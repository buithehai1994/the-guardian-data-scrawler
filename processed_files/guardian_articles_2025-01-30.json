She will be dearly missed.”With a discography that spanned classic 60s pop tunes to the prowling synthpop of Broken English and onto collaborations with Nick Cave, Warren Ellis, Lou Reed and more, Faithfull was idolised by fans and fellow musicians alike, and was also celebrated across the worlds of fashion and film.Mick Jagger, with whom she had a four-year relationship, said: “I am so saddened to hear of the death of Marianne Faithfull. She was so much part of my life for so long. She was a wonderful friend, a beautiful singer and a great actress. She will always be remembered.”Born in 1946 in London, Faithfull was descended from Austrian nobility on her mother’s side – her great-great-uncle Leopold von Sacher-Masoch wrote the erotic novel Venus in Furs – but grew up in relatively ordinary surroundings in a terraced house in Reading.View image in fullscreenWith Alain Delon in the 1968 film The Girl on a Motorcycle.Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/ShutterstockAfter leaving for London in her teens, she met Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham, who asked Mick Jagger and Keith Richards to write her 1964 debut single As Tears Go By, which hit the UK Top 10. She had three other Top 10 singles in 1965, all of which also reached the Top 40 in the US.Faithfull also began acting at that time, appearing on stage in productions of Chekhov’s Three Sisters, alongside Glenda Jackson, and Hamlet, playing Ophelia with Anjelica Huston as her understudy and performing each night’s climactic “madness” scene, she later revealed, high on heroin.On screen, she acted alongside Orson Welles, Oliver Reed, Alain Delon and Anna Karina, and played herself inJean-Luc Godard’s 1966 film Made in the USA.Her fame as an icon of “swinging London” was superseded, though, by the infamy that came from her relationship with the Rolling Stones. She had married the artist John Dunbar in 1965 and had a son, Nicholas, but soon left Dunbar for Mick Jagger.She was often described as a muse for the band: she once told Jagger “wild horses couldn’t drag me away”, which became the chorus line to Wild Horses, andher drug strugglesalso proved inspirational for the songs Dear Doctor and You Can’t Always Get What You Want. She said: “I know they used me as a muse for those tough drug songs. I knew I was being used, but it was for a worthy cause.”View image in fullscreenFaithfull photographed in the mid-1960s.Photograph: Terry O’Neill/Iconic ImagesShe co-wrote her song Sister Morphine, recorded with Jagger, Richards and Ry Cooder, and later recorded by the Rolling Stones for their album Sticky Fingers, but her writing credit was left off until she won a protracted legal battle.Her addiction to cocaine and heroin worsened, and her reputation was damaged by being discovered naked,wrapped in a fur rug after having a shower,during a 1967 police search of Keith Richards’ house, alongside Richards, Jagger and six other men (described by one person as an innocent gathering “of pure domesticity”). “It destroyed me,” she later said. “To be a male drug addict and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorising. A woman in that situation becomes a slut and a bad mother.”In 1970, Faithfull lost custody of her son, split with Jagger and became homeless, living on the streets of Soho in London as she tried to quit heroin. “I’d been living in a very fake sort of world in the 60s,” she said in 2016. “Suddenly, when I was living on the streets … I realised that human beings were really good. The Chinese restaurant let me wash my clothes there. The man who had the tea stall gave me cups of tea.” She slowly turned her life around, ending an almost decade-long spell away from music with the country album Dreamin’ My Dreams in 1976.View image in fullscreenFaithfull and Mick Jagger in 1969.Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty ImagesFrom Godard to Coppola, Van Sant to Anger, Marianne Faithfull was a dazzling magnet for film-makersRead moreShe cemented her comeback with one of her most acclaimed albums, 1979’s Grammy-nominated Broken English, embracing synthpop and postpunk with an affectingly raw, deepened voice. She quit drugs for good in 1985, and regularly released music throughout the rest of her career. Her collaborators over the years included Nick Cave, Damon Albarn, Emmylou Harris, Beck and Metallica. She released 21 studio albums.Faithfull married and divorced two additional times, to Ben Brierly of punk band the Vibrators, and the actor Giorgio Della Terza. “I’ve had a wonderful life with all my lovers, and husbands,” she said in 2011, excepting Della Terza: “He was American, and he was a nightmare.”There were other acting roles, too, notably playing God in two episodes of the sitcom Absolutely Fabulous; the devil in a 2004 production of The Black Rider, a musical by Tom Waits and William Burroughs; and Empress Maria Theresa inSofia Coppola’s film Marie Antoinette.View image in fullscreenFaithfull performing at the Bataclan in Paris, November 2016.Photograph: François Guillot/AFP/Getty ImagesIn her later years she lived in Paris, and reacted to the 2015 terror attack at the city’s Bataclan concert venue, in which 90 people were killed, with a song called They Come at Night written on the day of the attacks.Faithfull had numerous health issues. In 2007, she announced she had the liver illness hepatitis C, having been diagnosed 12 years previously. She had successful surgery following a breast cancer diagnosis in 2006, and weathered numerous joint ailments in her later years, including arthritis. In the early 1970s, she also suffered from anorexia during her heroin addiction. In 2020, she contracted Covid-19 andwas hospitalised for 22 days.She is survived by her son, Nicholas Dunbar.Explore more on these topicsMusicMarianne FaithfullPop and rockThe Rolling StonesnewsShareReuse this content"

Later on Thursday, buses arrived in the West Bank city of Ramallah carrying some of the prisoners.It was not the first crisis in a ceasefire deal that is not yet two weeks old. Yehoud had originally been listed for release on Saturday. When four female soldiers were handed over instead, Israel accusedHamasof violating the deal and suspended plans to allow Palestinian civilians to return to northern Gaza.After last-minute negotiations, Hamas confirmed Yehoud would be freed on Thursday with two other hostages and Israel opened checkpoints to northern Gaza on Monday.Shortly after the Thursday handover of the seven hostages in southern Gaza, Trump’s envoy for the region, Steven Witkoff, made a brief visit to Hostage Square in Tel Aviv.View image in fullscreenCrowds gather in Khan Younis for the release of Palestinian hostages as part of a ceasefire and prisoner exchange deal between Hamas and Israel.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPAMany people, when they realised Witkoff was there, raced to pay personal tribute to him for brokering the ceasefire agreement. “Thank you for freeing the hostages, thank you to Mr Trump,” one shouted.He met families of hostages briefly in a public library beside the square, assuring them he was optimistic the deal would hold, Israeli media reported, and said he was committed to bringing home the living held in Gaza and the dead.International Unrwa staff leave as Israel’s ban on activity takes effectRead moreThe first stage of the ceasefire is due to last 42 days and covers the release of 33 Israeli hostages, mostly women and older men. Of the 23 still to be released as part of the first phase, Hamas says eight are dead. Under the agreement, Israel will free about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and increase aid into Gaza.Shortly after Thursday’s handover, Hamas confirmed the death of Mohammed Deif, the head of its military wing, six months after Israel announced he had been killed. It was the first statement that Hamas has released on Deif’s condition since the Israeli military said last August that he had been killed in an airstrike in southern Gaza the month before.Witkoff was visiting Israel before negotiations on the second phase of the deal, due to start on Monday, and went from Hostage Square to hold talks with Netanyahu. The Israeli leader faces heavy pressure from far-right members of his coalition to restart the war rather than extend the ceasefire.Trump’s envoy also visited Gaza with the Israeli military and met the four female soldiers freed on Saturday at the Israeli hospital where they were being treated.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I want to thank Trump,” he said. His hopes of seeing his son again rested entirely on the US leader, he added.He said that for one day he had put his own worries aside to celebrate, because after 15 months of intense campaigning, everyone held in Gaza feels like family. “I think all the time about [Omri’s return], but today I concentrate on the joy.”Miran was part of the crowd waiting in Hostages Square to watch the releases in real time, beside a clock broadcasting a countdown of the days, hours and minutes of the hostages’ captivity.Schoolchildren and parents pushing babies in prams mixed with adults who had taken the day off to be there for a “historic moment”, most veterans of the long campaign for a ceasefire deal.They cheered and wept when the first footage streamed from Gaza showed Berger walking unaided. Like the four other female soldiers freed last weekend, she was dressed in military-style fatigues and put on stage for a ceremony that served as a show of the militants’ power after 15 months of war.“She made it,” said Yahel Oren, 31, who served a decade ago at the Nahal Oz base, where Berger was captured by Hamas, and watched the video in tears. “It’s hard to think of her alone there, but at least we can count the minutes she has left.”View image in fullscreenPeople in Tel Aviv gather in Hostages Square to watch the release of hostages on a giant screen.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyOren was part of a group campaigning for the freedom of the female “spotter” troops held in Gaza, and was wearing a T-shirt saying: “Once a spotter always a spotter.”Attention then shifted to the south, where seven hostages were due to be freed. Shlomo Zidkiahv, 83, waved a Thai flag in solidarity with a group of Thais taken hostage while working on one of the kibbutzim that was attacked.He carried photos of all six still in Gaza, as neither Hamas nor Israel had initially identified the five who would be freed. They were later named as Thenna, Suwannakham, Sriaoun, Seathao and Rumnao.The release of Moses, the first Israeli man freed in this exchange, was taken by many in the crowd as a tacit acknowledgment that the last living women held in Gaza had been released.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesHamasBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

Ministers argued that the use of hotels to house asylum seekers was an“incentive”for small boat crossings.Life and death on the Bibby Stockholm: ‘No one wanted to go inside – but we had no choice’Read moreIn July 2023, shortly before the first asylum seekers were due to come onboard, the Guardian highlightedsafety concerns about the barge, including disquiet about narrow corridors, fire safety, crowding two people into bedrooms previously used by one occupant and a lack of lifejackets.Five days after the first 39 men moved in, they had to be removed from the vessel after legionella bacteria, a potentially deadly bacteria,was discovered in the water systemin August 2023.In December 2023,Leonard Farruku, a musician who was seeking asylum after travelling from Albania, is thought to have killed himself on the barge.More than 60 charities and three Labour MPs then demanded the immediate closure of the barge, in aletter published in the Guardian.The signatories write: “For those on board, theBibby Stockholmfeels like a prison. It is cramped, restrictive and segregated. The barge is no place to accommodate people who have fled violence, persecution, and torture, many of whom are traumatised and isolated. They are unable to get the help and specialist support they need. Their mental health has deteriorated and some have felt suicidal.”Within days of getting into power in July last year,the government decided to discontinuethe previous government’s contract to house asylum seekers on the vessel.Extending its use would have cost more than £20m next year, according to the Home Office.In November, when the barge was decommissioned, the total number of people in the UK still waiting for their asylum claims to be processed was estimated to be about 86,000.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

But the higher average levels found in the shorter pregnancies were a “big surprise” for the researchers, as longer terms could be expected to lead to more accumulation.Preterm birth is theleading cause of infant deathworldwide, and the reasons for about two-thirds of all preterm births were unknown, said Dr Enrico Barrozo, of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, US. The established link betweenair pollution and millions of premature birthshad spurred the research team to investigate plastic pollution.The new study only demonstrates an association between microplastics and premature births. Further research is needed in cell cultures and animal models to determine if the link is causal. Microplastics are known to cause inflammation in human cells, and inflammation is one of the factors that prompts the start of labour.Microplastics, broken down from plastic waste, have polluted the entire planet from thesummit of Mount Everestto thedeepest oceans. People are already known to consume the tiny particlesvia food,waterand bybreathing them in.Microplastics werefirst detected in placentas in 2020and have also been found insemen,breast milk,brains, livers and bone marrow, indicating profuse contamination of people’s bodies. The impact on human health is little known, but microplastics have beenlinked to strokes and heart attacks.“Our study hints at the possibility that the accumulation of plastics could be contributing to the occurrence of preterm birth,” said Prof Kjersti Aagaard, at Boston children’s hospital in the US. “Combined with other recent research, this study adds to the growing body of evidence that demonstrates a real risk from exposure to plastics on human health and disease.”Theresearchwas presented on Thursday at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine’s annual meeting in Denver, and has been submitted to an academic journal. The researchers analysed 100 placentas from full-term births (37.2 weeks, on average) and 75 from preterm births (34 weeks), all from the Houston area.Analysis with highly sensitive mass spectrometry found 203 micrograms of plastic per gram of tissue (µg/g) in the premature placentas – more than 50% higher than the 130µg/g in the full-term placentas.Twelve types of plastic were detected, with the most significant differences between the full and preterm birth placentas being for PET, as used in plastic bottles, PVC, polyurethane and polycarbonate.Some mothers are at higher risk of preterm births, due to their age, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. But a strong link between the plastic particles and premature birth remained even when these factors were taken into account.“This study showed an association and not causation,” said Barrozo. “But I think it is important to increase people’s awareness of microplastics and their associations with potential human health effects.”The effectiveness of actions to cut people’s exposure to microplastics also needed urgent study, he said. “Those interventions need to be studied in order to show that there’s a benefit to avoiding these plastics.”Explore more on these topicsPlasticsPollutionPremature birthMedical researchPregnancyHealthChildbirthnewsShareReuse this content"

Did you see the vehicle – a distinctive gold Land Rover Defender – in the lead-up to the collision?“We believe there were people in the local area who have not been spoken to by police and remain unidentified. I would ask those individuals to please contact us. Our main priority is to ensure the lines of inquiry identified by the review are progressed.“This is a live investigation and in order to maintain its integrity I can’t go into further detail at this stage. I would urge people to avoid speculation.”On Tuesday, the girls’ parents said in a statement: “We welcomed the reopening of the investigation in October 2024 by the Metropolitan police into the death of our beautiful girls and the harm caused to those injured and who witnessed the tragedy on that sunny July day.“It is important that this investigation runs its course unhindered and that each step taken is done so in the pursuit of truth and the full facts. As the investigation continues, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Further messages were sent that indicated a sexual and sadistic motivation, the police said.DNA tests found traces of Mayhew’s blood in the bedroom and elsewhere in Samson’s flat.It is believed Mayhew was murdered on 8 March, the day she entered Samson’s flat. Two days later, Samson was captured buying a hacksaw, blades and a bucket. Watts was also seen on CCTV buying cleaning products, including bleach and scourers, and a silver incinerator bin.“Having committed the murder they then made very extensive efforts to pervert the course of justice over a number of days,” Little told the court. He added that the murder had been planned and premeditated.Nearly a month after Mayhew died, her remains were discovered in Rowdown Fields in New Addington by a dog walker. Other body parts were found in the River Wandle in Mitcham.Mayhew had two children, aged 12 and 15 when she was killed, and had “the rest of her life ahead of her”, said DCI Martin Thorpe, from the Specialist Crime Command.In a victim impact statement, Mayhew’s mother, Angela, said of her daughter: “It breaks my heart she is not around.”Her father, David, thanked the defendants forpleading guiltyand saving his family from the ordeal of sitting through a trial. He added: “That said, whatever sentence you may receive will never compare to the pain you have caused us.“I ask myself the same question all the time: why did you have to kill her? Maybe I will never know.”Explore more on these topicsLondonCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

He faces more than 50 charges including criminal damage, burglary, shop theft and theft of a motor vehicle.‘Giant colouring book’: how money and paint mix in Melbourne’s street art sceneRead more“In one of the most high-profile incidents, it’s alleged the man scaled and defaced the heritage listed Flinders Street railway station clock tower on 10 July 2024,” police said.View image in fullscreenPam the Bird graffiti on an apartment building in Melbourne.Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian“It’s alleged he is also responsible for graffiti plastered across the rail network as well as the ‘Cheese Stick’ column on CityLink, a television station building in Docklands and concrete silos on Mercer Street in Geelong.“In the latest incident graffiti was on 20 January 2025 daubed across a hotel in South Wharf.”Police alleged the graffiti has caused more than $100,000 in damage in total.“The man has also been charged over an incident in Footscray where an allegedly stolen car was driven through the front window of a Barkly Street restaurant early on 20 December 2024,” police said.Police alleged they had also seized spray paint, illegal fireworks, abseiling equipment and property suspected to be the proceeds of crime.The man has been remanded to appear at Melbourne magistrates court on Friday.The underground graffiti movement has thrived for decades across the globe, and Melbourne is regarded as one of its most significant cities.Within this movement, the ability to paint quickly and skilfully without being caught – despite the risks posed by moving trains and increasingly motivated law enforcement – is highly valued, one artist told Guardian Australia this week.Dean Sunshine, who has spent years documenting and curating street art in Melbourne, summed up the fascination behind Pam the Bird as “location, location, location”.“It’s the most prolific thing in Melbourne right now … it gets a lot of respect from the graffiti world because of the amount of artwork that’s going up and the positions of the artwork,” he said.“It’s the positions … and getting to spots that are really hard to get to. That’s what’s making Pam the Bird such a legendary part of Melbourne graffiti culture.”Allow Facebook content?This article includes content provided by Facebook.

This is out and out vandalism, and it needs to stop,” he said. “This is not a victimless crime. The city’s pride and reputation is being affected.”He pointed to Melbourne’s designated legal spaces for street art, mostnotably famed Hosier Lane, which also features government-commissioned murals and artwork spruiking brands.“Pam the bird, could go quite some way improving the quality of the art, and we’re here to help on that front. We can give artistic guidance,” he said.But a veteran graffitist told Guardian Australia that it was frustrating that governments openly welcomed places like Hosier Lane, but cracked down on graffiti. It was the same as a government saying it loved AFL but hated community Australian rules teams – it was impossible for there to be one without the other.The Victorian opposition leader, Brad Battin, this month unveiled a proposal to require the Department of Transport and Planning to remove graffiti from public freeways within 24 hours.Police have also arrested a 39-year-old man from Abbotsford as part of the investigation.He has been charged with more than 20 criminal damage offences relating to the alleged graffiti of suburban trains and the Docklands office building, and was also due to appear in court today.Explore more on these topicsMelbourneStreet artVictorianewsShareReuse this content"

An investigation of the crash is under way, but few are waiting for its results to jump to their lines of attack.Aviation security and the air traffic control industry have been subject to partisan wrangling for years, and the American Airlinesjet crash, which left no survivors, comes amid much upheaval in the aviation world. On Thursday, Donald Trump blamed diversity in the ranks of air traffic controllers and jumped quickly to criticizing his predecessors for lapses in aviation security.Trump baselessly blames DEI and Democrats for Washington DC plane crashRead moreThe crash also comes as Trump’s new administration is cleaning out the facets of government it disagrees with – including freezing hiring and requiring in-person work arrangements.At a press conference on Thursday morning, Trump said “we have very strong opinions and ideas” about how the accident happened, then took political swipes at Barack Obama and Joe Biden over air traffic controller standards.He complained about diversity and inclusion measures, and called the former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg a “disaster” who has a “good line in bullshit”.Notably, when the Trump administration came in on 20 January, it started swiftly firing federal employees, meaning the Federal Aviation Administration’s leadership is nowdottedwith vacancies. There is no Senate-confirmed administrator leading the agency.Michael Whitaker, the administrator under Biden, left the agency after Elon Musk, the billionaire Trump supporter, demanded he resign, the Daily Beastreported. TrumpnominatedChris Rocheleau to lead the agency in the aftermath of the crash.Also of note: there has been a years-long shortage of air traffic controllers, which the FAA has been working to address. Alongside the shortage is an increase in near misses.A New York Timesinvestigationin 2023 found “potentially dangerous incidents are occurring far more frequently than almost anyone realizes – a sign of what many insiders describe as a safety net under mounting stress”.The Washington DC airspace is also crowded, seeing a high volume of commercial planes and military aircraft – a cause for concernfor many years. The 2024 FAA reauthorization bill added five incoming and five outgoing flights to Washington national airport each day, which Democratic senators from Maryland and Virginia warned would be a safety risk. Supporters of the bill in part wanted more direct routes to their home states.“The very title of the ‘Direct Access to the Capital Act’ gives the game away that this bill is written to maximize the personal convenience of a comparatively small number of powerful, well-connected individuals at the expense of safety and efficiency of flights – which should be our top priority,” Congressman Don Beyer of Virginia told the Washington Postat the time.The Trump administration’s federal hiring freeze and return-to-work mandates could have affected federal aviation employees, though it’s unclear to what extent.The blanket hiring freezesaidthat “no federal civilian position that is vacant at noon on January 20 2025, may be filled, and no new position may be created”, but exempted public safety positions, which could include air traffic control.Democratic lawmakers believe the hiring freeze applies to air traffic controllers. The ranking member of the House committee on transportation and infrastructure, Rick Larsen, issued astatementsaying the freeze would contradict the 2024 FAA reauthorization bill that requires the agency to hire the maximum number of controllers.“Hiring air traffic controllers is the No 1 safety issue according to the entire aviation industry,” Larsen said. “Instead of working to improve aviation safety and lower costs for hardworking American families, the administration is choosing to spread bogus DEI claims to justify this decision.”Trump forced out the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) administrator, David Pekoske, as well, andguttedan aviation security advisory committee. A prior division leader at the TSAwarnedthat the effort to end remote work would lead to attrition and a loss of knowledge at the agency.Conservatives often blame the air traffic controller shortage on diversity measures, a line of attack so frequent that one of Trump’s executive ordersspecifically focusedon ending the FAA’s diversity programs, part of a government-wide push against these programs in the new administration.Afactsheetabout the order alleged that the FAA under Biden had “specifically recruited and hired individuals with ‘severe intellectual’ disabilities, psychiatric issues, and complete paralysis over other individuals who sought to work for the FAA”.Aviation groups have pushed back against the assertion that diversity programs make the air less safe.Tennessee Garvey, a pilot and the chair of the Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals,told NBC Newsthat DEI had been inappropriately “weaponized” and blamed for safety issues without any proof.“There’s never been any proof that DEI causes any safety issues, because it doesn’t,” he said.Explore more on these topicsWashington DC plane crashWashington DCUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Many interpreted Trump’s move as an attempt to further demonize undocumented migrants by conflating them with the terror suspects who were imprisoned at Guantánamo’s detention centre after the then secretary of defense Rumsfeld opened it for “enemy combatants” three months after the 11 September 2001 attacks.“This is political theater and part of the Trump administration’s broader effort to paint immigrants as threats in the United States … and fan anti-immigrant sentiment,” said Eleanor Acer, the senior director for refugee protection at the advocacy group Human Rights First.Vincent Warren, head of the Center for Constitutional Rights legal advocacy group, said: “Trump’s order [sends] a clear message … Migrants and asylum seekers are being cast as the new terrorist threat, deserving to be discarded in an island prison, removed from legal and social services and supporters”.There was even stronger condemnation in Latin America, from where many of the migrants expected to end up in Trump’s camp hail. Aneditorialin Mexico’s leftwing newspaper La Jornada called the move “institutionalized sadism” and a Trumpian “spectacle of violence” designed to excite hardcore supporters. “The reopening of an international symbol of human rights abuses is a signal to Trumpists who believe the workers of the global south deserve the same punishment as supposed members of al-Qaida and the Islamic State,” it said.“What Trump is doing in sending migrants to Guantánamo – a place of torture and death – makes me think that the author of the book about Trump being the antichrist is on to something,” tweeted the Brazilian theologian Leonardo Boff.Adam Isacson, a migration expert from the Washington Office on Latin America thinktank, said Trump’s headline-grabbing initiative was “absolutely part of the narrative” that a military response was needed to tackle the supposed threat from migrants, whom the recently installed US president has repeatedly cast as dangerous “animals” and “trash”.“And the idea is to just scare the hell out of immigrant communities all around the United States too,” Isacson added. “They’re just trying to scare people and maybe scare people into just making their own arrangements and leaving the country on their own.

Those migrants have been held in a separate part of the base from alleged terrorists, 15 of whom are now imprisoned there, compared with hundreds after al-Qaida’s 9/11 attacks. The most notorious isKhalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged Pakistani mastermind of that plot.It remains uncertain precisely whom Trump might send to his expanded Guantánamo camp and whether it will be used to hold migrants accused or convicted of crimes or simply anyone lacking documents.Acer said the “outrageously vague and incredibly sweeping language” in Trump’s memorandum ordering Guantánamo’s expansion meant it was unclear who would be targeted. The three-paragraph directive calls for “all appropriate actions” to be taken to expand the facility in order to “address attendant immigration enforcement needs”.However, the activist called the president’s comment that the base was “tough” to escape “a disturbing signal that the Trump administration may be planning to hold people there indefinitely”.During George W Bush’s “war on terror”, “the US chose to hold people on the Guantánamo base because they believed that it would be removed from legal scrutiny,” Acer recalled.Now she suspected Trump also planned to treat it “as a sort of rights-free zone”. “The whole thing is just absurd … Guantánamo is essentially designed to prevent outside scrutiny. Human rights abuses will be hidden,” Acer warned, adding: “The Trump administration is thumbing its nose at the law and the rule of law.”Explore more on these topicsGuantánamo BayUS immigrationTrump administrationDonald TrumpCubaUS politicsAmericasanalysisShareReuse this content"

Will he not think of his fellow middle-aged men?His bronzed torso is ridiculously ripped – and will, once again, cause a shift in the acceptable minimum standards for the male physiqueTim DowlingThu 30 Jan 2025 16.30 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 16.34 ESTShareSo much for the dad bod. David Beckham, who turns 50 this year, has released pictures of himself modelling his new bodywear collection for Hugo Boss. Bodywear, if you’re unfamiliar with the term, appears to mean underwear. In thecorresponding ad clip, Beckham returns home for the day in his vintage Aston Martin, Bond-style, but he can’t wait to rip off his sharp suit and slouch around in a leather armchair in nothing but his tighty-whities. He has set the bar very high for middle-aged dads who like to relax by sitting around drinking in their pants, Homer Simpson-style. If you feel at all self-conscious about your soft, squishy, beer-induced centre, Beckham’s new line of smalls will not help.In recent years, the dad bod seemed to be on the verge of widespread public acceptance, even cautious celebration, and a lot of us were congratulating ourselves on our timing: it was not uncommon for men of a certain age to emerge from the first pandemic lockdown looking like a heap of overproved sourdough. We felt ourselves, however unintentionally, to be in the dad bod vanguard – more oven-ready than beach-ready; soft, saggy and proud.View image in fullscreenBeckham appears to be out of step with the new paradigm: untimely ripped, as Shakespeare might have put it. Not to mention bronzed, sculpted and manscaped. And it’s the end of January – exactly the time when we all inquire about what kind of refund we can claim from our ill-advised, unused new gym memberships. It would be fair to say he just doesn’t get it.Unfortunately, his outsize influence on our culture probably means a shift in acceptable minimum standards for the male physique, especially for us 50-and-overs, who thought we’d safely escaped scrutiny. If it’s possible to look like Beckham at 50 – and it seems it is – then the rest of us are transparently not committed enough. You don’t get that kind of physique by standing on one leg while you brush your teeth.View image in fullscreenWhat Beckham’s body really represents to the average fiftysomething male is, of course, the slippage of time – all the fitness that might have been ours but isn’t, because we never set aside the hours. And now those hours are gone.But even if you were committed to the amount of training required, who among us, in the last decade, has had the time? Forget exercise – I don’t think I could have even managed to collect as many tattoos as Beckham has. I look at all that ink and think: how would I juggle the appointments?Looking like David Beckham is David Beckham’s job – the rest of us have other jobs, and precious little spare time to spend drinking in our underwear in whatever condition our condition is in. The Finns call itkalsarikännit– the art of drinking at home in your pants – and this important form of relaxation would be completely undone by any obligation to look like Beckham in his signature bodywear.Nobody looks back on their deathbed and says, “I wish I’d done more crunches.” Unless you happen to be dying of something directly caused by a lack of core strength. In which case: for shame.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleMenDavid BeckhamMen's fashionUnderwear for menFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At that point, British rock and pop resolutely inhabited a world shaped by punk: it was the year of 2-Tone and Tubeway Army’s Are ‘Friends’ Electric?, of Ian Dury at No 1 and Blondie releasing the bestselling album of the year. And it was a central tenet of punk that the 1960s and their attendant “culture freaks” were, as Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren put it: “fucking disgusting … vampiric … the most narcissistic generation there has ever been,” and that the decade’s famous names should no longer be afforded the kind of awed reverence they had enjoyed for most of the 70s. “No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones,” as the Clash had sung.And yet Marianne Faithfull,who has died aged 78, turned out to be the kind of famous face from the 60s that a world shaped by punk could get behind. She was living proof that the rock aristocracy were remote and decadent and ripe for the culling. Never given the credit due to her by her most famous associates, the Rolling Stones, she had to go to court to get her name appended to the credits of Sister Morphine, a song she had co-written. She subsequently spiralled downwards, at startling speed, from having a seat at swinging London’s top table to life as a homeless junkie. Her years of addiction on the streets had so ravaged her voice that, by the late 70s, it was completely unrecognisable as coming from the woman who had sung As Tears Go By and Come and Stay With Me.So, while Mick Jagger was nastily dismissed in the theme song to the Sex Pistols’ film The Great Rock‘n’Roll Swindle, Faithfull was offered a part in it, as Sid Vicious’s mother. Her comeback gig was at the Music Machine, a bearpit venue where Bob Geldof had been punched in the face mid-song. Moreover, the ensuing album,Broken English, fitted perfectly. It was filled with enough bile, bad language and provocation (what was the daughter of a baroness doing singing John Lennon’s Working Class Hero?) to give Johnny Rotten pause. The songs picked through the wreckage of the decade that had made her famous with unmistakable relish – how the era’s penchant for mind expansion and radical politics had curdled into addiction and terrorism – or railed at the way women were treated: the album is populated by a female cast of suicidal housewives, betrayed lovers and oblivion-seekers.View image in fullscreen‘I was just cheesecake really, terribly depressing’ ... Marianne Faithfull in 1964.Photograph: CA/RedfernsIt was all performed with conviction: she sounded like she meant it. Of course, Faithfull was an actor, but you could also see why she might be genuinely pissed off, and not merely because of her fall from grace. Her initial burst of fame may have looked good from the outside – she was beautiful, she had hit singles, she was the partner of one of the biggest pop stars in the world. But there was something dismissive and sexist about the way she was treated as if she were “somebody who not only can’t even sing but doesn’t really write or anything, just something you can make into something,” she later recalled. “I was just cheesecake really, terribly depressing”.The Stones’ manager Andrew Loog Oldham, who launched her singing career, described her as “an angel with big tits”. The records she made strongly suggested that music came low on his list of priorities: he saw her as a means of living out his fantasy of becoming a British Phil Spector, and as a light entertainer: a pretty, posh girl whose niche would be essaying folk songs for an MOR, Saturday-night variety show audience. When he got his way, the results were horrendous: her version of Dylan’s Blowin’ in the Wind is terrible; her version of Greensleeves, larded with a production that saw Oldham doing his best Spector impersonation, is even worse.But Faithfull was smarter than to fall under the sway of a svengali. She had other ideas about pop music, and, as it turned out, they were better than his. Initially, her best records dealt in a very English, very wintry-sounding brand of orchestral pop: on This Little Bird, Go Away from My World, Morning Sun or Tomorrow’s Calling, the arrangements twinkled like frost; you can imagine Faithfull’s breath forming clouds in front of her face as she sings.The material was lightweight but something about Faithfull’s performances injected a note of eeriness: her vocals were more yearning and melancholy than the songs needed them to be. It was a side of her work that might have developed fruitfully in the psychedelic era, but by then Faithfull had lost interest in singing, apparently content to be Mick Jagger’s muse. It was a role she was good at – it was Faithfull who got him to read Bulgakov’s The Master and Margarita, which inspired Sympathy for the Devil – but it seemed a shame: the first of a number of bad decisions Faithfull made regarding her career.The second was that, having been sharp enough to quickly ditch Oldham as her producer and insist her label simultaneously release two albums – one pop, one folk – she didn’t fight harder to stop her record company pulling her 1969 comeback single Something Better. This was far grittier than anything she’d released before – country-ish, with Ry Cooder on slide guitar – but the problem, as her label saw it, was the B-side, her original version of Sister Morphine: so bleak and so obviously written by someone who knew of what she spoke that they balked and withdrew it entirely.As she sank further into addiction, there were more missed opportunities. A 1971 album, Masques, went unreleased. By the time of its recording, her personal situation was desperate and her 60s producer, Mike Leander, had concocted it primarily as a means of helping her. Faithfull later dismissed its contents but it was better than she thought, the material well-chosen and apropos; her performances raw and vulnerable. Her versions of Phil Ochs’ Chords of Fame and Terry Reid’s Rich Kid Blues were powerful in a way her 60s hits were not. Two years later, she appeared on David Bowie’s TV special The 1980 Floor Show, wearing a nun’s habit, sounding like Nico and duetting with him on a version of I Got You Babe. She could have reinvented herself for the glam era – her public image certainly had a suitable amount of decadence attached – but Faithfull was visibly still in a bad way, and nothing more happened.It took Broken English to finally re-establish Faithfull, even if it initially looked like a one-off. Its followup albums, Dangerous Acquaintances and A Child’s Adventure were less striking and edgy, although the latter’s closing track, She’s Got a Problem, had some of Broken English’s bite. The 1987 album Strange Weather was another triumph, its mood dark and affecting, with Faithfull as a dramatic and gifted interpreter of songs, rather than a writer, on selections ranging from Leadbelly, Tom Waits and Bob Dylan to the Great American Songbook.She repeated the trick with Brecht and Weill songs on the live album 20th Century Blues (1996), and later recorded an entire album of their material, The Seven Deadly Sins (1998). She also began attracting a noticeably hipper class of collaborator than any of her more commercially successful 60s peers. The superb 2002 albumKissin’ Timealone featured contributions from Beck, Pulp, Billy Corgan and Blur (the title track, with Blur, very much in the vein of the looser, more experimental music found on Blur’s album 13, was a particular highlight). The 2005 albumBefore the Poisonwas essentially split between collaborations with PJ Harvey, operating in minimalist garage-rock mode, and Nick Cave.View image in fullscreenA dramatic and gifted interpreter of songs ... Marianne Faithfull later in her career.Photograph: HO/ReutersFaithfull self-deprecatingly suggested that younger artists flocked to work with her because they enjoyed hearing her war stories from the 60s, but the reality was that she was willing to take risks, challenge herself and push at the boundaries of public perception:Easy Come, Easy Goreunited her with Keith Richards, but elsewhere on the same album she covered songs by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and the Decemberists and duetted with Anohni and Cat Power.She would occasionally delve into her history, revisiting As Tears Go By and Broken English’s Witches Song onNegative Capability(2018), or underline her place among the rock aristocracy by tapping Elton John, Lou Reed and Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters for songs or guest appearances. But you would never accuse her of trading on past glories, or of knocking out an album in order to tour and play the hits, as many of her peers were evidently doing.For someone whose public image was inexorably linked with what she had done 50 years earlier, she seemed artistically intent on pressing forward, in establishing herself in a context that had more to do with Anna Calvi and Mark Lanegan than the Rolling Stones. “She walked through the whole thing on her own terms,” noted Warren Ellis, Nick Cave’s latterday musical foil, who co-produced Negative Capability. It’s not hard to imagine Faithfull would have thought that a fitting epitaph.Explore more on these topicsMusicMarianne FaithfullPop and rockExperimental musiccommentShareReuse this content"

Our thoughts and prayers go out to him at this difficult time. Mel has always operated near the margins of Westminster. A liminal presence teetering near the vanishing point where earth and sky meet.His time as work and pensions secretary under Rishi Sunak went almost entirely unnoticed, but for his undying loyalty. Long after Rish! had given up the election as a lost cause, he could be heard as the lone Tory voice of government on the airwaves. Each morning he would ask No 10 for advice on what the Conservative message should be, only to get no reply. It was almost heartbreaking.Since the Tories have been in opposition, things have gone from bad to worse for the Melster. He may have been given the title of shadow chancellor, but that means next to nothing. The Tories are proud of the fact they have no economic policies as yet and, in any case, are in no position to implement them. All of which makes Stride an irrelevance. A political ornament. There to make up the numbers. No one is interested in what he has to say. Not even his colleagues. They recognise he has little understanding of economics, and appreciate his existential futility.But every dog has his day. So this sketch is dedicated to Mel. To celebrate his achievements, lest he be forgotten once more. Even the losers get lucky some time. Because on this auspicious Thursday, Stride got the call from the Today programme. Would he like to come on? They would be doing a long interview withRachel Reevesin the prestigious 8.10am slot to talk about her growth plans and the producer had had the mad idea it might be fun to get some reaction from the Tories. See what they had to say on the subject.It hadn’t got off to the best of starts. Mel had been ready and waiting by the phone at 8.40am. The time the researcher had told him he would be talking to the nation. He waited and waited. Hearing only the hold muzak. Over on the Today programme the editors had decided it would be much more fun to overrun with an extended package on kamikaze shoplifting. Something the listeners might actually be interested in.Eventually, the Melster got the nod. “Thank you for coming on,” said Emma Barnett. She couldn’t have sounded more fed up if she had tried. How come Justin Webb had landed the Reeves interview and she had been left with the shadow chancellor? There would be trouble after the show. But for now, there was nothing for it but to go through the motions.Rachel Reeves had said she was optimistic that flights would take off from the third Heathrow runway in 10 years, Barnett continued. What did Mel think? A trick question as Mel doesn’t really think. He does what he’s told. Stride rifled through the Tory playbook. All three pages of it. Not much help there. All he could do now was ad lib. Er … the Tories were broadly in favour of a third runway as it had been a Conservative plan in the first place. He omitted to say Boris Johnson had flown to Afghanistan for the day to avoid a vote.“You had 14 years to get this done,” said Emma, barely concealing her irritation.“We did do Crossrail and Hinkley Point,” Stride replied.“We’re talking about Heathrow.”“Oh. So we are. But Reeves should have been talking about plans that were going to happen this year.”A moment’s silence as everyone absorbed Mel’s latest burst of half-wittedness. He had basically committed the Tories to abandoning any long-term infrastructure plans. Anything that took more than a year was a no-no.But Stride had more to say. Much more to say. He studied his script. The economy had been in tip-top shape when theConservativeshad left office. No one had ever had it so good.Emma couldn’t believe her ears. The Tories had left a grim inheritance. Even Rishi Sunak had admitted that. She yawned. Mel was beginning to bore her.“You lost the election,” she snapped. Just get over it.He couldn’t. This wasn’t fair. He had so few opportunities to make a mark and he could feel this one slipping away from him. He tried repeating himself. The economy had been booming in July.“It can’t have been. If it had, you would have been voted back in,” observed Barnett. She could be seen making throat-slitting gestures towards the control desk. Get him off the line.For the time being, though, she was obliged to prolong the interview. Don’t let him get to you. No one’s paying attention to this interview. Just get to the end and move on. Try to keep things professional.“What are you offering voters at the May local elections?” she asked. “Will you promise to do away with the increase in employers’ national insurance contributions?”“We aren’t making any pledges,” Mel said, sadly. It remained Tory policy to have no policies at all. So he didn’t have anything to add.Emma yawned. Looked at her nails. That was quite enough, thank you. “I’m sorry, we’re short of time.” There was a vitally important item on a BBC drama about Jane Austen’s sister that couldn’t wait. Much more newsworthy than anything the shadow chancellor might have to say. Mel was left to talk to himself. He had been cut off after just six minutes. Some would call that an insult. For Stride, that’s just what passes for his life these days. A return to the land of futility. An interview that would go unremarked and soon forgotten. Except by me.Meanwhile, Reeves was doing a grand tour of every studio imaginable. There to promote her growth agenda. And to take lectures from Richard Madeley about her CV. Though it turned out that someone on Good Morning Britain has a sense of humour. Moments after he had finished interviewing the chancellor he had to front a discussion on shoplifting. Something ofwhich he has inside knowledge. Madeley was arrested for shoplifting in 1994 but cleared after a jury accepted he had forgotten to pay for champagne. What goes around, comes around.Explore more on these topicsMel StrideThe politics sketchConservativesHeathrow third runwayRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

But Jordan Kai Burnett, taking the lead role in this jukebox musical reinvention, is no wallflower. They storm the stage with the famous shears raised, imploring us to lift our hands and make some noise.Previously performed in Los Angeles, co-produced by Michelle Visage and ‘NSync’s Lance Bass, Scissorhandz lands in London like a fully fledged cult hit. Visage’s voiceover welcomes an audience of “beautiful weirdos” and treats us as a pre-existing fan club.View image in fullscreenImperious … Tricia Adele-Turner in Scissorhandz.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWriter-director Bradley Bredeweg has had fun with the set list, bringing together outsider anthems including Radiohead’s Creep and bands whose very names evoke Burton’s world, such as Smashing Pumpkins and Florence + the Machine. AScissor Sisterstrack was perhaps inevitable: Let’s Have a Kiki, a long-term drag favourite, fuels a party for the prying locals meeting the mysterious guest that Avon lady Peg (a sympathetic Emma Williams) brings home.That number is an outrageous high point for a show that is generally too reverential to succeed as parody and never embraces zaniness to the extent of Titanic spoofTitanique. Adult panto-style gags (in a show for over-12s, mind) sit alongside earnest sincerity. Humour and pathos are never blended as delicately as by Burton.The film was about a boy built by a man; the musical has a female inventor creating a child and focuses on gender identity as part of self-discovery. Unlike the tight-lipped Depp, Burnett gives us a character – known only as Scissorhands – who narrates their own story and belts out their feelings. It is an emotionally engaging central performance in a well-sung production; Dionne Gipson as the Inventor and Tricia Adele-Turner as an imperious neighbour also stand out.Bredeweg establishes an edgy momentum – Burnett literally running with scissors – but the robbery scene is bungled and the storytelling stalls when dragging out the love triangle between Scissorhands, Peg’s daughter Kim (Lauren Jones) and her boyfriend, Jim (Richard Carson). The projections and set design, both by James Pearse Connelly, are well integrated on a stage that has towering amps as a permanent backdrop to pastel-coloured suburban homes on wheels. Handfuls of fake snow and an airborne model for Scissorhands’ gothic home are part of a charming DIY aesthetic, although the unspectacular ice sculpture dampens the big romantic scene.A booted ensemble wear hoods and strappy black leather inspired by Scissorhands’ S&M-style outfit. The script emphasises Peg’s own isolation, making her a kindred spirit, and doomsayer Esmeralda (Annabelle Terry) becomes more flamboyant, especially singing Heaven Is a Place on Earth, which morphs into roof-raising congregation.As with all jukebox musicals, some lines simply distract while others hit home, such as Kim singing “you hold me without touch” from Gravity by Sara Bareilles. Music director and orchestrator Gregory Nabours’ macabre choral arrangement of Aerosmith’s Dream On manages to strike a similar tone to Danny Elfman’s film score. But the jumble of songs, played by a tight band, never quite finds a unified sound and the relationships between characters don’t all convince. It’s a fun and heartfelt show yet retains the air of a work-in-progress, as unfinished as a child with scissors for hands.AtSouthwark Playhouse Elephant, London, until 29 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsSouthwark PlayhouseTim BurtonScissor SistersAerosmithComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Recent attempts to replicate the big studio comedy for a streaming audience have almost all failed, from the intolerableVacation Friends moviesto Amazon’s heinousSpace Cadetto joyless big-star Netflix vehicles like the recent Diaz/Foxx messBack in Action. Even its stars have tried –Reese Witherspoonwith charmless rom-comYour Place or MineandWill Ferrellwith grating Christmas musicalSpirited– so expectations weren’t just low, they were deep underground.It also didn’t help that Amazon refused to provide screeners to press, a clear sign that something was up. But even with the many low bars this would all put in place, there’s a surprising amount of low-rent fun to be had here, a simple and silly crowd-pleaser smartly reliant on the high wattage appeal of two, top-of-game professionals. Maybe my enjoyment was also boosted by something else, an ongoing frustration with the industry’s inability to crown a new generation of not just legitimate movie stars but legitimate comedy stars (they seem to exist more on the outskirts now, supporting actors who are in desperate need of it).Opus review – John Malkovich plays an evil pop star in a silly horror dudRead moreI’m not quite sure the film would really survive without the two but writer-director Nicholas Stoller, who tried and failed to resurrect the big screen Apatow comedy with the unfairly malignedBros, knows exactly what he has and what he should do with it. Witherspoon is an actor who has teased us with brilliance in edgier films such asElection, Freeway, Pleasantville andWildyet has recently chosen the high-money, low-reward gloss ofThe Morning Show, one of the most mind-bogglingly awful shows on television. This might not be a film that pushes her too far out of type (that type being type A) but Stoller gives her a spikier, saltier character than we’ve seen in a while, letting her curse, swig white wine and call people road whores (the film’s humour is often remarkably and refreshingly juvenile).She plays reality TV producer Margot, living in LA and openly ashamed of her coarser family in the south, apart from sister Neve (the wonderful Meredith Hagner) who is getting married to her stripper boyfriend. As Margot insists herself as wedding planner, at the same time, Ferrell’s widowed father finds out his daughter (the also rather wonderful Geraldine Viswanathan) is also getting married, threatening their unusually close relationship. A mistake with scheduling means that both parties descend on a remote island at the same time, two weddings forced to share one space.It’s an R-rated spin onBride Wars, the Anne Hathaway-Kate Hudson comedy from 2009, a film even more reliant on star appeal to make it work. Stoller’s film is far superior (another low bar) as even without his leads, there are some very funny and specific little touches in the script. There are plenty of misses – a Jonas brother cameo, some overly absurdist physical comedy, a final song and dance – but they’re just about outdone by the hits – drunk Reese, a creepy father-daughter duet of a love song, every young person in the film using the word gaslighting without knowing what it means – and so the laugh quotient ends up higher than it has been for a while.The real win here is watching Witherspoon and Ferrell show off, both unrestrained by a harder rating and a more raucous script than the norm and while their escalation of bad behaviour might not be quite as bad as it could have been, they both make for wonderfully petty antiheroes. Witherspoon in particular is a total joy, a confident comedic actor who knows exactly how big to go without going full pantomime, the sharpest performance we have seen from her in years. While the film doesn’t exactly reach anywhere near real, heart-tugging emotion, the sentiment is unusually restrained and, in its portrayal of two people who have over-invested in someone who was always going to invest more in someone else, it’s effectively etched.Like so many weddings, it’s a little too busy with an abundance of characters and subplots to keep track of (although Celia Weston as Witherspoon’s awful southern mother is an obvious winner) and there’s a final left-of-field plot development that feels like it was suggested by a particularly stupid test audience. But there’s an unseasonably good time to be had here, invitation worth accepting.You’re Cordially Invited is now available on Amazon Prime VideoExplore more on these topicsComedy filmsReese WitherspoonWill FerrellComedyAmazon Prime VideoreviewsShareReuse this content"

The family in question are the Stauffers – married couple Myka and James and their children – who were, until very recently, colossally successful family vloggers.Director Rachel Mason’s series starts slowly, spending most of the first hour introducing the uninitiated to the world of YouTubers who specialise in filling their channels with videos of their gorgeous homes, gorgeous children and perfect lives, and to the fans who glom on to these affectless yet somehow intimate and generally wildly aspirational portraits of domestic bliss. “I was literally a part of their life every day,” says former devotee Hannah Cho. She and around 700,000 subscribers to The Stauffer Life channel watched as Myka revealed positive pregnancy tests, had babies, a miscarriage, gave house cleaning tips, appraisals of her post-partum body and altogether so much desirable content that she began to accumulate sponsorship deals and the family’s videos became the family’s (very) lucrative business.An Update on Our Family: the utterly shocking tale of the ‘family vloggers’ who ‘rehomed’ their adopted sonRead moreThis set-up could and should have been whipped through in half the time. The real meat of the documentary is what happens when you need to keep feeding the beast you have created. When your incomedepends on monetising your family, where does that lead? And can it possibly be anywhere good?Engagement with their channel goes through the roof when the Stauffers decide to adopt a three-year-old boy with special needs from China, whom they call Huxley. Myka has the name picked before she meets him, though no one around her seems to note that renaming a three-year-old child, and especially one with special needs, from a different culture, who is about to be yanked from it, is an extraordinary thing to do. But on they went, exhaustively documenting the process, including the first disastrous meeting with Huxley. Or “Huxley”. It dawns on a tearful James that the boy “had a full-blown mom” in his foster carer. “Poor kid,” he whispers.The determinedly cheerful journey back to America is filmed and packaged for their waiting, avaricious online audience. The demand for updates thereafter is insatiable, and for a couple of years they keep coming, including ones about the behavioural issues caused by Huxley’s autism and at least one from Myka noting that “he grieved so hard” and that she was “unprepared for what trauma truly looked like”. Then Huxley disappears from the family videos. Then previous videos containing him are deleted. Subscribers bombard the channel with questions. In 2020, the Stauffers posted a tearful video entitled An Update on OurFamilyexplaining that though they love him with all their hearts, Huxley has had to be placed with a different “forever family” better able to cope with his needs, the extent of which they had not fully understood at the time he was adopted.Their subscribers, and then – when the story went viral – the rest of the internet, took this news about as well as you would expect. A small amount of compassion was swamped by horror and disgust, by insults, anger, vitriol (directed mostly at Myka as a foul perversion of the maternal instinct), then death threats, then raging conspiracy theories that the Stauffers had sold him, killed him and God knows what else.Mason’s film raises questions about just about every compelling issue of the internet age. It looks at the ethics of parents filming children who cannot give consent and who would in any professional, paid context be subject to myriad safeguarding regulations. It looks at the parasocial relationships that develop between content creators and followers, and the dangers of “betraying” those attachments. It poses questions about the purity of creators’ motives, and when a line is crossed between the natural human impulse to share, even show off, the good things in one’s life and the need to curate an impossible perfection, especially once it becomes sponsored by rich brands. It looks at the optimism, arrogance and entitlement that can play a part in transnational adoptions. And it looks at those who jump on to an emotional bandwagon not because they were invested in the original story but because they are malevolent trolls dedicated to spitting into open wounds wherever they find them.The Stauffers refused to be involved with the film and their family channel has been offline since the backlash became uncontainable. So we will probably never know how many of their actions were driven by the greed for clicks, or whether it was simple benevolence throughout. But it is hard not to be reminded at every turn that the internet is the greatest unregulated experiment ever performed on humankind. And even harder not to conclude that, if it were possible, now might be a good time to end it.An Update on Our Family aired on Sky Documentaries and is on Now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionSocial mediaFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Average global temperatures rose to 1.6C above preindustrial levels, according to data from theEU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service(C3S) – a rise that led to extreme weather events and “misery to millions of people”, as one of the group’s experts toldthe Guardian.Less than a month into the new year,fireshave torn through huge swaths of Los Angeles, upending the lives of thousands. Donald Trump, aclimate denier, is pulling the country out of international climate agreements and setting back efforts to curb the rise of average global temperatures.All of this has resulted in a growing sense ofclimate despairamongexpertsandlaypeoplealike. Governments and corporations bear a huge portion of the responsibility. But what can individuals do in the face of such massive, global threats?“Everyone has an impact,” says Darby Hoover, senior resource specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). “Corporations are made up of individuals, states are made up of individuals. We need action at all levels.”What are the most effective steps one can take to reduce one’s environmental footprint? And how does one influence others to take action? We asked experts.Know that you can make a differenceThe first step to taking climate action is knowing that your actions matter.“I think people feel overwhelmed or like they have to be an expert to take some of this action, and you really, really don’t,” says Samantha Harrington, director of audience experience at Yale Climate Connections.Experts also encourage people not to get bogged down by perfectionism. Many are limited in what actions they can take because of economic, geographic or personal circumstances.“You’re not a bad person if you can’t afford right now to get aheat pumpinstead of using your gas furnace,” says Harrington. For instance, walking, biking or taking the bus to the grocery store rather than driving is effective. Reducing food waste, which turns into methane in a landfill, is also an approachable way to take action. “Everything you can do matters.”Resources like the Nature Conservancy’scarbon footprint calculatorcan help you identify areas in your life where you expend the most energy and think about how to make changes.Reduce, reuse, recycleOne of the most helpful refrains in environmental conservation is the classic “reduce, reuse, recycle”.“That’s a hierarchy,” explains Hoover; reducing one’s consumption is the most important, followed by reusing goods, and then recycling them.Extending the life of products and buying items that are well made and longer-lasting can go a long way to reducing the amount of waste one produces, Hoover says. And when it comes time to get rid of an item, try to donate it or recycle it so it doesn’t end up in a landfill.“If there’s anything in your life that is designed to be used once and then thrown away, think about if there’s an alternative to that thing,” adds Hoover. For example, plastic water bottles can be replaced with reusable water bottles, and single-use cutlery can be avoided if one travels with reusable cutlery.Check where your money is goingReflect on what products, services and companies you have been supporting with your money, and what their impact is on the planet. Fast fashion, for example, is an environmental disaster – tons and tons of cheap clothes clog uplandfillsandbeaches, and plastic from synthetic fabrics drains intowaterways.Buying higher-quality clothes that will last longer or shopping secondhand can reduce this kind of waste, says Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist for the Nature Conservancy.“My resolution last year was that I decided to buy as much clothing as I could secondhand,” says Hayhoe. “I love them! They are so affordable and so unique.”Also look closely at any investments you may have. Harrington suggests checking what your 401(k) or other funds are invested in and what financial institutions you bank with. “A lot of banks support and finance fossil fuel projects,” she says. If you are able, you might consider shifting your money intoenvironmentally sustainable funds.Look at what you’re eatingIt is no secret that food production has a huge impact on the environment. According to theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, agriculture accounts for 23% of greenhouse gas emissions. Of this, nearly 60% comes frommeat productionalone. What’s more, much of the food that gets produced is wasted.“We may be wasting as much as 40% of the food supply in this country,” says Hoover. “That has a tremendous impact. That means an associated amount of those resources that go into food production are also wasted.”This doesn’t mean everyone needs to immediately become vegan, experts say. While it’s true that meat has an extremely high resource impact on the environment, ultimately the most sustainable way to eat is the way that is sustainable to you.“Say you go cold turkey vegan for a couple of weeks, and then you decide you can’t do it any more and you quit,” says Hayhoe. “It would be better to say, I’m going to do meatless Mondays, or I’m going to incorporate two vegan recipes into my regular rota of recipes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Experts refer to this energy sapping as “vampire loads”, which can be “very substantial” in terms of one’s energy output, LeBlanc says.“So just unplug things,” says LeBlanc. She doesn’t unplug, say, her toaster every time she leaves the house, she admits. But before long trips, she unplugs all the devices in her kitchen.Be efficientOne of the key tenets of sustainability is efficiency – the less efficient you are, the more energy you are likely to use.“If you are running errands and need to use your car, plan ahead so you can combine multiple small errands into one trip,” says Hoover.And when you use your car, you can help it run more efficiently by ensuring your tire pressure is at the correct level, says LeBlanc. “With the right tire pressure, your car can move more efficiently and burn less gasoline,” she says.And consider how much you’re flying. Air travel is a majorsourceof carbon emissions. Some travel is obviously necessary, like trips for work or to see family. But think of ways to cut back. Can you do multiple events in one trip? Does a meeting really need to be in person, or can it be virtual? Can you take a train or car instead?“Now, over 80% of the talks I give are virtual talks,” says Hayhoe. “And I only travel when I can bundle events into one trip to make the carbon and the time worth it.”Speak upWhile reducing one’s daily energy use is important, experts agree that far and away the most significant environmental action a person can take has nothing to do with their carbon footprint: it’s to use their voice.“The majority of people in the US are alarmed about climate change,” says Harrington. “We don’t necessarily talk about it because we think it’s more taboo than it actually is.”Talking to our family, friends and neighbors about our environmental concerns and the actions we’re taking can help motivate others to take action as well. Consider the “neighborhood effect” on solar panel use. A 2015 paper in theJournal of Economic Geographyfound that one of the strongest predictors of solar panels being installed in an area is whether another house in the neighborhood already has them. Hayhoe says she’s observed this in her own life.“We got solar panels, and within a year we saw solar panels coming into our neighborhood,” she says. “It’s about showing people what you’re doing, and making it contagious.”This can also be done at work. Ask whether meetings that require travel can be virtual instead, and if materials really need to be printed. These measures may seem small, but they can have a big effect. Hoover says that before the NRDC, she worked for an organization that worked to encourage large companies to use recycled paper. “I was surprised to see these large companies signing on, and I realized that in many cases, this was the result of one advocate at the company talking to the folks they needed to talk to,” she says.Speaking up politically, by reaching out to your local and state representatives, is also important. Studies haveshownthat Congress and congressional staffers regularlyunderestimatehow much their constituents care about climate change, because they don’t hear from their constituents about it.Finally, Hoover says one of the most significant actions we can take for the climate is to vote in local and federal elections. “Vote for the policymakers who are going to make the kind of changes that you’re looking for,” she says. “Elect officials and support policies that promote environmental protection and progress.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHow to startfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a Friday night in Cardiff and Lottie (also played by Jarman) is seeking her own form of salvation, be it through impromptu hotel Tinder hook-ups or trauma-bonding over lines of coke in nightclub toilets. As a portrait of grief and the prejudices experienced by disabled people, this is an assured and impassioned playwriting debut.View image in fullscreenDarkly adult … Mared Jarman and Paul Davies in Byth Bythoedd Amen.Photograph: Theatr Cymru/Jorge LizaldeJarman’s performance is equally fearless. Unapologetic depictions of female sexuality remain relatively rare in Welsh-language theatre, and for the play to also foreground the desires of a blind character feels innovative and overdue. Paul Davies as Lottie’s best friend Bennie – as well as a slew of additional roles – is superb. We hear much about Bennie before he eventually appears onstage, and Davies’ expressive, smiling face seems to confirm an entire loving lifetime within a single expression.Designed by Livia Jones, the traverse street scene is redolent of a child’s play mat, contrasting with the gaudy neon pink that invites Lottie on to the sticky dancefloor of the Clam Shack. Garrin Clarke’s lighting is particularly arresting in its fluid shaping of space. Rhian Blythe’s taut direction sustains a production (for Theatr Cymru) that is unafraid of leaning into a heightened theatricality, even as it veers close to camp and despite the content often being somewhat grim.The drama seeks to straddle two worlds: destructive youthful abandon and the desire for placid maturity, the provocative and the sincere, light and dark, life and death. Some of the necessary tonal shifts are more disorientating and irreconcilable than others. Frequently, the play is strongest when emulating a darkly confessional standup routine where self-deprecation is wielded as a deflective shield. Alongside the script’s flippant quips about the aftertaste of semen are vicious descriptions of assault and of brutal ableist slurs whose violence is left hanging in the air.AtSherman theatre, Cardiff, until 31 January.

Maybe her very real success in music ruled her out of a serious acting career in the eyes of some, but Faithfull for a while occupied the epicentre of the late-60s pop culture zeitgeist, for an intense flashbulb moment she found herself in the overlapping worlds of music, movies and the explodingly important world of celebrity itself.Marianne Faithfull was a towering artist, not just the muse she was painted asRead moreThe famous photograph of her in 1967 on a couch betweenAlain Delonand Mick Jagger absolutely captures her magnetism: Delon is entranced by her, Jagger (her boyfriend) is jealous, looking grumpily down: she and Delon were starring together in The Girl on a Motorcycle by the British cinematographer and director Jack Cardiff in which she was the super-sexy rock chick in a leather body suit whose zipper Delon would lasciviously pull down with his teeth.View image in fullscreenFaithfull in The Girl on a Motorcycle.Photograph: Ares Production/AllstarAround the same time,Jean-Luc Godardgave her a prominent cameo in his archly anti-American Made in USA, singing her chart-topping single As Tears Go By in a cafe, a song that mysteriously becomes the soundtrack to the main characters’ tensions and discontents. Godard homed in on her brand identity as a muse for the modishly rebellious Britrock invasion of America and the world – but Godard favoured her as a follower of the bad-boy Stones, not the goody-two-shoes Beatles. She had also appeared in the trendspotting comedy I’ll Never Forget What’s’isname, from director Michael Winner about that most fashionable of figures: an ad man. She was the enigmatic goddess Lilith in Kenneth Anger’s experimentalLucifer Rising.Marianne Faithfull – a life in picturesRead moreThese were not films that made great demands on Faithfull’s acting skills, although she certainly had them, as could be seen in Tony Richardson’s filmed version of his stage production of Hamlet, in which Faithfull was a poignantly frail Ophelia opposite Nicol Williamson’s prince and Anthony Hopkins’ king – singing beautifully.View image in fullscreenOliver Reed and Faithfull in I’ll Never Forget What’s’isname.Photograph: Universal/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockBut perhaps it was her destiny in later years (like Pallenberg) to get small parts, some in productions where her presence facilitated financial backing. She was briefly in a 1974 mystery horror called Ghost Story, with Vivian MacKerrell, who inspired the figure of Withnail inWithnail and I. She was briefly in the 90s crime drama Shopping and in Patrice Chéreau’s Intimacy.View image in fullscreenFaithfull in Irina Palm.Photograph: Strand Rel./AllstarBut a lot of the time it was a question of affectionately and respectfully intended iconic cameos, intended at some level to conjure up the authority of that 60s buzz: Gus Van Sant put her in his short Le Marais in 2006 as part of the Paris, Je T’Aime anthology and the same yearSofia Coppolamade her the Empress Maria Theresa, mother of Kirsten Dunst’sMarie Antoinettein her film of that name.But she was also prominent (unfortunately) in that somewhat bizarre British movieIrina Palmfrom 2008 in which she plays an older woman who turns to sex work to pay for her grandson’s operation, taking advantage of her silky palms – giving hand relief via glory holes in a sex clubs to men who never see her. It was a film that briefly gave rise to a prize called theIrina Palm d’Orfor the most entirely unsatisfactory British film.Perhaps Faithfull is a figure from music and pop culture from the lost swinging age rather than cinema, but without the movies she would not have been so potent.Explore more on these topicsFilmMarianne FaithfullAlain DelonJean-Luc GodardMichael  WinnerSofia CoppolaGus Van SantcommentShareReuse this content"

But giving them a real stake in it could change everythingThu 30 Jan 2025 11.12 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 12.20 ESTShareFor God’s sake don’t give them the vote! Many people said that after a shocking poll published this week appeared to show young people rejecting democracy. But that’s utterly wrong. On the contrary, this should promptLabourto accelerate its manifesto pledge to give 16- and 17-year-olds the vote. They need more democracy, not less, and soon.The Channel 4 poll found that52% of 13- to 27-year-oldsthink “the UK would be a better place if a strong leader” were in change “who does not have to bother with parliament and elections”, and 33% thought the country would be better run “if the army was in charge”, among other dark impulses.I have doubts about the value of springing kneejerk, contextless questions on people. (Does anyone want a “weak” leader? Was there a follow-up question: “Do you want the right to get rid of a leader you hate?”) Psephologist Peter Kellner reckons “it’s more a top-of-the-head response indicating a general sense of pessimism, disillusionment and disengagement than a thought-out view of how society should be organised”. It’s a spasm, much likePeter Finch in the film Networkleaning out of the TV studio window and shouting: “I’m mad as hell and I’m not gonna take this any more!”But some working knowledge of politics matters.Citizenship educationflowered briefly when David Blunkett as education secretary made it compulsory in England, with specialist teachers. But it was killed off byMichael Gove dropping itfrom his Ebacc, along with bursaries for teachers training in it. Officially, it’s still compulsory for state-maintained schools – academies are not curriculum-bound – but it’s often absent, left to form tutors, untimetabled. Ofsted barely checks, and what’s not inspected gets ignored.Five times fewer pupils take the GCSE than 15 years ago, according to Liz Moorse, chief executive of the Association for Citizenship Teaching.This latest poll should spur the national curriculum review to restore it, when it reports in March. Forget memories of grim “civics” lessons, citizenship is nothing like that. At Priory school in Southsea, Hampshire, headteacher Stewart Vaughan and his specialist citizenship teacher Helen Blatchford promote it enthusiastically, not just to study but as democratic practice running right through the school, with a school council, consultations on the curriculum and priorities for spending capital. Students there “know they are heard”, says the head, even if they don’t get the final say. Blatchford has submitted her evidence to the curriculum review about the good effect of citizenship education on the whole school.Critical thinking is its core, which means learning about problem-solving, weighing evidence, making arguments and learning how to agree and disagree. Students run mock elections and take practical collective action with local councillors and voluntary groups. Teaching media literacy, debunking myths and identifying reliable online sources is not easy, says Vaughan. “They are overwhelmed 24 hours a day by a volume of online material: we can’t keep up. We only hope to equip them to filter unreliable sources, but schools can’t do this alone. It needs families, and government regulation of these sites.”Difficult subjects are not ducked. Gaza arouses strong passions, so they discuss Middle Eastern history, conflict and identity, Vaughan says, “with impartiality, listening to students’ stories. They are opinionated, but respectful of arguments.” Where better to debate Andrew Tate’s misogyny? Forty of the school’s year 10s choose citizenship for GCSE. Plentiful studies showgood effects rippling through schoolsthat teach it seriously.Voting at 16 and 17 would affect schools and teenagers profoundly. Politicians eagerly pressing the flesh in care homes would turn to schools and colleges with equal solicitude for the young. In Scotland and other countries where 16-year-olds vote, Dr Christine Huebner of Sheffield University finds, they vote more than the 18-24s – perhaps because they live at home and are encouraged by their schools. But once 18-year-olds leave for colleges and universities elsewhere, registration plummets – their lives are disrupted and they move frequently, “with crucial NI numbers often left at home”. Huebner wonders if that’s exactly what David Cameron intended whenhe banned colleges and universitiesfrom registering all students: young votes “fell off a cliff” with hisindividual voter registrationfrom the 2015 election, she says.Voter ID rulespassed by the Tories in 2022, another anti-youth gerrymander, allowed pensioners’ travel passes for identity but not young people’s travel cards.No, the kids are really not all right. Honestly, can you blame them? | Marina HydeRead moreThe ability of schools, universities and colleges to register students needs to be restored, alongside automatic voter registration, to stemfalling turnout. Here’s why voting at 16 is crucial: if someone votes once, it’slikely to become a lifelong habit. Many of the never-voted secretly fear getting it wrong at the polling station because their literacy or English is poor, covering it with a bluff: “They’re all the same!” But if every pupil were taken to the school’s local polling station by a teacher and everything explained (including the option to spoil their ballot), that habit would start right there. I would make the quid pro quo for votes at 16 a compulsion to vote that first time, but good citizenship education might make that unnecessary. Electronic voting is essential – and again, barred by the Tories to deter the young.There are too few 16- and 17-year-olds in any constituency to significantly shift the dial, even if they all voted for the same candidate (and they are as diverse as other age groups, says Huebner). But would George Osborne’s austerity have targeted their educational maintenance allowances and their housing benefits, or closed youth centres, if MPs were soliciting their votes?Generation Z has grown up since the 2008 crash and knows only stagnation, dwindling life chances and vanishing home ownership, so no wonder47% of them told the Channel 4 pollthat “the entire way our society is organised must be radically changed through revolution”. Citizenship education makes them more tolerant and more supportive of democracy and increases their intentions to vote, but it won’t assuage that indignation. It should channel justified anger into political action to force Westminster’s attention.The government says votes at 16 will definitely be law “in good time ahead of the next general election”: speed it up. If anyone thinks young people are too stupid, just spend a day out canvassing.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionElectoral reformLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Why?Robert ReichThese new initiatives are not about shrinking the size of the federal government. They’re about centralizing control in Trump’s handsThu 30 Jan 2025 06.30 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 12.29 ESTShareChaos on a huge scale.On Wednesday, Trump rescinded an order he had made late on Monday night that froze up to $3tn in federal grants and loans.That Monday-night order had caused wild confusion across America.Hospitals, schools, non-profits, research organizations, pre-school programs and police departments wondered if they lost federal financial support.The Medicaid system that provides healthcare to millions of low-income Americans was interrupted.By Tuesday afternoon, a federal judge had temporarily blocked the order in response to lawsuits claiming that Trump had no authority to freeze funds allocated by Congress.Attorneys general in 22 states and the District of Columbia, all of them Democrats, had joined together to stop the order.So, on Wednesday, in the midst of this chaos, Trump’s acting director of the office of management and budget (OMB), Matthew J Vaeth, notified federal agencies that the Monday-night order had been “rescinded”.What are we to make of this?The scale of Trump’s Monday-night order was wildly broad. It argued that federal spending must be aligned with “presidential priorities” while reviews are undertaken and gave officials until 10 February to report to the OMB.By then, the OMB will likely be run by Russ Vought, Trump’s nominee – and, not incidentally, the chief author of Project 2025, the blueprint for Trump’s takeover of the US government.My betting is we’ll see another version of Monday night’s order emerge once Vought is installed. It will be somewhat more detailed to avoid the confusion of the first attempt. But the Trump White House views the order as essential. It’s part of a much larger plan.Last week, in a separate initiative, Trump barred certain spending he disagreed with, including programs involving “diversity, equity and inclusion” and non-government organizations he believes undermine the national interest.He also ordered a 90-day freeze on all foreign aid spending, which has jeopardized congressionally authorized foreign assistance, including military aid to Ukraine and the distribution of medications in Africa and developing nations.All of this is illegal.Under the US constitution, Congress holds the power of the purse, and Congressapproved– that is, “appropriated” – all these payments.Trump’s attempted takeover of the US government is part of a larger strategy to replace democracy with an oligarchyTrump, like any president, has the power to pause previously appropriated spending to review it, but Trump’s freezes are not really about pausing. They’re aboutstopping. That’s called “impounding”.In 1974, Congress enacted theImpoundment Control Actin response to Richard Nixon’s attempts to not spend funds Congress had appropriated. The act prohibits a president from doing this.Trump believes the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional. But the supreme court determines what acts of Congress are not constitutional. In the 1975 case ofTrain v City of New York,the supreme courtunanimouslyupheld the constitutionality of the act.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Otherwise, they risk being furloughed – that is, not being paid – or fired.The likely author of this memo isElon Musk, the richest person in the world, whom Trump tapped to become head of the so-called “department of government efficiency”.When Musk fired 80% of Twitter’s employees on taking over the firm in 2022, he used the same language that headed this week’s memo to federal employees: “A fork in the road.”But make no mistake.

But what if it had done so sooner?Royal Mail should cut second-class delivery days, says regulator OfcomThu 30 Jan 2025 13.25 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 14.06 ESTShareWhat if Ofcom had cutRoyal Mailsome slack half a decade ago? What if the universal service obligation (USO), the requirement on the postal operator to deliver nationwide six days a week at a uniform price, had been tweaked before letter volumes fully fell off the cliff?Would Royal Mail’s finances have been in better shape? Would Daniel Křetínský, AKAthe Czech Sphinx, not have had an opening to make his £3.6bn takeover bid while the share price was on the floor? Or, if he had pounced, would the board of the International Distribution Services(IDS), the parent, have put up a stiffer fight?We’ll never know, and it’s too late to revisit the takeover tale because Křetínský’s EP Group will be in charge by the spring once the last regulatory boxes are ticked. But one can still wonder how events might have played out differently if Ofcom had got its act together earlier. That is because two features stand out in Thursday’s final proposal. First,the changes are modest. Second, they should still make a big difference to Royal Mail’s profitability.On the former, Royal Mail will be allowed to deliver second-class letters on alternate weekdays and not on Saturdays. First-class letters will continue six days a week, albeit with a minor adjustment (the target for next-day delivery has been downgraded from 93% to 90%, but there’s a new “tail of mail” clause to require 99.5% by the third day). Royal Mail still has to meet the new standards, but the rejigged USO itself is unlikely to provoke uproar across the country. AsOfcomsays, most customers now value reliability over speed of delivery.But then look at the projected annual savings for Royal Mail under the new setup: between £250m and £425m, reckons the regulator, or £300m, thinks the company. Either way, we’re not talking loose change. For the first time since 2015/16, Royal Mail should be able to achieve the 5% profit margin in its “reported business” (the one that provides the USO) that Ofcom has always regarded as a fair indication of sustainability.That is one reason why it was so infuriating that IDS’s board pleaded “significant uncertainty” around reform last May when itrolled over to Křetínský. It was obvious even then that something like Thursday’s proposal was coming – the consultation had opened in January and the winds had shifted.But one can also sympathise with the IDS board’s longer-standing fury that it had to wait so long for Ofcom (or the government) to move. The need for some form of regulatory relief should have been obvious as early as 2020. Letter volumes had already halved to 10bn, andthe regulator’s formal “users’ needs” surveyof that year found that 97% of customers said they’d be happy with a five-day-a-week letter service. Yet nothing happened.None of which is to deny that Royal Mail’s own actions contributed to its persistently poor financial numbers. But its management’s constant pleas for a helping hand were justified. Other European countries had already watered down their USO equivalents and the UK network was built to handle volumes of 20bn a year. Now we’re down to 6.6bn and going lower.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he’s wrong to say it’s ‘culture’ preventing other dads doing the sameThu 30 Jan 2025 07.41 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 12.25 ESTShareThe start of a pregnancy is always a time of some uncertainty, but when my partner and I learned we were expecting our second child last year I was faced with a question I hadn’t experienced with our first: would I be able to take any paternity leave? The nature of my work involves working contract-to-contract and I was due to start at a new organisation within days. Britain’scurrent paternity leave system, fundamentally unchanged since it was implemented in 2003, only entitles fathers or other co-parents to leave if they have been with the same employer since the pregnancy began.The exclusionary nature of paternity leave in the UK has felt like a long-neglected issue in our politics, leading to the emergence of new campaigns such asthe Dad Shift. So the news that the Scottish secretary, Ian Murray, will bethe first cabinet minister to take full paternity leave– a decision signed off by the prime minister – is a welcome and overdue indication that the people running our country at least have some understanding of the realities facing new parents today.It is clear that Murray has an admirable commitment to fathers playing an active role in raising their children, as demonstrated by his decision to release the news publicly. But, given this, it was disappointing to see him state in his announcement that “the biggest impediment to paternity leave is culture” and that “from a wider policy perspective, I think it’s really important for dads to know they can take it” – claims that suggest the government hasn’t fully grasped the challenges fathers and other co-parents face.Although Murray is right to challenge any cultural issues that prevent fathers taking paternity leave,the evidence is clearthat the overwhelming majority of fathers want to take leave, but too many face barriers rooted in the outdated and dysfunctional policies available to them. As well as it being limited by length of employment, the UK offersthe lowest paid paternity leave in Europe, with a duration far below the12.7 week averageamong Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.It is unsurprising, then, thatpolling commissioned by the Trades Union Congress(TUC) has found that the most common reason for parents not taking paternity leave was financial pressure. Uptake of paternity leave is lowest among households with smaller incomes, while less than a third of self-employed co-parents – who have no entitlement to paternity leave – take any time off at all, compared to 79% overall. Similarly,research conducted by the charity Pregnant Then Screwedfound that one in five new fathers had no leave options available to them and 62% of second parents would have taken more leave if statutory paternity pay were higher. Cultural barriers to taking leave predominantly rested with employers, with both surveys finding that many fathers felt pressured to curtail their leave or continue working during it.I am very fortunate that my employer is allowing me to take leave, despite my not being eligible for statutory pay, but the pressures of my contract ending later in the year means it will be shorter than I would like. I am also ineligible to take any shared parental leave when my partner returns to work, denying me the opportunity that I had with my eldest child to spend an extended period of time together one-on-one, strengthening our relationship and my confidence as a caregiver. Shared parental leave was introduced to enable fathers to take longer periods of leave but has manifestly failed, withan uptake of only 5%among new co-parents. It has many of the same barriers posed by statutory paternity leave, such as a lack of eligibility and low pay, as well as any leave being taken away from the mother’s allowance, rather than being exclusively for the co-parent.Academicresearch has shownthat the countries that are most successful at encouraging fathers to take leave offer them extended periods of protected time – which they have to “use or lose” – combined with a high level of pay.Although the UK government is currently legislating to make paternity leave a “day one” right in Britain, it does not plan to alter the length of time or pay available to new co-parents, meaning the new policy is likely to have a limited impact on uptake. It would also not help the many self-employed fathers who, unlike mothers, do not have any right to statutory pay.There are promising signs beyond Murray’s announcement that the government may make some of the changes needed to enable more fathers to take time off when their children are born.Labour’s manifestopromised a review of parental leave within its first year of office and the MP Stella Creasy hasproposed an amendmentto the employment rights bill, supported by many of her colleagues, calling for protected paternity or parental partner for all employees. But to make a real difference, they need to go further: extend statutory paternity pay to self-employed fathers; offer a longer period of leave, exclusively for co-parents; and accompanying this with an increase in pay available, at the very least for those on lower incomes who receive the least support right now.As I approach my second experience of paternity leave, I can only hope the government builds on its warm words and makes the necessary reforms to ensure no other fathers face anxiety or obstacles to spending time with their newborn children.Tommer Spence is a researcher and freelance writerExplore more on these topicsMaternity & paternity rightsOpinionParents and parentingIan MurrayFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

It is failingNathalie TocciThere are rational explanations for the continent’s muted response to Donald Trump’s threats – but that’s not how you deal with this presidentThu 30 Jan 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 12.42 ESTShareDonald Trump’s antics over the past week have put paid to the refrain, often heard in Europe, that the president should be taken “seriously but not literally”. It turns out that Trump literally wants Greenland. He doubled down on his aggressive rhetoric in araging 45-minute callwith the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, a few days ago, threatening crippling tariffs unless she agreed to sell the autonomous territory to the US. In response to Denmark’s sharp increase in military spending for the Arctic, including ships and drones, he derided Copenhagen’s “dog-sled” defences for Greenland, the world’s largest non-continental island, which pale in comparison with the strength of the US military base there.The threat to take over the territory of a European country by force is something that Europeans now know all too well. Russia has repeatedly threatened east European countries, making good on those threats by invading Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine since 2014. Yet many Europeans are gobsmacked that such a threat is now coming from its greatest ally.Forget it, Trump: Greenland doesn’t want to be ruled by the US – or Denmark | Aka HansenRead moreThat said, the reaction has been muted. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the European Council president, António Costa, have said nothing, while the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, while speaking out initially, have joined in the collective silence. What’s going on?There are several rational explanations. Against the backdrop of great power rivalry and the climate crisis, which is opening seaways in the melting Arctic, Washington’s appetite for resource-rich Greenland is growing. At the same time, the relationship between Copenhagen and Nuuk (Greenland’s capital) is complex, with the latter now pushing for independence. Although results from a recent survey published in the Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq and the Danish Berlingske reveal that 85% of Greenlandersdo not wantto join the US, Denmark fears that if its reactions to Trump’s territorial designs are too vocal, it could alienate Greenlanders and push the island further into the US orbit. Tread carefully are the watchwords coming from Copenhagen to its European partners.View image in fullscreenThe Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, after their meeting in Berlin, 28 January 2025.Photograph: Maja Hitij/Getty ImagesAnd European leaders are heeding the call. Both the public silence and behind-the-scenes work appear to be coordinated, with Frederiksen meeting with the leaders of Norway, Sweden and Finland, as well as Germany, France and Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, in recent days. Cooperation between the EU andGreenlandis also intensifying on issues such as energy and critical raw materials. The upfront explanation for Europe’s silence on Greenland is, therefore, that it is a deliberate, coordinated tactic not to feed the beast of transatlantic escalation, giving space for officials to quietly mitigate and defuse the threat.An equally rational, though less edifying, explanation is that Europeans have bigger fish to fry with Washington. They need to make sure Trump remains engaged on the question of European military security, starting with Ukraine, and they want to dissuade the US president from unleashing a trade war. European silence on Greenland is, therefore, also a question of priorities; the last thing Europeans want is to antagonise the man such that he pulls the plug on Nato. Countries in northern and eastern Europe that would be hurt most by US disengagement from Ukraine, as well as western and southern European countries that would be most exposed to a transatlantic trade war, will be thinking that it’s not worth making too much of a fuss about Greenland.But these rational explanations only go so far, and don’t take into account the potentially high costs of inaction – such as undermining the notion of European political solidarity.Danish PM says Europe must ‘stand together’ as Trump threatens GreenlandRead moreInstead of reason, it might be worth thinking about emotions. Two contrasting ones are mutually reinforcing. Europeans are scared. They fear Trump and their fear is paralysing. It freezes their actions and quiets their rhetoric. The more Trump confirms their fears through his repeated threats, the less they are inclined to react. Trump presumably smells the fear, and like all bullies revels in it, upping the ante.Yet Europeans also paradoxically feel insufficiently anxious. They cling to the conviction that the storm will pass. Waiting translates into silence, a complacent wish that Trump’s threat to Europe will wither away or that his attention will inevitably turn elsewhere. Insufficient anxiety means that Europe lacks the adrenaline to act.In other words, faced with yet another serious crisis, Europe – through a combination of reason and fear – is deciding to just muddle through. But convincing ourselves that everything will be all right is precisely what prevents the radical renewal that the continent badly needs. And a mere week into Trump’s presidency, a vital question looms: if a US president threatening an EU member state doesn’t jolt Europe out of its complacent slumber, then what will?Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistExplore more on these topicsGreenlandOpinionDonald TrumpDenmarkEuropean UnionEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

After 14 years of environmental vandalism, it might have seemed impossible forLabourto offer anything but improvement. But on green issues, this government is worse than the Tories.The last prime minister to insist that growth should override every other consideration, and to fling insults atanyone who disagreed, was Liz Truss. She called those of us seeking to defend the living world an “anti-growth coalition”, “voices of decline” and “enemies of enterprise” who “don’t understand aspiration”.Now Keir Starmer has picked up her theme and run with it. Those who challengegovernment policiesthat might promote GDP growth, however destructive and irrational, such as the planned expansion of Heathrow, Gatwick, Luton and Doncaster Sheffieldairports, are “time-wasting nimbys”, “zealots” and“blockers”, engaged in “self-righteous virtue-signalling”.After all, these are the kind of people who might send “congratulations to the climate campaigners” whose legal challenge stopped plans to build a third Heathrow runway at the court of appeal. Or who insist that Heathrow expansion should be blocked because “there is no more important challenge than the climate emergency”. Oh, hang on, that was Starmer, writing in 2020. You know, the one you voted for, not the new model, channelling the worst Tory prime minister of modern times.Now his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, insists that growth “trumps other things”, including the government’senvironmental commitments. The verb is unfortunate. The government’s new rhetoric is horribly reminiscent of the convicted felon: monomania, slogans and insults take the place of nuanced and complex policy.It makes sense to improve east-west rail links and construct more reservoirs and offshore windfarms, as Reeves promisedin her speech, and we urgently need new, genuinely affordable housing (alongsidesystemic change in the housing market). But there’s no justification in a climate emergency for airport expansion or new trunk roads, such as her Lower Thames Crossing. The “sustainable aviation fuels” the government plans to rely ondon’t exist, and won’t materialise at scale.Reevesmocks environmental concernin true Trumpian fashion, claiming that people object to schemes like the third runway she has just announced at Heathrowbecause they “might add something to carbon emissions in 20 years’ time”. There’s no “might” about it. They will. But who cares what happens in 20 years? It won’t be her problem.Of course, this also means that such projects won’t deliver growth for 20 years, either. In fact, some evidence suggests that airport expansiondoesn’t deliver growthat all. But even if it did, and the growth were used to fund new hospitals (a big if), we’d have to wait 20 or more years for that dividend. Is this really the policy?View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves delivers a speech on economic growth at Siemens Healthineers in Eynsham, Oxfordshire, 29 January 2025.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesAn alternative would be to build hospitals now. As they are huge employers and help people return to work, they would appear more likely than airports to generate growth, as well as meeting our urgent needs. But a full hospital building plan is now aless urgent priorityfor the government than airport expansion. This contributes to the impression that, like Truss, when Reeves and Starmer say “growth”, what they really mean is meeting the demands of predatory lobbyists.But let’s for a moment take them at their word. Let’s imagine that economic growth should be treated as the overriding national purpose. Let’s ignore the economist who standardised GDP, Simon Kuznets, who advised that “the welfare of a nation canscarcely be inferredfrom a measure of national income”. If this is the agenda, Starmer and Reeves should read a report published earlier this month, not by Extinction Rebellion, but by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. It warns that without immediate and decisive action, climate breakdown couldreduce the size of the global economyby 50% between 2070 and 2090.In other words, if Heathrow’s third runway is built, by 2040 it might or might not contribute a tiny increment to GDP. But it would, if the warning is correct, contribute to a comprehensive economic collapse shortly afterwards. Starmer accuses objectors to such schemes of having “slowed down our progress as a nation”. But when that “progress” is a demented rush towards the precipice, perhaps a slowing down – and achange in priorities– would serve us well.But no – everything must be sacrificed to the god of GDP. For example, though chicken factories (huge steel sheds containing tens of thousands of birds) arekilling the Wyeand many other rivers, Steve Reed, the environment secretary, insists that planning permission for themshould become easierto obtain. Planning is the only effective point of intervention: once the factories are built, the nitrates and phosphates they produce inevitablywrecknearby rivers. They are also likely to kill far more economic value than they create, as they ravage local economies built on tourism and block more benign developments as a result ofnutrient overload. In this and other respects, thegovernment is pre-emptingits ownwater commission, which some of us see as one of thefew signs of environmental progresssince the Conservatives.Last week, in a spectacular act of despoliation, Starmersank the climate and nature bill, whose purpose was to bring government policy into line with its international commitments. Labour ordered its MPs totalk the bill out of time, and threatened to withdraw the whip from those who supported it.Rachel Reeves tells MPs of plans to go ‘further and faster’ in pursuit of growthRead moreThe government’s attack on regulators goes even further than Truss’s. Asbodies such as the Environment Agency, Natural England, theHealth and Safety Executiveand thechemicals agency UK Reachcrumple through a lethal combination of underbudgeting and political hostility, Reeves insists that the job of regulators is to “drive growth”. But that is not their role. They exist to protect us, regardless of the demands of capital. After 15 years of deregulation through budget cuts and ministerial nudges, the results include thedeath of our rivers, thedegradation of our soil, acatastrophic loss of wildlife,air pollutionand noise exceeding safe levels, and atoxic loadwhose impacts on human health we can only begin to guess at. How does any of this improve our lives?But never mind, let’s melt human life and the natural world down into money. GDP, a number whichincorporates great harmsas well as benefits, must trump all else. Then the government will have some numbers to boast about, even if they represent a decline in our wellbeing – our genuine prosperity.These people may be more competent than Truss, but after just six months in power they have become as terrifying in their cold fanaticism and intolerance of dissent.

Commercial and military aircraft are on the move there at all times. The greatest concentration is aroundReagan National airport, the city’s principal domestic hub, which sits on the west bank of the Potomac River within sight of the Capitol dome.No one yet knows how a Black Hawk military helicoptercollidedwith an American Eagle flight from Wichita above the Potomac on Wednesday evening. But the destruction was total. No survivors have been found from among the 64 people on board the flight from Kansas or among the three-strong crew of the helicopter.By early Thursday, the rescue effort was already a recovery operation. Bodies were being lifted from the river’s icy waters through the day.Mass-fatality airplanecrashesare mercifully rare. The last one in the US wasin 2009. But a crash in such a sensitive location, where aircraft congestion has been an ongoing controversy, will always attract unusual attention. It was also all too probable that the human tragedy would become a pawn in the jarring politics of the second Donald Trump administration, which has already turned its vengeful beam on theFederal Aviation Administration(FAA), which regulates civil aviation, airports and air traffic control systems.That probability duly became a certainty within hours of Wednesday’s disaster, when Mr Trump posted his own provocative version of the questions he believes are posed by the crash. “Why didn’t the helicopter go up or down, or turn?” he asked. “Why didn’t the control tower tell the helicopter what to do instead of asking if they saw the plane?” The crash “looks like it should have been prevented. NOT GOOD!!!”By any normal standards, this would have been an extraordinary intervention. But this is a president who, in his first week in the White House, had already picked an inflammatory fight with the FAA over safety. Last week,in an executive order, he ordered it to end the diversity, equity and inclusion rules in its hiring policy. He also ordered the agency to review the performance and standards of all FAA employees in “critical safety positions”. Tasteless and inappropriate though it is, Mr Trump’s post signals his readiness – which he did nothing at all to dispel in Thursday’s press conference – to blame the FAA for the Potomac tragedy.But it may also highlight a certain vulnerability. There is no direct connection between Mr Trump’s determination to slash the federal workforce, truncating its regulatory functions, and this week’s midair crash. But his ambitious assault on the role and power of government, conducted behind a smokescreen of anti-diversity propaganda, sits uneasily alongside tendentious attacks on a trusted air traffic control system on which the public has just been forcefully reminded that it depends.If so, it may align with other signs that Mr Trump’s administration will not have things quite its own way. This week, the president tried tofreezeall government grants and loans, putting at risk programmes ranging from disaster relief to cancer research. The move caused chaos for claimants and employees. But a judge has now stayed that effort, and Republican lawmakers are facing a politicalbacklash. It would be some consolation if this terrible loss of life, underscoring the uncompromisable importance of public safety, prompted a similar public and political reaction against Mr Trump’s shameless attempt to wreck the FAA.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

MPs’ horror at sexual exploitation gangs is sincere, but attempting to bolt a public inquiry on to Bridget Phillipson’s bill was an ill-judged attemptto sour the moodaround an important piece of progressive legislation. That amendment was defeated. But ministers were rattled when Kemi Badenoch echoedcomplaints by academy leadersthat the bill will cramp their style. Wording was altered so that they will not, after all, be obliged to pay teachers in accordance with nationally agreed pay scales.Ministers should now draw a line and stand their ground.The shortageof teachers in key subjects is a problem that got worse under the Conservatives. It is questionable whether tighter pay rules would have caused the harm claimed, and Sir Keir Starmer was right to stress that there is nothing remarkable about requiring teachers in all schools to be qualified. Mrs Badenoch’s jibe – are Olympians not qualified to teach PE? – was a rhetorical flourish, not a serious point.Measures promoting cooperation and reducing fragmentation across the system are welcome and consistent with Labour values. It is right to give local authorities more say over admissions in their area, particularly given theimmense challenge of special needs provision, and to oblige academies to follow the same curriculum as other schools. While it suits Mrs Badenoch’s Conservatives to pose as the champions of academy freedoms, evidence for academisation as a route to higher standards is non-existent, as they well know. Some studies have found thatlocal authority schools outperform them. This is why plans to turn all schools into academies have several times been floated and abandoned.The new “fit and proper” test for people wishing to run private schools ought to have been in place years ago. The public may be startled to learn that it wasn’t. More clarity is needed regardingOfsted’s future, and how this relates to the role of new regional improvement teams. But replacing one-word judgments with more nuanced report cards is the right move, and should go some way towards restoring the sector’s morale.Parts of the bill addressed to children’s lives outside school are even more urgently needed. New tools to help agencies keep track of vulnerable pupils are a positive step. This column has argued before in favour of acompulsory registerfor home-schooled children – who now number 153,000. It is scandalous that parents have, until now, been able to choose to home educate children about whom there are documented child protection concerns.New regulations for private children’s homes do not go far enough.Capping provider profitsshould not be a “last resort”. This is a failing market that ministers should be aiming to wind up. The children’s commissioner, Rachel de Souza, has argued that the bill could also be an opportunity toremove reasonable chastisementas a defence to the charge of assaulting a child – a change that Sir Keir has previously backed.But there is a good deal to look forward to when this bill becomes law. At a time when concerns around children’s wellbeing and development are rising, school breakfast clubs will improve lives. This, in particular, is a policy to be proud of.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Illnesses are ‘physical’, or they are ‘mental’.”Samuel Taylor Coleridge coined the term “psychosomatic” in the late 18th century to describe bodymind conditions, while the term “placebo” was first used in the same period, referencing a link between imagination and physical symptom. A few years later, in 1800, the physician John Haygarth published the widely read pamphlet Of the Imagination As a Cause and a Cure of Disorders of the Body.Franz Anton Mesmer (a friend of Haydn and Mozart) had infamously “treated” so-called hysteria (a term invented by Hippocrates in the 5th century BC to describe a psychological condition noted in women, spuriously thought to be caused by a “restless womb”) with a combination of music-induced relaxation augmented by hypnotic suggestion and a questionable use of magnets passed over the body. This concentrated on what would come to be known as “erogenous zones”.Mesmer’s work with “animal magnetism” was discredited, but nevertheless influenced the neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, who – in the late 19th century – treated so-called hysterics at the Salpêtrière hospital in Paris through induction of hypnotic trance and suggestion.During the winter of 1885-86, Sigmund Freud attended Charcot’s theatrical demonstrations of psychosomatic treatment of women patients, where his idea of a deep relationship between body and mind – as a symptom linked to repression – was formed. Drawing on Suzannah Jones’s work arguing that, in comparison with men, women are airbrushed from history, we might note that historically the “psychosomatic” in medicine is largely gendered as “women’s issues”. Or the rest is “hystery”.Alan BleakleyEmeritus professor of medical humanities, Plymouth Peninsula School of MedicineAida Edemariam’s article is magnificent. I have been waiting for it for years. I can say that I have been talking about monism all my career. The damage Descartes dealt us reached very far, even into the phraseology we use, not only when we talk about illness. As a consultant psychiatrist, I regularly used to draw attention to dualism in ward rounds and meetings. “It’s physical,” colleagues would say to exclude a condition from our interest, to which I would retort: “Everything is physical.” I also noticed that many patients with anxiety and obsessional disorder, as well as functional disorders, seemed to conceptualise their condition in the most dualistic way. They would say: “It’s not me, doctor – it’s my mind.” I maintain that the word “mind” should be treated as a verb, not as a noun. It’s an activity carried out by the brain at its highest level of functioning.Name and address suppliedThis article was a well-written summary of an understanding that I have used to hack my wiring as part of recovery fromlong Covid. Many others are doing this for conditions such as fibromyalgia (which the article mentions) and ME (or CFS – chronic fatigue syndrome).The role of the mind in illness is difficult to explain in a way that resonates with most people and is not interpreted as dismissive or as saying: “It’s all in the head.” The article does a really good job of this, and so it is a shame that illnesses including ME and long Covid are not even mentioned. Far more people suffer from long Covid today, for example, than most of the conditions mentioned in the article.While this knowledge is helping many, it could help so many more people if it were more widely understood by both medical practitioners and society in general. Those searching online using “ME” or “long Covid” will miss this piece of otherwise excellent journalism and, potentially, the understanding that can help them recover. That is the real shame.Julie BlackLaurencekirk, AberdeenshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I also note that he had received a diagnosis of autism.My son is autistic; he fits Keir Starmer’s “loners, misfits, young men in their bedroom” labelling to a T. He too has been marginalised, bullied and rarely leaves the house. He too lives his life through the internet. He too is vulnerable and influenced by what he reads there. When he was a teenager he too felt he wanted to kill someone. He was fortunate and received treatment.Axel Rudakubana had been a child asking for help. Like his parents, I have heard that phrase from mental health services too: “He’s not engaging, so we need to discharge him from our service.” Not engaging is part of the problem. Why have we not heard about the parents of this young man as they struggled to contain his disordered thinking? They are also victims in this tragedy.When I hear Keir Starmer pledging to address the “misfits” and “loners” isolated in their bedrooms, I wonder what this means. I do hope he will fund more services for autistic people in crisis. Many thanks for publishing a wider picture.Name and address suppliedKimon Roussopoulos (Letters, 23 January) is right that identifying potential knife attackers, their motivation and how to stop them is important. But reducing the domestic availability of sharp-pointed objects is also a feasible objective. The aggressive use of a knife without a pointed blade is much more difficult, and easier to defend against. How often are such implements needed in the kitchen – or elsewhere in the home or garden?Restricting these potential weapons to licensed individuals (butchers, for instance) would gradually reduce their availability. Sharp-edged but blunt-ended knives will need to be produced to replace them. The process could be speeded up by exchange schemes funded by the state.Peter LoweNewcastle upon TyneDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Part of the Dane’s problem is a lack of service, as when Christian Eriksen floated in a free-kick, the No 9 leaped, but the ball was aimed at Matthijs de Ligt, who connected weakly.View image in fullscreenDiogo Dalot celebrates after scoring the opener at National Arena.Photograph: Andreea Alexandru/APAmorim sent out a United XI containing the fringe talents of Toby Collyer, Altay Bayindir and Tyrell Malacia. When Malacia scythed down Florin Tanase he was booked, and Risto Radunovic’s set piece went close to punishing the left wing-back’s recklessness. Again, United’s powderpuff backline failed: the delivery was a diagonal Noussair Mazraoui, De Ligt and Lisandro Martínez all missed yet Mihai Popescu’s sliding volley did the same.For FCSB it was a glimpse that a famous win was possible. As they should, United retained a dash of potency, as when Højlund ran wide to turn back Martínez’s pass in behind. The striker found Mainoo but he blasted over from point-blank range.The 1,500 or so United enthusiasts who had made the trip could be happy, though, as those in white spun the ball about at a pace pleasing to Amorim. Eriksen warmed Stefan Tarnovanu’s fingers with a fierce shot, and when Steaua had possession United pressed quickly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Manchester United and Tottenham will be in a quarter withEintracht FrankfurtorLyon, depending on the draw's outcome.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But Højlund’s toothlessness was evident when a free header, near-in, from Martínez’s flighted ball did not trouble the keeper. This, or one of Mainoo’s two chances, had to be taken as United are no goal machine, and as this opening 45 minus aged, those in blue edged back as a force, pinning their visitors near their area.United’s shot count was six to Steaua’s paltry two. Their possession percentage was 69. At the interval they were in the fourth place they began the night, Rangers, two points back, the closest to stymieing the bid to avoid a playoff. To shake things up Amorim’s options were to stick or make a change – Amad Diallo’s zest and Garnacho’s directness his best options for this, being his only attackers on the bench.This was precisely what the Portuguese plumped for. Off went Malacia and Collyer, and on came the Ivorian and Argentinian. Garnacho’s first touch was to clip Tarnovanu’s left post after he latched on to a poor back pass: the speedster raced forward but, in a microcosm of a chief United ill, his radar was awry.Eriksen seemed to favour De Ligt as the far more likely to net than an actual forward. You could hardly blame him. At a second free-kick one of the two Amorim No 10s pinged the ball over from the left, it bounced on to the Dutchman, but he mirrored Mainoo, Garnacho, Eriksen and Højlund in his pale imitation of a lethal marksman.Next, Højlund offered a latest, unwanted iteration of the act when passed to inside the Steaua area: he worked the ball sharply on to his favoured left but when he shot Tarnovanu had a simple gather. Yet soon the home keeper saw Fernandes smack an attempt off the frame and when his defence half-cleared, Mainoo directed a cross from the right and Dalot slid in. It came in front of the now jubilant travelling fans, so the wing-back milked his moment.After Mainoo’s clincher United did what they struggle to do: manage the remainder of the tie professionally. Bayindir’s late save from an Alexandru Baluta rocket ensured that.PosTeamPGDPts1Lazio812192Athletic Bilbao88193Man Utd87184Tottenham Hotspur88175Eintracht Frankfurt84166Lyon88157Olympiacos86158Rangers86149Bodo/Glimt831410Anderlecht821411FCSB811412Ajax881313Real Sociedad841314Galatasaray831315Roma841216Plzen811217Ferencvaros801218FC Porto821119AZ801120Midtjylland801121Union Saint Gilloise801122PAOK821023Twente8-11024Fenerbahce8-21025Braga8-31026IF Elfsborg8-51027Hoffenheim8-3928Besiktas8-5929Maccabi Tel-Aviv8-9630Slavia Prague8-4531Malmo FF8-7532Rigas FS8-7533Ludogorets8-7434Dynamo Kiev8-13435Nice8-9336Qarabag FK8-143Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueSteaua BucharestManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

England have never done so in the tournament’s history, however, with France and Wales the only nations to host Friday night matches since the first in 2009.French rugby needs some Dupont magic to blow away clouds of scandal | Andy BullRead moreEngland overcame logistical and traffic issues to play their 2015 World Cup opener against Fiji at Twickenham on a Friday but the former chief executive Ian Ritchie flat out refused to entertain the idea during the Six Nations when organisers made similar attempts to encourage more nations to do so.Two of England’s three home matches this year kick off at 4.45pm on Saturdays – the other is on a Sunday at 3pm – and that remains the RFU’s clear preference for transport, operations, commercial and safety reasons but insiders have not ruled out Friday night fixtures at Twickenham if it suits broadcasters. Last August, Twickenham played host to a World Cup warm-up match between New Zealand and South Africa on a Friday night and attracted a crowd of more than 80,000.The existing TV deal for the Six Nations – a shared arrangement between the BBC and ITV – ends after this year’s championship. Organisers are open to a deal involving a subscription broadcaster and TNT is known to be strongly considering a bid. An arrangement that would see some of the tournament remain on free-to-air is considered a realistic possibility but it would remain to be seen whether England home matches – which are currently all shown on ITV – would go behind a paywall.Until that deal is finalised, the fixtures for next year’s championship cannot be scheduled. The suggestion is that more flexibility from all unions on kick-off times could make bidding for the TV rights more appealing to broadcasters. In June, meanwhile, the British & Irish Lions will play a warm-up match on a Friday night in Dublin against Argentina before heading to Australia.Staging Friday night matches at Twickenham would not come without hurdles, however. The RFU was forced to defend its crowd control measures after concerns were raised following the November defeat by South Africa amid fears of crushing in a car park while Twickenham rail station always reaches gridlock on match days. A key part of the RFU’s stadium masterplan, however, is to reduce reliance on Twickenham station.In October, the RFU launched a consultation project with Richmond and Hounslow councils in an effort to stage more non-rugby events at Twickenham. At present Twickenham is only able to stage three concerts a year with a limited capacity of 55,000. The union wants to increase that to 15 and at full, 82,000 capacity in an effort to compete with Wembley and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Doing so would generate significant income to go towards the planned Twickenham rebuild, which, if carried out in its entirety, would cost around £660m.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their deal for Walsh will also be widely seen as a further boost to Chelsea’s hopes of more silverware this season, as they strengthen their squad again despite being seven points clear at the top of the WSL, in their pursuit of a sixth consecutive title. Sonia Bompastor’s side are also through to the League Cup semi-finals, the fifth round of the FA Cup and the Champions League quarter-finals.The 27-year-old would be eligible to be registered for Chelsea’s Champions League squad for the knockout stages and therefore could theoretically be set for a reunion against her former side if they were to meet in the competition this season. The quarter-final draw takes place on Friday 7 February.Walsh has helped Barcelona win back-to-back Champions League titles in the past two seasons, but is believed to have told the Catalan club that she wanted to be closer to her family.Arsenal targeted Walsh last summer and she was reportedly the subject of a bid from the club, who have been heavily linked with her for several months. Her move to Chelsea will be seen as a bitter blow to Arsenal, who were also interested in Girma before her decision to join Chelsea.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Skating Club of Boston said six of its members had been on the plane, which had been bringing them back from a development camp that followed the US national figure skating championships in Wichita, Kansas.It named the skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane, both aged 16, along with Han’s mother, Jin Han, and Lane’s mother, Molly Lane. A story on Lane’s Instagram account, posted on Wednesday evening, showed the view from an aeroplane window captioned by the airport codes ICT and DCA, corresponding to the journey in question. The club also said the Russian-born ice skating coaches and former world champions Yevgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who were husband and wife, were among its members who had taken the flight.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Doug Zeghibe, the chief executive of the Skating Club where Shishkova and Naumov had been longtime coaches, said the organisation was “completely devastated and at a loss for words”. He added: “Skating is a very close and tight-knit community. These kids and their parents, they’re here at our facility in Norwood, six, sometimes seven days a week. It’s a close, tight bond. This will have long-reaching impacts for our skating community.”Zeghibe stated separately that he believed 14 members of the skating community, including those from his club, had been lost in the crash. The Russian news outlet Mash published a list of 13 skaters, many of them the children of Russian émigrés to the United States, who it said were believed to have been on the plane.Shishkova and Naumov, who were married to each other, won the world championships in pairs figure skating in 1994, also competing at two Winter Olympics. Reports suggested their son Maxim, also a skater and the US junior men’s champion in 2020, had been competing in Wichita but departed earlier in the week and was not on Flight 5342.View image in fullscreenEvgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov perform at the 1995 world figure skating championships in Birmingham.Photograph: Chris Cole/Getty ImagesThe Russian news agency Tass reported that Inna Volyanskaya, a former skater who competed for the Soviet Union and was a coach at the Washington figure skating club, was also onboard.A statement from Volyanskaya’s club, published on Instagram, read: “We are devastated to hear the news of American Eagle flight 5342. Our thoughts and prayers are with our skating family during this difficult time. More information will be posted when appropriate.”US Figure Skating, the country’s governing body for the sport, said in a statement: “We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims’ families closely in our hearts.”Tributes were quickly paid across the sporting world as news of the crash emerged. The International Skating Union said that the global skating community was “deeply shocked by the tragic accident”.“We are heartbroken to learn that figure skaters, along with their families, friends, and coaches, are understood to be among those on board,” it said. “Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this tragedy.Figure skatingis more than a sport – it’s a close-knit family – and we stand together.”ISU president Jae Youl Kim expressed his condolences in a statement, saying: “Today, the world of figure skating is heartbroken. We share our deepest, most sincere condolences with the families and friends of all those who lost their lives in this terrible crash. To lose so many members of our community in this way brings sadness beyond words.”Later Thursday, amoment of silence was observedprior to the evening session at the European figure skating championships in Tallinn, Estonia.Others from the US skating system to voice their grief included the Skating Club of Phoenix, which wrote on Instagram that it was “devastated by the tragic news of Flight 5342”. The post continued: “This is a huge loss to the figure skating world. Our hearts are broken.”View image in fullscreenEmergency response units conduct a search and rescue operation at the crash site on the Potomac river on Thursday.Photograph: Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesSeveral senior International Olympic Committee members, who were gathered in Lausanne for the hustings to choose the next IOC president, also expressed their condolences. Sebastian Coe, the World Athletics president, told reporters: “It would be remiss of me if I didn’t reflect on the awful events last night in the United States. I know there was grievous loss of life across the range, but I’m also deeply conscious there were Olympians and the families of Olympians on that desperate fight. So on behalf of the whole of World Athletics I’d say that our thoughts and prayers with all those families and friends have suffered such a grievous loss.”Another candidate for IOC president, Juan Samaranch Jnr, added: “The loss of life, of athletes and non-athletes, in the Olympic family and not in the Olympic family, puts everything into perspective. They have my sympathies and we hope for the best.”In a statement, the Kremlin indicated that Shishkova and Naumov as well as several other Russians had been on board. “There were other of our fellow citizens on board. It’s bad news today from Washington. We are sorry and send our condolences to families and friends,” the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.The American figure skater Luke Wang also wrote on social media that several skaters were on board the plane. “We pray for everyone who was on the flight from Wichita to DC. Among the passengers were skaters and coaches,” he added. “It’s absolutely heartbreaking.”Explore more on these topicsFigure skatingWashington DC plane crashRussiaUS sportsWashington DCnewsShareReuse this content"

CVC had earlier lost out to Reliance Industries Ltd, owners of Mumbai Indians, in a three-way auction for the equivalent stake in Oval Invincibles.‘We’re not gonna be woke’: Middlesex chief risks ECB wrath over new diversity rulesRead moreThe winning bid by Reliance, who are chaired by Mukesh Ambani, India’s wealthiest person, is understood to be worth about £60m, placing the overall value of the Oval Invincibles at £123m. It means the England and WalesCricketBoard (ECB) raised £100m on the first day of the process and is on course to meet its initial target of £350m. The money will be redistributed to the counties and the grassroots game.London Spirit has been valued by those involved in the process at about £150m, which would bring in another £75m for theECB, while the Manchester Originals’ valuation is forecast to be close to £100m. The London Spirit auction will take place on Friday along with that for Cardiff-based Welsh Fire, with those for Manchester Originals, Northern Superchargers, Trent Rockets and Southern Brave due to follow next week.Reliance and Knighthead will now enter a six-week period of exclusive talks with Surrey and Warwickshire respectively, as well as the ECB and its financial advisers, in order to complete the deal.View image in fullscreenBirmingham City chair Tom Wagner brought American football legend Tom Brady into the club’s ownership group.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAAs well as the strong valuations, the identity of the first two winning bidders will be viewed as encouraging by the ECB. In addition to their vast resources, the Ambanis are hugely influential within India, while the governing body has actively courted American owners linked to football clubs throughout the process.Knighthead is controlled by hedge fund manager Tom Wagner, who has unveiled ambitious plans for a new stadium since buying Birmingham City, andincludes legendary American football quarterback Tom Bradyas one of the club’s shareholders.Assuming the Reliance deal goes through, it will see Oval Invincibles added to a sporting portfolio that includes Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League and WPL, MI Cape Town (SA20), MI Emirates (ILT20) and MI New York (Major League Cricket).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last summer he led the French sevens team to victory in the Paris Olympics in – shut your eyes and picture it – one of the great seven-minute stretches of sport, with two tries and an assist as they came back from 7-0 to beat Fiji, who had never lost a match in the Olympics, andwin France’s first gold medal.Dupont’s return heralds fizzing new era for what could be a spectacular Six Nations | Robert KitsonRead moreSix months later, Dupont is back to try again for the other target. His chance in the 2023 World Cup has gone, ended by that one-pointloss to South Africa in the quarter-finals, but he has been talking about how motivated he is by the thought of winning the next one, in Australia in 2027. After he skipped last year’s Six Nations to prepare for the Olympics, he leads his gifted team into this tournament, starting with Wales on Friday night at the Stade de France, knowing that, in the words of L’Équipe, it is past time for the “coronation of the golden generation”. For all the tries this French team have scored, for all the Tests they’ve won, that grand slam in 2022 is still their only trophy.Fabien Galthié defended their record in theSix Nationsthis week. They have finished second in four of the five tournaments since he took charge of the team, behind Ireland in both of the last two. “In six years we’ve won 80% of our matches, that’s out of the ordinary,” he said. “For me, a grand slam and four second places is very good.” But for a player like Dupont, very good isn’t good enough. “There’s a lot of disappointment with this team’s track record, given its potential,” Dupont said this week. “This frustration must be transformed into motivation.”If it were only the winning, that would be one thing. But, surprising as it might be to the rest of us, whose chief experience of French rugby iswatching them drub everyone else in the Champions Cup, the sport here is in crisis. The French Rugby Federation (FFR) is running an €18m (£15m) operating deficit, and the headlines this week haven’t been about Dupont’s comeback, but Galthié’s decision to pick Hugo Auradou and Oscar Jégou on the bench.Auradou and Jégou were arrested after being accused of a rapeduring a drunken night out on France’s tour of Argentina last summer, and while the case was dismissed in December, an appeal will take place on 10 February.View image in fullscreenAntoine Dupont celebrates after scoring a try during the Olympics men’s sevens final, one of the highlights for French rugby in the last year.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianGalthié refused to be drawn on the selection this week. “I’ve answered these questions a lot and today, it’s the announcement of the French team and the players who deserve to play,” he said. ‘I’m going to focus solely on these questions. We’re going to focus on the match against Wales, on the Six Nations tournament and on questions that concern rugby.” But the French press and public aren’t about to let him get away so easily, and the decision has sparked public comment from a range of former players, as well as pundits, lawyers and even philosophers.The FFR brought in a new code of conduct after the tour, which stipulates that no one is allowed to drink alcohol without the express permission of the coaching team, and that guests are only allowed in communal areas. “High-level rugby plays a social and cultural role of prime importance in France,” it states. “Every member of a French team must contribute to preserving an exemplary image.” Which has only prompted questions about why they felt able to select Auradou and Jégou when the appeal has yet to be held. The players, who deny any wrongdoing, had been stood down indefinitely and were only deemed eligible for selection again when the initial case was dismissed.It wasn’t an isolated incident.Melvyn Jaminet has been banned for 34 weeksafter he posted an Instagram video promising to “head-butt the first Arab I see”. BastienChalureau was included in the World Cup squad even after he was given a six-month suspended sentence for assault. L’Équipe has just premiered a documentary called Rugby: The house is on fire, which includes interviews with the former partner of Hans N’Kinsi, the Beziers lock who was sentenced to 18 months for domestic violence, a group of female players from Bobigny who were racially abused by the opposition during a match last year, and a hotel owner whose property was ransacked by a group of Top 14 players.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The French need a reason to feel good about the game again, and fast, especially when the FFR’s development strategy has been all about using the Rugby World Cup, and the Olympics, as an opportunity to build its popularity outside its old heartlands.It won’t be easy. After Wales on Friday night, France play away games against England, Italy and Ireland before finishing off with another home game against Scotland. They have a handful of injuries, too, to their defensive captain Gaël Fickou, his fellow centre Jonathan Danty, lock Thibaud Flament andwing Damian Penaud. There’s such strength in depth in the French game that Galthié has been able to replace them all easily enough, and the coach has his star fly-half Romain Ntamack back too, as well – of course – as that man Dupont.

In reply Cornish said: “Our board and our committees are incredibly diverse … and meet all the diversity standards that we need,” although that will not be case under the terms of the newECBagreement with the counties.The new County Partnership Agreement beginning includes enhanced targets for diversity and gender parity, most notably the stipulation that 40% of appointments to county boards and governance committees must be female. Previously the threshold was 30%.There are four women on Middlesex’s 13-strong board and the club’s committees are 79% male, so changes will be required to comply with the CPA, the mechanism through which the ECB distributes around £120m of annual funding to the professional game.The ECB’s Equality Diversity and Inclusion action plan 2025-28, which was published last October, states: “In the new County Partnership Agreement there are enhanced standards, including a requirement of 40% minimum of each gender, and updated ethnic diversity targets to reflect the 2021 UK census.“This action plan will be underpinned by an annual operational plan – a series of detailed tasks to deliver on the commitments. We will publish annual progress updates, as well as a detailed State of Equity inCricketreport in 2026.”The ECB hands out millions to each of the 18 counties and have powers to withhold funding if diversity targets are not met. Middlesex have had a difficult relationship with the ECB in recent years, and in September 2018 were fined £50,000 and given a suspended points deduction for mis-spending funding that had been allocated to the county to support youth-team and grassroots cricket. The possibility of losing more funding would be a major blow to a county who have not recruited any overseas players in the past two seasons due to financial restrictions.“Our board and our committees are incredibly diverse,” Cornish said at Middlesex’s members forum, which was a private event. “They meet all the diversity standards that we need. But being blunt, we’re not gonna, I hate the word, but we’re not gonna be woke and just do political correctness for political correctness.“The club is governed and run by a very, very diverse group of people. It’s unfortunate you’ve got our three ugly mugs here now. But I don’t think anyone, including anyone that was plonked on this presentation group just because they were of a certain gender or ethnicity would value that either.“We have regularly had our CFO [chief financial officer], Illa Sharma, on every forum since she’s been at the club, she just is not at this one today. So we are fully committed to that, but neither will we go through tokenism either. That’s even worse.”Middlesex and the ECB have declined to comment on Cornish’s words. His comments raised eyebrows among some Middlesex members, particularly as the issue of diversity has caused the club problems in the recent past. In 2022 the then chair, Mike O’Farrell, was criticised strongly after he told a parliamentary select committee that cricket’s lack of diversity was down to black players preferring football and rugby and the Asian community prioritising education.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Part of that is because it’s a rather more time-consuming sport than some others. So we’re finding that’s difficult.”Despite widespread criticism, including from the first black woman to play for England, Ebony Rainford-Brent, Cornish defended O’Farrell and he was made a life president of Middlesex at the end of his term as chair.The ECB’s enhanced EDI targets are a direct response to the damning report from the Independent Commission for Equity in CricketThe lack of gender parity in the professional game is stark, with no women among the 18 county chairs, only one chief executive and only 11% female representation on county boards.Explore more on these topicsMiddlesexECBCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not upholding a rule of law.“What those people have been jailed for is trying to get information to the public that the fossil fuel companies have been systematically concealing from the public for decades and decades. And good information is the lifeblood of democracy and that’s why those people have been jailed, for trying to get that to the public.”Protesters held placards showing photographs of jailed activists, including those whose cases were being heard in court on Thursday, as well as photographs of famous political prisoners such as Angela Davis and Nelson Mandela who had, said Crosland, “fought for the freedoms that we enjoy”.The broadcasters Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Chris Packham were among those who joined the protest. “We feel our basic democratic rights to protest peacefully are being eroded,” Fearnley-Whittingstall said.View image in fullscreenProtesters held placards showing the photos of jailed activists.Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian“We are here in solidarity with the 16 defendants who were given draconian sentences last year for entirely peaceful protest, that they did because their consciences demanded it from them, not for personal gain. Now we seem to have a judicial situation where acting on your conscience is almost seen to be an aggravating factor in your sentence – it used to be a mitigating factor.”Soon after protesters occupied the Strand they were surrounded by yellow-jacketed police officers, who warned them that if they did not move, a section 14 order would be imposed and they would be arrested. The Metropolitan police said protesters left the road at 1.45pm. “No arrests were made in relation to the sit-down in the road as no serious disruption was caused,” a spokesperson for the force saidInside court four of the Royal Courts of Justice, Jocelyn Ledward KC led the crown’s response to the appeals. Last year Ledward led the prosecution of five activists who received the longest-ever sentences for peaceful protest, for a conspiracy to block the M25.Roger Hallam, the co-founder of Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, was sentenced to five years for his part in the conspiracy, while his four co-defendants received four years each.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Meanwhile, advocates are pushing for states to meet their ambitious climate goals using methods and technologies that don’t require federal support.“Our states, cities, businesses, and local institutions stand ready to pick up the baton of US climate leadership and do all they can – despite federal complacency – to continue the shift to a clean energy economy,” Gina McCarthy, former climate adviser to Biden and co-chair of theAmerica Is All Incoalition of climate-concerned states and cities, said this month.Among the most promising activity: the creation of a fund to take Trump to court, the passage of policies to make oil companies pay for climate damages, and the continual buildout of already-permitted wind power.“The state is not helpless against the president’s assault on the environment,” said Devin Callahan, communications director at theNew YorkLeague of Conservation Voters. “We need our leaders to recognize the gravity of this moment.”1.New York’s major climate billsHow it’s leading:Weeks after Trump’s election, the state’s governor, Kathy Hochul, signed several major climate bills into law. One will force big oil and gas producers to help pay for climate effects to which their emissions have contributed for the next 25 years, similar to ameasureVermont passed months before.Another new law will ensure schools are built far from from highly polluting roadways, and a third will expand the state’s10-year-oldfracking ban to outlaw the process of injecting liquified carbon dioxide to pull gas from the ground. Days after Trump’s election, Hochul also abruptly resurrected a plan to enact a toll for driving in congested zones, and this month pledged to allocate$1bnto greening the economy.In response to Trumpexiting the US from the Paris climate accordsfor the second time, Hochul also led a group of two dozen governors, representing nearly 55% of the US population, redoubling commitments to slash planet-warming pollution: “Our states and territories continue to have broad authority under the US constitution to protect our progress and advance the climate solutions we need,” Hochulwrote.During Trump’s first term, New York also signed an ambitious 2019 mandate to obtain 70% of its electricity from renewable energy by 2030. Now, officials have a major opportunity to ensure that goal is met – even under Trump.What to watch:Despite climate progress in other areas, Hochul has recently disappointed climate advocates by delaying two state climate programs to place a price on carbon emissions, and to gradually transition homes away from gas-powered heat.Both measures would help reduce emissions and lower energy costs – and neither can be derailed by Trump, said Callahan of New York League of Conservation Voters. Hochul could recommit to both, he said.Trump’s assault on climate policy also need not necessarily stop the clean energy transition. In fact, a 2023 policy makes New York poised to be a wind and solar leader.That year, amid concern that New York was not on track with its climate targets, New York enabled a state agency, the New York Power Authority (NYPA), to build carbon-free power. Since it is well-resourced, it can do so without the federal incentives that Trump is scrapping, advocates say. The agency also owns land where clean energy infrastructure could be built, which could make it more resilient to permitting restrictions, said Sarahana Shrestha, a socialist state assembly member.“NYPA is well-suited to insulate New York from the Trump administration when it comes to our climate goals,” she said.Advocates havelong saidthe NYPA should bring enough renewable energy online to enable New York to reach its goal of 70% renewable power by the decade’s end. But this week, the authority said it would build just one-fifth of that capacity, infuriating advocates.The NYPA’s CEO also said the agency should not be required to lead the energy transition. Advocates are now calling on Hochul to fire the NYPA head and work to put the state back on track with its clean energy mandate.2.California gets ready for legal fightsHow it’s leading:California is often seen as a leader of the anti-Trump resistance, and with good reason. Just two days after Trump’s November re-election, California lawmakers held aspecial sessionto begin preparing to defend its progressive policies from his administration.Now, state lawmakers are working to put money toward that cause. The California governor, Gavin Newsom, and Democratic legislative leaders are planning to allocate $50m in state money to fund the legal costs of fighting against Trump’s administration. The statesued federal officials 123 timesbetween 2017 and 2021, according to a CalMatters analysis of state data.Trump has already taken aim at California this month, threatening towithholddisaster aid from the state amid devastating wildfires and falsely claiming in asocial media postthat the US military intervened to ensure water was used to fight the flames.The president has also sowed chaos within California’s electric vehicle economy, signing orders to freeze charging infrastructure funding and abandon Biden’s ambitious vehicle decarbonization goals. In another order, Trump’s White House also said it would seek to “terminate” state emissions waivers “that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles”.It took aim at special permission California received in December to enact regulations forcing automakers to sell only carbon-free new vehicles in the state by 2035. But state lawmakers have pledged tofight back.What to watch:It remains to be seen how many of California’s legal challenges against the Trump administration will successfully overturn policy. Trump lost more than two-thirds of the lawsuits filed against his administration – a lower rate than that of the three administrations prior,according to one New York University analysis.In the meantime, Newsom appears to be taking a different approach to his relationship with Trump. While he took a more combative tack during the president’s first term, last week Newsom met him in Los Angeles andthanked himfor his visit.View image in fullscreenWind turbines at an energy farm in Tracy, California.Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPAAs they watch the Newsom-Trump fight over climate policy play out, California environmentalists are also working to pass stronger climate policies. Many, for instance, are calling on the state to pass its own measure forcing fossil fuel companies to help pay for climate damages. In the past week,more than 40,000 peoplesigned a petition supporting the bill.3.Rhode Island embraces renewablesHow it’s leading:During Trump’s first term, environmentalists and labor leaders in Rhode Island worked together to push for an ambitious bill requiring that by 2033, the state must procure 100% of its energy from renewable energy. It passed just three months after Trump left office.Thefollowing year, officials passed a law mandating the state bring 1,000 megawatts of wind power online by 2027, andanother onein 2022 requiring strong labor standards for all new renewable energy.As Trumpassertsthat fossil-fuel expansionbenefitsAmerican workers, Rhode Island has demonstrated that renewables can create good jobs, said Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO. This could make it easier for organizers to build support for clean power, even among conservatives.“This is domestically sourced energy, so we don’t have to rely on foreign sources of oil or gas that mean we’re subject to price instability when Russia invades Ukraine,” Crowley said. “And we’re showing people it creates good jobs here in the United States, so even from a conservative’s point of view, offshore wind can be a win-win.”What to watch:Trump may not derail all progress on renewables – for now. Though he has hit the pause button on new offshore wind leasing, the impacts in Rhode Island and the rest of New England could be limited, because it does not require fully permitted projects to come to a halt.“We have a dozen fully permitted projects in New England,” said Crowley. “Those ones look like they’re going to be fine.”More attacks on offshore windcould be on the wayfrom federal officials, which could potentially further imperil those permitted wind projects. But even if they do, officials could keep working on measures that don’t require Trump’s approval, Crowley said.The Rhode Island governor, Dan McKee, for instance, included a measure to reduce carbon emissions from buildings in his budget proposal for 2025 – something climate advocates have demanded for years and are hoping is finalized.“Building decarbonization doesn’t need federal money or approval,” Crowley said.Another area where progress may continue: geothermal energy. The carbon-free power source may beless susceptibleto Trump’s policies than wind or solar, experts say.This year, advocates hope to pass a bill boosting the carbon-free power source, and to begin constructing pilot projects.“That’s a state-based initiative and it doesn’t need federal support,” said Crowley.4.Red states, tooHow they’re leading:It’s not just Democratic states that can continue pushing for climate progress under Trump. Red states will also be integral.Biden’s signature climate policy, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), provided record-breaking incentives in tax credits for companies to build wind, solar and other carbon-free technologies, as well as other climate-focused programs.No Republicans on Capitol Hill voted for the bill. However, red districts benefited most from those monies, receiving 85% of the investment from the policy and68% of the jobs created. As a result, many saw huge expansions of wind, solar and other green industries.Trump last week froze the distribution of unspent IRA funds. But Republican states aren’t giving up without a fight.What to watch:Last week, at least eight Republicans gave testimony calling on the federal governmentnot to slashIRA tax credits. Speaking before the House ways and means committee, they explained that the law has created economic opportunity in their districts.In August, 18 House Republicans also implored Mike Johnson, the speaker, to preserve the incentives. “Energy tax credits have spurred innovation, incentivized investment, and created good jobs in many parts of the country – including many districts represented by members of our conference,”they wrote in a letter.And it’s not only politicians who are working to preserve the credits. In the swing state of Wisconsin, which has a Republican-led legislature and Democratic governor and has seen millions of dollars ininvestmentfrom the IRA, rank-and-file union members are writing letters in defense of the credits.“Our members who work on these projects are the best ones to explain what these projects mean to them,” said Kent Miller, president of the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council.IRA incentives led Wisconsin’s four largest investor-owned utilities to commit last year to building out clean energy with unionized labor – progress workers don’t want to see derailed.“In some cases … because of these projects, they were able to buy their first home, or they were able to save enough to put their kid through college,” Miller said. “That needs to be heard.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisUS politicsCaliforniaNew YorkRhode IslandWest CoastPollutionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is astonishingly remote: a tiny scattering of research cabins in 1.7m hectares (4.2m acres) of virgin forest. For scientists, it comes about as close as you can to observing rainforest wildlife in a world untouched by human industry.Almost every year since his arrival in 2000,ecologist John G Blakehad been there to count the birds. Rising before the sun, he would record the density and variety of the dawn chorus. Slowly walking the perimeter of the plots, he noted every species he saw. And for one day every year, he and other researchers would cast huge “mist” nets that caught flying birds in their weave, where they would be counted, untangled and freed.View image in fullscreenA fisheye view of lowland rain forest from the top of the canopy tower at Tiputini.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyFor years, these counts captured birds’ annual fluctuations; they had good and bad years, seasons in which nests were disrupted by storms and others when they boomed. But by about 2012, Blake and his collaborators could see something was shifting. The birds were dying: not in masses at once, struck down by a plague, but generation by generation. The yearly fluctuations he had spent a decade recording slowly stopped their upward leaps, the trend line transforming into an unyielding downward slope. By 2022, their numbers had almost halved. Blake did not need the graph to tell him something was wrong; when he rose to listen to the dawn chorus, he could hear that it was muted. Songs were missing. Some species simply vanished.“A number of them I have not heard for quite a few years now,” he says, over a broken video connection from the research centre; far from the outside world, it has intermittent power and relies on a satellite connection. “There are definitely some species that, for whatever reason, do not seem to be here any more.”View image in fullscreenMale wire-tailed manakin (Pipra filicauda) at a calling perch in Tiputini.Photograph: Tim Laman/NPL/AlamyIn North America and Europe, scientists have long warned bird numbers are falling, but mostly that has been explained by their contact with humans. As cities and farms expand, forests around them become fragments, animal habitats shrink, pollution contaminates rivers, pesticides and fertilisers kill off insects. Even pets are a factor – in the US, domestic cats are killing up to an estimated4 billion birdsa year. Tiputini, however, is one of the few patches of the planet not directly feeling those pressures: no nearby farms, no polluting factories, no encroaching loggers, no roads in. Yet, their birds were dying.At other remote sites around the world, scientists had been starting to observe similar trends. In Brazil, theBiological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project(BDFFP) is an ecological study located deep in primary Amazon forest, unreachable by road. These regions hold some of the oldest living forests on the planet – they evaded the ice age events that remade forests in the US and Europe with the growth and retreat of glaciers. “In the Amazon, we’ve had pockets of stable forests over millions of years,” says ecologist Jared Wolfe, one of the project’s research scientists. “The site is truly amazing.”The idea was that if you have huge expanses of forest, that’s going to protect everything … it does protect a lot of things. But apparently not everythingJohn G Blake, ecologistBut in 2020, when researchers there compared bird numbers with the 1980s, they found a number of speciesin deep decline. At another site in Panama, scientists working in a 22,000-hectare (54,000-acre) stretch of intact foresthad been gathering bird datasince the mid-1970s. By 2020, their numbers had gone off a cliff: 70% of species had declined, most of them severely; 88% had lost more than half their population. At some sites, scientists are beginning to observe “almost complete community collapse”, says Wolfe. “This is occurring in pristine environments, which is really unsettling.”View image in fullscreenThe BDFFP ecological study is located deep in primary Brazilian Amazon forest, unreachable by road.Photograph: Courtesy of Vitek JirinecFor decades scientists have been trying to understand what is going on. Blake and collaborator ornithologist Bette A Loiselle published their first paper documenting the declines in 2015, but could not definitively say what was causing them. They tested birds for disease and parasites, and found no clear links. They considered the possibility that an unknown toxin or pollutant had seeped in – but there was no evidence of that. “I suspect whatever is causing these declines is something much more widespread,” Blake says. “It would not be something specific to the Tiputini area.”The most likely answer, they concluded, was the climate crisis. “There’s very little else – at least that I know of – that has such large scale worldwide impacts,” says Blake.A decade later, their instincts are proving correct. This week, Wolfe and collaborators published new work directly linking rising temperatures to bird declines. Their research,published in Science Advances, tracked birds living in the forest understory at the BDFFP against detailed climate data. They found that harsher dry seasons significantly reduced the survival of 83% of species. A 1C increase in dry season temperature would reduce the average survival of birds by 63%.Exactly how the heat is causing bird numbers to decline is tricky to pinpoint, Wolfe says, but “these birds are intrinsically linked to small, small changes in temperature and precipitation”. One of the most immediate ways a heating planet hurts wildlife is by putting them out of step with their food sources: when fewer insects survive dry seasons, or leaves bloom and fruit ripens at different times, birds find themselves unable to forage and feed their young. Their nests begin to fail. Within a few generations, their numbers fall.View image in fullscreenLuke Powell, left, and Jared Wolfe collect data from mist-netted birdsPhotograph: Courtesy of Tristan SpinskiThe losses documented in these remote stations have implications far beyond birds. “The idea has always been that if you have huge expanses of forest, then that’s going to protect everything,” Blake says. “And, well, it does protect a lot of things. But apparently not everything.”Amazon birds shrink but grow longer wings in sign of global heatingRead moreMost western conservation works by sectioning off wilderness, as national parks or reserves. These places are like arks: reservoirs of wildlife that we hope will be saved, even as people transform the land around them. But what the researchers were seeing with birds suggested that these arks are far more fragile than first thought.View image in fullscreenOne of the BDFFP research stations .Photograph: Courtesy of Vitek JirinecWolfe likens the problem to pollution in a large body of water. When scientists measure water quality, they think about pollution in two ways. “Point source” pollution might be a gushing oil pipe: it’s doing huge damage, but by shutting it off you fix the problem. “Nonpoint source” would be the small dribbles of oil coming from every car in the area, washed down off the roads and into the waterways: each contribution might be tiny, but the cumulative effect can be huge – and hard to shut off. “It’s very difficult to combat,” Wolfe says. What is happening to the birds “feels like a nonpoint source; a wicked complex problem where you have breakdowns in biological interactions that are causing these declines.”But realising what is happening is necessary to developing solutions, Wolfe says. “One thing I am becoming particularly tired of as a professional researcher, is writing these obituaries for birds,” he says. The research on pristine regions can also reveal potential solutions: early data suggests some forests are bucking the declines. Identifying why – and protecting them – is crucial.View image in fullscreenA chestnut woodpecker (Celeus elegans) in the Amazon.Photograph: Courtesy of Philip StoufferFor the scientists who are seeing birds disappear, there is grief in watching some of the most beautiful, ecologically rich places in the world fall into decline. “It is depressing,” Blake says. “When we first got here and started looking, we were just totally amazed at how many birds there were, and their diversity. We keep doing the work – but it’s harder to get excited about doing it because there’s so little.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverage.Explore more on these topicsBirdsThe age of extinctionAmazon rainforestEndangered speciesEndangered habitatsTrees and forestsBrazilEcuadorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This would be a gross miscarriage of justice.“Criminalising men, women and children who have fled conflicts in countries such as Sudan does not disrupt the smuggling gangs’ business model. When a refugee is clambering into a boat with an armed criminal threatening them, they are not thinking about UK laws but are simply trying to stay alive.”The failure to repeal Priti Patel’s Illegal Migration Act means that asylum and human rights claims from countries including Albania, Georgia and India are automatically inadmissible, a spokesperson for Asylum Aid said.Alison Pickup, the organisation’s executive director, said: “Further criminalisation and measures blocking people from protection will do nothing to address the causes of forced displacement and unauthorised movement through Europe to the UK.”Labour hopes the new legislation will help turn the tide against people-smuggling networks that have facilitatedmore than 150,000 small boat arrivals in the UK since 2018. More than 1,000 people have arrived in the UK since the start of this year.It follows a record 78 deaths in the Channel last year, as people smugglers launch flimsy dinghies to sea with up to 120 passengers onboard.The bill will make it an offence to “endanger another life during perilous sea crossing to the UK”. Anyone involved in coercive behaviour, “including preventing offers of rescue”, will face prosecution and an increased sentence of up to five years in prison.This means anyone “rushing” vessels into the sea as they try to launch could also be prosecuted.Home Office sources said some people on small boats had refused to allow the French authorities to board because they wished to enter UK waters and claim asylum.As part of Starmer’spromise to “smash the gangs”, those caught selling or handling small boat parts could also be jailed for up to 14 years as the Home Office will make it “illegal to supply or handle items suspected of being for use by organised crime groups”.Where someone is suspected of selling or handling small boat parts or sharing suspect information online, officials believe the bill will allow them to use these offences to make arrests.In some circumstances, parents could be prosecuted for endangering the lives of their children if the bill becomes law, a human rights assessment of the bill found.“Although it is very unlikely, there is no absolute bar to prosecuting parents who have taken their children on journeys which come within the ambit of the endangerment offence, which could result in the breakup of families,” the assessment said.The Home Office hopes to use the new offences to extradite some of the suppliers and people smugglers responsible for Channel crossings who are caught abroad, as well as to prosecute any who enter the UK.Existing rules mean law enforcement officers are unable to intervene until after a small boat crossing.In an upgrade to serious crime prevention orders, the bill will give law enforcement new powers to impose interim serious crime prevention orders, allowing them to place instant restrictions on organised immigration criminals alongside other serious criminals. This could include bans on travel, internet and mobile phone use, with curbs also leading to social media blackouts, curfews and restricted access to finances.Natasha Tsangarides, the associate director of advocacy at the charity Freedom from Torture, said: “This bill will do nothing to address the root causes of forced displacement. Instead, cracking down on the methods refugees use to escape war and persecution will only make their journeys more dangerous.“We fear that the government’s current approach, directed through the frame of counter-terrorism, risks intensifying the vulnerability of those who are forced to rely on smugglers in the absence of safe routes.“If the government truly wants to address the challenges posed by the movement of refugees across borders, then it would be better directed towards stopping the torture that pushes people from their homes in the first place.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeRefugeesCrimeFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

He said he knew people who can help me,” she told the court. Dzhambazov said there was “a police university in Wembley” that he could get her into, though the court has heard his only academic connection was to organise council-funded English classes for Bulgarian migrants.The fake identification had his face and a flag on it and, while other members of her family questioned whether he was a police officer, she said she never doubted it. “Even when I was arrested [in February 2023] I didn’t believe something was wrong,” she said.Dzhambazov has already pleaded guilty to spying for Russia, carrying out surveillance tasks as part of a spy ring run by his friend Orlin Roussev, based in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Roussev, who has also admitted guilt, was accused of working for Jan Marsalek, an Austrian fugitive and Russian agent based in Moscow.Gaberova said she was duped by a man who at one point claimed he had brain cancer, sending her a selfie of himself “with tissues around his head” after what he said was an operation.Their relationship began after he took her on a trip to Valencia in September 2021, the court heard. Dzhambazov said he was surveilling the Bulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grozev, known for his exposures of Russian espionage, claiming he was corrupt.Gaberovasaid that when Grozev arrived in the Spanish city by plane on 12 September 2021, Dzhambazov brought Gaberova to the airport car park and asked her to look out for him. She ended up following Grozev to his hotel in a taxi, passing on where he was staying, she told the court.Asked if she thought it unusual to be asked to conduct surveillance without training, Gaberova said Dzhambazov had “an answer for everything”. She said he had told her it was normal for Interpol to have civilians following persons of interest “because sometimes police people you can recognise very well and normal people don’t act different”.Gaberova told the court the two had begun a sexual relationship the previous night because he had told her that he would split from his long-term girlfriend, Katrin Ivanova, 33, the next morning. “I was OK with that because he was going to break up with her,” she said.Ivanova, another defendant, gave evidence earlier this week to say her relationship with Dzhambazov continued for another year and a half until all three were arrested. Gaberova said she did not meet Ivanova until after their arrest, although prosecutors say the two women were involved in surveillance at different times.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

They warned that the shift in priorities was out of line with the government’s ambition to improve the health of the nation and would prove damaging and even “dangerous” for some groups of patients.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, sought to allay such concerns by ordering the health service to concentrate on delivering shorter waiting times for A&E and cancer care and hospital treatment. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to benefit from faster access and diagnosis. Surveys have shown that long delays for NHS care are the public’s greatest concern.Streeting announced the overhaul when he handed theNHSits mandate and planning guidance – the “success measures” it must focus its energy and resources on – for 2025-26. He has cut the NHS’s list of priorities from 32 for 2024-25 to just 18 for the next financial year.“This new approach will see the NHS focus on what matters most to patients – cutting waiting lists, getting seen promptly at A&E and being able to get a GP appointment,” Streeting said.NHS England chief under fire again as MPs ‘exasperated’ by responsesRead moreBut that did not head off criticism from health groups. Dr Sarah Hughes, the chief executive of the charity Mind, accused ministers of “deprioritising mental health” after an array of schemes to improve care were dropped. They included plans to give 75% of those with severe mental illness an annual physical health checkup, ensure at least 700,000 people a year complete a course of psychological talking therapies, and expand maternal mental health support to at least 66,000 women.Obstetricians and gynaecologists said the abandonment of plans to ensure each of the 42 NHS regions in England has a dedicated women’s health hub by last December was in breach of Labour’s election manifesto commitment to prioritise women’s health. However, 39 of the 42 integrated health boards already have at least one.The 14 dropped targets also include getting 80% of those with high blood pressure on to statins, giving 75% of people with learning disabilities an annual check-up and increasing childhood vaccination rates – which have fallen in recent years – to levels recommended by the World Health Organization.“Reducing the overall number of national NHS targets is not necessarily a bad thing,” said Sarah Woolnough, the chief executive of the King’s Fund thinktank.But, she added: “Setting a relatively large number of goals for hospital care, while losing targets for childhood vaccination and the offering of medicines to people at risk of cardiovascular disease appears to be at odds with ministers’ ambition to prevent illness and not just treat it.”The previous plan to increase the amount of dental activity undertaken by the NHS has been replaced for 2025-26 with a more limited pledge to expand the number of urgent dental appointments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People who cannot afford private care, or who need prevention to avoid worse problems, should come first.”Fiona Carragher, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said she was “shocked” that the target to improve diagnosis of dementia was not in the new guidance.Jon Sparkes, the chief executive of Mencap, said: “Scrapping vital NHS targets for people with a learning disability is a dangerous step backwards.”The new instructions to NHS England will also force it to shed 2,000 jobs as part of a drive to make £325m in savings next year, while the service as a whole has been told to reduce its costs by 1% overall – about £1bn.“In what will undoubtedly be another tough financial year, the NHS will continue its relentless focus on boosting productivity and driving efficiencies for the benefits of patients and taxpayers,” said Amanda Pritchard, NHS England’s chief executive.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthEnglandWes StreetingHealth policyCancerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Life’s too short.”Summer holiday childcare in UK now costs £1,000 a child, research findsRead moreAfter taking over as education secretary in July,Bridget Phillipsonconfirmed plans for the fines to rise from £60 to £80 per parent this year.“Tackling the epidemic of school absence is everyone’s responsibility – government, schools, parents, and children – we need a national effort to get young people back in the classroom,” Phillipson said.“But behaviour like term-time holidays cannot be changed with support alone. This is why fines have a vital place in our system, so everyone is held accountable for ensuring our children are in school.“When children miss school unnecessarily, all children suffer, as teachers’ attention is diverted to helping them catch back up. We will not apologise for ensuring every child is in school accessing high and rising standards so they can achieve and thrive.”Some local authorities are more aggressive in levying fines – Barnsley in South Yorkshire issued more than 6,000 fines among parents of its 31,000 pupils aged between five and 16. Warrington borough council, meanwhile, has a policy of no fines.Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said that with holidays accounting for 91% of fines for absence it was clear that cheaper trips were a major lure.“For many families the threat of a fine is not acting as a significant deterrent in the way the government hoped it would. This is largely due to the exorbitant charges for holidays outside of term time,” Whiteman said.“We have long-argued that fines are a blunt tool for tackling this issue and the data appears to bear this out once again.”Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “While children and young people being in school during term time is clearly beneficial, unless we address the reasons behind term-time holidays this situation will continue.”Parental fines rose sharply in 2013, after headteachers had their discretion to authorise term-time holidays removed other than for exceptional circumstances such as funerals.Since Covid both authorised absences for illness and unauthorised absences have remained stubbornly high, withchildren’s mental health and anxietyamong the biggest drivers.Explore more on these topicsSchool attendance and absenceBridget PhillipsonSchool holidaysSchoolsChildrenDepartment for EducationLocal governmentShareReuse this content"

Both groups wanted honesty, competence and reform – but the difference was in their faith in mainstream parties to deliver it, the thinktank said.Outsiders felt they were victims of a system run by remote elites serving their own interests instead of implementing simple solutions to political problems. They placed greater value on “common sense” over independent evidence, and strong, decisive leaders over negotiation and compromise.View image in fullscreenSupporters of the National Rally leader, Marine Le Pen, cheer in Henin-Beaumont, northern France, at projections of her vote share in the first round of elections, 30 June 2024.Photograph: Thibault Camus/APIn the UK, older voters were likelier to be outsiders, while inFranceand Germany – where the far-right National Rally and Alternative for Germany have surged in popularity – younger and older voters were equally likely to be outsiders.Across the countries surveyed, there was a high degree of economic pessimism among voters, who expected children born today to be worse off than their parents. This feeling was most acute in the UK – where 49% expected children to be worse off, compared with 26% who expected them to be better off – and in Australia and France.The report found that this economic pessimism was linked to declining faith in democracy. Of those voters who said they had negative views about democracy, 77% said they believed that children born today would be worse off than their parents.Voters generally thought that technology made their lives better, but were ambivalent about its impact on public services. Asked how optimistic they were about potential improvements brought about by AI, most placed themselves between a three and seven out of 10. Outsiders who were distrustful of politicians were much more pessimistic about technology.The report concluded that “the key to bringing coalitions back together is effective delivery” and “paradoxically, modern technology can offer part of an answer”. It suggested that, for example, introducing digital IDs, which the UK government has backed, could help assuage concerns about controlling immigration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the same time, credible answers must be provided for legitimate grievances, including around immigration.”Rob Ford, a professor of political science at the University of Manchester, said the report reflected that “while the TBI has provided us with an elegant and rigorous report to give us a diagnosis of the problem, they don’t offer much by way of a cure. I’m not sure anyone has the answer.”He added: “The central conundrum of our times is: is there any kind of deliverable performance for any government that voters will reward? We’re seeing every single incumbent getting kicked out whatever they do, whatever they support, whatever narrative they promote.“Take a typical Reform voter – they will say, ‘here’s a list I demand that the government do’. Some of those things are impossible for any government to do. They will say they want net migration down to zero and major improvements to the healthcare system, and also lower taxes. How? If you deliver any one of those things you are making it drastically harder to deliver the others.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThinktanksThe far rightFar rightGermanyFranceCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

A bishop cannot be above the law. A bishop cannot be dealt with differently from a priest. If anything, a bishop must be held to greater scrutiny. I regret we as a church have not properly and satisfactorily addressed concerns that have been raised.”Mason has been absent from her post since April 2024. She described her absence as “long and terrible”, adding: “For my part, I am deeply sorry for my absence and silence. It has been excruciating.”In a statement, Perumbalath said he was retiring with immediate effect. He is 58, 12 years younger than the church’s compulsory retirement age of 70 for bishops.He said: “Having sought the permission of his majesty the king, I have today taken the decision to retire from active ministry in the Church of England.“I have consistently maintained that I have not done anything wrong and continue to do so.”He said the allegations had been investigated by the C of E’s national safeguarding team, which found them unsubstantiated. One of the allegations was also investigated by the police, resulting in no further action.“Despite this, media reports have treated me as guilty on all charges and treated these allegations as fact,” he said. “The rush to judgment and my trial by media (be that social or broadcast) has made my position untenable due to the impact it will have on the diocese of Liverpool and the wider church whilst we await further reviews and next steps.”He added: “This is not a resignation occasioned by fault or by any admission of liability. Rather it has become clear that stepping back from my ministry and waiting for the completion of further reviews would mean a long period of uncertainty for the diocese and all those who serve it.”Perumbalath’s departure comes less than three months after Justin Welby wasforced to resignas archbishop of Canterbury over his response to a separate abuse scandal.Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York and the current de facto leader of the church, hasfaced calls to quitover his handling of a priest at the centre of a sexual abuse case.According to Channel 4 News, Cottrell knew of the sexual assault allegation before Perumbalath was enthroned as bishop of Liverpool in 2023.Some C of E figures claimed on social media that Cottrell had known for some time that the allegations would become public.Tim Howles, a priest and research fellow at the University of Oxford,posted: “He knew last year that the story about the bishop of Liverpool would definitely come out. He knew for sure. And he still presented himself as the one through whom reform for the Church of England could come about.”Jayne Ozanne, a former member of the C of E’s ruling body, the General Synod, claimed on X that the allegations against Perumbalath had been covered up by ⁦Cottrell. “I cannot believe Stephen thought it would just ‘go away’,”she posted. Cottrell needed to “explain what he knew, said and did”.One priest told the Guardian that, after Welby’s resignation, Cottrell had sought to reassure the church that he would bring stability and enact reform, despite knowing about the allegations. “There is absolute dismay among the rank and file. There is no confidence that anyone has any grip on this, and no idea about what’s coming next,” the priest said.Another prominent church member said Cottrell should resign but would try to “dig in”.Cottrell said in a statement: “I respect [Perumbalath’s] decision and thank him for his ministry … I am committed to ensuring stability during this time of transition.”The synod is expected to consider how the C of E can rebuild trust and recover credibility when it meets next month for a five-day session. The meeting is likely to be dominated by issues relating to abuse, safeguarding and the C of E’s failures to take swift and effective action.Two separate allegations have been made against Perumbalath. One was of kissing without consent and groping, and the second was of sexual harassment.Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Newcastle, who has led calls for action over safeguarding failures, said she was “shocked and appalled” at the allegations against Perumbalath. Sheposted on X: “Yet again, failures at the heart of the institution of the Church of England, and specifically by its leadership, undermine credibility and confidence in the church.”Explore more on these topicsAnglicanismLiverpoolChristianityReligionEnglandJustin WelbynewsShareReuse this content"

In its sanctions notice, the Foreign Office said the former Chelsea FC owner was “involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the government of Russia”.The APPG’s chair, Joe Powell MP, wrote: “It has also been reported that Abramovich has at least £3.2bn of UK assets frozen. I would like to ask whether the department has made any considerations as to whether such assets could be used against any potential money owed.“When Abramovich was forced to sell the Chelsea Football Club, approximately £2.5bn was pledged to humanitarian programmes for victims of the Ukraine war. However, to date, not a single penny of that money has been spent.“In light of these concerns, it is critical that we understand what measures HMRC is taking to investigate this matter and ensure that any unpaid taxes are recovered. Given the scale of the sums involved, ensuring that any unpaid taxes are recovered is a matter of public interest, particularly at a time when funds are urgently needed for public services and to manage the national debt.”A spokesperson for HMRC said: “We’re continuing to lead international efforts to improve global transparency and are committed to ensuring everyone pays the right tax under the law, regardless of wealth or status.”Powell, who is Labour’s MP for Kensington & Bayswater, also raised the issue during questions to the leader of the house, Lucy Powell, on Thursday, asking the government to “scrutinise whether HMRC have all the resources they need to pursue this case and recover as much money as possible for the Treasury”.Powell said: “He’s absolutely right to raise matters of tax evasion, tax avoidance and in some cases ... industrial scale tax avoidance like the one he’s raised. Obviously, I’m not going to get into individual cases but the gap is still too wide and it was a staggering £36bn just a few years ago.”She said the government was recruiting 5,000 new compliance officers to close a £36bn gap between duty that is owed and what is actually paid.In a separate, written question to the Treasury, the former Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith asked if Rachel Reeves would “take steps to ensure that funds potentially owed by Roman Abramovich to HMRC are (a) investigated and (b) reclaimed”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Experts said this raised questions about whether corporation tax should have been paid in Britain.Details of Roman Abramovich’s hedge fund investments emerged as part of theCyprus Confidentialseries, based on the largest ever leak of financial information from the Mediterranean tax haven, which the Guardian and its reporting partners have been examining since 2022.On Tuesday, the investigation also revealeddetails of a schemethat suggest tens of millions in VAT was avoided on the cost of running Abramovich’s fleet of superyachts, in Italy,Cyprusand a number of other EU countries.Earlier this week, the Cypriot MP Alexandra Attalides asked her government whether Blue Ocean Yacht Management, the company at the centre of the scheme, had paid any debts that might be due to the state and, if not, what steps the authorities had taken.Explore more on these topicsRoman AbramovichHMRCCorporate governanceCyprusBritish Virgin IslandsItalynewsShareReuse this content"

The “high-pressure” role involved supporting the team in their day-to-day activities.Farooq, from Birmingham, who is of British Asian heritage, was not shortlisted for interview, and later claimed that “unconscious bias” meant his application had not been taken forward.British Asian man sues Liverpool FC over ‘racial discrimination’Read moreAt a tribunal at Liverpool civil and family court, the club successfully argued there was “no evidence whatsoever that race played any part at all”, and that his application was unsuccessful owing to a lack of experience.The tribunal heard that 487 people had applied to the role, with 444 of these applications considered, before a more manageable shortlist was drawn up.At the time, Farooq was in a temporary role, managing a catering contract at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the tribunal heard.His application was initially rejected because of his salary demands, the tribunal heard, and when the first person to be offered the job turned down the role and applications were considered again, Farooq’s was rejected owing to a lack of experience in an operational first-team role.Giving evidence during the tribunal, the hiring manager, head of first-team operations Louise Dobson, said: “We wanted somebody who was dealing with players, coaching staff, on a day-to-day level. Someone who was dealing with catering was not what we were looking for.”Farooq said he first believed he had been discriminated against when he saw on LinkedIn in May 2023 that a temporary staffer called Anna Garnett, who had limited experience, was fulfilling the role.However, the tribunal heard, she had been brought in to cover some basic administrative tasks before the successful candidate, Zac Foley, was able to take up the position.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the stage she carried out the shortlisting again, with the intent to reduce the number of 444 applications to a more manageable number, there are no facts or inferences from which we could conclude it had anything to do with the claimant’s race.”One of two magistrates sitting with her disagreed, believing that Farooq should have been taken forward for interview.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Under UK employment law a 30-day consultation period means a maximum of 99 staff can be made redundant within a 90-day period. The job cuts do not impact the publisher’s US operation, which was the subject of a round of redundancies amounting to about 10% of its workforce last year.The move follows a managerial restructure in October that saw Verity, the editor of MailNewspaperssince 2021, become editor-in-chief of the Daily Mail across all platforms.The restructure also saw Groom, the publisher and editor-in-chief of MailOnline, promoted to his new role leading DMG Media, which also owns the freesheet Metro, the i newspaper and New Scientist magazine.The publisher is hoping to further drive its digital paid-for content strategy, Mail+, which hit 100,000 paying subscribers in November having only been launched in January last year.Most of MailOnline’s articles remain free to read but Mail+, which is to be launched in the US later this year, contains paywalled core content including showbusiness, royal stories, health, personal finance advice and columnists.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The longer we follow its orbit, the more accurate our future predictions of its trajectory become.”The asteroid ranks as a three on theTorino Impact Hazard Scale, indicating a close encounter that merits attention from astronomers because there is a 1% or greater chance of a collision in the next decade that would inflict “localised destruction”. The Torino scale ranges from zero, when there is no risk, to 10 when a collision is certain and poses a threat to the future of civilisation as we know it.The only asteroid ever to receive a higher rating is Apophis which made headlines in 2004. Apophis was initially rated a four on the Torino scale but was later downgraded as observations showed that it posed no threatfor at least a century.Gareth Collins, professor of planetary science at Imperial College London, said that an increase in monitoring of near Earth objects will make detections like asteroid 2024 YR4 much more common. “At this stage, the best thing to do is to continue tracking the asteroid for as long as possible so that we can predict its trajectory with more confidence,” he said.A space rock the size of asteroid 2024 YR4 would not unleash a mass extinction event as happened 66m years ago: the asteroid that triggered the demise of the dinosaurs was 10 to 15km wide. But 100 metre-wide space rocks, which impact Earth on average every few thousand years, still have the potential to cause catastrophic damage on the city scale.The detection of the asteroid has activated two UN-endorsed global asteroid response groups. The International Asteroid Warning Network has swung into action to make further observations of the asteroid and narrow down uncertainties in its orbit. The Space Mission Planning Advisory Group has also been alerted. They would propose any plan to intervene, perhaps by deflecting the asteroid with an intercepting spacecraft, a technique tested inNasa’s Dart mission.The asteroid is now hurtling away from Earth in almost a straight line making it hard for astronomers to determine its orbit with high accuracy. Astronomers aim to make more detailed observations over the coming months before the rock fades from view. If those measurements do not rule out an impact in 2032, the asteroid will probably remain on space agencies’ risk lists until it comes back into view in 2028.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This asteroid is of the scale that a mission like Dart could be effective, if required, so we have the technology and it has been tested.”Explore more on these topicsAsteroidsSpaceAstronomyNasanewsShareReuse this content"

He did not say how many contractors were already in Gaza.UG Solutions’ role in the ceasefire deal has been reported, but the email disclosed previously unknown details including the aim of recruiting 96 veterans exclusively with US special operations forces backgrounds, the pay and the types of weapons they will carry. Emirati officials had suggested the use of private contractors as part of a post-war peacekeeping force in Gaza, and that the idea had caused concern among Western nations.The deployment of armed US contractors in Gaza, where Hamas remains a potent force after 14 months of war, is unprecedented and poses the risk that Americans could be drawn into fighting as Donald Trump’s administration seeks to keep the Hamas-Israel conflict from reigniting.Among the risks facing the Americans are gunfights with Islamist militants or Palestinians angry over Washington’s support for Israel’s Gaza offensive.“Of course there is a threat they will face,” said Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official.The document said the contractors will be armed with M4 rifles, which are used by the Israeli and US militaries, and Glock pistols.The rules of engagement governing when UG Solutions personnel can open fire have been finalized, the spokesperson said, but he declined to disclose them.“We have the right to defend ourselves,” he said. He declined to discuss how the company won the contract.The Israeli deputy foreign minister, Sharren Haskel, on Tuesday told reporters, without naming UG Solutions or the United States, that Israel had demanded that the deal include the use of a private security firm, working with “an Egyptian security company or forces” to help maintain security and humanitarian aid flows in Gaza.But, she said, it remained to be seen if the arrangement “actually works”. Earlier rounds of ceasefire negotiations were held up by an Israeli demand to staff the checkpoint with its own troops.A Palestinian official close to the talks confirmed US contractors would also be at the checkpoint, at the intersection of the Netzarim Corridor dividing northern and southern Gaza and Salah al-Din Street, which separates the east and west of the enclave.The official said the US contractors would be deployed away from residents passing through and they must not deal with the local population.The UG Solutions email said its primary mission was “internal vehicle checkpoint management and vehicle inspection”.“We’re only focused on vehicles,” said the spokesperson.Israel mulls using private security contractors to deliver aid to GazaRead moreThe Israeli prime minister’s office declined to provide any further comment on the security arrangements. The US state department, Egypt’s foreign office and Hamas did not immediately respond to requests for comment. US use of private security firms has in the past led to disaster.In 2007, contractors for the now defunct Blackwater firm shot dead 14 civilians in Baghdad’s Al Nisour Square, igniting a diplomatic crisis and outraging Iraqis. Four Blackwater personnel were convicted in a US court and pardoned by Trump in his first term. Insurgents in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004 killed four Americans working for Blackwater and hung two of their bodies from a bridge, prompting a massiveUS militaryresponse.A separate source familiar with the deal said Israel and unnamed “Arab countries” that worked on the agreement are funding the consortium. The US government had no direct involvement in the decision to include a security company in the ceasefire deal or in the awarding of the contract, the source said.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warUS militaryIsraelEgyptMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

You know then how some people posing as democrats in 1933 abused the legal political process to get into power? What happened in the Bundestag on Wednesday reminded me ofGermanyin 1933 of how Hitler and the Nazi party managed to come to power through legitimate means.”View image in fullscreenAlbrecht Weinberg: ‘What happened in the Bundestag on Wednesday reminded me of Germany in 1933 of how Hitler and the Nazi party managed to come to power through legitimate means.’Photograph: Focke Strangmann/Getty ImagesWeinberg, who survived Auschwitz along with his brother and sister, said he had decided “very spontaneously” to hand back his medal “because I was very upset about the voting in the Bundestag”.On Wednesday, the conservative alliance of the Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) submitted a non-binding motion for a plan that aims to make it policy to turn migrants and asylum seekers away at the German border, and to enable security forces to more easily deport foreigners in Germany.Auschwitz: 80 years after its liberation, three survivors tell their storiesRead moreFriedrich Merz, the leader of the CDU and the man likely to become the next chancellor after elections later this month,was urged not to use the AfDto get the motion through by opposition members, who said it breached Germany’s longstanding taboo to keep a “firewall” between the far right and the mainstream.His decision was even criticised on Thursday by the former chancellor and CDU leader Angela Merkel who,in a rare interventioninto German politics, rebuked him for reneging on a promise not to cooperate, even “by accident”, with the AfD.Weinberg, who was given Germany’s highest honour for his work in schools raising awareness of the Holocaust, said he was shocked but not surprised by the motion.He said: “The Nazis wanted to get rid of my family even though we were German citizens, and they succeeded in murdering my parents and almost killed me and my siblings. Now these politicians want to chase everyone out who they don’t like. Did they learn nothing from the second world war? I really wonder whether I should be packing my suitcase again.”View image in fullscreenWeinberg sits inside his old classroom at the former Jewish school.Photograph: Focke Strangmann/Getty ImagesHe said he had already been chilled by the historical parallels he saw between the AfD’s tactics and those of the Nazi party after recent reports that the AfD had been distributingflyers designed to resemble plane tickets for deportationthat were addressed to “illegal immigrants”.“It reminded me precisely of how the SA [the paramilitary wing of the Nazi party] had printed small tickets at the local printing press and rang the bell of our house handing one to my father, a one-way ticket … telling him ‘don’t come back’,” he said.Weinberg, who grew up in the village of Fehndorf Rhauderfehn in East Frisia, northern Germany and will turn 100 in March, was forced into Nazi slave labour in 1939. He and his sister, Friedel, were sent to Auschwitz in April 1943 at the same time as, but separately from, their older brother, Dieter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “We’re friends. I called her because I was so disturbed – she said she’ll come and see me in a week or two to explain why. What can you do?”The photographer Luigi Toscano from Mannheim, a friend of Weinberg’s whose project Lest We Forget documented the stories of 400 survivors of the Holocaust, also said he was returning his order of merit. He was prepared to take Weinberg with him and hand it back to President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in Berlin personally, he said. “Either the president will receive us or we’ll throw the medals into his letterbox,” he told the broadcaster ARD.Wednesday’s vote came two days after a memorial at Auschwitz on the80th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death campin 1945.The vote led to criticism from all sides of the mainstream political spectrum. In a statement on her website, Merkel said she stood by her longstanding conviction that there should never be any association between the mainstream parties and the far-right populists.She wrote: “I think it is wrong to no longer feel bound to this proposal [Merz’s promise not to cooperate with the AfD], thereby allowing a majority with the votes of the AfD in a vote in the German Bundestag for the first time on 29 January 2025.”Eva Umlauf, 82, who survived Auschwitz and in 2015 told the Guardianthe story of how she was deported therewith her mother in 1944, also compared the vote to the situation in 1930s Germany.In a letter to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, she wrote: “We all know how German politicians once thought they could cooperate with Hitler and the Nazi party. Keep them in check. And how in just a few years, our democracy became a dictatorship.

Businessesinside the USandacross the worldhave warned of widespread disruption if the Trump administration pushes ahead.Trump repeatedly pledged on the campaign trail to use tariffs to revive the US economy, disregardingmany economists’ concernsthat imposing higher duties on goods from overseas would exacerbate inflation, rather than rapidly bring down prices, as the president has promised.‘We just can’t take the hit’: businesses worldwide brace as Trump threatens tariffsRead moreWhile the Trump campaign mooted a universal tariff on all foreign goods, the Trump administration has so far opted to target specific US trading partners. The president has made clear that China and the European Union are in his sights, but has so far focused on America’s closest neighbors.Weeks after his election victory last November, Trump announced on his own social network that upon his return to office he would “sign all necessary documents” to impose a 25% tariff onMexicoand Canada. Mexico must stop “illegal aliens” from crossing its border with the US, he said, and Canada must halt the flow of drugs like fentanyl. “Until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!”Trump did not, in fact, sign these documents following his inauguration. Instead, he introduced a deadline – 1 February – by which both countries are supposed to resolve his concerns.Asked about the deadline on Thursday, he said: “We may or may not. We’re going to make that determination probably tonight.”Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president, has alreadytaken Trump throughthe various migration initiatives her government has undertaken. Experts haveraised questionsover Trump’s demand from Canada, with so little fentanyl entering the US through its northern border that the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) omitted to even mention Canadain a 2020 report.Unswayed by such details, in recent weeks Trump has claimed his administration will raise “hundreds of billions of dollars, and even trillions of dollars” through tariffs that would boost the US economy. He has spoken ofestablishing an “external revenue service”to collect the money.While he and his allies continue to talk up tariffs as a viable financial revenue stream for the US, Trump – who as both politician and reality TV star has spoken highly of his dealmaking prowess – has previously raised them as a negotiating tactic, only to withdraw the threat.This strategy played out less than a week after his inauguration, when the White House threatened Colombia with tariffs and sanctions as punishment for its refusal to accept military flights carrying deportees.Colombia later agreed, and the threat was withdrawn.InCanada, ministers have expressed optimism that a resolution by Saturday remains possible. “I remain hopeful we’re going to be able to solve this. We’ve been doing it for 150 years together,” David McGuinty, the public safety minister, told reporters. “I don’t see why we can’t do it now.”Since Trump’s initial social media post about the Canadian border, officials in Ottawa have pledged to spend C$1.3bn for new measures, including the use of two Black Hawk helicopters and 60 drones.But it stands ready to hit back. A first round of retaliatory tariffs would cause minimal damage to the US, covering C$37bn of its exports to Canada, and if needed, Canada’s federal government plans to escalate by imposing tariffs on C$110bn worth of goods.Trump’s tariff plan will send prices ‘through the roof’, warn US firmsRead more“The reality is that a large, uncontrolled bully is using his position as the most powerful political leader in the world, to put pressure on a whole range of allies,” said Lawrence Herman, an international trade lawyer and senior fellow at the CD Howe Institute. “We have to, in Canada and the rest of the world, recognize that we’ve entered a new era.“With the Trump administration, there are no rules. There is no respect for international treaties or agreements. There is no longer value to the US signature on international documents.”In Mexico, meanwhile, the government has sent signals it is prepared to do more on migration and fentanyl trafficking – evennotching up a record seizure soon after Trump’s threats began– but it has also sought to play down the prospects of a trade war.“We don’t think [the tariffs] will happen. And if they do, we have our plan,” Sheinbaum said on Wednesday.“People are worried here, and there is a sense of uncertainty – which is what Donald Trump seeks to create,” said Kenneth Smith Ramos, Mexico’s former chief negotiator during talks over the USMCA free trade deal, struck between the US, Mexico and Canada during the first Trump administration.“It’s a bit like a game of chicken: the two cars are hurtling towards each other at top speed,” he said. “Mexico has to send the signal that its car is not a little one but a big one that could also hurt the United States.”Exports account for roughly 40% of Mexico’s gross domestic product (GDP), and more than 80% of them go to the US. While the country would try to diversify its export markets in the event of an economic dispute with the US, “you’re never going to be able to replace the US market with any other country”, said Smith Ramos.Ministers have stressed that “cool heads” are required in the face of Trump’s public threats and declined to disclose their plan of action if tariffs are imposed. “But you can be sure we have studied it a great deal,” Marcelo Ebrard, the Mexican economic secretary, said recently. “There will be no surprises, nor untimely reactions.”Have a question about tariffs?

The judge briefly called a recess so the prosecution and Relli’s lawyer could instruct him how to respond properly in court.A$AP Rocky trial: day ends with cliffhanger at moment of alleged gunfireRead moreBefore that could happen, Relli shouted, “You did this to yourself!” to Rocky, prompting an admonishment from the judge.“Do not talk to the defendant!” the judge, Mark Arnold, shouted at him.Relli grew frustrated by the questions asked by Rocky’s attorney. The defense showed screenshots of Relli’s Instagram posts in an attempt to contradict his earlier testimony that he had a positive relationship with Rocky before the shooting, but that he’d been so shunned for coming forward that his business was ruined and that he had no social media presence.Relli is suing Rocky’s defense attorney Joe Tacopina for libel in civil court for his public statements, and suing Rocky over the incident. The defense has sought to highlight the lawsuits in order to cast him as someone seeking money from a false story.In testimony in previous days, Relli has described the night in November 2021 when he and Rocky, their relationship straining, had a confrontation and scuffled on a Hollywood street, and Rocky pointed a gun at him before walking away.Relli testified that he was shouting at Rocky as he walked after him, then Rocky pulled the gun again and held it in the air.“He turned around and then it was like BOOM!” Relli told the jury. “The whole thing was like a movie, he kind of like pointed down and he shot the first shot.”He said he felt a burning on his hand where a bullet grazed it.Relli testified Rocky fired another shot that he didn’t see because he had hidden behind a mutual friend.He said, “I felt my hand hot,” and later added: “I was hit. Or I was grazed. I didn’t have a hole or nothing.”Rocky’s lawyer says the shots he fired were not even from a real gun – they were blanks from a starter pistol that he carried as a prop. The lawyer said Relli knew this, and that was why he was so fearless walking after him.“Oh it was a real gun,” Relli testified under prosecution questioning, saying he knew because of his scraped hand.Since the shooting and his decision to go to police and testify, he said he had received death threats, been shunned as a snitch and saw the modest music management career he built fall apart.“It’s been a living hell,” Relli said.About an hour after the shooting, Relli returned to the scene and said he photographed and recovered two shell casings. Earlier, while responding to a report of a shooting, police did not find any.He sent a text to Rocky that was shown in court saying: “U try killing me.”Rocky denied it in his reply: “Bro wtf is u talkin bout why u tell ppl I shot at u.”He sent Rocky photos of the shell casings and his grazed hand.Rocky said he was making stuff up and speaking “all type of nonsense” and was trying to “extort” him.The judge in the case ruled on Thursday morning that Relli’s social media posts capturing what seems like a luxury lifestyle after the incident would be fair game for questioning.Explore more on these topicsA$AP RockyRihannaUS crimeGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

All wrong.”She followed up by writing that it “is no longer a question of racism but social classes that feel threatened by each other”.Mexicans make Emilia Pérez parody poking fun at French stereotypesRead moreIn November 2020, she also wrote about “more and more Muslims in Spain” before adding: “Every time I go to pick up my daughter from school there are more women with their hair covered and their skirts down to their heels. Maybe next year instead of English we’ll have to teach Arabic.”In another post, she wrote: “Until we ban religions that go against European values and violate human rights, such asIslam, under the protection of freedom of worship, we will not end part of the huge problem we face. Faith manipulates those who cling to faith.”In a tweet from 2016, she also wrote: “Islam is becoming a hotbed for infection for humanity that urgently need to be cured.”In a post about the Oscars after the 2021 ceremony where Nomadland took home best picture, she wrote: “More and more the #Oscars are looking like a ceremony for independent and protest films, I didn’t know if I was watching an Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration or the 8M. Apart from that, an ugly, ugly gala.”Gascón, who shared the best actress prize at last year’s Cannes film festival with her co-stars, has since released a statement. “I want to acknowledge the conversation around my past social media posts that have caused hurt,” she said. “As someone in a marginalized community, I know this suffering all too well and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain. All my life I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness.”Netflix purchased the film at Cannes and has yet to comment.Gascón recently made headlines forcriticisingthe social media team involved with her fellow best actress Oscar nominee, I’m Still Here star Fernanda Torres. “I have never, at any point, said anything bad about Fernanda Torres or her movie,” she said in an interview. “However, there are people working with Fernanda Torres tearing me and Emilia Pérez down. That speaks more about their movie than mine.”She later clarified that it wasn’t meant to be an attack on Torres but on “toxicity and violent hate speech on social media”.Emilia Pérez has beennominated for 13 Oscars, a record for a film not in the English language, yet has faced criticism from both the LGBTQ+ community and in Mexico, where it is set. It tells the story of a cartel boss transitioning into a woman.Advocacy group Glaadcalledit “a profoundly retrograde portrayal of a trans woman” and that it represented “a step backward” for representation while the film has beenaccusedof perpetuating Mexican stereotypes.French director Jacques Audiard has sinceapologised: “If there are things that seem shocking in Emilia Pérez then I am sorry … Cinema doesn’t provide answers, it only asks questions.

Activists, celebrities and liberation advocates such as Nelson Mandela havecalled for his releasefor decades, citing railroaded justice and evidence of prosecutorial misconduct; the FBI and law enforcement, meanwhile, have campaigned vociferously against any commutation of his sentence.Short Bull (Lakota Nation vs the United States) and France began working on the documentary after Peltier had already served 45 years, as a new generation of activists worked to free the longest-serving political prisoner in the US. “If you’re Native American in the United States, you know the story of Leonard Peltier,” says activist Holly Cook Macarro (Red Lake Nation) at the film’s outset.‘They don’t want you to see the slave labor’: a new film goes inside Alabama’s prisonsRead moreThe 110-minute documentary underscores Peltier’s status as an icon of Native American independence and resistance, connected to more than half a century of Indigenous activism in the US, from the civil rights organizing of the American Indian Movement (AIM) in the 1960s, to the protests at Standing Rock in 2016, to the recent lobbying to free him. Peltier “fought for many of these things we’re direct beneficiaries of – cultural resurgence, Native American Freedom of Religion Act, Indian Self-Determination Act,” says Nick Tilsen (Oglala Lakota), founder of Indigenous-led civil rights group NDN Collective in the film. “It’s just been a part of the lexicon of being in the movement.”It seemed that the arc of the film would not end in change – Free Leonard Peltier captures some of a July 2024 hearing in which Peltier was once againdenied parole; the original finished version of the project ended with a clip from a 40-year-old interview with Peltier, who hasn’t been allowed to speak publicly since the 1990s, hoping that he would one day be released.But on 20 January, with 14 minutes remaining in his presidential term, Joe Bidencommuted his sentence, allowing Peltier to serve the remainder of his time in home confinement – and sending the documentary team scrambling to the edit room with a week until their premiere. The film now concludes with a highly emotional note of triumph, as activists hug and sob outside the federal correctional complex in Coleman, Florida.Notably, the commutation does not admit wrongdoing on behalf of the state. It will enable Peltier, who suffers from numerous health ailments, to “spend his remaining days in home confinement but will not pardon him for his underlying crimes”, according to aWhite House statement. The film outlines why, weaving a narrative of generational activism and miscarried justice that frames the shootout at Pine Ridge not as blow-for-blow escalation, as it was portrayed by mainstream media at the time, but as government incursion on to Indigenous land.View image in fullscreenJesse Short Bull and David France.Photograph: Todd Williamson/JanuaryImages/Rex/ShutterstockSeveral elders of AIM, founded in Minneapolis in 1968 by Dennis Banks and Clyde Bellecourt, appear in the documentary, attesting to the injustice of Peltier’s incarceration as well as the movement’s intentions. Forged by the civil rights protests of the 1960s, AIM targeted the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for its destruction of culture and identity through oppression and forced assimilation. “Trying to be an Indian is a daily struggle itself,” said Peltier in the 40-year-old interview excerpted in the film. “AIM was fighting back, all over the country. We were all living under the same type of oppression.”Peltier helped manage a weeklong occupation of the BIA office in 1972, as part of an effort to address the“Trail of Broken Treaties”, calling for the restoration of the treaty-making process, the legal recognition of existing treaties and the return of 110m acres of land, among other demands. At Pine Ridge, Peltier was defending against what many Native Americans saw as further theft of their land; the film suggests that the FBI was spying on residents and knew that AIM was shifting its focus toward mining practices in the area. The day of the shootout, Dick Wilson, the controversial tribal chairman with a private police force and ties to the federal government, signed away one-eighth of the reservation’s land.The shootout killed the FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams, as well as a Native American, Joe Stuntz. No action was taken over Stuntz’s death. Three Indigenous activists – Peltier, Robert Robideau and Dino Butler – were prosecuted for the agents’ deaths. Robideau and Butler were acquitted on the basis of self-defense. But Peltier was convicted, based on prosecution tactics that are “enough to make the authorities hang their head in shame”, says James Reynolds, a former US attorney who handled the prosecution and has since called for Peltier’s release, in the film.Sundance 2025: the 10 films not to miss at this year’s festivalRead moreNo one disputes that Peltier was shooting that day. The FBI has maintained the shootout represented a brazen attack on its agents, and that Peltier shot the agents execution style. The FBI director, Christopher Wray, personallyadvocated againstPeltier’s parole in July 2024, calling him a “remorseless killer who brutally murdered two of our own”. Peltier says he was nowhere near the agents and is being made a scapegoat. He has maintained his innocence, and refused to confess even though it would have helped his efforts at parole. “People know where my heart’s at. I’m not a cold-blooded killer,” he says in the film.Peltier’s imprisonment, perceived as injustice at the hands of a callous US government, continues to serve as a metaphor for many Native Americans. “Everything that’s happened to him is really a mirror for everything that’s happened to Indian people throughout history,” says Tilsen in the film.Peltier is not yet out of prison; he will be released 30 days after the commutation, on 18 February, at which point he should return to a new home at the Turtle Mountain Indian reservation in North Dakota. His liferemains in danger, according to advocates. But the film ends on a note of hard-earned hope – “we got through!” says Cook Macarro through tears. “He’s going home.”Free Leonard Peltier is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2025Documentary filmsSundance film festivalFestivalsIndigenous peoplesActivismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They will then be able to use a specially designed logo on book covers and promotional materials to show that their work has been created without AI.Human Authored “isn’t about rejecting technology – it’s about creating transparency, acknowledging the reader’s desire for human connection, and celebrating the uniquely human elements of storytelling,” chief executive Mary Rasenberger said in a statement. “Authors can still qualify if they use AI as a tool for spellchecking or research, but the certification connotes that the literary expression itself, with the unique human voice that every author brings to their writing, emanated from the human intellect.”Though currently only the guild’s members will be able to access the portal and use the logo on their work, the guild plans to patent the logo and open the system to non-members.Author and head of communications at the Institute for the Future of Work, Kester Brewin, opened his book God-Like: A 500-Year History of Artificial Intelligence with anAI transparency statement, laying out where AI had been used in the writing of his book. “Transparency about where and how AI has been used in written works in particular is absolutely fundamental to sustaining the trust relationship between writers and readers,” he said, calling the Authors Guild portal “encouraging”.There is no such scheme currently available to authors inBritain, although the UK’s Society of Authors (SoA), hasput together guidelinesto help its members protect their work from the impact of AI.The SoA also conducted a survey last year that foundmore than a third of translators had lost workdue to generative AI. In light of the survey, the UK’s largest trade union for writers, illustrators and translators, said that there is an “urgent need” for government regulation of AI tools to ensure they are developed and used “ethically and lawfully”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The Amazing James Brown (1961)If you want a roll call of James Brown’s formative influences, just check the covers on this album: Hank Ballard, Roy “Good Rockin’ Tonight” Brown, dirty blues supremo Bull Moose Jackson and Billy Ward’s impressively morbid The Bells, which – never knowingly understated – Brown used to perform on stage with a doll representing his lover’s corpse.19. James Brown Sings Raw Soul (1967)A classic 60s JB album, in that it carelessly throws together singles, tracks from random sessions and live tracks (the version of Tell Me That You Love Me is ludicrously intense). The difference here is the quality of the ragbag material: Bring It Up, Money Won’t Change You, Let Yourself Go, the effervescent sermonising of Don’t Be a Dropout.View image in fullscreenA fine 40 minutes.Photograph: Records/Alamy18. Slaughter’s Big Rip-Off (1973)Brown’s second Blaxploitation soundtrack isn’t a match for Black Caesar (below), often relying on transplanted or rewritten old material. You can see why the film’s producers were annoyed, but if you ignore its origins and simply take it as 40 minutes of music, it works just fine – and the opener, Slaughter Theme, is superb.17. Mutha’s Nature (1977)Brown’s disco years have been much maligned, not least by Brown himself. The standard line is that he ended up sounding like everyone else, which just isn’t true: the rhythms might have changed, but there’s a sweat-soaked rawness to Mutha’s Nature that resembles nothing else disco produced.16. Think! (1960)They say that if you’re going to buy a Brown album, you’re best served by a compilation, and that is particularly true of his early years. But not entirely. Aside from the hits, Think! has a lot to commend it, not least I Wonder When You’re Coming Home and You’ve Got the Power, both haunted by the ghost of doo-wop.15. Get Up Offa That Thing (1976)An album that lies somewhere between funk and disco, with a title track that temporarily reversed Brown’s commercial decline in the US. Quite rightly so: it’s fantastic, particularly in the full-length version here. Moreover, This Feeling, I Refuse to Lose and, especially, the frantic Can’t Take It With You run it close.14. It’s a New Day – Let a Man Come In (1970)The world could probably have lived without It’s a New Day’s thoughts on feminism – “a man can’t do nothin’ no more!” – although its groove is magnificently hypnotic. Elsewhere, there’s the peerless Give It Up or Turnit a Loose, a great remake of It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World and the fabulous, mid-tempo World.13. Black Caesar (1973)Usually a pioneer, Brown was a latecomer to Blaxploitation soundtracks, but had clearly noted the success of Isaac Hayes’ Shaft and Curtis Mayfield’s Super Fly. As with those albums, the music on Black Caesar outstripped the film it accompanied: check out Down and Out in New York City and Make It Good to Yourself.12. Hot Pants (1971)One thing the album format allowed Brown and his musicians to do was stretch out, something they were capable of without a hint of self-indulgence. Hot Pants offers just four tracks: the curiously titled Blues & Pants is a serious deep cut; while Escape-ism’s squealing horns later turned up on Public Enemy’s Don’t Believe the Hype.View image in fullscreenBrown at the Newport jazz festival, c1968.Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images11. I Can’t Stand Myself When You Touch Me (1968)Brown’s 60s studio albums were so wilfully patchy, it’s no wonder the occasional gem gets ignored, but I Can’t Stand It When You Touch Me is a relentless delight. The lesser-known tracks (the instrumental TheSoulof JB, the bizarrely produced stomper Time After Time) are as delightful as the big-hitting title track.10. Live at the Apollo, Volume II (1968)Live at the Apollo’s sequel captures Brown in a period of transition – what would come to be called funk is starting to stir. His band, the Famous Flames, sound as punchy as ever, but there is more space in the songs. Get the unedited deluxe edition, on which It’s A Man’s Man’s Man’s World lasts nearly 20 minutes.9. Soul on Top (1970)Proof that the Godfather’s albums were more than just addendums to his hits. Soul on Top is, if not a concept album, then certainly a conceptual one: an unexpected set of jazzy R&B recorded with Louie Bellson’s big band. Amazingly, it works – even the swing take on For Once in My Life, also recorded by Stevie Wonder a few years prior.8. There It Is (1972)When Brown began slowing down the rate at which he released albums, it led to an increase in their quality – here, even the evidently improvised slow-motion closer Never Can Say Goodbye is compellingly haunting. Point docked for includingtwospoken-word warnings about drugs – the sombre King Heroin and Public Enemy Number One, the two parts of which go on for what feels likemonths.7. It’s a Mother (1969)The tracklist suggests a hurried dance-craze cash-in; five songs have “popcorn” in the title. It might well have been recorded in a rush, but that works in It’s a Mother’s favour. A couple of ballads aside, the album feels like one ferocious extended jam, improvised on the spot, Brown barking orders to the musicians as much as singing.6. Revolution of the Mind: Live at the Apollo, Volume III (1971)Tom Waits described seeing Brown live as “like putting your finger in a light socket”, which fits the music here: the handbrake turns of the “fast medley” (three songs in 80 seconds!); the ferocious succession of tracks on side 4. And hats off for his rant against dieting: “The more you got, the more I want.”5. Say It Loud – I’m Black and I’m Proud (1969)As the 60s ended, Brown seemed to finally grasp that an album was more than a random collection of tracks. The title number is the draw here, but there’s a real flow to the rest. The ballads and instrumentals are too good to count as padding, and the slinky groove of Licking Stick – Licking Stick is obviously irresistible.View image in fullscreenGet thee behind me.Photograph: David Lichtneker/Alamy4. Hell (1974)At this point, Brown had started billing himself as the Minister of New New Super Heavy Funk. The Hell album’s My Thang reveals he wasn’t exaggerating. An abysmal, inexplicable cover of When the Saints Go Marching In aside, it’s all fantastic – plus the cartoon sleeve features Brown wrestling Satan and winning.3. Sex Machine (1970)Sex Machine saw Brown’s band, the JBs, at the height of their powers, supposedly captured live. Over half of the album patentlyisn’tlive, but given how awesome the extended takes of the title track and Mother Popcorn are – not to mention the thrillingly improbable transition from a version of If I Ruled the World into a warp-speed There Was a Time – is anyone really bothered?2. Live at the Apollo (1963)Brown’s label was dismissive of his idea for a live album, so the singer had to fund its recording himself. The result was an atmospheric, electrifying document of classic Chitlin’ Circuit soul, both raw and incredibly tight: a relentless, no-pauses barrage of songs, strafed with the audience’s screams and cries.1. The Payback (1973)Brown’s career was about to take a commercial dive, but you’d never guess from The Payback; nor would you guess that it was a rejected film soundtrack repurposed as a standalone double album that’s completely cohesive and immensely powerful. At least part of that power and cohesion comes from a shift in tone. In the midst of Watergate and a deepening recession, Brown’s messages of empowerment now seem underpinned by a noticeable impatience and anger. The softer songs have a bleak, despairing tone, suggesting that, whatever Forever Suffering and Doing the Best I Can present themselves as, they’re not necessarily just about affairs of the heart.Explore more on these topicsRankedJames BrownSoulfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Like the gamethat preceded it, Citizen Sleeper 2 is packed with evocative portrayals of everyday life in outer space, from farmers tending zero-G crops in an asteroid greenhouse to water miners rising up against the cartel that controls them, everyone eking out a meagre existence in crumbling space stations left to rot by a long-dead mega corporation.Once again you’re cast as a Sleeper, a robot with a digitised human mind shorn of the memories of the person it was copied from. In the first game you were on the run from the firm that made you, attempting to wean your robot off its reliance on a stabilising drug. In the sequel you play a different Sleeper who has successfully managed to ditch Stabilizer, but at the cost of being enslaved to a gang boss called Laine.Whereas before the action was confined to a single space station, Erlin’s Eye, the second game roves much more widely across a sector of space called the Belt. Your explosive escape from Laine sees you hot-footing it from station to station, with a timer signalling how close on your tail the gang lord is. In this opening section it’s a race against time to gather enough fuel and supplies for the next leg of your journey, all the while searching for a way to sever the mysterious link Laine seems to have with your body.Each destination offers a visual backdrop of wherever you happen to be visiting, whether it’s a long-abandoned space border crossing or a populated asteroid, but mostly you’ll be reading text descriptions of what’s going on and clicking through conversations. As in the previous game you have five dice that are rolled at the start of each day (or “cycle”), and these can be plugged into various activities at each location, with higher numbers delivering a higher chance of success.View image in fullscreenThe second game roves much more widely through different locations … Citizen Sleeper 2.Photograph: Jump Over The AgeBut now, the dice can break. On timed, high-stakes missions, failure accumulates stress, which in turn can damage your dice. If a die’s energy reaches zero, it’s broken, unable to be used until it’s repaired. If all five dice break on normal difficulty, your character gains a permanent glitch: a die that always gives an 80% chance of failure.You’re joined on these contracts by up to two crew members. Like in Mass Effect 2, you can gather crew for your ship, The Rig, and each comes with two dice that are attuned to their specialities. You can also use a “push” once per cycle, increasing the number on your lowest die at the cost of raising your stress. All of this makes contracts wonderfully tense and involving, as you decide how far to push your luck at the risk of outright failure. And failure stalks Citizen Sleeper 2: whereas many games promise power fantasies, here each day is a valiant struggle (at least at first). Some missions are locked off if you’re don’t get to them in time. It’s a game that encourages repeat plays, to see how things might have turned out differently.Citizen Sleeper 2 is around twice as big as the first game, with many more locations to visit. But this does mean it feels a little stretched thin compared with the previous title. Rather than getting to know one place intimately, we instead have a scattering of space stations with a handful of activities in each. The crew also feel underused: it’s a shame there isn’t a way to upgrade their abilities or integrate them more into gameplay.Yet the characters are also the game’s greatest strength, and throughout they are expertly drawn, both literally (with comic book artist Guillaume Singelin once again providing some gorgeous portraits) and in terms of their compelling and heartfelt backstories. Despite its bleakness, the world of Citizen Sleeper 2 is full of compassion, and it’s a joy to return to the universe Gareth Damian Martin has created.Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is out on 31 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsGamesRole playing gamesNintendo SwitchPlayStation 5XboxPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

The effects are cumulative, taking us on a journey that is filled with variety, tenderness and vulnerability, surprise and shock.Here is a man’s naked leg, foot planted on the floor. There’sWilliam Burroughs, lounging and insouciant,Susan Sontaglooking at the ceiling, a man and his dog sheathed in cellophane, like a gift you didn’t expect. A cow says hello over a fence. Caving in, door ajar, here’s a wrecked white shack, paint peeling and worn away, collapsed on its side in the New Jersey night, like a mendicant dropped exhausted on the way to somewhere else. And now a man on a chair, sucking his own big toe, an image that’s all strain and urge and beautiful contortion.View image in fullscreenPeter Hujar, Self-Portrait, 1980.Photograph: Courtesy of the Peter Hujar Archive/ARS, New York and Pace Gallery, © Peter Hujar ArchiveHujar’s photographs come at you one by one and all at once in a ravishing exhibition that dwells, mostly, on his work from the 1970s and 80s, right up to the time of his death in 1987, from Aids-related complications, at the age of 53. Focus shifts with every step.This show is overwhelming in its intensity, the swerves from subject to subject, from studied portraiture to sudden confrontation, from the studio to the world, from the bed to the church steps on Easter Sunday, and to the abandoned east side piers with their rotting spaces commandeered for sex and for impromptu art shows. Luminous sea mist clings to the corporate towers on Sixth Avenue and there’s a commotion on the quayside, a world of clamour and incident. Often Hujar would photograph all these things on a single day, Rolleiflex camera always in hand.Hung close, the images go by in speeding rows and runs. You come at them askance and face them one by one, and walk them with a slow, measured pace. They surprise and trap you in intimate situations and they run you down. Hujar’s work has a complex musicality. Then we’re on a late-night corner where there’s nothing but a fire hydrant buried in weeds. Further along the cobbled street a pallet and a tyre lean against a wall. Lit by the streetlights, the details look as deliberately placed as sculpture, leading the eye to a car mysteriously parked at a distant intersection. There’s no one there but us and whoever’s behind the lit windows high up and far off in a New York night that’s forever gone.My eye wanders in between things, returns and returns again. There’s such grace hereSome images are grouped in tight grids, filling your field of vision and sending your eye on restless, unexpected and bewildering journeys from subject to subject. The images are mostly square and mostly the same size and hung in matted white frames. There’s no colour, and Hujar was specific with his papers and his silver gelatin prints, all developed and printed in his apartment darkroom. However quick and sudden, or posed and calculated, the shot was, Hujar gave every image time, attending to their calibrated gradations of tonality. His work has tremendous formal rigour and sublety, and a clarity achieved as much in the darkroom as inside the camera.View image in fullscreenPeter Hujar: John Flowers (Backstage, Palm Casino Review), 1974.Photograph: © 2025 the Peter Hujar Archive / Artists Rights Society (ARS), NY, DACS London, Pace Gallery, NY, Fraenkel Gallery, SF, Maureen Paley, London, and Mai 36 Galerie, ZurichHow beautiful and miraculous and complex Hujar’s art is, taking us to open-casket funerals and the backstage corridors of aRobert Wilsonopera, where we meet a guy in fishnets and a gimp mask. We go from a field in Pennsylvania to a glade in Florida, where Hujar’s one-time lover, artist Paul Thek, lies under the trees like an animal encountered in the wild. Hujar explores the cruising grounds of the dilapidated East River piers to a space with nothing in it but a blanket folded on a straight-backed chair. He lovingly records scars on a man’s torso and an arid slag-heap, drawing the eye between the heaps of undifferentiated pewtery dross to a little piece of trash that catches the light. A horse stands patiently in a field, its flank a velvety near-black against a hill whose pale edge softens into an even paler sky, the image is an essay in gradation.Hujar, cigarette between his lips, looks at the camera and squints against the smoke. His self-portraits range from the casual to the studied. He sits naked and looks back at the lens with unfathomable knowingness. He goofs around and sticks a gnarly dildo inside himself. Here’s an ass shot, piss dribbling between his legs. Hujar’s candour demands our own. In 1976, he photographed dancer Bruce de Sainte Croix masturbating. We see the man standing, on his knees and seated. There’s emptiness all around him, an air of silent concentration and self-absorption. The dancer’s foot brushes the lower edge of the image and leads us in. His foot, his face, the shadows under the chair and the space around him are all as compelling as the act itself, stilled. My eye wanders in between things, returns and returns again. There’s such grace here.On one day that same year (1976), Hujar shot a series of photographs of the Hudson and East rivers, filling the frame with the slop and heave of the waters. In one, a trough in the swell becomes a sudden bowl of light. Elsewhere light skitters across the waves like errant scratches on the negative. Sunlight glances on a bubble, the lightest light in the photograph floating against a plummeting darkness that goes down and down. The depth and surface of vision are all there in these mesmeric studies.And then we come to Hujar dead in his hospital room (coincidentally, it is the same room where he had photographed transgender actor Candy Darling as she lay dying of lymphoma 13 years earlier, in 1974). Photographed three times by his artist friend David Wojnarowicz. First the head, then the hands, then Hujar’s bare feet, a harrowing sequence asking only for silence. Nearby hangs a 1985 portrait of Wojnarowicz, weirdly reminiscent of Phillip IV of Spain with his Habsburg jaw, like a Velásquez king in downtown disguise. An earlier 1981 portrait has Wojnarowicz with his fingers in front of his face, eyes downcast. What a quivering, pallid, vulnerable image this is, his forehead smudged with shadow, his fingers a defence against the camera. Past lovers, Wojnarowicz and Hujar shared an uncompromising attitude to art and life. More than that, their enduring friendship may also have been cemented by bonds of trauma and damaged childhoods.View image in fullscreenPeter Hujar: Stephen Varble (III), Soho, New York, 1976.Photograph: © 2025 the Peter Hujar Archive / Artists Rights Society (ARS), NY, DACS London, Pace Gallery, NY, Fraenkel Gallery, SF, Maureen Paley, London, and Mai 36 Galerie, ZurichWhenever you stop you’re on the brink of being swept away again, the pull of another image asking for attention. Even when they are funny Hujar’s images all have a certain gravity, and however quick and unguarded a shot might have been, however casual an image might appear, each photograph evidences Hujar’s meticulous, painstaking approach to his craft. For all his vexations – Hujar’s anger and intemperance and frustrations, his outbursts and volatility and depressions, his poverty and impossibility as a human being, none of this seems to get into his photographs. When you look at his work, all that falls away. Hujar’s unwillingness to compromise and his disdain for the market evidences a consummate discipline. He didn’t, or couldn’t, make things easy for himself.You have to hold on to the images so as not to get snared by backstories and circumstances and rumours and fantasies and all the baggage we carry around with us. His photographs are memorable even when we don’t think we have time for them. They arrest us and won’t let go.Peter Hujar: Eyes Open in the Dark is at Raven Row, London, until 6 AprilExplore more on these topicsArt and designPhotographyPeter HujarreviewsShareReuse this content"

The tribal intensity of extremely online and extremely sensitive fandoms can lead to either a mild torrent of more tolerable abuse or something far darker, like death threats and sometimes doxing, an unending rage erupting from people who use emojis as avatars. There’s a great thriller to be made about this unpleasant tension, the fans who will do anything for their idol and the idol who will do nothing to stop them, but Opus, a poppy new A24 misfire premiering at Sundance, is not that movie.Sorry, Baby review – a warm, bitingly funny refocus of the trauma plotRead moreIt’s the first film from the writer-director Mark Anthony Green, who, like many before him, is so fixated on what he wants to say that he hasn’t been able to figure out how to say it. There’s maybe a slicker, simpler and more satisfying murder mystery to be told here – an assortment of media types picked off one-by-one at the remote ranch of a reclusive pop star – but he’s challenged himself with something far harder and ultimately too far out of his reach.The pop star is Alfred Moretti (deliciously played by John Malkovich), who retreated from the public eye decades ago and has now returned with what he claims will be the greatest album ever made. In Willy Wonka style, he has invited a select few to his desert compound for an extravagant listening party – an influencer (Stephanie Suganami), a paparazzo (Melissa Chambers), a rock star turned podcaster (Mark Sivertsen), a TV show host (Juliette Lewis), a magazine editor (Murray Bartlett) and, in a surprise twist, his inexperienced junior writer Ariel (Ayo Edebiri). She’s felt a little hemmed in, pitching interviews that then are given to someone else, and is prepared to make the most of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Moretti has surrounded himself with a cult-like community of robe-wearing yes men who believe in teachings that prioritise creativity above all else, turning their idol into more of a god. Like many final girls before her, Ariel is convinced something more sinister is at play.Green, a former GQ editor, has created a thriller that’s a little too on-trend to ever truly distinguish himself. It’s The Menu meets Blink Twice meets Glass Onion meets Midsommar meets Nine Perfect Strangers meets A Murder at the End of the World – a film that’s so familiar that even if it had been well-crafted, it would still feel reheated. There’s a pull to the opening scenes though, as Ariel tries to propel herself at work while being reminded by a friend that given her lack of substantive life experience and relatively easy background, her failure to be at a more progressed professional place is down to her being “middle as fuck”. Green also intersperses snippets of real pop culture (cameos from Wolf Blitzer, Bill Burr and Lenny Kravitz), yet they’re lost in a world that quickly feels fake and unmoored, his overly lit, overly quirky visual aesthetic and logic-free escalation taking us out of what could and should have been an involving thriller.The music, created by Nile Rodgers and The-Dream, is unusually impressive, perhaps not quite enough to demand such a fervent following but certainly convincing enough. A magnetic Malkovich fully commits to the bit too, purring and prancing around while his descent into menace is believably modulated. But Edebiri, who can be an incredibly charming comedic presence, is left completely adrift. Her shuffling, in-the-notes performance works initially as an eager yet unsure junior writer but as the film starts to shift into darker genre territory, that same low-energy persona feels distractingly out of place. One never really feels the grand life-or-death stakes from her, mild nervous irritation when full-body fear is needed. It’s most glaring in a final, feeble confrontation with Malkovich where one can sense an unintentional added tension between someone who knows how to handle the material and someone who clearly doesn’t, the two acting as if in wildly different movies.Not that a better actor could have done that much more with such a gentle whisper of a character facing a genuinely what-the-hell finale of absurd, long-winded explanation-giving that still leaves us scratching our heads. The reveals make little to no sense – carnage that’s too sudden and scrappy for something so ritualistic, a plan that requires too many variables to be seen as viable, an allegedly “of the moment” motivation that’s contradicted by the actual moment – and Green seems more focused on “wouldn’t it be sick if …” shocks rather than a plot that holds together. So much of what transpires is maddeningly pretentious yet hopelessly half-sketched as well as being shoddily stitched together as if some major, up-all-night surgery was then required in the editing suite. For a film so high on its own devilish intellect, it’s all incredibly stupid.It’s frustrating to see yet another first-time film-maker overstack their plate in such a way that feels less like the product of impressive ambition and more empty bravado. Like the many films and shows it’s shamelessly, monotonously following, there’s a snappy sellable pitch but again, there’s just no thought-out follow-through and, given how bad this particular example is and isbeing received, one hopes we’re nearing the end of this torturous cycle.Opus is screening at theSundance film festivaland will be in US cinemas on 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsSundance 2025First look reviewHorror filmsJohn MalkovichSundance film festivalFestivalsComedy filmsJuliette LewisreviewsShareReuse this content"

I feel like the most boring fool on earth. I have no friendswho I can talk to. Social interaction is limited to small talk day to day – at work, with neighbours etc. I am unable to hold any meaningful conversation unless it revolves around kids, their shenanigans and how tired parents always are.My husband goes out with colleagues every week but I am rarely invited anywhere and I don’t think I want to be. I get terrified whenever I am. I’m sure that I add no value to any moment. I feel dejected and sad almost all the time. I can’t even read a book fully any more; I feel I don’t have any headspace left after attending to the boys all day. My husband holds an upper management position therefore he makes more money than me and spends longer hours at work, so I do about 90% of the parenting.I wasn’t always like this. There was a time when I used to be well read, funny, popular and overall great company. I don’t know if that girl exists any more but I wish she did and I wish I could touch that part of me again.Eleanor says:You say you’re sure you add no value, you feel dejected and sad all the time, you feel terrified when you get invited to things. That sounds horrible, and it sounds a great deal like depression and anxiety, which sounds as though it needs professional help. Please don’t think, “Sure, but what can I do without help?” Depression is one of the worst things that can happen to a person. If you feel this bad this often, something is badly wrong: feeling better matters more than a lot else on your to-do list, and the people around you should agree.Trying to resolve this level of consistent distress yourself is like driving around with the brakes cut, going “I don’t have time to see a mechanic”. Obviously, different people can afford different levels of care (in time and money), but whatever “highest priority for fixing” looks like in your family’s economic situation, that’s where “feeling better” should be. It really matters that you feel this bad.I want to find my ‘thing’. How can I work out what I want to do with my life? | Leading questionsRead moreLet’s take stock of what you’re dealing with. You’ve given birth twice. You parent two boys that take a lot of work. You work. You don’t have friends who make you feel like yourself again, you feel like people only relate to you as a parent or an acquaintance. Your husband doesn’t share the same saturation in the amount of parenting you do. In a way it would be shocking if youdidfeel like yourself, with your focus and identity and mood intact. Your body and time have been shared with other people, all day, for more than six years!You say you wish you could find that interesting “you” again. It’s such a tragedy of the expectation of cheerful parenting that so many mums feel this way, each one feeling alone. I hope there are some around you who can say, “Been there, Mama.”It’s going to be really hard to rediscover that part of you by mental exertion alone. Sometimes things have to change outside us for things to change inside us.In thinking about what might change, it’s worth paying attention to what we treat as fixed – and whether they reflect our deep priorities. You say you have to do 90% of the parenting because your husband works an upper management position and earns more money. OK, so that’s the fixed point: he stays in that job. Do you endorse treating that as fixed? The answer might well be “yes”, but it’s worth making sure that it is.Sometimes we forget to keep track. We think “I can’t do X because then Y would have to change”, over and over again. Then later in life we look at the list of things we treated as unchangeable – other people’s schedules, a particular job, an amount of money – and the list of what we sacrificed in exchange reads “happiness”, “what I wanted life to look like”. Whoops! Bad trade!Don’t treat things as too much to change unless they really are the priority. Especially if you’re sacrificing your own wellbeing in their name.You’re allowed to want to feel like yourself again. You’re especially allowed to ask for changes to help achieve that.The reader’s letter has been edited for lengthAsk Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleLeading questionsParents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But is their cosy revival driven purely by practicality, or something deeper?Chloe Mac DonnellThu 30 Jan 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 12.04 ESTShareThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Hej! Greetings from Copenhagen. I am in the Danish capital for fashion week, now regularly referred to as the “fifth fashion week” after New York, London, Milan and Paris – such is its influence in the industry and beyond.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.While some of the catwalk trends have divided opinion (not everyone is down for aballet flat/sneaker hybrid) on the streets, one item gets a firm yes: the bonnet. Yes, the head covering typically associated with newborns has been seen on everyone from the street-style set outside shows to the Danes queueing at bakeries for their morning buns. It’s not just in Denmark, either. The accessory is thriving and bumping beanies off the headgear charts in London and New York.One TikTok usersummed it up: “Brat summer, bonnet winter”.The most popular versions are knitted, and haveunder-chin straps. Some come with longer straps that can be tied into a large bow or tossed around the neck and worn like a scarf. There are some that sit tightly against the wearer’s scalp, while others are more relaxed. The more maximalist showgoers in Copenhagen have even been wearing versions adorned with sequins, feathers andtiny metal rings.Some wearers call them hoods, others refer to them as a balabonnet – a cross between a balaclava and a bonnet. On TikTok, tutorials on how to knit or crochet them are racking up thousands of views. Mette Wendelboe Okkels, the Danish knitwear designer and founder of PetiteKnit who created the viral mini Sophie scarf, is experiencing similar success withher bonnet pattern.View image in fullscreenClaret bonet, £145, Herd x Straw London.Photograph: James Halsall-FoxCloser to home, theBritish knitwear brand Herdhas collaborated with the homeware shop Straw London on a range, which come in matching baby sizes. The founder, Ruth Alice Rands, says Herds is on its fourth restock since launching it in December. Knitted withbluefaced Leicester wool with a deep rib and pointelle stitching, Rands credits their popularity to the silhouette. “It looks feminine without being too girly so, despite being called a bonnet, they have a broad appeal.”Elsewhere, Simone Rocha sells a padded and faux-fur-lined version (£364), while Urban Outfitters does cutesy ones with teddy-bear ears (£22). Three of the eight colour options fromRise & Fall’scashmere and merino wool version, for £79, are sold out.While these iterations are being lauded, the writer Nadeine Asbali points out that not every type of head covering gets such a warm welcome. She compares them to hijabs, a head covering worn in public by some Muslim women that covers the head and neck and which have become widely politicised. Last year, the French sprinter Sounkamba Syllawas told she would have to swap her hijab for a baseball capto participate in the Paris Olympics opening ceremony.As Asbali writes: “When is a head covering a controversial garment – even oppressive and patriarchal in the eyes of some – and when does it become fashion-forward and edgy?”Elsewhere, online some have tried to draw links between a surge in the popularity of bonnets toa wider movement against dressing for the male gaze, which is a response to backlash against women’s rights. Others compare them to the headpieces worn inThe Handmaid’s Tale. However, the fashion historian Amber Butchart thinks today’s versions are closer to balaclavas – an item with historical ties to the military. “During many past conflicts, women were encouraged to knit items such as balaclavas at home to send to the frontlines,” she says. “So it’s an item that has connotations of the battlefield – which feels apt in today’s divided political landscape – but also of providing care, warmth and comfort to others.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As one attendee in Copenhagen pointed out, the dual function of a bonnet is its ultimate appeal.

Dermatologists on 20 simple ways to love and protect your skinDo you need a complicated skincare routine, or is a cleanser enough? And what about sugar, sleep, stress and smoking?Sarah PhillipsThu 30 Jan 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 08.27 ESTShareOur skin is ever-changing and there is so much you can do to look after it – but when should you start using anti-ageing products? And should you ever squeeze a spot? From sunscreen to soap-dodging, dermatologists demystify skincare.Keep it simple“I tell my patients that their skin is a window into their general health,” says Dr Ophelia E Dadzie, a consultant dermatologist at Hillingdon hospital in Uxbridge and a specialist in skin of colour. “It is about going back to basics and keeping things simple,” Dadzie says. “This doesn’t mean spending lots of money on expensive skincare products. It is about proper nutrition, exercise, getting enough sleep, stress reduction and having a very basic skincare regime.”“As long as you cleanse properly after wearing makeup, moisturise if required and use sunscreen on a sunny day, for the vast majority of people, that is all they need to do,” says Dr Jean Ayer, a Cheshire-based dermatologist who is a senior lecturer at the University of Manchester.Children don’t need fancy productsDespite what TikTok would have you believe, children don’t need tostart using specialised products at the age of 10. “I see lots of very young people now who ask me about hyaluronic acid and retinoids,” says Ayer. “Pre-puberty, you don’t need to use anything.” If children are interested in skincare, she says, go for safe products such as a non-comedogenic moisturiser (meaning it won’t clog or block pores) and micellar water.For those who have eczema, a different approach may be necessary. As Dadzie explains: “For children with skin conditions, it is important that they understand their own skincare regime and why it is needed.”If your acne is bad, seek helpMost people develop spots during puberty, and sometimes later in life. “About 80% of the population will have acne to some degree,” says Ayer. This is when you need to give more thought to what you are putting on your skin. “Use something that is oil-free, like benzoyl peroxide. This dries out the areas of skin that are producing too much oil.” If over-the-counter products aren’t helping, or if you are getting scarring, go to the GP, saysDr Bav Shergill, a consultant dermatologist in Sussex. “GPs are very competent at dealing with the majority of acne,” he says. If the products they prescribe don’t work, you will be quickly escalated to see a specialist. Give products a good amount of time to see if they are effective before switching to something else, but no more than three months, says Ayer.Don’t start using anti-ageing products too youngView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sergey Mironov/Getty Images“There is a school of thought,” says Ayer, “that if you start doing things earlier, then perhaps you will prevent the effects of ageing as you get older. I don’t think there is enough data to support that one way or another. If I was going back to my 20s, I would still keep it really simple, using as little as possible, and a really good sunscreen.”When you start using anti-ageing products depends on your skin type, says Shergill, “along with how much sun exposure you have, and what you are trying to achieve. If we are talking about preventives, you could, from the age of 25 or 30, have a bit of base retinol in your products. I didn’t start to care too much about it then, but I think men are different: we age about 10 years later than women. Because of the menopause changes, women in their 40s lose collagen, so they can get signs of ageing at that time.”Know the ingredients worth paying out for – or not“The ingredients that have data that supports their use are retinoids,” says Ayer. “For older skin, I would use a retinoid, sunscreen and a good moisturiser. Inexpensive products are often just as effective as products at a higher price point.” However, she adds, “the data to support most anti-ageing products is often limited to small studies and therefore has to be interpreted with caution. Hyaluronic acid, for example, is an ingredient that is talked about a lot. But its molecules are quite big, so for it to penetrate through the skin would be almost impossible. When people say it is really good for hydration, actually all it is doing is sitting on top of the skin, stopping water from leaving, rather than rehydrating it.”“Eye and neck creams overpromise,” says Dr Emma Wedgeworth, a dermatologist who runs a clinic in Harley Street in central London. “There is a limit to how much you can freshen up the skin in these places, because the change is underlying.”Try new products with cautionDadzie recommends doing a patch test to check if a product suits you or will cause irritation. “When you have darker skin, you are at risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, so you need to be very careful.”“A lot of people think that retinol irritates their skin, and it can cause dryness,” says Shergill. “Use a light amount, maybe two to three times a week, and then slowly build it up. When you’re in a dry environment, over winter, you may need to go back to using retinol twice a week to avoid irritation.”Don’t squeeze spotsSqueezing spots can cause problems, says Wedgeworth: “Excess manipulation of spots is associated with scarring. So I would leave it, or use a spot sticker with salicylic acid in it. If you are getting regular spots, you need to put something in place to try to prevent them: we are much better at preventing spots than we are at treating them.”“Often, when you wash your face,” says Shergill, “if the spot is ready to go it will just discharge itself. But you shouldn’t need to pick it out.” Benzoyl peroxide or niacinamide, an anti-inflammatory agent, are the best things to put on a spot, he advises.Wear sunscreenView image in fullscreenAllow sun cream to dry on the skin, rather than rubbing it in.Photograph: Catherine Falls Commercial/Getty Images“If you look after your skin when you are young and use an effective sunscreen, you will reduce your chances of skin cancer when you are older. You will also look better, because it is one of the very few things that objectively prevents sunlight-induced ageing,” says Ayer. If you live in the UK, have sun cream ready to go in March in case of an unexpectedly sunny day. Shergill keeps one bottle at the front door and another at the back, so it is easy to apply before going out.“If you want to maximise everything you can to prevent changes like ageing and pigmentation, there is definitely a rationale for using sunscreen every day,” says Wedgeworth. “Make sure the expiration date hasn’t passed,” adds Shergill.It usually lasts for a year after being opened, but consult the label.Use the highest SPF possible“I always advocate an SPF of 50 or above,” says Ayer. “This is because the amount of sunscreen we actually apply to our skin is considerably less than what they test in the lab. If you apply 25% of the lab-tested amount of a factor 50, “then you are still going to get a reasonable amount of benefit from using that. But the lower you drop that SPF, the less benefit you have. In terms of skin types, if you are very fair-skinned and burn easily, the SPF (sun protection factor against UVB, which causes burning) is particularly important. For those with darker skin, what becomes more relevant is the star rating (protection against UVA), which is responsible for the effects of sunlight-induced ageing. The SPF should still be high, too.”The experts: dentists on 22 quick, easy ways to care for your teethRead moreApply a cream, not a spray, every two hours“While sprays are very easy to put on, you will never get the level of coverage you actually require,” says Ayer. “When you put a cream on, you don’t want to rub it into the skin: allow it to dry into the skin, because rubbing it can decrease the efficacy. For people who are very high-risk, put a layer on, wait for 15 minutes and then reapply. Even if it says it lasts all day, our experience tells us this is seldom the case, so put some more on after two hours.” If you go in the water, reapply when you get out.Cover up in the sun“You cannot get better than protective clothing,” says Ayer. “Wide-brimmed hats are amazing, and you can get UPF clothing that has protection built-in.” Shergill lives near the sea and his kids always wear a rash vest when they are out in the sun: “It’s the culture here.” Normal clothes do provide protection to a point, Ayer says. She suggests you take your clothing and hold it up to the sun. “If you can see the sunlight through it, that means you are getting a bit of UV radiation through it. If you are very sensitive to sunlight, although it may seem counterintuitive, wear dark colours and a tightly woven fabric in the sun.” And in case you hadn’t guessed, “tanning machines are a complete no-no”, says Dadzie.But don’t forget, sunlight is good for us“There is a balance to be had, because we do need sunlight,” says Ayer. “Sunlight is essentially the only way that we generate vitamin D, so for most people supplements are a good idea.The British Skin Foundation recommendsthat most people with lighter skin types need 10-15 minutes of daily sun exposure to get sufficient levels of vitamin D in the UK, and people with darker skin need 25-40 minutes. If you are an easy burner, go out in the early morning or later in the evening, and then you get a little bit of sunlight exposure with a reduced UV index.”Keep an eye on molesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: urbazon/Getty Images“Moles are small, coloured spots on the skin, often dictated by your skin type and genetics. For most people, they are entirely normal,” says Ayer. “It is common to continue to develop moles into your late 30s. If you start developing new moles after that age, unless they are warts, they may need a GP or dermatologist to check them out.”“Only one in three melanomas [skin cancers] come from a pre-existing mole,” says Shergill. “Having said that, if you have got a mole and it starts getting bigger, or the edges get blurry, or it is a funny shape, so not symmetrical, and it’s getting darker or lighter – those are the things that you need to watch out for.” These signs of changes are referred to asABCDE, which stands for asymmetrical, border, colour, diameter, evolving. “If you are not quite sure about a mole, go and talk to a doctor about it. It will take someone who is trained a few seconds to tell you whether it is normal or abnormal,” says Ayer.It is not just moles that can be problematic: also watch out for rapidly growing, often skin-coloured lumps, or a spot that hasn’t healed after several weeks and is on a sun-exposed site, says Shergill. “Any suspected skin cancer should be removed as soon as possible to prevent it spreading internally. Tumours are removed surgically, usually under a local anaesthetic, and the diagnosis confirmed. Sometimes further surgery and non-surgical treatment is required to get the best cure rates.”Keep on top of skin changes elsewhere“Our poor body skin gets completely neglected,” says Wedgeworth. “One of the main things that I am really careful about is the type of cleanser that I use on my body. We tend to see people using quite a lot of harsh products, and in the winter months you end up with dry, flaky skin. This needs to be treated or it can become problematic. We see this a lot with hands in the winter.”“If things aren’t looking great, do get them checked out,” says Shergill. “Don’t be embarrassed and hide it away. It could be an early warning for something quite nasty that could be going on inside.”Ditch the soap and fragrancesWhat about washing with a good old-fashioned bar of soap? “I try to avoid soap,” says Ayer. “It can be very drying due to chemicals in the fragrance or sodium lauryl sulfate. There are good soaps with very little in them, but most tend to have some form of fragrance” – because we associate being clean with having a nice smell.You are what you eatView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Yagi Studio/Getty Images“If you stay away fromexcess consumption of ultra-processed foodsand try to have a healthy, varied diet, it may have a good impact on skin health,” says Ayer. “The data is limited supporting the consumption of collagen or other supplements and their improvement on skin health.” Shergill aims to eat 30 different plants a week, as perZoe guidance. “I focus on polyphenols, like black olives and spinach,” says Dadzie. She also chooses wholewheat pasta and oily fish over processed foods and too much meat.Does sugar cause spots? Dadzie says, “I haven’t reviewed the evidence specifically on this, but in broad terms, we know that sugar causes inflammation in our bodies, so we should minimise it. I’m no angel; I do have a sweet tooth. My tip is to go for dark chocolate – it doesn’t taste as nice, so you don’t tend to eat as much.”Sleep well and manage stress“There have been some very interesting studies that demonstrate the effects of lack of sleep and increased stress on the skin,” says Ayer. “I see it time and time again: people’s skin often deteriorates during periods of stress. Sleep is beneficial for everything, and also impacts on stress.”Don’t smoke“After excess sun, smoking is one of the most problematic things you can do for your skin,” says Wedgeworth. “It impacts on blood flow to your skin: wound healing is worse with smokers, and it can cause accelerated ageing. The jury’s out on vaping, but I personally would not vape.”Stay hydrated – but don’t go over the top“We get asked this a lot,” says Shergill. “You don’t have to be chugging two and a half litres a day. You’re going to get a lot of your fluids from other foodstuffs. As long as you are urinating regularly, and it is not super-concentrated and you haven’t got a headache, you don’t need to be overly concerned about it.”Use clean flannels and pat, don’t rubShergill gives the green light to flannels, “as long as it isn’t a really manky one that’s been around for ages. You can get a mild exfoliation with it. Towel drying is OK, except if you’ve got things like eczema: if you rub, it sets off the eczema.” The trick with towels is to “pat yourself dry. It doesn’t matter if your skin is slightly moist after you come out of the shower; you can still apply a moisturiser to it.”“I don’t think flannels or muslins are necessary,” says Wedgeworth. “Hands and a towel are absolutely fine.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Diving in a frozen lake at night – below ice, beneath the stars, at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres? What an absurd idea.An hour ago, I was inside a tiny mountain refuge beside Lac Robert drinking tea, the temperature outside dropping by the second. Now, I’m outdoors and zipped into a cumbersome drysuit (designed to prevent water from entering), with blue latex gauntlets sealed at the wrists and a black frogman hood wrenched over my head.View image in fullscreenDivers camp the night surrounded by 2,500-metre peaks.Photograph: Mike MacEacheranIce diving as a niche activity took off in the 1990s, offering an alternative adventure for thrill-seekers on their ski holidays. It’s available in two other French mountain resorts, Tignes and Val-Cenis. But here, above the village of Chamrousse where I’m staying, ice diving school Dive Xtreme has launched the region’s most intense, magical, low-impact thrill yet: a night dive in a frozen mountain lake, followed by a starlit night’s camping on its frozen surface amid 2,500-metre peaks.I shiver. I look like a cosmonaut. I feel like packaged hamForget cold water swimming. This is the equivalent of taking the plunge under the north pole. The appeal, for me, is to get out of my comfort zone and experience what the instructors behind the idea, 25-year-old Thibault Dassieu and Tanguy Chamard, 30, describe as a chance to “connect both outwards to the wonders of the high-altitude landscape and inwards to the adventurer hidden within us all”.As I wait in the deep snow, weight belts are slung over each shoulder and a heavy scuba tank lifted on to my back. Then a full-face respirator mask is strapped on tight. A gasket on my survival suit is opened, the air rattles out, everything tightens around me and the diving suit sticks to my skin. I shiver. I look like a cosmonaut; I feel like packaged ham.View image in fullscreen‘Unlike regular diving, where scuba divers aim to float horizontally, the technique under ice is to remain vertical.’Photograph: Hemis/AlamyThe lake feels wild and secret, but it’s only a cable car and chairlift ride from Chamrousse, 20 miles south of Grenoble in Isère. The tiny resort in the Belledonne massif styles itself as an easily accessible base camp for micro-adventures and offers skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling, as well as short dog-sledding trips – and now ice diving.Anyone can have a go – no experience is necessary, though divers must be at least 140cm tall and eight years old (the oldest so far was an 83-year-old grandmother). I’ve dived a few times, but this feels completely different – an opportunity to connect with nature in its rawest form. Looking down into the two metre-wide hole (cleft anew with an axe every morning), I take one last jolt of breath then we’re into the icy soup. Tanguy, all jokes and smiles, is relaxed. Me, nervous, almost paralysed. A pink line rips along the snow-covered horizon. “Now you’ll see why I’m addicted to this,” he says. As we vanish below, the world feels put on pause.The first myth about ice diving is that it’s achingly cold. But with the lake temperature at around 1C, the surface is far colder and it feels like slithering into a tepid bath, though one with a snow-covered crust of metre-thick ice and an infused glow from the hazy surface torchlight.The second is that it is risky. “When you scuba dive in the ocean, the danger is the depth,” says Thibault. “In Lac Robert, we’re a maximum distance of five metres from the ice and here the biggest issue is getting lost. This lake isn’t big enough – so it’s impossible.” A guide rope helps ease any panic, as do two additional emergency exits out of the ice. Fear remains though: some divers feel claustrophobic, others disoriented.View image in fullscreenThe 10-minute circuit of the frozen lake is perfectly safe – there is a guide rope and two additional emergency exits out of the ice.Photograph: Chloé HalotThe gateway ice hole is a trap door into another realm. At first, I struggle to gain my buoyancy. Unlike regular diving, where scuba divers aim to float horizontally, the technique under ice is to remain vertical, with flippers pointed down and arms free to discover the rink above. The imperative is to empty all the air out of the drysuit. Otherwise, a jack-in-the-box bob results in a bump to the head.We kick our flippers and our 10-minute loop around the lake begins. Lines of dimly lit ice curve away from me and through my mask I make out ribs of iced fissures and mutated crystals. In places the submarine ice has begun to thaw. Shapes appear and my mind stretches.Time slows in this magical, watery world. A miniature tornado of loose ice spins and scatters into luminous shards and bubblesTanguy turns entertainer as my eyes adapt to the dark. He lays a hand on the shelf above us and, as if by magic, passes me a torchlit sliver as part of a surreal, silent show-and-tell. Immediately it slips from my grasp, falling, spinning, fading into the abyss. He exhales deeply from his regulator; the result is an arc of bubbles that disperse and dance through my torch’s beam. Eerie, lurking crackles pop from above, echoing in the blackness.View image in fullscreenThe director of DiveXtreme clears ice to create a ‘skylight’.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyTime slows in this magical, watery world. Tanguy twirls an index finger like a cocktail stirrer and a miniature tornado of loose ice spins and scatters into luminous shards and bubbles. I’m mesmerised. I feel I could hang out here for hours, but all too soon the dive ends and I am hauled back on to the snow by Thibault and an anchor rope. Now I look like a cosmonaut, but feel like a rescued whale.That night, dried, changed, and our equipment defrosting in the refuge, Tanguy cooks fondue outside on a picnic table and the lake is transformed by the Milky Way. White wine is passed around. The pan of cheese is quickly emptied. Woolly hats are pulled down tight.View image in fullscreenInside the refuge.Photograph: Mike MacEacheranEventually the stove is blown out. Soft snow begins to fall. I tread through the drifts to my tent on the lake. It is secured by threaded ice screws and snow-packed at the sides. I crawl into a down sleeping bag, the mountain silence interrupted by wind and what I imagine are burbles of ice and belching water below. The irony is a broken, restless sleep follows. I am too hot.Around 7am, a thin mist creeps into the lake eyrie and croissants and coffee are served in the refuge where the instructors have slept. We wait for the chairlift tostart the journey back to the village, via the Croix de Chamrousse summit at 2,250m, chatting about our mad but memorable evening.It’s one of those rare moments in life, I say, that seem to transcend the ordinary. When it’s possible to feel suspended, as if between life and death, all while haloed in a strangely brilliant glow cast from above. The pair nod. The mountain gods may have given them a frozen lake, but they have filled it with an adventure that feels almost not of this earth.The trip was provided byAlpes Isère.

Photographs byDavid LeveneThu 30 Jan 2025 08.26 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 10.01 ESTShareAs the sun set on thesangam,the sacred meeting point of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers on Tuesday, there was a mood of jubilation on the banks. This was the eve of one of the holiest days of theKumbh Melafestival – the largest religious gathering not only in India but the world – and millions upon millions had made long, often arduous journeys to immerse themselves in the water.“It seems like the entire country has come to thesangamto bathe,” exclaimed Rubi Kumar, 43, sandwiched tightly with fellow devotees on the riverbank. She had taken a 36-hour train from her home state of Bihar, and then walked 25 miles to reach this spot. Still dripping wet from her first holy dip, she beamed widely as she tied up her soft pink sari.View image in fullscreenPilgrims bathe at the banks of the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers on MondayView image in fullscreenPeople sleep on plastic sheeting and under blankets out in the open“It was such a struggle to get here but now it feels like all the pain and agony has gone,” said Kumar. “It’s one of the most beautiful days of my life.” She planned to take one more dip at about 3am the next morning – the most auspicious time, on Wednesday – and then head hundreds of miles back home.Kumbh Mela: what is the Hindu ‘festival of festivals’?Read moreThe potent belief among the Hindu devotees gathering that evening was that to be cleansed in thesangamwaters over the next few hours – a period known asMauni Amavasya,marking a new moon – was to free their body of past sins and relinquish the endless cycle of birth and death. Some wept as they entered the freezing river, while others shouted out in euphoria or whispered prayers as they scattered flowers and poured cups of milk into the holy waters.The Kumbh Mela comes round just once every 12 years in the Uttar Pradesh city of Prayagraj, but this year was deemed particularly special as it was the “Maha” or great Kumbh Mela, marking the 12th in a row, which comes just once every 144 years amid a special alignment of the sun, moon, Jupiter and Saturn. By the government’s own projections, 400 million people are expected to attend by the time it finishes in February, the largest crowd in its history.View image in fullscreenPilgrims cross the River Ganges using one of 30-odd pontoon bridges in PrayagrajView image in fullscreenPilgrims bathe at sunrise on TuesdayIt had taken 45-year-old Vipul Rajgor and six members of his family 14 hours to drive through the night from Gujarat to be here, but he was nothing short of overwhelmed at the experience. “To be alive and here for this day is the greatest gift of my life,” said Rajor.Nearby, families sat spread out in a colourful mass across the ground, passing around rotis and chai,and birds swooped over the small fishing boats taking devotees out for a gentle evening river ride. Gayatri Devi Kushwa, 30, said the sacred water was icy cold as she dipped in with her five-year-old son, Deepanshu, “but it felt incredibly peaceful. I never wanted to get out.”View image in fullscreenAn ambulance rushes from the scene of the crowd crushView image in fullscreenManoj Kumar Paswan holds up a picture of his aunt, who he lost in the crushYet within just a few hours, these joyous scenes would turn into a deadly human crush. As darkness fell over the vast makeshift camp on Tuesday evening, more and more devotees poured into the festival site to bathe at thesangamduringMauni Amavasya. People squashed into the square kilometre of land known as the “sangamnose”, trying to reach the riverbank with increasing desperation.View image in fullscreenMounted police attempt to control crowds at a bottleneck at Maha Kumbh MelaView image in fullscreenPolice on guard as pilgrims continue to stream towards the banks of the river, near to where dozens were feared deadBy nightfall, messages were broadcast from loudspeakers telling devotees to only take two dips – “a third dip is a sin” – and then leave the area immediately. Police began to usher families sitting by the river to take their holy bath early and then move on.Many present at the scene said what unfolded next was “inevitable”. It was after 1am, as people poured in from several directions, that chaos and confusion took over and bathers going to the river collided with those returning. Barriers erected by police were pushed over and people began to panic, trying to shove their way out.View image in fullscreenRelatives of dead and injured people wait outside a makeshift hospital reserved for the Kumbh Mela festival, with an image of Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, in the backgroundView image in fullscreenFamilies wait for news at the makeshift hospitalThose stuck in the swelling press of bodies described sudden surges that pushed people to the ground, where they were trodden beneath thousands of feet, and many found themselves unable to get back up. Families sitting on the floor, many with small children fast asleep, were separated or crushed beneath the surging mass. Baljeet Singh, whose wife, Mira, died after she was pulled from his hand, told Indian media: “There was no way we could save ourselves.”View image in fullscreenSaroj Bhagri lost her grandson in the crush: ‘I have lost my eight-year-old grandson, Chahat Bhagri. We arrived yesterday night and went for a bath in the river late in the night. We were sitting near the river afterwards having some food.

By the time the scene had been cleared over an hour later by police and paramilitaries, dozens of bodies lay strewn on the riverbank and the wails of injured people could be heard alongside the ring of ambulance sirens. Detritus of the tragedy, including lost shoes and muddied shawls, lay scattered across the sacred banks.Uttar Pradesh police said nearly 18 hours later that the crowd crush had cost the lives of at least 30 devotees and injured at least 60 others. But as dozens of families gathered desperately outside the hospital morgue looking for those lost in the crush, many questioned whether the true death toll was higher.View image in fullscreenPolice cordon off areas in order to try to manage the crowdsThe Kumbh Mela is seen by the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) as a compelling symbol of Hindu unity and power that aligns neatly with their Hindu nationalist political agenda, and the party invested vast resources in putting on and publicising this year’s festival – attracting large numbers of pilgrims. The most visible face at the festival, beaming down every 200 metres from posters and cutouts like that of a high priest, was of prime ministerNarendra Modi.“The Kumbh Mela has become a huge PR exercise for the government,” said Dinesh Giri, a high priest of one of the Hindu monastic sects, known asakharas, who form the spiritual centrepiece of the festival. “Hindus who would never have come before are coming in huge numbers because it’s all over the media and online. Everyone wants to come and take selfies at the Kumbh Mela.”View image in fullscreenA woman who had two family members injured in the crush recounts her story to the media outside the temporary hospitalOn Wednesday, as the state government refused to officially confirm the number of those killed, they were still keenly releasing hourly updates of visitor numbers taking a “royal dip”, which they claimed had hit 76 million by the end of the day.Fears of another crowd crush meant the local train station was closed on Thursday morning. Yet even beneath the cloud of tragedy, the Kumbh Mela festivities continued uninterrupted. The next morning at thesangam, bathers continued to arrive unfazed, though many families stayed tethered together with string. “Nothing could keep me away,” said one 49-year-old pilgrim, Muni Bhai, as he dipped beneath the water.Additional reporting by Aakash HassanExplore more on these topicsKumbh MelaIndiaHinduismSouth and central AsiaReligionNarendra ModinewsShareReuse this content"

In doing so, they’ve redirected the US public’s attention toward their “shock and awe” tactics that led to thousands of arrestsacross the countryin less than a week.But as all eyes turn to these high-profile enforcement efforts, the new administration from its very first moments has also been relentlessly, if more quietly, targeting people trying to come to the US legally, systematically dismantling safety nets meant to protect the world’s most vulnerable individuals and families, who are already suffering because of it.Some of the programs that Trump has quickly scrapped are legacy systems that have long enjoyed bipartisan support; others are Biden-era innovations intended to provide a more orderly alternative to those risking their lives to slipacross the desertor throughthe Rio Grande.The Biden administration’s approach was deeplyflawedand ofteninhumanein so manyaspectsyet it now seems startlingly reasonable and compassionate by comparison. All of those legal pathways are in effect gone, at least for now – and their demise has left many thousands of people who followed US government guidance stranded, hopeless and in danger.The first to go was the federal government’s CBP One phone app. Almost as soon as Trump was sworn into office, officials shut off the app’s capabilities for immigrants and asylum seekers to schedule appointments and enter the United States with legal permission. Around30,000 peoplewith existing appointments lost them, even thoughsome were already standingat the US-Mexico border, ready to cross.Next came a flurry of restrictions through Trump’s day one executive orders. Asylum at the US’s borderswas categorically banned. Privatesponsorship programsthat allowed everyday Americans to financially support at-risk people and bring them to the USwere terminated, or at leastput on ice. And the US’s celebrated resettlement program, where highly-vetted refugees come to the US for a fresh start,was suspendedfor months … maybe indefinitely.As a result, more than10,000 refugeeshad their scheduled travel to the US cancelled. Those already stateside and waiting for reunification with family memberswere shockedwhen their loved ones were no longer permitted to come. And, egregiously,Afghansfleeing Taliban rule – including unaccompanied children – were once again abandoned by the federal government, just as they had been during the US’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.Soon after, resettlement agenciesreceived the newsthat they were to halt their federally funded services, such as job support and housing assistance, that help refugees already in the US successfully acclimate. Likewise, the Department of Justice ordered legal service providersto stopgiving immigrants and asylum seekers in detention or at court even the most basic legal support on the federal government’s dime. One of theprogramsthat was shut down had helped children to retain counsel, so they didn’t have to represent themselves in sometimes life-or-death proceedings.At the same time, immigration enforcement authoritieshavethe green light to process people who entered legally through CBP One or some of the private sponsorship programs for a fast-tracked deportation where they may never even go in front of a judge, seemingly ignoring their ongoing legal protections to live and work in this country.Yet another solution that’s now defunct: Biden’sSafe Mobility Offices. To keep people from just turning up at the US-Mexico border, federal officials had worked with Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Guatemala to mount an initiative in South and Central America that both educated would-be immigrants about the legal pathways available to them and approved people who were eligible for travel onward to the US.It was one of the fewtruly successful programsthat the previous administration created through its carrot-and-stick approach toward global migration.That approach had been twofold – create options like the Safe Mobility Offices, CBP One, or private sponsorship for people to arrive legally in the US, then punish those who didn’t use them. Trump, by contrast, has adopted a more singular strategy: keep everyone out, and especially those who need help.Under the US government’s new outlook, the question does not seem to be whether people are coming legally. Is the question becoming, instead, simply who can afford to become American? Who has the right skin color to become American? Who is already privileged enough to become American?Increasingly for those who don’t fit the bill, there is no “right way” to come. Trump and his allies are making sure of that.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS-Mexico borderJoe BidenBiden administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

He is also joined, occasionally, by dolphins and whales, curious about his white and orange vessel. But now Méndez fears his family’s way of life and livelihood are under threat.View image in fullscreenFrancisco Méndez has been a fisher for 22 years, but fears his livelihood is now under threatRenowned for itsgreen energy credentialsthat see it generatingup to 98% of its electricity from renewables,Uruguayis changing tack and ramping up its search for oil in its territorial waters.Uruguay’s new “black gold” rush has its roots in development more than 7,000km (4,300 miles) away. While the South American country has never found oil on or offshore, its former neighbour Namibia – from when the continents were joined as part of Pangaea –recently did.In 2022, the south-west African country discovered11bn barrels of oil off its coast, raising the possibility of similar reserves in Uruguay and leading to a stampede of international oil companies descending on Montevideo.“We have a very similar geology, very similar spaces,” says Santiago Ferro Castelli, energy transition manager atstate-owned energy company Ancap, which is overseeing the exploration.View image in fullscreenThe state-owned energy company Ancap estimates as many as 30bn barrels of oil could be found off of Uruguay’s coast.Photograph: Harriet BarberSeven contracts have been awarded to some of the biggest energy companies in the world to begin oil and gas prospecting. Seismic data acquisition is expected to begin this year, and drilling will begin in 2026. This marks the first time all 120,000 sq km (46,000 sq miles) of Uruguay’s offshore acreage is under active contracts.Ancap estimates there is a3 to 23% probabilitythat areasoff its coast will contain oil or gas, and says as much as 30bn barrels could be found.Uruguay’s late entry into the oil game comes amid a greater race across Latin America and the Caribbean. As the Guardianreported last year, about half of the region’s countries are involved in about 50 major new oil and gas projects. Production is expected to outstrip demand, adding 2m barrels a day destined for export by 2030.The push comes despite the global drive to achieve net zero and a warning from theInternational Energy Agencythat exploration and development ofnew oil and gas fields must end immediatelyif the world wants to stay within the safe limits of the climate crisis.A map showing which areas of Uruguay's waters have been licensed to oil companiesNot all of those in Uruguay’s government are positive about the plans. Gerardo Amarilla, undersecretary at the environment ministry, believes his country’s exploration is a “complete contradiction of climate change goals”. “It is inconsistent to continue searching for oil or diesel at a time when the world is making a commitment to abandon fossil fuels,” he says.One Uruguayan academic, who wishes to remain anonymous, says that while countries in the global north can argue they “did not know” about subsequent climate effects when they produced emissions for centuries, countries exploiting today “cannot claim the same ignorance”.On the shores of Uruguay, fears are also mounting about what the plans could mean for marine life.View image in fullscreenExploration operations have begun to determine if there is crude oil in the sea off of Uruguay.Photograph: Courtesy of El ObservadorThe seismic acquisition involves air guns firing into the sea from large vesselsevery four to 10 seconds, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, until surveys are completed. The blasts create loud sound waves that can penetrate more than 10km beneath the seafloor and, in the open ocean, be detectedthousands of kilometres from the source.Companies use the results to produce detailed 3D maps, allowing them to define targets for exploratory wells and tap potential reserves if hydrocarbons are discovered.Environmental researchers say theprocess is dangerousfor marine species and can lead to habitat abandonment, the disruption of mating and feeding, and beach strandings. It can also damage animals’ hearing and communication ability, cause the displacement of fish populations, and kill large numbers of zooplankton, a crucial marine food resource.View image in fullscreenAndrés Milessi, marine biologist, says Uruguay lacks experience or laws around hydrocarbon exploitation.Photograph: Harriet Barber“It will affect all forms of marine life, from the smallest creatures to our whales,” saysAndrés Milessi, a marine biologist of 30 years and director ofMar Azul, a project of the non-governmental organisation Che Wirapitá. Uruguayan waters are rich in biodiversity and home to a great number of creatures, including sperm whales, sea turtles, dolphins and seals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has not happened since they stopped,” he says.It was also during this earlier testing that fishers reported a huge drop in catch. “Our catches dropped 42% in the year after,” says Juan Riva-Zucchelli, the director of the Chamber of Fisheries.Méndez says new seismic exploration and drilling plans will be a “nail in the coffin” for the area’s abundant marine life and artisanal fishing communities, whichalso suffer from illegal fishing. The fisher recalls that, during this period, he constantly had to find new areas to fish, five to 10 nautical miles away from his usual spot.“It was terrible for us,” he says. “To be in the sea, to be in nature, is everything. If they go ahead, the fish will die, and those that don’t die will leave. My whole family are fishers. It will kill all our livelihoods.”View image in fullscreenA protest by Greenpeace activists in front of a seismic ship off the coast of Montevideo, Uruguay.Photograph: Martin Katz/GreenpeaceUruguayans also fear their country entering uncharted territory and question their preparedness if oil is found.Uruguay’s green power revolution: rapid shift to wind shows the world how it’s doneRead more“Uruguay has no history in hydrocarbon exploitation. So, obviously, we don’t have legislation or laws either,” says Milessi, adding that during previous explorations companies “took advantage”, complying with only “the minimum requirements”.Another point of contention is Uruguay’s position as a leader in clean energy. The country has essentially accomplished the transition other nations are striving for.More than 90% of Uruguay’s energy needs aremet by low-carbon sources, and the country exports its surplus energy to neighbouring Brazil and Argentina. Uruguay has also been working toward its long-term green hydrogen goals.“Our people have not chosen to be an extractivist country. There wasn’t the opportunity to vote,” says Milessi, who believes Uruguay would benefit more from protecting the ocean and prioritising a blue agenda.View image in fullscreenFishing boats in Punta del Diablo on the east coast. Local people fear that seismic exploration and drilling plans will destroy fish populations.Photograph: Harriet BarberAncap argues that, even though Uruguay is not reliant on fossil fuels, other countries are, so finding oil and gas could boost the economy. “Finding them could be a source of income, and that could be important for the country,” says Ferro.Such an offer would not go unheeded. Despite being one of the wealthiest countries in Latin America, Uruguay, with a population of 3.4 million, faces problems with thecost of living, education and poverty.About half of childrenfinish higher secondary school,and one in five childrenand adolescents live in poverty. Uruguay’s prison system is in crisis, with the 13th-highestprison populationin the world.“People here still believe climate change is a problem for the future,” says the academic. “For now, the government is trying to keep quiet about the oil exploration – most people don’t even know about it. But if they discover the oil, then they will promote it, saying the money will be used for education and hospitals. It’s like putting a cake in the entrance of a school and telling the children you can’t eat it.”The environment ministry is conducting a study on the environmental impacts and will arrange a public hearing once it has concluded. It adds that companies must meet strict requirements if prospecting begins.Pablo Gristo, head of exploration and production at Ancap, says the company is adopting the “most stringent guidelines and protocols” regarding oil exploration and remains “fully on board” with promoting energy transition projects.The local fishers, however, who say they have not yet been informed about the proposals, fear their prospects are bleak.“The artisanal fisher is disappearing; we are already in the extinction zone,” says Pablo Acosta, a third-generation fisher in La Paloma, a small coastal town. “The businessmen have already stripped the land of the animals. And now they are going to strip the sea.”Explore more on these topicsThe Latin oil rushUruguayFishOil (Business)Oil (Environment)Fossil fuelsGreenhouse gas emissionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It really has developed and changed considerably.“And yet, we know without doubt, that the vast majority of girls and women who are sexually assaulted will not report to the police and do not want to go through our criminal justice system.”Australian parliament still unsafe, Mark Butler says, after rape and stalking among 30 serious allegations reported to HR bodyRead moreThe numbers tell the story–Australia’s criminal justice system is failing victim-survivors of sexual assault.Whileone in five womenover the age of 15 has been sexually assaulted in their lifetime,almost 90% will not report to police. Of the women who do make a report, only a quarter will see their perpetrator charged. And even fewer will see their perpetrator plead guilty or be convicted. From decade to decade, the numbers don’t shift.According to Victoria’s Sentencing Advisory Council, there were23,000 reports of rape to police between 2010 and 2019but only 1,000 sentencings for rape offences. More recent data from New South Wales shows there were 9,138 sexual assaultsreported to policein 2022 but only 1,016 convictions.After the #MeToo movement revealed the staggering prevalence of sexual violence, after the March4Justice women’s marches that swept across Australia in 2021, the reality is that justice for victims remains elusive within the criminal justice system.For the past year, the federal government’s Australian Law Reform Commission has been conducting a review into justice responses into sexual violence, and the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, will soon table his report, addressing both outcomes of cases and the treatment of victim-survivors.View image in fullscreen‘The vast majority of girls and women who are sexually assaulted will not report to the police and do not want to go through our criminal justice system,’ says Jennifer Coate, acting chair of the Victoria Law Reform Commission.Photograph: Clair MacDougall/The GuardianMichael Bradley, managing partner of law firm Marque Lawyers, has represented hundreds of sexual violence survivors and chairs the Rape and Sexual Assault Research and Advocacy Initiative. He says under Australia’s criminal justice system “rape is effectively decriminalised”.“If you look at the probability someone’s going to report to police, the probability police will prosecute, the probability someone is going to be convicted and punished for that rape – it’s somewhere south of 1%. That is negligible,” he says.“Your chances of actually facing consequences for committing rape are almost nonexistent and that is by design. And if we are all comfortable with that, then cool, let’s stick with what we’ve got. But I’m not.”A two-yearlandmark inquiry by the VLRCinto the criminal justice system’s response to sexual offences, released in 2021, found most women will not come forward with their experience of sexual assault because they do not want to go through a criminal trial or because they fear they will not be believed. (Research suggests thatno more than 5%of all reported allegations are false).For those who end up going through the process, the inquiry found most sought validation rather than retribution – they wanted to have their story believed and heard.Instead, many come out more traumatised than they were when they went into it. As Dreyfus said in a statement: “All too often, seeking justice adds to the trauma experienced by victims and survivors.”In many cases, this is because the very principles that uphold the criminal justice system inhibit the delivery of justice to sexual assault victims. As a result, many academics and advocates, including Bradley, are calling for a complete overhaul of the system .‘A criminal justice system, not a victim justice system’The structure and ideology of our criminal justice system comes from another time; back to William the Conqueror, the first Norman King of England.In previous centuries offenders were madeto compensate victims to avoid blood feuds and private prosecutions were commonplace, saysMichael O’Connell, South Australia’s inaugural commissioner for victims’ rights. But under William I, crime came to be considered a disruption to the “King’s Peace”. Rather than injuring the victim, crime produced a “debt to the state”, he says.The concept continued to evolve until the 19th century when, O’Connell says, the “bureaucratisation of the criminal justice system was complete”, via the creation of a police force and public prosecutions.The right to silence doesn’t work because it dips the scales entirely in the defendant’s favour.Since then, the justice system has largely remained unchanged.“This is the criminal justice system that Australia inherited on colonisation. It remains a criminal justice system, not a victim justice system,” O’Connell says.The former police officer says Australia’s adversarial system lives up to its name as it largely plays out like a “dispute” between two sides – the Crown, or prosecutor, and the defence. Victims are rendered “witnesses to a crime against the state and are almost entirely excluded from the criminal justice process, except when they are needed to testify”.Dr Kerstin Braun, a senior lecturer in law at University of Southern Queensland, says the prosecutor does not represent the victim. Rather, they represent the Crown – the reigning king or queen – and serve the court and the public interest.This can create a conflict between the victim and the prosecutor because their interests – and legal obligations – do not always align, she says.For example, prosecutors are required to hand over all relevant materials to the defence – even if it is not in the victim’s best interest or is favourable to the defendant.More than 20% of Australians aged 18 to 45 have committed sexual violence in adulthood, report showsRead more“This can really come as a shock to victims, who go into the criminal justice process with this common misconception, probably based on television shows, that the prosecutor is their lawyer,” Braun says.“Prosecutors are not the victim’s legal representative and, while they will try to also represent their interests, they are not their representative in the way a defence lawyer is to a defendant.”‘Of course, she goes on trial’A cornerstone of the criminal justice system is that a jury must be convinced “beyond a reasonable doubt” that a crime has occurred. But in sexual assault cases, this can be a near impossible standard to reach.The prosecution holds the “burden of proof”, meaning it is their job to prove a sexual assault occurred. In most jurisdictions, this requires proving two key points: that the victim did not consent, and that the perpetrator also did not reasonably believe they were consenting.This can be difficult, given sexual assault is usually committed by offenders known to the victim and in the absence of witnesses or physical evidence.It usually means a complainant will need to give evidence and be cross examined. They may also be required to hand over their phone, social media accounts and text messages, to be examined by both prosecutors and the defence. The defence can also request the victim’s counselling notes and other confidential records.The accused has a right to a fair trial, a right to silence, and a presumption of innocence. They are not required to take the stand and, in the majority of cases, they don’t.Bradley says the measures are in place to protect a defendant from wrongful conviction, based on a concept called Blackstone’s ratio, named after the English jurist William Blackstone who in the 1760s wrote: “It is better that 10 guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.” (This argument can be traced further back, to the 15th century when Sir John Fortescue, chief justice at the time of Henry IV, maintained that it was better that the guilty escape than the innocent be punished.)View image in fullscreenMarque Lawyers’ Michael Bradley, who has represented hundreds of sexual violence survivors, says the probability someone will be convicted for rape is ‘negligible’.Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianBut he says that in cases of sexual assault the right to silence “doesn’t work” because it “dips the scales entirely in the defendant’s favour”.“What it means is that when you get to trial the only evidence the court hears is that of the victim and so, of course, she goes on trial,” he says.“That’s compounded by the fact that the prosecution has to prove not just the act but the absence of consent, and the only way they can prove that is through her. For the defence, the quickest way to raise doubt is to raise doubts about consent.”A Victorian defence lawyer, who asked for anonymity so they could speak freely, agreed.“You kind of have to put the victim on trial. You’ve got to make the jury doubt them.”Rape myths, re-traumatisation and reformsCreating doubt in cases of sexual assault is not especially difficult because society’s attitudes and understanding of the crime have changed very little over time. Stereotypes about how victims of sexual violence are supposed to behave, as well as “rape myths”, continue to feature in courtrooms around Australia, shifting the blame from the perpetrator to the victim.Equal access to justice is a foundational principle of Australia’s legal system – but it’s not the reality in country towns | Gabrielle ChanRead moreAs part of the 2021 review, the VLRC commissioned Prof Julia Quilter from the University of Wollongong and Prof Luke McNamara from the University of New South Wales to analyse the transcripts of 25 rape trials in the county court of Victoria from 2013 to 2020.Despite the introduction in 2017 ofjury directions reformsin Victoria – which gave judges the power to instruct jurors that victims may not be able to recall all the details of an offence and describe it consistently every time – Quilter and McNamarafound that in most trials there was deliberate use of cross-examination questions to confuse or “shake” the complainant’s account.Misconceptions also featured, including suggestions that a complainant was lying because they delayed in reporting the sexual assault. (The majority of victims who experience rape and sexual offences delay disclosing). All trials included evidence of the complainant or the accused being intoxicated at the time of the alleged rape. Lines of questioning also “inferred consent to later sexual activity” based on the complainants’ clothing, or “flirtatious” behaviour.Another analysis of trial transcripts by Quilter and McNamara of NSW cases – thelargest analysis of sexual offence trial transcripts in the statein almost three decades – found the majority of complainants were accused of lying and fabricating the event for an ulterior motive. (The study, incorporating 75 cases, was conducted between 2014 and 2020, before NSW introduced new jury directions on consent and trauma.)More than half were cross-examined for having failed to verbally communicate non-consent or failing to physically resist, while more than three-quarters were cross-examined for having an incomplete or inconsistent recall of events. Research showsthat victims are more likely to freeze and cooperate rather than fight off the offender, and trauma impacts a person’s recall.Despite the 2017 reforms in Victoria , the 2021 VLRC review recommended introducing more juror directions and that they be given at the earliest opportunity and repeated at any time during the trial.The recommendation was acted upon by the government in 2022, with a series of additional directions legislated, including that a person can be not consenting to a sexual act even if they are not threatened with physical violence or they do not protest or resist. A person can also not be consenting even if they had slept with the person in the past, went to their home or acted in a way that is “perceived to be flirtatious or sexual”.NSW’s law reform commission also made almost the same recommendations in 2020, and new jury directions and consent laws came into effect in 2022.However, Coate notes it will be difficult to assess the impact of the directions because it is prohibited in Australia to speak to jurors after they make their decision.Experts such as Mary Iliadis, an associate professor of criminology at Deakin University and co-convener of the Deakin Network Against Gendered Violence, argue that the use of rape myths and the interrogation of complainants lead to significant re-traumatisation of victims, which have long-lasting impacts.“This is a problem when we consider that the integrity of the criminal justice system also rests on victims’ confidence that the reporting of crime will not cause further harm or worsen existing harm,” she says.Iliadis says the safety of the community is also at risk if victims are unwilling to go through the legal process.In light of these structural issues, experts have suggested reforms.Law reform commissions in NSW and Victoria have called for the use of independent experts to address topics such as how memory works and why victims may display counterintuitive behaviours after a sexual assault, such as maintaining a relationship with the accused.Some submissions to the ALRC are calling for a more radical rethink, such as the Queensland Sexual Assault Network, which has suggested the introduction of a“civil approach” to sexual assault cases, where an accused would be held to the “on the balance of probabilities” standard of proof and required to take the stand.In last year’s defamation action brought by Bruce Lehrmann over rape allegations broadcast by Network Ten it was found by Justice Michael Lee that on the balance of probabilities Lehrmann raped Brittany Higgins. Lehrmann denies the allegation and is appealing that decision.They also suggest that “bad character” evidence relating to a defendant, such as the fact that they are a heavy drinker or use illicit drugs, could be admitted to trial in some circumstances, as well as inconsistent statements they have made.However, such changes have been met with scepticism by the Law Council of Australia, the body that represents all state and territory bar associations and law societies, which warns against “undermin[ing] key safeguards of the criminal justice system”.View image in fullscreenVolumes of Australian laws in the office of Jennifer Coate, the acting chair of the Victoria Law Reform Commission.Photograph: Clair MacDougall/The Guardian“The presumption of innocence, the right to silence, the right to a trial by jury, the burden of proof resting on the prosecution, and the criminal standard of proof (beyond reasonable doubt) are all essential to the integrity of the criminal justice system,” its submission to the ALRC inquiry read.This view was shared by criminal defence lawyers who spoke to Guardian Australia.“We’re talking about an outcome that could lead to someone being put in jail, that is no small thing,” one says.“The burden has to be on the state – the state has all the power, the money, the resources. They have to be able to prove it without any help from the defence. To shift the dial on that would be to completely alter the system.”Another lawyer says the introduction of affirmative consent laws in NSW, Victoria and the ACT in the past few years, which emphasise that consent to sexual activity should be actively communicated and cannot be assumed based on silence, had “helped to even the scales”.“That is a major, yet relatively new change. I don’t think we’re yet to see it fully play out,” they say.Legal representation for victimsBradley says despite reforms, such as the broadly welcomed introduction of affirmative consent laws,the adversarial criminal justice system remains “ill adapted” to handle the nuance involved in sexual assault cases.“The criminal justice system applies a strict binary to some very complex situations. It says either you’re guilty – and you’re the worst person in the world and you need to be jailed. Or you’re not guilty – and she’s a liar and you’ve done nothing wrong, forget this ever happened,” Bradley says.“It completely forecloses any possibility of the guy who’s been accused of committing a rape admitting he’s done anything wrong, because the consequences of admitting it are catastrophic.”It has led him to see restorative justice as a possible approach for some sexual assault cases, because it would allow perpetrators to genuinely participatein a process that could provide the victim with some closure.Restorative justice, which has widespread support from police, prosecutors, courts, victim advocates, criminal barristers and the VLRC, and is already in place in the Australian Capital Territory, brings together victims of crime and perpetrators in a facilitated environment, guided by trained professionals and with the support of counsellors.Victims can explain the impact of the perpetrators’ offending, while the perpetrator is supported to take responsibility, apologise and make amends – in most cases without legal ramifications.Braun and Illiadis, however, say the only way victims will be given equity and a genuine role in the system is via the introduction of their own legal representation.Illiadis says the concept takes inspiration from the inquisitorial legal systems in countries such as Germany, where victims of serious violent crime are afforded the status of “secondary prosecutor”. They can engage lawyers to represent them, make submissions, cross-examine the accused and make a closing argument. In Denmark and Sweden, victims of sexual offences can engage a lawyer from as early as when they decide to report to police.But there is resistance to the idea of victims’ lawyers within legal circles and at the VLRC.Coate says while victims should be provided their own legal representation at particular points in the process, such as confidential communications applications, it would “create problems in the trial process rather than solutions”. The inquiry instead recommended they be provided with a “victim’s advocate” to support them through the process.The inquiry also recommended lawyers receive special accreditation and training to appear in sexual offence cases, which would be accompanied by higher fees, in an effort to attract the best people to the work.But Braun says such tinkering around the edges of the criminal justice system is not enough.“We’ve been talking about this issue – how we can improve the situation for victims of sexual offences – for 50 years,” she says.“You can play around with the current structures of the adversarial system – and we have – but it hasn’t really changed much.“It’s time we try something else.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In Australia, support is available at1800Respect(1800 737 732). In the UK,Rape Crisisoffers support on 0808 500 2222. In the US,Rainnoffers support on 800-656-4673.

Undocumented parents have been signing powers of attorney to ease custody issues if they are detained and separated from their children. Business owners are deputizing employees to take care of their affairs if anything happens.But in other ways, the city has been buzzing with action. Know Your Rights workshops taking place at community centers, local parks and union meetings across the city have been packed with participants. A network of local advocates has been coordinating to track operations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents, and connect the families of those detained with legal aid.Immigration raids in Chicago begin days after ‘border czar’ claimed officials were ‘reconsidering’Read more“The administration wants to instill in all of us fear tactics. They want to paralyze us. They want to make us immobilized by this moment,” said US representative Delia Ramirez at a press conference at Chicago’s Malcolm X College on Wednesday. “But what does the community and the state of Illinois do when we are under attack? We stand up and we fight back, folks.”Chicago had been bracing for raids for months, ever sinceDonald Trumpwon the election and signalled he would be enacting his campaign promise of “mass deportations” as soon as he took office. In advance of inauguration, reports were already circulating that the city would be an early target.Since then, Ice, the largest branch of the Department of Homeland Security, announced that it would be conducting “enhanced targeted operations” in Chicago along with several other federal agencies, including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency and the US Marshals service. The Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, said the raids could target up to 2,000 people in the city.The scale of the raids, which are targeting people all across the region, has been chilling, said Tovia Siegel, the director of organizing and leadership at the Resurrection Project, an advocacy group that provides legal aid and community education for immigrants.“It’s causing really significant fear, and it’s causing people not to leave the house, not to want to go to work or bring their kids to school,” she said.Agents have been primarily apprehending people at their homes, Siegel said. Officers in unmarked vehicles and those wearing the insignia of various federal agencies have confused people, she said. “We’re seeing children who are terrified their parents are not going to be there when they get home from school.”Trump and his appointees have emphasised that the raids are targeting criminals, but people with and without criminal histories have been apprehended so far.“It’s being articulated that there’s a prioritization of dealing with criminals, but the impact is wider,” said Kwame Raoul, Illinois’s attorney general, who has been an outspoken critic of Trump’s immigration orders and is one of several Democratic attorney generals suing the administration over its efforts to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented people.US citizens and legal residents are being swept up in the raids, Raoul said, “whether intended or as unintended consequences of racial profiling”.Adding to the unease is the administration’s decision to lift a longstanding ban on immigration raids in schools, churches and hospitals. Late last week, Chicago public schools officials announced that they had spotted immigration agents at Hamline elementary school in the city’s south-west side. It later became clear that the officers were from the Secret Service, and were not conducting immigration enforcement. But the incident has nonetheless continued to unnerve parents and educatorsIn Chicago’s ward 25, which encompasses Pilsen and is made up of many immigrants, Alderman Byron Sigcho-Lopez said that right after the Secret Service incident, attendance at high schools had declined by at least a third, and attendance was even lower at elementary schools. In Chicago’s Brighton Park neighborhood and Little Village, home to many Mexican American and other immigrant families, neighborhood associations who run afterschool programs said they noticed significant drops in attendance.An uneasy quiet in US cities amid immigration crackdown: ‘There’s a shift’Read moreAt the Lincoln United Methodist church in Chicago’s Pilsen neighborhood, where about three-quarters of residents are Mexican American, the Spanish-language Sunday service is now being held over Zoom so that congregants of all immigration statuses can safely attend. “We haven’t done this since the beginning of the pandemic,” said the church’s pastor Emma Lozano, who’s a longtime immigration advocate. “Back then we felt it would be temporary. We were waiting for the vaccine, for medicine.”This time around, she said, she’s not sure how long her congregants will have to worship virtually. “We’re all just trying to figure out how long this is going to last – and what’s the medicine for this?” Lozano’s church has long been a refuge for migrants. In 2006, it drew national attention when the activist Elvira Arellano took refuge and resisted arrest there for months along with her young son, and churches around the US joined a sanctuary movement in solidarity.But now, the city has come into theTrump administration’s crosshairs – and Lozano is shaken. The church has ramped up its security protocols, making sure the door is locked behind the kids coming in for the evening capoeira classes. Lozano said she herself has felt rattled, and worried about her safety and threats from Trump supporters.Social media videos and televised broadcasts of immigration agents battering down people’s front doors or raidsattended by the television psychologist Dr Phil, have pained her, she said. “It’s almost like lynchings,” she said. “There’s a perversion and some kind of pleasure they’re getting from terrorizing this population of immigrants.”To many activists, the administration’s activities in Chicago did not come as a surprise. The city, which has been a sanctuary for immigrants since 1985, has long drawn the ire of immigration hardliners and conservative politicians. Its sanctuary status was first ordered by mayor Harold Washington, who prohibited city officials from cooperating with federal immigration agents, and required that city services were provided to all residents regardless of their immigration status. The order was eventually passed into law, and then weakened by mayors over the years. Chicago’s current mayor, Brandon Johnson, has vowed to fiercely defend his city’s immigrants. On Wednesday, congressional Republicans called on him to testify at a hearing on sanctuary cities.In the past two years, the state of Texas has bussed thousands of people – mostly from Venezuela – to the city and its suburbs, including during the dead of winter. Now, both the recent arrivals and people who have been living in the city for years without documentation have been on high alert, and advocates are straining to make sense of why and how people are being targeted.For Yess Gómez, who has been living in Chicago for two decades, the raids have brought back a familiar anxiety – but also a defiance. “We are afraid, but fear hasn’t paralyzed us,” said Gómez, who has been involved in Chicago’s immigrant rights movement for many years. “My kids don’t deserve to see their mother hiding. And I’m not going to do it.” Instead, she has been preparing.The Guardian is not publishing Gómez’s full surname to protect her from retaliation. She has a work permit as part of a program that delays deportations for workers who have witnessed or experienced workplace abuse, and works as a bartender. She, her husband and five children – three young kids and two in their 20s – have implemented a safety system to check in every few hours. “If someone doesn’t check in, the plan kicks in, and we start figuring out where they are. Some of us even have location tracking on our phones as a precaution,” she said.It’s not being deported to Mexico that scares her so much, she said – it’s being ripped away from the life she’s built in the US. “What really scares me is having to start over. That’s what most of us fear: starting over again.”During the firstTrump administration, Gómez had asked her bishop to take custody of her children in case she and her husband were arrested and deported, she said. This time around, her adult children have been tasked with caring for their siblings, and contacting the family’s attorneys should anything happen to their parents.Trump’s immigration orders designed to sow chaos – ‘he wants you to feel afraid’Read moreThey have also been leaning on local networks of advocates who have been patrolling and tracking Ice activity, and investigating which rumours are credible and which ones are misinformation.Like many activists in the city, she was delighted by recent complaints by Trump’s “border czar”, Tom Homan, that Chicagoans are too “well-educated” about how to resist immigration agents.“Sanctuary cities are making it very difficult to arrest the criminals. For instance Chicago, very well-educated, they’ve been educated how to defy Ice, how to hide from Ice,” Homan told CNN on Monday night.It goes to show, she said, that people in this city know how to take care of one another. “Even though they wanted to create a spectacle here, they couldn’t do it,” she said.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationChicagoTrump administrationRaceUS politicsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But one thought gave her solace: “At least I don’t have to worry about having a baby.”In September, Clark, a 24-year-old nursing student from Battle Creek, Michigan, underwent a bilateralsalpingectomy, a sterilization procedure that removed her fallopian tubes, ensuring she will never get pregnant. Clark considers the procedure her fail-safe against any furtherrollbacks of reproductive rightsthat might occur under the newTrump administration.Clark had always known she didn’t want to have children. “I just don’t personally see myself on that path,” she said. In 2022, when she learned she was pregnant, she got an abortion. But that same year, the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade with its decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, leading Clark to seriously considerpermanent contraception. She’s not the only one.Astudypublished this month in the Health Affairs journal found that among young adults aged 19 to 26, tubal sterilization visits increased 70% after May 2022 – when the Dobbs decision leaked – in states likely to ban abortion. Tubal ligation, known as getting one’s “tubes tied”, involves cutting or blocking the fallopian tubes with clamps. A salpingectomy for permanent birth control, like Clark received, removes both fallopian tubes altogether.View image in fullscreenMadison Clark and her cat, Cow Kitty. ‘The news cycle was a huge, huge reason that I took sterilization seriously and decided to spring into action.’Photograph: Madison ClarkThe study also found that vasectomy procedures, a form of male birth control, increased 95% – but were still not as popular as tubal sterilizations. Aprevious study, published last spring, found the number of tubal ligations among women ages 18 to 30 shot up after Dobbs, at a rate of increase double that of vasectomies.“Patients are scared of losing access to all kinds of reproductive care,” said Dr Sarah K Horvath, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Penn State College of Medicine. “There are people who had the idea of permanent contraception hovering somewhere on their to-do list, and now they’re pushing it up to number one.”On TikTok, sterilization content has swelled. In onevideowith more than 73,000 likes, a creator posted footage of herself driving to an appointment and waiting on a hospital bed, with the caption: “Getting sterilized because y’all couldn’t act right in the voting booth.” One popular TikTok doctorshared a “how to” videoabout tubal sterilization a week after Trump’s inauguration. “I go on Thursday to get this procedure done,” a user wrote in the comments. “I was so worried the current administration would prevent this option so we got it scheduled Asap.”Krysten Stein, an assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati Blue Ash College who studies doctor influencers on TikTok, said that conversations on social media about sterilization reflect gen Z’s current political anxieties.“We have this rapidly changing landscape around reproductive health, and seeking information about it or posting on social media feels like a way to take back control,” Stein said. “It feels empowering to claim authority and to normalize these life choices.”In some states – including Michigan, where Clark lives – voters have enshrined abortion protections in state constitutions, and according to a recentGallup poll, a majority (54%) of Americans consider themselves “pro-choice”. That has not stopped Trump from cozying up to aninvigorated anti-abortion movement. His first week in office saw himpardon activistswho illegally blockaded the entrances to reproductive health clinics,limit fundingfor overseas groups that provide or advocate for abortions, and sign an executive order declaring gender begins “at conception”, a tenet of the“fetal personhood” doctrine.Is it safe to have a child? Americans rethink family planning ahead of Trump’s returnRead moreRobert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s nominee for secretary of health and human services,saidat his confirmation hearing on Thursday that he believed that “every abortion is a tragedy”.Trumpindicatedthat he was also open to regulating contraception last May – though the president laterpostedon Truth Social that he “WILL NEVER ADVOCATE IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON BIRTH CONTROL”. This month, the supreme court, stacked with anti-abortion justices,agreedto hear a case that threatens the Affordable Care Act’s coverage of preventative care such as birth control and pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PrEP).“The news cycle was a huge, huge reason that I took sterilization seriously and decided to spring into action,” Clark said. “Now, it’s a common conversation between my boyfriend and me: ‘God, at least we don’t have to worry about having to travel to get an abortion, or having to leave the country for one, or even being forced to carry a child, which is the most scary option in all of this.’”Nineteen states currently restrict abortion access, withbansfor nearly all circumstances present in a dozen states. Even though Julia Wolf, 29, lives in Pennsylvania, a state with abortion access, the fall of Roe planted the idea of sterilization in her mind. Like Clark, Wolf always knew she didn’t want children. After she learned that the US has thehighest maternal mortality rateamong high-income countries, even the thought of becoming pregnant frightened her.View image in fullscreenJulia Wolf: ‘It’s naive to think that other things aren’t on the line, like contraceptives or sterilization.’Photograph: Julia Wolf“Whether you agree with a woman’s right to choose or not, it’s naive to think that other things aren’t on the line, like contraceptives or sterilization,” said Wolf, who works in social media.After the 2024 election results rolled in, Wolf scheduled her bilateral salpingectomy procedure as soon as she could – the first Monday in December. Her gynecologist told her that she performed three other sterilization procedures for women that same week.“I don’t worry that I am going to regret this,” Wolf said. “I’m 100% confident in this decision, and I’m just really glad I did it, especially because everything’s moving so fast since Trump’s been president.”This month, the congressman Andy Biggs of Arizona introduced a House resolution aiming to set a new standard for women’s healthcare that “should also address the needs of men, families and communities as they relate to women’s healthcare”. The line scared Wolf.“I just know for a fact that women will never have any input on men’s health, and so for it to be the other way around is just crazy,” she said.‘I’d change doctors, get denied again’Not every person who wants a sterilization will receive one – or else they might find the process to get one needlesslyarduous.Some doctors are hesitant to sterilize women under the age of 30, especially if they are unmarried or do not already have children. Though studies show that most womendo not regretgetting permanent contraception, those who do tend to be between the ages of 21 and 30 at the time of their procedure. (Sterilization is themost common formof contraception for married couples, with 700,000 performed on women annually, half of which are performed postpartum.)The United States has an ugly history of forced sterilizations. In the 20th century, they wereperformedunder eugenics programs aimed at controlling “undesirable” populations such as minorities, poor people, unmarried women or the mentally ill. Today, people on Medicaid are legally required to wait 30 days after signing a consent form to be sterilized – in theory, to prevent vulnerable people from being manipulated into undergoing forced sterilization as they were in the past. Butactivists saythis practice is outdated and unfair. For one, there is no such restriction for people on private insurance. Thirty-day waiting periods also recall delaying tactics used in red states to limit abortion access.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)saysdoctors should advise patients about “reversible alternatives” such asvasectomyor other forms of birth control, and emphasize the permanence oftubal ligation or salpingectomy. But the ACOG also notes that doctors should “avoid paternalism” and “not [impose] thresholds based on age or parity or both for permanent contraception”.“Respect for an individual patient’s reproductive autonomy should be the primary concern guiding permanent contraception provision and policy,” the ACOG says.In her own practice, Horvath, the OB-GYN, doesn’t care so much why a person wants the procedure. She just wants them to be sure they’re making the best decision. “There are 18 different contraceptive methods, and no one is perfect,” Horvath said. “I ask that people think through all of the choices. If they’re just really worried about getting through the next four years, have they thought about an IUD? That might leave the door open for you, if permanent sterilization doesn’t feel like the right thing yet, or if you feel like you’re really just having this reaction out of fear.”Some young people say they’ve been turned away from the procedure for sexist reasons. Kasey Peterson, a 25-year-old property manager who lives in Oceanside, California, remembers playing with Barbies as a child and hearing her father say: “You’re going to make a really great mother one day.”“I distinctly remember looking at him and going, ‘Oh, I don’t want kids,’” Peterson said. As soon as she became a legal adult, she asked for a sterilization at every annual check-up. “Every single doctor said, ‘You’re too young,’ or laughed it off. I’d change doctors, get denied again, change doctors, get denied again.”View image in fullscreenKasey Peterson: ‘People are worried about protecting themselves in the future.’Photograph: Kasey PetersonThe doctors’ reasoning for delaying the procedure seemed straight out of the 1950s: her “future husband” might want children; she wasn’t mature enough to make a permanent decision. They said to come back in a couple of years, and then maybe they’d talk.“The overall tone was that I didn’t know what I wanted as an individual,” Peterson said. “It was irritating. They were basically telling me that if I was pregnant right now, they would want me to keep the pregnancy, that I was emotionally mature enough for that, but I wasn’t emotionally mature enough to decide that I don’t want children.”Peterson’s partner considered getting a vasectomy, which his doctors were more than happy to perform. “But I decided I would rather do it for myself, for insurance reasons, but also because if I were to get assaulted by someone else, his vasectomy wouldn’t cover that.”Young people navigating the serpentine process of finding OB-GYNs willing to perform sterilizations come together in forums on Facebook and Reddit, where they vent their frustrations, cheer each other on and share a Google doc of vetted doctors. Peterson eventually found her doctor through that list, and she now serves as an administrator for the Childfree and Sterile/Seeking Sterilization Facebook group.“WhenRoe v Wadewas overturned, and when Trump got elected, our group got absolutely flooded,” Peterson said. “It’s great that people are finding a community and a resource, but I hate how it happened. People are worried about protecting themselves in the future.”Explore more on these topicsRoe v WadeContraception and family planningTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS healthcareAbortionUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But was this in part a way to avoid truly confronting its past?ByPankaj MishraThu 30 Jan 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 05.18 ESTShareAfter the second world war, Germany’s contrition and radical self-cleansing, under allied supervision, as the chief tormentor of European Jews ought to have been straightforward. No country, however, matches its convoluted journey from ground zero in 1945 to Gaza today.In recent decades, solidarity with the Jewish state has burnished Germany’s proud self-image as the only country that makes public remembrance of its criminal past the very foundation of its collective identity. Particularly since German reunification, a Shoah-centred memory has been comprehensively institutionalised. School curriculums and calendars emphasise anniversaries such as 27 January (the Soviet liberation of Auschwitz) and 8 May (the final surrender of the Nazis). Monuments, memorials and museums across the country commemorate the victims of German crimes. A resonant symbol of this memory culture is the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe near the Brandenburg Gate in the capital, Berlin, probably the only major national monument to commemorate the victims of a nation rather than the nation itself.In 2008, the then German chancellor, Angela Merkel, claimed before the Knesset that ensuring Israel’s security was part of Germany’sStaatsräson, orraison d’état. The phrase was repeatedly invoked, with more vehemence than clarity, by German leaders after 7 October 2023. Less than two months before the Hamas offensive,Israelhad secured, with American blessing, its largest ever arms deal with Germany. German arms sales to Israel surged tenfold in 2023; the vast majority of sales were approved after 7 October, and fast-tracked by German officials who insisted that permits for arms exports to Israel would receive special consideration.As Israel began to bomb homes, refugee camps, schools, hospitals, mosques and churches in Gaza, and Israeli cabinet ministers promoted their schemes for ethnic cleansing, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, reiterated the national orthodoxy: “Israel is a country that is committed to human rights and international law and acts accordingly.” As Benjamin Netanyahu’s campaign of indiscriminate murder and destruction intensified, Ingo Gerhartz, the head of the German air force, or Luftwaffe, arrived in Tel Aviv hailing the “accuracy” of Israeli pilots; he also had himself photographed, in uniform, donating blood for Israeli soldiers.View image in fullscreenIngo Gerhartz, the head of the German air force, donates blood for Israeli soldiers in November 2023.Photograph: Sheba Medical CenterThe German health minister, Karl Lauterbach, approvingly retweeted a video in which an English far-right agitator claims that the Nazis were more decent than Hamas. Die Welt claimed that “Free Palestine is the new Heil Hitler” and Die Zeitalerted German readers to the apparently outrageous fact that “Greta Thunberg openly sympathises with the Palestinians”. When the minister of culture, Claudia Roth, was caught on camera applauding the Israeli film-maker Yuval Abraham and his Palestinian colleague Basel Adra at the Berlinale film festival – for their now Oscar-nominateddocumentary– she clarified that her applause was intended only for “the Jewish-Israeli” Abraham.For months, German leaders put up the strongest resistance to joint European calls for a ceasefire. The German president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, unstintingly backed Israel’s vengeful violence, much to the chagrin of many of her own colleagues; she also ignored repeated calls to sanction Israel from EU member countries such as Spain and Ireland. In October 2024, as Israel bombed hospitals and tent encampments in Gaza, and blew up entire villages in Lebanon, the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, justified these violations of international law, asserting that civilians could lose their protected status in war.German authorities also launched a ruthless crackdown on public displays of support for Palestine. State-funded cultural institutions have long penalised artists and intellectuals of non-western ancestry who show any hint of sympathy for Palestinians, retracting awards and invitations; the German authorities have now turned to disciplining even Jewish writers, artists and activists. After 7 October, Candice Breitz, Deborah Feldman, Masha Gessen and Nancy Fraser joined those either cancelled or “lectured”, as Eyal Weizman put it, “by the children and grandchildren of the perpetrators who murdered our families and who now dare to tell us that we are antisemitic”.Visiting Germany after the war, the philosopher Hannah Arendt confessed to being “oppressed by a kind of pervasive public stupidity which cannot be trusted to judge correctly the most elementary events ... A great number of Germans,” she wrote, “especially among the more educated, apparently are no longer capable of telling the truth even if they want to.”Witnessing the German public sphere in recent months, it was hard to resist a similarly damning conclusion: that self-righteous hypocrisy had been normalised enough to turn into a mode of governance and thought. As hypocrisy lapsed into self-deception, and the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) led a dramatic reshaping of the country’s politics and culture, it was also hard not to think about Germany’s past and to fear for the political future of Europe’s most important country.“In less than six years,” Arendt marvelled, “Germany laid waste the moral structure of western society, committing crimes that nobody would have believed possible.” With the intimacy and bluntness of a former insider, she recorded that a “general lack of emotion, at any rate this apparent heartlessness, sometimes covered over with cheap sentimentality, is only the most conspicuous outward symptom of a deep-rooted, stubborn and at times vicious refusal to face and come to terms with what really happened”.Such mentalities were partly manifest in German treatment of the Jewish displaced persons. They were still languishing in West Germany in 1952, when the Bavarian customs police launched a raid on a displaced persons camp. The assault had, according to the Manchester Guardian, “all the trademarks of Nazi descents on the ghettos of Berlin and Frankfurt in the past”. As the newspaper reported, quoting the camp committee, “policemen yelled such slogans as: ‘The crematoria are still there’, ‘The gas chambers are waiting for you’, and: ‘This time you really will get it in the neck, you damned Jews.’” In communist-run East Germany, antisemitism was more subtle, if not less lethal, closely mimicking Stalin’s campaign against “cosmopolitans”, which assumed that most Jews were potential spies.At the same time, as an American military officer told the photojournalist Margaret Bourke-White, many Germans were acting “as though the Nazis were a strange race of Eskimos who came down from the north pole and somehow invaded Germany”. Bourke-White herself remarked: “I have yet to find a German who will admit to being a Nazi.” As late as 1949, the philosopher Theodor Adorno wrote to Thomas Mann that aside from a “couple of total and touching puppet-like villains”, he hadn’t met a Nazi yet, “not simply in the ironic sense that people will not admit to having been Nazis, but in the far more disturbing sense that they believe they never were Nazis”.In his 2002 book Adenauer’s Germany and the Nazi Past, Norbert Frei painstakingly measures the depth and the breadth in the early postwar years of popular German sentiment against prosecuting criminals of the Nazi era or ejecting tainted elites out of positions of power. In West Germany, according to the British historian Mary Fulbrook, of the nearly 1 million people who “were at one point or another actively involved in killing Jewish civilians” (the number of enablers was much higher), “only 6,656 were convicted of Nazi crimes” – “fewer even than the number of people who had been employed at Auschwitz alone”. By the end of the 20th century, only 164 individuals had been sentenced for the crime of murder – of 6 million Jews.Ina March 2024 article for Dissent, the historian Hans Kundnani wrote: “By the mid-1950s, the elite in the civil service, judiciary, and academia had largely reverted to that of the Third Reich. Many young people growing up in west Germany felt they were ‘surrounded by Nazis’, as one person I interviewed put it. By the mid-1960s, they had begun to see not just personal continuities but structural ones: the federal republic was a fascist, or at least ‘pre-fascist’, state. The student movement emerged as a protest against these real and imagined continuities.”When in March 1960, the German chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, met his Israeli counterpart, David Ben-Gurion, in New York, he had not only been presiding over a systematic reversal of the denazification process decreed by the country’s western occupiers in 1945, he had also been aiding the suppression of the unprecedented horror of the Holocaust. The German people, according to Adenauer, were also victims of Hitler. What’s more, he went on, most Germans under Nazi rule had “joyfully helped fellow Jewish citizens whenever they could”.View image in fullscreenDavid Ben-Gurion and Konrad Adenauer at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York in 1960.Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty ImagesIn September 1952, Adenauer had agreed to a deal that would compensate the state of Israel to the extent of some 3.5bn Deutschmarks. The deal was not popular: in 1951, only 5% of Germans had admitted to guilt over the fate of the Jews, and 21% thought that “the Jews themselves were partly responsible for what happened to them during the Third Reich”. More embarrassingly, some in Adenauer’s own party voted against the deal. Nevertheless, Adenauer’s language at his meeting with Ben-Gurion was unambiguous: Israel, he said, is a “fortress of the west”, adding: “I can already now tell you that we will help you, we will not leave you alone.”The German chancellor possessed the typical worldview of a western colonialist: as vice president of the German Colonial Society he had urged the German reich to possess colonies in order to create more living space for the German people. But, as the cold war intensified, he was also convinced that Germany’s “long road west” – the title of historian Heinrich Winkler’s bestselling book about German history – lay through Israel. “The power of the Jews even today, especially in America, should not be underestimated,” he said after his retirement. West Germany moved quickly along that road west after 1960, becoming a major supplier of military hardware to Israel in addition to being the main enabler of its economic modernisation.The postwar German-Israeli symbiosis was at the centre of the “unprincipled political gamesmanship”, in Primo Levi’s bitter words, that expedited the rehabilitation of Germany only a few years after the full extent of its genocidal antisemitism became known. By the mid-1960s, when the Jewish Austrian writer Jean Améry travelled through Germany, the country was savouring its so-called economic miracle, partly due to the American loans that were also sparking a broader European recovery. In “the industrial paradise of the New Europe”, Améry found himself unexpectedly discussing the latest European and American novels with Germany’s “refined” intellectuals. Yet the survivor of Auschwitz could not expunge from his memory the “stony faces” of Germans before a pile of corpses at a railway platform or of the Flemish SS man who beat him on the head with a shovel handle whenever he didn’t work fast enough. And he would discover that in this “thriving land”, he bore a new “grudge” against Germans and their exalted place in the “majestic halls of the west”.The flip side of west Germany’s accommodation of Nazis was what Améry called an “obtrusive philosemitism”. This philosemitism – parasitic on old antisemitic stereotypes, and combined with sentimental images of Jews – still shapes Germany’s relationship to Israel. By 1965, Eleonore Sterling, a survivor of the Shoah and Germany’s first female professor of political science, was describing how “a functional philosemitic attitude” had replaced “a true act of understanding, repentance and future vigilance”. The historian Peter Gay, who had fled Nazi Germany with his Jewish family in 1939, was among the German Jews “sickened” by his former neighbours’ new “greasy delicacy, an ostentatious admiration for everything that Jews said, did, or believed”. So was the novelist Manès Sperber. “Your philosemitism depresses me,” he wrote to a colleague, “degrades me like a compliment that is based on an absurd misunderstanding … You overestimate us Jews in a dangerous fashion and insist on loving our entire people. I don’t request this, I do not wish for us – or any other people – to be loved in this way.”View image in fullscreenJean Améry in 1977.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/AlamyBut the philosemitism was also a strategic mode of self-regard. Writing from Jerusalem in April 1961, Hannah Arendt reported that the Germans present at the trial of Adolf Eichmann, were “displaying an unpleasant overeagerness and finding absolutely everything wonderful. Enough to make you throw up, if I may say so. One of them has already flung his arms around my neck and burst into tears.”In his writing on the trial of Eichmann, the scholar Daniel Marwecki described how visions of Israel as a new embodiment of Jewish power also awakened dormant German fantasies. A report by the West German delegation to the Eichmann trial marvelled at “the novel and very advantageous type of the Israeli youth”, who are “of great height, often blond and blue-eyed, free and self-determined in their movements with well-defined faces” and exhibit “almost none of the features which one used to view as Jewish”. On 7 June 1967, after the six-day war, the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung greeted Israel’s victory with an editorial titled “Der Blitzkrieg Israels”. This phrase, associated with the Nazi assault on Europe, was then emblazoned on the front pages of Die Zeit and Der Spiegel (which commented on German blood donations for Israel with “Aryan blood flowed for the Jews”). The newspaper Die Weltregretted German “infamies” about the Jewish people: the belief that they were “without national sentiment; never ready for battle, but always keen to profit from somebody else’s war effort”. The Jews were in fact a “small, brave, heroic, genius people”.Axel Springer, whose eponymous company publishes Die Welt, and who was among the majorpostwar employers of superannuated Nazis, boasted after the six-day war that he had published Israeli newspapers in Germany for six days. The German New Left that turned anti-Israel around this time, alienating Améry among others, was partly reacting to Springer’s truculent propaganda, as well as to the presence of Nazis in the civil service, judiciary and academia, and to “the vocal support of West German political parties across the spectrum for the US military intervention in Vietnam”, as the historian Quinn Slobodian wrote.Many students, including future terrorists such as Ulrike Meinhof, had idealised the US as a defender of freedom and democracy; they became disturbed by reports of American carpet bombing of Vietnam, using napalm designed to remove skin, and bombs built to explode in mid-air and inject shrapnel into flesh. They were frustrated, too, by the malicious caricatures of their idealism by Springer’s tabloid press as well as the German political establishment. “Fighting for the defence of western freedom with carpet bombing,” according to an activist quoted by Slobodian, did not only injure the “moral feelings” of many young Germans: “The entire existing framework for understanding the world was put into question.”Imagining Jewish Israelis as Aryan warriors, the German press further undermined that framework for understanding the world. At any rate, Bild likening the Israeli military leader Moshe Dayan to the Nazi field marshall Erwin Rommel wasn’t a contradiction. Such comparisons were an imperative for some beneficiaries of the German economic miracle. Marwecki writes that Adenauer made a major loan and the supply of military equipment “dependent on the Israeli handling of the trial” of Adolf Eichmann.The Israeli philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz remarked many years after Eichmann was hanged that his “trial was a total failure; Eichmann really was a small and insignificant cog in a big machine. I think it was a conspiracy by Adenauer and Ben-Gurion to clear the name of the German people. In exchange they paid us billions.” Marwecki provides the belated evidence for this scandalous claim while describing the “exchange structure specific to German-Israeli relations”: moral absolution of an insufficiently denazified and still profoundly antisemitic Germany in return for cash and weapons.Cheap discharge of guilt was one motivation. Back in the early 1960s, however, it greatly suited Germany as well as Israel to portray Arab adversaries of Israel, including Nasser (dubbed “Hitler on the Nile” by the Daily Mail), as the true embodiments of nazism. The Eichmann trial underplayed the persistence of Nazi support in Germany while exaggerating the Nazi presence in Arab countries.In her recent book Subcontractors of Guilt, Esra Özyürek describes the way that German politicians, officials and journalists, now that the far right is in the ascendant, crank up the old mechanism of sanitising Germany by demonising Muslims. Cheer-led by Elon Musk,who encourages Germans to abandon their “guilt”over the Holocaust and exult in their thousand-year-old “German culture”, and emboldened by the electoral triumph in Austria, Hitler’s homeland, of a far-right party founded by a former member of the SS, the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) has become Germany’ssecond most popularparty. The suspicion that some prominent German supporters of Israel are projecting their long taboo nationalism on to a proxy state is deepened by the self-declared motto “Zionismus über alles” (Zionism above all) of Mathias Döpfner, present-day CEO of Axel Springer – the phrase alludes to the erstwhile first line of the German national anthem, Deutschland Über Alles, which was deleted due to its association with Nazi Germany.View image in fullscreenElon Musk speaks via video at an AfD rally last weekend.Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesYet “white Christian-background Germans” see themselves “as having reached their destination of redemption and re-democratisation”, according to Özyürek. The “general German social problem of antisemitism” is projected on to a minority of Middle Eastern immigrants, who are then further stigmatised as “the most unrepentant antisemites” in need of “additional education and disciplining”. To denounce Germany’s Muslim minority as “the major carriers of antisemitism”, as Özyürek points out, is to suppress the fact that nearly “90% of antisemitic crimes are committed by rightwing white Germans”.In his recent book Never Again, the historian Andrew I Port suggests that the conviction among Germans that “they had left the rabid racism of their forebears far behind them may have paradoxically allowed for the unabashed expression of different forms of racism”. This partly accounts for the extraordinary callousness, bordering on racial contempt, in Germany over the fate of Palestinians. Increasingly, Germany’s much-lauded culture of historical memory seems to have maintained an appearance of success only because the German ruling class had, until recently, less occasion to expose its historical delusions than, for instance, the Brexiters dreaming of imperial-era strength and self-sufficiency.It is almost as though by claiming to be the culture most dedicated to memorialising the Shoah, Germany managed to avoid reckoning with the crimes that necessitated that culture in the first place. In 1975, the literary critic Hans Mayer, who moved from East to West Germany in 1963, derided “the fundamentally unsound relationship of the average German toward the phenomenon of the Jew and the state of Israel”. This unsoundness is now manifest in a variety of ways, including in the number of Germans fraudulently claiming to be Jewish, asa May 2024 article in the Bafflerdetailed in harrowing fashion.As the historian Frank Stern unsparingly diagnosed in 1992 in The Whitewashing of the Yellow Badge, German philosemitism is primarily a “political instrument”, used not only to “justify options in foreign policy”, but also “to evoke and project a moral stance in times when domestic tranquillity is threatened by antisemitic, anti-democratic and rightwing extremist phenomena”. Thus, German Israelphilia and philosemitism is peaking just as there is again a recrudescence in Germany of far-right furies.This perverse dialectic helps explain why, while commemorating the Shoah and proclaiming its undying support for Israel, Germany ignores the atrocities Germans inflicted on Asians and Africans during the brief rampages of German colonialism. In China in 1900-01, German troops faithfully followed their Kaiser’s instructions to behave like “Huns”, in their bid to crush the “yellow peril”. Then in 1904 in German South-West Africa (contemporary Namibia) the German imperial army killed an estimated 65,000 Herero people out of a total population of approximately 80,000. German colonialists suppressing another uprising in east Africa in 1905-07 killed, with machine guns, dozens of people at a time – altogether 80,000 people died in the fighting and another 200,000 were consumed in the famine that followed.View image in fullscreenNamibian war prisoners captured by Germany in the 1904 war.Photograph: National Archives of Namibia/AFP/Getty ImagesMany more Africans, 350,000 in one estimate, were killed between 1914 and 1918, when Germany, attempting to hold on to its colonies, turned the natives under its control into grist for the first world war’s slaughter machine. The Nobel laureate Abdulrazak Gurnah, whose grandfather in Zanzibar was conscripted as a carrier by German troops, is among many who have wondered “why the history and experience of German colonialism in Africa was so ferociously brutal”. In many ways, Germany’s brutality toward Asians and Africans prefigured its atrocities in eastern Europe: in 2006, Raffael Scheck described in Hitler’s African Victims how the killing sprees of theEinsatzgruppenin the bloodlands of the east – shooting people by the edge of mass graves which the victims themselves had been forced to dig – was prefigured by the massacres in May and June 1940 of thousands of French African soldiers. But there are no incentives to project a moral stance in the case of black Africans, let alone declare their wellbeing to be Germany’sStaatsräsonas domestic tranquillity is again threatened by antisemitic, anti-democratic and rightwing extremist phenomena.The political and moral deformations and intellectual helplessness of Germany today are more dangerous than at any other time since 1945. The AfD is no aberration; it benefits from a broadening lurch to the extreme right among mainstream politicians and journalists. The likely next German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, the leader of the centre-right Christian Democrats, has recently broken the German mainstream’s “firewall” against the AfD, promising to work with politicians overfond of Nazi slogans and salutes. Meanwhile, German courts are trying a far-right group for plotting the violent overthrow of the government. The country that laid waste the moral structure of western society looks feeble again before the economic crises and social breakdowns of capitalism that first produced fascism.Worse: Germany’s long road west now leads straight to Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Germany’s pre-eminent philosopher Jürgen Habermas once hailed the “unconditional opening of the federal republic to the political culture of the west” as the most important achievement of postwar Germany. According to this argument, Germans had strayed too far off the road to the west and ended up committing monstrous crimes. Thus Habermas lauded an exemplary “western civilisation” from which Germans had unwisely dissociated themselves. Germans could become part of a superior west again by putting the Shoah and undying commitment to Israel at the centre of their collective identity and by renouncing ethnonationalism.But this entire framework for understanding the world, and Germany’s place in it, has been tottering in recent years. Habermas and others have convinced themselves their country safely converted to liberalism on its high road to the west through Israel; they don’t, however, seem to ponder the fact that the old idea of the west has never seemed more incoherent and unconvincing.Refined during the cold war, this conception of the west had a large, self-flattering Anglo-American component, signifying electoral democracy, free markets and individual freedoms, in contrast to totalitarian regimes. But the US has lurched in the last decade from calamitously failed wars to far-right demagoguery, and Britain, deceived by blustery rogues into Brexit, is unlikely to recover soon from an extreme act of self-harm. The “political culture of the west” does not inspire great admiration even within the west today.Revealingly, the binary of the enlightened west and unenlightened east – once used to authorise the Nazi quest forLebensraumin the east and then adapted to serve cold war policy agendas – is the currency today of far-right nationalists across Israel, Europe and America. During Israel’s assault on Gaza, Netanyahu announced that he is fighting the “new Nazis” in Gaza in order to save “western civilisation”. Others in his cohort of Jewish supremacists kept up a supporting chorus denouncing the people of Gaza as “subhuman”, “animals” and “Nazis”. Hitler himself was convinced, when Jews were conceived as subhuman and animals, that the fate of western civilisation rested on his shoulders. And there was much about western democracies – especially their foundations in white supremacy, and cultures of racism and antisemitism – that allowed Hitler to believe that they would welcome his extermination of Jews.Germany’s postwar quest for normalisation – whether through philosemitism and west-philia, orStaatsräsonand proud and ostentatious self-reproach – has reached a dead end. It always seemed implausible that a collective moral education could produce a stable, homogeneous attitude across the generations. There are too many other factors determining what is remembered and what is forgotten, and the German national subconscious is burdened by a century of secrecy, crimes and cover-ups. It should not surprise us then that, asvölkisch-authoritarian racism surged at home, Germany yet again became complicit, through its unconditional solidarity with Netanyahu, Smotrich, Gallant and Ben-Gvir, in murderous ethnonationalism. As Günter Grass wrote in his 2002 novel Crabwalk: “History, or, to be more precise, the history we Germans have repeatedly mucked up, is a clogged toilet. We flush and flush, but the shit keeps rising.”Adapted from The World After Gaza by Pankaj Mishra, published by Fern Press on 6 FebruaryListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readGermanyIsraelJudaismAntisemitismIsrael-Gaza warNazismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But can our writer carry it off?Tim DowlingThu 30 Jan 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 11.28 ESTShareThe woman at the veg shop is admiring my new ivory padded shoulder bag. Perhaps admiring is the wrong word.“So, is this, like, a thing now?” she says.“Apparently,” I say.I am old enough to remember declarations of the man bag’s arrival stretching back to the 70s and 80s. While its perennial reintroduction turned it into a fashion cliche, it also reinforced the notion that it would never truly catch on. Men had devised other ways to cart their stuff about and would remain for ever resistant to the handbag.Then, last July, I was watching news footage of some young men fighting in the streets of an English town. Almost all of them were wearing an identical summer uniform: white T-shirt, shorts and a black cross-body bumbag. I thought: I have missed something.View image in fullscreenTimothée Chalamet (left) with his Chanel bag, and Tim Dowling with his lookalike.Composite: Backgrid; Linda Nylind/the GuardianThe latest evolution of the man bag is also a form of extinction: fashionable men have begun to appear in public wearing what we might once have described, for lack of a better term, as ladies’ handbags. Timothée Chalamet pairs a baseball cap with a tinychain-strap Chanel number. Harry Styles goes about town with abamboo-handled Gucci bag. In his debut 2024 spring-summer collection,Pharrell Williamsrevived theLouis Vuitton Speedy– once the bag of choice for Jessica Simpson and Miley Cyrus – as a menswear accessory. Again, I have missed something. How can I hope to catch up?Ill at ease as I may be with the idea of sporting a “woman’s handbag”, I am absolutely at sea when it comes to shopping for one. I have pictures on my phone of popular women’s bags being worn by men, but I am incapable of discerning whether any of the bags on the shelves in the stores are a suitable match. They all look the same to me. I am beginning to perspire in TK Maxx. I think I may be bag blind.Finally, I track down a shearling bag in the women’s department of M&S that seems to fit the bill. Without trying it on, I take it to the till.“Do you need a bag for your bag, or are you just going to carry it?” asks the saleswoman.“Oh no, I need a bag,” I say.View image in fullscreenHarry Styles (left) with a Gucci bag and Pharrell Williams with a Louis Vuitton bag.Composite: JMEnternational for BRIT Awards/Getty Images; Marc Piasecki/WireImageElsewhere on the high street, I source a black cross-body bag that looks like something you could fight in on a hot night to celebrate England losing a vital qualifier. Later that day, a chain-strap clutch is delivered to my door. Slowly, a collection assembles.“I’m not going out with you while you’re wearing that,” my wife says the next day, pointing to the shearling bag over my shoulder.“Really? Which one should I wear?” I say, indicating the array of statement bags lined up on the sofa.When it becomes apparent that I will be going to the shops by myself, I select the brownAsosweave tote – to my bag-blind eyes, a dead ringer for Bottega Veneta’s signatureintrecciatobags, as sported by such luminaries as the actor Joe Alwyn. I like it because it is stylish yet capacious enough to hold a litre of milk and a box of cat food.View image in fullscreenJoe Alwyn (left) with a Bottega Veneta bag, and Tim Dowling’s attempt.Composite: Marc Piasecki/GC Images for Bottega Veneta; Linda Nylind/The GuardianBut, on the way to the shops, I realise I am having trouble making the look my own. The extent of the discomfort I feel carrying a women’s tote catches me by surprise: it triggers memories of my mother making me hold her bag while she tried something on in the aisle of a dress shop. It is a memory of undiluted mortification. I am doing now what I did then – holding the bag slightly out in front of me, as if it contains something I am allergic to.Fortunately, it is 2025 and I live in London, so there is nothing to be embarrassed about; no one cares what you are putting your shopping in at the self-checkout. In any case, the very idea of a gender-specific bag now seems obsolete. The kind of style this chocolate-brown tote represents is timeless – if it is good enough for Alwyn, it is good enough for me.When the rain intensifies on the way home, I briefly break into a run, before thinking: stop, or people will think you have just stolen this bag.The next day, I find myself in my local shopping precinct wearing a passable stand-in for Bottega Veneta’s Cassette bag. The actorJacob Elordiis sometimes seen wearing one of these, which he cites as a necessity. “When I leave home, I need to have a certain thing from every category with me in case I get bored,”he told GQ. “A book, a notepad, rolls of film, a camera, a pen.” Mine contains the scrunched-up paper stuffing it came with.View image in fullscreenJacob Elordi (left) with a Bottega Veneta Cassette bag, and Tim Dowling’s take.Composite: Daniele Venturelli/Getty Images for Bottega Veneta; Linda Nylind/The GuardianThis is a big problem: I don’t really have anything to put in a bag like this. I can accommodate a pen, a notepad and a camera (my phone) in my pockets. I have a work bag – a canvas rucksack – for when I need to carry a laptop, various chargers, a spare pair of socks and possibly a bottle of train-station wine. But I have no use for a bag the size of a single paperback.Also, it would be fair to say I am not really carrying it off. To stroll around with a padded clutch over one shoulder requires something I possess very little of – let’s call it insouciance. I don’t think I look very insouciant; I think I look as if I am carrying essential medication.I am even more uncomfortable going out and about with a classicGucci Jackie bag. This is not because it is too feminine – the Jackie featured heavily on the catwalk in the autumn/winter menswear shows – but because its retail price lies somewhere north of £3,000. Even if I stuffed it with my laptop, my phone, my glasses and the cash equivalent of my overdraft facility, the bag would still be worth more than the contents.View image in fullscreenTim gets into the swing of it at the local market.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianDown at the western extremity of the local market, wearing my shearling bag from M&S, I attract a number of sidelong glances. These are hard to interpret – one of the rules of sidelong glances is that you shouldn’t return them – but I don’t think the bag has much to do with it. It’s probably because I don’t often lurk suspiciously at this end of the market, while a lot of other people transparently do. It could also have something to do with the photographer who is ordering me to stand among the ladies’ dresses for sale, because she likes the way they billow in the near gale-force winds.Under the circumstances, my reasonably priced, faux-fleece cross-body bag provides a certain strange comfort. With it tucked securely against my frame, I am reassured knowing it contains my glasses case, my keys and a couple of potatoes for later.Explore more on these topicsMen's fashionHandbagsChanelGucciLouis VuittonZaraMarks & SpencerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Juliette Pavy/The GuardianWhile the US president seems hellbent on securing Greenland, local experts advise that achieving control of its potentially lucrative shipping route will be no mean featByMiranda Bryantin NuukSeascape: the state of our oceans is supported byAbout this contentThu 30 Jan 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 10.01 ESTShareIf shipping boss Niels Clemensen were to offer any advice toDonald Trumpor anyone else trying to get a foothold in Greenland, it would be this: “Come up here and see what you are actually dealing with.”Sitting on the top floor of his beamed office in Nuuk harbour, where snow is being flung around by strong winds in the mid-morning darkness outside and shards of ice pass by in the fast-flowing water, the chief executive of Greenland’s only shipping company, Royal Arctic Line, says: “What you normally see as easy [setting up operations] in the US or Europe is not the same up here.” As well as the cold, ice and extremely rough seas, the world’s biggest island does not have a big road network or trains, meaning everything has to be transported either by sea or air. “I’m not saying that it’s not possible. But it’s going to cost a lot of money.”With the potential to slash shipping times between Europe and Asia by thousands of miles – or as much as two weeks – the opening up of the Northwest Passageas the Arctic ice meltsis viewed by some as an upside of the climate crisis and one of themain reasons Trump has takensuch an interest in Greenland.Map showing the Northwest Passage and GreenlandWith its critical position along the highly coveted route – which passes through the CanadianArcticarchipelago instead of the traditional passage via the Panama Canal – Greenland is likely to have an important role to play in its future.But the spotlight on Greenland – and, the shifting focus of the world’s superpowers on the Arctic region as a whole – has highlighted just how poorly equipped for the Arctic environment much of Europe and the US in fact is. Nowhere is this more stark than in thelack of icebreakers– the expensive specialist ships vital for operating in the Northwest Passage and the region more generally.Even if Denmark decides to order a new fleet of icebreakers now, the ships take several years to build“Opening up the Northwest Passage doesn’t mean the ice is gone,” says Clemensen, whose ships (not icebreakers) are used to import and export across the whole of Greenland. “We’re not talking about an all-year-round free passage. The ice is retreating, but it is still there.”Denmark, which is responsible for Greenland’s defence, does not have a single icebreaker – having retired its remaining three in 2010. Yet the ownership of these specialist vessels has suddenly become what could be a new front in the fight for dominance between the world’s biggest powers – commanding access to everything from shipping routes to search and rescue and minerals. Such is the attraction of Greenland that Trump has not ruled out using military force to get it.SinceTrump’s renewed advances, Copenhagen has said it is preparing for the fact that it may have to purchase icebreakers for Arctic defence. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, recently visited an icebreaker in Finland – a country which has several of them. But even if she decided to order a new fleet now, the ships take several years to build.View image in fullscreenA fisher breaks the ice to enter the port of Nuuk, 15 January. Bringing in icebreakers could harm their livelihoods as they go out on the ice to fish.Photograph: Juliette Pavy/The GuardianRussia is by far and away the icebreaker superpower. It is understood to have at least 50 icebreakers – at least 13 of which can operate in the Arctic and seven of which are nuclear – as well as a substantial network of ports in the region. China is understood to have four that are suitable for the Arctic, while new Nato members Sweden and Finland, as well as the US and Canada, all own their own versions of these specialist vessels. There are also a growing number of icebreaker cruise vessels catering to Arctic tourists.Commercial vessels wanting to use the passage must have icebreaking capabilities as the ice-free window, if it happens, will be as little as three months long. And even in the summer, polar-coded vessels – those, like Clemensen’s, that are designed and certified to operate safely in the harsh ice conditions of the Arctic – are needed. If Greenland’s mining were to take off then icebreakers would be essential to access minerals in the fjords when they freeze over.View image in fullscreenVittus Qujaukitsoq, chief executive of KNAPK, says loss of ice is already affecting the traditional way of living.Photograph: Christian Klindt Soelbeck/AFP/Getty ImagesPointing to a big framed map of Greenland hanging on his office wall, Clemensen says they have the Arctic ice drifting down the east coast which closes together so that it has no gapsduring the winter and moves south in summer. “That’s multi-year ice. It’s very hard and it’s big flakes. We pass it, we don’t go in and break it with our vessels.”Then there is the west ice, which comes from the Canadian side starting in November and building up until it closes down as far as Disko Bay on Greenland’s west coast. “When it hits Greenland then it builds up and you’re not able to pass through. That is the situation we are looking at right now and it could go for two to three months. But it depends on wind and current in the sea.”While you could get through with an icebreaker, to do so would put the livelihoods of coastal communities at risk who go out on to the ice to fish species that include shrimp, halibut, redfish and cod. The same communities also hunt seals, walrus, reindeer and small numbers of polar bear in winter.Vittus Qujaukitsoq, a former government minister and chief executive of KNAPK, Greenland’s business association for professional fishers and hunters, says: “Some people think it would be a great help to have icebreakers [in order to help get small fishing boats out on to the water], but not everyone, because they would ruin their way of living.”I’m obsessed with icebreaking: I was trained not to hit anything – now I drive my ship into ice 24/7Read moreQujaukitsoq says depleting ice and unpredictable weather caused by the climate crisis is already affecting hunting and fishing in Greenland’s rural communities. Carbon emissions are also speeding up the melting of inland ice. “It is affecting our livelihood economically, but also threatening our traditional way of living,” he says. The ice, he adds, must be safe to walk and drive on. “The safety is measured upon the thickness of the ice. In a few short periods we are able to go by car, but most of the traffic is conducted by dog sled and snowmobiles for icefishing.”If the Northwest Passage were to become busier and icebreakers came through breaking up the ice at inappropriate times, he says it would have a “significant effect” on the Inuit people who live along the shipping route and “pose a threat for our existence long term”.Johanna Ikävalko, director of the Arctic Centre, says there is “an elevated need for high-performance icebreakers” in the region, but still considers the Northwest Passage a “very risky area for navigating”. If it were to be used to transport oil for example, the ice conditions would pose a “huge risk” even for a routine journey.View image in fullscreenA nuclear-powered icebreaker in Murmansk.

Russia, she adds, has multiple military bases in the Artic near Murmansk which it has been developing for years. “I started to think last summer that the world order will actually start to evolve from the Arctic – and now it’s even more possible.”Explore more on these topicsSeascape: the state of our oceansGreenlandArcticClimate crisisDenmarkRussiaDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Miranda Bryant reportsIn 2019, whenDonald Trumpfirst raised the prospect of the US acquiring Greenland, few people took it seriously. But today, at the start of his second term as president, when Trump says “I think we’re going to have it”, his words ring alarm bells.To find out why the world’s largest island is of such enduring interest to Trump,Miranda Bryant, the Guardian’s Nordic correspondent, recently travelled to Greenland’s capital, Nuuk. There, she tellsHelen Pidd, Greenlanders are well aware of the minerals and strategic value that their island holds, especially as the changing climate is accelerating superpower competition in the Arctic.Miranda also learns that Trump’s attention is well timed, as after a series of scandals Greenlanders are increasingly considering their relationship withDenmarkand the prospect of independence. And the US is no stranger to the island, with a military base and warm relations that stretch back to the second world war.However, while Greenland is clearly on the frontline of Trump’s expansionist second-term ambitions, if Greenlanders are to have a say in their own destiny, Miranda believes they are much more likely to opt for a form of cooperation rather than their island being “bought or sold” by anyone.Photograph: Emil Stach/ReutersExplore more on these topicsGreenlandToday in FocusTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS foreign policyDenmarkArcticIndigenous peoples"

Local sources told Agence France-Presse that fighters from M23 had seized two districts in South Kivu province as they advanced towards the provincial capital, Bukavu, the second largest city in eastern DRC.In a late-night address on Wednesday, the Congolese president, Félix Tshisekedi, called on young people to enlist in the army “massively” and vowed “a vigorous and coordinated response” to the rebel advance.On Monday, rebel fighters and Rwandan soldiersswept into Goma, the capital of North Kivu province and a regional hub for displaced people, in the biggest escalation since 2012 of a decades-old conflict.Congo’s army has its main line of defence in the city of Kavumu. If the rebels advance beyond Kavumu, Bukavu could be threatened. Some of the Congolese troops driven out by M23 in Goma fled to Bukavu.In his first public address since the fall of Goma, Tshisekedi said a “vigorous and coordinated response against these terrorists and their sponsors” was under way. “Enlist massively in the army because you are the spearhead of our country,” he said.The president criticised what he described as the “silence and inaction” of the international community, calling it an affront in the face of an “unprecedented worsening of the security situation” that he said could lead straight to an escalation in the broader Great Lakes region.The M23 rebels in eastern DRC are backed by 4,000 troops from neighbouring Rwanda, according to UN experts, far more than in 2012 when the group briefly captured Goma.Lammy tells Rwanda it is putting $1bn in aid ‘under threat’ in DRC invasionRead moreA sustained and successful push into South Kivu would put the territory under rebel control for the first time since the end of two major wars that ran from 1996 to 2003, in which millions of civilians died, mostly from malnutrition and disease. Troops from neighbouring Burundi, which has had hostile relations with Rwanda, support Congolese troops in South Kivu, meaning the risk of a wider conflict would increase.Rwanda is facing mounting international pressure over its role in the fighting. The US said it was“deeply troubled”by escalation of the conflict, Germany cancelling a planned meeting with Rwandan officials next month, and the UK told Kigali that it was putting $1bn (£800m) in global aid“under threat”.The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, landed in Rwanda on Thursday to discuss the crisis. His ministry said he would call for the withdrawal of Rwandan troops from DRC. Barrot had been in Kinshasa earlier in the day to meet Tshisekedi.Tshisekedi snubbed an emergency virtual summit called by the East African Community bloc to discuss the conflict in his country. At the meeting, attended by Paul Kagame, the Rwandan president, leaders called for an immediate ceasefire and a peaceful resolution through talks between DRC and armed groups.DRC is rich in gold and other minerals such as cobalt, coltan, tantalum and tin used in batteries and electronics. Kinshasa has accused Rwanda of waging the offensive to profit from the region’s mineral wealth, a claim backed by UN experts who say Kigali has thousands of troops in its neighbour and “de facto control” over the M23.Rwanda has denied the accusations and does not admit to military involvement in its neighbour. Kagame has said Rwanda’s support for the M23 is aimed at destroying the FDLR, a DRC-based armed group created by former Hutu leaders who massacred Tutsis during the Rwandan genocide.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Britain has been denied consular access to Fattah.The UK’s envoy to the UN in Geneva, Simon Manley, also publicly criticised Egypt on Monday, saying: “The continued detention of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, detained for spreading false news, who has now served his five-year sentence including pre-trial detention, is unacceptable.” Manley urged Egypt to end the practice of rotating detainees in pre-trial detention.View image in fullscreenAlaa Abd el-Fattah: ‘They basically don’t recognise me as citizen.’Photograph: Omar Robert Hamilton/ReutersFattah’s letters show how his initial optimism at Lammy’s appointment fell away as the Labour government failed to secure his release, and a growing feeling that only the prime minister could elevate his plight to the level required.His mother is now protesting daily outside Downing Street, rather than the Foreign Office, reflecting the believe that the Foreign Office does not have the necessary leverage. She has lost 21kg on a 122-day hunger strike and her GP has told her her sugar levels put her in serious danger of a heart attack.Fattah wrote to his aunt Ahdaf in August: “I sawDavid Lammyfinally, an impressive man. Of course we [previously] had a foreign secretary who looked big and impressive so I know that’s not the measure of anything.

In any case, let’s see what the prosecutor-general [of Egypt] will say, and what the intentions of His Majesty’s new government are.”On 4 December, in a short communal letter to the whole of his family, Fattah reflected that Keir Starmer had met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping “and spoke about the comrade from Hong Kong [Jimmy Lai].“I wonder if he’s paying any attention to me. I’ve said from the start that if they can’t or don’t want to or don’t care to argue about a consular visit then one can’t look to them for a release, because it means they basically don’t recognise me as citizen and they endorse the local authority not recognising me as a human being.“So probably the next step is to give up both nationalities and live without either (optimistic, of course, since this assumes life in some future stage).”I owe Alaa Abd el-Fattah my life, which is why I am going on a hunger strike to help free him | Peter GresteRead moreBriefly, on 30 December he wrote: “How are you all? I hope the new year finds you well. Of course the fact that a whole year has passed under these conditions does not engender optimism or inspire hope. But, anyway, let’s hope it will be a good year for Syria and lighter on the Palestinians.”On 6 January he wrote about measuring the passage of time by observing a trio of cats that visit him in his cell: “Heba came back and visited me yesterday, Wes is living with us, and Rihana drops in from time to time.“Their dramas used to be teenage dramas; we weren’t part of them but they happened around us, so we had an imagined narrative. Now they come back hungry or hurt or sick or withdrawn or emotional: adult dramas that happen outside our cell so we no longer really understand what’s going on.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyEgyptForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeDavid LammyHuman rightsMiddle East and north AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Businessesinside the USandacross the worldhave warned of widespread disruption if the Trump administration pushes ahead.Trump repeatedly pledged on the campaign trail to use tariffs to revive the US economy, disregardingmany economists’ concernsthat imposing higher duties on goods from overseas would exacerbate inflation, rather than rapidly bring down prices, as the president has promised.‘We just can’t take the hit’: businesses worldwide brace as Trump threatens tariffsRead moreWhile the Trump campaign mooted a universal tariff on all foreign goods, the Trump administration has so far opted to target specific US trading partners. The president has made clear that China and the European Union are in his sights, but has so far focused on America’s closest neighbors.Weeks after his election victory last November, Trump announced on his own social network that upon his return to office he would “sign all necessary documents” to impose a 25% tariff onMexicoand Canada. Mexico must stop “illegal aliens” from crossing its border with the US, he said, and Canada must halt the flow of drugs like fentanyl. “Until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!”Trump did not, in fact, sign these documents following his inauguration. Instead, he introduced a deadline – 1 February – by which both countries are supposed to resolve his concerns.Asked about the deadline on Thursday, he said: “We may or may not. We’re going to make that determination probably tonight.”Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president, has alreadytaken Trump throughthe various migration initiatives her government has undertaken. Experts haveraised questionsover Trump’s demand from Canada, with so little fentanyl entering the US through its northern border that the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) omitted to even mention Canadain a 2020 report.Unswayed by such details, in recent weeks Trump has claimed his administration will raise “hundreds of billions of dollars, and even trillions of dollars” through tariffs that would boost the US economy. He has spoken ofestablishing an “external revenue service”to collect the money.While he and his allies continue to talk up tariffs as a viable financial revenue stream for the US, Trump – who as both politician and reality TV star has spoken highly of his dealmaking prowess – has previously raised them as a negotiating tactic, only to withdraw the threat.This strategy played out less than a week after his inauguration, when the White House threatened Colombia with tariffs and sanctions as punishment for its refusal to accept military flights carrying deportees.Colombia later agreed, and the threat was withdrawn.InCanada, ministers have expressed optimism that a resolution by Saturday remains possible. “I remain hopeful we’re going to be able to solve this. We’ve been doing it for 150 years together,” David McGuinty, the public safety minister, told reporters. “I don’t see why we can’t do it now.”Since Trump’s initial social media post about the Canadian border, officials in Ottawa have pledged to spend C$1.3bn for new measures, including the use of two Black Hawk helicopters and 60 drones.But it stands ready to hit back. A first round of retaliatory tariffs would cause minimal damage to the US, covering C$37bn of its exports to Canada, and if needed, Canada’s federal government plans to escalate by imposing tariffs on C$110bn worth of goods.Trump’s tariff plan will send prices ‘through the roof’, warn US firmsRead more“The reality is that a large, uncontrolled bully is using his position as the most powerful political leader in the world, to put pressure on a whole range of allies,” said Lawrence Herman, an international trade lawyer and senior fellow at the CD Howe Institute. “We have to, in Canada and the rest of the world, recognize that we’ve entered a new era.“With the Trump administration, there are no rules. There is no respect for international treaties or agreements. There is no longer value to the US signature on international documents.”In Mexico, meanwhile, the government has sent signals it is prepared to do more on migration and fentanyl trafficking – evennotching up a record seizure soon after Trump’s threats began– but it has also sought to play down the prospects of a trade war.“We don’t think [the tariffs] will happen. And if they do, we have our plan,” Sheinbaum said on Wednesday.“People are worried here, and there is a sense of uncertainty – which is what Donald Trump seeks to create,” said Kenneth Smith Ramos, Mexico’s former chief negotiator during talks over the USMCA free trade deal, struck between the US, Mexico and Canada during the first Trump administration.“It’s a bit like a game of chicken: the two cars are hurtling towards each other at top speed,” he said. “Mexico has to send the signal that its car is not a little one but a big one that could also hurt the United States.”Exports account for roughly 40% of Mexico’s gross domestic product (GDP), and more than 80% of them go to the US. While the country would try to diversify its export markets in the event of an economic dispute with the US, “you’re never going to be able to replace the US market with any other country”, said Smith Ramos.Ministers have stressed that “cool heads” are required in the face of Trump’s public threats and declined to disclose their plan of action if tariffs are imposed. “But you can be sure we have studied it a great deal,” Marcelo Ebrard, the Mexican economic secretary, said recently. “There will be no surprises, nor untimely reactions.”Have a question about tariffs?

The Panamanian government strongly denies the accusation.“I cannot negotiate and much less open a process of negotiation on the canal,” Mulino said. “That is sealed. The canal belongs toPanama.”Tension and defiance in Panama after Trump threatens to ‘take back’ canalRead moreThe canal, an 82km (51-mile) artificial waterway that connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and is key to global trade flows, is operated by the Panama Canal Authority – an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government.The US built the canal in the early 20th century and handed control to Panama in 1999, two decades after signing a set of treaties guaranteeing its permanent neutrality.But Trump has said that this treaty is being violated, claiming China controls the canal and has soldiers present there, without offering evidence. He also argues the US is being overcharged for transit through the canal.“I have received absolutely no information from the US embassy in Panama … nor from the secretary of state, with whom we work together on migration issues, about the alleged military presence of another country in the canal,” Mulino added.“The Panama Canal is controlled by Panama and its administration has always been in Panamanian hands,” he said.Panama had many other issues to discuss with Rubio, Mulino said, such as migration and drug trafficking.While the canal is operated by Panama, two ports at its Atlantic and Pacific entrances are operated by the publicly listed Hong Kong company CK Hutchison, while other ports nearby are operated by private firms from the United States, Singapore and Taiwan.Asked whether Panama could remove concessions from companies linked to China, Mulino said this was not on the table, and said the government was awaiting the results of an accounting into CK Hutchison’s payments to the state, an audit that was announced shortly after Trump’s accusations.“This is not a country that takes away and breaks laws. If I do that because they are Chinese companies or take away a concession just like that because someone asked me to, that is not the climate we want to project as a country to foreign investors,” he said. “Panama respects the rule of law.”Explore more on these topicsPanamaPanama canalUS foreign policyMarco RubioAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Many interpreted Trump’s move as an attempt to further demonize undocumented migrants by conflating them with the terror suspects who were imprisoned at Guantánamo’s detention centre after the then secretary of defense Rumsfeld opened it for “enemy combatants” three months after the 11 September 2001 attacks.“This is political theater and part of the Trump administration’s broader effort to paint immigrants as threats in the United States … and fan anti-immigrant sentiment,” said Eleanor Acer, the senior director for refugee protection at the advocacy group Human Rights First.Vincent Warren, head of the Center for Constitutional Rights legal advocacy group, said: “Trump’s order [sends] a clear message … Migrants and asylum seekers are being cast as the new terrorist threat, deserving to be discarded in an island prison, removed from legal and social services and supporters”.There was even stronger condemnation in Latin America, from where many of the migrants expected to end up in Trump’s camp hail. Aneditorialin Mexico’s leftwing newspaper La Jornada called the move “institutionalized sadism” and a Trumpian “spectacle of violence” designed to excite hardcore supporters. “The reopening of an international symbol of human rights abuses is a signal to Trumpists who believe the workers of the global south deserve the same punishment as supposed members of al-Qaida and the Islamic State,” it said.“What Trump is doing in sending migrants to Guantánamo – a place of torture and death – makes me think that the author of the book about Trump being the antichrist is on to something,” tweeted the Brazilian theologian Leonardo Boff.Adam Isacson, a migration expert from the Washington Office on Latin America thinktank, said Trump’s headline-grabbing initiative was “absolutely part of the narrative” that a military response was needed to tackle the supposed threat from migrants, whom the recently installed US president has repeatedly cast as dangerous “animals” and “trash”.“And the idea is to just scare the hell out of immigrant communities all around the United States too,” Isacson added. “They’re just trying to scare people and maybe scare people into just making their own arrangements and leaving the country on their own. This is all shock and awe.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those migrants have been held in a separate part of the base from alleged terrorists, 15 of whom are now imprisoned there, compared with hundreds after al-Qaida’s 9/11 attacks. The most notorious isKhalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged Pakistani mastermind of that plot.It remains uncertain precisely whom Trump might send to his expanded Guantánamo camp and whether it will be used to hold migrants accused or convicted of crimes or simply anyone lacking documents.Acer said the “outrageously vague and incredibly sweeping language” in Trump’s memorandum ordering Guantánamo’s expansion meant it was unclear who would be targeted. The three-paragraph directive calls for “all appropriate actions” to be taken to expand the facility in order to “address attendant immigration enforcement needs”.However, the activist called the president’s comment that the base was “tough” to escape “a disturbing signal that the Trump administration may be planning to hold people there indefinitely”.During George W Bush’s “war on terror”, “the US chose to hold people on the Guantánamo base because they believed that it would be removed from legal scrutiny,” Acer recalled.Now she suspected Trump also planned to treat it “as a sort of rights-free zone”. “The whole thing is just absurd … Guantánamo is essentially designed to prevent outside scrutiny. Human rights abuses will be hidden,” Acer warned, adding: “The Trump administration is thumbing its nose at the law and the rule of law.”Explore more on these topicsGuantánamo BayUS immigrationTrump administrationDonald TrumpCubaUS politicsAmericasanalysisShareReuse this content"

Smith, 78, was performing with the Berlin groupSoundwalk Collective, in which she recites her writing to a musical backing.Associated Press reported that the newspaper Folha de S Paulo said that Smith passed out about 30 minutes into the event while reading a piece about the climate crisis. After falling, she was taken backstage in a wheelchair.Smith returned to the stage to apologise for having to cut the performance short. “Unfortunately, I got sick, and the doctor said I can’t finish,” she told the crowd from the wheelchair. “So we will have to figure something out. And I feel very badly.”The crowd responded: “Don’t be, we love you.”Posting on Instagram, the collective said that despite her migraine, Smith “still wanted to be there for all of us and you and perform today” – Wednesday, the final date of a run of South American tour dates.“She is now being cared for by the best doctors in the most loving way and will be back on stage tomorrow night [Thursday],” the collective said.Smith also signed the statement, which continued: “Patti says that she is tremendously grateful for your patience and forgiveness and she sends her love to all who attended.”In March, artists including Michael Stipe, Kim Gordon, Karen O of Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Chrissie Hynde and Susanna Hoffs of the Bangles will perform ata tribute concertmarking 50 years of Smith’s canonical punk album Horses.They asked fans to “refrain from posing [footage] at this sensitive moment”. Nevertheless, videos posted online showed Smith lying on the ground at the Cultura Artística theatre.Patti Smith and Soundwalk Collective have collaborated on several albums since 2016, the most recent of which,The Perfect Vision: Reworkings, was released in 2022. Smith’s last solo album wasBanga, released in 2012. In the meantime, she has written several acclaimed books, includingM TrainandYear of the Monkey.In December 2023, she was briefly hospitalised in Italy for a “sudden illness”. In 2020, shetold the Guardianthat she had struggled during the pandemic owing to a lifelong bronchial condition that kept her indoors. “To be in limbo almost 10 months, for a person like me who doesn’t like sitting in the same place, it’s been very challenging,” she said. “I feel like I’m part-wolf, roaming from room to room.”Explore more on these topicsPatti SmithBrazilPunkAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But in 1874, the annuities were capped at $4 a person and never increased.In July, a scathing andunanimous decisionreleased by Canada’s top court criticized the federal and Ontario governments for their “dishonourable” conduct around the treaty, which left First Nations people to struggle in poverty while surrounding communities, industry and government exploited the abundant natural resources to enrich themselves.“Today, in what can only be described as a mockery of the crown’s treaty promise to the Anishinaabe of the upper Great Lakes, the annuities are distributed to individual treaty beneficiaries by giving them $4 each,” the court wrote, singling out the “shocking” figure paid to beneficiaries. “The crown has severely undermined both the spirit and substance of the Robinson treaties.”Twenty-one signatories of the Robinson Huron treaty, a separate agreement also signed in 1850, settled out of court for C$10bn, but the Superior group pushed further through the courts to determine how much the federal and provincial governments owe.In July, the supreme court ordered Ontario and the federal government to wrap negotiations with the Anishnaabe nations within six months. The deadline for an offer was 26 January.In a press release, the nations said they had only been offered C$3.6bn, a figure that “ignored the economic evidence about how much wealthCanadaand Ontario took from our lands”, said King, the chief of Gull Bay First Nation.“The [crown] consigned our communities to intergenerational poverty while they appropriated tremendous benefits for themselves. They continue to deny to our communities what we have lost as a result of their breaches,” he said. “Their decision today does not make up for 175 years of refusing to share the wealth of our lands.”In previous testimony, the Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said the amount due to the nations could approach C$126bn.“If you’ve owed somebody something, year after year after year, for 170 years, it’s a lot of money,” he told the court in February 2023.Signatories of the treaty plan say they will ask Patricia Hennessy of the Ontario superior court of justice to determine the amount they are rightfully owed.Chief Patricia Tangie of Michipicoten First Nation said the fight was about both previous losses and future generations.“Just as our ancestors in 1850 sought to secure benefits for their descendants, we today also take our role seriously for our next seven generations. We are carrying on with this struggle so that our children and grandchildrendo not have to sufferlike so many of our people have for more than a century and a half,” she said.“That suffering continues to include poverty, poor health and shortened life expectancy.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasIndigenous peoplesnewsShareReuse this content"

Microsoft, currently OpenAI’s biggest shareholder, also joined that roundLast weekOpenAIand SoftBank teamed up with Oracle to form Stargate, which Donald Trump called “the largest AI infrastructure project in history”. The partnership aims to build datacentres for AI systems, with an initial spend of $100bn.Citing multiple sources with knowledge of the talks,the FT saidSoftBank’s equity investment would cover the Japanese company’s commitment to Stargate. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and an influential figure in the Trump administration, has claimed Stargate’s backers “don’t actually have the money”.OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, replied on Musk’s social media platform, X, that the funding claims were wrong: “This is great for the country. I realize what is great for the country isn’t always what’s optimal for your companies, but in your new role I hope you’ll mostly put US first.”OpenAI received a competitive jolt this month fromthe emergence of the Chinese rival DeepSeek, after its latest chatbot went to the top of the Apple free app store and sent AI-linked stocks plunging on Monday.Although Altman initially said that he was impressed with DeepSeek and that it was “legitimately invigorating to have a new competitor”, the company later said it had evidence that Chinese startups were “constantly”using OpenAI’s technology to develop competing products.The OpenAI equity investment proposal, led by the SoftBank chief executive, Masayoshi Son, has been vetted by senior executives and the board at OpenAI, the FT reported.

We thank all those who have stood by him, and those who have shared his legacy throughout his political life from pre-independence to the time of his passing.“He was a political icon transcending generations and his legacy will remain forever in the pages of our history books and moreso in the hearts of so many.”The office of the prime minister, James Marape, issued a statement expressing “profound sadness … His passing comes at a pivotal moment in our nation’s history, as Papua New Guinea prepares to celebrate 50 years of independence – a milestone he played a crucial role in achieving. As we reflect on our journey as a nation, we must also honour the legacy of great leaders like Sir Julius, whose vision, courage, and leadership helped shape the Papua New Guinea we know today.”The news of his death sparked an outpouring of grief across the nation, with citizens expressing their sorrow on social media and in public gatherings. Flags were being flown at half-mast on Thursday and memorial services organised in his honour.Born to a migrant Chinese father and an Indigenous mother, Chan overcame significant challenges to become a prominent political figure. His leadership was characterised by a commitment to national unity and development, making him a beloved figure among many Papua New Guineans.His death will have a profound impact among Papua New Guineans who remember him as a pivotal figure in the country’s journey towards independence and development. Chan served as prime minister twice and was a key architect of Papua New Guinea’s political landscape. Across more than five decades he played a crucial role in guiding the country after it gained full independence from Australia in 1975. He served as a member of parliament for New Ireland province, and remained its governor at the time of his death.Chan’s autobiography, Playing the Game, offers insights into his life and the complexities of his political journey, reflecting on the cultural and historical contexts that shaped his decisions. He is survived by his wife, Lady Stella Chan, and children Vanessa, Byron, Mark and Toea.Explore more on these topicsPapua New GuineaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Residents living within a 200-metre radius of the site have been told to evacuate due to concerns about an underground gas pipe in the area.Attempts to retrieve the man, who has not been named by Japanese media, were temporarily halted in the early hours of Wednesday after a second sinkhole appeared. A videoclipshowed workers start to run for cover as a restaurant signboard and telegraph pole were swallowed by the second sinkhole.The two holes have now joined to form a bigger gap in the road, the public broadcaster NHK said, as rescue attempts entered their third day.Local officials believe the first collapse was probably caused by a ruptured sewage pipe, and the second by leaking wastewater that had loosened the surrounding soil, NHK added.View image in fullscreenFirefighters work to rescue a truck driver after his vehicle was swallowed up by a sinkhole at a prefectural road intersection, in the city of Yashio, Saitama Prefecture on 28 January, 2025.Photograph: JIJI Press/AFP/Getty ImagesConcern is mounting for the man’s welfare. Media reports said he was initially able to talk to emergency workers soon after the incident, but did not respond when firefighters called out to him later the same day.Water began accumulating in the hole on Wednesday morning, submerging the driver’s seat, the Asahi Shimbun reported, adding that the man’s condition was unknown.The prefectural government decided to discharge wastewater into a nearby river in an effort to reduce the flow of water into the sinkholes, while 1.2 million residents in nearby towns and cities have been told to use less water.It remains unclear when the sewage pipe will be fixed, the Mainichi Shimbun said, adding that the wastewater was being disinfected with chlorine before being released into the river.Officials believe the first hole formed due to corrosion in the sewer pipe, which runs 10 metres below ground. They suspect soil and sand found their way into the pipe, creating a hollow that collapsed under the weight of vehicles.“We can’t rule out the possibility of the sinkhole expanding,” the governor of Saitama prefecture, Motohiro Ono, told reporters on Wednesday.Evacuated residents have been forced to spend the night a municipal government office and other facilities.“I never thought the sinkhole would become so serious,” a local man told the Yomiuri Shimbun. Another said: “It’s worrying to think another sinkhole may form near my house.

Hehas acknowledgedin comments not cited in the complaint that “some Gazans will be people of good character, potentially able and willing to integrate into a democratic nation and subscribe to its values”, and that some “despise” Hamas, while calling for Australia to restrict the granting of humanitarian visas to Palestinians fleeing Gaza without thorough background checks.A Birchgrove Legal spokesperson said the firm was confident it could demonstrate Dutton’s comments that were cited in the complaint had contravened the Racial Discrimination Act.“We need to demonstrate that everything he did was not reasonable and not in good faith and we think he has made that easy for us because he’s been quite relentless and persistent in his commentary,” they said in a statement.Section 18C of the act states that it is unlawful for someone to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person based on their race. The complaint also cites section 9 which makes racial discrimination unlawful.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He faces more than 50 charges including criminal damage, burglary, shop theft and theft of a motor vehicle.‘Giant colouring book’: how money and paint mix in Melbourne’s street art sceneRead more“In one of the most high-profile incidents, it’s alleged the man scaled and defaced the heritage listed Flinders Street railway station clock tower on 10 July 2024,” police said.View image in fullscreenPam the Bird graffiti on an apartment building in Melbourne.Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian“It’s alleged he is also responsible for graffiti plastered across the rail network as well as the ‘Cheese Stick’ column on CityLink, a television station building in Docklands and concrete silos on Mercer Street in Geelong.“In the latest incident graffiti was on 20 January 2025 daubed across a hotel in South Wharf.”Police alleged the graffiti has caused more than $100,000 in damage in total.“The man has also been charged over an incident in Footscray where an allegedly stolen car was driven through the front window of a Barkly Street restaurant early on 20 December 2024,” police said.Police alleged they had also seized spray paint, illegal fireworks, abseiling equipment and property suspected to be the proceeds of crime.The man has been remanded to appear at Melbourne magistrates court on Friday.The underground graffiti movement has thrived for decades across the globe, and Melbourne is regarded as one of its most significant cities.Within this movement, the ability to paint quickly and skilfully without being caught – despite the risks posed by moving trains and increasingly motivated law enforcement – is highly valued, one artist told Guardian Australia this week.Dean Sunshine, who has spent years documenting and curating street art in Melbourne, summed up the fascination behind Pam the Bird as “location, location, location”.“It’s the most prolific thing in Melbourne right now … it gets a lot of respect from the graffiti world because of the amount of artwork that’s going up and the positions of the artwork,” he said.“It’s the positions … and getting to spots that are really hard to get to. That’s what’s making Pam the Bird such a legendary part of Melbourne graffiti culture.”Allow Facebook content?This article includes content provided by Facebook.

This is out and out vandalism, and it needs to stop,” he said. “This is not a victimless crime. The city’s pride and reputation is being affected.”He pointed to Melbourne’s designated legal spaces for street art, mostnotably famed Hosier Lane, which also features government-commissioned murals and artwork spruiking brands.“Pam the bird, could go quite some way improving the quality of the art, and we’re here to help on that front. We can give artistic guidance,” he said.But a veteran graffitist told Guardian Australia that it was frustrating that governments openly welcomed places like Hosier Lane, but cracked down on graffiti. It was the same as a government saying it loved AFL but hated community Australian rules teams – it was impossible for there to be one without the other.The Victorian opposition leader, Brad Battin, this month unveiled a proposal to require the Department of Transport and Planning to remove graffiti from public freeways within 24 hours.Police have also arrested a 39-year-old man from Abbotsford as part of the investigation.He has been charged with more than 20 criminal damage offences relating to the alleged graffiti of suburban trains and the Docklands office building, and was also due to appear in court today.Explore more on these topicsMelbourneStreet artVictorianewsShareReuse this content"

Both groups wanted honesty, competence and reform – but the difference was in their faith in mainstream parties to deliver it, the thinktank said.Outsiders felt they were victims of a system run by remote elites serving their own interests instead of implementing simple solutions to political problems. They placed greater value on “common sense” over independent evidence, and strong, decisive leaders over negotiation and compromise.View image in fullscreenSupporters of the National Rally leader, Marine Le Pen, cheer in Henin-Beaumont, northern France, at projections of her vote share in the first round of elections, 30 June 2024.Photograph: Thibault Camus/APIn the UK, older voters were likelier to be outsiders, while inFranceand Germany – where the far-right National Rally and Alternative for Germany have surged in popularity – younger and older voters were equally likely to be outsiders.Across the countries surveyed, there was a high degree of economic pessimism among voters, who expected children born today to be worse off than their parents. This feeling was most acute in the UK – where 49% expected children to be worse off, compared with 26% who expected them to be better off – and in Australia and France.The report found that this economic pessimism was linked to declining faith in democracy. Of those voters who said they had negative views about democracy, 77% said they believed that children born today would be worse off than their parents.Voters generally thought that technology made their lives better, but were ambivalent about its impact on public services. Asked how optimistic they were about potential improvements brought about by AI, most placed themselves between a three and seven out of 10. Outsiders who were distrustful of politicians were much more pessimistic about technology.The report concluded that “the key to bringing coalitions back together is effective delivery” and “paradoxically, modern technology can offer part of an answer”. It suggested that, for example, introducing digital IDs, which the UK government has backed, could help assuage concerns about controlling immigration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the same time, credible answers must be provided for legitimate grievances, including around immigration.”Rob Ford, a professor of political science at the University of Manchester, said the report reflected that “while the TBI has provided us with an elegant and rigorous report to give us a diagnosis of the problem, they don’t offer much by way of a cure. I’m not sure anyone has the answer.”He added: “The central conundrum of our times is: is there any kind of deliverable performance for any government that voters will reward? We’re seeing every single incumbent getting kicked out whatever they do, whatever they support, whatever narrative they promote.“Take a typical Reform voter – they will say, ‘here’s a list I demand that the government do’. Some of those things are impossible for any government to do. They will say they want net migration down to zero and major improvements to the healthcare system, and also lower taxes. How? If you deliver any one of those things you are making it drastically harder to deliver the others.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThinktanksThe far rightFar rightGermanyFranceCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

I just hate al-Qaida. I hate that we have leaders who cozy up to Islamist extremists.”Gabbard, who was dressed in a snow-white pantsuit and sweater, responded in an even baritone as she toned down her criticism of the US intelligence apparatus, including her past efforts to shutter theFisa Section 702law that allows electronic surveillance abroad without a warrant. She now supports reauthorizing the law.“I don’t find your change of heart credible,” said Mark Warner, the committee’s head vice-chair, indicating that and her past support for Snowden were key concerns for members of the committee.Gabbard’s hearing was a tightrope walk. A majority of members of the Senate intelligence committee must support her in order for her candidacy to advance to a floor vote in the Senate. A number of US media including Fox News on Thursday reported that she did not yet have the votes to win confirmation.Her candidacy was also endangered by a series of recent leaks in the press. The New York Times this week reported that US intelligence had intercepted a phone call between two Hezbollah operatives who said thatGabbard had met with “the big guy” during a visit to Lebanon in 2017, indicating a senior Hezbollah official.During the hearing, Gabbard denied having met with Hezbollah operatives and said it was an “absurd accusation”.Those ties to foreign governments were a key concern of members of the committee before the hearing. “There is real concern about her contacts [in Syria] and that she does not share the same sympathies and values as the intelligence community,” a person familiar with discussions among senior intelligence officialspreviously told the Guardian. “She is historically unfit.”During the hearing, the Colorado senator Michael Bennet attacked Gabbard for a tweet sent out just hours afterRussialaunched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in which she said: “This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia’s legitimate security concerns.”While she did not explain those remarks, she did indicate that she had had a change of heart. Asked bluntly who she blamed for the war between Russia and Ukraine, she said: “Putin started the invasion of Ukraine.”Yet the strongest questions regarded her past support for Snowden, whom she admitted had broken US laws by taking a trove of top secret intelligence documents while working as a contractor for the National Security Agency and later leaking them to media, including the Guardian.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s not a moment to propagate conspiracy theories … This is when you need to answer questions of the people whose votes you’re asking for.”Tracking Trump cabinet confirmations – so farRead moreThose questions were foreseen by Snowden himself, who wrote in a tweet on Thursday that Gabbard would be “required to disown all prior support for whistleblowers as a condition of confirmation”.“I encourage her to do so. Tell them I harmed national security and the sweet, soft feelings of staff,” he said. “In DC, that’s what passes for the pledge of allegiance.”The committee is expected to hold a closed session to discuss sensitive matters later on Thursday and then would move to a vote “as soon as possible”. said Tom Cotton, the committee chair.“Obviously we didn’t select this nominee,” said Bennet, Gabbard’s most vocal skeptic. “But can’t we do better than somebody who doesn’t believe in [Fisa law] 702?

What happened in the Bundestag on Wednesday reminded me ofGermanyin 1933 of how Hitler and the Nazi party managed to come to power through legitimate means.”View image in fullscreenAlbrecht Weinberg: ‘What happened in the Bundestag on Wednesday reminded me of Germany in 1933 of how Hitler and the Nazi party managed to come to power through legitimate means.’Photograph: Focke Strangmann/Getty ImagesWeinberg, who survived Auschwitz along with his brother and sister, said he had decided “very spontaneously” to hand back his medal “because I was very upset about the voting in the Bundestag”.On Wednesday, the conservative alliance of the Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) submitted a non-binding motion for a plan that aims to make it policy to turn migrants and asylum seekers away at the German border, and to enable security forces to more easily deport foreigners in Germany.Auschwitz: 80 years after its liberation, three survivors tell their storiesRead moreFriedrich Merz, the leader of the CDU and the man likely to become the next chancellor after elections later this month,was urged not to use the AfDto get the motion through by opposition members, who said it breached Germany’s longstanding taboo to keep a “firewall” between the far right and the mainstream.His decision was even criticised on Thursday by the former chancellor and CDU leader Angela Merkel who,in a rare interventioninto German politics, rebuked him for reneging on a promise not to cooperate, even “by accident”, with the AfD.Weinberg, who was given Germany’s highest honour for his work in schools raising awareness of the Holocaust, said he was shocked but not surprised by the motion.He said: “The Nazis wanted to get rid of my family even though we were German citizens, and they succeeded in murdering my parents and almost killed me and my siblings. Now these politicians want to chase everyone out who they don’t like. Did they learn nothing from the second world war? I really wonder whether I should be packing my suitcase again.”View image in fullscreenWeinberg sits inside his old classroom at the former Jewish school.Photograph: Focke Strangmann/Getty ImagesHe said he had already been chilled by the historical parallels he saw between the AfD’s tactics and those of the Nazi party after recent reports that the AfD had been distributingflyers designed to resemble plane tickets for deportationthat were addressed to “illegal immigrants”.“It reminded me precisely of how the SA [the paramilitary wing of the Nazi party] had printed small tickets at the local printing press and rang the bell of our house handing one to my father, a one-way ticket … telling him ‘don’t come back’,” he said.Weinberg, who grew up in the village of Fehndorf Rhauderfehn in East Frisia, northern Germany and will turn 100 in March, was forced into Nazi slave labour in 1939. He and his sister, Friedel, were sent to Auschwitz in April 1943 at the same time as, but separately from, their older brother, Dieter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “We’re friends. I called her because I was so disturbed – she said she’ll come and see me in a week or two to explain why. What can you do?”The photographer Luigi Toscano from Mannheim, a friend of Weinberg’s whose project Lest We Forget documented the stories of 400 survivors of the Holocaust, also said he was returning his order of merit. He was prepared to take Weinberg with him and hand it back to President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in Berlin personally, he said. “Either the president will receive us or we’ll throw the medals into his letterbox,” he told the broadcaster ARD.Wednesday’s vote came two days after a memorial at Auschwitz on the80th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death campin 1945.The vote led to criticism from all sides of the mainstream political spectrum. In a statement on her website, Merkel said she stood by her longstanding conviction that there should never be any association between the mainstream parties and the far-right populists.She wrote: “I think it is wrong to no longer feel bound to this proposal [Merz’s promise not to cooperate with the AfD], thereby allowing a majority with the votes of the AfD in a vote in the German Bundestag for the first time on 29 January 2025.”Eva Umlauf, 82, who survived Auschwitz and in 2015 told the Guardianthe story of how she was deported therewith her mother in 1944, also compared the vote to the situation in 1930s Germany.In a letter to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, she wrote: “We all know how German politicians once thought they could cooperate with Hitler and the Nazi party. Keep them in check. And how in just a few years, our democracy became a dictatorship. Peace became war.”Explore more on these topicsHolocaustGermanyAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)The far rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities did not say whether the shooter was among those detained.Momika, an Iraqi refugee with a chequered past,outraged many peoplein Sweden andaround the worldby burning copies of the Qur’an in public demonstrations.A Stockholm court dismissed the case against Momika after his death. It said the verdict for another man in the same criminal trial over “offences of agitation against an ethnic or national group” would be postponed until Monday.‘It’s a racism crisis’: call for action on Qur’an burnings in SwedenRead moreUlf Kristersson, the Swedish prime minister, told reporters there were fears the killing could have been linked to another country. “I can assure you that the security services are deeply involved because there is obviously a risk that there is a connection to a foreign power,” he said.The deputy prime minister, Ebba Busch, condemned the murder. “It is a threat to our free democracy. It must be met with the full force of our society,” she wrote on X.The security service said police were leading the investigation but “we are following the development of events closely to see what impact this may have on Swedish security”.Last year the service said the Iranian government had been using criminal networks within Sweden to carry out violent acts against other states, groups and individuals.Swedish media reported Momika was streaming live on TikTok when he was shot. A video seen by Reuters showed police picking up a phone and ending a live stream that appeared to be from his TikTok account.In 2023 Sweden raised its terrorism alert to the second highest level and warned of threats against Swedes at home and abroad after Qur’an burnings, many of them by Momika, angered many Muslims and prompted threats from jihadists.On one occasion in June 2023, he stomped on the Islamic holy book and wrapped it in bacon before lighting a few pages on fire, slamming it shut and kicking it like a football.Iraqi protesters stormed the Swedish embassy in Baghdad twice in July 2023, starting fires within the compound on the second occasion.While the Swedish government condemned the wave of burnings, it was initially regarded as a protected form of free speech.The burnings of the holy book, by Momika and others, complicated Sweden’s entry into Nato. Turkey suspended talks with Sweden on its Nato application in January 2023 after Rasmus Paludan, a Swedish-Danish activist who had been convicted for racist abuse,burned a copy of the Qur’an outside the Turkish embassy in Stockholm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There was a price on his head,” Roth said.In March 2024, Momika left Sweden to seek asylum in Norway, telling Agence France-Presse that Sweden’s freedom of expression and protection of human rights was “a big lie”. Norway deported him back to Sweden only weeks later.Sweden’s migration agency wanted to deport Momika for giving false information on his residency application but could not as it was deemed he could face torture and inhumane treatment in Iraq.With Reuters and AFPExplore more on these topicsSwedenEuropeIslamnewsShareReuse this content"

For the first time the AfD, second in the polls beforethe election on 23 February, was instrumental in helping a mainstream party towards a parliamentary majority. The pro-business FDP also contributed to the motion’s success.Olaf Scholz attacks rival’s ‘unforgivable mistake’ as AfD backs migration planRead moreAccording to the plan, some migrants and asylum seekers could be turned away at the German border, and more easily deported.Merz, who became leader of the CDU in December 2021, has always been outspoken in his opposition toMerkel’s so-called open-door policyunder which around a million migrants entered Germany in 2015, saying it “should not be allowed to happen again”.In her recently published memoirs, Merkel, who had previously blocked Merz’s rise to power in the CDU, said she “did not begrudge” her old rival the position of chancellor, saying she recognised in him the “unconditional desire to have power” that was necessary to take on the role.Merkel was praised for her comments published on Thursday, including by Saskia Esken, co-leader of the Social Democrats (SPD), the senior partner in the coalition government beforeparliament was dissolved. “She clearly has the impression that she has to remind Friedrich Merz of his political responsibility,” she told Die Zeit. “I’m very grateful to her.”Merz had said before the vote that he was reluctantly open to the notion that his proposal would only succeed if it received AfD support. After the vote he continued to assert that he had no intention of working with the AfD. But he faced widespread criticism for what some said was his breaking of a “firewall”, according to which the mainstream parties have pledged not to cooperate or coalesce with the AfD.Speaking at the ballot box after the vote he said: “I want to repeat … that I’m not looking for any other majority other than in the democratic centre of our parliament.”He said he regretted that such a majority had not been possible, which drew derisive laughter and heckles from the benches of the SPD, Greens and the far-left Die Linke.Merz has faced criticism from the SPD and the Greens, the constituent parts of Olaf Scholz’s minority government, for failing to try to reach a compromise with them after they put proposals for migration reform on the table that they say have been largely ignored by the opposition.The AfD, which has called the “firewall” undemocratic and is seeking a coalition with the CDU/CSU, has been celebrating what it sees as a victory and a sign it can no longer be ignored.The most quoted response in German media from the AfD since the vote was that of MP Bernd Baumann, who said: “This is truly a historic moment … Mr Merz, you helped bring it about and now you stand here with shaking knees, trembling and apologising,” he said, before declaring: “Here and now a new epoch begins.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyAngela MerkelEuropeMigrationThe far rightAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)Olaf ScholznewsShareReuse this content"

Skinny in his grey Israeli prison tracksuit, his head shaved, Zakaria Zubeidi lifted two fingers to make a peace sign and gestured at jubilant crowds.The 49-year-old, a former leader of a Palestinian militant group jailed for attacks that killed several Israelis, was among 110 Palestinian prisoners freed in exchange forthree Israelis and five Thai nationalsheld by Palestinian militants in Gaza. The prisoners’ release was delayed by Israeli officials, who expressed dismay at the chaotic scenes in Gaza that accompanied the Israelis’ transfer to the custody of the Red Cross.Twelve people were treated for gunshot wounds and teargas inhalation as they awaited the release of the detainees outside Ofer prison near Ramallah. AFP said 300 Palestinians waited outside a municipal complex nearby on the city’s outskirts, hoping to greet their loved ones amid delays.“I am so tired. This isn’t fair,” Raghed Nasser, 21, told AFP as she waited for her father, Hussein, jailed 22 years ago while her mother was pregnant with her.Those due for release included some of the oldest prisoners serving life sentences for violent crimes, among them Mohammed Falna from Ramallah, detained for 33 years, and Mohammad Abu Warda from Hebron, jailed 23 years ago for his role in two bus bombings in Jerusalem in 1996 that killed 45 people.It also included 15-year-old Muhammad Lutfi Ali from the Shuafat refugee camp in East Jerusalem, the youngest of 30 minors freed.View image in fullscreenZubeidi makes victory signs from a Red Cross bus as he is being released.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyZubeidi’s uncle Jamal said tears came to his eyes when he received news that his nephew would walk free. “Our joy was mixed with sadness and severe pain, because of Zakaria’s son,” he said.Zubeidi’s 21-year-old son Mohammed was killed when an Israeli drone struck the car he was riding in last September. Zubeidi’s brother Daoud died of his wounds from a shootout with Israeli forces three years ago.All three of Zubeidi’s brothers were killed by Israeli forces during his time in detention. The former fighter once said he learned of his father’s death through a mosque loudspeaker while imprisoned in Jenin. Zubeidi turned to militancy after Israeli forces shot his mother in the Jenin refugee camp through a window.To Israelis, Zubeidi is a notorious criminal jailed multiple times for attacks on civilians, including a 2002 attack on a polling station in northern Israel that killed six people, but to Palestinians he has folk hero status.The former head of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade took part in an audaciousprison breakfrom a maximum-security facility in 2021, two years into his sentence for alleged connections to shooting attacks close to the Israeli settlement of Beit El.Zubeidei, 49, was the most high-profile of the six Palestinian escapers, who were recaptured a week later in northern Israel and returned to prison.The Zubeidi family were hoping to welcome him back to Jenin, where he became a director of the Freedom Theatre in the camp in 2008, declaring it his chosen method of fighting Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and renouncing violence. But Jenin has been the scene of a major incursion by Israeli forces that began shortly after the Gaza ceasefire deal on Gaza came into effect.The operation, which Israel has namedIron Wall, has since expanded to include military raids on the Tulkarem refugee camp. Ten Palestinians were killed overnight in an Israeli airstrike on the town of Tammoun, near Tubas.Israeli forces say they are targeting Palestinian militants across the West Bank, while theUN has raised concernsabout “the use of unlawful lethal force in Jenin”. Israeli military bulldozers penetrated deep into the camp.Hundreds flee Jenin amid Israel’s deepening West Bank crackdownRead more“The current situation is very difficult and I don’t think Zakaria will return to the camp right away, because of the invasion. He may stay in Ramallah for a few days,” said Jamal.“Because of the invasion and the sad events in the camp, we can’t celebrate properly,” he said.The future of Zubeidi’s Freedom Theatre remains in question, after an Israeli raid and the detention of its directors in December 2023. “After Zakaria’s return, the theatre could resume its activities if things calm down, and return to normal, but it doesn’t seem like that will happen,” said Jamal.The Turkish news agency Anadolu said Israeli forces raided Zubeidi’s home in the Jenin camp last week in anticipation of his release, handcuffing his 14-year-old son and ordering the family not to celebrate when he returns.Explore more on these topicsWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsraelHamasIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Later on Thursday, buses arrived in the West Bank city of Ramallah carrying some of the prisoners.It was not the first crisis in a ceasefire deal that is not yet two weeks old. Yehoud had originally been listed for release on Saturday. When four female soldiers were handed over instead, Israel accusedHamasof violating the deal and suspended plans to allow Palestinian civilians to return to northern Gaza.After last-minute negotiations, Hamas confirmed Yehoud would be freed on Thursday with two other hostages and Israel opened checkpoints to northern Gaza on Monday.Shortly after the Thursday handover of the seven hostages in southern Gaza, Trump’s envoy for the region, Steven Witkoff, made a brief visit to Hostage Square in Tel Aviv.View image in fullscreenCrowds gather in Khan Younis for the release of Palestinian hostages as part of a ceasefire and prisoner exchange deal between Hamas and Israel.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPAMany people, when they realised Witkoff was there, raced to pay personal tribute to him for brokering the ceasefire agreement. “Thank you for freeing the hostages, thank you to Mr Trump,” one shouted.He met families of hostages briefly in a public library beside the square, assuring them he was optimistic the deal would hold, Israeli media reported, and said he was committed to bringing home the living held in Gaza and the dead.International Unrwa staff leave as Israel’s ban on activity takes effectRead moreThe first stage of the ceasefire is due to last 42 days and covers the release of 33 Israeli hostages, mostly women and older men. Of the 23 still to be released as part of the first phase, Hamas says eight are dead. Under the agreement, Israel will free about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and increase aid into Gaza.Shortly after Thursday’s handover, Hamas confirmed the death of Mohammed Deif, the head of its military wing, six months after Israel announced he had been killed. It was the first statement that Hamas has released on Deif’s condition since the Israeli military said last August that he had been killed in an airstrike in southern Gaza the month before.Witkoff was visiting Israel before negotiations on the second phase of the deal, due to start on Monday, and went from Hostage Square to hold talks with Netanyahu. The Israeli leader faces heavy pressure from far-right members of his coalition to restart the war rather than extend the ceasefire.Trump’s envoy also visited Gaza with the Israeli military and met the four female soldiers freed on Saturday at the Israeli hospital where they were being treated.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I want to thank Trump,” he said. His hopes of seeing his son again rested entirely on the US leader, he added.He said that for one day he had put his own worries aside to celebrate, because after 15 months of intense campaigning, everyone held in Gaza feels like family. “I think all the time about [Omri’s return], but today I concentrate on the joy.”Miran was part of the crowd waiting in Hostages Square to watch the releases in real time, beside a clock broadcasting a countdown of the days, hours and minutes of the hostages’ captivity.Schoolchildren and parents pushing babies in prams mixed with adults who had taken the day off to be there for a “historic moment”, most veterans of the long campaign for a ceasefire deal.They cheered and wept when the first footage streamed from Gaza showed Berger walking unaided. Like the four other female soldiers freed last weekend, she was dressed in military-style fatigues and put on stage for a ceremony that served as a show of the militants’ power after 15 months of war.“She made it,” said Yahel Oren, 31, who served a decade ago at the Nahal Oz base, where Berger was captured by Hamas, and watched the video in tears. “It’s hard to think of her alone there, but at least we can count the minutes she has left.”View image in fullscreenPeople in Tel Aviv gather in Hostages Square to watch the release of hostages on a giant screen.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyOren was part of a group campaigning for the freedom of the female “spotter” troops held in Gaza, and was wearing a T-shirt saying: “Once a spotter always a spotter.”Attention then shifted to the south, where seven hostages were due to be freed.

They were later named as Thenna, Suwannakham, Sriaoun, Seathao and Rumnao.The release of Moses, the first Israeli man freed in this exchange, was taken by many in the crowd as a tacit acknowledgment that the last living women held in Gaza had been released.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesHamasBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

He did not say how many contractors were already in Gaza.UG Solutions’ role in the ceasefire deal has been reported, but the email disclosed previously unknown details including the aim of recruiting 96 veterans exclusively with US special operations forces backgrounds, the pay and the types of weapons they will carry. Emirati officials had suggested the use of private contractors as part of a post-war peacekeeping force in Gaza, and that the idea had caused concern among Western nations.The deployment of armed US contractors in Gaza, where Hamas remains a potent force after 14 months of war, is unprecedented and poses the risk that Americans could be drawn into fighting as Donald Trump’s administration seeks to keep the Hamas-Israel conflict from reigniting.Among the risks facing the Americans are gunfights with Islamist militants or Palestinians angry over Washington’s support for Israel’s Gaza offensive.“Of course there is a threat they will face,” said Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official.The document said the contractors will be armed with M4 rifles, which are used by the Israeli and US militaries, and Glock pistols.The rules of engagement governing when UG Solutions personnel can open fire have been finalized, the spokesperson said, but he declined to disclose them.“We have the right to defend ourselves,” he said. He declined to discuss how the company won the contract.The Israeli deputy foreign minister, Sharren Haskel, on Tuesday told reporters, without naming UG Solutions or the United States, that Israel had demanded that the deal include the use of a private security firm, working with “an Egyptian security company or forces” to help maintain security and humanitarian aid flows in Gaza.But, she said, it remained to be seen if the arrangement “actually works”. Earlier rounds of ceasefire negotiations were held up by an Israeli demand to staff the checkpoint with its own troops.A Palestinian official close to the talks confirmed US contractors would also be at the checkpoint, at the intersection of the Netzarim Corridor dividing northern and southern Gaza and Salah al-Din Street, which separates the east and west of the enclave.The official said the US contractors would be deployed away from residents passing through and they must not deal with the local population.The UG Solutions email said its primary mission was “internal vehicle checkpoint management and vehicle inspection”.“We’re only focused on vehicles,” said the spokesperson.Israel mulls using private security contractors to deliver aid to GazaRead moreThe Israeli prime minister’s office declined to provide any further comment on the security arrangements. The US state department, Egypt’s foreign office and Hamas did not immediately respond to requests for comment. US use of private security firms has in the past led to disaster.In 2007, contractors for the now defunct Blackwater firm shot dead 14 civilians in Baghdad’s Al Nisour Square, igniting a diplomatic crisis and outraging Iraqis. Four Blackwater personnel were convicted in a US court and pardoned by Trump in his first term. Insurgents in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004 killed four Americans working for Blackwater and hung two of their bodies from a bridge, prompting a massiveUS militaryresponse.A separate source familiar with the deal said Israel and unnamed “Arab countries” that worked on the agreement are funding the consortium. The US government had no direct involvement in the decision to include a security company in the ceasefire deal or in the awarding of the contract, the source said.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warUS militaryIsraelEgyptMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

There were plans for a “celebration” by Israeli rightwingers, some of whom later vandalised signs and replaced the UN flag with an Israeli one.The agency said it had received no communications from Israel on how the ban would be implemented, most crucially over the delivery of aid to Gaza. However, Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesperson for the UN chief, António Guterres, said Unrwa would continue working in allPalestinian territories, including East Jerusalem.“Unrwa clinics across the occupiedWest Bank, including East Jerusalem, are open. Meanwhile, the humanitarian operations in Gaza continue, including with Unrwa work there,” she said.The Guardian understands that Unrwa trucks did cross from Israel toGazaon Thursday. It remained unclear how that was coordinated with Israeli officials.The implementation of the Israeli law banning Unrwa came on the same day that the Norwegian government said it would contribute $24m (£19m) to the agency.“Gaza is in ruins, and Unrwa’s help is more necessary than ever,” the Norwegian foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, said in a statement. “It is extremely dramatic for Palestine that Israeli laws come into force that in practice can prevent Unrwa from working.”The move was also condemned by the Spanish government. “The government rejects the entry into force of the Knesset laws that prevent Unrwa operations in the occupied Palestinian territories, and calls for their application to be suspended,” it said. “Spain expresses its deepest concern about the impact that this decision will have on the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories, jeopardising the ceasefire.”Beyond the largely empty headquarters compound, other Unrwa facilities in East Jerusalem continued working.Students in the Shuafat refugee camp in East Jerusalem, just beyond Israel’s concrete separation barrier with the West Bank, attended Unrwa classrooms as usual on Thursday morning.In Jerusalem’s Old City too, Manal Khayat, the head nurse at the Unrwa-run health centre, said that while Israeli authorities had told her two days earlier that they would shut down the clinic after the ban took effect, they had not specified when, and staff were not prevented from working on Thursday.“I don’t feel relieved yet, because we don’t know what will happen,” she said. “The main product of this whole decision is confusion and fear.”The Israeli ban went ahead on Thursday after the country’s supreme court rejected a petition by the Palestinian human rights group Adalahcontesting the new law.The court did note that the legislation “prohibits Unrwa activity only on the sovereign territory of the state of Israel” but did not prohibit such activity in Gaza and the West Bank. The ban does apply, however, to Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, where Unrwa has a field headquarters for its operations in the West Bank.About 25 international staff left on Wednesday after Israel refused to issue visas or extend existing ones. International staff make up about 2% of the agency’s workforce. “The headquarters is still there, and the flag is still up,” said Juliette Touma, an Unrwa spokesperson.“It’s a UN compound, which means it must be protected. We don’t have plans to close our operations,” she said. “But we are in the dark. We have not received any instructions from Israel how the ban will be enforced beyond being told to vacate.”Israel insists it is going ahead with Unrwa ban – what it may mean for PalestiniansRead moreThe most serious feared impact is in Gaza, where Unrwa is the largest agency delivering aid. Its trucks cross into Gaza from Israel, requiring coordination with the Israeli authorities.Touma said: “If [the ban means] no contact at an operational level, then the fate of the ceasefire is in serious jeopardy because we are the most serious player and biggest deliverer of aid.”Officially, Unrwa is now banned from operating on Israeli soil and contact between it and Israeli officials is also forbidden, although it is unclear what this might mean in practical terms.Set up in 1949 under a mandate from the UN general assembly, the agency has provided support for Palestinian refugees around the Middle East for over 70 years but has long faced attacks from Israeli officials. Its offices and staff in Israel play a major role in the provision of healthcare and education to Palestinians, including those living in the Gaza Strip, which has been devastated by the war between Israel and Hamas.The agency’s chief, Philippe Lazzarini, said Unrwa’s capacity to distribute aid “far exceeds that of any other entity”, describing Israel’s actions as a “relentless assault … harming the lives and future of Palestinians across the occupied Palestinian territory”.Israel has long campaigned against Unrwa, claiming its existence has prolonged the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. The hostility intensified after Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, with accusations that some Unrwa employees participated in the assault.Despite repeated claims by Israel that Unrwa had been infiltrated by Hamas on a large scale, a series of investigations, including one led by the former French foreign minister Catherine Colonna, found some “neutrality-related issues” at Unrwa but stressed Israel had not provided evidence for its headline allegation.Explore more on these topicsIsraelUnited NationsGazaWest BankMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

The central square of the city, home to one of Syria’s larger minority communities, hosts the crowds of weekly – or sometimes even daily – demonstrators calling for the representation and publicservices they have demanded for years.Long before the fall last month of the regime of Bashar al-Assad, the southern province of the same name had become a byword for resistance to rule by Damascus, unafraid to protest despite Assad’s crackdown on dissent and his hollow pledges to protect communities like theirs.Fear and uncertainty in Golan Heights as Israeli troops drive deeper into SyriaRead moreThe area is overwhelmingly filled with members of the Druze sect, who follow an esoteric form of Islam whose adherents span a swath of Lebanon and Syria, including theIsraeli-occupied Golan Heights. Even before Assad fled last month as an insurgency reached Damascus, residents of Suwayda had been demanding a secular state that enshrined minority rights, and are now emphatically insisting their voices be heard in the new Syria.“Since last August until now we’ve been protesting daily,” said Alia Kuntar, a lawyer, after the weekly demonstration held in Suwayda City’s central square in front of a metal pavilion emblazoned with the words “Peace to all Syrians”. “And we will keep protesting until we get the state we want. We haven’t felt any crackdown from the new government, but equally we didn’t see any action on the ground in response to our demands.”She added: “Of course, we’ll increase our demonstrations until we get what we want.”View image in fullscreenSoldiers from the Sheikhs of Dignity Druze militia group walk into their command centre in the outskirts of Suwayda.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianProtests in Suwayda began in August 2023 for increased public services and quickly spilled into demands for Assad to go, in a place that his regime had long ignored. The southern province was a rare pocket of resistance for well over a year before his rule collapsed amid a wider insurgency at the end of 2024. It now presents a challenge for Syria’s caretaker government, which is led by the Islamists who toppled Assad.Assad’s fall has quelled demands for a Druze state, but local religious figures, militia leaders and demonstrators say they are happy to be a thorn in the side of the new authorities.Protesters said their demands for improved public services and a secular state remained unchanged despite the new leadership in Damascus,putting the caretaker authority under pressure. Adding to this friction is an expanding Israeli presence around the Golan Heights, a mountainous region with a large Druze population that has been part-occupied by Israel for decades.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Druze militia at their command centre.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianSitting among the cobalt-blue furnishings of a meeting room outside Suwayda, the Druze militia leader Laith al-Balous, who heads the Sheikhs of Dignity armed faction, chose his words carefully when discussing how Damascus should respond to Israel’s expanding military presence. He said he believed Syria’s neighbours would respect Syrian sovereignty once Damascus relauncheed its military.As many as 5,000 members of Suwayda’s coalition of Druze militants were impatient to join an as-yet-unformed new Syrian army, he said, adding his group was waiting until that moment before any discussion of disarming itself.“It would be an honour for us to join the new army, providing the government in Damascus has a clear vision and strategy,” he said, delicately. “I sent a delegation to the new defence ministry, to understand the army’s strategy and fighting ideology. We want to know: who is our enemy in Syria?”The Druze in general, Balous said with a smile, “are optimistic about ties with Damascus, and expect to see benefits from the government there. If in future these don’t arrive, there are steps to be taken we can talk about in time. I’ve heard good statements from the Damascus caretaker government, but we’re waiting to see things implemented on the ground.”View image in fullscreenA Druze soldier from the Sheikhs of Dignity forces rests his head on a deceased leader’s grave at their command centre.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianLoyalty, Balous said, would come when the Druze saw how a new government performed. “But at the same time, we don’t want to wall ourselves off, we want to participate before drawing conclusions.”Yasser Hussein abu Fakher, a Druze religious leader and key member of the top religious council, said Suwayda’s religious and political representatives had sent “an olive branch to the new transitional government”, and welcomed Assad’s downfall.But the view from Suwayda was that the transitional leadership was not there to talk about its concerns. They had recently welcomed a visiting delegation from Damascus, Fakher said, but those ministers had come to check on their respective departments such as health and policing, not to discuss the formation of a civil state or how minority groups such as the Druze could be represented in future.“We prefer to call it a caretaker government, as until now it’s not elected, there’s no constitution or clear laws,” Fakher said. “We want a new government that should be a civil state, one that is democratic, respects all sects, and believes in freedom. This caretaker government cannot make decisions about the strategic direction of Syria.”View image in fullscreenYasser Hussein abu Fakher said the Druze wanted a democratic ‘civil state’ that ‘respects all sects and believes in freedom’.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianStanding outside the central mosque after the weekly protest, Kuntar said demonstrators were, however, impatient to see change. “We want to hear [transitional Syrian president]Ahmed al-Sharaa’s plan for how to change things after Assad,” she said. “But we’re yet to hear anything from him.”Komai Obeid, 24, a medical student, said he had joined some of the first anti-government protests in Suwayda but had been too frightened of arrest to continue. Now, he said, he was finally free of the fear protesting could see him arrested and was embracing protests as a form of political engagement with Damascus that was impossible under the Assad regime.“When the civil war in Syria started I was 10 years old – for my generation, there was no sense of belonging here and it was easier to call for separation,” he said. “But now, no way.”View image in fullscreenPeople gather outside the central Suwayda mosque after Friday prayers.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianObeid’s sense that the Druze community was cut off from the government in Damascus had evaporated as the Assad regime crumbled, and while he was once convinced he would graduate and leave the country, he now wanted to stay, he said. His determination to rebuild, he added, meant happily making demands of the new authority in Damascus.“Now if we feel we dislike anything about the country we can finally express it – and we want the government to help us build our new homeland,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIslamMiddle East and north AfricaReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

Photographs byDavid LeveneThu 30 Jan 2025 08.26 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 10.01 ESTShareAs the sun set on thesangam,the sacred meeting point of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers on Tuesday, there was a mood of jubilation on the banks. This was the eve of one of the holiest days of theKumbh Melafestival – the largest religious gathering not only in India but the world – and millions upon millions had made long, often arduous journeys to immerse themselves in the water.“It seems like the entire country has come to thesangamto bathe,” exclaimed Rubi Kumar, 43, sandwiched tightly with fellow devotees on the riverbank. She had taken a 36-hour train from her home state of Bihar, and then walked 25 miles to reach this spot. Still dripping wet from her first holy dip, she beamed widely as she tied up her soft pink sari.View image in fullscreenPilgrims bathe at the banks of the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers on MondayView image in fullscreenPeople sleep on plastic sheeting and under blankets out in the open“It was such a struggle to get here but now it feels like all the pain and agony has gone,” said Kumar. “It’s one of the most beautiful days of my life.” She planned to take one more dip at about 3am the next morning – the most auspicious time, on Wednesday – and then head hundreds of miles back home.Kumbh Mela: what is the Hindu ‘festival of festivals’?Read moreThe potent belief among the Hindu devotees gathering that evening was that to be cleansed in thesangamwaters over the next few hours – a period known asMauni Amavasya,marking a new moon – was to free their body of past sins and relinquish the endless cycle of birth and death. Some wept as they entered the freezing river, while others shouted out in euphoria or whispered prayers as they scattered flowers and poured cups of milk into the holy waters.The Kumbh Mela comes round just once every 12 years in the Uttar Pradesh city of Prayagraj, but this year was deemed particularly special as it was the “Maha” or great Kumbh Mela, marking the 12th in a row, which comes just once every 144 years amid a special alignment of the sun, moon, Jupiter and Saturn. By the government’s own projections, 400 million people are expected to attend by the time it finishes in February, the largest crowd in its history.View image in fullscreenPilgrims cross the River Ganges using one of 30-odd pontoon bridges in PrayagrajView image in fullscreenPilgrims bathe at sunrise on TuesdayIt had taken 45-year-old Vipul Rajgor and six members of his family 14 hours to drive through the night from Gujarat to be here, but he was nothing short of overwhelmed at the experience. “To be alive and here for this day is the greatest gift of my life,” said Rajor.Nearby, families sat spread out in a colourful mass across the ground, passing around rotis and chai,and birds swooped over the small fishing boats taking devotees out for a gentle evening river ride. Gayatri Devi Kushwa, 30, said the sacred water was icy cold as she dipped in with her five-year-old son, Deepanshu, “but it felt incredibly peaceful. I never wanted to get out.”View image in fullscreenAn ambulance rushes from the scene of the crowd crushView image in fullscreenManoj Kumar Paswan holds up a picture of his aunt, who he lost in the crushYet within just a few hours, these joyous scenes would turn into a deadly human crush. As darkness fell over the vast makeshift camp on Tuesday evening, more and more devotees poured into the festival site to bathe at thesangamduringMauni Amavasya. People squashed into the square kilometre of land known as the “sangamnose”, trying to reach the riverbank with increasing desperation.View image in fullscreenMounted police attempt to control crowds at a bottleneck at Maha Kumbh MelaView image in fullscreenPolice on guard as pilgrims continue to stream towards the banks of the river, near to where dozens were feared deadBy nightfall, messages were broadcast from loudspeakers telling devotees to only take two dips – “a third dip is a sin” – and then leave the area immediately. Police began to usher families sitting by the river to take their holy bath early and then move on.Many present at the scene said what unfolded next was “inevitable”. It was after 1am, as people poured in from several directions, that chaos and confusion took over and bathers going to the river collided with those returning.

Detritus of the tragedy, including lost shoes and muddied shawls, lay scattered across the sacred banks.Uttar Pradesh police said nearly 18 hours later that the crowd crush had cost the lives of at least 30 devotees and injured at least 60 others. But as dozens of families gathered desperately outside the hospital morgue looking for those lost in the crush, many questioned whether the true death toll was higher.View image in fullscreenPolice cordon off areas in order to try to manage the crowdsThe Kumbh Mela is seen by the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) as a compelling symbol of Hindu unity and power that aligns neatly with their Hindu nationalist political agenda, and the party invested vast resources in putting on and publicising this year’s festival – attracting large numbers of pilgrims. The most visible face at the festival, beaming down every 200 metres from posters and cutouts like that of a high priest, was of prime ministerNarendra Modi.“The Kumbh Mela has become a huge PR exercise for the government,” said Dinesh Giri, a high priest of one of the Hindu monastic sects, known asakharas, who form the spiritual centrepiece of the festival. “Hindus who would never have come before are coming in huge numbers because it’s all over the media and online. Everyone wants to come and take selfies at the Kumbh Mela.”View image in fullscreenA woman who had two family members injured in the crush recounts her story to the media outside the temporary hospitalOn Wednesday, as the state government refused to officially confirm the number of those killed, they were still keenly releasing hourly updates of visitor numbers taking a “royal dip”, which they claimed had hit 76 million by the end of the day.Fears of another crowd crush meant the local train station was closed on Thursday morning. Yet even beneath the cloud of tragedy, the Kumbh Mela festivities continued uninterrupted. The next morning at thesangam, bathers continued to arrive unfazed, though many families stayed tethered together with string. “Nothing could keep me away,” said one 49-year-old pilgrim, Muni Bhai, as he dipped beneath the water.Additional reporting by Aakash HassanExplore more on these topicsKumbh MelaIndiaHinduismSouth and central AsiaReligionNarendra ModinewsShareReuse this content"

Ministers argued that the use of hotels to house asylum seekers was an“incentive”for small boat crossings.Life and death on the Bibby Stockholm: ‘No one wanted to go inside – but we had no choice’Read moreIn July 2023, shortly before the first asylum seekers were due to come onboard, the Guardian highlightedsafety concerns about the barge, including disquiet about narrow corridors, fire safety, crowding two people into bedrooms previously used by one occupant and a lack of lifejackets.Five days after the first 39 men moved in, they had to be removed from the vessel after legionella bacteria, a potentially deadly bacteria,was discovered in the water systemin August 2023.In December 2023,Leonard Farruku, a musician who was seeking asylum after travelling from Albania, is thought to have killed himself on the barge.More than 60 charities and three Labour MPs then demanded the immediate closure of the barge, in aletter published in the Guardian.The signatories write: “For those on board, theBibby Stockholmfeels like a prison. It is cramped, restrictive and segregated. The barge is no place to accommodate people who have fled violence, persecution, and torture, many of whom are traumatised and isolated. They are unable to get the help and specialist support they need. Their mental health has deteriorated and some have felt suicidal.”Within days of getting into power in July last year,the government decided to discontinuethe previous government’s contract to house asylum seekers on the vessel.Extending its use would have cost more than £20m next year, according to the Home Office.In November, when the barge was decommissioned, the total number of people in the UK still waiting for their asylum claims to be processed was estimated to be about 86,000.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Did you see the vehicle – a distinctive gold Land Rover Defender – in the lead-up to the collision?“We believe there were people in the local area who have not been spoken to by police and remain unidentified. I would ask those individuals to please contact us. Our main priority is to ensure the lines of inquiry identified by the review are progressed.“This is a live investigation and in order to maintain its integrity I can’t go into further detail at this stage. I would urge people to avoid speculation.”On Tuesday, the girls’ parents said in a statement: “We welcomed the reopening of the investigation in October 2024 by the Metropolitan police into the death of our beautiful girls and the harm caused to those injured and who witnessed the tragedy on that sunny July day.“It is important that this investigation runs its course unhindered and that each step taken is done so in the pursuit of truth and the full facts. As the investigation continues, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

They warned that the shift in priorities was out of line with the government’s ambition to improve the health of the nation and would prove damaging and even “dangerous” for some groups of patients.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, sought to allay such concerns by ordering the health service to concentrate on delivering shorter waiting times for A&E and cancer care and hospital treatment. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to benefit from faster access and diagnosis. Surveys have shown that long delays for NHS care are the public’s greatest concern.Streeting announced the overhaul when he handed theNHSits mandate and planning guidance – the “success measures” it must focus its energy and resources on – for 2025-26. He has cut the NHS’s list of priorities from 32 for 2024-25 to just 18 for the next financial year.“This new approach will see the NHS focus on what matters most to patients – cutting waiting lists, getting seen promptly at A&E and being able to get a GP appointment,” Streeting said.NHS England chief under fire again as MPs ‘exasperated’ by responsesRead moreBut that did not head off criticism from health groups. Dr Sarah Hughes, the chief executive of the charity Mind, accused ministers of “deprioritising mental health” after an array of schemes to improve care were dropped. They included plans to give 75% of those with severe mental illness an annual physical health checkup, ensure at least 700,000 people a year complete a course of psychological talking therapies, and expand maternal mental health support to at least 66,000 women.Obstetricians and gynaecologists said the abandonment of plans to ensure each of the 42 NHS regions in England has a dedicated women’s health hub by last December was in breach of Labour’s election manifesto commitment to prioritise women’s health. However, 39 of the 42 integrated health boards already have at least one.The 14 dropped targets also include getting 80% of those with high blood pressure on to statins, giving 75% of people with learning disabilities an annual check-up and increasing childhood vaccination rates – which have fallen in recent years – to levels recommended by the World Health Organization.“Reducing the overall number of national NHS targets is not necessarily a bad thing,” said Sarah Woolnough, the chief executive of the King’s Fund thinktank.But, she added: “Setting a relatively large number of goals for hospital care, while losing targets for childhood vaccination and the offering of medicines to people at risk of cardiovascular disease appears to be at odds with ministers’ ambition to prevent illness and not just treat it.”The previous plan to increase the amount of dental activity undertaken by the NHS has been replaced for 2025-26 with a more limited pledge to expand the number of urgent dental appointments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People who cannot afford private care, or who need prevention to avoid worse problems, should come first.”Fiona Carragher, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said she was “shocked” that the target to improve diagnosis of dementia was not in the new guidance.Jon Sparkes, the chief executive of Mencap, said: “Scrapping vital NHS targets for people with a learning disability is a dangerous step backwards.”The new instructions to NHS England will also force it to shed 2,000 jobs as part of a drive to make £325m in savings next year, while the service as a whole has been told to reduce its costs by 1% overall – about £1bn.“In what will undoubtedly be another tough financial year, the NHS will continue its relentless focus on boosting productivity and driving efficiencies for the benefits of patients and taxpayers,” said Amanda Pritchard, NHS England’s chief executive.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthEnglandWes StreetingHealth policyCancerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

This would be a gross miscarriage of justice.“Criminalising men, women and children who have fled conflicts in countries such as Sudan does not disrupt the smuggling gangs’ business model. When a refugee is clambering into a boat with an armed criminal threatening them, they are not thinking about UK laws but are simply trying to stay alive.”The failure to repeal Priti Patel’s Illegal Migration Act means that asylum and human rights claims from countries including Albania, Georgia and India are automatically inadmissible, a spokesperson for Asylum Aid said.Alison Pickup, the organisation’s executive director, said: “Further criminalisation and measures blocking people from protection will do nothing to address the causes of forced displacement and unauthorised movement through Europe to the UK.”Labour hopes the new legislation will help turn the tide against people-smuggling networks that have facilitatedmore than 150,000 small boat arrivals in the UK since 2018. More than 1,000 people have arrived in the UK since the start of this year.It follows a record 78 deaths in the Channel last year, as people smugglers launch flimsy dinghies to sea with up to 120 passengers onboard.The bill will make it an offence to “endanger another life during perilous sea crossing to the UK”. Anyone involved in coercive behaviour, “including preventing offers of rescue”, will face prosecution and an increased sentence of up to five years in prison.This means anyone “rushing” vessels into the sea as they try to launch could also be prosecuted.Home Office sources said some people on small boats had refused to allow the French authorities to board because they wished to enter UK waters and claim asylum.As part of Starmer’spromise to “smash the gangs”, those caught selling or handling small boat parts could also be jailed for up to 14 years as the Home Office will make it “illegal to supply or handle items suspected of being for use by organised crime groups”.Where someone is suspected of selling or handling small boat parts or sharing suspect information online, officials believe the bill will allow them to use these offences to make arrests.In some circumstances, parents could be prosecuted for endangering the lives of their children if the bill becomes law, a human rights assessment of the bill found.“Although it is very unlikely, there is no absolute bar to prosecuting parents who have taken their children on journeys which come within the ambit of the endangerment offence, which could result in the breakup of families,” the assessment said.The Home Office hopes to use the new offences to extradite some of the suppliers and people smugglers responsible for Channel crossings who are caught abroad, as well as to prosecute any who enter the UK.Existing rules mean law enforcement officers are unable to intervene until after a small boat crossing.In an upgrade to serious crime prevention orders, the bill will give law enforcement new powers to impose interim serious crime prevention orders, allowing them to place instant restrictions on organised immigration criminals alongside other serious criminals. This could include bans on travel, internet and mobile phone use, with curbs also leading to social media blackouts, curfews and restricted access to finances.Natasha Tsangarides, the associate director of advocacy at the charity Freedom from Torture, said: “This bill will do nothing to address the root causes of forced displacement. Instead, cracking down on the methods refugees use to escape war and persecution will only make their journeys more dangerous.“We fear that the government’s current approach, directed through the frame of counter-terrorism, risks intensifying the vulnerability of those who are forced to rely on smugglers in the absence of safe routes.“If the government truly wants to address the challenges posed by the movement of refugees across borders, then it would be better directed towards stopping the torture that pushes people from their homes in the first place.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeRefugeesCrimeFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

Further messages were sent that indicated a sexual and sadistic motivation, the police said.DNA tests found traces of Mayhew’s blood in the bedroom and elsewhere in Samson’s flat.It is believed Mayhew was murdered on 8 March, the day she entered Samson’s flat. Two days later, Samson was captured buying a hacksaw, blades and a bucket. Watts was also seen on CCTV buying cleaning products, including bleach and scourers, and a silver incinerator bin.“Having committed the murder they then made very extensive efforts to pervert the course of justice over a number of days,” Little told the court. He added that the murder had been planned and premeditated.Nearly a month after Mayhew died, her remains were discovered in Rowdown Fields in New Addington by a dog walker. Other body parts were found in the River Wandle in Mitcham.Mayhew had two children, aged 12 and 15 when she was killed, and had “the rest of her life ahead of her”, said DCI Martin Thorpe, from the Specialist Crime Command.In a victim impact statement, Mayhew’s mother, Angela, said of her daughter: “It breaks my heart she is not around.”Her father, David, thanked the defendants forpleading guiltyand saving his family from the ordeal of sitting through a trial. He added: “That said, whatever sentence you may receive will never compare to the pain you have caused us.“I ask myself the same question all the time: why did you have to kill her? Maybe I will never know.”Explore more on these topicsLondonCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Businessesinside the USandacross the worldhave warned of widespread disruption if the Trump administration pushes ahead.Trump repeatedly pledged on the campaign trail to use tariffs to revive the US economy, disregardingmany economists’ concernsthat imposing higher duties on goods from overseas would exacerbate inflation, rather than rapidly bring down prices, as the president has promised.‘We just can’t take the hit’: businesses worldwide brace as Trump threatens tariffsRead moreWhile the Trump campaign mooted a universal tariff on all foreign goods, the Trump administration has so far opted to target specific US trading partners. The president has made clear that China and the European Union are in his sights, but has so far focused on America’s closest neighbors.Weeks after his election victory last November, Trump announced on his own social network that upon his return to office he would “sign all necessary documents” to impose a 25% tariff onMexicoand Canada. Mexico must stop “illegal aliens” from crossing its border with the US, he said, and Canada must halt the flow of drugs like fentanyl. “Until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!”Trump did not, in fact, sign these documents following his inauguration. Instead, he introduced a deadline – 1 February – by which both countries are supposed to resolve his concerns.Asked about the deadline on Thursday, he said: “We may or may not. We’re going to make that determination probably tonight.”Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president, has alreadytaken Trump throughthe various migration initiatives her government has undertaken. Experts haveraised questionsover Trump’s demand from Canada, with so little fentanyl entering the US through its northern border that the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) omitted to even mention Canadain a 2020 report.Unswayed by such details, in recent weeks Trump has claimed his administration will raise “hundreds of billions of dollars, and even trillions of dollars” through tariffs that would boost the US economy. He has spoken ofestablishing an “external revenue service”to collect the money.While he and his allies continue to talk up tariffs as a viable financial revenue stream for the US, Trump – who as both politician and reality TV star has spoken highly of his dealmaking prowess – has previously raised them as a negotiating tactic, only to withdraw the threat.This strategy played out less than a week after his inauguration, when the White House threatened Colombia with tariffs and sanctions as punishment for its refusal to accept military flights carrying deportees.Colombia later agreed, and the threat was withdrawn.InCanada, ministers have expressed optimism that a resolution by Saturday remains possible. “I remain hopeful we’re going to be able to solve this. We’ve been doing it for 150 years together,” David McGuinty, the public safety minister, told reporters. “I don’t see why we can’t do it now.”Since Trump’s initial social media post about the Canadian border, officials in Ottawa have pledged to spend C$1.3bn for new measures, including the use of two Black Hawk helicopters and 60 drones.But it stands ready to hit back. A first round of retaliatory tariffs would cause minimal damage to the US, covering C$37bn of its exports to Canada, and if needed, Canada’s federal government plans to escalate by imposing tariffs on C$110bn worth of goods.Trump’s tariff plan will send prices ‘through the roof’, warn US firmsRead more“The reality is that a large, uncontrolled bully is using his position as the most powerful political leader in the world, to put pressure on a whole range of allies,” said Lawrence Herman, an international trade lawyer and senior fellow at the CD Howe Institute. “We have to, in Canada and the rest of the world, recognize that we’ve entered a new era.“With the Trump administration, there are no rules. There is no respect for international treaties or agreements. There is no longer value to the US signature on international documents.”In Mexico, meanwhile, the government has sent signals it is prepared to do more on migration and fentanyl trafficking – evennotching up a record seizure soon after Trump’s threats began– but it has also sought to play down the prospects of a trade war.“We don’t think [the tariffs] will happen. And if they do, we have our plan,” Sheinbaum said on Wednesday.“People are worried here, and there is a sense of uncertainty – which is what Donald Trump seeks to create,” said Kenneth Smith Ramos, Mexico’s former chief negotiator during talks over the USMCA free trade deal, struck between the US, Mexico and Canada during the first Trump administration.“It’s a bit like a game of chicken: the two cars are hurtling towards each other at top speed,” he said. “Mexico has to send the signal that its car is not a little one but a big one that could also hurt the United States.”Exports account for roughly 40% of Mexico’s gross domestic product (GDP), and more than 80% of them go to the US. While the country would try to diversify its export markets in the event of an economic dispute with the US, “you’re never going to be able to replace the US market with any other country”, said Smith Ramos.Ministers have stressed that “cool heads” are required in the face of Trump’s public threats and declined to disclose their plan of action if tariffs are imposed. “But you can be sure we have studied it a great deal,” Marcelo Ebrard, the Mexican economic secretary, said recently. “There will be no surprises, nor untimely reactions.”Have a question about tariffs?

It’s frustrating that the NIH management is still acting like we are not a union, that we do not have rights. But, you know, if anything it has hardened our resolve to fight for every fellow at the NIH.”The National Institutes of Health did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the demand to bargain over changes implemented by the new administration.The acting director of the NIH, Dr Matthew Memoli, hasreportedlyattempted to clarify this week that clinical trials at the institute and those its funds, and critical hiring and purchases, can continue. But many questions remain over how current and future research will be affected by Trump’s actions.The NIH union only secured acontractin December, about a year after the Federal Labor Relations Authority granted its approval to form. Its electionwinin 2023 amounted to the largest new union of federal employees toformin a decade, and the first at the NIH.“We were anticipating changes, and that it would be a new relationship we would have to manage but I don’t think anyone expected this firehose,” said Alexander Jordan Lara, a postbaccalaureate fellow at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research and a member of the union’s bargaining committee. “The fact that these are just unilaterally implemented is a violation of our agreement.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even short delays in grant funding and delays in people’s careers, impeding their careers, will have shortfalls and really harm the research, and that’s harming the American people.”The UAW Region 8 director, Tim Smith, said in a statement: “These freezes are already causing research at the NIH to grind to a halt.“UAW calls on the Trump administration, including acting health and human services secretary Dr Dorothy Fink and Congress, to either bargain with us immediately or to lift these draconian restrictions immediately to ensure that scientific research in the United States, including the crucial work done by UAW members, can continue without interruption.”Explore more on these topicsUS unionsDonald TrumpUS healthcarenewsShareReuse this content"

Microsoft, currently OpenAI’s biggest shareholder, also joined that roundLast weekOpenAIand SoftBank teamed up with Oracle to form Stargate, which Donald Trump called “the largest AI infrastructure project in history”. The partnership aims to build datacentres for AI systems, with an initial spend of $100bn.Citing multiple sources with knowledge of the talks,the FT saidSoftBank’s equity investment would cover the Japanese company’s commitment to Stargate. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and an influential figure in the Trump administration, has claimed Stargate’s backers “don’t actually have the money”.OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, replied on Musk’s social media platform, X, that the funding claims were wrong: “This is great for the country. I realize what is great for the country isn’t always what’s optimal for your companies, but in your new role I hope you’ll mostly put US first.”OpenAI received a competitive jolt this month fromthe emergence of the Chinese rival DeepSeek, after its latest chatbot went to the top of the Apple free app store and sent AI-linked stocks plunging on Monday.Although Altman initially said that he was impressed with DeepSeek and that it was “legitimately invigorating to have a new competitor”, the company later said it had evidence that Chinese startups were “constantly”using OpenAI’s technology to develop competing products.The OpenAI equity investment proposal, led by the SoftBank chief executive, Masayoshi Son, has been vetted by senior executives and the board at OpenAI, the FT reported.

The suit originated in 2021 when Trump sued the social media company for suspending his accounts after theJanuary 6 attackon the US Capitol. The settlement wasfirst reported by the Wall Street Journaland has been confirmed by a Meta spokesperson.The majority of the settlement, $22m, will go toward a fund to pay for Trump’s presidential library, according to the Wall Street Journal. The remainder will pay for legal fees and go to other plaintiffs listed in the case. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump’s lawsuit against Facebook, which is now under parent companyMeta, was one of several he brought against social media companies in the wake of January 6. He also sued YouTube, Twitter (now X) and those companies’ executives. A federal judge dismissed the suit against Twitter. The Google suit was closed in 2023, but has the option to be reopened.Groups helping Americans find abortion pills report Instagram ‘shadow-banning’Read moreShortly after the insurrection at the Capitol, Facebook suspended Trump’s accounts. At the time, the president was using the platform to spread false claims around election fraud and to repeatedly say he won the 2020 election.Facebook broke with its hands-off approach for political leaders and updated its rules to allow for suspensions of lawmakers to be used in “exceptional cases” during periods of civil unrest and violence.Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO, said the company came to the decision because, “we believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great”.The company gave Trump the maximum penalty under those rules, suspending his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely.“They shouldn’t be allowed to get away with this censoring and silencing, and ultimately, we will win. Our Country can’t take this abuse anymore!” Trump said at the time. He later said, “Next time I’m in the White House there will be no more dinners, at his request, with Mark Zuckerberg and his wife. It will be all business!”A few months later, Facebookdowngraded the suspensionto two years. And, at the two-year mark in 2023, the companyreinstated Trump’s accessto the platform. Twitter and YouTube also allowed Trump back onto their platforms.Zuckerberg has now made it onto Trump’s good side. He met with the president several times over the last couple of months and sat front row at the inauguration.

The president reportedly said the lawsuit had to be dealt with before Zuckerberg could be “brought into the tent”. The Journal reported that Zuckerberg returned to Mar-a-Lago in early January for a day-long mediation.Shortly after that trip to Florida, Zuckerberg made a dramatic public announcement saying Meta waslifting restrictions on its platformand allowing for more political content.

Musk added that Tesla’srobotaxibusiness would start in June this year, though what shape it will take is unclear.

Tesla regained the top spot for the first three quarters of 2024, thanks in part to steep price cuts.In its earnings report on Wednesday, Tesla reported 495,570 deliveries for the fourth quarter and 1.8m for the full year. This is the company’s first annual decline, which follows a year of repeatedly failing to meet quarterly delivery targets in 2024.European subsidies for electric cars have declined, hurting Tesla in that market, where October registrations of Tesla vehicles fell by 24%. Some Wall Street analysts expect demand for Teslas to increase after the US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates.Tesla’s disappointing delivery numbers point to its offerings failing to woo new customers last year. The trapezoidal, Hot Wheels-esqueCybertruck, released in November 2023 after lengthy delays and priced at roughly $80,000, has produced sales numbers that have not compensated for the decline in demand for Tesla’s older models.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The accusations include claims that Tucker exposed his genitals, brushed some of the therapists with his penis and left ejaculate on treatment tables. Two spas told the Banner they had banned Tucker from returning. One therapist who spoke to the Banner described Tucker’s alleged behavior as “really degrading”. Another said that “I can’t watch sports anymore. I see his face everywhere.”The alleged incidents are said to have taken place between 2012 and 2016.In a lengthy statement posted to X on Thursday, Tucker described the allegations as “unequivocally false” and said the Banner was guilty of “journalistic failures at every turn”.Tucker’s attorneys also denied the claims. “Mr Tucker has never behaved inappropriately during any massage therapy session, and certainly never in the manner described … Any suggestion to the contrary is a fictitious and utterly baseless claim,” attorneys Thomas A Clare and Steven J Harrison told the Banner.TheNFLsaid in a statement that it “first became aware of the allegations from the reporter investigating this story as they were not previously shared with the NFL. We take any allegation seriously and will look into the matter.”The women told the Banner that they had not reported the allegations to the police.Tucker is considered by many to be the greatest kicker in NFL history, and holds the records for longest field-goal and career field-goal percentage. He has been named to the Pro Bowl seven times since he joined the Ravens as an undrafted free agent in 2012. The 35-year-old is one of the few kickers to become a well-known name in the US, and is also known as an amateur opera singer.The allegations are similar to those faced by quarterback Deshaun Watson. In 2022, the NFL suspended Watson for 11 games after more than 24 women accused him of sexual assault and inappropriate conduct that occurred while he was getting massages. Criminal chargeswere never broughtagainst Watson, but he reached settlements in 23 of the 24 civil lawsuits that he was facing.Explore more on these topicsBaltimore RavensNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Again, United’s powderpuff backline failed: the delivery was a diagonal Noussair Mazraoui, De Ligt and Lisandro Martínez all missed yet Mihai Popescu’s sliding volley did the same.For FCSB it was a glimpse that a famous win was possible. As they should, United retained a dash of potency, as when Højlund ran wide to turn back Martínez’s pass in behind. The striker found Mainoo but he blasted over from point-blank range.The 1,500 or so United enthusiasts who had made the trip could be happy, though, as those in white spun the ball about at a pace pleasing to Amorim. Eriksen warmed Stefan Tarnovanu’s fingers with a fierce shot, and when Steaua had possession United pressed quickly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The two Premier League clubs will be placed ondifferent sides of the bracketin Friday's draw, and will both play winners of the playoffs betweenAZorMidtjyllandandReal SociedadorGalatasaray.Rangers' final-day climb into the top eight means they skip the playoffs, but they could face the teams they pipped to eighth place –Bodø/GlimtorAnderlecht– while their potential playoff opponents,TwenteandFenerbahce, also look dangerous after just avoiding elimination.If Rangers advance to the quarter-finals, they are likely to face eitherLazioorAthletic Bilbao, although the group-topping Serie A side could play arch-rivalsRomain the last 16. Manchester United and Tottenham will be in a quarter withEintracht FrankfurtorLyon, depending on the draw's outcome.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But Højlund’s toothlessness was evident when a free header, near-in, from Martínez’s flighted ball did not trouble the keeper. This, or one of Mainoo’s two chances, had to be taken as United are no goal machine, and as this opening 45 minus aged, those in blue edged back as a force, pinning their visitors near their area.United’s shot count was six to Steaua’s paltry two. Their possession percentage was 69. At the interval they were in the fourth place they began the night, Rangers, two points back, the closest to stymieing the bid to avoid a playoff. To shake things up Amorim’s options were to stick or make a change – Amad Diallo’s zest and Garnacho’s directness his best options for this, being his only attackers on the bench.This was precisely what the Portuguese plumped for. Off went Malacia and Collyer, and on came the Ivorian and Argentinian. Garnacho’s first touch was to clip Tarnovanu’s left post after he latched on to a poor back pass: the speedster raced forward but, in a microcosm of a chief United ill, his radar was awry.Eriksen seemed to favour De Ligt as the far more likely to net than an actual forward. You could hardly blame him. At a second free-kick one of the two Amorim No 10s pinged the ball over from the left, it bounced on to the Dutchman, but he mirrored Mainoo, Garnacho, Eriksen and Højlund in his pale imitation of a lethal marksman.Next, Højlund offered a latest, unwanted iteration of the act when passed to inside the Steaua area: he worked the ball sharply on to his favoured left but when he shot Tarnovanu had a simple gather. Yet soon the home keeper saw Fernandes smack an attempt off the frame and when his defence half-cleared, Mainoo directed a cross from the right and Dalot slid in. It came in front of the now jubilant travelling fans, so the wing-back milked his moment.After Mainoo’s clincher United did what they struggle to do: manage the remainder of the tie professionally. Bayindir’s late save from an Alexandru Baluta rocket ensured that.PosTeamPGDPts1Lazio812192Athletic Bilbao88193Man Utd87184Tottenham Hotspur88175Eintracht Frankfurt84166Lyon88157Olympiacos86158Rangers86149Bodo/Glimt831410Anderlecht821411FCSB811412Ajax881313Real Sociedad841314Galatasaray831315Roma841216Plzen811217Ferencvaros801218FC Porto821119AZ801120Midtjylland801121Union Saint Gilloise801122PAOK821023Twente8-11024Fenerbahce8-21025Braga8-31026IF Elfsborg8-51027Hoffenheim8-3928Besiktas8-5929Maccabi Tel-Aviv8-9630Slavia Prague8-4531Malmo FF8-7532Rigas FS8-7533Ludogorets8-7434Dynamo Kiev8-13435Nice8-9336Qarabag FK8-143Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueSteaua BucharestManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Skating Club of Boston said six of its members had been on the plane, which had been bringing them back from a development camp that followed the US national figure skating championships in Wichita, Kansas.It named the skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane, both aged 16, along with Han’s mother, Jin Han, and Lane’s mother, Molly Lane. A story on Lane’s Instagram account, posted on Wednesday evening, showed the view from an aeroplane window captioned by the airport codes ICT and DCA, corresponding to the journey in question. The club also said the Russian-born ice skating coaches and former world champions Yevgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who were husband and wife, were among its members who had taken the flight.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Doug Zeghibe, the chief executive of the Skating Club where Shishkova and Naumov had been longtime coaches, said the organisation was “completely devastated and at a loss for words”. He added: “Skating is a very close and tight-knit community. These kids and their parents, they’re here at our facility in Norwood, six, sometimes seven days a week. It’s a close, tight bond. This will have long-reaching impacts for our skating community.”Zeghibe stated separately that he believed 14 members of the skating community, including those from his club, had been lost in the crash. The Russian news outlet Mash published a list of 13 skaters, many of them the children of Russian émigrés to the United States, who it said were believed to have been on the plane.Shishkova and Naumov, who were married to each other, won the world championships in pairs figure skating in 1994, also competing at two Winter Olympics. Reports suggested their son Maxim, also a skater and the US junior men’s champion in 2020, had been competing in Wichita but departed earlier in the week and was not on Flight 5342.View image in fullscreenEvgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov perform at the 1995 world figure skating championships in Birmingham.Photograph: Chris Cole/Getty ImagesThe Russian news agency Tass reported that Inna Volyanskaya, a former skater who competed for the Soviet Union and was a coach at the Washington figure skating club, was also onboard.A statement from Volyanskaya’s club, published on Instagram, read: “We are devastated to hear the news of American Eagle flight 5342. Our thoughts and prayers are with our skating family during this difficult time. More information will be posted when appropriate.”US Figure Skating, the country’s governing body for the sport, said in a statement: “We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims’ families closely in our hearts.”Tributes were quickly paid across the sporting world as news of the crash emerged. The International Skating Union said that the global skating community was “deeply shocked by the tragic accident”.“We are heartbroken to learn that figure skaters, along with their families, friends, and coaches, are understood to be among those on board,” it said. “Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this tragedy.Figure skatingis more than a sport – it’s a close-knit family – and we stand together.”ISU president Jae Youl Kim expressed his condolences in a statement, saying: “Today, the world of figure skating is heartbroken. We share our deepest, most sincere condolences with the families and friends of all those who lost their lives in this terrible crash. To lose so many members of our community in this way brings sadness beyond words.”Later Thursday, amoment of silence was observedprior to the evening session at the European figure skating championships in Tallinn, Estonia.Others from the US skating system to voice their grief included the Skating Club of Phoenix, which wrote on Instagram that it was “devastated by the tragic news of Flight 5342”. The post continued: “This is a huge loss to the figure skating world. Our hearts are broken.”View image in fullscreenEmergency response units conduct a search and rescue operation at the crash site on the Potomac river on Thursday.Photograph: Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesSeveral senior International Olympic Committee members, who were gathered in Lausanne for the hustings to choose the next IOC president, also expressed their condolences. Sebastian Coe, the World Athletics president, told reporters: “It would be remiss of me if I didn’t reflect on the awful events last night in the United States. I know there was grievous loss of life across the range, but I’m also deeply conscious there were Olympians and the families of Olympians on that desperate fight. So on behalf of the whole of World Athletics I’d say that our thoughts and prayers with all those families and friends have suffered such a grievous loss.”Another candidate for IOC president, Juan Samaranch Jnr, added: “The loss of life, of athletes and non-athletes, in the Olympic family and not in the Olympic family, puts everything into perspective. They have my sympathies and we hope for the best.”In a statement, the Kremlin indicated that Shishkova and Naumov as well as several other Russians had been on board. “There were other of our fellow citizens on board. It’s bad news today from Washington. We are sorry and send our condolences to families and friends,” the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.The American figure skater Luke Wang also wrote on social media that several skaters were on board the plane. “We pray for everyone who was on the flight from Wichita to DC.

Neither answer is wrong. I edge towards Allen here, for the sole reason that he hasn’t won the award before. That’s not right; it’s not fair. But it’s the only way to split the fine margins between the two.Jackson has the stronger statistical case. Allen’s is based on numbers and vibes. He sanded the rough edges off his game this year, allowing the Bills to lean into their powerful run game before hedonned his cape in crucial moments.Then and now: how do the Eagles and Chiefs compare to 2023’s Super Bowl?Read moreIn a pass-heavy offense, Allen’s numbers may have been even more eye-popping. But by embracing a new style, Allen was able to pilot the most efficient, effective offense of his career.Most electric player of the seasonSaquon Barkley, RB, Philadelphia Eagles.Thank you, football gods, for delivering us a healthy Barkley season behind the best run-blocking line in the league. Every Barkley carry this season has been an adventure. You don’t know what’s coming; you just prepare to be amazed. It could be leaping backward over a defender, making a would-be tackler tumble out of his cleats, or slithering through the smallest of gaps before darting away for a 50-yard score. Even without the ball, Barkley has been must-see TV, flattening pass-rushers in protection. Butit’s his home-run threatthat has sparkled this year. Barkley has 11 rushing touchdowns of 60-plus yards in the regular season and postseason, putting him second all-time behind Adrian Peterson. Not even Jim Brown ripped off chunk plays at this clip.After the era ofRunning Backs Don’t Matter, Barkley has proven that handing the ball to the most explosive athlete on the field is still the most thrilling sight in the sport.View image in fullscreenZack Baun has improved an already formidable Eagles defense.Photograph: Derik Hamilton/APDefensive player of the yearZack Baun, LB,Philadelphia Eagles.Typically, this honor goes to a pass-rusher with the highest sack total or a defensive back who has notched double-digit interceptions. But it’s time to reward someone for their overall defensive impact.No defender has made a greater difference to a unit than Baun. He may not be thebestplayer on the Eagles’ all-world defense, but he is the most important.Philly’s do-everything linebacker allows the Eagles tofudge matchupsin a way no one else at his position can replicate, elevating the defense against the run, in pass coverage and rushing the passer. The Eagles overhauled their defense midseason because of Baun’s versatility along the line of scrimmage and his gift for sinking into coverage, unlocking their talent up front, and freeing up their rookies in the secondary to play fast and physically. If you want to go by the figures, Baun’s stand up with anyone’s. He led the league in run stops and tackles for a loss in the regular season, forced two fumbles and grabbed two interceptions. Not bad for a former special teams ace the Eagles took a $1m flier on last offseason.Rookies of the yearOffensive: Jayden Daniels, QB, Washington CommandersDefensive: Jared Verse, Edge, Los Angeles RamsOutside Magic Johnson, no rookie, in any US sport, has had as profound an impact on a franchise as Jayden Daniels on the Commanders. He ended the franchise’s playoff drought and transformed the entire tenor of the long-moribund franchise. The Commanders are fun! You can root for the Commies again!Dan Snyder is sad! If a redraft was held today, Daniels would go No 1 overall.Defensively, Rams edge-rusher Jared Verse runs away with it. Verse became one of the most dominant pass-rushers in the league, on a team screaming out for some oomph up front. Verse finished the season first in total pressures, sixth in pressure rate and eighth in pass-rush win rate among all pass-rushers this season. In the past 15 years, only Micah Parsons and Myles Garrett have cracked the top eight in all three categories as rookies.NFL Films clip of the yearAre you ready to run through a brick wall? No?

Maybe he will save his finest trickeration in Chicago for when it matters most.View image in fullscreenDan Quinn helped turn around the fortunes of the Washington Commanders.Photograph: Jorge Lemus/NurPhoto/REX/ShutterstockCoach of the yearDan Quinn, Washington Commanders.Kevin O’Connell, Sean Payton, Andy Reid and Campbell would all be worthy choices. But Quinn should be the pick. Remember, Quinn was not evenWashington’sfirst choice when they hired him as head coach last offseason. They had their eyes set on Johnson in Detroit before pivoting to the former Cowboys defensive coordinator.A year on, Quinn led the franchise to within a game of the Super Bowl. The bulk of the credit for the team’s postseason run goes (fairly) to Daniels, but it was Quinn who signed off on drafting the rookie and chose to pair his new quarterback with Kliff Kingsbury, the team’s offensive play-caller. Quinn has also undergone a Sean McDermott-esque makeover, converting from a defense-first, conservative head coach in Atlanta into a born-again, ultra-aggressive head coach in Washington.Quinn’s penchant for going for it on fourth down allowed the Commanders to dictate the flow of games. He recognized his rookie QB was special – and that his defense was so-so – and opted to put the ball in the hand of his best player to decide close games. Without Quinn’s in-game management and his schemed-up, feisty pass-rush the Commanders would not have won 12 regular-season games or enjoyed their playoff run.Assistant coach of the yearVance Joseph, defensive coordinator, Denver Broncos.It’s a loaded slate of assistant coaches this season. Brian Flores’ confuse-and-clobber defense was key to the Vikings’ 14-win season. Joe Brady helped reorient the Bills offense around their rushing attack, allowing Allen to have the strongest season of his career. Vic Fangio turned the Eagles’ defense from a laughingstock into the most fearsome unit in the league. But the underrated Joseph deserves his flowers.Quick test: name five starters on the Broncos’ defense. After Patrick Surtain II, who do you have? Nik Bonitto? Zach Allen? What about the starting linebackers?Joseph built a nasty, creative, deep defense out of mostly castoffs and afterthoughts. Alex Singleton and Justin Strnad, journeymen linebackers, flashed as stars in Joseph’s set-up. Safeties PJ Locke and Brandon Jones were as impactful as any safety tandem outside Detroit. Thanks to a wonky, blitz-happy scheme and the individual brilliance of Allen, Surtain and Bonitto, Denver finished the season first in quarterback pressure rate, sack percentage and defensive touchdowns.Joseph’s attack-minded group finished the season first in the league in EPA/play, the best single measure of a unit’s down-to-down effectiveness. Joseph turned unheralded players into legitimate stars. Few coaches are better at mixing and matching their plan against specific opponents, or slotting players into specific roles that help the scheme sing.Surreal moment of the yearLet’s go to Week 8 and the Hail Mary that changedeverything.Jayden Daniels hitting a 52-yard buzzer beaterto Noah Brown still sits as one of the sliding doors moments of the season. The Bears were up 15-12 before the last-second Daniels-to-Brown connection. They had won three games in a row leading up to the trip to Washington, while the Commanders were still just fun upstarts. What if the ball was batted down or didn’t fall to Brown? Would thelegend of Daniels In The Clutchhave been born? Would the Bears, now riding a four-game winning streak, have limped to an extra win or two? What would that have meant for head coach Matt Eberflus, who Chicago fired before the end of the regular season? Would Johnson still be in Detroit, or would he now be the head coach of the Raiders or Jaguars.It was such a manifestly amazing/stupid/perfect ending. Ultimately, it wound up encapsulating both teams. The Bears flubbed their lines in a big moment, as they often did under Eberflus. Jayden Daniels was the calmest person in the building, finding any way to win a tight game.Quote of the year“It’s not like we have the first pick in the draft. We’re at No 10, as I recall right now. What are we? No 9? Excuse me, it was No 10 before,”– New Orleans Saints general manager Mickey Loomis.Blink and you may have missed this one. But that’s the Saints general manager in his end-of-year, what-went-wrong press conference forgetting where his 5-12 team will pick in the upcoming draft.The Saints may have the bleakest medium-term outlook in the league, which is why coaching candidates have run for the hills when Loomis has come calling. Loomis hasdriven the Saints into salary cap hell. He’s bungled head coach searches. His draft record since 2017 has been abysmal. That’s left the team’s roster looking old, injury-riddled and lacking talent. Despite his mismanagement, Loomis has clung to power in New Orleans and is now tasked with picking a new head coach and overseeing a rebuild.Asked why a coach would want the Saints job given the circumstances, Loomis responded: “There’s 32 teams and we’re one of them.” Apparently, that is notactuallyenough. One coach turned down the job and two others withdrew their names from consideration, in part because they would be working for Loomis and his brand ofcap shenanigans. Yikes.Unless Loomis can cobble together a stellar draft class this offseason, the Saints will be staring down years in the wilderness. Here’s hoping the team’s general manager figures out where they’re picking.Explore more on these topicsNFLBuffalo BillsPhiladelphia EaglesWashington CommandersLos Angeles RamsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A long road lies ahead, and Guardiola, with fresh scratches on his head, lamented what he has lost: “What I wish from the beginning of the season is to have the team back and players fit.”LilleIn the early weeks of the group stages, France’s lesser light shone while Paris Saint-Germain faltered. All four eventually made the top 24, PSG climbing above Monaco and Brest, leaving the northerners as France’s sole members of the top eight. On Wednesday, Bruno Génésio’s team were brilliant as they destroyed Feyenoord, who had hammered Bayern Munich last time out, with Angel Gomes showing off some outrageous skills. Jonathan David, soon to be a free agent, did his marketability a few favours with another goal. Lille were previously known as a club that spruced up talent but now they are a dangerous opponent.InterWhen it comes to unfussy campaigns, completed with little drama, Inter’s sets a template for the 36-team Swiss system. An opening stalemate with Man City, one defeat to Bayer Leverkusen and just a single goal conceded. Inter also scored the fewest goals (11) among the top eight. Five of those goals came from Lautaro Martínez, beloved in Milan but misunderstood elsewhere. His hat-trick did for a dangerous Monaco in Wednesday’s 3-0 win.Heading downDinamo ZagrebOne of Uefa’s ideas behind the competition’s revamp was to hand smaller teams a chance to duke it out with the elite. The bottom tranche of the final table, the eliminated 12 teams, aside from the Red Bull clubs’ collective nightmare, served as an indicator of continuing economic inequalities. It was Dinamo who went closest to breaching the velvet rope, finishingoutside the top-24 only on goal difference. On a dark night in Croatia’s capital, Milan were beaten but other results went against the team coached by Fabio Cannavaro. Christian Pulisic becoming the first USMNT player to score four goals in a single Champions League season was rather forgotten in the light of fellow American Yunus Musah’s silly pair of yellow cards.StuttgartGerman football has taken a beating in this season’sChampions League, with RB Leipzig’s implosion. Stuttgart also were left two places out of the top 24 after they were taken apart 4-1 at home by PSG. If there are signs of the Parisians finally evolving into a footballing concern rather than haute-couture item, then Stuttgart, who had enjoyed being back at the top table, fell sadly short. This was previewed as the match where the teams would game the system, settling for the draw that would guide them both through. Nobody told any of that to Ousmane Dembélé, scorer of a hat-trick. “Today we saw what the world’s best is like,” said Stuttgart coach Sebastian Hoeness. He may have exaggerated slightly: PSG had, in fact, finished 15th.JuventusDissatisfaction continues to envelop the latest attempt to revive Italy’s most dominant force. Juve are in the playoffs but their coach, Thiago Motta, is running short of excuses. His team are way out of the Serie A title chase and were well beaten by Benfica at home on Wednesday. A patched-up defence including Tim Weah at right-back and Weston McKennie were too often bystanders against the speed of Benfica’s attack. Juve may already have had a place booked in the knockouts but to lose so meekly after the weekend’s loss to Napoli was untimely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The kid from El Paso has scored at least once in all eight of his starts for PSV this season andhis close-range flick from Mauro Júnior’s crosswas so deft that the TV commentators were unsure if he had touched it at all. Pepi had given a lively display against an admittedly second-choice Liverpool defence. “No matter what team they have, the first or second team, we know that they have quality players,” said Pepi. Such is the rumour mill at this time of year that he has now been linked with Liverpool themselves.Morgan Rogers (Aston Villa)Becoming, after Wayne Rooney against Fenerbahçe in 2004, the second-youngest English scorer of a Champions League hat-trick, was the latest signpost for one of the breakthrough talents in this season’s Premier League. Rogers was one of the many young players Manchester City let slip from their grasp but he has fought back via loans and outstanding showings for Middlesbrough last season. On a day when Villarebuffed Arsenal’s move for Ollie Watkinsbut decided thatJhon Durán was expendable, Rogers reminded us the club has other attacking talent.Ethan Nwaneri (Arsenal)Talking of the flowering of English youth, Arsenal’s 17-year-old became the second-youngest English player to score in the Champions League. Jude Bellingham, when at Borussia Dortmund, retains the record. Playing on the opposite wing to Raheem Sterling, Nwaneri more than matched the performance of a player who not long ago was a prodigy himself. Nwaneri had three shots on goal and nine crosses, and capped it with a superb strike,smashing the ball home with his left foot. “He’s willing to take the initiative to make things happen,” said a delighted Mikel Arteta.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueManchester CityLilleInternazionaleStuttgartJuventusDinamo ZagrebfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Will it happen or not? That’s up to the clubs to decide and to see what negotiations go on.”Salah said on 3 January that his representatives andLiverpoolwere “far away from any progress” on a new deal.Saudi Arabia was last monthawarded the right to host the 2034 men’s World Cup. Asked about the scheduling of the tournament, Prince Abdulaziz said: “That’s a debate that we’re still having with Fifa, and I’m sure that the ultimate goal would be: ‘What would be the best experience for the fans to come and attend?’”He pointed to the “success” of Qatar in staging a winter World Cup in November and December 2022, which required many European leagues to take a mid-season break. “Everyone went on with their business, and it didn’t affect anyone in a big way,” he said. “Some actually claimed that the matches were actually better at that time, because it was in the beginning of the season, and the athletes were at their peak performance instead of at the end of the season.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After the introspection brought on by a dismal run of form, it was at least heartwarming for Tottenham to seal their place in the last 16 of theEuropa Leaguethanks to three academy products puncturing the tension during a blistering end to an otherwise forgettable game.This was not a night to rage at Daniel Levy, the beleaguered Spurs chairman. This was a night that belonged to Dane Scarlett, who did not look like a saviour when he came on with the score locked at 0-0 on 66 minutes. Inspiration was running low at that stage. Radu Dragusin had just added to the injury problems after jarring his knee and the underdogs ofElfsborgwere beginning to think that there might be a goal in it for them.Raskin and Cerny edge Rangers past Union Saint-Gilloise to reach knockoutsRead moreBut Scarlett wanted it when he replaced Dragusin. Recalled this month from a disappointing loan spell at Oxford United, the 20-year-old striker immediately threw himself into the thick of the action. This was Scarlett’s chance. It has been almost five years since he made his debut for Spurs and he was desperate to impress. The desire was clear when Dejan Kulusevski crossed in the 70th minute and Scarlett, who cannot go back out on loan now that he has played for two clubs in one season, held off a challenge before making it 1-0 with a fine header.Ange Postecoglou’s faith in youth had been rewarded, and there was more to come. There was more joy when the 19-year-old winger Oyindamola Ajayi came on to score on his debut. Then came added time and a big moment for the gifted 17-year-old winger Mikey Moore, whose first goal for the club broke Jimmy Greaves’s 67-year-old record as the youngest English scorer in a major European competition.“Made in Tottenham,” Postecoglou said. “They’ll go to sleep pretty excited. I keep saying that it’s been a pretty tough period in terms of our league form but there has still been real growth. It will all come to fruition. I’m so certain and bullish about that.”View image in fullscreenDamola Ajayi (right) scored on his debut to give Tottenham a 2-0 lead.Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty ImagesSpurs are 15th in the Premier League but victory here was enough to earn them fourth spot in the Europa League group phase. Postecoglou, who was tightlipped on Spurs’ pursuit of the Bayern Munich forward Mathys Tel, has some respite. He needed his weary team to avoid the drain of falling into the playoff round. He hopes that more players will return from injury in time for the knockout phase, where Tottenham will face one of AZ Alkmaar, Midtjylland, Real Sociedad or Galatasaray. “It’s been a pretty good European campaign,” Postecoglou said. “We’ve had to deal with some adversity.”Will it be the making of Spurs? There has been no let-up in recent months. They must have marvelled at this being Elfsborg’s fourth competitive fixture since the end of the Swedish season on 10 November. Imagine the luxury of such a long break. Spurs have had to play through the pain barrier and while they were boosted by the return of Micky van de Ven, who came straight back into central defence after more than a month out, there was a danger that confidence would be on the floor after Sunday’s defeat by Leicester.Quick GuideRoundup: Lazio hold on to top spot, Besiktas crash outShowLaziofinished top of the Europa League's opening league phase despite a 1-0 defeat atBraga.

There was backing for the team and Van de Ven was greeted as a returning hero, but the first chants of “Levy Out” soon echoed around the ground. The first half was tough. Elfsborg sat back and stifled Spurs. The only rays of hope came from Son, who created chances for Pape Matar Sarr and Moore. Isak Pettersson denied them with superb saves.The intensity dipped and Postecoglou made a triple change during the interval. Van de Ven was replaced by Dragusin after easing himself back into action, Rodrigo Bentancur came off for Yves Bissouma in midfield and Son made way for Kulusevski, but Spurs were flat.

Scarlett joined Richarlison in attack, Sarr went to left-back, Ben Davies moved next to Archie Gray in central defence and the mood changed.

The Swede’s deep, inswinging cross was a beauty and Scarlett stooped to head in from close range.Scarlett looked sharp. He was involved again after 84 minutes, finding Ajayi, who dribbled inside and fired in from 18 yards. Nobody was thinking about Levy now.

Their deal for Walsh will also be widely seen as a further boost to Chelsea’s hopes of more silverware this season, as they strengthen their squad again despite being seven points clear at the top of the WSL, in their pursuit of a sixth consecutive title. Sonia Bompastor’s side are also through to the League Cup semi-finals, the fifth round of the FA Cup and the Champions League quarter-finals.The 27-year-old would be eligible to be registered for Chelsea’s Champions League squad for the knockout stages and therefore could theoretically be set for a reunion against her former side if they were to meet in the competition this season. The quarter-final draw takes place on Friday 7 February.Walsh has helped Barcelona win back-to-back Champions League titles in the past two seasons, but is believed to have told the Catalan club that she wanted to be closer to her family.Arsenal targeted Walsh last summer and she was reportedly the subject of a bid from the club, who have been heavily linked with her for several months. Her move to Chelsea will be seen as a bitter blow to Arsenal, who were also interested in Girma before her decision to join Chelsea.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Rangers steadied themselves and in the 18th minute their striker Cyriel Dessers headed a looping Tavernier free-kick wide of the target. Moments later Tavernier worked a short corner on the left with Cerny, whose cross to the back post was headed in by an unmarked Raskin for the simplest of openers.In the 29th minute the USG striker Franjo Ivanovic poked the ball past Jack Butland, after the hesitant Rangers defenders failed to deal with a long free-kick into their box but after a long VAR check, the Polish referee Damian Sylwestrzak signalled offside.View image in fullscreenVaclav Cerny doubles Rangers’ lead at Ibrox.Photograph: Stuart Wallace/ShutterstockIt was a let off for the home side and encouragement for their opponents, although Dessers had the ball in the net just before the break only to be ruled offside. Just before the break Mohammed Fuseini came close to levelling as he knocked a cross from Ousseynou Niang just past the near post but Clement’s team went into the interval in a tantalising ninth place.Rangers were let off the hook again soon after the break when Tavernier brilliantly blocked a drive from Fuseini, who had rounded Butland, and Ivanovic somehow missed the target from the loose ball.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rangers’ defence looked more at ease but USG kept them on their toes and Mac Allister headed over Butland from a searching free-kick to envelope the stadium in nerves.The USG substitute Kevin Rodríguez hooked a shot over the bar in the final minute of the 90 before Dessers missed a chance at the other end in added time, with Rangers holding out to avoid the playoffs.“It’s not only being in this top eight,” said Clement after the match. “If you look at all the teams that finished behind us, there are really massive clubs with massive budgets. But also in this top eight, from the seven other teams, we played against four of them. So that makes the achievement only bigger, I think.”“It’s about every game believing in yourself and I believe that on the day we can win against every opponent, whoever it is,” the Rangers manager added. “That’s what the team showed also when we played against Tottenham or Manchester United who are massive clubs. That belief, you need to have otherwise it’s no use going on the pitch.”Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueRangersUnion Saint-Gilloisematch reportsShareReuse this content"

She’s direct and explosive, with huge natural talent and ability.”Kelly hadbeen increasingly frozen out at City, making only one start in the WSL this season amid reports linking her with a move. On Wednesday she released a statement on social media accusing City of dictating who she could and could not join.Kelly also said she accepted she has no future at City beyond the end of her contract which expires in June, breaking her silence after weeks of speculation about her future, seemingly in a last-resort plea to be permitted to leave. Kelly’s statement added: “The situation has dragged on far too long, it’s disappointing and not right. Ultimately I just want to be happy again.”The Austria defender Laura Wienroither has signed for Manchester City on loan from Arsenal for the rest of the season, but the deal is not directly tied to the move for Kelly. The full-back Wienroither has players ahead of her in the pecking order at Arsenal, and the club were happy to help her secure more regular game time for the rest of the season.Elsewhere on a busy deadline day, the WSL’s bottom side Crystal Palace bolstered their defensive options with two international-level signings, by adding the Netherlands defender Aniek Nouwen on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season and signing Jamaica’s Allyson Swaby for an undisclosed fee from Milan.Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballArsenal WomenManchester City WomenWomen's Super LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Villa are also exploring alternatives, including a more like-for-like Durán replacement, but have no desire to sell Watkins, the subject of a bid worth about £60m from Arsenal.Surreal, dreamlike, confusing: a night watching 18 Champions League tiesRead moreUnai Emery is driving a move forMarco Asensiobut there are doubts over whether the Paris Saint-Germain forward, who is available for transfer, would be interested in the move. It is a similar picture withJoão Félix, who joined Chelsea from Atlético Madrid for about £42m amidserious interest from Villalast summer and has previously expressed reservations about joining.Durán, who has scored 12 goals in 29 appearances this season, is poised to move to the Saudi Pro League club for an initial fee of about £65m. Durán has scored several significant goals in this campaign, including the winner against Bayern Munich in October.Villa hold an interest inMathys TelbutTottenhamare thought to be frontrunners in the race, having reportedly opened talks with Bayern Munich to sign the 19-year-old forward for €60m (£50.2m) before Monday’s deadline.Al-Nassrhave also moved for the Brighton wingerKaoru Mitomabut have had a €65m (£54.4m) offer rejected. Brighton are understood to be determined not to sell Mitoma, who signed a new contract worth about £80,000 a week in October 2023 and will have two years on his deal at the end of the season. The 27-year-old is believed to have no interest in playing in Saudi Arabia at this stage of his career.Villa swiftly dismissed Arsenal’s first approach for Watkins but Emery has stopped short of saying the striker will not leave before Monday’s deadline. “Every player can be in the market in case it is good for the player, for the club and for the team,” the Villa manager said after his team hadqualified for the Champions League last 16on Wednesday. “But to get this deal, of course we are going to be very demanding. And Watkins is our striker.”View image in fullscreenBrighton have turned down a bid of £54.5m from Al-Nassr for Japan winger Kaoru Mitoma.Photograph: Dave Howarth/CameraSport/Getty ImagesVilla, who will face Sporting, Club Brugge, Borussia Dortmund or Atalanta in the last 16, are hopeful of completing a deal for the Chelsea defender Axel Disasi after a move for Sevilla’s Loïc Badé collapsed over personal terms. Villa, who have also looked at a move for the Villarreal defender Juan Foyth, are short at centre-back after injuries to Tyrone Mings and Pau Torres. The club have generated £42m in Uefa prize money from qualifying for the last 16, including a £1.7m bonus for securing a top-eight finish.Villa are among the clubs who have trackedTyler Diblingbut there is a feeling the Southampton teenager could be most likely to move to the Bundesliga at the end of the season. Tottenham and Newcastle have been pushing to sign the 18-year-old but RB Leipzig, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund also hold an interest in the forward, who is sidelined with an ankle injury.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are different people, different persons, with different objectives.

The away tie is the week after.Savinho’s chest of the century caps Manchester City’s night of wild mood swings | Jonathan LiewRead moreCity knew that only victory against Club Brugge would secure their ­qualification, rescuing an erratic group-phase campaign, and they flirted with disaster when trailing 1-0 at half-time. The second half was ­better, the substitute Savinho ­helping to make the difference, although it was reasonable to wonder how City would fare against a European heavyweight with this kind of performance. The time is short to the meeting against the league leaders in Spain or Germany.Akanji’s faith in himself and his teammates was pronounced. He said Pep Guardiola had told him on the pitch after the full-time whistle it would be Real or Bayern next. Akanji could only see the possibilities.“Obviously it’s not the team you want to face but we’re ready and we’re looking forward to the ­challenge,” the central defender said. “I think we can beat every team in Europe. It [the group phase] wasn’t the way we wanted it to be but here we are right now and I’m still confident we can beat whoever comes next.”Akanji was asked whether he felt City could repeat their Champions League triumph of 2023. “Definitely,” he said. “Even though we didn’t play as good as we used to, I think no team wants to face us.”That much is true, the Real ­manager, Carlo Ancelotti, saying: “We don’t like to play against City … they have more chances to win the Champions League.” The other ­possible opponent for Real and ­Bayern in Friday’s draw is Celtic.Ancelotti and his Bayern ­counterpart, Vincent Kompany, the former City captain, are surely ­mindful of what City can be when everything comes together. Yet they have fired only in fits and starts since the end of October. They were good in Saturday’s3-1 home winover ­Chelsea. The previous Wednesday, they had capitulated to lose4-2 at Paris Saint-Germain. Against Club Brugge, they were flat and predictable, then energetic and incisive, although the Belgian team did continue to threaten for a while on the counter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

City will be boosted against Real or Bayern by the availability of their January signings – Omar Marmoush, ­Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis. It is also hoped that all their injured players bar Rodri will be back – namely Rúben Dias, Nathan Aké, Jérémy Doku and Oscar Bobb.“We beat Chelsea at the weekend, a really good win, well deserved, a good performance,” Akanji said. “The performance before against PSG wasn’t as good as we wanted it to be but I still think if we give it our all and we work together on the pitch, we are one of the best teams in Europe. We have to prove it match after match and we didn’t do it yet this year.

Someone who was dealing with catering was not what we were looking for.”Farooq said he first believed he had been discriminated against when he saw on LinkedIn in May 2023 that a temporary staffer called Anna Garnett, who had limited experience, was fulfilling the role.However, the tribunal heard, she had been brought in to cover some basic administrative tasks before the successful candidate, Zac Foley, was able to take up the position.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the stage she carried out the shortlisting again, with the intent to reduce the number of 444 applications to a more manageable number, there are no facts or inferences from which we could conclude it had anything to do with the claimant’s race.”One of two magistrates sitting with her disagreed, believing that Farooq should have been taken forward for interview.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s very nice to have met him and for him to have presented that to me.”Vukic will be second up at the RoyalTennisHall on Friday, against 21-year-old Leo Borg, 21-year-old son of former great, Bjorn Borg.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

England have never done so in the tournament’s history, however, with France and Wales the only nations to host Friday night matches since the first in 2009.French rugby needs some Dupont magic to blow away clouds of scandal | Andy BullRead moreEngland overcame logistical and traffic issues to play their 2015 World Cup opener against Fiji at Twickenham on a Friday but the former chief executive Ian Ritchie flat out refused to entertain the idea during the Six Nations when organisers made similar attempts to encourage more nations to do so.Two of England’s three home matches this year kick off at 4.45pm on Saturdays – the other is on a Sunday at 3pm – and that remains the RFU’s clear preference for transport, operations, commercial and safety reasons but insiders have not ruled out Friday night fixtures at Twickenham if it suits broadcasters. Last August, Twickenham played host to a World Cup warm-up match between New Zealand and South Africa on a Friday night and attracted a crowd of more than 80,000.The existing TV deal for the Six Nations – a shared arrangement between the BBC and ITV – ends after this year’s championship. Organisers are open to a deal involving a subscription broadcaster and TNT is known to be strongly considering a bid. An arrangement that would see some of the tournament remain on free-to-air is considered a realistic possibility but it would remain to be seen whether England home matches – which are currently all shown on ITV – would go behind a paywall.Until that deal is finalised, the fixtures for next year’s championship cannot be scheduled. The suggestion is that more flexibility from all unions on kick-off times could make bidding for the TV rights more appealing to broadcasters. In June, meanwhile, the British & Irish Lions will play a warm-up match on a Friday night in Dublin against Argentina before heading to Australia.Staging Friday night matches at Twickenham would not come without hurdles, however. The RFU was forced to defend its crowd control measures after concerns were raised following the November defeat by South Africa amid fears of crushing in a car park while Twickenham rail station always reaches gridlock on match days. A key part of the RFU’s stadium masterplan, however, is to reduce reliance on Twickenham station.In October, the RFU launched a consultation project with Richmond and Hounslow councils in an effort to stage more non-rugby events at Twickenham. At present Twickenham is only able to stage three concerts a year with a limited capacity of 55,000. The union wants to increase that to 15 and at full, 82,000 capacity in an effort to compete with Wembley and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Doing so would generate significant income to go towards the planned Twickenham rebuild, which, if carried out in its entirety, would cost around £660m.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

CVC had earlier lost out to Reliance Industries Ltd, owners of Mumbai Indians, in a three-way auction for the equivalent stake in Oval Invincibles.‘We’re not gonna be woke’: Middlesex chief risks ECB wrath over new diversity rulesRead moreThe winning bid by Reliance, who are chaired by Mukesh Ambani, India’s wealthiest person, is understood to be worth about £60m, placing the overall value of the Oval Invincibles at £123m. It means the England and WalesCricketBoard (ECB) raised £100m on the first day of the process and is on course to meet its initial target of £350m. The money will be redistributed to the counties and the grassroots game.London Spirit has been valued by those involved in the process at about £150m, which would bring in another £75m for theECB, while the Manchester Originals’ valuation is forecast to be close to £100m. The London Spirit auction will take place on Friday along with that for Cardiff-based Welsh Fire, with those for Manchester Originals, Northern Superchargers, Trent Rockets and Southern Brave due to follow next week.Reliance and Knighthead will now enter a six-week period of exclusive talks with Surrey and Warwickshire respectively, as well as the ECB and its financial advisers, in order to complete the deal.View image in fullscreenBirmingham City chair Tom Wagner brought American football legend Tom Brady into the club’s ownership group.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAAs well as the strong valuations, the identity of the first two winning bidders will be viewed as encouraging by the ECB. In addition to their vast resources, the Ambanis are hugely influential within India, while the governing body has actively courted American owners linked to football clubs throughout the process.Knighthead is controlled by hedge fund manager Tom Wagner, who has unveiled ambitious plans for a new stadium since buying Birmingham City, andincludes legendary American football quarterback Tom Bradyas one of the club’s shareholders.Assuming the Reliance deal goes through, it will see Oval Invincibles added to a sporting portfolio that includes Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League and WPL, MI Cape Town (SA20), MI Emirates (ILT20) and MI New York (Major League Cricket).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last summer he led the French sevens team to victory in the Paris Olympics in – shut your eyes and picture it – one of the great seven-minute stretches of sport, with two tries and an assist as they came back from 7-0 to beat Fiji, who had never lost a match in the Olympics, andwin France’s first gold medal.Dupont’s return heralds fizzing new era for what could be a spectacular Six Nations | Robert KitsonRead moreSix months later, Dupont is back to try again for the other target. His chance in the 2023 World Cup has gone, ended by that one-pointloss to South Africa in the quarter-finals, but he has been talking about how motivated he is by the thought of winning the next one, in Australia in 2027. After he skipped last year’s Six Nations to prepare for the Olympics, he leads his gifted team into this tournament, starting with Wales on Friday night at the Stade de France, knowing that, in the words of L’Équipe, it is past time for the “coronation of the golden generation”. For all the tries this French team have scored, for all the Tests they’ve won, that grand slam in 2022 is still their only trophy.Fabien Galthié defended their record in theSix Nationsthis week. They have finished second in four of the five tournaments since he took charge of the team, behind Ireland in both of the last two. “In six years we’ve won 80% of our matches, that’s out of the ordinary,” he said. “For me, a grand slam and four second places is very good.” But for a player like Dupont, very good isn’t good enough. “There’s a lot of disappointment with this team’s track record, given its potential,” Dupont said this week. “This frustration must be transformed into motivation.”If it were only the winning, that would be one thing. But, surprising as it might be to the rest of us, whose chief experience of French rugby iswatching them drub everyone else in the Champions Cup, the sport here is in crisis. The French Rugby Federation (FFR) is running an €18m (£15m) operating deficit, and the headlines this week haven’t been about Dupont’s comeback, but Galthié’s decision to pick Hugo Auradou and Oscar Jégou on the bench.Auradou and Jégou were arrested after being accused of a rapeduring a drunken night out on France’s tour of Argentina last summer, and while the case was dismissed in December, an appeal will take place on 10 February.View image in fullscreenAntoine Dupont celebrates after scoring a try during the Olympics men’s sevens final, one of the highlights for French rugby in the last year.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianGalthié refused to be drawn on the selection this week. “I’ve answered these questions a lot and today, it’s the announcement of the French team and the players who deserve to play,” he said. ‘I’m going to focus solely on these questions. We’re going to focus on the match against Wales, on the Six Nations tournament and on questions that concern rugby.” But the French press and public aren’t about to let him get away so easily, and the decision has sparked public comment from a range of former players, as well as pundits, lawyers and even philosophers.The FFR brought in a new code of conduct after the tour, which stipulates that no one is allowed to drink alcohol without the express permission of the coaching team, and that guests are only allowed in communal areas. “High-level rugby plays a social and cultural role of prime importance in France,” it states. “Every member of a French team must contribute to preserving an exemplary image.” Which has only prompted questions about why they felt able to select Auradou and Jégou when the appeal has yet to be held. The players, who deny any wrongdoing, had been stood down indefinitely and were only deemed eligible for selection again when the initial case was dismissed.It wasn’t an isolated incident.Melvyn Jaminet has been banned for 34 weeksafter he posted an Instagram video promising to “head-butt the first Arab I see”. BastienChalureau was included in the World Cup squad even after he was given a six-month suspended sentence for assault. L’Équipe has just premiered a documentary called Rugby: The house is on fire, which includes interviews with the former partner of Hans N’Kinsi, the Beziers lock who was sentenced to 18 months for domestic violence, a group of female players from Bobigny who were racially abused by the opposition during a match last year, and a hotel owner whose property was ransacked by a group of Top 14 players.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The French need a reason to feel good about the game again, and fast, especially when the FFR’s development strategy has been all about using the Rugby World Cup, and the Olympics, as an opportunity to build its popularity outside its old heartlands.It won’t be easy. After Wales on Friday night, France play away games against England, Italy and Ireland before finishing off with another home game against Scotland. They have a handful of injuries, too, to their defensive captain Gaël Fickou, his fellow centre Jonathan Danty, lock Thibaud Flament andwing Damian Penaud. There’s such strength in depth in the French game that Galthié has been able to replace them all easily enough, and the coach has his star fly-half Romain Ntamack back too, as well – of course – as that man Dupont.

In reply Cornish said: “Our board and our committees are incredibly diverse … and meet all the diversity standards that we need,” although that will not be case under the terms of the newECBagreement with the counties.The new County Partnership Agreement beginning includes enhanced targets for diversity and gender parity, most notably the stipulation that 40% of appointments to county boards and governance committees must be female. Previously the threshold was 30%.There are four women on Middlesex’s 13-strong board and the club’s committees are 79% male, so changes will be required to comply with the CPA, the mechanism through which the ECB distributes around £120m of annual funding to the professional game.The ECB’s Equality Diversity and Inclusion action plan 2025-28, which was published last October, states: “In the new County Partnership Agreement there are enhanced standards, including a requirement of 40% minimum of each gender, and updated ethnic diversity targets to reflect the 2021 UK census.“This action plan will be underpinned by an annual operational plan – a series of detailed tasks to deliver on the commitments. We will publish annual progress updates, as well as a detailed State of Equity inCricketreport in 2026.”The ECB hands out millions to each of the 18 counties and have powers to withhold funding if diversity targets are not met. Middlesex have had a difficult relationship with the ECB in recent years, and in September 2018 were fined £50,000 and given a suspended points deduction for mis-spending funding that had been allocated to the county to support youth-team and grassroots cricket. The possibility of losing more funding would be a major blow to a county who have not recruited any overseas players in the past two seasons due to financial restrictions.“Our board and our committees are incredibly diverse,” Cornish said at Middlesex’s members forum, which was a private event. “They meet all the diversity standards that we need. But being blunt, we’re not gonna, I hate the word, but we’re not gonna be woke and just do political correctness for political correctness.“The club is governed and run by a very, very diverse group of people. It’s unfortunate you’ve got our three ugly mugs here now. But I don’t think anyone, including anyone that was plonked on this presentation group just because they were of a certain gender or ethnicity would value that either.“We have regularly had our CFO [chief financial officer], Illa Sharma, on every forum since she’s been at the club, she just is not at this one today. So we are fully committed to that, but neither will we go through tokenism either. That’s even worse.”Middlesex and the ECB have declined to comment on Cornish’s words. His comments raised eyebrows among some Middlesex members, particularly as the issue of diversity has caused the club problems in the recent past. In 2022 the then chair, Mike O’Farrell, was criticised strongly after he told a parliamentary select committee that cricket’s lack of diversity was down to black players preferring football and rugby and the Asian community prioritising education.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Part of that is because it’s a rather more time-consuming sport than some others. So we’re finding that’s difficult.”Despite widespread criticism, including from the first black woman to play for England, Ebony Rainford-Brent, Cornish defended O’Farrell and he was made a life president of Middlesex at the end of his term as chair.The ECB’s enhanced EDI targets are a direct response to the damning report from the Independent Commission for Equity in CricketThe lack of gender parity in the professional game is stark, with no women among the 18 county chairs, only one chief executive and only 11% female representation on county boards.Explore more on these topicsMiddlesexECBCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

The suit originated in 2021 when Trump sued the social media company for suspending his accounts after theJanuary 6 attackon the US Capitol. The settlement wasfirst reported by the Wall Street Journaland has been confirmed by a Meta spokesperson.The majority of the settlement, $22m, will go toward a fund to pay for Trump’s presidential library, according to the Wall Street Journal. The remainder will pay for legal fees and go to other plaintiffs listed in the case. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump’s lawsuit against Facebook, which is now under parent companyMeta, was one of several he brought against social media companies in the wake of January 6. He also sued YouTube, Twitter (now X) and those companies’ executives. A federal judge dismissed the suit against Twitter. The Google suit was closed in 2023, but has the option to be reopened.Groups helping Americans find abortion pills report Instagram ‘shadow-banning’Read moreShortly after the insurrection at the Capitol, Facebook suspended Trump’s accounts. At the time, the president was using the platform to spread false claims around election fraud and to repeatedly say he won the 2020 election.Facebook broke with its hands-off approach for political leaders and updated its rules to allow for suspensions of lawmakers to be used in “exceptional cases” during periods of civil unrest and violence.Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO, said the company came to the decision because, “we believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great”.The company gave Trump the maximum penalty under those rules, suspending his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely.“They shouldn’t be allowed to get away with this censoring and silencing, and ultimately, we will win. Our Country can’t take this abuse anymore!” Trump said at the time. He later said, “Next time I’m in the White House there will be no more dinners, at his request, with Mark Zuckerberg and his wife. It will be all business!”A few months later, Facebookdowngraded the suspensionto two years. And, at the two-year mark in 2023, the companyreinstated Trump’s accessto the platform. Twitter and YouTube also allowed Trump back onto their platforms.Zuckerberg has now made it onto Trump’s good side. He met with the president several times over the last couple of months and sat front row at the inauguration.

Microsoft, currently OpenAI’s biggest shareholder, also joined that roundLast weekOpenAIand SoftBank teamed up with Oracle to form Stargate, which Donald Trump called “the largest AI infrastructure project in history”. The partnership aims to build datacentres for AI systems, with an initial spend of $100bn.Citing multiple sources with knowledge of the talks,the FT saidSoftBank’s equity investment would cover the Japanese company’s commitment to Stargate. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and an influential figure in the Trump administration, has claimed Stargate’s backers “don’t actually have the money”.OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, replied on Musk’s social media platform, X, that the funding claims were wrong: “This is great for the country. I realize what is great for the country isn’t always what’s optimal for your companies, but in your new role I hope you’ll mostly put US first.”OpenAI received a competitive jolt this month fromthe emergence of the Chinese rival DeepSeek, after its latest chatbot went to the top of the Apple free app store and sent AI-linked stocks plunging on Monday.Although Altman initially said that he was impressed with DeepSeek and that it was “legitimately invigorating to have a new competitor”, the company later said it had evidence that Chinese startups were “constantly”using OpenAI’s technology to develop competing products.The OpenAI equity investment proposal, led by the SoftBank chief executive, Masayoshi Son, has been vetted by senior executives and the board at OpenAI, the FT reported.

Profit also declined year-over-year.Tesla’s shares fell about 4% in after-hours trading, then recovered and rose 4%. On Thursday, after New York opened for trading, they rose 2.4%.Elon Muskpresented theTesla Cybercab, which he called a self-driving taxi, at a demonstration in October, and he said during Wednesday’s earnings call that the model would go into production in 2026, though Tesla has a long history of delayed releases. Musk added that Tesla’srobotaxibusiness would start in June this year, though what shape it will take is unclear. The company also announced that an advanced version of its Model Y sedan would go on sale in March. Tesla is under federal investigation for the alleged use of its full self-driving feature in multiple fatal crashes in the US.Tesla shares fall as company reports first decline in annual deliveriesRead more“This is not some far-off, mythical situation,” he said. “2025 is going to be a pivotal year for Tesla.”Musk’s electric carmaker has struggled in recent years to compete with cheaper alternatives to its electric vehicles from competitors such as China’s BYD, which overtook Tesla in the last quarter of 2023 to become the world’s top electric manufacturer of electric vehicles. Tesla regained the top spot for the first three quarters of 2024, thanks in part to steep price cuts.In its earnings report on Wednesday, Tesla reported 495,570 deliveries for the fourth quarter and 1.8m for the full year. This is the company’s first annual decline, which follows a year of repeatedly failing to meet quarterly delivery targets in 2024.European subsidies for electric cars have declined, hurting Tesla in that market, where October registrations of Tesla vehicles fell by 24%. Some Wall Street analysts expect demand for Teslas to increase after the US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates.Tesla’s disappointing delivery numbers point to its offerings failing to woo new customers last year. The trapezoidal, Hot Wheels-esqueCybertruck, released in November 2023 after lengthy delays and priced at roughly $80,000, has produced sales numbers that have not compensated for the decline in demand for Tesla’s older models.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company posted $48.39bn in fourth-quarter revenue and earnings per share of $8.02, handily beating Wall Street projections of $46.9bn and $6.75 in earnings-per-share.“We continue to make good progress on AI, glasses and the future of social media,” saidMark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO. “I’m excited to see these efforts scale further in 2025.”The day before, an internal memo leaked that said Meta’s Reality Labs division, which oversees itsMetaRay-Ban smart glasses, had grown by nearly 40% and beaten all its sales and revenue targets.Microsoft to report fourth-quarter earnings amid uproar over DeepSeek’s AIRead more“This is going to be a really big year,” Zuckerberg said on a call with analysts. “More than usual, it feels like the trajectory for most of our long-term initiatives are going to be a lot clearer by the end of this year.”Earnings were preceded by a Wall Street Journalreportthat Donald Trump signed an agreement to call on Meta to pay $25m to settle a lawsuit he filed against the company in 2021. Trump filed the lawsuit after Facebook banned him from the platform following the January 6 Capitol attacks. It is unclear if that caused the delay in reporting earnings.The company was not providing full-year revenue outlook for 2025 but expects “first-quarter total revenue to be in the range of $39.5-41.8bn”, according to a press release. That projection is less than analysts were expecting for the first quarter, which analyst Debra Aho Williamson, founder and chief analyst of Sonata Insights, said was “concerning”.“Meta’s solid revenue growth in the fourth quarter masks a looming problem,” said Williamson. “Its revenue outlook for Q1 was lighter than Wall Street was expecting, and it is planning exorbitant capital expenditures for AI infrastructure in 2025. That adds up to a concerning situation.”Earlier this week, Meta announced it was rolling out a more personalized AI assistant. The tech giant also maintains that Meta AI is the most used virtual assistant, though it is difficult to avoid using it on platforms such asInstagramand WhatsApp by design.Some analysts remain bullish about Meta’s AI capabilities despite the overnight success of Chinese competitorDeepSeek.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The comparisons end there, as tonight we expect a doubling down on the AI vision/build-out from both tech stalwarts Meta and Microsoft, which will be another strong sign of confidence this AI revolution is just starting,” said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. Microsoft reported its quarterly earnings the same day as Meta.Analysts also expected AI would take a back seat to concerns over Zuckerberg’s decision toget rid of third-party factchecking programs. Forrester VP and research directorMike Proulxsaid: “Meta’s typical AI progress update will get overshadowed by analyst concerns about advertiser brand safety and user backlash.”However, Zuckerberg said people were interpreting the announcement as a sign that the company “didn’t care about adding context to things” or did not take misinformation on the platform seriously. But he said that was not true. “The community notes system is just going to be more effective than what we had before,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call.Meta chief financial officer Susan Li said the company had not seen a noticeable impact on advertising in the aftermath of announcing the content policy changes. “We’re continuing to see strong advertiser demand,” Li said. “Our commitment to brand safety is unchanged.”Days after Meta announced it wasdoing away withits third-party factchecker program, news broke that the company wouldreduce its workforceby 5% – this time targeting what it called “low performers”.“Despite a rather frenzied start to 2025, Meta’s Q4, 2024 results will likely demonstrate continued company momentum heading into this year,” Proulx of Forrester said. “With yet another 5% reduction in workforce announced, Meta’s 2024 ‘year of efficiency’ gets trumped in 2025 with an apparent year of ‘intensity’.”Zuckerberg said he was also watching to see whether TikTok is banned – which could provide a windfall for Meta products.

The iPhone-maker’s revenue rose by 4%, coming in at $124.30bn, barely above estimates of $124.12bn. Earnings per share were $2.40, just ahead of analysts’ expectations of $2.35.Shares rose more than 8% in extended trading after CEO Tim Cook indicated in an earnings call on Thursday thatAppleis on the trajectory for revenue growth next quarter.Investors have been concerned about decreasing iPhone sales inChina, the world’s biggest smartphone market, as domestic rivals like Huawei have grown. On Thursday, their fears materialized: Apple reported that iPhone sales fell by 11.1% in China in the first quarter and missed Wall Street’s expectations for iPhone revenue.On the earnings call, Cook said Apple has a base of 2.35bn active devices, which was up from 2.2bn a year ago.Despite the lackluster report, Cook called it “our best quarter ever”, citing the 4% rise in revenue. He touted the company’s foray into generative AI with its Apple Intelligence feature, which debuted for English-speaking iPhone users at the end of October. Cook said it was “unlocking new possibilities for our users” and that the company had seen strong sales where Apple Intelligence is available and weakening numbers where it is not, including in China.Investors have been paying close attention to Apple Intelligence, which has progressed at a slower pace than its competitors and received mixed reviews. The AI-powered product, the company’s first using generative AI, was highly anticipated, but the tech has been riddled by inaccuracies and hallucinations.During the earnings call, Cook assured analysts that the AI tech “will go mainstream”. Apple Intelligence is only available on new devices and in a handful of countries, which accounts for the slower adoption, Cook said. “Once you start using the features, you can’t imagine not using them anymore.”The company’s earnings come during a bleak week for US tech stocks. After the Chinese AI company DeepSeek saw its app hit the top spot in Apple’s App Store on Monday, stock prices tumbled for many tech companies –wiping more than $1tnfrom the leading US tech index. The chipmaker Nvidia broke record lows, seeing the biggest ever fall in US stock market history, losing nearly $600bn off its market value in a single day, though it recovered some value the following day.More broadly, the tech sector regained its footing after Microsoft and Meta beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations with their earnings reports on Wednesday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This comes even as China is under strict chip export controls.Apple appeared to be insulated from the crash, with its stock even notching up earlier this week. Analysts say that because Apple is focused on integrating its AI as a product into devices, it can keep costs lower than if it were building expensive cutting-edge models.Despite that, Apple has experienced a rough start to 2025 with its stock prices falling roughly 8% through the first three weeks of the year, largely due to concerns around declining phone sales in China.Apple Intelligence has also come with glitches and a knack for inaccurately summarizing facts in push notifications. The BBC filed a complaint with Apple in December saying the tech company’s AI feature was generating fake news attributed to the broadcaster.In one notification summary, Apple’s AI wrote: “Brazilian tennis player, Rafael Nadal, comes out as gay.” Nadal is from Spain and is married to María Francisca Perelló. In another, Apple falsely said that Luigi Mangione, who is accused of killing the UnitedHealthcare CEO, had shot himself, which is also untrue.Applesuspended the news summary featureearlier this month.

The family in question are the Stauffers – married couple Myka and James and their children – who were, until very recently, colossally successful family vloggers.Director Rachel Mason’s series starts slowly, spending most of the first hour introducing the uninitiated to the world of YouTubers who specialise in filling their channels with videos of their gorgeous homes, gorgeous children and perfect lives, and to the fans who glom on to these affectless yet somehow intimate and generally wildly aspirational portraits of domestic bliss. “I was literally a part of their life every day,” says former devotee Hannah Cho. She and around 700,000 subscribers to The Stauffer Life channel watched as Myka revealed positive pregnancy tests, had babies, a miscarriage, gave house cleaning tips, appraisals of her post-partum body and altogether so much desirable content that she began to accumulate sponsorship deals and the family’s videos became the family’s (very) lucrative business.An Update on Our Family: the utterly shocking tale of the ‘family vloggers’ who ‘rehomed’ their adopted sonRead moreThis set-up could and should have been whipped through in half the time. The real meat of the documentary is what happens when you need to keep feeding the beast you have created. When your incomedepends on monetising your family, where does that lead? And can it possibly be anywhere good?Engagement with their channel goes through the roof when the Stauffers decide to adopt a three-year-old boy with special needs from China, whom they call Huxley. Myka has the name picked before she meets him, though no one around her seems to note that renaming a three-year-old child, and especially one with special needs, from a different culture, who is about to be yanked from it, is an extraordinary thing to do. But on they went, exhaustively documenting the process, including the first disastrous meeting with Huxley. Or “Huxley”. It dawns on a tearful James that the boy “had a full-blown mom” in his foster carer. “Poor kid,” he whispers.The determinedly cheerful journey back to America is filmed and packaged for their waiting, avaricious online audience. The demand for updates thereafter is insatiable, and for a couple of years they keep coming, including ones about the behavioural issues caused by Huxley’s autism and at least one from Myka noting that “he grieved so hard” and that she was “unprepared for what trauma truly looked like”. Then Huxley disappears from the family videos. Then previous videos containing him are deleted. Subscribers bombard the channel with questions. In 2020, the Stauffers posted a tearful video entitled An Update on OurFamilyexplaining that though they love him with all their hearts, Huxley has had to be placed with a different “forever family” better able to cope with his needs, the extent of which they had not fully understood at the time he was adopted.Their subscribers, and then – when the story went viral – the rest of the internet, took this news about as well as you would expect. A small amount of compassion was swamped by horror and disgust, by insults, anger, vitriol (directed mostly at Myka as a foul perversion of the maternal instinct), then death threats, then raging conspiracy theories that the Stauffers had sold him, killed him and God knows what else.Mason’s film raises questions about just about every compelling issue of the internet age. It looks at the ethics of parents filming children who cannot give consent and who would in any professional, paid context be subject to myriad safeguarding regulations. It looks at the parasocial relationships that develop between content creators and followers, and the dangers of “betraying” those attachments. It poses questions about the purity of creators’ motives, and when a line is crossed between the natural human impulse to share, even show off, the good things in one’s life and the need to curate an impossible perfection, especially once it becomes sponsored by rich brands. It looks at the optimism, arrogance and entitlement that can play a part in transnational adoptions. And it looks at those who jump on to an emotional bandwagon not because they were invested in the original story but because they are malevolent trolls dedicated to spitting into open wounds wherever they find them.The Stauffers refused to be involved with the film and their family channel has been offline since the backlash became uncontainable. So we will probably never know how many of their actions were driven by the greed for clicks, or whether it was simple benevolence throughout. But it is hard not to be reminded at every turn that the internet is the greatest unregulated experiment ever performed on humankind. And even harder not to conclude that, if it were possible, now might be a good time to end it.An Update on Our Family aired on Sky Documentaries and is on Now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionSocial mediaFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Bodies were being lifted from the river’s icy waters through the day.Mass-fatality airplanecrashesare mercifully rare. The last one in the US wasin 2009. But a crash in such a sensitive location, where aircraft congestion has been an ongoing controversy, will always attract unusual attention. It was also all too probable that the human tragedy would become a pawn in the jarring politics of the second Donald Trump administration, which has already turned its vengeful beam on theFederal Aviation Administration(FAA), which regulates civil aviation, airports and air traffic control systems.That probability duly became a certainty within hours of Wednesday’s disaster, when Mr Trump posted his own provocative version of the questions he believes are posed by the crash. “Why didn’t the helicopter go up or down, or turn?” he asked. “Why didn’t the control tower tell the helicopter what to do instead of asking if they saw the plane?” The crash “looks like it should have been prevented. NOT GOOD!!!”By any normal standards, this would have been an extraordinary intervention. But this is a president who, in his first week in the White House, had already picked an inflammatory fight with the FAA over safety. Last week,in an executive order, he ordered it to end the diversity, equity and inclusion rules in its hiring policy. He also ordered the agency to review the performance and standards of all FAA employees in “critical safety positions”. Tasteless and inappropriate though it is, Mr Trump’s post signals his readiness – which he did nothing at all to dispel in Thursday’s press conference – to blame the FAA for the Potomac tragedy.But it may also highlight a certain vulnerability. There is no direct connection between Mr Trump’s determination to slash the federal workforce, truncating its regulatory functions, and this week’s midair crash. But his ambitious assault on the role and power of government, conducted behind a smokescreen of anti-diversity propaganda, sits uneasily alongside tendentious attacks on a trusted air traffic control system on which the public has just been forcefully reminded that it depends.If so, it may align with other signs that Mr Trump’s administration will not have things quite its own way. This week, the president tried tofreezeall government grants and loans, putting at risk programmes ranging from disaster relief to cancer research. The move caused chaos for claimants and employees. But a judge has now stayed that effort, and Republican lawmakers are facing a politicalbacklash. It would be some consolation if this terrible loss of life, underscoring the uncompromisable importance of public safety, prompted a similar public and political reaction against Mr Trump’s shameless attempt to wreck the FAA.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Why?Robert ReichThese new initiatives are not about shrinking the size of the federal government. They’re about centralizing control in Trump’s handsThu 30 Jan 2025 06.30 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 12.29 ESTShareChaos on a huge scale.On Wednesday, Trump rescinded an order he had made late on Monday night that froze up to $3tn in federal grants and loans.That Monday-night order had caused wild confusion across America.Hospitals, schools, non-profits, research organizations, pre-school programs and police departments wondered if they lost federal financial support.The Medicaid system that provides healthcare to millions of low-income Americans was interrupted.By Tuesday afternoon, a federal judge had temporarily blocked the order in response to lawsuits claiming that Trump had no authority to freeze funds allocated by Congress.Attorneys general in 22 states and the District of Columbia, all of them Democrats, had joined together to stop the order.So, on Wednesday, in the midst of this chaos, Trump’s acting director of the office of management and budget (OMB), Matthew J Vaeth, notified federal agencies that the Monday-night order had been “rescinded”.What are we to make of this?The scale of Trump’s Monday-night order was wildly broad. It argued that federal spending must be aligned with “presidential priorities” while reviews are undertaken and gave officials until 10 February to report to the OMB.By then, the OMB will likely be run by Russ Vought, Trump’s nominee – and, not incidentally, the chief author of Project 2025, the blueprint for Trump’s takeover of the US government.My betting is we’ll see another version of Monday night’s order emerge once Vought is installed. It will be somewhat more detailed to avoid the confusion of the first attempt. But the Trump White House views the order as essential. It’s part of a much larger plan.Last week, in a separate initiative, Trump barred certain spending he disagreed with, including programs involving “diversity, equity and inclusion” and non-government organizations he believes undermine the national interest.He also ordered a 90-day freeze on all foreign aid spending, which has jeopardized congressionally authorized foreign assistance, including military aid to Ukraine and the distribution of medications in Africa and developing nations.All of this is illegal.Under the US constitution, Congress holds the power of the purse, and Congressapproved– that is, “appropriated” – all these payments.Trump’s attempted takeover of the US government is part of a larger strategy to replace democracy with an oligarchyTrump, like any president, has the power to pause previously appropriated spending to review it, but Trump’s freezes are not really about pausing. They’re aboutstopping. That’s called “impounding”.In 1974, Congress enacted theImpoundment Control Actin response to Richard Nixon’s attempts to not spend funds Congress had appropriated. The act prohibits a president from doing this.Trump believes the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional. But the supreme court determines what acts of Congress are not constitutional. In the 1975 case ofTrain v City of New York,the supreme courtunanimouslyupheld the constitutionality of the act.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Otherwise, they risk being furloughed – that is, not being paid – or fired.The likely author of this memo isElon Musk, the richest person in the world, whom Trump tapped to become head of the so-called “department of government efficiency”.When Musk fired 80% of Twitter’s employees on taking over the firm in 2022, he used the same language that headed this week’s memo to federal employees: “A fork in the road.”But make no mistake. These new initiatives arenotabout shrinking the size of the federal government. They’re about centralizing control of the federal government in Trump’s hands.Trump aims to put people into these jobs who are more loyal to him than they are to the United States.Trump’s attempted takeover of the US government is itself part of a larger strategy to replace American democracy with an oligarchy.Concentrated power promotes concentrated wealth, just as concentrated wealth promotes concentrated power.

Setting aside the question of whether they should use a term widely considered an ableist slur, that very debate was revealing, for a number of reasons.The former and now current president’s narrow but nonethelesstriumphant victoryin November made clear that America’s so-called “wokeness movement” is in an advanced stage of decay. And if Trump’s first week back in the White House serves as any indication, he intends to further accelerate the process.During hisinaugural address, he vowed to “end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life”. The days to follow saw him make good on that pledge. He issued anexecutive orderterminating “illegal DEI” throughout federal agencies, revoked a Johnson-era anti-discrimination hiring rule, and threatened government workers with “adverse consequences” if they don’t snitch (in a Stasi-esque fashion) on colleagues who resist his purge.Corporate America took notice and quickly followed suit. On Friday,Targetannounced it would roll back its diversity, equity and inclusion programs, joining other commercial giants like Walmart, McDonald’s, Amazon and Meta. This is not all too surprising; big business has nakedly, if not erotically, signaled its willingness to accommodate Trump since the day after the election. What’s more curious is the lack of pushback from Democrats. Sure, MSNBC was sent into a tizzy; however, asnotedby the National Review, an open letter promising to protect DEI from state-level Democratic lawmakers managed to garner a mere 39 signatures. For context, there are 7,386state legislatorsin the US.To borrow a term fromCharlie Sykes, the “clown with a flamethrower” took aim at wokeness and set it ablaze. Some will be overjoyed by this reality; many others will be devastated by its consequences. However, what’s most interesting is how it seems an offshoot of the social movement has already emerged from the ashes.On the morning of inauguration day, #DarkWoke begantrendingon Twitter/X. The hashtag – ostensibly a tongue-in-cheek reference to “Dark Brandon” – emerged in reaction to an exchange between the Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and thefar-right influencerChaya Raichik.Over the weekend, Ocasio-Cortez posted anInstagram Reelin which she explained her lack of interest in attending any inaugural festivities. “I don’t celebrate rapists,” she says bluntly. Raichik, whose social media account @LibsofTikTok is widely recognized for proliferating the anti-LGBTQ+ “groomer” moral panic, shared the video, declaring “another person Trump should sue”.The congresswoman then retweeted Raichik, stating: “Oh, are you triggered? Cry more.” Thepostaccrued more than 17m views, and in the process it birthed both a meme and a debate about Democrats’ approach to messaging for the next four years.From 10,000ft, #DarkWoke appears to be little more than an internet exercise ofdirtbag leftgallows humor. The most viraltweetassociated with the hashtag reads: “my Grandma voted for Trump so i made sure she fell down the stairs.” Attached to the post is a – presumably – staged photo of an elderly white woman recoiling in pain.Anotherexamplepairs an image of the Philadelphia Flyers’ official mascot, Gritty, waving a Pride banner with the caption: “When he bludgeons homophobes with that flag that’s #DarkWoke.” One could dismiss the whole affair as black-pilled shitposting – aimless, nihilistic musings from a despairing online left. It would be a mistake for Democrats to come to this conclusion.As Ezra Klein argued in anessaylast fall, “disinhibition is the engine of Trump’s success. It is a strength. It is what makes him magnetic and compelling on a stage. It is what allows him to say things others would not say, to make arguments they would not make, to try strategies they would not try.” Disinhibition, Kleinasserts, is Trump’s primary trait as a person; he acts in front of a camera just as the newly minted defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, does after atriple cocktail breakfast.Over the course of the Trump era, the president has forcibly installed disinhibition as the primary trait of the Republican party. #DarkWoke is a demand forDemocratsto embrace it too; it’s a call for the party to fight the messaging war that actually exists, not the one they wish existed.Should liberals start usingslurs? No – and anyone who seriously entertains such a question has no business crafting comms strategy. It’s clear that Democrats’ current approach to messaging, however, is broken – and party leaders have no conception of how to fix it.The most successful Democratic communicators are those who have made a concerted effort to reject risk aversionAt a Senate Democratic luncheon last week, Cory Booker attempted to walk his colleagues through strategies to reach voters in the modern media environment. According toreportingfrom CNN, the best model they could come up with was a video of the senator Mark Warner making a tuna melt. Yes, in the same week Bishop Mariann Budde enjoyed a 72-hour news cycle for summoning the courage to call Trump a bigot to his face, Democratic lawmakers decided the secret to electoral success was sandwich tutorial videos.On a New York Timespodcastearlier this month, the MSNBC host Chris Hayes attempted to explain the fundamental asymmetry that exists between Democrats and Republicans with regard to the “attentional ecosystem”. Democrats, Hayes argues, “still believe that the type of attention you get is the most important thing. If your choice is between a lot of negative attention and no attention, go for no attention … the Trump side of the Republican party believes that the volume, the sum total of attention, is the most important thing. And a lot of negative attention: not only fine – maybe great.”The Democrats who have emerged as the most successful communicators in the last few years – Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, Senator Chris Murphy, Senator John Fetterman, and the aforementioned Ocasio-Cortez – are those who made a concerted effort to reject this conventional risk aversion. Theycurse, they go onFox News, and they’re extremelyaggressivein calling out their conservative counterparts. They’ve renounced the long Democratic tradition of bringing not a knife to a gun fight but a butter knife to a bazooka fight. Their messaging reflects the urgency of this moment.In response to the Trump administration’smoveto freeze trillions of dollars in federal grants and loans, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, should not have waited hours upon hours to finally issue a marble-mouthed,oddly sexualstatement from behind a podium. No, the most talented Democratic communicators should have been immediately deployed to nursing homes and pre-schools in their respective districts. They should have taken to Instagram Live and decried – with F-bombs aplenty – the utter inhumanity of throwing the future of Medicaid and Head Start into doubt.Maga’s approach to media strategy is shock and awe, overwhelming and all-consuming. It’s the border czar, Tom Homan, riding along with armed Ice agents with film crews in tow. It’s cosplay, yes – but it’s darkly captivating cosplay. Democrats cannot beat that with a counter-strategy as well thought-out and executed as the withdrawal from Afghanistan.In Trump’s America, disinhibition and transgression – not tuna melts – are the most powerful signifiers of authenticity. #DarkWoke is a plea for liberals to recognize this reality.Peter Rothpletz is a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsDemocratsOpinionUS politicsUS CongressUS SenateHouse of RepresentativesAlexandria Ocasio-CortezDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Trump has the political power; Musk has endless moneyThu 30 Jan 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 06.02 ESTShareTwo men, two huge egos, two quests for endless amounts of power and money – joined, for now, in the pursuit of those common goals. That’s the story behind the tight relationship betweenDonald TrumpandElon Musk, the billionaire who hangs out in the West Wing of the White House and has the ear of the president.But there are cracks in the facade of closeness, and – based on Trump’s past intolerance for anything but total loyalty among his allies – one must wonder how long it will last. And should the bromance come apart, it is likely do so with a bang heard ’round the world.To say the relationship is symbiotic is an understatement. Trump has the political power; Musk has endless money.In today’s environment, these go together better than Buffalo wings and Budweiser at a Super Bowl party. Musk was at Trump’s side atMar-a-Lagoon election night and was soon installed in the White House, leading the “department of government efficiency” (Doge), a special group that Trump has created, with its ominously Orwellian-sounding name. He even reportedly joined a post-election call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.The Donald and Elon Show is an unholy mess | Stewart LeeRead moreBarry Blitt’s portrayal on the 20 January cover of the New Yorker, titled Two’s a Crowd, said it all: a widely grinning Musk is sworn in alongside Trump, but getting almost all the spotlight, raising the question of which member of the duo would be the “shadow president”.How does the symbiosis work? The writer Judd Legum has a solid theory as he observes how Trump’s policy toward China has changed dramatically since taking office. During the campaign, Trump promised tariffs of 60% or more, but now he’s down to 10%, or maybe none at all.“How do you explain the sudden shift?” Legum ponders, and then answers. “Two words:Elon Musk.” (The Musk-owned Tesla, which produces a million cars a year, has its biggest factory in Shanghai. You do the math.)What does Trump get out of the arrangement? Recall that Musk gave at least $260m to help get Trump elected, largely through a Super Pac the entrepreneur founded last year. And he used his social media platform, X, to vastly amplify Trump’s message.Those are the kind of things that can really endear one of the world’s richest individuals to a corrupt politician.But will it endure? Some have their doubts, as Musk declines to show utter fealty to the narcissist who demands it. In recent days, he has publicly criticized the president’s$500bn artificial intelligence deal,trolling the OpenAI CEO,Sam Altman, on X.“It’s clear that (Musk) has abused his proximity to the president,” one Trump ally told Politico. “The problem is the president doesn’t have any leverage over him.”Trouble in paradise? Some observers think it’s inevitable.“We now have a situation where neither one of them has played the No 2,” as the Cornell law professor and tech policy expert Sarah Kreps told Axios. That’s not exactly comfortable.Americans, according to a Wall Street Journal poll, are skeptical of the tech bro’s influence, with half of respondents saying it’s a bad idea for Musk to advise Trump and less than 40% approving. Musk’s overall approval rate among Americans has plummeted, and Trump – always ready to say “you’re fired” – is sure to notice.It may be that the duo’s huge amounts of power and money will keep them bonded, like the White House version of holding a marriage together “for the children”.But should they turn on each other, the parting could be ugly. Trump thrives on insult and revenge. And Musk – with his Nazi salutes and his destructive streak (witness what he did to Twitter) – is ruthless.I don’t know what, exactly, that breakup would look like, but I can’t wait for the New Yorker cover. If these two did not possess the frightening ability to do great harm on a global scale, it could be entertaining.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionElon MuskDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Witnessing the recent anti-Jewish hatred is shockingAnthony LevinIn the face of those who refuse to see our humanity, I choose to imagine that we are humane enough to believe in theirsThu 30 Jan 2025 17.28 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 20.09 ESTShareMy grandmother,Holocaustsurvivor Olga Horak OAM, passed away in August 2024 just days after her 98th birthday.Just one week before, she attended her great-granddaughter’s Jewish day school to share her remarkable story of survival with the Year 6 students. Her parting message was simple: “Never forget. Don’t hate.” Although she could no longer stand up straight, in her decades-long commitment to Holocaust education as a volunteer at the Sydney Jewish Museum, she was indefatigable until the end.When she died, we lost an empire of knowledge. Just as we do whenever we lose a survivor. Her strength of character, her disarming candour, her twinkly eyes, her testimony and her light have secreted themselves in the hearts of the thousands of people she touched, like little mirrors reflecting flashes of her life. A giant photo mosaic.For my great-grandparents, for all Jews, for all humanity, I say never again | Mark DreyfusRead moreTo carry on her legacy is a heavy burden and one fraught with vicarious trauma. Postmemory ripples and reverberates. As grandchildren, we cherished weekends with our grandparents, but come mealtime, Auschwitz cast its long shadow. I sat quietly with wide eyes, listening to stories of hiding places, denouncements and dangerous border-crossings. I learned all too young of Nazi sadism and the deprivations of camp.Author and second-generation descendant Eva Hoffman describes it aptly in her book After Such Knowledge: “I had grown up with the subliminal expectation of catastrophe, and the received ‘memory’ of mass death in my very bones.”Bones meant something else. If I left one on my plate at dinner, mostly eaten, my grandmother would pick it up. “Do you know what I would have done for this in Auschwitz?” she would say, waving the bone at me, the joint taking on the shape of a familiar accusation.Growing up with this inheritance, I internalised a paradox: on the one hand, I learned that the world is suspect. Henceforth I suppressed my Jewish identity. On the other, I grew complacent about the threat of antisemitism. I rolled my eyes at her dire pronouncements. I situated the Holocaust firmly in the past, where it belonged. I naively assumed that Auschwitz had somehow inured history to the possibility of repetition.In no small part because of what my maternal grandparents endured, I have dedicated my professional life to helping the disadvantaged. As a human rights lawyer, I have fought for nearly two decades against discrimination in all its forms. I have seen the harmful impacts of racism and persecution on many different minoritised communities.Yet witnessing the explosion of anti-Jewish hatred in Australia since 7 October 2023 is something I never thought I would see in my lifetime. Every day, the newspaper is “but a tissue of horrors” as Baudelaire once wrote – albeit now a widget which scrolls up or down at the flick of a finger. Horrorbegone. Though the after-image remains.Statistics tell only half the story. In December 2024, the Executive Council of Australian Jewryreported a “massive increase”in the number of antisemitic incidents in Australia. Even then, theAustralian Human Rights Commissionsays data on racism is limited. Meanwhile, in the untrammelled expanses of the internet, US non-profitCyberwell founda 36% increase in online antisemitism between 2023 and 2024.Despite being 98, my grandmother was not spared this modern form of hatred. When she moved into aged care in late 2023 after a bad fall and had to sell her home, there was an article which mentioned that she was a survivor. In the comments underneath were several anti-Jewish attacks. One joked about her having a “cool tattoo”. Another fantasised about burning her house down.Seeing swastikas and synagogues burning in 2024 summons collective traumas to the surfaceThis is the other half of the story. A phenomenon beyond statistics. How many Jewish Australians have felt that “received memory” in our bones? How many of us have experienced, over the last 15 months, the crumbling of our shared humanity, the “dizzying upending of basic assumptions” as Hoffman put it. That people are decent. That the past is the past. That we are safe to proudly express our Judaism without fear of reprisal.“Keep your wits about you. Make sure no one follows you to your car,” my wife said to me as I left the house to give a speech at the commemorative function at the Great Synagogue in Sydney this week. Sadly, this is where we are. The history of violence against Jewish communities is somewhere embedded in the ancestral filaments of our being. Seeing swastikas and synagogues burning in 2024 summons collective traumas to the surface, prickling the hairs on the skin like a millennium of hackles. Many of us are for the first time experiencing what it is to be hated in the abstract, as a member of a group – completely detached from any personal beliefs we may hold.1:59Jewish leaders condemn synagogue attack that 'should not occur on Australian soil' – videoI don’t profess to have easy answers to this age-old antipathy. Right now, we are all being called upon to preserve our empathy, even when engaging those with whom we disagree.Respectfuldialogue is as much about how we have conversations as it is what we say.This is precisely what we have been practising through Holocaust education for decades: bringing the stories of survivors to the world and inviting others to make an empathic connection.In the face of those who still refuse to see our humanity, I choose to imagine that we are humane enough to believe in theirs.Anthony Levin is a human rights lawyer and writer.

They need more democracy, not less, and soon.The Channel 4 poll found that52% of 13- to 27-year-oldsthink “the UK would be a better place if a strong leader” were in change “who does not have to bother with parliament and elections”, and 33% thought the country would be better run “if the army was in charge”, among other dark impulses.I have doubts about the value of springing kneejerk, contextless questions on people. (Does anyone want a “weak” leader? Was there a follow-up question: “Do you want the right to get rid of a leader you hate?”) Psephologist Peter Kellner reckons “it’s more a top-of-the-head response indicating a general sense of pessimism, disillusionment and disengagement than a thought-out view of how society should be organised”. It’s a spasm, much likePeter Finch in the film Networkleaning out of the TV studio window and shouting: “I’m mad as hell and I’m not gonna take this any more!”But some working knowledge of politics matters.Citizenship educationflowered briefly when David Blunkett as education secretary made it compulsory in England, with specialist teachers. But it was killed off byMichael Gove dropping itfrom his Ebacc, along with bursaries for teachers training in it. Officially, it’s still compulsory for state-maintained schools – academies are not curriculum-bound – but it’s often absent, left to form tutors, untimetabled. Ofsted barely checks, and what’s not inspected gets ignored.Five times fewer pupils take the GCSE than 15 years ago, according to Liz Moorse, chief executive of the Association for Citizenship Teaching.This latest poll should spur the national curriculum review to restore it, when it reports in March. Forget memories of grim “civics” lessons, citizenship is nothing like that. At Priory school in Southsea, Hampshire, headteacher Stewart Vaughan and his specialist citizenship teacher Helen Blatchford promote it enthusiastically, not just to study but as democratic practice running right through the school, with a school council, consultations on the curriculum and priorities for spending capital. Students there “know they are heard”, says the head, even if they don’t get the final say. Blatchford has submitted her evidence to the curriculum review about the good effect of citizenship education on the whole school.Critical thinking is its core, which means learning about problem-solving, weighing evidence, making arguments and learning how to agree and disagree. Students run mock elections and take practical collective action with local councillors and voluntary groups. Teaching media literacy, debunking myths and identifying reliable online sources is not easy, says Vaughan. “They are overwhelmed 24 hours a day by a volume of online material: we can’t keep up. We only hope to equip them to filter unreliable sources, but schools can’t do this alone. It needs families, and government regulation of these sites.”Difficult subjects are not ducked. Gaza arouses strong passions, so they discuss Middle Eastern history, conflict and identity, Vaughan says, “with impartiality, listening to students’ stories. They are opinionated, but respectful of arguments.” Where better to debate Andrew Tate’s misogyny? Forty of the school’s year 10s choose citizenship for GCSE. Plentiful studies showgood effects rippling through schoolsthat teach it seriously.Voting at 16 and 17 would affect schools and teenagers profoundly. Politicians eagerly pressing the flesh in care homes would turn to schools and colleges with equal solicitude for the young. In Scotland and other countries where 16-year-olds vote, Dr Christine Huebner of Sheffield University finds, they vote more than the 18-24s – perhaps because they live at home and are encouraged by their schools. But once 18-year-olds leave for colleges and universities elsewhere, registration plummets – their lives are disrupted and they move frequently, “with crucial NI numbers often left at home”. Huebner wonders if that’s exactly what David Cameron intended whenhe banned colleges and universitiesfrom registering all students: young votes “fell off a cliff” with hisindividual voter registrationfrom the 2015 election, she says.Voter ID rulespassed by the Tories in 2022, another anti-youth gerrymander, allowed pensioners’ travel passes for identity but not young people’s travel cards.No, the kids are really not all right. Honestly, can you blame them? | Marina HydeRead moreThe ability of schools, universities and colleges to register students needs to be restored, alongside automatic voter registration, to stemfalling turnout. Here’s why voting at 16 is crucial: if someone votes once, it’slikely to become a lifelong habit. Many of the never-voted secretly fear getting it wrong at the polling station because their literacy or English is poor, covering it with a bluff: “They’re all the same!” But if every pupil were taken to the school’s local polling station by a teacher and everything explained (including the option to spoil their ballot), that habit would start right there. I would make the quid pro quo for votes at 16 a compulsion to vote that first time, but good citizenship education might make that unnecessary. Electronic voting is essential – and again, barred by the Tories to deter the young.There are too few 16- and 17-year-olds in any constituency to significantly shift the dial, even if they all voted for the same candidate (and they are as diverse as other age groups, says Huebner). But would George Osborne’s austerity have targeted their educational maintenance allowances and their housing benefits, or closed youth centres, if MPs were soliciting their votes?Generation Z has grown up since the 2008 crash and knows only stagnation, dwindling life chances and vanishing home ownership, so no wonder47% of them told the Channel 4 pollthat “the entire way our society is organised must be radically changed through revolution”. Citizenship education makes them more tolerant and more supportive of democracy and increases their intentions to vote, but it won’t assuage that indignation. It should channel justified anger into political action to force Westminster’s attention.The government says votes at 16 will definitely be law “in good time ahead of the next general election”: speed it up. If anyone thinks young people are too stupid, just spend a day out canvassing.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionElectoral reformLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

My grief’s sharpness has worn down, and I’m ready to lean into the soft landing of older ladiesThu 30 Jan 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 14.40 ESTShareIrecently had a realisation about myself: I have entered “nanna mode”. This does not mean I’m knitting, drinking enough cups of tea to kill Paddington Bear, or showing the ceiling instead of my face on video calls – nonetheless, I have become steeped in Nanna.I’ve always had a soft spot for older ladies (and ladies of all ages). But I had this lightbulb moment while watching Matlock, a reboot of an 80s TV show starring Kathy Bates as a lawyer in her 70s coming out of retirement – and getting up to shenanigans.I have watched Bates on screen since I was a child and I loved every role and genre, every era. But I have found myself particularly enjoying watching her as an older woman, being a charming scamp, using her age and wisdom as an advantage in a society set up to disadvantage elderly people. I thought about what else I’d been watching and, in what would be quite a boring movie-type montage, it came to me that it was all older-lady focused. This was not a deliberate move on my behalf, but once I thought about what was happening, I understood that it was, of course, becauseI lost my own beloved nannaa couple of years ago. The hardness and sharpness of my grief had worn down a bit, and I was ready to lean into the soft landing of some older ladies.When it comes to the vulnerabilities of age, patients deserve sympathetic oversight, not turning a blind eye | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreWhat is “old” is relative, of course. In our youth-obsessed culture, it’s not often that we get to see stories or portrayals of people older than 35, and so the category is flexible. But my particular nanna mode indulgences have includedLet Them All Talk(I’ve now seen it three times), which is about many things but the short version is that it’s Meryl Streep and Candice Bergen (two of the most beautiful women on the planet) as friends fighting on a luxurious cruise ship. I cannot think of anything better. There’s the one where a group of beautiful older ladies form a book club to read Fifty Shades of Grey, ingeniously called Book Club, and of course, the sequel where the ladies from the book club go to Italy. I’ve seen Poms, the film where Diane Keaton gets into cheerleading. I’ve even seen 80 For Brady, where 80-year-old women go to an NFL match to meet footballer Tom Brady. Why did I watch it? Because it’s got older ladies going around doing stuff. I’ve watched Margo Martindale’s new show, where she pulls a maple syrup heist, which is a real thing. I’ve watched the new Ted Danson show set in a retirement home, where all the retired ladies want to have sex with him (rightly). If it has an older woman, I’m there.I had been mainlining nannas, somehow, without really realising why. None of these women even remind me specifically of my nanna, a loving and funny woman, spirited and determined. OK, maybe she’s a tiny bit like if Kathy Bates from Matlock had been raised poor and ended up solving mysteries while cleaning toilets instead of being a lawyer. The point is she was special in completely her own way. Many people believe that about their grandmothers, and they are right.View image in fullscreenRebecca Shaw and her grandmother.I have been delving into these worlds, spending time with old people, clearly looking for something to remind me of her. It hasn’t been like early on, when reminders that she was gone made me sad. Instead, I’ve been getting reminders that she lived. I’ve been drawn to stories about women who have bonded, who have grown old together and formed community. One of the main themes of my nanna’s funeral was how many good friends she had for decades, cackling down the phone for hours, gabbing and gossiping until the literal day she died. She and I had a special bond because of our sense of humour, too, and she’s in the air when I laugh at one of these films. My algorithm began to change, too, because it knows me better than I know myself. A trickle of grandmother content quickly grew to a torrent. If someone posts something that features an old lady, I’m stopping my scroll, and my eyes have already filled with tears. But it’s not unpleasant; it is lovely, and it helps.So bring me your movies and shows about older ladies. Bring me your Instagram stories about your nannas, your babas, your mee maws, your abuelas, your nonnas, your yia yias, your sitas, your nanis. If you can, take time out of your life to appreciate yours. Call, check in, hang out, gossip, hold hands, laugh. We could all go more nanna mode.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsGrandparents and grandparentingOpinionAgeingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

But he’s wrong to say it’s ‘culture’ preventing other dads doing the sameThu 30 Jan 2025 07.41 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 12.25 ESTShareThe start of a pregnancy is always a time of some uncertainty, but when my partner and I learned we were expecting our second child last year I was faced with a question I hadn’t experienced with our first: would I be able to take any paternity leave? The nature of my work involves working contract-to-contract and I was due to start at a new organisation within days. Britain’scurrent paternity leave system, fundamentally unchanged since it was implemented in 2003, only entitles fathers or other co-parents to leave if they have been with the same employer since the pregnancy began.The exclusionary nature of paternity leave in the UK has felt like a long-neglected issue in our politics, leading to the emergence of new campaigns such asthe Dad Shift. So the news that the Scottish secretary, Ian Murray, will bethe first cabinet minister to take full paternity leave– a decision signed off by the prime minister – is a welcome and overdue indication that the people running our country at least have some understanding of the realities facing new parents today.It is clear that Murray has an admirable commitment to fathers playing an active role in raising their children, as demonstrated by his decision to release the news publicly. But, given this, it was disappointing to see him state in his announcement that “the biggest impediment to paternity leave is culture” and that “from a wider policy perspective, I think it’s really important for dads to know they can take it” – claims that suggest the government hasn’t fully grasped the challenges fathers and other co-parents face.Although Murray is right to challenge any cultural issues that prevent fathers taking paternity leave,the evidence is clearthat the overwhelming majority of fathers want to take leave, but too many face barriers rooted in the outdated and dysfunctional policies available to them. As well as it being limited by length of employment, the UK offersthe lowest paid paternity leave in Europe, with a duration far below the12.7 week averageamong Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.It is unsurprising, then, thatpolling commissioned by the Trades Union Congress(TUC) has found that the most common reason for parents not taking paternity leave was financial pressure. Uptake of paternity leave is lowest among households with smaller incomes, while less than a third of self-employed co-parents – who have no entitlement to paternity leave – take any time off at all, compared to 79% overall. Similarly,research conducted by the charity Pregnant Then Screwedfound that one in five new fathers had no leave options available to them and 62% of second parents would have taken more leave if statutory paternity pay were higher. Cultural barriers to taking leave predominantly rested with employers, with both surveys finding that many fathers felt pressured to curtail their leave or continue working during it.I am very fortunate that my employer is allowing me to take leave, despite my not being eligible for statutory pay, but the pressures of my contract ending later in the year means it will be shorter than I would like. I am also ineligible to take any shared parental leave when my partner returns to work, denying me the opportunity that I had with my eldest child to spend an extended period of time together one-on-one, strengthening our relationship and my confidence as a caregiver. Shared parental leave was introduced to enable fathers to take longer periods of leave but has manifestly failed, withan uptake of only 5%among new co-parents. It has many of the same barriers posed by statutory paternity leave, such as a lack of eligibility and low pay, as well as any leave being taken away from the mother’s allowance, rather than being exclusively for the co-parent.Academicresearch has shownthat the countries that are most successful at encouraging fathers to take leave offer them extended periods of protected time – which they have to “use or lose” – combined with a high level of pay.Although the UK government is currently legislating to make paternity leave a “day one” right in Britain, it does not plan to alter the length of time or pay available to new co-parents, meaning the new policy is likely to have a limited impact on uptake. It would also not help the many self-employed fathers who, unlike mothers, do not have any right to statutory pay.There are promising signs beyond Murray’s announcement that the government may make some of the changes needed to enable more fathers to take time off when their children are born.Labour’s manifestopromised a review of parental leave within its first year of office and the MP Stella Creasy hasproposed an amendmentto the employment rights bill, supported by many of her colleagues, calling for protected paternity or parental partner for all employees. But to make a real difference, they need to go further: extend statutory paternity pay to self-employed fathers; offer a longer period of leave, exclusively for co-parents; and accompanying this with an increase in pay available, at the very least for those on lower incomes who receive the least support right now.As I approach my second experience of paternity leave, I can only hope the government builds on its warm words and makes the necessary reforms to ensure no other fathers face anxiety or obstacles to spending time with their newborn children.Tommer Spence is a researcher and freelance writerExplore more on these topicsMaternity & paternity rightsOpinionParents and parentingIan MurrayFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

After 14 years of environmental vandalism, it might have seemed impossible forLabourto offer anything but improvement. But on green issues, this government is worse than the Tories.The last prime minister to insist that growth should override every other consideration, and to fling insults atanyone who disagreed, was Liz Truss. She called those of us seeking to defend the living world an “anti-growth coalition”, “voices of decline” and “enemies of enterprise” who “don’t understand aspiration”.Now Keir Starmer has picked up her theme and run with it. Those who challengegovernment policiesthat might promote GDP growth, however destructive and irrational, such as the planned expansion of Heathrow, Gatwick, Luton and Doncaster Sheffieldairports, are “time-wasting nimbys”, “zealots” and“blockers”, engaged in “self-righteous virtue-signalling”.After all, these are the kind of people who might send “congratulations to the climate campaigners” whose legal challenge stopped plans to build a third Heathrow runway at the court of appeal. Or who insist that Heathrow expansion should be blocked because “there is no more important challenge than the climate emergency”. Oh, hang on, that was Starmer, writing in 2020. You know, the one you voted for, not the new model, channelling the worst Tory prime minister of modern times.Now his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, insists that growth “trumps other things”, including the government’senvironmental commitments. The verb is unfortunate. The government’s new rhetoric is horribly reminiscent of the convicted felon: monomania, slogans and insults take the place of nuanced and complex policy.It makes sense to improve east-west rail links and construct more reservoirs and offshore windfarms, as Reeves promisedin her speech, and we urgently need new, genuinely affordable housing (alongsidesystemic change in the housing market). But there’s no justification in a climate emergency for airport expansion or new trunk roads, such as her Lower Thames Crossing. The “sustainable aviation fuels” the government plans to rely ondon’t exist, and won’t materialise at scale.Reevesmocks environmental concernin true Trumpian fashion, claiming that people object to schemes like the third runway she has just announced at Heathrowbecause they “might add something to carbon emissions in 20 years’ time”. There’s no “might” about it. They will. But who cares what happens in 20 years? It won’t be her problem.Of course, this also means that such projects won’t deliver growth for 20 years, either. In fact, some evidence suggests that airport expansiondoesn’t deliver growthat all. But even if it did, and the growth were used to fund new hospitals (a big if), we’d have to wait 20 or more years for that dividend. Is this really the policy?View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves delivers a speech on economic growth at Siemens Healthineers in Eynsham, Oxfordshire, 29 January 2025.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesAn alternative would be to build hospitals now. As they are huge employers and help people return to work, they would appear more likely than airports to generate growth, as well as meeting our urgent needs. But a full hospital building plan is now aless urgent priorityfor the government than airport expansion. This contributes to the impression that, like Truss, when Reeves and Starmer say “growth”, what they really mean is meeting the demands of predatory lobbyists.But let’s for a moment take them at their word. Let’s imagine that economic growth should be treated as the overriding national purpose. Let’s ignore the economist who standardised GDP, Simon Kuznets, who advised that “the welfare of a nation canscarcely be inferredfrom a measure of national income”. If this is the agenda, Starmer and Reeves should read a report published earlier this month, not by Extinction Rebellion, but by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. It warns that without immediate and decisive action, climate breakdown couldreduce the size of the global economyby 50% between 2070 and 2090.In other words, if Heathrow’s third runway is built, by 2040 it might or might not contribute a tiny increment to GDP. But it would, if the warning is correct, contribute to a comprehensive economic collapse shortly afterwards. Starmer accuses objectors to such schemes of having “slowed down our progress as a nation”. But when that “progress” is a demented rush towards the precipice, perhaps a slowing down – and achange in priorities– would serve us well.But no – everything must be sacrificed to the god of GDP. For example, though chicken factories (huge steel sheds containing tens of thousands of birds) arekilling the Wyeand many other rivers, Steve Reed, the environment secretary, insists that planning permission for themshould become easierto obtain. Planning is the only effective point of intervention: once the factories are built, the nitrates and phosphates they produce inevitablywrecknearby rivers. They are also likely to kill far more economic value than they create, as they ravage local economies built on tourism and block more benign developments as a result ofnutrient overload. In this and other respects, thegovernment is pre-emptingits ownwater commission, which some of us see as one of thefew signs of environmental progresssince the Conservatives.Last week, in a spectacular act of despoliation, Starmersank the climate and nature bill, whose purpose was to bring government policy into line with its international commitments. Labour ordered its MPs totalk the bill out of time, and threatened to withdraw the whip from those who supported it.Rachel Reeves tells MPs of plans to go ‘further and faster’ in pursuit of growthRead moreThe government’s attack on regulators goes even further than Truss’s. Asbodies such as the Environment Agency, Natural England, theHealth and Safety Executiveand thechemicals agency UK Reachcrumple through a lethal combination of underbudgeting and political hostility, Reeves insists that the job of regulators is to “drive growth”. But that is not their role. They exist to protect us, regardless of the demands of capital. After 15 years of deregulation through budget cuts and ministerial nudges, the results include thedeath of our rivers, thedegradation of our soil, acatastrophic loss of wildlife,air pollutionand noise exceeding safe levels, and atoxic loadwhose impacts on human health we can only begin to guess at. How does any of this improve our lives?But never mind, let’s melt human life and the natural world down into money. GDP, a number whichincorporates great harmsas well as benefits, must trump all else. Then the government will have some numbers to boast about, even if they represent a decline in our wellbeing – our genuine prosperity.These people may be more competent than Truss, but after just six months in power they have become as terrifying in their cold fanaticism and intolerance of dissent.

It starts with asking why Axel Rudakubana, jailed last week with a 52-year minimum prison sentence, did it. But that soon segues into wider issues of statecraft and policy. In particular, it asks whether there are measures we could now take that might, just possibly, contribute to stoppingsome future Rudakubanafrom doing the same thing.Here the issues become more substantive. Problems of family support and parenting. The too ready availability of knives. The influence of social media. The impact of poverty. The role of schools and of exclusions. The place of policing. The repercussion of imprisonment. The effectiveness of youth services. The relevance, if any, of ideology. All these, and more. And they are merely subject headings, the doors to more detailed responses.After the shock has been articulated, this is where politics and government would most usefully now lead the conversation. Yet, with some exceptions, this is not the debate that politics and government have yet provided. This is a public deficit for which all parties bear a share of responsibility. But it risks a disturbing consequence. It may allow the lessons of Southport to slip slowly and quietly into the British state’s too-difficult box.For Labour, as the party of government, the policy response thus far has inevitably been procedural. The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has set up a public inquiry into Southport, has appointed David Anderson toreview the Prevent anti-terrorism programme, has asked Jonathan Hall KC to report on possible amendments to terrorism law, has promised further restrictions on knife sales, and has opened the door to a loosening of contempt of court law.All this is predictably thorough, even exemplary. Cooper is proving to be one of Labour’s more sure-footed ministers. But hers islargely a defensive strategy. Inevitably, any changes are all in the future, perhaps distantly so. More significantly, everything Cooper says is overshadowed by the government’s own shackles on public expenditure. So Cooper cannot get on the front foot, and Labour backbenchers are not in the business of making her life difficult by raising thorny issues.Remarkably, neither are theConservatives. That’s partly because their 14 years in government bequeathed the Britain into which Southport erupted, as well as bequeathing the British state that was unable to intervene to prevent it. But it is also because the Tories are perpetually looking over their shoulders at Reform. As a result, they too often say what they assume Reform would say, rather than focusing on serious statecraft or policy.In the House of Commons on Monday, there was a prime example of the way parts of the Tory opposition have become sidetracked from the main issues. On Sunday, the centre-right thinktank Policy Exchange published a version of a leaked Home Office internal paper on possible changes to the legal definition of extremism, including misogyny and online disinformation. The paper was not government policy. Yet on Monday, front- and backbench Conservatives queued up to denounce it for nearly an hour as though it was.It all made for high-octane Commons indignation about allegedLabourwokery. But it was not in any way a serious attempt to deal with some of the desperately serious and difficult issues raised by Southport, let alone to bring Britain closer to finding a solution. As such, unfortunately, Monday’s exchanges were all too representative of parliament’s response thus far.View image in fullscreenIdris Elba in his BBC documentary.Photograph: 22 Summers/BBCNo government and no society can wholly prevent a Southport. There is no network of surveillance or preventive intervention that would be both tolerable and effective. Yet there are serious policy options all the same. Some of these were the subject of Wednesday’sBBC One documentary by Idris Elbaon knife crime. Indeed, Elba’s programme would be an infinitely better starting point for serious policymakers than anything that was being said in the Commons this week.There were no culture wars or conspiracy theories in Elba’s documentary, and very little false reassurance either.Elba focused instead on facts. Knife crime has doubled in a decade. There are an average of four knifings a week. Two-thirds of perpetrators are white. Most knives are specialist weapons, not kitchen tools, often bought online, as in Rudakubana’s case.Axel Rudakubana walked a long path to murder. At what point could he have been stopped? | Gaby HinsliffRead moreBut these are not irresistible trends, about which nothing can be done. Elba’s documentary had ideas about what could be done. Social media glorifies knives – restrict it. Prison is expensive and sometimes counterproductive – spend the money on mentor programmes, which, as a police officer in Coventry argued, “definitely work”. School exclusions – the Rudakubana example again – increase the chances of reoffending. Restore youth services budgets after years of starvation.Central though knife crime is to any attempt at a policy response to Southport, other things matter too. The Prevent programme is a mess. It should not be broadened but narrowed, while specialist programmes should focus on the people Keir Starmer has dubbed “loners” and “misfits”. Government transparency and clearer use of language will not eliminate the influence of conspiracy theories and political charlatans, but it will do something to counter them, and it may increase trust.The trouble with politics, one Tory MP observed to me this week, is that it fastens on to the points of disagreement. As Elba’s documentary shows, this is not where the public is at all. The public gets that there is an awful problem, and a lot of fine people are doing what they can to solve it. It is time that politics and government caught up.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

How do we engage with people who mistrust us?Wed 29 Jan 2025 22.19 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 00.28 ESTShareOn Wednesday, a jury found that fourteen members of the religious group “The Saints”were guilty of the manslaughter of eight-year-old Elizabeth Struhs. Two were acquitted of murder.As a doctor and a mother I read the news and felt deep grief.Under the guidance of religious leaders, the family had withheld life-sustaining modern medicine. As little Elizabeth laydying from diabetic ketoacidosis, the adults – her parents among them – were alleged to have prayed and sang, instead of giving her insulin and vital medical care. This was not the first time they had stopped her from receiving medical care: her mother had previously been jailed over Elizabeth’s near-death medical neglect. This was an entirely preventable illness and death. As a parent, I feel sick that a little girl could be abused in this way, under the guise of God’s “healing” powers.I am seeing the rise of anti-medical, anti-science narratives everywhere. A patient in my clinic tells us that she has stopped her HIV antiviral tablets, because her pastor told her she has been healed by prayer. A parent rejects mental health treatment for his impulsive, suicidal teenager, telling me that ADHD and major depression are made-up, modern conditions. A pregnant mother asks me to sign her Advanced Care Directive, saying she declines blood products in the event of a life-threatening bleed during birth, worried that she could receive “vaccine-contaminated” blood. Another tells me she will “free-birth” without midwifery or medical care.I am a midwife in a NSW hospital. This is what an ordinary day looks like | Oceane CampbellRead moreDuring the Covid pandemic, conspiracy theorists distributed junk maps of Covid-19 cases connecting them to 5G mobile phone towers. As a result, I spent countless hours doing community outreach, health promotion work and endless individual consultations trying to debunk pseudoscience and explaining (often unsuccessfully) the risk-benefit ratios of vaccines. In the last year, we have seen outbreaks of pertussis, measles, chickenpox, hepatitis and influenza, often linked to pockets of vaccine refusal.Medical doctors and scientists now face a barrage of anti-science, anti-medicine narratives, and it feels like we are losing the battle. We are no longer trusted instinctively. So how do we engage with people who mistrust us? How do we engage with the narratives that paint modern medicine as evil? The parents of Elizabeth Struhs appear to have truly believed that their God would save her. That they were acting in her best interests. They seem to have believed that science and faith were incompatible.On the one hand, there are many good reasons to challenge medical practice. Medicine, and medical culture, is always evolving. Western medicine is emerging from a patriarchal, hierarchical way of operating. We all need to get better at listening, especially to those who have faced historical discrimination. Medicine holds the same biases as broader society, and these biases need unpicking.My patients are being denied, and in some cases are denying themselves, modern medicine that prevents disease and sufferingMariam TokhiWe need better medical research, more social diversity among healthcare providers, affordable care, more inclusive clinical guidelines, better clinical communication, better teaching. We need to be able to better support those who are stressed, fearful, and not coping with the demands of chronic illness. We need systems that support health workers to take time, listen and thoughtfully acknowledge patients’ concerns, especially for vulnerable families and children.On the other hand, the amount of medical misinformation is overwhelming. For many, the promise of an “all natural” cure is intoxicating: a simpler, purer way of life. As clinicians, how do we walk the tightrope of patient-centred care: how do we respect patient perspectives and preferences, acknowledge our limitations, while clearly signalling the often dangerous nonsense being peddled?On a scale larger than ever, we see misinformation, false promises, faith-healing and fraudulent ‘science’ propagated by TikTok influencers, “wellbeing” whackos, religious leaders, faith healers and some alternative medicine practitioners.Also of concern, US president Donald Trump has signedan executive orderto withdraw from, and defund, the World Health Organization, the global body for evidence-based public health. In recent days, he announced that he would attempt to haltPEPFAR’sglobal HIV medicine distribution. If it had succeeded, it would have meant as many as600,000 HIV-related deaths over the next decade in South Africa alone. Untreated, unchecked HIV could also mean worsening spread and drug-resistance across the globe.1:07'You are!': protesters disrupt RFK confirmation hearing as he claims he is not anti-vaccine – videoThese anti-medical narratives have consequences for individual patients, and for communities across the world. My patients are being denied, and in some cases are denying themselves, modern medicine that prevents disease and suffering. I don’t know how to combat this, except to say that many of us are thinking about it. Worrying about it. Working on it.Our worst sorrow is when vulnerable children who rely on parents and caregivers, are brought into care late, or not at all. In the news articles, little Elizabeth Struhs looks as vital and joyful as my own little girls. She had a well-understood medical condition, type 1 diabetes. It could have been managed. Instead of turning to the medical profession for support, her father turned to a religious group for psychological and logistical support. I am so angry. And I am so sorry that we have failed this little sweetheart: not just doctors, but all of us.Dr Mariam Tokhi is a general practitioner, and teaches narrative medicine at The University of Medicine.Explore more on these topicsHealthOpinionVaccines and immunisationChildren's healthcommentShareReuse this content"

Marianne Faithfull.Photograph: Central Press/Getty ImagesMusicMarianne Faithfull was a towering artist, not just the muse she was painted asAlexis PetridisThe late singer made her share of bad decisions – but someone this artistically adventurous and unafraid was never going to have an ordinary lifeNews: Marianne Faithfull, singular icon of British pop, dies aged 78Life in picturesThu 30 Jan 2025 13.50 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 14.43 ESTShareIt is difficult to think of a moment in pop history less receptive to a 1960s icon relaunching their career than in 1979. At that point, British rock and pop resolutely inhabited a world shaped by punk: it was the year of 2-Tone and Tubeway Army’s Are ‘Friends’ Electric?, of Ian Dury at No 1 and Blondie releasing the bestselling album of the year. And it was a central tenet of punk that the 1960s and their attendant “culture freaks” were, as Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren put it: “fucking disgusting … vampiric … the most narcissistic generation there has ever been,” and that the decade’s famous names should no longer be afforded the kind of awed reverence they had enjoyed for most of the 70s. “No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones,” as the Clash had sung.And yet Marianne Faithfull,who has died aged 78, turned out to be the kind of famous face from the 60s that a world shaped by punk could get behind. She was living proof that the rock aristocracy were remote and decadent and ripe for the culling. Never given the credit due to her by her most famous associates, the Rolling Stones, she had to go to court to get her name appended to the credits of Sister Morphine, a song she had co-written. She subsequently spiralled downwards, at startling speed, from having a seat at swinging London’s top table to life as a homeless junkie. Her years of addiction on the streets had so ravaged her voice that, by the late 70s, it was completely unrecognisable as coming from the woman who had sung As Tears Go By and Come and Stay With Me.So, while Mick Jagger was nastily dismissed in the theme song to the Sex Pistols’ film The Great Rock‘n’Roll Swindle, Faithfull was offered a part in it, as Sid Vicious’s mother. Her comeback gig was at the Music Machine, a bearpit venue where Bob Geldof had been punched in the face mid-song. Moreover, the ensuing album,Broken English, fitted perfectly. It was filled with enough bile, bad language and provocation (what was the daughter of a baroness doing singing John Lennon’s Working Class Hero?) to give Johnny Rotten pause. The songs picked through the wreckage of the decade that had made her famous with unmistakable relish – how the era’s penchant for mind expansion and radical politics had curdled into addiction and terrorism – or railed at the way women were treated: the album is populated by a female cast of suicidal housewives, betrayed lovers and oblivion-seekers.View image in fullscreen‘I was just cheesecake really, terribly depressing’ ... Marianne Faithfull in 1964.Photograph: CA/RedfernsIt was all performed with conviction: she sounded like she meant it. Of course, Faithfull was an actor, but you could also see why she might be genuinely pissed off, and not merely because of her fall from grace. Her initial burst of fame may have looked good from the outside – she was beautiful, she had hit singles, she was the partner of one of the biggest pop stars in the world. But there was something dismissive and sexist about the way she was treated as if she were “somebody who not only can’t even sing but doesn’t really write or anything, just something you can make into something,” she later recalled. “I was just cheesecake really, terribly depressing”.The Stones’ manager Andrew Loog Oldham, who launched her singing career, described her as “an angel with big tits”. The records she made strongly suggested that music came low on his list of priorities: he saw her as a means of living out his fantasy of becoming a British Phil Spector, and as a light entertainer: a pretty, posh girl whose niche would be essaying folk songs for an MOR, Saturday-night variety show audience. When he got his way, the results were horrendous: her version of Dylan’s Blowin’ in the Wind is terrible; her version of Greensleeves, larded with a production that saw Oldham doing his best Spector impersonation, is even worse.But Faithfull was smarter than to fall under the sway of a svengali. She had other ideas about pop music, and, as it turned out, they were better than his. Initially, her best records dealt in a very English, very wintry-sounding brand of orchestral pop: on This Little Bird, Go Away from My World, Morning Sun or Tomorrow’s Calling, the arrangements twinkled like frost; you can imagine Faithfull’s breath forming clouds in front of her face as she sings.The material was lightweight but something about Faithfull’s performances injected a note of eeriness: her vocals were more yearning and melancholy than the songs needed them to be. It was a side of her work that might have developed fruitfully in the psychedelic era, but by then Faithfull had lost interest in singing, apparently content to be Mick Jagger’s muse. It was a role she was good at – it was Faithfull who got him to read Bulgakov’s The Master and Margarita, which inspired Sympathy for the Devil – but it seemed a shame: the first of a number of bad decisions Faithfull made regarding her career.The second was that, having been sharp enough to quickly ditch Oldham as her producer and insist her label simultaneously release two albums – one pop, one folk – she didn’t fight harder to stop her record company pulling her 1969 comeback single Something Better. This was far grittier than anything she’d released before – country-ish, with Ry Cooder on slide guitar – but the problem, as her label saw it, was the B-side, her original version of Sister Morphine: so bleak and so obviously written by someone who knew of what she spoke that they balked and withdrew it entirely.As she sank further into addiction, there were more missed opportunities. A 1971 album, Masques, went unreleased. By the time of its recording, her personal situation was desperate and her 60s producer, Mike Leander, had concocted it primarily as a means of helping her. Faithfull later dismissed its contents but it was better than she thought, the material well-chosen and apropos; her performances raw and vulnerable. Her versions of Phil Ochs’ Chords of Fame and Terry Reid’s Rich Kid Blues were powerful in a way her 60s hits were not. Two years later, she appeared on David Bowie’s TV special The 1980 Floor Show, wearing a nun’s habit, sounding like Nico and duetting with him on a version of I Got You Babe. She could have reinvented herself for the glam era – her public image certainly had a suitable amount of decadence attached – but Faithfull was visibly still in a bad way, and nothing more happened.It took Broken English to finally re-establish Faithfull, even if it initially looked like a one-off. Its followup albums, Dangerous Acquaintances and A Child’s Adventure were less striking and edgy, although the latter’s closing track, She’s Got a Problem, had some of Broken English’s bite. The 1987 album Strange Weather was another triumph, its mood dark and affecting, with Faithfull as a dramatic and gifted interpreter of songs, rather than a writer, on selections ranging from Leadbelly, Tom Waits and Bob Dylan to the Great American Songbook.She repeated the trick with Brecht and Weill songs on the live album 20th Century Blues (1996), and later recorded an entire album of their material, The Seven Deadly Sins (1998). She also began attracting a noticeably hipper class of collaborator than any of her more commercially successful 60s peers. The superb 2002 albumKissin’ Timealone featured contributions from Beck, Pulp, Billy Corgan and Blur (the title track, with Blur, very much in the vein of the looser, more experimental music found on Blur’s album 13, was a particular highlight). The 2005 albumBefore the Poisonwas essentially split between collaborations with PJ Harvey, operating in minimalist garage-rock mode, and Nick Cave.View image in fullscreenA dramatic and gifted interpreter of songs ... Marianne Faithfull later in her career.Photograph: HO/ReutersFaithfull self-deprecatingly suggested that younger artists flocked to work with her because they enjoyed hearing her war stories from the 60s, but the reality was that she was willing to take risks, challenge herself and push at the boundaries of public perception:Easy Come, Easy Goreunited her with Keith Richards, but elsewhere on the same album she covered songs by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and the Decemberists and duetted with Anohni and Cat Power.She would occasionally delve into her history, revisiting As Tears Go By and Broken English’s Witches Song onNegative Capability(2018), or underline her place among the rock aristocracy by tapping Elton John, Lou Reed and Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters for songs or guest appearances. But you would never accuse her of trading on past glories, or of knocking out an album in order to tour and play the hits, as many of her peers were evidently doing.For someone whose public image was inexorably linked with what she had done 50 years earlier, she seemed artistically intent on pressing forward, in establishing herself in a context that had more to do with Anna Calvi and Mark Lanegan than the Rolling Stones. “She walked through the whole thing on her own terms,” noted Warren Ellis, Nick Cave’s latterday musical foil, who co-produced Negative Capability. It’s not hard to imagine Faithfull would have thought that a fitting epitaph.Explore more on these topicsMusicMarianne FaithfullPop and rockExperimental musiccommentShareReuse this content"

The effects are cumulative, taking us on a journey that is filled with variety, tenderness and vulnerability, surprise and shock.Here is a man’s naked leg, foot planted on the floor. There’sWilliam Burroughs, lounging and insouciant,Susan Sontaglooking at the ceiling, a man and his dog sheathed in cellophane, like a gift you didn’t expect. A cow says hello over a fence. Caving in, door ajar, here’s a wrecked white shack, paint peeling and worn away, collapsed on its side in the New Jersey night, like a mendicant dropped exhausted on the way to somewhere else. And now a man on a chair, sucking his own big toe, an image that’s all strain and urge and beautiful contortion.View image in fullscreenPeter Hujar, Self-Portrait, 1980.Photograph: Courtesy of the Peter Hujar Archive/ARS, New York and Pace Gallery, © Peter Hujar ArchiveHujar’s photographs come at you one by one and all at once in a ravishing exhibition that dwells, mostly, on his work from the 1970s and 80s, right up to the time of his death in 1987, from Aids-related complications, at the age of 53. Focus shifts with every step.This show is overwhelming in its intensity, the swerves from subject to subject, from studied portraiture to sudden confrontation, from the studio to the world, from the bed to the church steps on Easter Sunday, and to the abandoned east side piers with their rotting spaces commandeered for sex and for impromptu art shows. Luminous sea mist clings to the corporate towers on Sixth Avenue and there’s a commotion on the quayside, a world of clamour and incident. Often Hujar would photograph all these things on a single day, Rolleiflex camera always in hand.Hung close, the images go by in speeding rows and runs. You come at them askance and face them one by one, and walk them with a slow, measured pace. They surprise and trap you in intimate situations and they run you down. Hujar’s work has a complex musicality. Then we’re on a late-night corner where there’s nothing but a fire hydrant buried in weeds. Further along the cobbled street a pallet and a tyre lean against a wall. Lit by the streetlights, the details look as deliberately placed as sculpture, leading the eye to a car mysteriously parked at a distant intersection. There’s no one there but us and whoever’s behind the lit windows high up and far off in a New York night that’s forever gone.My eye wanders in between things, returns and returns again. There’s such grace hereSome images are grouped in tight grids, filling your field of vision and sending your eye on restless, unexpected and bewildering journeys from subject to subject. The images are mostly square and mostly the same size and hung in matted white frames. There’s no colour, and Hujar was specific with his papers and his silver gelatin prints, all developed and printed in his apartment darkroom. However quick and sudden, or posed and calculated, the shot was, Hujar gave every image time, attending to their calibrated gradations of tonality. His work has tremendous formal rigour and sublety, and a clarity achieved as much in the darkroom as inside the camera.View image in fullscreenPeter Hujar: John Flowers (Backstage, Palm Casino Review), 1974.Photograph: © 2025 the Peter Hujar Archive / Artists Rights Society (ARS), NY, DACS London, Pace Gallery, NY, Fraenkel Gallery, SF, Maureen Paley, London, and Mai 36 Galerie, ZurichHow beautiful and miraculous and complex Hujar’s art is, taking us to open-casket funerals and the backstage corridors of aRobert Wilsonopera, where we meet a guy in fishnets and a gimp mask. We go from a field in Pennsylvania to a glade in Florida, where Hujar’s one-time lover, artist Paul Thek, lies under the trees like an animal encountered in the wild. Hujar explores the cruising grounds of the dilapidated East River piers to a space with nothing in it but a blanket folded on a straight-backed chair. He lovingly records scars on a man’s torso and an arid slag-heap, drawing the eye between the heaps of undifferentiated pewtery dross to a little piece of trash that catches the light. A horse stands patiently in a field, its flank a velvety near-black against a hill whose pale edge softens into an even paler sky, the image is an essay in gradation.Hujar, cigarette between his lips, looks at the camera and squints against the smoke. His self-portraits range from the casual to the studied. He sits naked and looks back at the lens with unfathomable knowingness. He goofs around and sticks a gnarly dildo inside himself. Here’s an ass shot, piss dribbling between his legs. Hujar’s candour demands our own. In 1976, he photographed dancer Bruce de Sainte Croix masturbating. We see the man standing, on his knees and seated. There’s emptiness all around him, an air of silent concentration and self-absorption. The dancer’s foot brushes the lower edge of the image and leads us in. His foot, his face, the shadows under the chair and the space around him are all as compelling as the act itself, stilled. My eye wanders in between things, returns and returns again. There’s such grace here.On one day that same year (1976), Hujar shot a series of photographs of the Hudson and East rivers, filling the frame with the slop and heave of the waters. In one, a trough in the swell becomes a sudden bowl of light. Elsewhere light skitters across the waves like errant scratches on the negative. Sunlight glances on a bubble, the lightest light in the photograph floating against a plummeting darkness that goes down and down. The depth and surface of vision are all there in these mesmeric studies.And then we come to Hujar dead in his hospital room (coincidentally, it is the same room where he had photographed transgender actor Candy Darling as she lay dying of lymphoma 13 years earlier, in 1974). Photographed three times by his artist friend David Wojnarowicz. First the head, then the hands, then Hujar’s bare feet, a harrowing sequence asking only for silence. Nearby hangs a 1985 portrait of Wojnarowicz, weirdly reminiscent of Phillip IV of Spain with his Habsburg jaw, like a Velásquez king in downtown disguise. An earlier 1981 portrait has Wojnarowicz with his fingers in front of his face, eyes downcast. What a quivering, pallid, vulnerable image this is, his forehead smudged with shadow, his fingers a defence against the camera. Past lovers, Wojnarowicz and Hujar shared an uncompromising attitude to art and life. More than that, their enduring friendship may also have been cemented by bonds of trauma and damaged childhoods.View image in fullscreenPeter Hujar: Stephen Varble (III), Soho, New York, 1976.Photograph: © 2025 the Peter Hujar Archive / Artists Rights Society (ARS), NY, DACS London, Pace Gallery, NY, Fraenkel Gallery, SF, Maureen Paley, London, and Mai 36 Galerie, ZurichWhenever you stop you’re on the brink of being swept away again, the pull of another image asking for attention. Even when they are funny Hujar’s images all have a certain gravity, and however quick and unguarded a shot might have been, however casual an image might appear, each photograph evidences Hujar’s meticulous, painstaking approach to his craft. For all his vexations – Hujar’s anger and intemperance and frustrations, his outbursts and volatility and depressions, his poverty and impossibility as a human being, none of this seems to get into his photographs. When you look at his work, all that falls away. Hujar’s unwillingness to compromise and his disdain for the market evidences a consummate discipline. He didn’t, or couldn’t, make things easy for himself.You have to hold on to the images so as not to get snared by backstories and circumstances and rumours and fantasies and all the baggage we carry around with us. His photographs are memorable even when we don’t think we have time for them. They arrest us and won’t let go.Peter Hujar: Eyes Open in the Dark is at Raven Row, London, until 6 AprilExplore more on these topicsArt and designPhotographyPeter HujarreviewsShareReuse this content"

Would you play him again (please)?luckyjim26When they approached me, I thought: does the world really need another Dracula? But Mark [Gatiss] and Steven [Moffat] had done some really cool things with the character. They wrote it as if it came to an end. If we were to do a second series, how do we bring him back? We established that he could actually stand in the sun. I think the idea would be to open the second series with him on a beach in Mexico, with one of those tinfoil screens around his neck, working on his tan.Do you act differently in Danish and English?Bleistiftspitzer3I think I do. I think I have more of a – this is assuming Ihavea sense of humour – more of a sense of humour in English than I do in Danish. It’s weird. I have this one-man play called The Evil, a monologue that I have done a trillion times in both English and Danish. It started in Swedish and has been translated, so the words are the same. I’ve always had the feeling that the Danish is the guitar version; the English is the piano version. They’re the same piece of music, but sound very different.

Jagger is the closest you come to a living legend. They were both so bloody sweet. What really struck me about Jagger was how humble he was. He’s the fish out of the water as an actor, and was always asking: “What can I bring to this to make this better?” He knew everybody in the room had more film experience and was very sweet about it. He was only on set five or six days.

The Amazing James Brown (1961)If you want a roll call of James Brown’s formative influences, just check the covers on this album: Hank Ballard, Roy “Good Rockin’ Tonight” Brown, dirty blues supremo Bull Moose Jackson and Billy Ward’s impressively morbid The Bells, which – never knowingly understated – Brown used to perform on stage with a doll representing his lover’s corpse.19. James Brown Sings Raw Soul (1967)A classic 60s JB album, in that it carelessly throws together singles, tracks from random sessions and live tracks (the version of Tell Me That You Love Me is ludicrously intense). The difference here is the quality of the ragbag material: Bring It Up, Money Won’t Change You, Let Yourself Go, the effervescent sermonising of Don’t Be a Dropout.View image in fullscreenA fine 40 minutes.Photograph: Records/Alamy18. Slaughter’s Big Rip-Off (1973)Brown’s second Blaxploitation soundtrack isn’t a match for Black Caesar (below), often relying on transplanted or rewritten old material. You can see why the film’s producers were annoyed, but if you ignore its origins and simply take it as 40 minutes of music, it works just fine – and the opener, Slaughter Theme, is superb.17. Mutha’s Nature (1977)Brown’s disco years have been much maligned, not least by Brown himself. The standard line is that he ended up sounding like everyone else, which just isn’t true: the rhythms might have changed, but there’s a sweat-soaked rawness to Mutha’s Nature that resembles nothing else disco produced.16. Think! (1960)They say that if you’re going to buy a Brown album, you’re best served by a compilation, and that is particularly true of his early years. But not entirely. Aside from the hits, Think! has a lot to commend it, not least I Wonder When You’re Coming Home and You’ve Got the Power, both haunted by the ghost of doo-wop.15. Get Up Offa That Thing (1976)An album that lies somewhere between funk and disco, with a title track that temporarily reversed Brown’s commercial decline in the US. Quite rightly so: it’s fantastic, particularly in the full-length version here. Moreover, This Feeling, I Refuse to Lose and, especially, the frantic Can’t Take It With You run it close.14. It’s a New Day – Let a Man Come In (1970)The world could probably have lived without It’s a New Day’s thoughts on feminism – “a man can’t do nothin’ no more!” – although its groove is magnificently hypnotic. Elsewhere, there’s the peerless Give It Up or Turnit a Loose, a great remake of It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World and the fabulous, mid-tempo World.13. Black Caesar (1973)Usually a pioneer, Brown was a latecomer to Blaxploitation soundtracks, but had clearly noted the success of Isaac Hayes’ Shaft and Curtis Mayfield’s Super Fly. As with those albums, the music on Black Caesar outstripped the film it accompanied: check out Down and Out in New York City and Make It Good to Yourself.12. Hot Pants (1971)One thing the album format allowed Brown and his musicians to do was stretch out, something they were capable of without a hint of self-indulgence. Hot Pants offers just four tracks: the curiously titled Blues & Pants is a serious deep cut; while Escape-ism’s squealing horns later turned up on Public Enemy’s Don’t Believe the Hype.View image in fullscreenBrown at the Newport jazz festival, c1968.Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images11. I Can’t Stand Myself When You Touch Me (1968)Brown’s 60s studio albums were so wilfully patchy, it’s no wonder the occasional gem gets ignored, but I Can’t Stand It When You Touch Me is a relentless delight. The lesser-known tracks (the instrumental TheSoulof JB, the bizarrely produced stomper Time After Time) are as delightful as the big-hitting title track.10. Live at the Apollo, Volume II (1968)Live at the Apollo’s sequel captures Brown in a period of transition – what would come to be called funk is starting to stir. His band, the Famous Flames, sound as punchy as ever, but there is more space in the songs. Get the unedited deluxe edition, on which It’s A Man’s Man’s Man’s World lasts nearly 20 minutes.9. Soul on Top (1970)Proof that the Godfather’s albums were more than just addendums to his hits. Soul on Top is, if not a concept album, then certainly a conceptual one: an unexpected set of jazzy R&B recorded with Louie Bellson’s big band. Amazingly, it works – even the swing take on For Once in My Life, also recorded by Stevie Wonder a few years prior.8. There It Is (1972)When Brown began slowing down the rate at which he released albums, it led to an increase in their quality – here, even the evidently improvised slow-motion closer Never Can Say Goodbye is compellingly haunting. Point docked for includingtwospoken-word warnings about drugs – the sombre King Heroin and Public Enemy Number One, the two parts of which go on for what feels likemonths.7. It’s a Mother (1969)The tracklist suggests a hurried dance-craze cash-in; five songs have “popcorn” in the title. It might well have been recorded in a rush, but that works in It’s a Mother’s favour. A couple of ballads aside, the album feels like one ferocious extended jam, improvised on the spot, Brown barking orders to the musicians as much as singing.6. Revolution of the Mind: Live at the Apollo, Volume III (1971)Tom Waits described seeing Brown live as “like putting your finger in a light socket”, which fits the music here: the handbrake turns of the “fast medley” (three songs in 80 seconds!); the ferocious succession of tracks on side 4. And hats off for his rant against dieting: “The more you got, the more I want.”5. Say It Loud – I’m Black and I’m Proud (1969)As the 60s ended, Brown seemed to finally grasp that an album was more than a random collection of tracks. The title number is the draw here, but there’s a real flow to the rest. The ballads and instrumentals are too good to count as padding, and the slinky groove of Licking Stick – Licking Stick is obviously irresistible.View image in fullscreenGet thee behind me.Photograph: David Lichtneker/Alamy4. Hell (1974)At this point, Brown had started billing himself as the Minister of New New Super Heavy Funk. The Hell album’s My Thang reveals he wasn’t exaggerating. An abysmal, inexplicable cover of When the Saints Go Marching In aside, it’s all fantastic – plus the cartoon sleeve features Brown wrestling Satan and winning.3. Sex Machine (1970)Sex Machine saw Brown’s band, the JBs, at the height of their powers, supposedly captured live. Over half of the album patentlyisn’tlive, but given how awesome the extended takes of the title track and Mother Popcorn are – not to mention the thrillingly improbable transition from a version of If I Ruled the World into a warp-speed There Was a Time – is anyone really bothered?2. Live at the Apollo (1963)Brown’s label was dismissive of his idea for a live album, so the singer had to fund its recording himself. The result was an atmospheric, electrifying document of classic Chitlin’ Circuit soul, both raw and incredibly tight: a relentless, no-pauses barrage of songs, strafed with the audience’s screams and cries.1. The Payback (1973)Brown’s career was about to take a commercial dive, but you’d never guess from The Payback; nor would you guess that it was a rejected film soundtrack repurposed as a standalone double album that’s completely cohesive and immensely powerful. At least part of that power and cohesion comes from a shift in tone. In the midst of Watergate and a deepening recession, Brown’s messages of empowerment now seem underpinned by a noticeable impatience and anger. The softer songs have a bleak, despairing tone, suggesting that, whatever Forever Suffering and Doing the Best I Can present themselves as, they’re not necessarily just about affairs of the heart.Explore more on these topicsRankedJames BrownSoulfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The play follows Miriam, played by Ibraheem, a young mother training to survive an Israeli bombing in Gaza.“A quarter of a mile,” someone replies.Miriam meditates for a beat. “That’s really slow, you know,” she says as the audience laughs.A Knock on the Roof is a blunt and poignant work, named after the Israeli military’s practice of “roof knocking”, in which residents are notified by a warning bomb that they have just five to 15 minutes to evacuate before a larger missile flattens their homes. The play, which opened on Monday at theNew YorkTheatre Workshop (NYTW) as part of the Under the Radar festival, brims with love, wry humor and grief as it follows Miriam’s obsessive training to leave her home. It will show in New York until 16 February before transferring to the Royal Court theatre in London, for performances from 21 February to 8 March.In the 85-minute show, Miriam sets a series of five-minute timers and rehearses how she, her son and her elderly mother will flee from their seventh-floor apartment after the “roof knock”: down the stairs, as the elevator will be out of order; past Yasmeen, her know-it-all neighbor on the third floor; over the loose floor tile in the stairwell; and, finally, out the door.View image in fullscreen‘A Knock on the Roof is a blunt and poignant work, named after the Israeli military’s practice of “roof knocking”.’Photograph: Joan MarcusAlong with the anxiety of the impending roof knock, the solo show includes other details about Miriam’s life under Israeli occupation, including how she raises her young son while her husband studies abroad. For instance, she spends long stretches of time waiting for the electricity to be restored, which Miriam comments on as she monologues about the other frustrations of her day. The shelled-out buildings in her neighborhood are rendered via eerie projections, juxtaposed with colorful umbrellas and an expansive beach.These specifics aren’t written voyeuristically. They’re simply facts of Miriam’s life, just like Miriam’s expansive facial routine or her nosy mother or her adorable but stubborn six-year-old son. “We don’t get the story of those people that survived this war [and] their experience,” Ibraheem told the Guardian. “And about the fact that during wartime, you can also do laundry or laugh with your mother and son, or you need to do daily things to survive.”Miriam, a fictional character, is a culmination of Ibraheem’s research, dozens of conversations with people from Gaza and others who have experienced war, and dashes of Ibraheem’s own life to fill in differences between the two. Miriam “is a fighter. She’s strong. Not only in terms of a war,” said Ibraheem. She is “basically a single mother raising a child in an impossible place alone, and she’s making the best out of it”. Miriam and Ibraheem overlap in significant ways: their proclivity towards sarcasm and their experience with war. “I come from a place where war has recently become a state of mind,” said Ibraheem, who’s Syrian and lives in the Israeli-occupied, annexed Golan Heights.Though she hasn’t experienced a “roof knock”, which mainly happens in Gaza, Ibraheem felt compelled to write about the subject, as she empathized with people “paying the price of a war [they’re] not a part of”, Ibraheem said, calling Golan Heights’ situation a “soft occupation”. “I never saw a tank in the state of the Golan Heights. I never needed to run from a soldier,” she said. But, farmers in the Golan Heights struggle with the cost of water and maintaining the land, while Israeli settlers enjoy such privileges for free. Residents of Golan Heights cannot enter Syria due to border restrictions, but they can visit Palestine. “This is like a historical coincidence that I’m in touch with the Palestinian people,” Ibraheem said.View image in fullscreenThe play brims with love, wry humor and grief.Photograph: Joan MarcusStill, Ibraheem and her community have experienced the violence of war. On 27 July 2023, 12 childrenwere killedby a rocket while playing on a football field in Majdal Shams. “When a rocket lands, [it] does not know how it’s killing and why it’s killing,” she said of the tragic event. “We experienced the loss of the war between Israel and Hezbollah, although we are not part of [that] war.”Ibraheem first conceived of A Knock on the Roof in 2014 after reading an article about people in Gaza packing preparation bags in case of missile strikes. Inspired, she wrote a 10-minute monologue, called “what does it do to you when you know that in five to 15 minutes your house will be gone”, Ibraheem said. In 2021, Ibraheem and the director Oliver Butler further developed the excerpt into a full-length play, using Miriam’s evacuation drills as the through-line. “What I saw was just a really clear engine for a story and the beginnings of a character who might become consumed with preparation,” said Butler of Ibraheem’s early idea. The fact that the play remains relevant more than 10 years later is “terrifying”, said Ibraheem.Ibraheem and Butler, who called Ibraheem a “theater soulmate”, have remained in close collaboration after first meeting in 2019 at the now defunct SundanceTheatreLab in Park City, Utah. Ibraheem was developing a comedy called London Jenin in collaboration with the Freedom Theatre, a Palestinian community theater in the Jenin refugee camp. The play focuses on two Palestinians in a UK immigration office practicing their entrance interviews while debating on relocating to London versus remaining in their homeland. Ibraheem’s work, Butler said, often includes themes of “trappedness, freedom and rehearsal”.If you want to know how free a society is, look at what’s happening in its theatres | Arifa AkbarRead moreIn May 2023, Butler, who is from Connecticut and lives in New York, visited Ibraheem in Golan Heights to continue working on A Knock on the Roof. The trip proved a “creative dream” but a “massive education”, Butler said. When he first arrived, seven people in Gaza were killed by an Israeli rocket, putting the entire region “on the verge of war”. Performing a reading of A Knock on the Roof in Ramallah, located in the West Bank, exposed Butler firsthand to checkpoints. An avid hiker, he was walking up a mountain when he came across a menacing sign, which read: “Go no further. Landmines [ahead].” “What feels like such a safe, beautiful place full of family and art also has minefields all around,” he said.The play almost didn’t happen several times due to safety concerns in the region, said Ibraheem. “Flights are canceled and war is happening,” she said. “Suddenly, the safety of being in a theater stopped being so taken for granted.”With the show now making its US premiere at NYTW, Ibraheem and Butler say that audiences have generally received the show positively. But some people have complained, claiming that the show is antisemitic because it features a Palestinian protagonist. “Are we saying that the existence of a character who’s Palestinian is dangerous or offensive?” said Butler. “If a character can’t exist on stage like this, then you’re saying that that person should not be allowed to exist.”Patricia McGregor, the NYTW artistic director, said the theater had caught flak for debuting A Knock on the Roof. “I remember seeing somebody [online] saying: ‘Oh, you’re doing this antisemitic play,’” McGregor said. “And I think that assumption [comes from] doing a play that centers a mother in Gaza, living her life and trying to make sure her child survives, an assumption which is just not true.”NYTW has a longstanding, although imperfect, relationship with Palestinian artwork and artists. Noor Theatre, which supports Middle Eastern artists, is an NYTW company-in-residence, and in 2012, NYTW put on the group’s Food and Fadwa, a dramedy about a Palestinian family living near Bethlehem.In December 2024, the playwright Victor I Cazares,a former NYTW artist-in-residence, launched an HIV-medicine strike after the theater did not call for a ceasefire; the protest caused a storm of controversy, with criticism lodged both at NYTW and Cazares. “I think there was an unfortunate avalanche of feelings and assumptions about what political alignment was happening,” said McGregor. “There were differing opinions about what strategies we use to try to get people to pay attention and to change hearts and minds.” Programming artwork like Ibraheem’s, McGregor said, was among the most effective things a theater can do to spark conversations and reach across divides.For Ibraheem, A Knock on the Roof provides a rare opportunity to capture the intimacy of wartime alongside the everyday emotions: fear, irritation, joy. One of the most magical moments, she said, was when audiences laugh with Miriam and her attempts to juggle it all. “I don’t want people to sit in on the play and be in solidarity with me,” she said. “I want them to sit there and to be with me, and once they laugh, I feel that they are with me.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreNew YorkIsrael-Gaza warRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I prefer his whisky adsYes he’s about to be Red Hulk in Captain America: Brave New World, but a YouTube series featuring the Hollywood star being grumpy in Scotland is the best thing he’s done for yearsStuart HeritageThu 30 Jan 2025 06.16 ESTLast modified on Thu 30 Jan 2025 06.31 ESTShareIn the next few weeks,Harrison Fordwill officially join the Marvel Cinematic Universe, starring in Captain America: Brave New World as both the president of the United States and Red Hulk. However, the film is shaping up to be a critical and commercial flop – maybe even the biggest Marvel flop yet – and so it makes sense that Ford would want to quickly move on to his next project.And now we know what that project is. This week a number of videos appeared on the YouTube channel of the Scottish whisky brand Glenmorangie, taking the form of a semi-fictional six-part series about the adventures of Harrison Ford in Scotland. Joel Edgerton directed the adverts. They’re set in the Traitors castle. It’s all quite hard to comprehend.Of course, this isn’t the first time that a Hollywood star has gone abroad to make money in adverts. Nicolas Cage went to Japan and made a series of incomprehensiblepachinko commercials, while more recentlyRobert De Niro cameto the UK to become the face of sliced bread. Perhaps the most similar to this are the series of blockbuster tourism commercials thatZac Efron and Jessica Albamade for Dubai, which took the form of compressed action movie trailers filmed across a number of famous local landmarks.But even this doesn’t quite match up to the sheer weirdness of what Ford has done here. Anyone could just go to Scotland and sip some booze, but this is almost a soap opera. In episode one, Ford paces about his bedroom having seen a vision of Scotland while meditating, anddemands to be taken to a castle. In the second he arrives in Scotland, visits theGlenmorangie distilleryand immediately starts telling people that he won’t do adverts, until they give him a nice car, and then he changes his mind.Episode three sees Ford visit hisaccommodation, which is very clearly the castle where they film The Traitors, and he goes to the Round Table room and breaks a suit of armour. Episode four heputs on a kilt. Episode five he goesback to the distilleryand does a genuinely upsetting Scottish accent to a Scottish person. In episode six, he drinks some whisky and then throws theadvert’s script in the fire.And then that’s it. Maybe. It’s honestly hard to tell since, because the series doesn’t really have anything approaching an identifiable narrative, Ford throwing the script in the fire could be the end, but it could just as equally be another ambient punctuation point on a story that will play out for ever. There’s a compressed version of the series that plays out as a traditional 60-second advert. That has a shot of Ford on a glen in a kilt surrounded by bagpipers. Could this have been taken from a later episode? Is that going to end up being the story, of Harrison Ford becoming more and more cartoonishly Scottish until he ends up looking and acting likeRuss Abbotfrom the 1980s?I do sort of want Ford to keep making these adverts for ever, though. There’s something weirdly melancholy about them. They’re about an older man in a foreign country, a bit bemused and seemingly in the grip of an existential crisis. In that regard they’re a bit like Michael Winterbottom’s The Trip, only with fewer impressions. Who knows where it could go from here. Maybe he’ll find love, and the whole thing will become a kind of whisky-based Gold Blend campaign. Maybe he’ll stay in the castle so long that he’ll end up on the next series of The Traitors. Maybe he’ll hulk out. There’s really no telling.It’s an interesting way for the latter stages of a career to play out. Harrison Ford is an icon, a man destined to go down as one of the all-time great film actors. And yet here he is, 82 years old and farting around on YouTube for a relatively small audience, seemingly just to entertain himself.It reminds me a little of David Lynch who, after spending years at the forefront of arthouse cinema, spent his latter years happily messing about on the internet. The last piece of work Lynch ever produced is a video on his channel, where he took an old film and dida funny voiceover about buttson top of it. He was happy doing it, so we should be happy it exists. Same goes for Harrison Ford. Forget the MCU, if he wants to spend the rest of his life dithering about in Scotland, none of us should stop him.Explore more on these topicsFilmHarrison FordMarvelSuperhero moviesAction and adventure filmsAdvertisingWhiskyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Welcome to the Toy Fair, in London’s Kensington Olympia, the UK’s biggest bonanza of toys, games and hobbies, where the world’s manufacturers converge to peddle their latest wares, as retailers scour the endless stands for the hottest new trends. It’s a mind-boggling place of plushies and puzzles, remote-control cars and mud kitchens, and more plastic than you would find at a petrochemical convention. Here, the £3.4bn business of fun is taken very seriously indeed, with NDAs galore and not a child in sight. So where is the toy world heading in 2025?Fear not – there’s a Captain Planet figurine who promises to ‘repair the damage done to the Earth!’“We’re seeing a real boom in micro collectibles,” says Kerri Atherton, head of public affairs at the British Toy & Hobby Association, which organises the fair, now in its 71st year. “They have all of the cuteness without the big price tag, and they’re also popular with adults, who like to display them rather than play with them.”Browsing the 250 stands feels like hopping between Lilliput and Brobdingnag. On the one hand, you encounter super-sized toy characters at every turn: Fireman Sam gives a cheery beam, a permanent smile frozen on his fuzzy felt face;a cyclopian red Numberblockis told by its minder to wave nicely. But the toys themselves, which are seductively arranged on the stands like jars in a sweetshop window, are getting smaller and smaller, as manufacturers capitalise on the current trend for teeny collectibles. It’s a symptom of both customers’ reduced spending power and their lack of storage space, along with the ever-growing lust for all thingskawaii.View image in fullscreenTiny collectibles … Lego Dungeons and Dragons minifigures.Photograph: Courtesy of LEGO“People just love the fact they’re so bitty,” says Jeff van Rens from Funko, a US brand that makes phenomenally popular vinyl figurines calledPops, with cartoonishly square, oversized heads. He ushers me into their booth where, along with shelves groaning with their staple cast of 10cm-tall plastic characters, themed around everything from Star Wars to Stranger Things, there are racks ofBitty Pops– miniature versions of the same characters, standing just over 2cm high. Barely big enough to have facial features beyond two giant doe eyes, they look very easy to lose down the back of the sofa.“In today’s world, space can often be a consideration with collecting,” says Van Rens. “You could have two Funko Pops, or the entire collection of DC Bitty Pops, taking up about the same amount of space.” He gestures to a shelf where an itty-bitty Batman stands next to an equally diminutive Joker, each sealed in a tiny acrylic box. They are sold in packs of four for £10 (compared with a single Pop for around £13), and there’s a clever marketing ruse: one of the four is a mystery character, opening up a lucrative realm of duplicates.Graduated levels of rarity mean that devoted “Funko completists” are spurred on to buy evermore packs in the hope of completing the set. It’s hard not to wince at the sheer amount ofPVCon display – one of the most toxic plastics to produce and dispose of – especially afterFunko was accused of throwing $30m of excess stock in landfill(a practice not uncommon in the toy industry). But fear not, its range includesa Captain Planet figurine, “to repair the damage done to the Earth!”Theblind box trend, as buying surprise toys in opaque packaging is known, has exploded in recent years, with a global market value of around £11bn. Stores such as Pop Mart and Miniso have boomed in popularity, particularly with the “kidult” market – the over 12s, who now account for almost £1 in every £3 spent on toys. Crowds of teens and young adults can be found queueing for the latest blind box releases, while the stores are full of people holding the boxes up to their ears and shaking them, hoping to divine what’s inside.“The lucky dip element has always been a popular play pattern,” says Adam White, brand manager at Character Options, distributor of major toy brands such as Teletubbies, Doctor Who and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. “Just think of collecting football stickers.” But he says the lust for surprise has been supercharged in recent years by the surge ofunboxing videoson social media, in which fans breathlessly open their mystery boxes to rapt audiences online.View image in fullscreenFuzzy friends … the toy character parade that opens the fair.Photograph: Imageplotter/AlamyHe shows me one of their latest toy ranges, calledTerror Fried. “It’s based on what happens when fast food goes wrong,” he says. “Maybe a mouse or a cockroach falls into the deep fat fryer.” This year’s collection, Stir-fry Surprise, will take the form of a mutant Chinese takeaway. He picks up a spring roll and crushes it in his hand, causing gelatinous slime to ooze between his fingers. There’s a collectible creepy-crawly lurking in the slime, one of many mystery critters with different degrees of rarity, awaiting inside bowls of noodle soup, fortune cookies and sushi rolls.“We delivered these to influencers in brown paper bags, just like a takeaway,” says White. “Opening the mystery packages is very popular on YouTube and TikTok,” he adds, peer-to-peer marketing in the toy sector now being much more effective than conventional advertising. Indeed, the fair even has a dedicated “child influencer day”, the only time children are allowed into this adult-only funfair, as long as they have a performer’s licence.The influencers tend to flock to toys linked to popular TV programmes and films – this year Lilo & Stitch, Bluey, Sonic and Wicked are particular favourites – with licensed products bigger than ever, making up 35% of the total toy market. Sylvanian Families hopes to capitalise on its 40th anniversary year, with a movie coming out in April, while an unexpected hit has come from one of the stranger corners of the internet, in the form ofSkibidi Toilet– a surreal animated YouTube series about possessed toilets going to war with besuited humanoid characters with TVs for heads. A Toilet Mystery Surprise can be yours for £49.99. (“6yr old grandson thought it was the best present,” says one review. “I thought personally it was not great value for money.”) As Atherton says: “You just can’t predict what kids are going to like.”View image in fullscreenWear your fandom… Squishmallows FigBands.Photograph: JazwaresFor all the novelty on show, the biggest overall takeaway of the fair is actually how simple the most popular toys continue to be. You might have expected the tech industry to have extended its tentacles deeper into the realm of play by now, with AI-powered chat bears spouting GPT-generated gobbledegook, but the overriding trend is back to basics. For the second year running, the bestselling toy in the UK was an £8 cushion with a face. The 20cm-highSquishmallowdefies all expectations of innovation, being an egg-shaped stuffed toy with no discernible USP. But timing, in the toy world, is everything.Touted as gen alpha’s version of Beanie Babies, Squishmallows’ ultra-soft, cushion-like quality profited from the global hunger for comforting hugs and cuddles in the pandemic, while their cosy popularity was further fuelled by endorsements on social media from celebrity devotees like Kim Kardashian and Lady Gaga. The hype even prompted Warren Buffett to buy the company in 2022 – an event marked by the release ofa plushie version of the billionaire investor.The cute cushions take the form of animals vegetables, and strange hybrids of both, and each comes with its own little biography, encouraging fans to collect a whole cast of oddball characters they might identify with. Meet Malcolm, a football-mad mushroom, or Floyd, a pack of french fries who enjoys sailing. Jumping on the micro mystery bandwagon, the company recently launchedFigBands, smaller versions of Squishmallows. Sold blind, they can be displayed, worn, or attached to bags, “letting you flaunt your fandom wherever you go!”Disrupting the Lego Group’s longstanding primacy, Squishmallow’s manufacturer, Jazwares, boasted the most prominent and highest security stand of the whole fair. It was surrounded by high walls, guarded by an army of reps, and viewable by appointment only, with visits subject to binding non-disclosure agreements. The lucrative future of cuddly cushions remains a closely guarded secret.Explore more on these topicsCultureToysRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is burning the seed corn,” she added. “They should be opening more libraries.”Barr, the author of the award-winning memoirMaggie & Me, said: “Every library that closes is a dark day for that community and for our country. They are engines of social mobility and community cohesion.Jack Reacher would not exist without Birmingham’s libraries, says writerRead more“Libraries are like the NHS: they should be ringfenced, they should be protected in perpetuity, because we understand that their value is not just on the day that somebody goes, their value is for ever when you open a book and you learn something about yourself or about the world.”The National Library of Scotland, one of the UK’s four statutory book depositories, is launching its “love libraries” campaign on Valentine’s Day to help mark the centenary of its foundation in central Edinburgh in 1925.Campaigners have been alarmed by a steep increase in councils identifying libraries for possible closure in recent months, after a decade of incremental closures and service cuts that heavily affected school libraries.Information requests have established that 42 public libraries have already closed in Scotland since 2014, with overall staffing cut by 25% and library funding reduced by 30%, despite a statutory requirement on Scottish councils to protect services.About a third of school librarian posts, which are not protected by law, have also been cut in the last decade. Some councils are proposing mobile or virtual libraries instead, or asking for volunteers to run public facilities.Sean McNamara, the director of the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals in Scotland, said this raised serious questions about whether the Scottish government was properly enforcing the statutory protections for libraries.McNamara said a meeting earlier this week between Angus Robertson, the Scottish government’s culture secretary, and council representatives to discuss libraries and cultural policy was welcome, but specific action and funding was needed.“The cuts that are happening at the moment could be really, really damaging,” he said. “Library numbers have recovered since Covid but people need their libraries there. They need staff in them that can provide the services to support their reading, to support their digital inclusion, to reduce social isolation. If they’re ripped out, then the heart of those communities is gone.”Robertson has come under pressure at Holyrood from the Scottish Green party MSP Mark Ruskell to intervene more directly and review the statutory duty to provide public libraries.The culture secretary confirmed on Thursday he would look at “any measures” that would help protect library provision and access. He said it would “grieve me greatly” if libraries were to close.“As Scotland’s culture secretary, it matters greatly to me that people right across the country have access to libraries,” Robertson said.Robertson said he wanted to see a close partnership with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the umbrella body for Scotland’s 32 councils which he met earlier this week.Scottish councils and cultural bodies have been given more money in the new budget, with a previous ban on council tax rises scrapped this year. A record number of arts and cultural organisations have also received funding fromCreative Scotland.“Both of us are agreed that we want to do everything that we can to promote and support culture and the network of cultural organisations and cultural venues and libraries right across Scotland,” Robertson said.This article was amended on 30 January 2025. The library frequented by a young Val McDermid was in Kirkcaldy, not Kilmarnock as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsLibrariesScotlandVal McDermidInequalitySocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

Smith, 78, was performing with the Berlin groupSoundwalk Collective, in which she recites her writing to a musical backing.Associated Press reported that the newspaper Folha de S Paulo said that Smith passed out about 30 minutes into the event while reading a piece about the climate crisis. After falling, she was taken backstage in a wheelchair.Smith returned to the stage to apologise for having to cut the performance short. “Unfortunately, I got sick, and the doctor said I can’t finish,” she told the crowd from the wheelchair. “So we will have to figure something out. And I feel very badly.”The crowd responded: “Don’t be, we love you.”Posting on Instagram, the collective said that despite her migraine, Smith “still wanted to be there for all of us and you and perform today” – Wednesday, the final date of a run of South American tour dates.“She is now being cared for by the best doctors in the most loving way and will be back on stage tomorrow night [Thursday],” the collective said.Smith also signed the statement, which continued: “Patti says that she is tremendously grateful for your patience and forgiveness and she sends her love to all who attended.”In March, artists including Michael Stipe, Kim Gordon, Karen O of Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Chrissie Hynde and Susanna Hoffs of the Bangles will perform ata tribute concertmarking 50 years of Smith’s canonical punk album Horses.They asked fans to “refrain from posing [footage] at this sensitive moment”. Nevertheless, videos posted online showed Smith lying on the ground at the Cultura Artística theatre.Patti Smith and Soundwalk Collective have collaborated on several albums since 2016, the most recent of which,The Perfect Vision: Reworkings, was released in 2022. Smith’s last solo album wasBanga, released in 2012. In the meantime, she has written several acclaimed books, includingM TrainandYear of the Monkey.In December 2023, she was briefly hospitalised in Italy for a “sudden illness”. In 2020, shetold the Guardianthat she had struggled during the pandemic owing to a lifelong bronchial condition that kept her indoors. “To be in limbo almost 10 months, for a person like me who doesn’t like sitting in the same place, it’s been very challenging,” she said. “I feel like I’m part-wolf, roaming from room to room.”Explore more on these topicsPatti SmithBrazilPunkAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The star of 1980s US soap Dynasty began her big-screen career in films such as Howard Hawks’ 1955 mega-flop Land of the Pharaohs as well as in The Opposite Sex (1956) and The Wayward Bus (1957).Her biggest hits were in late 70s hits The Stud and The Bitch but Collins continued to work through the decades, most notably this century replacing Elizabeth Taylor as Pearl Slaghoople, Wilma’s mother, in The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, and opposite Taylor, Debbie Reynolds and Shirley MacLaine in TV film These Old Broads (2001).Joan Collins on love, loss and lust at 90: ‘You have to eat life or life will eat you!’Read moreSaid Collins: “I am thrilled about the challenge of playing this iconic woman in a previously untold story.”The decision in 1936 by Edward VIII to marry Simpson, who was twice divorced, triggered a constitutional crisis that led to Edward’s abdication and the throne being taken by his younger brother, George VI, the grandfather of current monarch Charles III.Edward and Wallis spent much of the rest of their lives after the second world war in semi-exile in France, after their 1937 tour of Nazi Germany led many to conclude they were Hitler sympathisers. Edward died in 1972, after which she became increasingly frail.She developed dementia, broke her hip twice and became a recluse, supported largely by an allowance from Queen Elizabeth II. Her French lawyer, Suzanne Blum, assumed power of attorney, and sold items belonging to the Duchess to her own friends at below market value. Biographers have since accused Blum of exploiting her client.In 1980, Simpson lost the ability to speak and towards the end of her life was unable leave her bed or receive any visitors. Simpson said of her life after her third marriage: “You have no idea how hard it is to live out a great romance.”Speaking to the Guardian in 2023, Collins said the script had been written for her. “It’s the true story of the last years of the Duchess of Windsor after the Duke dies. She was abused by this woman who took her over and took away her objects, her money, and left her practically destitute.“You see her first of all when she’s full of pep and she’s got her young acolytes around her, then bit by bit she is destroyed by circumstances. It’s a very good script and it’s a great part for me. I’ve always been fascinated by Wallis, because I think she was unfairly treated.”Simpson has previously been played by Lia Williams in The Crown, Joely Richardson in Wallis & Edward, Faye Dunaway in The Woman I Love, and Eve Best in The King’s Speech. Andrea Riseborough took the role in Madonna’s film W.Collins is a vocal supporter of the British monarchy and was made a dame in 2015.Explore more on these topicsFilmJoan CollinsMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

Russell Brand left the BBC in 2008 following a high-profile editorial breach.”The broadcaster also said it was “clear presenters have been able to abuse their positions at the BBC in the past” and that a number of steps had been introduced since 2008 to deal with serious allegations.The review investigated a complaint made by a woman working in the same building as the BBC’s office in Los Angeles, in which she claimed Brand exposed himself to her in 2008, and later laughed about the encounter on his radio show.Another allegation looked at a claim made by a woman called “Alice”, who alleged BBC cars transported her, including from her school to his house, when she was 16 and alleged to be in a relationship with Brand.In November, the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed it was considering bringing charges against Brand.The Met police have said they received reports of sexual offences from women in London and elsewhere in the country after the Times investigation.A man in his 40s was interviewed by officers under cautionin relation to the allegations, the force said at the time.Philippa Childs, the head of the broadcasting union Bectu, said: “The BBC’s acknowledgement that Brand was perceived as too influential for staff to complain about and that some presenters had been able to abuse their positions, is deeply troubling.“It’s critical that people feel safe to raise concerns at work, especially in a sector where power imbalances are particularly extreme.”The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, said:“The complaints against Russell Brand set out in this report are horrendous. As is the fact that staff felt unable to raise concerns because they did not think that they would be believed or taken seriously.”She added: “For too long, there has been a culture of silence in the media industry where inappropriate behaviour like Brand’s has been tolerated or downplayed. Power imbalances and a perception that certain stars cannot be challenged are sadly not unique to this case.“The BBC, and the wider industry, must now urgently consider what more they can do to make sure that abuse and harassment by anyone, no matter who they are, is not tolerated in any of their workplaces.”A Downing Street spokesperson said Nandy was “seeking assurances” from the BBC that it had robust processes in place regarding non-editorial complaints.Asked about the prime minister’s reaction, the spokesperson said: “The complaints against Russell Brand are horrendous. The PM’s thoughts are with all those affected and he commends those who bravely came forward to share their experiences.“As the culture secretary has said, it is essential that staff and the wider public has confidence that the BBC takes these issues seriously, and that is why they should now reflect on the findings of the report and complete their wider review of workplace culture to ensure this can never happen again.”Explore more on these topicsRussell BrandBBCTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

They include properties as significant as Ranger’s House in Greenwich, London, a Georgian villa with an important art collection, where part of Netflix’s popular television series Bridgerton was filmed.A further 21 sites will be closed for winter. They include Lullingstone Roman Villa in Kent, begun in about AD100 and among the most outstanding examples in Britain; Totnes Castle in Devon, built 900 years ago during the Norman conquest, almost certainly by one of William the Conqueror’s commanders; and Furness Abbey in Cumbria, once the largest monastery in north-west England, founded in the 12th century.“This is seriously worrying,” one insider said.There are also fears for the demise of irreplaceable experience as experts could be made redundant or have some of their responsibilities handed over to a new layer of managers.One insider said staff were dismayed and that a colleague was in tears after last week’s meeting about the organisation’s “reshaping”. “All of our jobs are basically at risk. They won’t tell us an exact number, but it’s affecting virtually every department. Sacking so many people is unbelievable.”Another source said: “We think we are talking 150 full-time equivalent redundancies – potentially up to 200 actual people.”EnglishHeritagecares for more than 400 historic monuments, buildings and places. The charity no longer receives a government grant, relying instead on membership, tickets and sales in its shops and cafes. It has 2,535 employees and more than 5,000 volunteers.Staff understand that the new structure will be in place in April.A source said among those invited to the meeting were three London curators who are on maternity leave: “ Basically, the whole thing has just been handled so badly.”Curators fear that responsibilities for “collection management” and “interpretation” – will be transferred to younger – and cheaper – “collection managers” brought in to oversee them.A source said: “That means getting rid of people who are extremely skilled, but who would require more money. Adding a new team of managers is going to add to the bureaucracy, layers of managers who are not necessarily art experts. I believe in giving young people opportunities, but they’ll basically just employ people with absolutely no skills to fill these gaps and pay them probably peanuts. It’s not right.”Prospect and the PCS, the unions that represent the heritage sector, are concerned.Steve Thomas, Prospect’s deputy general secretary, said: “Staff at English Heritage will be understandably worried about their future after hearing this news and worried about the future of the historic sites they work so hard to keep open to the public.“We have been working with the employer to minimise redundancies … We recognise that the financial situation is difficult. But it is also true that the skilled and dedicated staff who keep our history alive are the very heart of this organisation. Losing these skills and this experience would damage our heritage as much as losing the sites themselves.”Fran Heathcote, the PCS’s general secretary, said: “We stand committed to protecting the jobs and livelihoods of our members … [who play] a key role in the vital task of preserving English history.”An English Heritage spokesperson said: “All organisations need to review their structure from time to time and English Heritage has not done so for several years. In that time, our world has changed dramatically. The pandemic and its aftermath led to lasting changes in visitor expectations and behaviour, both domestically and internationally, while many of our visitors and members are facing challenges with the cost of living.“High inflation has increased the cost of conservation work at our sites, but significant and ongoing expenditure is still required if the condition of the sites in our care is not to deteriorate.“The aim of these proposals is to ensure that English Heritage is financially resilient and can fulfil our charitable purposes . We’re committed to working with our employees and our trade unions to find ways to avoid and reduce redundancies where we can … Under these proposals, we will continue to have a team of more than 75 expert curators, historians and conservators.”He added that to exclude those on maternity leave from consultation would be unlawful.He argued that a reduction in opening hours would affect “a relatively small number” of sites, some of which attract few visitors during the winter months: “For instance over one weekend in November, a number of these sites only welcomed 11 visitors.”He added that 22 of the other smaller sites would have special guided tours and temporary exhibitions to “provide a richer experience than what we currently offer”.Nothing will be confirmed until after a formal consultation period.Explore more on these topicsEnglish HeritageHeritageRedundancyArts fundingShareReuse this content"

It’s a Friday night in Cardiff and Lottie (also played by Jarman) is seeking her own form of salvation, be it through impromptu hotel Tinder hook-ups or trauma-bonding over lines of coke in nightclub toilets. As a portrait of grief and the prejudices experienced by disabled people, this is an assured and impassioned playwriting debut.View image in fullscreenDarkly adult … Mared Jarman and Paul Davies in Byth Bythoedd Amen.Photograph: Theatr Cymru/Jorge LizaldeJarman’s performance is equally fearless. Unapologetic depictions of female sexuality remain relatively rare in Welsh-language theatre, and for the play to also foreground the desires of a blind character feels innovative and overdue. Paul Davies as Lottie’s best friend Bennie – as well as a slew of additional roles – is superb. We hear much about Bennie before he eventually appears onstage, and Davies’ expressive, smiling face seems to confirm an entire loving lifetime within a single expression.Designed by Livia Jones, the traverse street scene is redolent of a child’s play mat, contrasting with the gaudy neon pink that invites Lottie on to the sticky dancefloor of the Clam Shack. Garrin Clarke’s lighting is particularly arresting in its fluid shaping of space. Rhian Blythe’s taut direction sustains a production (for Theatr Cymru) that is unafraid of leaning into a heightened theatricality, even as it veers close to camp and despite the content often being somewhat grim.The drama seeks to straddle two worlds: destructive youthful abandon and the desire for placid maturity, the provocative and the sincere, light and dark, life and death. Some of the necessary tonal shifts are more disorientating and irreconcilable than others. Frequently, the play is strongest when emulating a darkly confessional standup routine where self-deprecation is wielded as a deflective shield. Alongside the script’s flippant quips about the aftertaste of semen are vicious descriptions of assault and of brutal ableist slurs whose violence is left hanging in the air.AtSherman theatre, Cardiff, until 31 January.

The family in question are the Stauffers – married couple Myka and James and their children – who were, until very recently, colossally successful family vloggers.Director Rachel Mason’s series starts slowly, spending most of the first hour introducing the uninitiated to the world of YouTubers who specialise in filling their channels with videos of their gorgeous homes, gorgeous children and perfect lives, and to the fans who glom on to these affectless yet somehow intimate and generally wildly aspirational portraits of domestic bliss. “I was literally a part of their life every day,” says former devotee Hannah Cho. She and around 700,000 subscribers to The Stauffer Life channel watched as Myka revealed positive pregnancy tests, had babies, a miscarriage, gave house cleaning tips, appraisals of her post-partum body and altogether so much desirable content that she began to accumulate sponsorship deals and the family’s videos became the family’s (very) lucrative business.An Update on Our Family: the utterly shocking tale of the ‘family vloggers’ who ‘rehomed’ their adopted sonRead moreThis set-up could and should have been whipped through in half the time. The real meat of the documentary is what happens when you need to keep feeding the beast you have created. When your incomedepends on monetising your family, where does that lead? And can it possibly be anywhere good?Engagement with their channel goes through the roof when the Stauffers decide to adopt a three-year-old boy with special needs from China, whom they call Huxley. Myka has the name picked before she meets him, though no one around her seems to note that renaming a three-year-old child, and especially one with special needs, from a different culture, who is about to be yanked from it, is an extraordinary thing to do. But on they went, exhaustively documenting the process, including the first disastrous meeting with Huxley. Or “Huxley”. It dawns on a tearful James that the boy “had a full-blown mom” in his foster carer. “Poor kid,” he whispers.The determinedly cheerful journey back to America is filmed and packaged for their waiting, avaricious online audience. The demand for updates thereafter is insatiable, and for a couple of years they keep coming, including ones about the behavioural issues caused by Huxley’s autism and at least one from Myka noting that “he grieved so hard” and that she was “unprepared for what trauma truly looked like”. Then Huxley disappears from the family videos. Then previous videos containing him are deleted. Subscribers bombard the channel with questions. In 2020, the Stauffers posted a tearful video entitled An Update on OurFamilyexplaining that though they love him with all their hearts, Huxley has had to be placed with a different “forever family” better able to cope with his needs, the extent of which they had not fully understood at the time he was adopted.Their subscribers, and then – when the story went viral – the rest of the internet, took this news about as well as you would expect. A small amount of compassion was swamped by horror and disgust, by insults, anger, vitriol (directed mostly at Myka as a foul perversion of the maternal instinct), then death threats, then raging conspiracy theories that the Stauffers had sold him, killed him and God knows what else.Mason’s film raises questions about just about every compelling issue of the internet age. It looks at the ethics of parents filming children who cannot give consent and who would in any professional, paid context be subject to myriad safeguarding regulations. It looks at the parasocial relationships that develop between content creators and followers, and the dangers of “betraying” those attachments. It poses questions about the purity of creators’ motives, and when a line is crossed between the natural human impulse to share, even show off, the good things in one’s life and the need to curate an impossible perfection, especially once it becomes sponsored by rich brands. It looks at the optimism, arrogance and entitlement that can play a part in transnational adoptions. And it looks at those who jump on to an emotional bandwagon not because they were invested in the original story but because they are malevolent trolls dedicated to spitting into open wounds wherever they find them.The Stauffers refused to be involved with the film and their family channel has been offline since the backlash became uncontainable. So we will probably never know how many of their actions were driven by the greed for clicks, or whether it was simple benevolence throughout. But it is hard not to be reminded at every turn that the internet is the greatest unregulated experiment ever performed on humankind. And even harder not to conclude that, if it were possible, now might be a good time to end it.An Update on Our Family aired on Sky Documentaries and is on Now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionSocial mediaFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Like the gamethat preceded it, Citizen Sleeper 2 is packed with evocative portrayals of everyday life in outer space, from farmers tending zero-G crops in an asteroid greenhouse to water miners rising up against the cartel that controls them, everyone eking out a meagre existence in crumbling space stations left to rot by a long-dead mega corporation.Once again you’re cast as a Sleeper, a robot with a digitised human mind shorn of the memories of the person it was copied from. In the first game you were on the run from the firm that made you, attempting to wean your robot off its reliance on a stabilising drug. In the sequel you play a different Sleeper who has successfully managed to ditch Stabilizer, but at the cost of being enslaved to a gang boss called Laine.Whereas before the action was confined to a single space station, Erlin’s Eye, the second game roves much more widely across a sector of space called the Belt. Your explosive escape from Laine sees you hot-footing it from station to station, with a timer signalling how close on your tail the gang lord is. In this opening section it’s a race against time to gather enough fuel and supplies for the next leg of your journey, all the while searching for a way to sever the mysterious link Laine seems to have with your body.Each destination offers a visual backdrop of wherever you happen to be visiting, whether it’s a long-abandoned space border crossing or a populated asteroid, but mostly you’ll be reading text descriptions of what’s going on and clicking through conversations. As in the previous game you have five dice that are rolled at the start of each day (or “cycle”), and these can be plugged into various activities at each location, with higher numbers delivering a higher chance of success.View image in fullscreenThe second game roves much more widely through different locations … Citizen Sleeper 2.Photograph: Jump Over The AgeBut now, the dice can break. On timed, high-stakes missions, failure accumulates stress, which in turn can damage your dice. If a die’s energy reaches zero, it’s broken, unable to be used until it’s repaired. If all five dice break on normal difficulty, your character gains a permanent glitch: a die that always gives an 80% chance of failure.You’re joined on these contracts by up to two crew members. Like in Mass Effect 2, you can gather crew for your ship, The Rig, and each comes with two dice that are attuned to their specialities. You can also use a “push” once per cycle, increasing the number on your lowest die at the cost of raising your stress. All of this makes contracts wonderfully tense and involving, as you decide how far to push your luck at the risk of outright failure. And failure stalks Citizen Sleeper 2: whereas many games promise power fantasies, here each day is a valiant struggle (at least at first). Some missions are locked off if you’re don’t get to them in time. It’s a game that encourages repeat plays, to see how things might have turned out differently.Citizen Sleeper 2 is around twice as big as the first game, with many more locations to visit. But this does mean it feels a little stretched thin compared with the previous title. Rather than getting to know one place intimately, we instead have a scattering of space stations with a handful of activities in each. The crew also feel underused: it’s a shame there isn’t a way to upgrade their abilities or integrate them more into gameplay.Yet the characters are also the game’s greatest strength, and throughout they are expertly drawn, both literally (with comic book artist Guillaume Singelin once again providing some gorgeous portraits) and in terms of their compelling and heartfelt backstories. Despite its bleakness, the world of Citizen Sleeper 2 is full of compassion, and it’s a joy to return to the universe Gareth Damian Martin has created.Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is out on 31 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsGamesRole playing gamesNintendo SwitchPlayStation 5XboxPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

The tribal intensity of extremely online and extremely sensitive fandoms can lead to either a mild torrent of more tolerable abuse or something far darker, like death threats and sometimes doxing, an unending rage erupting from people who use emojis as avatars. There’s a great thriller to be made about this unpleasant tension, the fans who will do anything for their idol and the idol who will do nothing to stop them, but Opus, a poppy new A24 misfire premiering at Sundance, is not that movie.Sorry, Baby review – a warm, bitingly funny refocus of the trauma plotRead moreIt’s the first film from the writer-director Mark Anthony Green, who, like many before him, is so fixated on what he wants to say that he hasn’t been able to figure out how to say it. There’s maybe a slicker, simpler and more satisfying murder mystery to be told here – an assortment of media types picked off one-by-one at the remote ranch of a reclusive pop star – but he’s challenged himself with something far harder and ultimately too far out of his reach.The pop star is Alfred Moretti (deliciously played by John Malkovich), who retreated from the public eye decades ago and has now returned with what he claims will be the greatest album ever made. In Willy Wonka style, he has invited a select few to his desert compound for an extravagant listening party – an influencer (Stephanie Suganami), a paparazzo (Melissa Chambers), a rock star turned podcaster (Mark Sivertsen), a TV show host (Juliette Lewis), a magazine editor (Murray Bartlett) and, in a surprise twist, his inexperienced junior writer Ariel (Ayo Edebiri). She’s felt a little hemmed in, pitching interviews that then are given to someone else, and is prepared to make the most of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Moretti has surrounded himself with a cult-like community of robe-wearing yes men who believe in teachings that prioritise creativity above all else, turning their idol into more of a god. Like many final girls before her, Ariel is convinced something more sinister is at play.Green, a former GQ editor, has created a thriller that’s a little too on-trend to ever truly distinguish himself. It’s The Menu meets Blink Twice meets Glass Onion meets Midsommar meets Nine Perfect Strangers meets A Murder at the End of the World – a film that’s so familiar that even if it had been well-crafted, it would still feel reheated. There’s a pull to the opening scenes though, as Ariel tries to propel herself at work while being reminded by a friend that given her lack of substantive life experience and relatively easy background, her failure to be at a more progressed professional place is down to her being “middle as fuck”. Green also intersperses snippets of real pop culture (cameos from Wolf Blitzer, Bill Burr and Lenny Kravitz), yet they’re lost in a world that quickly feels fake and unmoored, his overly lit, overly quirky visual aesthetic and logic-free escalation taking us out of what could and should have been an involving thriller.The music, created by Nile Rodgers and The-Dream, is unusually impressive, perhaps not quite enough to demand such a fervent following but certainly convincing enough. A magnetic Malkovich fully commits to the bit too, purring and prancing around while his descent into menace is believably modulated. But Edebiri, who can be an incredibly charming comedic presence, is left completely adrift. Her shuffling, in-the-notes performance works initially as an eager yet unsure junior writer but as the film starts to shift into darker genre territory, that same low-energy persona feels distractingly out of place. One never really feels the grand life-or-death stakes from her, mild nervous irritation when full-body fear is needed. It’s most glaring in a final, feeble confrontation with Malkovich where one can sense an unintentional added tension between someone who knows how to handle the material and someone who clearly doesn’t, the two acting as if in wildly different movies.Not that a better actor could have done that much more with such a gentle whisper of a character facing a genuinely what-the-hell finale of absurd, long-winded explanation-giving that still leaves us scratching our heads. The reveals make little to no sense – carnage that’s too sudden and scrappy for something so ritualistic, a plan that requires too many variables to be seen as viable, an allegedly “of the moment” motivation that’s contradicted by the actual moment – and Green seems more focused on “wouldn’t it be sick if …” shocks rather than a plot that holds together. So much of what transpires is maddeningly pretentious yet hopelessly half-sketched as well as being shoddily stitched together as if some major, up-all-night surgery was then required in the editing suite. For a film so high on its own devilish intellect, it’s all incredibly stupid.It’s frustrating to see yet another first-time film-maker overstack their plate in such a way that feels less like the product of impressive ambition and more empty bravado. Like the many films and shows it’s shamelessly, monotonously following, there’s a snappy sellable pitch but again, there’s just no thought-out follow-through and, given how bad this particular example is and isbeing received, one hopes we’re nearing the end of this torturous cycle.Opus is screening at theSundance film festivaland will be in US cinemas on 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsSundance 2025First look reviewHorror filmsJohn MalkovichSundance film festivalFestivalsComedy filmsJuliette LewisreviewsShareReuse this content"

Khachaturian, born in Georgia into an Armenian family, was a composer with one foot in Soviet Russia and one in the Caucasus, and that comes through in music that’s a distinctive, inseparable mixture of Russian popular Romanticism with eastern modes and harmonies. The middle movement, incidentally, includes a rare outing for the musical saw, which here hovers eerily above the big tune as if someone were whistling along in the recording studio.View image in fullscreenKhachaturian: Jean-Yves Thibaudet album art.Photograph: DeccaThibaudet fills the rest of the disc with solo pieces, starting with the eminently recognisable love theme from Spartacus (in Thibaudet’s own skilful transcription) and the Sabre Dance from Gayane, his other hit ballet. Then, offering calm after the concerto’s storm, there are six miniatures from his Pictures from Childhood and the suite of incidental music he wrote for Lermontov’s play Masquerade, the work of a true theatre composer.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicGustavo Dudamelalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Tempos are steady and sombre, the playing full of warmth, and there are heartfelt vocal solos from Johanna Wallroth and Brian Mulligan. The tone in the first movement is beautifully dark, the lower strings (the violins are silent in this movement) taking the music down into a velvety blackness, the wind soloists lavishing care on every line. It’s a highly promising start. Yet while the attention to detail continues, so does the carefulness, and the latter is perhaps too dominant. The work’s sense of consolation is captured more convincingly than its suggestion of release: the culmination of the penultimate movement loses its joyous momentum and remains earthbound.View image in fullscreenBrahms: Ein Deutsches Requiem album art.Photograph: ChandosThat said, there’s much to enjoy. Mulligan’s baritone solo in the third movement conveys tension and desperation while still sounding beautiful, and is answered by choral singing that’s impressively agile and secure of pitch. However, although the large choral forces comprise three massed choirs, one isn’t often struck by their power: there’s not much space in the recorded sound between voices and orchestra, leaving the chorus feeling a little far back in the mix. The result is that, Mulligan excepted, the words don’t leap out quite as they should in this of all Requiems.Explore more on these topicsMusicClassical musicEdward Gardneralbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

At one point, an imperial Chinese investigator toughs it out in order to form an alliance with a gaggle of Irish hoodlums straight from Gangs of New York. “You held yourself so well back there,” his underlings congratulate him, before their leader’s legs give out. “Don’t let the Americans see. I’m about to pee myself!”The story here is that malevolent forces are stirring the great American melting pot. The son of local Tong leader Bai Xuanling (Chow Yun-fat, still with charisma on tap) is arrested for the murder of the daughter of racist Republican congressman Grant (John Cusack), so the former sends for wunderkind sleuth Qin Fu (Haoran Liu) – apparently deputised by the actual Sherlock Holmes – to get his kid off the hook. Also killed the same night was a Native American elder, whose son Gui (Baoquiang Wang) swears revenge and becomes pig-tailed Watson to Fu’s junior Holmes. No explanation (at first) for why he can speak fluent Hebei dialect.The plot sprawls in all directions, with lots of enjoyable hokum from the moment Fu falls semi-naked from a bathroom window into Gui’s poncho to the sound of the Platters’ Only You. Reading crime scenes according to the principles of Chinese medicine, Fu comports himself like a cocky, inane Tintin, while Gui pumps his muscles up with acupuncture needles at strategic moments like a bodybuilding Tonto. There’s a total blitheness about the racelifting aspect of Wang playing a Native American; the film opts instead for a heartwarming general emphasis on racial tolerance and mixing seemingly exemplified by a showstopping scene in which a carousel of the wrong people appear from a magician’s box.Tightly paced and snappily directed, this is decent-quality Chinese screwball, if a touch overlong. It’s a shame that the film mars its own message of internationalconfreriein an oddly pointed coda where Bai warns of his adopted homeland: “There’s so much we can learn from this place. Study your opponent’s strength before going into battle.” Then another character predicts thatChinawill soon be the world’s most powerful nation. There ends the sponsored message from the Chinese Communist party; you can’t say they don’t leave us clues to pick up on.Detective Chinatown 1900 is in UK and Irish cinemas from 29 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersComedy filmsCrime filmsPeriod and historical filmsChinaAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Diving in a frozen lake at night – below ice, beneath the stars, at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres? What an absurd idea.An hour ago, I was inside a tiny mountain refuge beside Lac Robert drinking tea, the temperature outside dropping by the second. Now, I’m outdoors and zipped into a cumbersome drysuit (designed to prevent water from entering), with blue latex gauntlets sealed at the wrists and a black frogman hood wrenched over my head.View image in fullscreenDivers camp the night surrounded by 2,500-metre peaks.Photograph: Mike MacEacheranIce diving as a niche activity took off in the 1990s, offering an alternative adventure for thrill-seekers on their ski holidays. It’s available in two other French mountain resorts, Tignes and Val-Cenis. But here, above the village of Chamrousse where I’m staying, ice diving school Dive Xtreme has launched the region’s most intense, magical, low-impact thrill yet: a night dive in a frozen mountain lake, followed by a starlit night’s camping on its frozen surface amid 2,500-metre peaks.I shiver. I look like a cosmonaut. I feel like packaged hamForget cold water swimming. This is the equivalent of taking the plunge under the north pole. The appeal, for me, is to get out of my comfort zone and experience what the instructors behind the idea, 25-year-old Thibault Dassieu and Tanguy Chamard, 30, describe as a chance to “connect both outwards to the wonders of the high-altitude landscape and inwards to the adventurer hidden within us all”.As I wait in the deep snow, weight belts are slung over each shoulder and a heavy scuba tank lifted on to my back. Then a full-face respirator mask is strapped on tight. A gasket on my survival suit is opened, the air rattles out, everything tightens around me and the diving suit sticks to my skin. I shiver. I look like a cosmonaut; I feel like packaged ham.View image in fullscreen‘Unlike regular diving, where scuba divers aim to float horizontally, the technique under ice is to remain vertical.’Photograph: Hemis/AlamyThe lake feels wild and secret, but it’s only a cable car and chairlift ride from Chamrousse, 20 miles south of Grenoble in Isère. The tiny resort in the Belledonne massif styles itself as an easily accessible base camp for micro-adventures and offers skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling, as well as short dog-sledding trips – and now ice diving.Anyone can have a go – no experience is necessary, though divers must be at least 140cm tall and eight years old (the oldest so far was an 83-year-old grandmother). I’ve dived a few times, but this feels completely different – an opportunity to connect with nature in its rawest form. Looking down into the two metre-wide hole (cleft anew with an axe every morning), I take one last jolt of breath then we’re into the icy soup. Tanguy, all jokes and smiles, is relaxed. Me, nervous, almost paralysed. A pink line rips along the snow-covered horizon. “Now you’ll see why I’m addicted to this,” he says. As we vanish below, the world feels put on pause.The first myth about ice diving is that it’s achingly cold. But with the lake temperature at around 1C, the surface is far colder and it feels like slithering into a tepid bath, though one with a snow-covered crust of metre-thick ice and an infused glow from the hazy surface torchlight.The second is that it is risky. “When you scuba dive in the ocean, the danger is the depth,” says Thibault. “In Lac Robert, we’re a maximum distance of five metres from the ice and here the biggest issue is getting lost. This lake isn’t big enough – so it’s impossible.” A guide rope helps ease any panic, as do two additional emergency exits out of the ice. Fear remains though: some divers feel claustrophobic, others disoriented.View image in fullscreenThe 10-minute circuit of the frozen lake is perfectly safe – there is a guide rope and two additional emergency exits out of the ice.Photograph: Chloé HalotThe gateway ice hole is a trap door into another realm. At first, I struggle to gain my buoyancy. Unlike regular diving, where scuba divers aim to float horizontally, the technique under ice is to remain vertical, with flippers pointed down and arms free to discover the rink above. The imperative is to empty all the air out of the drysuit. Otherwise, a jack-in-the-box bob results in a bump to the head.We kick our flippers and our 10-minute loop around the lake begins. Lines of dimly lit ice curve away from me and through my mask I make out ribs of iced fissures and mutated crystals. In places the submarine ice has begun to thaw. Shapes appear and my mind stretches.Time slows in this magical, watery world. A miniature tornado of loose ice spins and scatters into luminous shards and bubblesTanguy turns entertainer as my eyes adapt to the dark. He lays a hand on the shelf above us and, as if by magic, passes me a torchlit sliver as part of a surreal, silent show-and-tell. Immediately it slips from my grasp, falling, spinning, fading into the abyss. He exhales deeply from his regulator; the result is an arc of bubbles that disperse and dance through my torch’s beam. Eerie, lurking crackles pop from above, echoing in the blackness.View image in fullscreenThe director of DiveXtreme clears ice to create a ‘skylight’.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyTime slows in this magical, watery world. Tanguy twirls an index finger like a cocktail stirrer and a miniature tornado of loose ice spins and scatters into luminous shards and bubbles. I’m mesmerised. I feel I could hang out here for hours, but all too soon the dive ends and I am hauled back on to the snow by Thibault and an anchor rope. Now I look like a cosmonaut, but feel like a rescued whale.That night, dried, changed, and our equipment defrosting in the refuge, Tanguy cooks fondue outside on a picnic table and the lake is transformed by the Milky Way. White wine is passed around. The pan of cheese is quickly emptied. Woolly hats are pulled down tight.View image in fullscreenInside the refuge.Photograph: Mike MacEacheranEventually the stove is blown out. Soft snow begins to fall. I tread through the drifts to my tent on the lake. It is secured by threaded ice screws and snow-packed at the sides. I crawl into a down sleeping bag, the mountain silence interrupted by wind and what I imagine are burbles of ice and belching water below. The irony is a broken, restless sleep follows. I am too hot.Around 7am, a thin mist creeps into the lake eyrie and croissants and coffee are served in the refuge where the instructors have slept. We wait for the chairlift tostart the journey back to the village, via the Croix de Chamrousse summit at 2,250m, chatting about our mad but memorable evening.It’s one of those rare moments in life, I say, that seem to transcend the ordinary. When it’s possible to feel suspended, as if between life and death, all while haloed in a strangely brilliant glow cast from above. The pair nod. The mountain gods may have given them a frozen lake, but they have filled it with an adventure that feels almost not of this earth.The trip was provided byAlpes Isère.

Of these, 11 were commercial poultry farms.While the outbreaks have been contained, Australia takes a zero-tolerance approach to HPAI. The viral illness can be fatal and spread between wild birds and farmed poultry. The protocol after any reported infection is the euthanasia of all birds on a farm. The federal government estimates 1.8 million birds were killed last year.This resulted in fewer hens and reduced the total volume of egg production. Hospitality operators and retailers have been affected over the past six months and some supermarket shelves remain bare.Eggs have also become more expensive. The price of eggs rose by 11.2% in the last three months of 2024, data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed. Apart from lamb and goat meat, eggs recorded the highest price increase of any food category recorded by the ABS.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailEarlier this month, Egg Farmers of Australia (EFA) issued a statement acknowledging that the shortage had continued, which it attributed to the HPAI outbreak, among other factors.The peak body for the industry said the “majority of farms” affected by the disease have now been restocked and it expected the supply of eggs to begin returning to normal.The EFA’s chief executive, Melinda Hashimoto, declined to comment further when contacted by Guardian Australia last week as she said the peak body did not want its “positive Australia Day story” to be “overshadowed” by one about supply issues. The other egg industry peak body – Australian Eggs – did not respond to requests for comment.What other factors are contributing to the shortage?The EFA also cited high seasonal demand and caged eggs being phased out as contributing factors.‘Rape is effectively decriminalised’: how did sexual assault become so easy to get away with?Read moreIt said the industry was “facing a transitional period” as some farms shifted from cage egg production to barn-laid or free-range, which it said was also affecting supply due to the need to buy and upgrade infrastructure.In 2023, Australia’s agriculture ministers made a commitment toban cage eggs by 2036in accordance with the new national animal welfare standards and guidelines for poultry that had been updated in 2022. The changes were brought in after decades of consumer pressure but there was opposition from some parts of the industry.The final timeframe was to be set by individual states and territories after consultation with the industry.Coles and Woolworths had committed to phasing out caged eggs by the beginning of 2025 but the supermarkets have pushed back the deadline.Woolworths updated its animal welfare policy to say it was “continuing our work towards” using only cage-free eggs as an ingredient in its own brand products and was “committed to all vendor branded whole shell eggs we sell being cage free” by the end of 2025.Coles has said it is will phase out all caged eggs nationally in 2025. A spokesperson for the supermarket said this was in line with the retail industry’s target.“All Coles own-brand shell eggs sold nationally have been cage-free since 2013,” they said. “We have already achieved a cage-free status for branded shell eggs in Western Australia, Victoria and South Australia.”How are supermarkets managing the supply issues?In some states, both Woolworths and Coles continue to have limits on the number of cartons of eggs you can buy at a time, which have been in place since July last year.Woolworths has a two-pack purchase limit on eggs in all states except Western Australia. It says a majority of its customers only buy one carton of eggs a shop anyway.A Woolworths spokesperson said its supply was “stable” but it would “unfortunately … take a while longer to rebuild” the number of laying hens in Australia after the HPAI outbreak.“The usual higher demand for eggs over Christmas and the new year’s period put an additional short-term strain on the availability of eggs across all retailers,” they said.“Our egg supply has continued to improve and we are working closely with our suppliers to source as many eggs as possible.”The new school year is usually a time of joy but Jewish parents in Sydney are anxious and uncertainRead moreColes is in a similar position.“Following the avian influenza outbreaks last year, we have been consulting with our suppliers, industry bodies and government to understand the implications and long-term impacts of the outbreaks,” a spokesperson for the supermarket said.“We will continue to work closely with impacted suppliers to support their recovery.”Aldi declined to comment. The discount supermarket has experienced a small decrease in the supply of eggs but it has not imposed a limit on the number of cartons customers can buy.Will the situation resolve anytime soon?The Victorian Farmers Federation general manager of policy and advocacy, Charles Everist, says while last year’s HPAI protocols have been formally lifted the egg shortage won’t resolve until later this year.“There is a lag that comes with that because the farms need to be repopulated and that doesn’t happen overnight,” he said. “The shortages we’re seeing could continue for the next six months.”Everist says the industry is struggling to meet demand and is also having to tackle additional biosecurity measures with the H5N1 strain of bird flu “on our doorstep”. Variants of this strain of the virus have been detected in humans overseas.TheH5 strains of bird flu are “high pathogenicity”, which means they are considered more likely to kill birds infected by them.Australia has had no reported outbreaks of the H5N1 strain,although cases have escalatedsince 2022 overseas including in England and the US.However, as a spokesperson for the federal agriculture department says: “There is no way to prevent new strains of bird flu viruses entering Australia with wild birds, or transmission between wild birds.”They said the government has invested more than $100m to strengthen surveillance and response measures if there is a H5 bird flu outbreak here.Just this week, the World Organisation for Animal Healthconfirmed the first outbreakof a novel strain – H5N9 – in poultry had been detected on a duck farm in California.Explore more on these topicsEggsSupermarketsFoodexplainersShareReuse this content"
