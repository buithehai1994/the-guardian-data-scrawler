Her stock answer to any question was that “Everything is terrible”. The Tories had bankrupted the country. There was no money for anything. Pensioners were going to have to die to save the rest of the country. Everywhere she looked there was only a world of pain.And more pain was all she had to offer. But hers would be aLabourpain. A fiscally responsible Labour pain. A pain for which the country had voted in the last election. A pain which everyone would stoically bear in the national interest. The sunlit uplands would have to wait a while.Only less than a year on and it turns out that people aren’t all that thrilled with being offered a diet of yet more pain. They have had enough of that under the Tories. They had voted for Labour because they hoped they would offer an alternative.A morally superior, fiscally responsible pain might sound good in theory, but people have had enough of everything being a bit shit. Even if they can logically understand it might take a while for Reeves to turn things round, they don’t want to hear about it. They would rather be lied to that there are quick fixes available. Just text Nigel Farage and he will offer you any number of them.Rachel had promised us only one major financial event a year. After the budget and the spring statement we now had a third. The spending review: a budget without the tax rises. For this spending review the Ministering Angel of Death had tried to reincarnate herself as the Archangel of Hope. A beacon of light and joy who was here to tell us all that things were going to be great after all. More than that, they were great now. A lesson to all of us in cognitive dissonance.After a prime minister’s questions in which Kemi Badenoch had reminded everyone that she really wasn’t that good in the job by saying how much she hoped to improve, the Archangel of Hope got to her feet. She did her best to sound upbeat, but it didn’t come naturally. Still, fake it to make it.Her purpose in life was to make everyone feel better off. And she had more or less done that. Tick for Rachel’s life goal. If you didn’t feel better, then the problem was with you. She had done her bit. This was a contract with the people and the people had to pull their weight.It was all going to be an uphill struggle. Yes, she knew that most of the money she was going to promise was for capital projects that wouldn’t see the light of day for years, but she wanted everyone to look on the bright side.Day-to-day spending might be down and you might still be waiting too long for a life-saving operation but it was a good moment to go and look at a field and imagine how it would look with an affordable housing development on it in 15 years’ time. Labour MPs nodded along and cheered. They could do this. Keir Starmer looked slightly preoccupied. Maybe he knew something they didn’t.Next, the Archangel of Hope switched her attention to the opposition parties. Here she was on much stronger ground. You might think that she wasn’t entirely in command of all the numbers but just spare a moment to think of the alternatives. Then you will come running back to Labour. The Tories she dismissed in a sentence. Fourteen years and Liz Truss. She and the country no longer takes them seriously. The real opposition is Nigel Farage. Much of her speech was aimed at Reform. Nige had loved the Liz Truss budget and was now making even greater fantasy tax and spending commitments than she had. If you wanted to be broke, then Farage was your man.We then went into a 20-minute lacuna of suspended animation. Rachel might have been talking of her excitement of renewal –a time of plenty for housing, defence and health– but it didn’t come across in her delivery. Rather the words died in her mouth. She isn’t a fluent communicator. There had been a month-long buildup of leaks and speculation to this speech and now we were in danger of nodding off.Even so, it didn’t really feel as if we were missing that much. Sure there wasa promise to end the use of hotels for immigrants– something Labour should have done much earlier – and there were some large sums mentioned elsewhere, but the devil would be in the detail. The areas of public spending that the Archangel of Hope said she valued but which came with no money attached. Presumably these were just honourable mentions in despatches. Areas that were actually in line for real terms cuts.But today was not a day for bad news. This was a day when the money tree was turned on. Especially for Labour MPs in areas that are threatened by Reform. Of the 20 Trailblazing English towns in line for a £20m handout, 19 are Labour seats. Even better, Reeves had identified £14bn of efficiency savings. The UK was going to get its very own Doge. Only this time the money would be passed back topublic spendingelsewhere. These were Labour choices. The choices of the British people. Everything was for the best in the best of all possible worlds.It’s becoming increasingly hard not to feel just a little bit sorry for Mel Stride. OK, we know he’s out of his depth and he has the air of a home counties bank manager whose branch has been scheduled for closure, but it’s a thankless task being shadow chancellor. He mumbled something about tax rises that may or may not come in the autumn, but mostly he was made to betray the fact that he had no clue what the Tories would do if they were in power. Not that anyone is about to make the mistake of handing them power any time soon. But the Melster smiled gamely. He is content with his own mediocrity.That just left the Archangel of Hope to wind things up. It was time for everyone to cheer up. The era of miserabilism was over.Labour had turned the corner. Everything was going to be great whether you liked it or not. Happy days were here again.Explore more on these topicsSpending review 2025The politics sketchRachel ReevesTax and spendingPublic financeNHSHousingImmigration and asylumcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a crucial tale of a four-month nightmare that is barely believableHannah J DaviesWed 11 Jun 2025 17.50 EDTShareIf it were a work of fiction, the story of Flight 149 would probably be deemed too horrifying – or too unbelievable – for television. Indeed, as a documentary interspersed with dramatic reconstructions, at points it is almost unbearable to watch. But it is a crucial piece of work: a one-off film that goes deep into a bizarre and increasingly hideous ordeal to ask how and why it happened.On 2 August 1990, a British Airways plane carrying nearly 400 passengers and crew from London to Kuala Lumpur touched down for a scheduled stopover in Kuwait. Those on board knew nothing of the unfolding Iraqi invasion of the country and the brutality Saddam Hussein was inflicting on his neighbours (this would, of course, soon lead tothe Gulf war). British Airways maintains that it, too, was unaware of what was taking place, while the British government said it didn’t know what was happening until after the plane had landed. Later, it would emerge that it had, in fact, received information before the plane had reached the terminal, but thatit wasn’t shared with the airline.Staggeringly, many of those on board would spend the next four months in the country, human shields in an unfurling international conflict, with no clear route home. Charlie Kristiansson, a former BA steward, recalls the place looking “like the gates of hell had opened”, as bombs began to explode around them. Initially, the passengers were put up in a plush hotel – a cocoon of sorts, he says. But as time went on, they were dispatched to various squalid locations, including a bungalow where the walls were smothered in excrement.The goal ofJenny Ash’s documentary – much like the multi-Bafta-winning Mr BatesVs the Post Office– is as much to entertain as to shine a light on what may be a colossal miscarriage of justice. Many of the interviewees here don’t simply address a faceless producer behind a camera – they sit face to face with lawyers from the human rights firm McCue Jury & Partners. Last year, these testimonies were used to constructa class-action lawsuit against BA and the government.The government could have diverted Flight 149, but – for reasons that remain unclear – didn’t. Stephen Davis, an investigative journalist who reported on the story for the Independent on Sunday at the time, has helped to illuminate what else may have been going on. Namely, allegations that the flight was used to aid a British intelligence operation.‘As complicit as Saddam’: people on BA flight held hostage in Kuwait sue UK governmentRead moreThere are interviews here with Margaret Thatcher’s former foreign affairs private secretary Charles Powell and the former US diplomat Barbara Bodine. These are bolstered by archive material that transports viewers back to the chaos unfolding on news bulletinsand even Teletext. But the real heft comes from the survivors’ stories, which sit side by side with reconstructions that feel hazy and incredibly unnerving and which mirror the subjects’ dissociation.Jennifer Chappell, then 12, recalls seeing the lyrics of theGuns N’ Roses song Paradise Cityon the walls of the military compound where she and her family were held. The moment is recreated by a young actor (Orla Taylor), who lies on a bed in the foetal position singing along to Axl Rose (“Oh, won’t you please take me home?”).Elsewhere, Kristiansson flinches as he relives the savage sexual assault he was subjected to by an Iraqi soldier, as we are drawn, flashback-like, into the kind of stark tower block where it happened. Barry Manners, separated from his partner, Anthony Yong, in excruciating circumstances, recalls the places he would go in his brain to escape the horror of being locked in a dark room at the site of a dam, not knowing whether it was night or day. Viewers see the couple as they would have been in another life, listening to jazz on a beach in Thailand. Yong died not long after returning to the UK, his already poor health exacerbated by the nightmare of it all.Unsurprisingly, the passengers of Flight 149 think about what happened every day. Chappell has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder and has attempted to kill herself. The nearest we get to a happy ending is when Deborah Saloom, an American passenger, recounts her reunion with her husband, known as B George, whom she feared she would never see again (women and children were let out of the country before the men). Stress is engraved into the faces of practically every person we see on screen.Then head of security at Kuwait airport, Mohammad Al-Dossari, says the BA passengers were “used like chess pieces”. Now, what they desperately want to know is what the people moving those pieces were thinking. Or, as Manners puts it: “Why the fuck was I in this situation in the first place?” Even if we don’t get all the answers, this is a truly excellent place to start.Flight 149: Hostage of War aired on Sky Documentaries and is available on NowIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Recognisable faces such asKatherine Parkinson(Molly Weasley), Johnny Flynn (Lucius Malfoy) and Daniel Rigby (Vernon Dursley) have been joined by the newcomers Leo Earley, Alessia Leoni and Sienna Moosah. Well, RIP their mentions.We have been here before – recently and often. Harry Potter has become such a febrile battleground that the pattern has already become well worn. When John Lithgow was announced as Dumbledore, he revealed that a friend had sent hima link to an articleentitled: “An open letter to John Lithgow: Please walk away from Harry Potter.”This is only the tip of the iceberg. When Nick Frost was named as the new Hagrid – a role he claims to have manifested by writing down the word “Hagrid” 5,000 times – he quickly had to disable comments on Instagram, thengave an interviewin which he said that his opinions “don’t align in any way, shape or form” with those of JK Rowling. Paapa Essiedu attempted to get in front of the controversy by signinga petitioncalling for the UK entertainment industry to protect trans people, but this didn’t shield him from criticism. All three actors have tried to ameliorate the controversy in their own way; all three have been criticised anyway.But this is the predicament we find ourselves in. A few years ago, announcing yourself as the star of aHarry Potterseries would have simply told the world that you had decided to receive a lot of money over many years from a studio that had a dearth of new ideas. But, in 2025, a Harry Potter actor isn’t just taking a job on a TV show; they are making a political statement, whether they like it or not.As such, this week’s announcement of the new cast members was met with weary sighs on social media. Parkinson has come in for especially sustained attacks, given that her breakout role was in The IT Crowd, made by Graham Linehan, who is on the same side as Rowling when it comes to gender.Presumably, Parkinson doesn’t spend her days Googling the screenwriter of every script she receives to see if they are trans-exclusionary. But now she – and the other actors named on Monday, plus anyone even tangentially associated with Harry Potter – is under pressure to declare a side. In short, the whole thing is a mess.This isn’t going to go away any time soon. It’s more than a year until the Harry Potter series airs, which means it won’t finish for at least a decade. Lithgow has said it will probably be his final major role, since he will be pushing 90 by the time it wraps. Every time anything of note happens – any time there is a junket or a new actor is cast – the issue will be front and centre. The actors who oppose Rowling will be forced to do it over and over again. The same goes for the ones who agree with her. The ones who just want a quiet life will twist themselves into knots trying to say as little as possible in the face of direct questioning.

TheTitan sub disasterwas inescapable for weeks as the story evolved from critical rescue mission – the best-case scenario being a mechanical failure deep in the North Atlantic with 96 hours of oxygen for the five passengers, which you better believe became a countdown clock on cable news – to tragic recovery operation.‘Incredibly disturbing’: docuseries goes inside jaw-dropping LA mortuary scandalRead moreThe sub, it turned out, had imploded at 3,300 meters beneath the surface, 90 minutes into a dive that was supposed to reach 3,800 meters deep. All five passengers – British explorer Hamish Harding, British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman, French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet and submersible owner Stockton Rush – were killed instantly.Even as the search for the sub, whose wreckage was eventually returned to land, continued in earnest, concerning reports about the safety record at OceanGate, the company which operated the vehicle, began to emerge: that a whistleblower had declared implosion of the sub’s trademark carbon fiber hull a mathematical certainty years earlier. That Rush, the company’s founder and CEO, pursued commercial voyages anyway, eluding any type of third-party certification. For the majority of the public, the story ended along those lines: a preventable tragedy, another sin of human hubris at arguably the most famous shrine to the folly of human hubris in history.That is not wrong; according to the newNetflixdocumentary Titan: The OceanGate Disaster, the sub’s implosion was virtually guaranteed by its design. “I’m convinced, based on the research and the discussions that I’ve had, that the submersible Titan could have imploded at any time,” said the film’s director, Mark Monroe. In fact, it was “absolutely shocking” that Titan made as many successful dives – 80 attempts, 13 to Titanic depth, between 2021 and 2022 – as it did. But for those who either worked at OceanGate, were tasked with the investigation or loved someone lost on board, the story is much more complicated, and concerning, than a design flaw.Another film would proceed through an exact timeline of Titan’s final mission on 18 June, 2023; include footage of the wreckage or diagrams of its descent coordinated to text messages sent to its surface-level team; play the audio of its implosion, recorded 900 miles away by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration device; or allow viewers to see Rush’s wife Wendy hear the implosion, whose sound reached its support ship, Polar Prince, before their last text message, allowing them to mistakenly assume the sub was fine. The Netflix film, made by the veteran production company Story Syndicate, doesn’t do any of that, eschewing a Seconds from Disaster-type narrative and instead focusing on the nearly decade-long procession toward disaster, through numerous decisions prizing flashy ambition over safety.“It’s scarier, in a way, to understand the decision-making over the 10-year period that led to that moment,” said Monroe. “I feel pretty strongly if the civilians” – the paying customers OceanGate called “mission specialists” to skirt around commercial maritime safety regulations – “had seen the decisions made along the way, they would have been a lot more reticent to get into that submersible. And I think that was not clear, or made clear, to the public.”With access to company footage, data, files and several former employees and whistleblowers, the 111-minute documentary paints a fuller picture of a company with idealistic ambition and plenty of scientific backing – at least at first. Founded outside Seattle in 2009 by Rush, an entrepreneur with a rich family and an engineering degree, OceanGate attracted talent from the fields of engineering, diving and marine exploration with its ambition to revolutionize deep sea travel for the masses. The question of how to make deep subs, usually made of very heavy titanium steel, lighter and nimbler – and thus commercially viable – was an appealing puzzle to an array of scientists, deep-sea divers and exploration enthusiasts.It’s what drew David Lochridge, a highly experienced submersible pilot, to uproot his family and move to Everett, Washington, to become OceanGate’s operations director. In the film, Lochridge explains that he didn’t initially understand, on a technical level, OceanGate’s answer to the lightweight, deep-sea sub conundrum: carbon fiber, a lightweight but high-strength composite material of tightly pack carbon threads cemented with resin, used in everything from sports cars to deluxe skis. But in time, the material’s problems became clear. For one, carbon fiber had never been tested at extreme depths, and thus had no reliable safety record. And two, its integrity naturally degrades with repeated use. “There is a fatigue aspect to carbon fiber – once you use it, it won’t be as good the next time you use it, by increments,” Monroe explained.The documentary includes ample footage from OceanGate’s years-long test phase, as various carbon fiber designs failed in experiments simulating high pressure. Nevertheless, Rush persisted, dismissing safety concerns from engineers on staff and continuing to insist to credulous media that commercial ventures to the Titanic were soon within reach. Lochridge and others attest to Rush’s hardheaded approach, at times openly hostile to any intra-company dissent. He openly admired Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, expressing a desire to, as one employee recalled, be a “big swinging dick”.View image in fullscreenProducer Lily Garrison, David Lochridge, director Mark Monroe and producer Jon Bardin.Photograph: Bryan Derballa/Getty ImagesIn that vein, Rush claimed to be working with Boeing, Nasa and the University of Washington, though no formal partnerships existed. (In fact, a Boeing engineer involved in Titan’s early designs emailed Rush in March 2012: “We think you are at high risk of a significant failure at or before you reach 4,000 meters. We do not think you have any safety margin.”) Rush also elected to withhold any OceanGate craft from third-party safety inspections, the industry standard for submersibles.That decision proved to be a breaking point for several employees; Lochridge was fired after he inspected Titan himself, and said in a written report to Rush that he had no confidence in the submersible. The documentary includes remarkable audio of a 2018 senior staff meeting in which Rush fires Lochridge and quashes his concerns as a discrepancy of vision – “I don’t want anybody in this company who is uncomfortable with what we’re doing. We’re doing weird shit here and I am definitely out of the mold. There’s no question. I am doing things that are completely non-standard.”“There is a danger in the kind of cult of personality, particularly the tech bro, ‘move fast and break things,’” Monroe said. “When other people’s lives are in the balance, I think we should all take a step back and be careful about that. It’s one thing to put unmanned spacecraft into space, but you’re taking money to provide an expedition.”One has to wonder, given all the dissent, given the fact that the sub would produce loud cracking sounds with each descent (which Rush called, unscientifically, the carbon fiber “seasoning” with use) – did the CEO actually believe it was safe? “I’m not in Stockton’s mind, so I don’t know,” said Monroe. But he took into account Rush’s public personality as a maverick, the media tailwinds in his favor. “When you say you’re going to go to Titanic in a new submersible that no one’s ever done before, and the sound of your own voice resonates year after year while you’re trying to figure out how to do it, I think there’s a pressure that builds, that suggests ‘I have to do this.’”What is clear, from numerous interviews, was that “if you went against the boss, there were going to be repercussions.” Lochridge knows this well; after he filed a whistleblower complaint with the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha), OceanGate sued him for improperly disclosing confidential information to regulators. The legal costs, and Osha’s protracted investigation, forced him to withdraw his complaint, ending what could have been the one regulatory oversight on the company.OceanGate continued apace; the film lingers only briefly on the dive in 2022 which seemed to damage the sub, even according to the company’s own “real-time monitoring system”. Titan imploded on its next dive to Titanic depths a year later, after several aborted attempts due to inclement weather. Though the “delamination” of the carbon fiber hull is the presumed cause, the US Coast Guard’s official written report, including recommendations for the prevention of a similar tragedy, has yet to be publicly released. “I don’t know what those recommendations could be,” said Monroe, “but you would think they would have to do with how to run an experimental submersible when offering it to the public.”Such as, perhaps, oversight, or a healthier sense of skepticism when the only safety assurances come from the company itself. Rush “believed in the ethos of move fast and break things. Rules don’t apply when you want to change the way things work,” said Monroe. “That’s dangerous when other people’s lives are at stake. There are certain rules that do apply, like the rules of physics, the rules of science – these rules do apply to all of us.”Titan: The OceanGate Disaster is now available on NetflixExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsTitanic sub incidentNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ostensibly, Full Fat Legend poses the question “What the hell am I?”, as theTaskmasterman looks past his professional title and family roles to reveal the true Greg beneath.

But 12-year-old in a (very) outsized body has always beenDavies’ shtick. I found the fixation on bums and willies a bit much in this latest offering, perhaps because it goes on so long. But if, after six decades, Davies’ sense of humour remains juvenilely self-absorbed, at least he has the good grace to acknowledge it, and the craft to often turn it to fine comic effect. See the “face full of new freckles” image-making that accompanies one anecdote about attempting to clean his “baggy bumhole”.That’s one of several humiliating stories that demonstrate – according to Davies – that he’s not, in fact, a legend, but a complete chump instead. Others include tales of sleepless life with a swollen prostate, and of “dick-dialling” by accident a prominent government minister. We also get the explanation for why Davies turned out this way, with reference to the unreconstructed world of his youth (“It was a different time. It was an awful time”), when parental love was tough and sex education came via the Freemans lingerie catalogue.A lot of that material feels familiar, but Davies brings great gusto to its revival. Along the way, a handful of stories (one about an eccentric Irish “animal handler”; another about Danny Dyer) de-centre Davies and his ostentatious puerility, which can come as a relief. It’s a show, finally, about one manchild’s struggle to get over himself, his neuroses and ego – and on this evidence, he still has some way to go.Touring until 11 AprilExplore more on these topicsComedyGreg DaviesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Hormonal changes, pelvic or back pain, stress and extra bathroom trips are among the delights that can make sleep elusive for pregnant women. As your baby bump grows, general discomfort is a given.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Pregnancy pillows aim to help relieve some of this discomfort by supporting key parts of the body, such as your growing baby bump, back and hips. Many are designed to encourage an optimal pregnancy sleeping position: theNHS recommendssleeping on your side after 28 weeks. That’s due to research suggesting a link between falling asleep on your back and an increased risk of stillbirth – although note that the overall risk is still very low, and there’s no need to worry if you wake up on your back. Just roll over and go back to sleep.At a glanceBest pregnancy pillow overall:Bbhugme pregnancy pillow£159 at BbhugmeBest budget pregnancy pillow:Dreamgenii pregnancy, support and feeding pillow£48.99 at EbebekBest pregnancy pillow for leg support:Snüz SnuzCurve pregnancy support pillow£84.95 at SnüzBest for temperature control:Simba extra support body pillow£109 at Simba SleepWhy you should trust meMy usual expertise is in technology, and I’ve tested all kinds of tech gadgets and AI tools in my decade or so as a tech journalist. But what really made me the perfect tester for prenatal pillows is that I was entering the third trimester of my own pregnancy as testing began – a stage I would describe as “how is everything suddenly so uncomfortable?” Throw in a dash of persistent pregnancy insomnia, and I developed a deep personal interest in unearthing the best maternity pillows for a decent night’s sleep.How I testedView image in fullscreenOur writer gives the Bbhugme pregnancy pillow a whirl.Photograph: Victoria Turk/The GuardianThere are many pregnancy pillows on the market, most of which fall into a few main categories: C-shaped, U-shaped, wedge or I-shaped (which I more often found myself calling “sausage”). I selected pillows that were popular with buyers, sparked discussion on pregnancy forums, offered unique features or simply dominated internet ads. I tested 11 in total.To test, I shamelessly cheated on my existing pillows by sleeping with each contender for at least two nights. I kept notes on firmness, support, comfort and how much bed space each pillow took up. I also noted their aesthetics, ranging from chic to orthopaedic, and their versatility. Some convert into nursing pillows after birth, which extends their usefulness and adds value.The best judge of a pregnancy pillow, of course, is a good night’s sleep. I tracked mine using a smartwatch, focusing on total sleep time and time spent in deep sleep (though I took other factors into account too).The best pregnancy pillows in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The GuardianBest pregnancy pillow overall:Bbhugme pregnancy pillowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The Guardian£159 at Bbhugme£159 at John LewisThe Bbhugme is a flexible, microbead-filled cylinder that can be moved into an I or J shape the full length of the body, or a smaller C (useful for sitting) or U (for between the legs). It comes with a cotton jersey cover, secured at the end with plastic “pebbles,” giving the overall impression of an oversized sausage – emphasised by the dusty pink colour of my test pillow. “You look like you’re riding a hotdog,” my husband said as I straddled it sloth-on-a-branch style.Why we love itThe revelation of the Bbhugme is the microbead filling, which gives flexibility in both its shape and firmness. It was easy to mould the pillow around me so that it supported my bump, went between my legs and kept me nestled in a comfortable side sleeping position.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The GuardianDespite its size, it’s lightweight and pliable, making it easy to move when I shifted sides in the night. It even offered some comfort during a 1am bout of Braxton Hicks (“false labour”) contractions.Its adjustability makes it a great all-rounder. I can see it being useful at all stages of pregnancy, as support needs shift, and after birth as a nursing bolster. The covers come in a range of muted tones, so the pillow can blend in with most bedroom decor.It’s a shame that …at £159, the Bbhugme’s comfort also comes at a hefty price – this is not a budget option.Suitable for:pregnancy and nursingShape:I-shapedSize:140-145 x 20cmFilling material:microbeadsCover material:95% cotton, 5% spandex jerseyBest budget pregnancy pillow:Dreamgenii pregnancy, support and feeding pillowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The Guardian£48.99 at Ebebek£57.99 at Mamas & PapasThe Dreamgenii pillow is a sort-of C-shape (G-shape, perhaps?) that curves under your bump and through your legs, as with most pillows, but also provides an attached back support, similar to a wedge. This means it offers support on both sides of your body without taking up the space of a full U-shaped pillow.Why we love itThe Dreamgenii’s cotton jersey cover felt particularly soft against the skin and, although large, the pillow didn’t feel too unwieldy in the bed. Its very particular shape is specifically designed for side sleeping, and it offered ample support for this, with the back wedge helping to prevent unintended rolling and keeping me in position.Despite its odd shape, the pillow does promise some versatility: after birth, Dreamgenii suggests using it for nursing too, by wrapping the leg support behind your back and using the back support to help cradle your baby. It’s also reasonably priced.It’s a shame that …you can’t adjust the gap between the front and back pillows, which would be a nice way to support changing bump size. Because the pillow is specifically shaped for sleeping on one side, it’s also cumbersome to shift position in the night.Suitable for:pregnancyShape:C-shaped (ish)Size:102 x 77cmFilling material:polyester hollow fibreCover material:100% jersey cottonThe best eco-friendly baby products: 11 sustainable substitutes, from reusable nappies to wipesRead moreBest pregnancy pillow for leg support:Snüz SnuzCurve pregnancy support pillowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The Guardian£84.95 at Snüz£84.95 at AmazonThe innovation of this maternity pillow is its dual fillings: the upper part is a sausage-style pillow filled with polystyrene beads (à la the Bbhugme), while the lower section has a firmer foam filling. For what Snüz claims is the perfect pregnancy sleeping position, snuggle the upper part in your arms and under your bump, then place the foam part between your legs.Why we love itThe pillow’s shape felt very supportive, and the mix of bead and foam fillings provided the best of both worlds. The beaded portion was comfy to cuddle and moulded nicely around my bump.Meanwhile, the lower portion did a particularly good job of keeping my legs separated and supporting me in a side-sleeping position. A bumper for the knees (Snüz calls a “KneeBlade”) helped hold it in place through the night. Keeping your legs separated can help relieve pressure from the pelvis, hips and back – so if you’re experiencing pelvic girdle pain or similar discomfort, this could be a strong choice.It’s a shame that …the SnuzCurve is designed to keep you in one position, so it may not be the best if you’re a wriggler. It’s only available with either a grey or white cover – the latter seems destined to show every mark.Suitable for:pregnancyShape:C-shapedSize:135 x 30 x 25cmFilling material:polystyrene beads; polyurethane foamCover material:92% cotton, 8% elastaneBest for temperature control:Simba extra support body pillowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The Guardian£109 at Simba SleepThe unique selling point of this C-shaped pillow from mattress brand Simba is its cooling effect. The cotton cover contains the brand’s Stratos “cool-touch” technology, which aims to draw heat away from the body. The shape is a gentle curve designed to support bump, hips and knees when sleeping on your side.Why we love itThe Simba pillow absolutely delivered on its temperature-regulating promise – it stayed cool to the touch, even after a full night’s sleep during a surprise spring heatwave. Given that pregnant women can be prone to hot flushes, night sweats and overall higher body temperatures, anything that can help combat overheating is a boon for night-time comfort.While fairly bulky and lacking any adjustable features, the pillow was comfortable, and the fairly firm, down-like filling offered good support, especially for the hips.It’s a shame that …the cover fabric, while cooling, isn’t the softest to snuggle up against, and the pillow lacks flexibility in shape and firmness.Suitable for:pregnancy and nursingShape:C-shapedSize:120 x 35cmFilling material:combed recycled PET bottle fibresCover material:cotton with Stratosskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It’s a C-shaped pillow: you position the long section along either your front or back, then place one curved end under your head and the other between your legs. Its secret power is two hidden zips that allow the curved ends to detach and then zip together, forming a smaller, half-doughnut shape to support breastfeeding or use as support for your baby.It didn’t make the final cut because …while the BellaMoon pillow is described as medium firmness, I found it too firm, particularly under my head. This also made it unwieldy to reposition during the night and created a bulky barrier in the bed.Suitable for:pregnancy and nursing;shape:C-shaped;size:140 x 50 x 20cm;filling material:100% polyester;cover material:100% organic cottonBabybub Bub’smaternitypillowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The Guardian£39.99 at BabybubBest for:small spacesThe Babybub is a wedge-shaped pillow that’s really more like two wedges: one to support your back and one to support your bump. It also comes with a small cylindrical pillow that can be added to the front or back as needed.Its winged design makes the Babybub much smaller than a traditional pregnancy pillow – you might even call it compact. It took a bit of fiddling with the adjustable Velcro strap to get the wedges the perfect distance apart, but this means you can reposition them as your bump grows.It didn’t make the final cut because …the bamboo and polyester blend cover is slightly scratchy to the touch, and the off-white colour gets grubby easily and looks a little “orthopaedic aid”. I was also quite nonplussed by the additional mini-pillow, which I found inevitably ended up somewhere tangled in the duvet.Suitable for:pregnancy;shape:wedge;size:36 x 46 x 10cm;filling material:polyester and microfibre balls;cover material:bamboo and polyester blendCushy PuffpregnancypillowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The Guardian£135 at ScandibornBest for:colour optionsCurrently dominating my Instagram feed, the Cushy Puff is another microbead-filled sausage in the style of the Bbhugme. As such, it effectively adapts to support your body where you need it. The cotton-jersey pillowcase comes in bold colours and statement stripes and simply ties off at either end – letting you adjust it for firmness by tightening or loosening the knots.It didn’t make the final cut because …the tying mechanism was a bit of a faff. My pillow also gave off a slight chemical odour when first unboxed – off-putting to someone with a heightened sense of smell during pregnancy.Suitable for:pregnancy and nursing;shape:I-shaped;size:120-150 x 25cm;filling material:EPS (expanded polystyrene) microbeads;cover material:95% cotton, 5% spandex jerseyBabymoov Dream BeltpregnancysleepsupportView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The Guardian£33.40 at AmazonBest for:travelA novel wearable concept, the Babymoov Dream Belt fastens around your waist with an adjustable Velcro strap so it moves with you. The stretchy jersey front panel goes over your bump, while memory foam pads sit on the hips to provide bump support when sleeping on your side. I found the belt comfortable to wear, and it stayed in place well, offering support through plenty of tossing and turning.The most compact pillow tested, this would be a good option for travel – and it comes at a reasonable price.It didn’t make the final cut because …the Dream Belt offers support only around your bump, so its usefulness is limited. You could pair with another pillow (or regular cushions) to add leg and back supports.Suitable for:pregnancy;shape:belt;size:available in two body sizes, XS/S and M/XL;filling material:polyurethane memory foam;cover material:95% cotton, 5% elastaneWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Turk/The GuardianPregnancy pillow shapesAs you can tell from the variety above, pregnancy pillows come in different shapes. Which you choose is down to personal preference and the kind of support you’re looking for. Common shapes include C, U, V and wedge pillows.C-shaped pillowssupport your front (or back), head and legs;U-shaped pillowsenvelop the body and so offer support on all sides;V-shaped pillowscan be used in various ways, including one leg of the V supporting your bump and the other going through your legs (like a C-shaped pillow without the head support).When choosing a shape, also consider how much bed space it requires: U-shaped pillows are typically the largest.Wedge-shaped pillowsare usually smaller, wedging under bump or back, but this also limits how much of your body they support. Some pillows, such as theI-shaped pillowswith microbead fillings, offer much more flexibility for you to bend them into different shapes.How to sleep with a pregnancy pillowThis will depend on the shape of the pillow you choose, your support needs and your sleeping position. The NHS recommends sleeping on your side after 28 weeks of pregnancy, and many pillows are designed with this in mind.Longer pillows that go along the front of your body (I, C or U shapes) are usually intended to be cuddled: place one arm and one leg under the pillow, and one on top. At the end of the day, the point of the pillow is comfort, so anything that brings relief and helps you sleep is a plus. Of course, if you’re having any issues with pain or pregnancy symptoms, or are unsure if a pillow is a good idea for you, you should seek medical advice.Features to look forWhen choosing a pregnancy pillow, you’ll want to consider the type of filling (eg microbeads, hollow fibre, memory foam) and the fabric of the cover. Most pillows have removable, washable covers. You may want to choose a pillow that can double as a nursing aid to get extra value out of the product after your baby arrives; some pillows offer specific mechanisms to reshape them for this purpose.Victoria Turk is atechnology journalist whose work has brought her into contact with the latest gadgets and gizmos for the past decade.

In her statement to MPs, Reeves reminded them that Nigel Farage, the party’s leader, had described Liz Truss’s disastrous mini budget as “the best Conservative budget since the 1980s”.She said Reform was “itching to do the same thing all over again” and had alreadyracked up £80bn in unfunded spending commitmentssince the last election. “They are simply not serious,” she said.In response to a threat from the right, the chancellor made a high-stakes promise tocut spending on asylum hotels by the end of the parliament, which she said would save £1bn. There was also £280m more a year for the new Border Security Command.But the Home Office will receive a budget cut that will extend beyond the asylum savings, causing alarm from police officers and the London mayor, Sadiq Khan.The government set out its version of Elon Musk’s “Doge” efficiency pledges, suggesting they would make cuts of £14bn to through operational improvements, digital transformation, cutting consultants and implementing AI.Despite free school meals being expanded to at least 500,000 more pupils, lifting 100,000 out of poverty, school budgets will be squeezed. Teachers will get a 4% pay rise next year via additional funding of £615m but schools will have to fund about a quarter of it themselves.The spending review marked the culmination of months of discussions between Reeves and her cabinet colleagues. Negotiations with the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, went down to the wire.In recent days, ministers announced £15bn fortransport outside London, £14.2bn to build anew nuclear power stationand an increase that will almost double government spendingon affordable housingto nearly £40bn over the next 10 years.After months of speculation over the government’s commitment to net zero, Reeves confirmedministers would not cut Labour’s landmark £13.2bn fund to fix draughty homes.Reeves drew a comparison with the 2.9% cut in the austerity years under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition – a retort to her critics who have accused her of a return to austerity.“Austerity was a destructive choice for the fabric of our society, and it was a destructive choice for our economy, too, choking off investment and demand,” she said. “Creating a lost decade for growth, wages and living standards – that is their legacy. My choices are different. My choices are Labour choices.”Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, hailed the “genuinely big sums” the chancellor had set aside for infrastructure projects, but warned that some departments’ day-to-day spending plans look tight.“The funding increases for health and defence are substantial. The corollary, of course, is a less generous settlement elsewhere,” he said.View image in fullscreen‘Spend-now, tax-later review’: Shadow chancellor Mel Stride picked holes in Labour’s spending review.Photograph: House of Commons/AFP/Getty ImagesReeves changed her fiscal rules in last autumn’s budget to pave the way for a £113bn uplift in investment spending, and Wednesday’s statement set out details of where this funding will be allocated – much of it aimed outside London and the south-east.Beneficiaries include green energy, social housing and transport. The Treasury hopes such projects will create jobs (including in deprived areas), help to make the UK’s sluggish economy more productive, and kickstart growth.As well as changing Treasury rules to support investment in England’s regions, the spending review provides £52bn for Scotland, £20bn for Northern Ireland and £23bn for Wales.“We are renewing Britain. But I know that too many people in too many parts of our country are yet to feel it,” Reeves said. “My task as chancellor and the purpose of this spending review is to change that. To ensure that renewal is felt in people’s everyday lives, in their jobs, and on their high streets.”As the chancellor insisted she would stick to her fiscal rules – including meeting day-to-day spending through tax receipts – experts warned that any economic shock could push her plans off course.Andrew Goodwin, chief economist at consultancy Oxford Economics, said: “Considering the government’s recent U-turn on winter fuel payments could be a precursor to higher government spending in other areas, it looks increasingly likely that substantial tax increases will be needed.”Ruth Curtice, director of the Resolution Foundation, said: “After a summer of spending, the budget this autumn will be far more challenging. The economic outlook is looking weaker – not stronger – since the spring, and that will require more tax rises or welfare cuts for the chancellor to meet her fiscal rules.”The shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, called it a “spend-now, tax-later review”, adding that Reeves “knows she will need to come back here in the autumn with yet more taxes and a cruel summer of speculation awaits”.Explore more on these topicsSpending review 2025Rachel ReevesLabourTax and spendingHousingNHSTransport policynewsShareReuse this content"

They’ll be put into a house that our people need.”But that sentiment was not felt by everyone in Morley – theWest Yorkshireconstituency where Reform UK’s Andrea Jenkyns, then a Tory, surprisingly beat the then shadow chancellor Ed Balls in a general election a decade ago. The seat, after a boundary change, is now held by Labour’s Mark Sewards, Morley born and raised, who won 44% of the vote last year, making it a stronghold.Robert Barrett, a retired factory engineer who lives with his Gambian wife and two children in south Leeds, said: “We need cheaper housing that poorer people can afford, especially single people with children.View image in fullscreenRobert Barrett, a former Labour voter, said he felt there was little difference between Labour and the Tories now.Photograph: Gary Calton/The Guardian“It puts people in debt and makes people have a difficult life. That’s one thing I do feel strongly about. Wealthier people are buying up homes on buy-to-let mortgages and putting rents up. They see people as cows to be milked. That’s something we’ve got to push back on.”Barrett was pleased to hear of more funding for apprenticeships – something he did when he was young – and mentioned that after the cold war he lost his job when the factory he had worked in making lorry axles for the defence industry closed down.So a boost in defence spending would be good? “No. In those days we had a moral defence. Now we’re not on the right side [with the UK’s support for Israel].”Barrett, also a former Labour supporter, said he was turning towards the Greens or the Workers’ party and felt like there was little difference between Keir Starmer’s party and the Tories.“I’m annoyed at how the working class has been treated,” he said.Jake Tilly, a musician busking on the high street, was wary to say whether he was happy with the announcement without seeing the details, citing similar reservations about Labour. “On the surface, it sounds good. It’s not the Tories. Keir Starmer is not technically a Tory. But the cut to Pip makes you think.”View image in fullscreenJake TillyPhotograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianPlans to restrict eligibility for personal independence payments (Pip), the main disability benefit, are being consulted on, which could mean thousands of disabled people lose their benefits from November next year.Spending review 2025: who are the winners and losers?Read moreThough the newly approved West Yorkshire tram network will not come to Morley – it will go through the chancellor’s constituency of Leeds West – wider funding for local transport could benefit people in the town.Funding for local transport was much needed, Tilly said. “There’s only one bus, the 200, that I use, and it feels like they just cancel one for fun every day. More consistency in buses would be great – particularly knowing I can get back on a night.”Tilly, a former Labour supporter who voted Lib Dem at the most recent general election, wanted to see a party on the left learn lessons from Nigel Farage’s Reform.“What is it that Farage is doing for the right?

However, the chancellor’s spending review said the company would share this funding with a separate body tasked with spearheading Britain’s nuclear renaissance.Great British Energy’s budget has been nukedRead moreThe Treasury’s spending plans said the “two allied publicly owned companies with a shared mission” would spend the £8.3bn on “homegrown clean power” including £2.5bn to help the UK develop a new generation of small modular nuclear reactors.The day before the spending review the government quietly renamed Great British Nuclear, which was set up by Boris Johnson’s government in July 2023, as Great BritishEnergy– Nuclear. But despite the name change the two bodies remain separate entities.A nuclear industry source said Great British Nuclear was renamed soLabourcould “make the manifesto commitment add up”.Another nuclear industry source said they expected that the name change would in time lead the nuclear company to be “folded into” GB Energy entirely, although others argued the two bodies would remain separate.The move has ignited a row between the government’s officials and GB Energy over the need to share funds that were promised to the newly established energy company.GB Energy was launched to great fanfare, with itschair, Jürgen Maier, pledgingthat it would become a major power generator, running its own windfarms, tidal power and carbon capture schemes.A source close to GB Energy said Reeves had in effect “restricted” its scope by depriving it of funds that could have gone to renewable energy projects.GB Energy will now be left with about £6bn of capital to invest, of which two-thirds is earmarked for “financial transactions” – loans, equity investments or guarantees to the private sector – which are likely to be tightly overseen by the Treasury, potentially further curbing its independence.The move follows months of simmering tensions at the heart of government involving the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, and the Treasury, plus GB Energy and Maier, a former Siemens UK chief executive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In March, the party set out plans for GB Energy to “absorb the functions of Great British Nuclear” as one of the company’s priorities.In separate strategy documents, Labour said it was exploring how the two bodies could “best work together, including considering how Great British Nuclear functions can be aligned with Great British Energy”.A Whitehall source said: “This has always been part of our plans, but I think perhaps not everyone was paying attention.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy industrySpending review 2025Nuclear powerLabourRachel ReevesEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t want to give them the keys back – they don’t know how to drive”.Keir Starmer’s Labour will be hoping to be able to make a similar pitch to British voters in four years’ time: warning against returning the keys to the Conservatives while also suggesting that Reform UK would land the country in an equally messy economic predicament.Labour’s first multi-year spending review on Wednesday presented a perfect opportunity to emphasise, despite the government’s rather bumpy first year in office, what is considers to be the clear dividing lines with the two rightwing parties.First among these is the decision to allocate a huge £113bn extra in capital spending, funded through borrowing after changes to the chancellor’s “iron clad” fiscal rules at the autumn budget.Labour promised people we would rebuild Britain – and that’s what we’re doing | Keir StarmerRead moreIn the days running up to the spending review, ministers announced £15bn fortransport outside London, £14.2bnto build a new nuclear power stationand an almost doubling of government spending – nearly £40bn –on affordable housingover the next 10 years.Politicians are often criticised for focusing too much on short-term outcomes, with one eye always on the next election. “One of the central failures of the last 14 years was the failure to invest in our country when interest rates were low,” said one government insider.Investment is harder with a difficult fiscal backdrop. But ministers believe that it is needed not only to restore the public realm – schools, hospitals, railways, housing – but also as a display of confidence that will encourage private investment, and help to deliver the holy grail: growth.Graphs showing sector spendingDespite Reeves’s insistence the economy has improved, pointing to the interest rate cut and wage increases as justification for now taking a different approach to spending, the backdrop of anaemic growth and rising unemployment suggest the sunlit uplands are still some way off.Starmer told his cabinet on Wednesday the government was entering a “new phase” that would deliver on the promises it has made to working people. Reeves emphasised that she recognised attempts for “national renewal” were yet to be felt by the public.Officials say both the prime minister and chancellor know the government has to deliver, or it will die. “People didn’t elect a Labour government just to sort out public finances,” one No 10 insider said. “We have to do more. We have to set out what this change will look out.”But for all the extra investment in infrastructure, the changes that will follow are years away. While new homes, power stations and transport links are now on their way, the most the public will see by the next election will be spades in the ground.There are some exceptions, and they are not insubstantial ones. Capital spending on the NHS, for example, means more scanners and technology that will lead to greater productivity. In turn, that will help drive down waiting lists, a key manifesto pledge.But the risk for the government is that most voters’ interactions with the state come through public services – schools, the police, local councils – which have been hit by extremely tight settlements for day-to-day spending.Bar showing increase in spending per sectorReal-terms spending will grow at an average of 1.2% a year over three years, after taking inflation into account, a significant drop from the first two years, when it will be 2.5%. Defence and the NHS have been the big winners, meaning some departments, such as the Home Office, face deep cuts.The Treasury denies this is a return to austerity – pointing to a 2.3% overall real-terms increase for departmental budgets, compared with the Tories cutting them by 2.9% in 2010, leading to a decade of public services being pushed to the brink.And so over the coming days, ministers will attempt to refocus anxious Labour backbenchers away from cuts in day-to-day spending, and back on to capital budgets, with further big announcements expected.They may struggle to restore calm for long, with more difficult decisions coming down the line, including over benefit cuts and potential tax rises in the autumn budget to pay for U-turns on winter fuel and perhaps even the two-child limit being scrapped.The government has an uphill task. Standing at the dispatch box, Reeveschannelled David Cameronwhen she told the Commons: “I have made my choices. In place of chaos, I choose stability. In place of decline, I choose investment. In place of retreat, I choose national renewal.”Yet her own colleagues remain jittery, worried that the promised renewal will not come quickly enough to see off the Reform threat, or a resurgent Tory party, with a battle on how to frame the spending review ahead.“We all welcome the billions put into capital spending, the country desperately needs it,” says one minister. “But the danger is that it comes too late, and the public doesn’t see enough change before the next election, and decide to give the keys to No 10 elsewhere instead.”Explore more on these topicsSpending review 2025LabourRachel ReevesKeir StarmerPublic services policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Get those diggers digging forsocial purposeand growth, with rail, trams, insulated homes and much more. That £39bn for social housing stretches for a 300,000 new homes per year target, not reached for half a century.Meanwhile, it’s a win-win for net zero, with billions for macho nuclear plants trouncing anti-net zero, climate-denying Tories and Reform, who think windmills are for wimps.This£113bn capital spendingstory at last sounds solidly Labour. The facts on the ground are good, but a richer narrative of social justice is still missing. Borrowing rules are changing to permit capital spending, but why not invest in human capital, when nothing can be built without human skills?The chancellor’s shower of gold needs a sprinkle of political fairy dust: “renewal” sounds like repairs, but Labour’s messaging needs to lift hearts and hopes. Those spades need to be in the ground fast to kickstart growth, to ensure people give Labour the credit it deserves for ending austerity.Defence gets its necessary catapult, protecting us and undersea cables, but its vital purpose is to bind us back politically into the lost Europe we rashly departed. Health gets an unexpectedly bigger fillip, but at 40%, let that be the maximum proportion of GDP. No more growth in spending on the old, while schools get very little. Long-term thinking needs to reverse those priorities, tilting the balance towards the young and the future. Let the autumn’schild poverty taskforcedo that, with a strong social democratic message to sharpen Labour’s legend.A housing crisis ‘solution’ based on a fallacyKirsty MajorDeputy Opinion editor for the GuardianRachel Reeves’s headline-grabbing pledge of £39bn for affordable and social housing is based on one big assumption: that the housing crisis is caused by a lack of supply.By increasing the number of homes, the logic goes, prices will be pushed down, and the crisis of affordability will be solved. The funding comes in addition to changes toplanning regulationsaimed at boosting housebuilding across the country. By putting shovels in the ground, the chancellor hopes to solve two problems at once – putting keys in hands and boosting economic growth. A neat solution, right?Well, it would be if Britain’s housing crisis was a supply-side problem. But it is not. If you don’t believe me, just ask the OBR. This spring the body predicted that these changes to planning policy could bring house prices down by only0.8%by 2029. The average UK house price is£271,415– this means it would drop to £269,243. It’s not nothing, but it’s far from something.Demand in the UK has been artificially inflated since the 1980s by a mix of lending rules relaxation and pressure from buy-to-let landlords and foreign investors. There is no point in affordable housing – housing sold at a percentage of the market rate – if the market rate goes up. Yes, families will be able to leave emergency accommodation and have roofs over their heads, and some private renters might be able move into housing association accommodation. This is to be celebrated in the short term. But there is no point in more council housing if waiting lists keep going up because rents in the private sector continue to rise. There is no point in more houses if people can’t afford to buy them.Labour’srenters’ rights billmay go some way to easing some of this demand. Proposals beingfloatedto loosen mortgage lending will not. We will have to wait and see how these policies play out in the housing market. As things stand, the new funding is a step in the right direction, but by no means the solution.Substantial spending – but not for the manySahil DuttaLecturer in political economyBy the raw numbers alone, Labour can saythisis no return to austerity. The government, after all, will dole out billions for capital projects, and day-to-day NHS spending will rise. But for many, it won’t feel that way.Because the lived reality of austerity was never just about spending in the aggregate. It was about who and what we prioritised as a society. Money was stripped from the young, the sick, the poor, the arts, education and local government. Workers and regions of “low productivity” sectors decayed, while riches were showered on the already wealthy.In its fixation on the fantasy of high economic growth, Labour is unable to fully break from that. Instead, it has concentrated fiscal largesse on high-productivity sectors in the hope that this amounts to an industrial strategy. Investing in tech, R&D and AI will always sound impressive. But the sector is awash with cash already – what it lacks is a useful purpose and proper regulation. Likewise, whatever the geopolitical context, there is little evidence that military-industrial spending is an efficient way to boost employment and growth, or improve people’s lives. More promising is the extra funding for affordable housing. Yet under-resourced councils could struggle to contain the predatory costs of private building contractors.There was once a time when Rachel Reeves spoke about the importance of the everyday economy, but from the military to tech to construction companies, it is the commanding heights of the private sector who should be happiest today.‘Treasury brain’ still reignsDhananjayan SriskandarajahChief executive of the New Economics FoundationCapital spending alone won’t improve people’s living standards. The extra investment may mean we can build more homes, renewable energy, public transport and other vital infrastructure. Despite her hopes that this will rejuvenate our economy in the years to come, we also need urgent action to improve people’s lives today.There was lots of talk of security – 17 mentions in the speech, no less – but I fear with the diversion of funds to defence spending, the chancellor is overlooking household economic security as a lever for growth. Unless we also boost day-to-day spending in key departments, living standards will continue to decline. Indeed, keeping the two-child benefit cap and slashing support for disabled people is making millions of people feel less secure. Investing in social infrastructure will improve lives almost immediately and have just as great long-term effects.On days like this, it is clear that the government has fallen victim to “Treasury brain”, clouded by outdated and arbitrary fiscal rules that it has set itself. Instead it should find better ways to assess safe borrowing levels, and tax wealth in line with other forms of income so we can tackle poverty, reduce inequality and protect our planet.Families like mine have been left with more questions than answersJonny RobertsSingle parent, working part-time, who takes part inChanging Realities,a collaboration of almost 200 parents on a low income working with researchers at the University of YorkThe chancellor’s speech today marked a welcome change in tone about the future – less focus on economic misery, heavier on hope and investment. But what I and the millions of parents like me, struggling with costs, needed to hear more about is how Reeves’s vision actually converts into reality.How will the promise to make sure “every child has the chance to thrive” be realised? Especially when there was nothing in this spending review on ending the two-child benefit limit or providing support for families in poverty through investing in social security, all the more ominous when Department for Work and Pensions spending is scheduled to contract by 0.2%.What will the (excellent) expansion of free school meals to all universal credit claimants mean for extended support in-school via the pupil premium? And when will the free breakfast clubs, which have started in 750 schools, be rolled out everywhere?The chancellor opened by noting that people want to feel change in their communities. Last week,Changing Realities and PPRset out a series of measures that would make real inroads into tackling the economic hardship faced by families like mine. Today we are still left waiting in anxious anticipation of the budget and child poverty strategy this autumn, and in the hope of real change, which simply must come.‘Mission-driven’ government was left behind in this spending reviewHannah WhiteDirector and chief executive of the Institute for GovernmentLabour’s manifesto, which won the party the election, was built on the concept of “mission-driven” government. This included five long-term, cross-cutting objectives – the NHS, safer streets, net zero, opportunity for all and economic growth.In today’s spending review, the headline strategy is different,with the chancellor instead focusing on three priorities – health, economy and security. This means the mission-leading health and net zero departments get some of the most generous settlements, and economic infrastructure and housebuilding are prioritised. But the two remaining missions, safer streets and opportunity for all, have done less well for now.The spending review falls short of using missions as “a new way of doing government” by making spending decisions focused on outcomes – as the manifesto promised.The idea was that having objectives that cut across the silos of government departments would drive greater collaboration and better value for money. Groups of ministers for each mission did work together on spending plans, but this has not translated into shared budgets, outcomes or efficiency targets that they will be jointly responsible for delivering.The spending review has been the first serious test of Labour’s approach to organising government, but so far this seems to be more about allocating budgets than anything more innovative.Explore more on these topicsSpending review 2025The panelEconomic policyRachel ReevesEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

British military facilities in Gibraltar will remain operationally autonomous.However, it will apply Schengen rules to Britons arriving in Gibraltar who are not resident there. This means they could be turned away at the border if they have already spent 90 days in the Schengen zone over a 180-day period.David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, said the deal was “a practical solution after years of uncertainty” and that the UK’s commitment to Gibraltar “remains as solid as the Rock itself”.Will the UK ‘give up’ Gibraltar next? In Spain, we’re more worried about Brexit’s absurdities | María RamírezRead moreJosé Manuel Albares, the Spanish foreign affairs minister, and Fabian Picardo, the chief minister of Gibraltar, hailed it as a “historic agreement” in posts on Bluesky and X.Lammy, Picardo and Albares unveiled the deal in Brussels on Wednesday afternoonafter talks by ministers from Britain and Gibraltar earlier in the day.Talks about the borderhave been held on and offsinceBritain exited the European Union in 2020, which left Gibraltar outside the EU customs union and without guaranteed freedom of movement.An estimated 15,000 people cross the land border every day, including thousands of workers who live inSpainbut work in Gibraltar.At present, Gibraltar residents can cross using residence cards without having their passports stamped, and Spanish citizens can cross using a government ID card. The deal aims to prevent a hard border from being imposed under new EU rules.The agreement establishes a system where British and Spanish border officers will carry out passport checks at Gibraltar’s port and airport. This will mirror the system in place for Eurostar travellers at St Pancras station in London, where travellers go through British and French passport control before boarding trains to the continent.Spanish border police, based at Gibraltar’s port and airport, could refuse access to a UK citizen who has broken Schengen rules, such as staying longer than 90 days during a 180-day period without a visa. This may prove unpopular with rightwing opposition parties in the UK.At a press conference in Brussels on Wednesday afternoon, Albares called the agreement a new beginning in relations between Spain and the UK that brought down “the last wall” on the continent.“With this agreement, the barrier will disappear. That’s the last wall on continentalEurope, and we will guarantee free movement of persons and goods. Gibraltar will be linked to the Schengen area, and Spain will control entry and exit,” he said.Keir Starmer spoke with Picardo to congratulate him, a spokesperson for the prime minister said.They added: “He thanked him for his years of hard work, commitment and leadership to reach an agreement, adding that it was fantastic to see that it had been profusely welcomed by all sides.Gibraltar’s government and FA criticise Spain players’ chants at Euro 2024 partyRead more“Both agreed that this would unlock a secure future for the people and businesses of Gibraltar, allowing them to plan for the long-term while protecting British sovereignty.”The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, congratulated Starmer, as “his government had succeeded where others had failed”.No 10 added: “Both leaders also agreed that this development unlocks huge opportunity to advance the bilateral relationship between the UK and Spain, on behalf of the British and Spanish people.”Priti Patel, the UK’s shadow foreign secretary, said: “Gibraltar is British, and given Labour’s record of surrendering our territory and paying for the privilege, we will be reviewing carefully all the details of any agreement that is reached.”Gibraltar has made concessions on taxation, including on tobacco. Spain has been calling for the territory to stop exempting tobacco from VATamid EU concerns about smuggling.Maroš Šefčovič, the EU commissioner in charge of UK relations, told reporters that the agreement was a “truly historic milestone for theEuropean Union, including Spain, as well as for the United Kingdom”.Brokered less than one month after the EU-UK summit in London last month, Šefčovič said the latest deal reinforced “a new chapter in our [EU-UK] relationship”, adding that there was “no alternative given today’s realities and challenges”.Negotiators will now focus on finalising the legal text to prepare it for ratification.Gibraltar is aBritish overseas territoryon the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula. It has been ruled by Britain since 1713 but is self-governing in all areas except defence and foreign policy.Spainclaims sovereignty over the territory, but Gibraltar’s 1969 constitution states there can be no transfer of sovereignty to Spain against the wishes of locals. In a 2002 referendum, 99% of people in Gibraltar rejected a proposal to share sovereignty with Spain.Explore more on these topicsGibraltarForeign policyBrexitSpainEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We are at a loss for words right now. Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world. Love & Mercy.”Brian Wilson: a life in picturesRead moreAs the leading creative force in theBeach Boys,Wilsoncrafted a variously carefree and melancholy sound that came to define the uncertain utopianism of mid-century California. Using ambitious studio techniques to give the band’s music a thrilling grandeur, his songs about surfing, driving, girls and the pep of youth modulated to more reflective and often psychedelic material, resulting in one of the most highly regarded catalogues of American song. The Beach Boys’ 1966 album Pet Sounds – written and produced almost entirely by Wilson – is seen not only as the group’s masterpiece, but for many is the greatest album of all time.Wilson was born in Inglewood, southern California, in 1942. A natural musician with perfect pitch who could sing back phrases sung to him as a baby, he learned piano as he and his younger brothers Carl and Dennis fell in love with R&B, rock’n’roll, doo-wop and pop. Despite going partly deaf in one ear (possibly as a result of an attack by a local boy), he and Carl joined their cousin Mike Love to form the high school group Carl and the Passions, later bringing in Dennis and friend Al Jardine to form the Pendletones. They had been encouraged by Wilson’s father Murry, with whom Wilson had a complex relationship – he later said Murry was also physically abusive to him.Wilson’s first song for the group, soon renamed theBeach Boys, was 1961’s Surfin’ – the first in a series of Wilson-penned hits such as Surfin’ Safari, Surfer Girl and Surfin’ USA, the latter reaching No 3 on the US charts and cementing their breakthrough.View image in fullscreenThe Beach Boys in 1964.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesWilson graduated to producer, as well as songwriter, for third album Surfer Girl, and powered the group through an astonishingly high work rate, releasing 15 albums before the end of the 1960s. Wilson’s ambition meant that he strove not to be boxed in as a novelty band who sang about surfing and cars, and deepened the band’s songcraft – including on Pet Sounds, which was conceived as an overarching statement rather than a series of discrete songs, its complex arrangements featuring everything from orchestral instruments to Coca-Cola bottles.Wilson began using cannabis and LSD, and said the latter was creatively useful – he wrote a signature Beach Boys song, California Girls, while on his first trip, and said acid allowed him to “come to grips with what you are, what you can do [and] can’t do”. But his drug use, coupled with his intense workload, likely exacerbated mental health problems that had started when he was a teenager suffering from anxiety.He heard voices in his head, spent time in psychiatric hospitals during the late 1960s, and became somewhat isolated from his bandmates. Wilson would eventually be diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and mild manic depression. He said in 2019: “There were times when [his mental illness] was unbearable but with doctors and medications I have been able to live a wonderful, healthy and productive life.”The Beach Boys’ 40 greatest songs – ranked!Read moreAmid his difficulties, Pet Sounds’ follow-up Smile was never completed (though was later adapted into a 2004 solo album, and the original recordings eventually released as The Smile Sessions in 2011). His bandmates began to contribute more to the songwriting, though Wilson compositions still occasionally featured as the group emerged from a commercial downturn at the close of the decade to record the acclaimed Sunflower and Surf’s Up albums (the latter’s title track a psychedelic return by Wilson to his earlier fixation).View image in fullscreenBrian Wilson in the studio.After the death of his father, the early 70s were a low period for Wilson, as his drug intake increased and he became isolated once more. He came back into the Beach Boys fold for 1976 album 15 Big Ones, but descended again into alcoholism, drug abuse and overeating towards the end of the decade; he also endured the death of Dennis who drowned in 1983. Closely controlled by psychologist Eugene Landy, his equilibrium improved in the 1980s, and, having finally split from the Beach Boys, he released his self-titled debut solo album in 1988.The early 1990s was another fractious period: Wilson was extricated from his arrangement with Landy – who had become a songwriting collaborator, and got himself added to Wilson’s will via a conservatorship agreement – with a restraining order filed against Landy. Wilson was sued by his mother, Carl, Love and Jardine for defamatory statements in his 1991 memoir, and again by Love the following year over royalties, which was found in favour of Love.Wilson continued to tour and release occasional solo albums, and eventually reunited with the Beach Boys in 2011 (now without Carl, who died in 1998) for a tour and the album That’s Why God Made the Radio. The group split once more, with Love touring under the band’s name and Wilson and Jardine separately touring together, including for a 50th anniversary Pet Sounds tour in 2016.Wilson sold his publishing rights to Universal for $50m in 2021 and played his final concert as part of a joint tour with Chicago a year later. In 2024, it wasannouncedthat Wilson had dementia and months later a judgeplacedhim in conservatorship.Wilson was married twice, first to Marilyn Rovell in 1964, with whom he had two daughters, Carnie and Wendy (who later formed a vocal group of their own, Wilson Phillips, and scored three US No 1 singles). Wilson and Rovell divorced in 1979. In 1995, he married Melinda Kae Ledbetter, who he first began dating in 1986 and who also became his manager. They adopted five children together.

On TuesdayIsraeli troops killed 17 Palestiniansaround GHF sites.The bodies of two Israeli hostages were recovered from Gaza by the army and the internal security service, Shin Bet. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, issued a statement naming one of the dead hostages as Yair Yaakov, a 59-year-old father of three who was abducted and killed byHamasin its 7 October 2023 attack in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and triggered the conflict. Netanyahu said the second hostage whose remains were recovered, could not yet be named.There are thought to be 53 Israelis hostages still in Gaza, but most are believed to be dead.The Gaza health authorities said on Wednesday the Palestinian death toll over the 20 months of conflict had passed 55,000. The health ministry was part of the Hamas government but is staffed by medical professionals and its statistics are regarded as reliable by the UN and other global organisations.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In recent days, more and more of the fatalities have been associated with GHF food distribution. On Wednesday, a New York-based law group, the Center for Constitutional Rights, warned the GHF of its “potential legal liability for complicity in Israel’s war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide against Palestinians”.“As Palestinians now face mass starvation, Israel has teamed up with GHF to make accessing food not only dangerous and potentially deadly but also a tool of forced displacement,” its senior staff attorney, Katherine Gallagher, said. “If GHF continues its militarised aid operations, it must be prepared to face the legal consequences, whether in the United States or beyond.”The Israeli government and armed forces are now under scrutiny by the international court of justice on allegations of genocide, in part because of the alleged use of food as a weapon against the occupied territory’s 2.2 million people.Humanitarian experts had previously warned that the GHF scheme or distributing food from a restricted number of heavily militarised siteswould be highly dangerous for people seeking food, forcing them to cross combat zones.The organisation’s first executive director, Jake Wood,resigned last month, saying its plan ran counter to “humanitarian principles”.Last week, a US consulting firm, Boston Consulting Group which had helped set up the GHF, severed ties with the organisation. Johnnie Moore, an evangelical leader and religious adviser to Donald Trump, with a record of outspoken support for Israel and minimal experience of humanitarian work, wasappointed the new chair of the GHF.The Israel Defense Forces said troops had fired “warning shots” overnight towards a group it said posed a threat to them. “This is despite warnings that the area is an active combat zone. The IDF is aware of reports regarding individuals injured; the details are under review,” it said.The GHF told the Reuters news agency it was unaware of Wednesday’s incidents but added that it was working closely with Israeli authorities to ensure safe passage routes are maintained, and that it was essential for Palestinians to closely follow instructions.“Ultimately, the solution is more aid, which will create more certainty and less urgency among the population,” it said.“There is not yet enough food to feed everyone in need in Gaza. Our current focus is to feed as many people as is safely possible within the constraints of a highly volatile environment.”In a social media post, Moore said he had visited a GHF packing and distribution centre in Israel and claimed the organisation provided 2.5 million meals on Wednesday. That would bring the total to 16 million meals distributed in Gaza since it started operations on 27 May.The GHF late on Wednesday accused Hamas of killing at least five people in an attack on a bus carrying two dozen Palestinians working with the aid organization to one of its distribution sites.“We will continue our mission to provide critical aid to the people of Gaza,” it said in a statement.‘We did nothing wrong’: Greta Thunberg accuses Israel of kidnapping yacht crewRead moreAlso on Wednesday, an Israeli civil rights group, Adalah, said that one of an international group of activistsdetained by Israel on a ship in the eastern Mediterranean, was being held in solitary confinement.In a statement it said that a Brazilian protester, Tiago Ávila, was being held in isolation in Ayalon prison “due to his ongoing hunger and thirst strike, which he began two days ago”.Another activist detained on the Madleen protest ship, a French-Palestinian member of the European parliament, Rima Hassan, was temporarily held in solitary confinement, in Neve Tirza prison after writing “Free Palestine” on a cell wall.“She was moved to a small, windowless cell with extremely poor hygienic conditions and has been denied access to the prison yard,” Adalah said. It added that Hassan had been moved out of isolation on Wednesday.

The judge has advised them to continue deliberations.R Kelly files request for release from prison citing murder plot against himRead moreThe verdict delivered against Weinstein follows two earlier convictions on similar charges, one of which was overturned on appeal. In the first, now-vacated New York case, Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison. A second conviction, in California, resulted in a 16-year sentence.Prior to the return of the jury, Weinstein addressed the court and urged the judge to declare a mistrial after several jurors reported tensions in the deliberation room.“This is my life that’s on the line,” Weinstein told Judge Curtis Farber, adding: “I am not getting a fair trial.”Weinstein told the judge: “You are endangering me, Your Honor.”The partial verdict came after almost a week of jury deliberations, at times appearing to be steering the case against Weinstein toward a mistrial.On Wednesday, the jury foreperson requested to speak to the judge about “a situation” he found troubling.“He said words to the effect of ‘I can’t go back in there with the other jurors,’” Farber explained later. The foreperson was sent to wait in a separate room, where he penned a note saying: “I need to talk to you about a situation.”“He did indicate that at least one other juror made comments to the effect of ‘I’ll meet you outside one day,’ and there’s yelling and screaming,” Farber said.1:38'A big win for everyone': Harvey Weinstein accusers express relief after guilty verdict – videoWeinstein lawyer Arthur Aidala characterized the foreperson’s concerns more severely, saying that the man had said he was concerned for his safety after his fellow panelist talked about meeting him outside and added: “You don’t know me.”Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo, however, said the foreperson hadn’t seemed afraid or apprehensive, just “stubborn”.That followed previous messages from the jury room alerting the court to jury discord. On Monday, the foreperson complained that some jurors were pushing others to change their minds. Last week, another juror had said some jurors were being “shunned” by others.In a press conference, Haley said the verdict gives her hope. “Hope that there is new awareness around sexual violence and that the myth of the perfect victim is fading. I hope that this result empowers others to speak out and seek justice.”Sokola called the verdict “a big win for everyone”, and said she hopes that “standing here right now will give courage to others to speak up”.Mann issued a statement after the jury reached a mixed verdict on Haley and Sokola, but were still ordered to continue deliberations on a charge that Weinstein raped her in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.“I would never lie about rape or use something so traumatic to hurt someone. Rape can happen in relationships – and in dynamics where power and manipulation control the narrative.”Mann went on to accuse Weinstein’s legal and PR teams of conducting a smear campaign against her.“Coming forward cost me everything,” she said. “My privacy, my safety. I laid bare my trauma, my shame – everything I’d tried to bury just to keep living. Still, I stood up and told the truth. Again and again.”The case was seen as a test of the legacy of the#MeToo movementthat faded from the spotlight as other, comporting social justice and political movements – including racial justice – took center stage.Weinstein did not testify in his defense at trial, which he has attended in a wheelchair from custody in a Manhattan hospital where he was being treated for leukemia. As in the previous trials, he denied the allegations, saying he believed the interactions with his accusers were consensual.Weinstein was accused of raping Mann, an actor and hairstylist, in 2013, as well as forcing oral sex on Haley, a production assistant and producer, and Sokola, an aspiring actress, both in 2006.All three women testified during the retrial, giving emotional and graphic accounts of their ordeals. Prosecutors contended that Weinstein had used his power in the industry to lure the women with promises of career advancement but had later turned on them sexually, with force, against their consent.Weinstein’s attorneys argued in court that any physical interaction between their client and his accusers was consensual – and offered evidence that the three women had continued friendly relationships with Weinstein after the charged offences occurred.Weinstein’s lawyer, Arthur Aidala, said the Oscar-winning producer and his accusers had a “mutually beneficial” relationship – and they ended up with auditions as well as other show business opportunities.The defense offered testimony from friends of Sokola and Mann who indicated that neither had offered contemporaneous accounts of being assaulted by the defendant and had not said anything was amiss.Mann testified that she never told anyone at the time that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her because she didn’t think she’d be believed, and she was scared about how he might react.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

The analysis also warns that uncertainty over the role and scope of an independent regulator is “unhelpful” to those wishing to join the rush of investors entering the sport.Lisa Nandy removes herself from final decision on leader of football regulatorRead moreThe Annual Review of Football Finance painted an overall picture of a booming industry, pointing out that the European football market was worth a record £32.2bn in 2023-24. More than £16.9bn of that wasgenerated by the “big five” leagues, with the Premier League alone recording revenues of £6.3bn. Deloitte cautioned, though, that those numbers do not tell the full tale of a game caught between its community roots and the requirement for continued growth. “There can be no doubt that the system in English football is under strain,” said Tim Bridge, lead partner at Deloitte sports business group, in the report’s foreword. “Repeated reports of fan unrest at ticket price and accessibility demonstrate the challenge in the modern era of balancing commercial growth with the historic essence of afootball club’s role and position in society: as a community asset.”A bill to create the independent football regulator went through its second reading in parliament last month. It could transform the game’s governance but Bridge cited the gap between Premier Leagueand Championship financesas a problem that must be addressed. “It is clear that the way in which the game is governed and the regulation that underpins it needs to seek to drive value, fan engagement [both physical and digital] and competitive balance,” he said.“The two most recent seasons underscore the challenge, as in each season, all three clubs promoted from the Championship were subsequently relegated after just one season in thePremier League. The financial implications of the ‘yo-yo effect’ on clubs, their spending, and overall competitiveness are major factors to address in order to continue attracting high levels of investment across the system.”The hope is that the regulator can begin its work this autumn, although roadblocks include a likely inquiry into the government’s choice for its chair, David Kogan. Bridge pointed out that the uncertainty about its form rings alarm bells for investors. “The level of interest and the demand to engage with English football remains high and investors still see the opportunity, particularly when there is a strong community link or adjacent investment opportunities, but the lack of clarity over the future regulatory regime is now unhelpful,” he said.He noted that other “big five” leagues – those of France, Germany, Italy and Spain – are monitoring the regulator’s possible effects, seeing it as a potential opportunity to close the financial chasm that has opened between England’s top flight and the rest. The Premier League’s aggregate revenue was almost double the £3.2bn recorded by La Liga, its nearest competitor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The case was seen as extremely damaging to France’s reputation as a world centre for heritage and museum collections. After the police investigation began, in 2016 the ministry of culture ordered an audit of Versailles’s acquisitions policy.Bill Pallot, 61, who was known as the world’s leading expert on 18th-century royal French furniture, wrote the definitive book about seats of that era and was nicknamed Père La Chaise. On Wednesday he was given a four-year suspended prison sentence and a €200,000 fine. He was also sentenced to four months in prison, which he had already served on remand after his arrest.The judges ruled that between 2008 and 2015, Pallot was behind the scam in which he and one of France’s most acclaimed woodcarvers and restorers, Bruno Desnoues, produced what the court in Pontoise heard were “extraordinarily convincing” fake 18th-century chairs.The court was told that the scheme began as a bet between Pallot and Desnoues to see who could be duped by fake seats. Pallot told the trial: “We said we’d do it as a game, to see if the art market noticed or not.”The men used old wooden frames of real 18th-century chairs as a base so that the dating of the wood could be authentic, but the trial was told that everything about the chairs was fake. Soon, through some of Paris’s top galleries and auction houses, the chairs were selling for hundreds of thousands of euros each to wealthy collectors including a Qatari prince. The scam is estimated to have caused €4.5m in damages.Desnoues had previously worked as a restorer of furniture for the Château de Versailles, where he had once been commissioned for a restoration of Louis XVI’s bed. He told the court: “I’m into work and sculpture. I’ve never been passionate about money.”During the investigation, Desnoues’s wife described the antiques world her husband worked in as “a detestable environment where antique dealers want to make money at any cost”. Desnoues was given a three-year suspended prison sentence and a €100,000 fine. He was also given a four-month prison sentence, which he had already served on remand.The scam was discovered in 2014 when tax authorities noticed suspicious financial and property transactions for large sums being made by a couple outside Paris who had a relatively low income. A money-laundering investigation led police to find a link to Desnoues and what became known in France as the “fake chair” scam. The investigation took nine years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His gallery was acquitted of charges of negligence.Several experts told the court that the fraud was “blatant” and could have been spotted if the fakes had been compared with real chairs at Versailles. One expert said anomalies in the chairs were visible to the naked eye, notably the absence of signs that the wood had retracted with time.Pallot told the court: “It’s said there is no such thing as the perfect crime. There’s no such thing as a perfect fake either. We could have done better. We’re not good forgers. We didn’t make the wood retract.”Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

For me, it’s all about the joy, spirit and fearless energy of youth – that feeling like life is one big adventure and the world’s your playground. I hope it inspires you to dream bigger, live louder and hold on to that unapologetic energy that comes with being young.”#Merky Films is also developing a drama series and what it is calling “a seminal biopic that promises to leave a lasting cultural mark”, although the subject of the film is to be confirmed.The company is also working on what it calls “thought-provoking documentaries”, a “bold new animation project” and a “boundary-pushing, new-age mockumentary”.Stormzy will be joined on screen by Klevis Brahja, who was street cast for his part, and Jaydon Eastman, who starred in The Lion King UK and Ireland tour as Young Simba.The news came after Black British film-makers and producers told the Guardian they were “fighting over scraps” amid lack of opportunities, with some claiming conditions are worse now than before the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020.Andy Mundy-Castle, the founder of the indie company Doc Hearts, who won aBaftaand aRoyal Television Society awardin 2024 for the documentaryWhite Nanny, Black Child, said despite critical acclaim it was as difficult as ever to get commissions.“You are so far removed from the top of the food chain that you just get the scraps … we aren’t given the biggest opportunities,” he said.Explore more on these topicsStormzyShort filmsRapnewsShareReuse this content"

Other families have erected union jacks and loyalist bunting in hope of deflecting the crowd’s wrath and avoiding selection.“We put it up yesterday,” said Blanka Harnagea, 38, an immigrant from the Czech Republic, indicating the British flag on her living room window. Was it working? A wry smile. “We’re still here.”View image in fullscreenBlanka Harnagea, a Czech immigrant, and three of her children, and the newly erected union jack, at their home in BallymenaPhotograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianOn a street of scorched, abandoned homes it was a fragile victory because no one knows if therioting that has scarred the Antrim town of Ballymena this weekwill abate or continue and spread to other towns in Northern Ireland.Hundreds of people, many masked and hooded, targeted foreign-owned homes and businesses on Monday and Tuesday in a spree of smashing,burning and missile-throwingthat turned into assaults on police that left 32 officers injured and several properties and vehicles torched.In the House of Commons, Keir Starmer joinedNorthern Irelandpoliticians in condemning the violence and pleading for calm. But foreign residents in Ballymena still grappled with the decision: flee, or hunker down and hope for the best?“The crowd was banging on the door and we were all upstairs,” said David, a 28-year-old Polish man who withheld his surname. Two Polish and Bulgarian families – about 12 people in all – had clustered together for safety and wedged a sofa against the front door when the mob smashed windows and set fire to the living room, he said. “I smelled the smoke. We came down and ran out the back door to the police station.”On Wednesday afternoon the sun shone and debris from the night’s mayhem had been cleared away, but the food processing plant worker and his pregnant girlfriend were packing and preparing to relocate – just for a few days, they hope, but some members of her family wish to return to Bulgaria. “I’m here 14 years, never anything like this,” said David. His voice shook.View image in fullscreenRiots in BallymenaA view shows buildings with barricated windows, following riots in Ballymena.Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/ReutersThe violence erupted on Monday after a vigil for a teenage girl who was allegedly sexually assaulted by two 14-year-old boys. When they appeared in court a Romanian interpreter read them the charge of attempted rape.The vigil was peaceful but when a crowd broke away and started attacking homes occupied by foreigners on Clonavon Road and nearby streets afull-scale riot erupted, drawing police who then bore the brunt of attacks. Liam Kelly, chair of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, said his members had prevented a pogrom. “What we saw was totally mindless, unacceptable and feral.”Some native residents of Ballymena, in contrast, believe it was necessary – an overdue reckoning. Authorities have turned the predominantly Protestant working-class town, 25 miles north-west of Belfast, into a “dumping ground” for immigrants and asylum seekers, they said.“The riots have a valid point; we are being overpopulated,” said Danielle O’Neill, 32. “It sounds like I’m racist but I’m not. It’s like an invasion. I don’t feel safe walking the streets any more. Just yesterday one of them was following me and eyeing me up.”O’Neill credited some arrivals with working hard and creating jobs, but she accused others of criminality – a bane that authorities ignored. “If they can terrorise our kids we can terrorise the town. It’s a way of getting our voices heard.” Her husband, Ryan O’Neill, 33, said residents had to take action against alleged criminals. “If the government won’t put them out, we’ll put them out.”View image in fullscreenRyan and Danielle O’Neill, Ballymena residentsPhotograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianOne resident said rioters – some with paramilitary connections – had ordered householders to deactivate door bell cameras and other devices that might identify those responsible for the mayhem. Proclaiming Filipino nationality has had limited value – at least one Filipino household was targeted and had its car torched.Tyler Hoey, Ballymena’s deputy mayor and a Democratic Unionist party councillor, condemned the violence and said foreigners were welcome but accused the UK government of allowing “busloads” of unvetted people to settle in the town. “Unfettered immigration needs to be addressed.”Dee, 53, a bottling plant worker, said the rioting reflected a belief that new arrivals received lavish state benefits and that police and politicians turned a blind eye to antisocial behaviour.“I’m working my balls off and paying my taxes while they get put up in luxury hotels and the police let them do what they want. It’s a dumping ground. No one cares about us, we’re forgotten.”Dee said he recognised – and welcomed – Catholics from other parts of Ballymena who joined the protests. “They wouldn’t normally be in a loyalist area like this but they came down. It’s a very good thing.”Dee regretted that his immediate neighbours – a Slovak family – had their windows smashed. The previous occupants were “a nightmare” but the Slovaks were “brilliant” and should not have been targeted. “They got hit in the heat of the moment. It was a mistake.” Those responsible had apologised and told the family it could stay, said Dee.On an adjoining street, Harnagea, the Czech mother of five, hoped her newly installed union jack would bolster the protective efforts of her neighbour, a local man. “He knows we’re good people, that we don’t do any harm,” she said. “I think he has explained that to the others.”Even so, as a precaution she has moved documents and other belongings to another location. “I haven’t slept in three days. I don’t know if I’ll sleep tonight.”Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

China also targeted the aerospace and defense industries by limiting 15 US entities with ties to the industry from receiving dual-use goods.“The United States is already on the back foot when it comes to manufacturing these defense technologies,” Baskaransaid in an interviewpublished by CSIS. “China is rapidly expanding its munitions production and acquiring advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States. While China is preparing with a wartime mindset, the United States continues to operate under peacetime conditions.”Trump has amassed a team of foreign policy China hawks, including a number who have warned that the US should focus more on the pacing threat posed by China over the coming decades instead of current conflicts in Ukraine or the Middle East.“Even before the latest restrictions, the US defense industrial base struggled with limited capacity and lacked the ability to scale up production to meet defense technology demands,” she continued. “Further bans on critical minerals inputs will only widen the gap, enabling China to strengthen its military capabilities more quickly than the United States.”China and the US had agreed last month in Geneva to pause the implementation of sky-high tariffs that would have delivered a severe economic blow to manufacturers and consumers in the US, as well as exporters in China.But China maintained export licenses on rare-earth metals used by both defense producers and carmakers that threatened to upend global supply chains and imperil production in the US.In particular, China has a stranglehold on the production and export of samarium, a magnet used in combination with cobalt to provide highly durable magnets used to withstand the intense temperatures in military-grade tech. China produces the entire world’s supply of the rare-earth metal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pentagon planners and other officials in the administration of Joe Biden, regularly squared off over whether foreign weapons deliveries expose a US vulnerability in case it faced off with a major military power.In order to break the deadlock, secretary of stateMarco Rubioalso abruptly announced plans to cancel hundreds of thousands of visas for Chinese students in the US. While publicly that was said as a plan to root out Chinese spies in US higher education,Axios reportedthat the visa ban was also motivated by China’s obstinance on resuming rare earths exports.The breakthrough comes as Trump is planning to displayUS militaryprowess at a parade in Washington DC this weekend that has been seen as an attempt to flex American muscle and reinforce the US president’s bonafides as a supporter of the military.Trump in 2019 ordered the Pentagon to find new sources of procuring rare earth minerals, in particular samarium, because the US did not have the capacity to produce them domestically. The initiative was “essential to the national defense”, he said then.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeTrump tariffsTrump administrationChinaDonald TrumpUS politicsAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

It is a road movie which is partly about the Holocaust and about America’s third-generation attempt at coming to terms with it, at confronting what their parents and grandparents found too painfully recent to revisit, or necessary to forget in order to survive. And partly it’s about family, male friendship and growing older.”Read the full review.The Girl With the NeedleFictionalised true crime nightmare based on Denmark’s 1921 baby-killer case, directed by Magnus von Horn, that leaves a shiver of pure fear.What we said: “It is about a world in which women’s lives are disposable and in which the authorities are disapproving of and disgusted by their suffering – and set at a time in which the first world war had normalised the idea of mass murder.”Read the full review.MariaAngelina Jolie’s Callas commands the screen in Pablo Larraín’s strange and mordant drama that portrays the diva’s haughty struggle as her voice begins to fail but her stardom remains undimmed.What we said: “Maria is the most persuasive and seductive of Larraín’s trilogy of great women at bay, after Jackie about Jackie Kennedy, and Spencer about Princess Diana. There is less sentimentality and self-importance to this one though, for all that it is about the biggest diva in history.​”Read the full review.PepeView image in fullscreenCoca colonialism … PepePhotograph: MubiHuge and wayward docu-fictional meditation goes inside inside the beautiful mind of Pablo Escobar’s hippo, shipped out to furnish the Colombian druglord’s estate.What we said: “The hippo, as a German tour guide tells us at the very beginning, may look fat and placid and rather cute, but it’s fast-moving, aggressive and dangerous to humans; perhaps the film itself, so mysteriously distended with huge digressions and non-narrative scenes, is as exotically fleshy and strange as a hippo. Yet it has bite.”Read the full review.VermiglioMaura Delpero’s beautifully made drama explores the complex dynamics of a sprawling family in an idyllic Italian village near the wartime border with Germany.What we said: “It is wonderfully acted with unaffected naturalism by its cast of professionals and newcomers and plays an extravagant, almost shameless pizzicato on the audience’s heartstrings.”Read the full review.A Complete UnknownJames Mangold’s biopic of Bob Dylan follows the rise of the era-defining star with Timothée Chalamet brilliantly embodying his shapeshifting allure.What we said: “Chalamet is a hypnotic Dylan, performing the tracks himself and fabricating to a really impressive degree that stoner-hungover birdsong. He does a very passable version of Don’t Think Twice, with the distinctive, eccentric intonations, singing as if he’s not entirely sure of the tune and appearing to run out of breath at the end of every line.”Read the full review.The BrutalistView image in fullscreenGrand designs … Adrien Brody in The Brutalist.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyEpic postwar architectural drama with Adrien Brody as a Hungarian Holocaust survivor who comes to the US and begins a distinguished career under the patronage of a wealthy man.What we said: “This is a film with thrilling directness and storytelling force, a movie that fills its widescreen and three-and-a-half-hour running time with absolute certainty and ease, as well as glorious amplitude, clarity and even simplicity – and yet also with something darkly mysterious and uncanny to be divined in its handsome shape.”Read the full review.Blue Road: The Edna O’Brien StoryOne of Ireland’s most important novelists and a woman of fierce intelligence and bravery is celebrated in Sinéad O’Shea’s thoroughly enjoyable documentary.What we said: “This portrait of the author Edna O’Brien is a reminder that most writers – most people, in fact – don’t have lives anywhere near as exciting or fulfilling as hers.”Read the full review.Hard TruthsMarianne Jean-Baptiste is exceptional as a woman in the terrifying endgame of depression in this deeply sober and compassionate drama, a Mike Leigh classic of day-to-day disillusionment and courage.What we said: “It reunites Leigh with that overwhelmingly powerful female lead, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, whose name was made by her electrifying performance in Leigh’s 1996 film Secrets and Lies, and might well get made all over again with her formidable appearance here, demonstrating the terrible connection between depression and anger.”Read the full review.The Seed of the Sacred FigExiled director Mohammad Rasoulof’s arresting tale of Iran’s violence and paranoia, and officialdom’s misogyny and theocracy, whose importance is beyond doubt.What we said: “The Seed of the Sacred Fig begins as a downbeat political and domestic drama in the familiar style of Iranian cinema, and then progressively escalates to something extravagantly crazy and traumatised – like a pueblo shootout by Sergio Leone.”Read the full review.View image in fullscreenTense … September 5.Photograph: Jürgen OlczykSeptember 5Taut media procedural revisits Munich Olympics in Tim Fehlbaum’s tense thriller focusing on the 1972 terrorist massacre through a TV crew lens.What we said: “It’s a really smart, involving, unassumingly written picture with something of James L Brooks’ Broadcast News and I couldn’t help think that maybe this is the film that Steven Spielberg could have made rather than Munich, his rather ponderous, Forsythian thriller about the aftermath.”Read the full review.To a Land UnknownMahdi Fleifel’s tale of displacement and desperation as Palestinian refugees seek a better life makes for suspenseful, melancholic viewing.What we said: “Mahmood Bakri’s excellent performance shows Chatila to be smart, personable, manipulative and ruthless, always on the lookout for ways to get money for a fake passport.”Read the full review.Memoir of a SnailSarah Snook and Kodi Smit-McPhee lend their voice talents to Adam Elliott’s ambitious animation, a charming, poignant tale of troubled twins that has a strong personal touch.What we said: “There’s an ingenuousness and innocence to Memoir of a Snail, a family-entertainment approachability that belies a strange intensity. There are some candid hints, through the obviously personal narrative touches, that in this film some very real adult pain and anger is being hidden in plain sight.”Read the full review.I Am Martin ParrEnjoyable and valuable study of tragicomic Britain’s inspired photographer, whose highly coloured 70s and 80s images revealed the white working class as never before.What we said: “The film shows that part of his skill is just looking like an ordinary bloke, going around in the crowd with his wheeled walking frame (after recent illness), smiling benignly, endlessly taking pictures.”Read the full review.View image in fullscreenTerrific fun … Superboys of Malegaon.Photograph: Amazon MGM StudiosSuperboys of MalegaonInspired by a true story, this feelgood Indian film is about some Bollywood superfans making their own movies with a cheeky but admirable DIY ethos.What we said: “There is terrific fun, charm and storytelling energy in Superboys of Malegaon, and it settles on an interesting theme: very rarely indeed does a new film-maker find success with a completely original work.”Read the full review.Ernest Cole: Lost & FoundTragic story of a fiercely pioneering photographer, a black South African whose work illuminated the reality of life under apartheid, but who lived a life of exile and homesickness.What we said: “Raoul Peck’s film, in which LaKeith Stanfield narrates a kind of heightened, fictionalised first-person account from Cole’s own writings and diaries, is devastatingly sad. It is the sadness of an artist who becomes estranged, not merely from his homeland, but from his art and his livelihood.”Read the full review.On FallingView image in fullscreenQuietly excellent… Joana Santos in On Falling.Photograph: Sixteen FilmsLaura Carreira’s impressive debut drama sees a quietly excellent Joana Santos endure dehumanising work conditions an online warehouse worker while looking for a way out.What we said: “On Falling shows us a world of sadness and exhaustion, a kind of heavy cloud cover of depression that is both a symptom of the job and a way of getting through it: only by reducing yourself to zombie-like inattention to your own needs can you get through the day as a ‘picker’.”Read the full review.Sister MidnightMumbai-set comic horror with Radhika Apte terrific as a woman preparing to settle down with a shiftless husband she barely knows when her world goes awry.What we said: “With its deadpan drollery and rectilinear tableau scenes, Sister Midnight takes something from Wes Anderson and Jim Jarmusch and also – at its most alarming – something more from Polanski’s Repulsion.”Read the full review.The Rule of Jenny PenGeoffrey Rush’s retired judge is terrorised by John Lithgow’s therapy puppet-wielding fellow resident in this claustrophobic care-home thriller of elder-on-elder abuse.What we said: “Film-maker James Ashcroft has created a scary and intimately upsetting psychological horror based on a story by New Zealand author Owen Marshall, a film whose coolly maintained claustrophobic mood and bravura performances make up for the slight narrative blurring towards the end.”Read the full review.SantoshTerrifically tense cop movie digs into sexism and caste prejudice in India, Sunita Rajwar and Shahana Goswami as a cynical veteran and a wide-eyed rookie who has inherited her late husband’s job.What we said: “Writer-director Sandhya Suri has made a tense, violent and politically savvy crime procedural set in India: a film about sexism, caste bigotry and Islamophobia that doubles as a study in the complex relationship between two female cops.”Read the full review.View image in fullscreenThe last super-rich couple in the world … Tilda Swinton and Michael Shannon in The End.Photograph: Felix Dickinson/NeonThe EndTilda Swinton and Michael Shannon go to ground in a survival bunker with their son, in Joshua Oppenheimer’s end-of-the-world singalong drama.What we said: “What Oppenheimer is doing here commands attention.

It’s an intriguing and atmospheric piece of work.”Read the full review.One to One: John & YokoView image in fullscreenDifferent flavour of fab … Still from the film Bed Peace, 1970, featured in One to One: John & Yoko.Photograph: Nic Knowland © 1970 Yoko Ono LennonA collection of staggering TV clips and amazing audio of Lennon and Ono’s life in 1970s NYC, Kevin Macdonald’s immersive collage is a pop culture fever dream.What we said: “It’s a film that mixes small screen zeitgeist fragments and madeleine moments, a memory quilt of a certain time and place, juxtaposing Jerry Rubin and Allen Ginsberg with Richard Nixon and George Wallace, John and Yoko in concert with ads for Tupperware.”Read the full review.The ReturnJuliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes star in Uberto Pasolini’s raw and urgent Odyssey adaptation, as a traumatised Odysseus faces the shameful aftermath of war.What we said: “An elementally violent movie about PTSD, survivor guilt, abandonment, Freudian dysfunction and ruined masculinity.”Read the full review.Pink Floyd at Pompeii MCMLXXIIMesmerically peculiar portrait of the band performing in the burning Italian sun in this outrageously indulgent yet vivid and beguiling music documentary.What we said: “The music and the atmosphere are an irresistible fan-madeleine for those who can remember referring to them solemnly as ‘the Floyd’ (ahem).”Read the full review.AprilShocking violence is tempered by strange, silent sequences in Dea Kulumbegashvili’s haunting abortion drama, which has echoes of The Piano Teacher.What we said: “This is not the usual ‘abortion’ issue movie in which the reactionary anti-abortion authorities are straightforwardly criticised and the pregnant woman is awarded compassionate centre stage status.”Read the full review.Julie Keeps QuietA star player at an elite tennis school decides to stay silent when the head coach is suspended in Leonardo Van Dijl’s absorbing movie.What we said: “A tense, absorbing movie of silences and absences, of difficult terrain skirted around, of subjects avoided. It’s a reminder that in key situations, to keep quiet is a stressful, strenuous and, crucially, public activity – and a survival instinct that many young people have to learn.”Read the full review.Where Dragons LiveWarm documentary from Dutch film-maker Suzanne Raes following three siblings as they clear out their enormously grand childhood home in Oxfordshire, where among the happy memories are those of cruelty.What we said: “Maybe it takes a non-British film-maker to appreciate such intense and unfashionable Englishness; not eccentric exactly, but wayward and romantic.”Read the full review.Ocean With David AttenboroughView image in fullscreenReady for a closeup … A sheepshead wrasse in a kelp forest in California in Ocean With David Attenborough.Photograph: National Geographic/PAReleased on his 99th birthday and presented in the context of his remarkable career, Attenborough’s passionate case against the ruination of the seas is matched only by nature’s grandeur in this visually stunning film.What we said: “He shows us an amazing vista of diversity and life, an extraordinary undulating landscape, a giant second planet of whose existence humanity has long been unaware but now seems in danger of damaging or even destroying.”Read the full review.RiefenstahlNauseating yet gripping story of Nazi poster woman who entranced Hitler, directed Triumph of the Will – and spent the rest of her life alternately fearful and defiant.What we said: “This documentary shows she revised her memoirs endlessly, unsure if or how to minimise her personal contact with the Nazis, especially the sinister, besotted Joseph Goebbels; her fear of war guilt was at loggerheads with her unrepentant impulse to proclaim her own prestige.”Read the full review.A New Kind of WildernessBeautiful film of an off-grid family shattered by bereavement who had to come to terms with not just the loss of a parent but a whole lifestyle.What we said: “Norwegian film-maker Silje Evensmo Jacobsen tells a painful, complicated story, more complicated than even the film itself explicitly reveals.”Read the full review.View image in fullscreenOutstanding … Good OneGood OneLily Collias is outstanding as 17-year-old Sam, who goes hiking with her dad and his best buddy in India Donaldson’s intelligent and humane feature debut.What we said: “Donaldson sets a low-key tone of banter and backtalk, in which Sam has to ride in the back of her Subaru, making herself carsick by checking her phone and annoying her dad by asking if she can drive; he finds it annoying because she is actually a better driver than he is.”Read the full review.Hallow RoadShot almost entirely inside a car, Rosamund Pike and Matthew Rhys play a splintering couple trying to save their terrified teenage daughter in a cracking thriller.What we said: “A gripping, real-time suspense thriller with a twist of the macabre, a film about family guilt and the return of the repressed.”Read the full review.Mission Impossible – The Final ReckoningTom Cruise signs off with wildly entertaining adventure in this eighth and last Mission: Impossible, as agent Ethan Hunt takes on the ultimate in AI evil.What we said: “Final Reckoning is a new and ultimate challenge (actually the second half of the challenge from the previous film) which takes Cruise’s buff and resourceful IMF leader Ethan Hunt on one last maverick, deniable mission to exasperate and yet overawe his stuffed-shirt superiors at Washington and Langley. And what might that be? To save the world of course, like all the other missions.”Read the full review.MountainheadView image in fullscreenGreat bunch of bros … Cory Michael Smith, Steve Carell, Ramy Youssef and Jason Schwartzman in Mountainhead.Photograph: HBOWeapons-grade zingers come thick and fast in Jesse Armstrong’s post-Succession uber-wealth satire about four plutocrats on a weekend away in a lodge that goes awry when the planet descends into chaos.What we said: “More than any comedy or even film I’ve seen recently, this is movie driven by the line-by-line need for fierce, nasty, funny punched-up stuff in the dialogue, and narrative arcs and character development aren’t the point. But as with Succession, this does a really good job of persuading you that, yes, this is what our overlords are really like.”Read the full review.Share your favouriteYou can tell us your favourite film of the year so far using this form.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

First, we had to stop the chaos and return Britain to economic stability. Second, we had to turn the page on Tory decline with clearLabourchoices. Third, we were instructed to rebuild our country.Wednesday’s spending review turbocharged that rebuilding. It is an investment in Britain’s renewal, so working people have more money in their pocket, more pride in their community and more hope for their children’s future. It’s what people voted for. An NHS cutting waiting lists, with care closer to the community. Wealth and opportunity no longer hoarded by only a few towns and cities.That means carbon capture projects in Merseyside, Scotland and along the east coast. It means nuclear fusion in Nottinghamshire. Rail investment in Wales. New metro schemes, everywhere from the north-east to the West Midlands, Manchester, South and West Yorkshire. Labour’s message is clear. Every community is now viewed as a source of dynamism and growth. National renewal is for everyone.Don’t mistake us – it must still be built on firm foundations. The first job of this government was to stabilise the British economy. We did need to stop the chaos. We did need to repair our public finances. And we did need to turn the page with a budget of tough but fair Labour choices. Nobody wants taxes to go up. But politics is about choices. So when we asked private schools, second homeowners and non-doms to contribute more, we chose a fairer way.Take our announcement last week to extend free school meals to every child on universal credit. One hundred thousand children will be lifted out of poverty as a result – £500 back in the pockets of hard-pressed parents. And more than that, the time. The comfort that knowing the only hunger your kid will experience that day is the hunger for learning. That is the difference we were elected to make. But it’s only possible because we took tough decisions nine months ago.It’s the same for every success in my Plan for Change so far. Every breakfast club opened, every pothole filled, every extra hospital appointment, rests on those foundations. Change and stability are not in tension. They must advance together.1:56From defence to social housing: Rachel Reeves's spending review in two minutes – videoLook at our opponents. Once again, they believe in the alchemy that says taxes can come down and spending can go up. It’s fool’s gold – precisely the sort of fiscal fantasy that dragged Britain into the mire of decline in the first place. We were crystal clear at the election – we would never put working people through that again. And we would never recklessly forfeit the opportunity to renew their communities with investment.The spending review shows why, and it starts with security. Security in your family finances, security at work, security at our borders and the defence of our country – this government is investing to keep you safe. We are protecting jobs when they are on the line, as we did with British Steel. We are creating new opportunities by investing in homegrown clean energy and life sciences where Britain has a competitive edge. We are pushing forward with the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the cold war, unleashing a “defence dividend” that will fire up our industrial communities. The NHS, too, will receive record levels of investment. The best scanners, equipment and technology will be placed in the hands of our brilliant NHS staff. And we will step up to tackle the great social justice cause of our time, with a £39bn investment in affordable housing.This last one is deeply personal for me. Shamefully, after years of Tory failure to build, more than 80% of Britons now believe owning your own home is “unaffordable for most people”. This is a national emergency – home ownership should not be a distant dream. If we don’t build more homes, homelessness rises, more children are forced to grow up in temporary accommodation, and millions of ordinary families are denied the security they deserve. It would be a disaster for working-class aspiration and I am determined to change it.I know what it’s like to struggle to make ends meet. Growing up, my family’s phone was regularly cut off, because that was the easiest bill to skip when money ran out. But because we owned our house, we always had that bedrock of security we could build a future around. A base camp for aspiration.Has Rachel Reeves made the right choices? Our panel responds to the spending reviewRead moreYoung working-class people today deserve that same opportunity. It’s basic Labour fairness. Whether you are a young family trying to buy your first home, an apprentice looking for construction jobs in your community, or a nurse working harder and harder with outdated technology at your hospital, Britain should give you a fair crack of the whip.That’s what this spending review delivers. It spreads opportunity more fairly across the country. It backs the potential of working people in every community. And with wages rising strongly, it gives a further boost to an economy that is beginning to turn a corner. A nation returned to growth, defiantly open for business, determined to deliver security and renewal for its people.I know there is so much more to do. But this week we entered a new stage in the mission of national renewal. Last autumn, we fixed the foundations. Today, we showed Britain we will rebuild.Keir Starmer is the prime minister of the United KingdomDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The government body backing the project was something called Great British Energy – Nuclear.This, it turned out, was the new name for Great British Nuclear, the unit set up in 2023 by the last government to oversee delivery of the nuclear programme. But why risk confusion with Great BritishEnergy, Ed Miliband’s publicly owned company for investing, we thought, in renewables projects such as wind, solar and hydro with a side-mission to ensure that lots of the kit is manufactured in the UK?The confusion, it seems, was deliberate. The chancellor’s spending review revealed that every penny of the £2.5bn for SMRs iscoming from GB Energy’s £8.3bn budget. That is 30% of the pot to SMRs in one gulp.One could argue, as Labour folk did, that nuclear and renewables are all part of the same low-carbon clean energy mix, so they go hand in hand and were always intended to do so. It’s true that past descriptions of GB Energy’s role have sometimes mentioned nuclear, but never as the headline act. It was never spelled out, for example, that the entirety of public support for SMRs would come from GB Energy’s budget, which would be a relevant fact to mention if you were worried that the Tories had set up Great British Nuclear but not given it funding. It rather looks as if GB Energy’s budget has been nuked by the Treasury.“Labour will capitalise Great British Energy with £8.3bn over the next parliament,” said the manifesto and, strictly speaking, that pledge is still being honoured. It’s just that GB Energy will be directing almost a third of its allocation to the nuclear body that we had previously regarded as a separate unit.But it does make GB Energy a strange beast if it is now the main government vehicle for investing in SMRs, a cutting-edge technology that tends to involve permanently big numbers and follow-on rounds of funding. GB Energy’s initial adventures, note, have been low-key and local – funding for installing solar panels on schools and hospitals, for example. Worthy stuff, but a million miles away from the development of next-generation nuclear technology.GB Energy will be expanding into new and exciting areas later this year, say Labour insiders. We’ll see what that brings. The company’s core mission seems to be a work in progress.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryNils Pratley on financeSpending review 2025Nuclear powerEnergyRolls-RoycecommentShareReuse this content"

Give me a perimenopausal Norwegian woman any dayWed 11 Jun 2025 12.39 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 13.31 EDTShareThe current TV landscape leans heavily towards shows that skewer the rich from the point of view of writers who wildly, if sneakily, admire them. To be less polite: if shows such as the most recent White Lotus, the Apple TV+ show Your Friends & Neighbours and moviessuch as Mountainheadare all enraptured with themselves and the people they dramatise – targets who havebeen known to becomethe shows’ biggest fans – then for those viewers who have had enough, there is an alternative. It’s in Norwegian, and while watching it will force you uncomfortably close to using the phrase “hymn to middle age”, it does at least avoid the 360 degrees of glorified douchebags presently dominating TV.The Norwegian dramedyPernilleunfolds over five seasons, recently made available on Netflix, and is part of a small but marked trend around women in middle age that offers a buffer against universal bro culture. In my experience, people don’t generally like to be told they are having a moment, since it draws attention to the fact that they weren’t previously having a moment and likely won’t get another moment any time soon – but the fact remains that middle-aged women are having a moment.Mostly this takes the form of endless books and podcasts about menopause, a heartening suspension of an age-old taboo, even if it does occasionally involve a female content creator inviting us to accompany her on her “menopause journey” (no thank you!) or forcing us topay attentionto Drew Barrymore. In the case of Pernille – written by and starring the 50-year-old Norwegian actor Henriette Steenstrup – it involves a storyline built around a single mother and child protection officer in Oslo managing her two stroppy teenage daughters, her dad who is 75 and who has just came out as gay, and her affair with her colleague, a lovely county lawyer called Bjørnar. In outline, it sounds wholesome and conventional, but the writing is acute and, for my money, Pernille has more interesting things to say about sexuality than, for example,Miranda Julyand all her feverish strivings towards the avant garde.And, of course, it has a lot more to say about the experience of being alive than a bunch of fictional billionaires exchanging bons mots. The takeaway from Pernille is that there is nothing more fraught and complicated than regular life, and nothing structurally more sound – or better engineered for load bearing – than the middle-aged woman holding it together.In the show, Pernille’s ex-husband is a preoccupied novelist whose career always comes first, and when we meet her in the pilot she is mourning the death of her sister while trying to provide for her family and the abused children of greater Oslo. It feels rude but necessary to point this out: Steenstrup is a telegenic but regular-sized woman who probably wouldn’t have been cast as the lead in a US show. When her kids tell her to fuck off, or her ex-husband writes a book romanticising the affair he had when she was pregnant, the verisimilitude makes the drama intensely believable.I’m a woman of 48 – and as replaceable in the office as the swivel chair at my desk | Nilanjana BhowmickRead moreBut the show is also funny and lightly delivered, avoiding the trap of a lot of content about middle-aged women, which is the suggestion that perimenopause is just one long, terrible nightmare. I refer you to the actor Naomi Watts, whose book,Dare I Say It: Everything I Wish I’d Known About Menopause, is a helpful resource but also, possibly because publishing contracts come with big word counts, teases out every last drama of being a middle-aged woman as though it is a tour of duty in Afghanistan. (Watts has released a line of wellness products aimed at alleviating the worst menopausal symptoms and, of course, good luck to her.)These descriptions are a useful corrective to silence, but they tend to overlook the flipside of all the discomfort and change, which is the tremendous release of energy experienced by many middle-aged women, some of it angry, much of it related to the dawning realisation that in any given environment they are the most competent people in the room. Last year, I attended the fifth grade graduation ceremony of my children’s elementary school and came away, after hours of chair stacking and table folding, reminded of the fact that a good chunk of the US public school system runs on the volunteer labour of middle-aged women, most of whom also have jobs.The figure of Pernille, meanwhile, without being weird about it, properly represents and celebrates this fact: a fortysomething Norwegian woman sitting in her car in her garage to hide from her children, counselling her dad through the ridiculous rollercoaster of his late coming-out, managing her serious job and making poor decisions around her own dating life is inspiring and touching – and exactly the hero we need.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

No wonder the birthrate is fallingWed 11 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 06.47 EDTShareEveryone told me “the juggle” would get easier when my daughter started reception this year. It was, quite simply, a lie. As any parent of a school-aged child will tell you they’re hardly ever there.Mothers started exchanging panicked messages about the summer holiday in our class WhatsApp group in May, sharing links to clubs and childcare options they’ve already booked, which all look terrible, and possibly worse than just juggling it all at home. And I only have one child. This week,a UN reportrevealed that millions of people around the world are not having as many children as they would like, and I know why: yes, it’s “the high cost of parenthood”, and for many of us a big part of that is paying for something to do with your offspring when school is not looking after them.One option is a gymnastic “camp” – which is out of town, only a week long, and finishes by 3pm. I could thrust my five-year-old into a new hobby, but would it really be worth it for just a week? What about the otherfiveof the summer holidays? Assuming I work from home, with a 9am drop-off, I could be back at my desk by 9.45 but then I would have to leave again by 2.30, which hardly seems worth it. By the time we’d got into the swing of things, the camp would have ended and I’d need a new sport lined up to take its place the following Monday.View image in fullscreenChildren at a summer camp in the Netherlands, July 2023.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/ShutterstockA few school mums say they’ve booked in with a local private school, over the English border from where I live in Wales. There’s a PE teacher running something open to nearby schools, which also doesn’t cover the whole holiday and would cost a fortune.The money isn’t really the issue though, because even if you have money, there’s nowhere to go and even the terrible options are always booked up fast. It’s not like there’s an amazing solution and it’s just out of reach – there’s truly just nothing available. And the au pair system waskilled by Brexit, so that’s not an option any longer either.The problem is, there’s more school leave than parents are legally entitled to take from work, and we’re living in a two-income economy. If two parents added both of their 5.6 weeks of leave together, and were guaranteed the leave they asked for, it still wouldn’t cover the amount of school holiday – and that’s assuming they never took any time off together as a family. The school calendar hasn’t been updated since it was created in the Victorian era, when the way we worked and parented looked very different. To top it all, this generation of boomer grandparents don’t want to help either, because they want to “enjoy retirement” and go on holidays instead.The standard of parenting expected of us is like nothing history has ever seen. Even when families did have two working parents, like in my family, no one took time off work to look after the kids. They just didn’t look after them. My grandparents would both work and leave my dad to find his own fun until dinner time, but today we would (rightly) call that child neglect. Once he was hit by a car, because he was too young to know you have to look both ways when crossing the road. He was on his way to the beach, with another child, to sail a raft he’d built.In the sea.And in my experience,it’s a gendered issue. I haven’t seen any dads in the chat talking about solutions, because for most of them, it’s not a problem. They get to go off and do their work, and attend their conferences, without worrying about it. They don’t get frantic calls from their wives asking them to troubleshoot childcare problems if they dare try to leave the house.Children to have free bus travel in west of England during summer holidaysRead moreEven part-time jobs arenot properly designed for parents. Part-timers who work three days a week will only be entitled to 16.8 days of leave and the school holidays take up to 13 weeks. And that’s before we get into the inset days and sick days, and who covers them? (It’s mothers; it’s me.)It doesn’t have to be this way. In other countries, like the US, they shove their children off to overnight camps for nine to 12 weeks at a time. It’s not a perfect solution, but at least people can stay employed. The French, as always, seem to have it right by just taking off for the summer with their gorgeous annual leave.The most workable solution I’ve seen isAmazon’s “term-time” contract, which allows parents to take 10 weeks of leave a year while keeping a full-time job, with a combination of paid and unpaid holiday leave. They’ve been running the scheme since 2023, and the companyhasn’t crashed and burnedyet. If only more companies could see the benefits – which include a diverse workforce filled with mothers with a host of skills companies are missing out on.Childcare is infrastructure. Just like we need roads, a public health system and transport, the country needs a childcare solution. Today’s children will pay for your pensions, provide your healthcare and build your roads. But only if we make it possible for people to keep having them.Rhiannon Picton-James is a freelance journalist and opinion writer.

Anyone identifying as heterosexual must immediately present to the Office of Homosexual Affairs (OHA) to receive a list of instructions on how to comport themselves during this most hallowed of holidays.OK, fine, I may be misrepresenting things somewhat.

Strangers on the street: please stop asking me if my wife is my twin sister!People think I look like my girlfriend – but it’s natural to desire your doppelganger | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThis has been a longstanding problem. Indeed, Iwrote about it in 2018when my now wife was my pre-wife. While we do look vaguely similar we are not related. As I wrote then: “She is an Ashkenazi Jew from Boston; I am a Palestinian from Brixton. I am not sure if our relationship is kosher or halal, but it is 100% incest-free.” Is it lazy and embarrassing to quote oneself? Yes. But because it is Pride month I am going to do it proudly anyway. It’s been a bad year; us gays are tired.Anyway, since I wrote that, time has marched relentlessly on. We got married, had a baby and approximately 9,742 arguments about the optimal way to stack the dishwasher. I figured that once people saw us strolling togetheren famille, a switch would click and strangers might stop demanding to know if we shared DNA. But no, the situation has only got worse; every few weeks some random person fields the question. The other day my wife came home from dropping the kid off at school and reported that the crossing guard (“lollipop lady” in Britain), had yelled down the street after her: “HEY! ARE YOU AND THE OTHER ONE TWINS?”Honestly, I’m starting to get a complex. Are my wife and I starting to look more and more alike as we age? Are we morphing into the same person? Or, and this is my preferred theory, is the uptick in questions due to the fact that we moved from New York (where most people politely ignore you) to Philadelphia (where, and I say this lovingly, nobody seems to have a filter)?I know I recently wrote a piece about the importance of free speech but, this Pride month, some heterosexuals should learn to self-censor.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Why are we still waiting?Jon WorthRomance, excitement and sustainability – continent-crossing sleeper trains should be a hit. It’s time for the EU to catch onWed 11 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 12.21 EDTShareAs Europeans woke up to the joy of travel post-lockdown, it looked as though we were in store for aresurgenceof continent-crossing night trains. Sleeper train fans hailed a “night train renaissance” and a “rail revolution”, combining some of the nostalgia for an old way of travelling with modern climate and sustainable transport concerns.The long-distance European train journey might be slower than a short-haul flight, but it is surely better in terms of the environment and the traveller experience. For those on a budget, the prospect of saving on a night in a hotel appeals too.But as anyone who has tried to plan a holiday train trip for this summer is likely to have found, night trains are still few and far between, especially in western Europe. And if there is a night train at all on a route, it will often be booked up months in advance. That’s not all: reliability and onboard service are often not up to scratch, with carriages on many routes pushing 50 years old.The traditional behemoths of European rail – France’s SNCF, Germany’s Deutsche Bahn and Spain’s Renfe – have little or no interest in the night-train market, preferring more profitable high-speed daytime trains instead. Only Austria’s ÖBB has bucked the trend, ordering a fleet of33 new trainsfor its Nightjet service. For comparison, Deutsche Bahn ownsalmost 300high-speed daytime trains. Night services remain a drop in the ocean.Now Nox, a Berlin-based private startup, hasannounced plansit claims will change all that and blow open the night-train market with a radical rethink of the passenger experience. No more old or secondhand carriages; Nox says it intends to build a new fleet. No more asking travellers to share with snoring strangers in couchettes either: the fleet will have only one- and two-person compartments, albeit rather small ones. Pilot services are due to start in 2027 and regular operations by the end of the decade.This approach on the key question is right – the only way to offer more night-train routes is to build new trains. But Nox will not be the first newcomer to try to crack this market. Midnight Trains, a Paris-based startup, promisedhotels on wheelsin 2021, but investors were not convinced and theventure folded. Dutch operation GoVolta hasbeen unableto turn a successful air-package travel business into the equivalent on rail.European Sleeper, which also launched in 2021, has done a little better – its motley collection of elderly carriages runs three times a week from Brussels via Amsterdam and Berlin to Prague, but without new carriages the company will remain tiny.View image in fullscreenThe view from the European Sleeper, which goes from Brussels to Prague.Photograph: PRWhile Nox, like its predecessors, faces an uphill struggle, in a few ways it is different. Its plan to rethink the layout of a night-train carriage, making it more appealing to modern travellers – and safer for women – makes sense. Standardisation - all the carriages will be the same - keeps operations simple. One of the founders previously worked for FlixBus’s rail arm, FlixTrain, in Germany, so there is genuine railway experience. Either way, UK passengers should not hold their breath – night trains through the Channel Tunnel are not on the cards, being operationally too difficult to even contemplate.Efforts by any private operator to solve the night-train puzzle are welcome, but the problem ultimately is political. And as most European countries are too small for national night trains, that means solving these issues EU wide. The European Commission, in a2021 report, flagged a dozen routes where night trains would make economic sense but currently do not run. Yet, in the years since then, no action has been taken.It turns out you’re never too old to go Interrailing around Europe | Phil MongredienRead moreBrussels is steadily working to harmonise diverging national rules that make running international trains such a hassle. But night trains – locomotive hauled, medium speed and running at night when track capacity is easier to obtain – arguably face fewer hurdles than other train types.It is time for the EU to provide financial guarantees for acquisitions of new night-train carriages, and make those guarantees available to both privately owned and state-owned companies. With at least half a dozen train manufacturers in the EU it could be a boon to European industry as well. And the requirement from the commission in return would be Europe-wide compatibility – that guarantees would only be for go-anywhere carriages that can be deployed anywhere from Barcelona to Bodø, Stockholm to Sofia.So, this summer, as you stand in interminable queues at an airport, or stare at the bumper of the car ahead of you in a traffic jam, remember that all of this could be better. A night-train renaissance could get you to your holiday destination more comfortably and more sustainably.The EU’s actions on international rail lag behind its rhetoric. Building more night-train carriages to run more services on tracks already there should be a no brainer.Jon Worth is an independent campaigner and writer about European railwaysExplore more on these topicsRail travelOpinionEuropeTransport policyEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

This retreat from global health threatens to unravel hard-won advances against diseases we have nearly conquered.Polio, which paralysed hundreds of thousands of children annually just 40 years ago, has been eliminated in most parts of the world. Meanwhile, there has been a resurgence of diseases such as measles and cholera in populations besieged by conflict and climate emergencies.Britain faces a critical choice: follow this global trend of disengagement or stand firm as a bulwark for international health security.I understand the tough trade-offs the government must make to get public spending under control, but the stakes extend beyond humanitarian concerns to our own national interests. Last year, thedetection of poliovirus in UK sewersthreatened our own children and delivered a reminder that diseases respect no borders. Our protection at home depends directly on our commitment to efforts abroad.Yet the government’s budget spending review promises precisely the wrong direction. Byslashing international aid to a 25-year low– from 0.5% of gross national income to just 0.3% – to finance increased defence spending, the government paradoxically risks undermining our own domestic health security.A strong global health budget surely reflects our deepest values. No child should die from a disease we can preventIn real terms, this would gut our development assistance by 40% in just four years. Such draconian cuts would severely undermine all major global health initiatives.Of course, fiscal prudence is necessary, but how can we ignore the humanitarian and strategic costs of these reductions?Even beyond self-protection, a strong global health budget surely reflects our deepest values. No child should die from a disease we can prevent.Threats to global health inevitably become threats to Britain’s health, and all our protection depends on maintaining our international leadership in this field.Now, as vulnerable children face renewed threats from these very diseases, polio stands as a glaring example of what is at stake.In 1988, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was formed – a landmark public-private partnership led by national governments alongside partners including Rotary International, the World Health Organization and Unicef. This collaborative effort is crucial for tackling a major health threat such as polio. Since worldwide vaccination efforts began, an estimated20 million children who would have been paralysedare walking today, and approximately 1.6 million deaths have been averted.This is remarkable, but fragile, progress. In 2024, the number of children paralysedrose in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the two remaining endemic countries. In grim examples of how conflict can upend everything, polioparalysed a child in Gazafor the first time in two decades last year and continues to afflict families in Sudan. Not investing in polio could translate to200,000 new casesof the disease every year, including in countries where it has long been eradicated, and cost the world billions.Pound for pound, prevention has consistently proved to be a “best buy” compared with endlessly responding to outbreaks. The financial case for continued investment in polio eradication is unassailable.Yet the global eradication agenda faces a criticalfunding gap of about £1.7bnto meet its overall £5bn target. The UK has invested£1.3bn since 1988and is one of the effort’s staunchest backers. Support is needed now more than ever. At its core, the GPEI is a partnership.To abandon our commitments now, on the threshold of ending polio for good, would undermine decades of investment, leave millions of children unprotected and ultimately cost more in the long run.We have the tools to end polio for good, along with strong public backing: last month, more than 85,000 people across the UK participated in the Rise Togethermovement challengein support of efforts to end the disease.As Britain faces its most challenging fiscal scrutiny in decades, the decisions made today will define our country’s economic success – as well as our reputation as stewards of a safer, healthier world for all. The budget spending review presents an opportunity to state unequivocally that the UK will maintain a long-term commitment to protecting children worldwide, including our own, from preventable diseases.The choice before us is clear. We can honour a proud tradition of global health leadership by maintaining our commitment to eradicate polio once and for all, or we can retreat at the very moment victory is within reach.Sarah Champion is theLabourMP for RotherhamExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentGlobal healthPolioAidHealthCholeraTax and spendingcommentShareReuse this content"

Its headlines echo the twin themes of the referendum campaign: control immigration, fund the NHS. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said she would end the use of hotels forasylum seekers“in this parliament” saving £1bn a year, while NHS spending will rise by3% a year. Ms Reeves framed it as a politics of security and compassion. Yet it reads as Brexit’s populist promises, filtered through Westminster orthodoxy.The risk is that this is all slogan and very little solution. The asylum savings are speculative, and the annual increase in NHS budgets is below itshistorical average. There are also real-termscutsor essentially flat budgets for key departments such as transport,educationand local government. The Home Office faces cuts deeper than asylum savings alone, prompting alarm from police and the London mayor,Sadiq Khan.Plainly, what looks good today for the chancellor may feel insufficient tomorrow on hospital wards, high streets or in the classroom. The everyday experience of voters will shape their judgment. That is why there were nods from Ms Reeves to cost-of-living pressures by keeping the cap onbus faresand the insistence that police and council funding would see “spending power” rises. Despite negative briefing, Ed Miliband secured significant wins in the review, notably protecting the £13bn Warm Homes insulation scheme and cementing his influence over the GB Energy agenda, while bolstering the UK’s net‑zero energy strategy.Ms Reeves shrewdly tightened belts and loosened seams. Britain, under Labour, will be a place where “every pound is spent wisely” while billions in capital investment would level up the country. This is down to a welcome change in the fiscal rules brought in by the chancellorlast Octoberthat allows more room for such investment. That shift enables the fanfare of the review: the nuclear reactors, the affordable housing andthe new Manchester-to-Liverpool railway.What has not changed is the government’s rule that says its current budget must be in surplus by the end of the forecast. This restricts the state’s day-to-day spending and – despite being relaxednext year– leads to real-terms cuts in departments as well as curbing options to directly boost household income. The spending review is a bet that infrastructure spending will lead to higher productivity. But it lacks the demand-side fuel to make these projects generate inclusivegrowthwithin this parliament. That makes it harder to hit the government’s economic mission milestone of higher disposable household income and GDP per capita.Ms Reeves will probably have to raisetaxesto meet her fiscal rules, not least because the government’s promises keep stacking up and money needs to be found to restore winter fuel payments and reconsider the two-child benefit cap. Yet neither the prime minister nor the chancellor dares to say it aloud. Higher taxes, especially on wealth, would be a good thing. These may become inevitable as Ms Reeves’ calculations rest upon£14bn of projected efficiency gains– as if cuts can be pain-free.Political storytelling only goes so far when the effects of policy show up in threadbare services andflatlining household incomes. For all the investment, the worry must be voters see more drift than renewal. Without a shift in fiscal doctrine, Labour risks governing in prose while the public still waits for the poetry it was promised.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He has gratefully accepted the early gift of the demonstrations, which have spread across the country, with more scheduled for Saturday. The president’simmigration crackdownspurredoverwhelmingly peaceful protestsin Los Angeles. Ordering in troops, over the governor’s head, then inflamed the situation and allowed the agent of chaos to portray himself as its nemesis once more.Mr Trump has diverted attention from his rift with Elon Musk, the stalling of his “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill, the court-ordered return of the wrongly deported Kilmar Ábrego García and the impending impact of tariffs. But underlying the manufactured crisis is a deeper agenda: reigniting fear of undocumented migrants, delegitimising protest, and thus expanding his power. Migrant families, and those who have taken to the streets to support them, areportrayed as “animals”and the perpetrators of “invasion and third-world lawlessness” – requiring Mr Trump to amass more might to protect America.Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, rightly described this asan assault on democracy. As he noted, “authoritarian regimes begin by targeting people who are least able to defend themselves. But they do not stop there.” Due process has been discarded. American citizens are among those being swept up in raids. Mr Trump has said that Mr Newsom himself should be arrested. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, calls the protesters “insurrectionists” – though his boss, of course,pardoned the actual insurrectionistsof the January 6 Capitol attack.Mr Trump’s tactics arefamiliarin both the broad and narrow sense. In his book On Tyranny, published in 2017, the historian Timothy Snyderurged readersto listen for “dangerous words” such as “emergency” and reminded them that “the sudden disaster” requiring the suspension of freedoms “is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book”.Mr Trump drew a bleak portrait of American carnage in his inaugural speech and described himself as“the only thing standing between the American dream and total anarchy”. Since his re-election he has declared emergencies to push through tariffs, loosen energy regulations and ramp up deportations. His methods are transparent – and sometimes blocked by courts – yet still effective. For his supporters, each rock thrown, each billow of smoke, is fresh evidence of the menacing “other” encroaching upon their home.Yet if his methods are familiar, they are also going further. He has moved fromxenophobiato echoing fascist tropes of migrants “poisoning the blood” and portrays an enemy within,suggesting that Mr Newsom and Karen Bass, the Los Angeles mayor, aretrying to aid “criminal invaders”. In his first term, Mr Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act (and, reportedly, said that troops should “just shoot” Black Lives Matter protesters). Gen Mark Milley and others are no longer present to hold him back. Alarmingly, he warns that any protests at his parade will face “very heavy force”.All those who stand against Mr Trump’s weaponised bigotry and hunger for untrammelled power must make it clear that they are defending the law and not defying it. Responsibly challenging the abuse and entrenchment of power is not only the right of citizens, but a duty.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

You can only imagine how proud his family must be of it all. Especially his father, Amit Shah, who is Narendra Modi’s right-hand man, and India’s minister for home affairs. They say that when Shah started at the ICC he made a point of pushing through a few ruthless staffing decisions just to prove to everybody that he is his own man.The upshot, anyway, is that right now cricket is beginning to feel worryingly like it is an international sport being run on one man’s whims. And this week, the game is making every effort to arrange itself around him. The MCC certainly wants him to be as comfortable as possible, especially after he didn’t bother to turn up to its World Cricket Connects conference for “the most influential voices in the sport” last weekend. It even invited Shah to ring the bell to mark the start of play before the final. I swear there were even a couple of MCC members giving him applause for doing such a good job of tugging on the rope.“A privilege,” Shah wrote on X later that same afternoon, from his seat in the president’s box, where the ECB’s own executives, chair Richard Thompson and chief executive Richard Gould, seemed to be busy failing to get his attention. The firstWorld Test Championshipfinal had a worldwide audience of 180 million, this one is beginning to feel like it’s trying to win over an audience of one, because the only way it can really be sure of itself is if Shah believes it’s worth persisting with.View image in fullscreenJay Shah at Lord’s.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesAnytime two Test cricket fans get together, there’s sure to be a conversation about the state of the game. There were 25,000 odd here on the first day, and the background chat was about whether or not the Test schedule should be changed so that India, Australia, and England can play each other more often; whether the 12 teams might soon be split into two divisions; if it even makes sense for the smaller nations to play it given that it costs so much money to arrange games against and between them; or whether, as everybody knows it ought to, the game needs to change the way revenues are being distributed so those same smaller teams can afford to play.Test cricket has been going for almost 150 years now, and yet somehow it still feels like it needs to prove it has a future. This is the first time that the showpiece final hasn’t involved India, and the knock-on effect is that the viewing figures are unlikely to make much of an argument for the format.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The quality of the batting, bowling, and catching was a cut above any of the cricket held in England so far this summer. There were spells, through the morning, and just after lunch, when the contest betweenSouth Africa’s opening bowlers Kagiso Rabadaand Marco Jansen, and Australia’s vaunted top-order batsmen, Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, and Travis Head, felt like stop-what-you’re doing cricket. If you looked around the ground then, no one was nodding off, or nattering away, or looking at their phone. Almost everyone’s attention was on what was happening in the middle.A little later in the day, once the sun was out, Shah was spotted taking selfies with fans around the back of the grandstands. He seemed to be enjoying himself. And everyone who loves Test cricket ought to be happy to hear it.Explore more on these topicsWorld Test ChampionshipInternational Cricket CouncilAustralia cricket teamSouth Africa cricket teamCricketAustralia sportSport politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

All that could be heard was the deep blare of a horn from a large vehicle, which went on for an uncomfortably long time. Then the realisation dawned. It was the Senegal team bus and the driver was geeing up the gaggle of fans draped in the country’s colours, still ecstatic at howthey had beaten England 3-1.The celebrations had got into full swing when Cheikh Sabaly, on as a substitute,swept home the clinching goalin stoppage time, the Senegal bench emptying, everybody wanting in on it. No team from Africa had beaten England before and it did not matter it was a friendly. The scene in the visiting dressing room was probably best described – as heard – by Thomas Tuchel.Eberechi Eze offers England’s brightest spark amid end-of-season gloom | Jonathan LiewRead more“The players came in … it was next to my changing room … screaming: ‘Senegal!’ The next one: ‘Senegal!’” theEnglandhead coach said. “Hitting on boxes and whatever. It was not offensive. It was nice to see what it means to them.”Tuchel wondered how his players would have reacted if they had won 3-1. “Would player after player go in the dressing room, would the coach go in the dressing room, screaming: ‘England’? Would the players jump up and down? Or would we all say: ‘Hey guys, it’s a friendly match, this is what we expect’?”Tuchel’s question was essentially rhetorical. England would not have been overjoyed. “We would have said: ‘Calm down, it’s just a friendly, it was good but OK … a good development, put it into context,’” he said. “It shows me what it means to them, an excitement and joy to celebrate this victory. We are not there at the moment.“We expect a lot from us. I get it because we expect also a lot from us and myself. I’m missing a little bit the excitement and laughter and the joy. I see it in training. I saw a glimpse of it after the 2-1 [for Senegal in the 62nd minute]. I liked the reaction [to that goal]. But in general: no.”View image in fullscreenÉdouard Mendy (left) and Nicolas Jackson lead Senegal’s post-match celebrations.Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Getty ImagesFor Tuchel, something is missing and he seems a little baffled. When he breezed into the job, it was with talk of a quick and aggressive approach, of Premier League passions, of a band of brothers high-fiving their way to World Cup glory. The famous Tommy Tuchel main character energy would light a fire in everyone. It has not happened, the overall sense being a heaviness of body and soul, safe passes into feet, not enough dynamic running or risk-taking.It is a worry.Tuchel is not the first England coach to see a gap between how the players express themselves at club level and for the national team; how happiness and freedom can be overtaken by fear of what might go wrong, a desire just to muddle through. Against Senegal, there were other causes for alarm, starting with a back four that has a transitional feel with John Stones injured and Tuchel looking beyond Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw.It was easy to fret about the fourth member of the defensive line that has served England so well for so long. Kyle Walker was awfully slow to react to Ismaïla Sarr’s run for the Senegal equaliser and it chimed with a jittery performance undermined by an apparent lack of certainty in the attribute that has always sustained him: pace. Has it finally deserted him?Tuchel made the point that Walker lacked rhythm after a disrupted end to the season with Milan, mainly because of a broken arm. It was his first start since 5 April. Tuchel also said it was vital that Walker, and every other England player, was able to resolve his club situation.Walker is back at Manchester City, but he will not go with themto the Club World Cup. The 35-year-old has been written off before, not least when he went more than a year without a cap under Gareth Southgate from the summer of 2019. He must find the answers again if he is to reach 100 caps. He is on 96.There were errors across the defence against Senegal; the first two concessions, in particular, so cheap after routine balls over the top. Trevoh Chalobah was exposed on the first, Myles Lewis-Skelly on the second. Then there was the structure as England tried to build out from the goalkeeper, Dean Henderson.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Passes went astray under pressure. Tuchel needs time to finesse the patterns and it will be vital to master a controlled, possession-based approach for the expected high temperatures at the World Cup next summer. He does not have time.View image in fullscreenIt was a sobering evening for Thomas Tuchel, who was left feeling England have ‘a lot to learn’.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersThe good bit against Senegal, after the stodge ofthe 1-0 qualifying win over Andorrain Barcelona on Saturday, came in response to Habib Diarra’s goal for 2-1. With Morgan Gibbs-White and Morgan Rogers on and Eberechi Eze coming alive, there was speed and intensity, promising combinations. Tuchel would also introduce Jude Bellingham and Noni Madueke in the 71st minute. An equaliser looked on, although it did not come, Bellingham having a goal disallowed towards the end.There were questions within this, including where it left Harry Kane, who made way for Rogers. The captain scored England’s early goal and caught the eye, dropping deep to make turns and play searching passes. However, the team danced to his tune and played at a slower pace. Perhaps, as Tuchel has suggested, England will need more than one way of working.As Tuchel assesses the camp, he will know there were mitigating factors for the performances. The tired legs after a gruelling club season. The awkward break between its climax and the international matches, the need for many players to effectively clock back on. The lack of jeopardy against Andorra and Senegal.Tuchel is fond of telling reporters what the headline in their newspapers should be. So, what was it after Senegal? “Your headline is maybe a bit harder than I would make a headline,” he said, with a smile. “Headline: yeah … a lot to learn.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelSenegal football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The protest relates to a system requiring fans to attend at least 10 league matches if they are to retain their ticket for the following season.A group of fans known as the Trade Union Blues, made up of union members, have engaged the law firm Leigh Day to ask the club to review the policy, arguing that the requirement “potentially gives rise to claims under the Equality Act of 2010”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Illness, pregnancy, disability, caring responsibilities or working shifts [could] now cost you your season ticket. Many of our members have followed City through thick and thin and now face exclusion because of inflexible criteria that takes no account of individual circumstances.”The policy was announced by City last month,after season-ticket prices were frozenfollowing consultation with the club’s elected fan advisory board, City Matters. It increased the obligatory number of home league matches a season-ticket holder must attend from 14 to 16, but also mandated that only six of those games could be shared with friends or handed back to the club for resale.City believe that ticket use is a growing problem for the club, having told City Matters in February that an average 8% of 37,000 season-ticket members do not attend a given Premier League game. Liverpool and Arsenal have mandatory attendance requirements for season-ticket holders but neither cap the number of games that can be shared or resold. Arsenal exempt season-ticket holders with disabilities from the cap.Ryan Bradshaw, human rights partner at Leigh Day, said: “The updated policy introduced by Manchester City applies a blanket requirement for personal attendance which significantly disadvantages a number of protected groups under the Equality Act. There is no indication that any meaningful mitigation procedures are in place. It disadvantages those working-class fans who are required to work shift patterns or precariously and may be unable to attend games for fear of losing their jobs.” City did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityDisabilityFootball ticket pricesnewsShareReuse this content"

The SER will be calculated using their average ranking during a 12-week period before and during their absence and can be used up to WTA 500 events.Raducanu and Boulter laugh off Queen’s doubles defeat with singles to comeRead moreA growing number of players are opting to take time away from the sport in order to give birth or actively plan their families during their careers. At the urging of the players, over the past few years the WTA has taken significant steps towards addressing these issues, helping to provide players with options to plan their families while competing at the highest level.Earlier this year, the organisation announced that it would offer players paid maternity leave. Those who take time away from the tour to give birth are also able to use their previous ranking to enter 12 tournaments over three years from the birth of their child.Sloane Stephens, the 2017 US Open champion, has twice used the short tennis off-season to freeze her eggs. “During my first retrieval cycle, I ended up gaining around 20lb due to hormones and taking a break from training that, going forward, I would be more aware of and plan differently for my next cycle this off-season,” the Americantold Essence last year.“It is also important to rest and not over-exert yourself, at the risk of developing ovarian torsion or other complications, so I had to really plan out my training blocks and off-season to make it all happen. Because of this, I am really passionate about introducing protected rankings for players undergoing fertility treatments so that they can feel supported in making decisions for themselves and properly caring for their bodies without rushing back out of fear of ranking points or career setbacks. “In a statement on Wednesday, Stephens hailed the WTA’s new ruling: “I’m incredibly proud of our sport in recognising the importance of fertility treatments for female athletes. For any woman, the conversation of family life versus a career is nuanced and complex. The WTA has now created a safe space for players to explore options and to make the best decisions for themselves. It’s truly groundbreaking and will empower this generation, and future generations of players, to continue with the sport they love without having to compromise.”Explore more on these topicsTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

OMG-mont. Over the top-mont. The prevailing sense among anybody who ponders aUS Openat this site in rural Pennsylvania is how wonderfully demanding the challenge always is. Cue entertainment. As Xander Schauffele appropriately put it: “I don’t think people turn the TV on to watch some of the guys just hit a 200-yard shot on the green. They turn on the US Open to see a guy shooting eight over and suffer. That’s part of the enjoyment of the US Open for viewers.”Strap in and enjoy the show. This version of Oakmont has rough that is routinely more than five inches thick. Menacing, sloped greens add to the idea of inevitable carnage. The 125th staging of the major will be a war of attrition, one which will physically and mentally exhaust the finest golfers in the world. Temper tantrums are guaranteed.‘It felt impossible’: McIlroy struggles in practice at Oakmont before US OpenRead moreThe job of the United StatesGolfAssociation is to ensure the environment is at least fair. Dissenting voices exist already on that front. Take Michael Kim, the world No 54. “The greens here feel a bit Mickey Mouse,” Kim said. “The weird sections and overall slopes are just way more than we’re used to.”This will be met with shrugs at the USGA. This is a major with a 288-yard par three, after all. The organisers seem to revel in the kind of chaos Schauffele referenced. Mike Whan, the USGA’s chief executive, offered sharp historical perspective. “1,385 players have played a major championship on this venue,” he said. “And 27 of them finished their four days under par, 2%. So that’s quite a test out there.”Oakmont laps up its reputation as the sternest of tests. A T-shirt sold in the club shop bears a quote from the son of the course’s founder: “Let the clumsy, the spineless, the alibi artist stand aside.” Phil Mickelson, a short-game maestro, was pictured struggling to move the ball from greenside rough during his practice on Wednesday.Scottie Scheffler played in the 2016 US Open here as an amateur. If there is a gap in the world No 1’s illustrious CV, it relates to his ability to handle the major sites thatare not Augusta Nationalor the player-friendly US PGA Championship. Scheffler’s next step is to demonstrate he can emerge successfully from the grind, edging closer to a career grand slam. In his favour at Oakmont is his unshakable temperament and incredible accuracy with irons in hand.It seems incredibleto write off Rory McIlroy’s chanceswithin weeks of his epic Masters success. However, the Northern Irishman is clearly grasping for rhythm after achieving all he ever wanted to achieve. McIlroy’s close friend Shane Lowry looks to have a strong chance here. So, too, does his Ryder Cup teammate Justin Rose. Collin Morikawa, Corey Conners and Russell Henley are all worthy of attention. Schauffele, who has been disrupted by injury since winning two majors in 2024, once again has live hope as he edges back to form.View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler’s level-headed temperament should aid his chances of handling Oakmont.Photograph: Andrew Redington/Getty Images“Tough but fair,” said John Bodenhamer, the USGA’s director of championships. “A lot of discussion about Oakmont being tough. It certainly is, but our mantra is tough but fair. What does that mean? It’s pretty simple. It’s not about the score, it’s about getting every club in a player’s bag dirty, all 15 of them. The 14 in their bag and the one between their ears. And we work hard on that, and that’s how we’ve gone about our business here at Oakmont. It’s the culture of this club. They want it to be tough.“When you think about the cream rising to the top, think about this: of the nine men to win the US Open at Oakmont, eight have won at least two majors. And of the nine men that won the US Open at Oakmont, six are in the World Golf Hall of Fame. I’d venture to think that Ángel Cabrera and Dustin Johnson have a pretty good chance of getting in there and making it eight of nine again, so the ghosts matter.”Cabrera was five over par when he won in 2007. Johnson closed at four under nine years later. Either outcome is possible here: if rain forecast for Friday and more seriously on Saturday hits, a softer site will trigger improved scoring. If Oakmont stays dry and becomes firmer, over par is likely to win.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last month, the PGA of America doubled down on its view that an upcoming rollback of the golf ball should be paused. ThePGA Touragrees. The USGA, in conjunction with the R&A, has proposed the plan from 2028 onwards. The USGA has no apparent desire to change approach. Golf could be on the brink of another civil war just as it is no closer to solving the one created by LIV’s arrival.Whan was asked whether he had a plan B on the golf ball. “We’ve announced our plan,” he responded. “I get this isn’t easy and everybody has got their own constituents. As an industry we have to be able to make small adjustments that are in the best interest of the game long-term, that we all know would be better 40 years from now if we were smart enough to make them today. We’ll make those.“Not everybody will like it. It’ll be high anxiety until we get there. But nobody is going to die. The game is going to be great. We’re going to prove that we can be better for future generations rather than to simply look the other way and know that in 40 or 50 years we’d be handing them something we could have made small adjustments on. We’re full-speed ahead on what we’ve announced. Those decisions have been made.”Big picture stuff can wait.

Farrell was expected to select the team to face Argentina from the 24 in Portugal, but Dalziel was adamant that club finalists will be considered. “Tadhg has the availability to be able to train and play this week with Leinster,” he said.“There are no real concerns in terms of his ability to come back to full training. Tadhg had returned to play and was playing. He’s now being modified in terms of [being] off-feet in the last few weeks. We’ve got no real concerns [around] when he comes back to full training and playing.“We will put our best team and our best foot forward for Argentina, with everybody available the squad will be together on Sunday, everybody in after the finals, then we will select and prepare that team that week.

Everyone has their own personality, but it’s excellent to see guys you’ve previewed, and have been a thorn in your side, you can use them now.”Meanwhile, Australia’s star turn Joseph Suaalii has declared himself fit for the series after recovering from a broken jaw. The 21-year-old signing from rugby league – who starred on his debut against England at Twickenham last November – was injured last month. “My face was really big for a bit, I was wearing a face mask everywhere,” he said. “It’s such an important time for myself and Australian rugby and I want to be playing, so obviously I was a little bit of nerves but … I had surgery maybe three weeks ago now and looking good going into the Lions.”England have called Henry Arundell into camp this week as they prepare for a clash with a France XV at Twickenham on Saturday week before a tour of Argentina and the US. Arundell, who joins Bath next season, has endured a torrid season with Racing 92 but, given his impending move back to the Premiership, Borthwick has called up the 22-year-old speedster for the first time in 20 months.Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsAustralia rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The 25-year-old Belgian tasted Olympic gold in the discipline last year and is also the doubletime-trial world champion. He showed his pedigree by blowing away a field containing Jonas Vingegaard and Tadej Pogacar.Evenpoel raced home 21 seconds ahead of Vingegaard, with Matteo Jorgenson a further 17 seconds back in third. Pogacar just missed the podium at 49 seconds behind Evenepoel, with Florian Lipowitz fifth and Mathieu van der Poel sixth.‘They named a sandwich after me’: Luke Rowe on life in the peloton, cobbles and Welsh ridersRead more“I’m surprised with the gaps,” Evenepoel said. “It’s quite big on a short TT so I’m very happy to have put over a second per kilometre on everybody and even two seconds per kilometre on some. I’m feeling good and it’s always nice to bring home a World Tour victory.”Evenepoel now slips on the leader’s yellow jersey for the 77th edition of the Dauphiné, which will be decided in the last three stages in the Alps from Friday. His win was the 1,000th victory for his Soudal Quick-Step team, created in 2003 by Patrick Lefevere under the name Quick Step-Davitamon. “I’m very happy with this victory,” Evenepoel said. “It’s a special day, I’m very proud to have done it.”Of the three frontrunners for the overall win, Pogacar finds himself the least well placed. Although the overall classification is far from set, the Slovenian is in eighth place, 38 seconds behind Evenepoel, while Vingegaard is 16 seconds back in fifth.Thursday’s stage five is a hilly 183km run from Saint-Priest to Mâcon.Explore more on these topicsCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

That is about £25m less than Paris Saint-Germain banked from Uefa for their 17-game Champions League-winning campaign, leading to concerns from clubs who have missed out.The Fifa Club World Cup, explained: everything you wanted to know about the tournamentRead moreBarcelona, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Milan are among the big clubs with large fanbases who have not qualified and unlessFifalifts its cap of 12 European entrants, expansion is the only way to ensure more European competitors.Next year’s men’s World Cup and the2031 Women’s World Cupwill involve 48 teams for the first time, so expanding the Club World Cup would be consistent with Fifa’s new tournament model. Fifa sources said that although serious discussions regarding expansion had yet to take place, talks with all stakeholders about the Club World Cup’s format and structure would be held after this summer’s tournament.Another possible change being pushed by Premier League clubs is increasing the cap of two clubs from one country, a restriction that led to Liverpool missing out despite meeting one of the qualifying criteria of having one of the best eight Champions League records of clubs who did not win the competition between 2021 and 2024. Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid qualified as Champions League winners during that period, with nine European clubs qualifying through Uefa rankings because Madrid won the competition twice, in 2022 and 2024.Fifa has waived the two-per-country limit for clubs that won their continental competition in that period, leading to Brazil having four clubs from four successive Copa Libertadores victories.The US have three clubs taking part after Los Angeles beat the Mexican side Club Américain a playofftriggered by the expulsion of Club León for a breach of multi-club ownership rules.In an interviewwith the Athleticlast week Fifa’s general secretary, Mattias Grafström, said all options were open for 2029. “For the future we are very open-minded to look at formats and so on that we will discuss with the clubs and with the confederations,” he said. “I believe strongly in the future of this competition.”Expanding the Club World Cup would be well received in particular by European clubs, whose commercial strength and global popularity are not reflected in this year’s entry list. A bigger tournament involving more of the bigger European clubs would also suit Fifa, which initially struggled to sell commercial deals for the competition.View image in fullscreenInter players board their flight to Los Angeles to take part in the 2025 Club World Cup.Photograph: Mattia Ozbot/Inter/Getty ImagesDazn agreed to pay $1bn for global TV rights in a deal that allows it to sublicense to other broadcasters on a regional basis, withChannel 5 buying the rightsfor 23 matches in the UK.The Dazn deal is being funded by a 10% investment in the company by Saudi Arabia’s SURJ Sports Investment and Saudi money is underpinning the tournament, with the country’s Public Investment Fund announced as tournament partners last week. The longtime Fifa sponsors Adidas, Coca-Cola and Visa have also come on board after initially resisting. Ticket sales have been mixed, however.Expansion would be resisted by the international players’ union, Fifpro, which along with the lobby group European Leagues has filed a legal complaint to the European Commissionaccusing Fifaof “abuse of dominance” for allegedly failing to consult them over the scheduling of the tournament.Fifa has denied the allegations and accused some leagues of “commercial self-interest” and “hypocrisy”.

So this was a decision that was best for my soul.”Why are members of the Super Bowl champion Eagles promoting a right-wing Christian wealth scheme?Read moreAnd one the Steelers believe is best for business, one of the reasons they put no pressure on Rodgers during the spring as he dealt with off-the-field issues that he has said included having multiple people in his inner circle battle cancer.Rodgers said those issues “have improved a bit,”clearing the way for him to joina team that has bounced from one quarterback to another since Ben Roethlisberger retired at the end of the 2021 season.He added that the Steelers’ long-time head coach Mike Tomlin, who has never had a losing season since taking over the team in 2007, was a major factor in his decision to return to football. The two stayed in contact over the last few months, producing what Rodgers called “some of the coolest conversations I’ve had in the game.”“It starts with Mike Tomlin,” Rodgers said. “I’ve been a fan of his for a long time. There’s a few iconic franchises in theNFL. I played for one of ‘em for 18 years. This is another one of those. There’s something special about obviously this area. So many great quarterbacks are from Pittsburgh. I feel like Pittsburgh has been a part of my career from the beginning.”Rodgers, who has worked out with recently acquired DK Metcalf in recent months, hopes some of the Steelers’ skill position players can join him at his home in Malibu, California, sometime before they report for the team’s full training camp on 23 July.If they do, they may get a chance to meet Rodgers’ wife. Rodgers was spotted wearing what looked like a wedding band when he signed his Steelers contract. Rodgers confirmed on Tuesday that he was married “a couple months” ago but declined to get into details. Rodgers has revealed little about his wife. During an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show last fall, he mentioned he was dating a woman named Brittani but offered no other details.Usually, Rodgers is not afraid to express his views about many topics, from vaccines to politics and beyond. But on Tuesday, he stuck to football.“It’s hard to think of anything in my life that’s positive that wasn’t impacted by directly or indirectly by playing this game,” he said. “So [I] just want to give love back to the game, enjoy it, pass on my knowledge to my teammates, and try and find ways to help lead the team.”The Steelers are unlikely to get the version of Rodgers who once cut a swathe through theNFLin his prime with the Green Bay Packers, winning four league MVP awards and a Super Bowl along the way. Rodgers’s tenure with his last team, the Jets, was brief and rocky. After a torn achilles ended his 2023 debut after just four snaps, he returned in 2024 to start all 17 games. Though he threw for 3,897 yards and 28 touchdowns, the Jets finished just 5-12, and Rodgers ranked outside the top 25 in most efficiency metrics. The team sputtered to a 3-7 record in one-score games.Without Rodgers, the Steelers would probably have started Mason Rudolph, who recently rejoined the team from the Tennessee Titans. However, Rudolph was a modest quarterback at best during his first stint with the team.Rodgers will face a familiar foe in Week 1 of the upcoming season: Pittsburgh are scheduled to play the Jets in their 2025 opener. They play the Packers in Week 8.Explore more on these topicsAaron RodgersPittsburgh SteelersNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

As a result, Iceland has got the world’s best gender equality legislation.”He added: “But we’re not asking for time off, we’re asking for time on. We’re downing tools at work so that we can spend time with our families.“At the very least we want to see six weeks of paternity leave at regular pay. That was recommended by thewomen and equalities committee on Tuesday. It should be a basic minimum – the average across Europe is eight weeks. The UK paternity leave is lowest in Europe, and 40th out of 43 developed countries.”The group says that better paternity leave would help close the gender pay gap by helping families share childcare and thereby make it less likely for new mothers to take career breaks or go part-time.View image in fullscreenThe campaigners say that better paternity leave would help close the gender pay gap.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesGabriel, an IT consultant who is taking four months of paternity leave, also cited a new longitudinal study that foundaffectionate relationships between fathers and their sons reduced the risk of domestic violence. He said: “There’s a lot of pressure on fathers to protect and provide, but the research shows the most important thing you can provide your kids with is your presence. The most important way to protect our boys is to be active, healthy role models in their lives day to day.”The prospect of a dad strike was greeted with some scepticism by those who are wary about public money funding fathers. Gabriel says: “We have had some people who accuse us of being a bunch of woke dads from east London. But the polling shows 90% of fathers these days want to be an active, more active, part of their children’s lives.”Duncan Dragonetti, from Wiltshire, arrived at the rally after changing his daughter Thomasin’s nappy in St James’s Park. Despite the parental chores, he said he had had a “great time” spending the last four months with his daughter.He disputes the claim that only middle-class families would benefit from better paternity pay, having witnessed the benefits of Sweden’s generous system while working for Spotify. “In Sweden, you get 480 days between both parents over 10 years. The dads have to take 90 days or they lose them, so everyone takes it and the equality in the workforce is far more balanced.”Police officers ‘mocked and ostracised’ for paternity leave in England and WalesRead moreHe added: “Most modern fathers are looking to be closer to their children and want to spend their time with them.”Richard Odufisan, who works at a construction company, came to the protest with his three-year-old son Ewa asleep in his pushchair. He says the real parenting only begins after the two-week statutory period, and that the rate should be much higher. He said: “The current rate is less than 50% of the national living wage. If you were taking on parenting as a job, legally you can’t pay some one that low. Increasing would create an incentive for fathers, particularly those on lower salaries, to take parental leave.”Sophie Barnett was one of number of new mothers who was taking part in the protest. She came with her nine-month-old daughter Penny and her husband, James, who was allowed only two weeks of paternity leave.She said: “You have to parent as a team, but after two weeks that team gets torn apart at a really crucial time for the baby – they don’t sleep through the night, they have to wake up every three hours to eat. James had go back to work running on empty. It was really disruptive for the whole household.”Explore more on these topicsMaternity & paternity rightsParents and parentingMenEmployee benefitsFamilynewsShareReuse this content"

But I think you have to distinguish between rights in law, and a preference for things to be a certain way.”Christine Jardine, the Liberal Democrat MP, pushed Falkner and the EHRC’s chief executive, John Kirkpatrick, on how trans people’s privacy could be protected in workplaces and socially “if they are going to be identified because they cannot use certain facilities”.Kirkpatrick said the watchdog hoped to provide “some appropriate guidance about how, respectfully, questions can be asked in the workplace or in services, and so on and so forth, in such a way as to respect privacy and dignity as far as is possible”.Asked if this would not still imperil people’s privacy, Falkner said that rights under article 8 of the Human Rights Act, connected to privacy, would not apply in such a case.Quizzed about how the changed rules about toilet use could be implemented, Falkner said it would primarily be about the “social contract”, adding: “We are not talking about people with badges coming along to enforce anything.”In another exchange, Falkner, who has been criticised by transgender groups for leading an organisation they argue is insufficiently protective of their rights, said almost all the abuse in the debate came from transgender people and their backers.Wednesday briefing: How Labour is handling the fallout from the equality act rulingRead more“One of the things that one notices is that the vast majority of that part of our population, which is particularly the women and girls part … the vast majority of those people who felt disadvantaged or felt the law was not supporting them did so in a dignified, respectful manner, frequently using the last resort of a tribunal or a court,” she said.“Let’s be clear. This supreme court ruling only covers 8,464 people, the holders of GRCs [gender recognition certificates]. So in terms of changing things at all, those are the people affected. But the level of agitation that they can cause in terms of personal attacks, libellous attacks, defamation, where our family members are affected, our intimate family members have to think about how they are going about their place of work and so on, has got to stop.”Explore more on these topicsEquality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)TransgenderGenderEquality Act 2010newsShareReuse this content"

He said that if the UK was not prepared to increase defence budgets to the 3.5% figure, “you had better learn to speak Russian”.Earlier on Wednesday, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, reiterated commitments given in February by Starmer to increase defence spending to 2.6% of GDP by April 2027. That amounts to a cash total of £71bn, an increase of £10.7bn from the expected £60.3bn in 2024/5.Treasury documents also repeated there was “an ambition to reach 3% in the next parliament as economic and fiscal conditions allow”. Senior defence insiders argued that restating the existing position was a misstep and failed to acknowledge that Nato was expected to agree further increases in spending in the next fortnight.A week ago, the UK released a “Nato first” defence review based on the idea that spending would rise to 2.5% by 2027 and 3% in the next parliament, but one insider suggested there could have been more money for the review team to allocate had the exercise had been delayed several months.“The sequencing of the defence review with the Nato summit has not been well thought out,” one defence source argued. An extra 1 percentage point of GDP would amount to about £30bn, though the exact figure would depend on the size of the UK economy at the time.A second source said last-minute consideration had been given to delaying the defence review until the autumn but it was felt this was in breach of commitments given by defence secretary, John Healey, to publish the document in the spring.Downing Street pointed to a readout of Starmer’s meeting with Rutte that it released on Monday. That said the two men had agreed that Nato allies “still needed to go further and faster to ensure stability and security and reinforce defence industries for the future”, implying the UK acknowledged the case for extra spending.It said “the leaders also discussed future funding proposals for Nato and underscored the importance of going further to step up on national resilience and protect critical national infrastructure,” though the statement did not refer to any specific spending figures.Nato’s new defence plan, designed to deter Russia from attacking its eastern flank, envisages a fivefold increase in air and missile defence, and allies buying thousands more tanks and armoured vehicles, millions more artillery shells and a doubling of logistics, supply, transportation and medical support.Last week, defence insiders predicted that the UK wouldeventually be forced into agreeingto an increase in military spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2035, although the exact date remains a subject of negotiation. But the discussions appear to be continuing until close to the start of the summit on 24 June.Spain is the only Nato member that has publicly declared it is not prepared to meet the proposed 3.5% commitment itself. But last week, Margarita Robles, the country’s defence minister, said Madrid would not veto an alliance-wide decision to increase the spending target either. Nato traditionally makes decisions by consensus.Starmer is due to speak again to Rutte at the G7 summit in Canada at the weekend.Separately, the US announced it had conducted a quick review of its participation in the joint Aukus nuclear-powered submarine project with Australia and the UK that was agreed under the Biden administration. A US withdrawal could put the future of the project in doubt, and comes at a time when Washington is pressing Canberra to increase defence spending to 3.5% of GDP.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyNatoMark RutteKeir StarmerMilitaryEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Health officials saw this when they first inspected the gowns in the UK in September 2020 and refused to release them for use in the NHS.In his opening submission to the judge, Mrs Justice Cockerill, Stanley referred to a statement made for the case by a DHSC official responsible for quality control of medical products.“His evidence is categorical; his team would not have considered using the gowns as sterile surgical gowns,” the submission says. “Without the relevant assurances of conformity that the gowns met sterility requirements, the potential impact on safety was such that they could seriously harm or kill patients and so could not be released for use.”The DHSC awarded the gowns contract, and another contract worth £80.85m to supply face masks, after Mone first approached the thenCabinet Office minister Michael Govein May 2020. The contracts were processed via the then Conservative government’s “VIP lane”, which gave high priority to companies recommended by people with political connections. Mone, who rose to prominence running her lingerie company, Ultimo, was appointed to theHouse of Lordsby David Cameron in 2015.Mone and her husband, the Isle of Man-based businessman Doug Barrowman, had for yearspublicly distancedthemselves from the company until in November 2023 the couple confirmed their involvement and said Barrowman was an investor and chair of the PPE Medpro “consortium”.Setting out how the gowns contract was awarded, the DHSC said in its submission that Mone had “pressed Medpro’s case” with officials.Mone did not attend the hearing but Barrowman was in the courtroom, sitting with his lawyers. Neither they nor any PPE Medpro employees who were involved in securing the contract, or members of the consortium, are listed to give evidence.Charles Samek KC, representing PPE Medpro, said the gowns did comply with the required standards for sterility, and the DHSC had approved the process before it awarded the contract.“The secretary of state [for health] knew everything there was to know about my client’s offer, all cards were on the table face up, and they entered into this contract … with their eyes wide open,” Samek said.The high court action is separate to the investigation by the National Crime Agency into whether Mone and Barrowmancommitted any criminal offencesduring the process of procuring the contracts. The couple have denied any criminal wrongdoing.In his submission, Samek said there was a concern that the NCA investigation, which he described as “long-running and seemingly never-ending”, was being conducted at the same time as the DHSC’s high court claim “to exert pressure” on the company and people connected to it. The NCA investigation was “hanging … like Damocles’ sword over PPE Medpro, without ever seemingly being progressed”, his submission said.The high court trial is scheduled to last five weeks.Explore more on these topicsMichelle MoneCoronavirusnewsShareReuse this content"

An area twice the size of Luxembourg has been consumed by flames in an average recent year, killing people, destroying homes and wildlife and sending megatonnes of planet-heating emissions into the air.TheEuropean court of auditorspraised the decision to devote more money to preventing fires but said European-funded projects were not always spent where they could make the biggest difference. In Greece, authorities were using a map drawn up in 1980 to assess the risk of forest fires. In Portugal, one area selected as a priority for funds contained a zone that was underwater due to a recently built dam.The auditors raised the concerns against the backdrop of a sharp increase in EU funds to prevent and respond to forest fires. EU funding has increased through the €650bnCovid recovery fund, launched in 2020 with the aim of helping EU member states recover from the pandemic-induced crisis by strengthening environmental policies and their technological base.Fires drove record loss of world’s forests last year, ‘frightening’ data showsRead moreGreece, for example, is on course to receive €837m of recovery funds between 2020 and 2026 to combat forest fires, having benefited from €49m in EU funds during the previous seven-year budget period. Spain and to a lesser extent Portugal have also seen a sharp uplift in EU funds dedicated to forest fires.The €650bn recovery and resilience fund, almost entirely funded by borrowing on markets, has already been criticised by auditors aslacking transparency and accountability.The latest report highlights how governments have felt pressure to spend money quickly, leading to questionable decisions. Portugal’s rural fire management agency, for instance, was not involved in decisions on how to spend Covid recovery funds worth €615m over seven years to combat forest fires. A Portuguese authority due to receive fire engines could not meet a 48-hour deadline from Lisbon to outline its needs, and ultimately key decisions on the fleet of 55 vehicles were made by national officials.EU funds can be spent on activities to prevent or respond quickly to fires, such as cutting back vegetation, or building roads to ensure firefighting trucks quickly reach forested areas. The temporary nature of the Covid recovery funds, which expire in 2026, also raised questions about future funding. Vegetation, for example, needs to be cut back every three to four years to maintain firebreaks.Nikolaos Milionis, the ECA member in charge of the inquiry, said: “We found that on a positive note more human money is being spent on prevention of fires. However, the way the European-funded projects are selected means the money does not always go where it could make the biggest difference.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

If reforested, this would remove 2.2bn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, about the same as all the nations in the European Union.Previous maps have suggested much larger areas have the potential for regrowing trees but were criticised for including important ecosystems like savannahs and not considering the impact on the millions of people who live in or depend on forests.Tree bark plays vital role in removing methane from atmosphere, study findsRead moreThe researchers behind the new maps built onprevious workbut employed a deliberately conservative approach in order to shine a spotlight on those places with the highest potential and the fewest problems.They focused only on dense, closed-canopy forests and excluded areas that had suffered recent wildfires. The result was a map showing 195 million hectares of reforestation opportunity, an area equivalent to the size ofMexicobut up to 90% smaller than previous maps. They provided further options that, for example, avoid the risk of social conflict with forest peoples, which reduced the potential CO2 removal to 1.5bn tonnes a year.Reforestation opportunity maps are crucial because regrowing trees is the largest and cheapest option for taking CO2 out of the atmosphere, but tree initiatives need to focus on the most suitable areas to maximise their impact.“Reforestation is not a substitute for cutting fossil fuel emissions, but even if we were to drive down emissions tomorrow, we still need to remove excess CO2 from the atmosphere,” said Dr Susan Cook-Patton, at The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and a senior author of the new study,published in the journal Nature Communications. “Many, many years of evolution have gone into trees figuring out how to suck CO2 from the atmosphere and lock it into carbon stores, so it’s ready to scale now.”“As the number of climate-fuelled disasters stack up worldwide, it’s increasingly obvious that we can’t waste time on well-meaning but hazily-understood interventions,” she said. “We must fast-track our focus toward the places with greatest benefits for people and nature and the fewest downsides, the places most likely to be win-win. This study will help leaders and investors do just that.”Maps showing best opportunities for global reforestationProf Simon Lewis, at University College London and not part of the study team, said: “There have been a series of well-known studies of global reforestation potential that have come up with wildly high numbers. This new study is the antidote to such hyperbole. New forests in the lowest risk areas globally would remove about 5% of humans’ CO2 emissions each year – important, but not a silver bullet.”The options the scientists created beyond their 195mHa base map prioritised three broad criteria: avoiding social conflicts, improving biodiversity and water quality, and highlighting places where governments already had reforestation goals, making action more politically possible.“There’s always a set of values or motivations that goes into the way you produce the map, and the answer that you get,” said Kurt Fesenmyer, also at TNC and lead author of the new analysis. The area of land that met every criteria was small – 15mHa – so the researchers hope governments and NGOs will use theirinteractive mapsto highlight the most suitable solutions in their own countries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

These regions were particularly focused in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia, as well asBrazil, which is hosting the UN’s Cop30 climate summit in November.Lewis said the approach taken in the new study made sense: “Who wants to see the natural grasslands like the Serengeti covered in trees and not lions, elephants and other wildlife? And planting trees in places that burn isn’t going to store carbon long-term, and so of course these areas should be excluded.”However, he added: “The most conservative map removes potential forest restoration across almost all of Africa and Southeast Asia, due to fears of [land rights] conflict. This risks perpetuating poverty, if investments in nature avoid poor countries with limited governance. Plans to invest in nature to improve local livelihoods and also benefit the climate and biodiversity should be seized, as these often go hand-in-hand.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisTrees and forestsBrazilAmericasCanadaGlobal researchMexiconewsShareReuse this content"

That is the stark assessment of a new business offering an innovative alternative: having your loved one’s ashes made into a reef and anchored to the British seabed.There are increasing concerns about the environmental cost of traditional funerals: a single burial generates 833kg of CO2, while a typical cremation has a footprint of about 400kg of CO2. In the US alone, 1.6m tonnes of concrete and 14,000 tonnes of steel is used each year for building graves. Chemicals from embalming processes seep into the soil.But now a British startup,Resting Reef, is redefining what a cemetery can be by turning the ashes of humans into memorial reef structures. “Cemeteries should be places that reconnect us with nature and remind us that we’re part of a larger ecosystem,” said Aura Pérez, the company’s co-founder, who met her business partner, Louise Skajem, when they were doing their master’s degrees at the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London.Resting Reef uses aquamation, an alkaline process for cremation, to combine pet or human ashes with crushed oyster shells and concrete into a material proven to enhance marine growth.“Artificial oyster reefs can help regenerate marine growth but 85% have been lost due to human activities, so we are using animal and human ashes to replace them,” said Perez.View image in fullscreenThe memorial reef structures are created by combining pet or human ashes with crushed oyster shells and concrete.Photograph: Resting ReefThe formula is then 3D-printed into reef structures designed to create diverse habitats for a variety of fish species through differing heights, textures and tunnel systems. When the reef is ready, it is anchored to the seabed at a depth of about 10 metres where it will regenerate marine biodiversity, filter water and prevent coastal erosion. The reefs can capture as much as 2.2m kg of CO2in three years.Resting Reef began incorporating the ashes of pets into artificial reefs in Bali, Indonesia, last year. But demand has been so great that the company is opening up the offer to human ashes. The company is working to secure licences to replace degraded seabeds with artificial reefs at the Plymouth Breakwater on the south coast of England, a 1,560m stone breakwater protecting the Plymouth Sound.“It’s time for the death industry to change: we want to shift the industry from focusing on death to life and regenerate growth,” Pérez said.The business has won the Terra Carta Design Lab, a global competition established by King Charles and the British designer Jony Ive, and an Innovate UK grant. The co-founders were named in the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for social impact in Europe.“We conducted a pilot reef in Bali in 2024, collaborating with the local Balinese community,” Pérez said. “We have placed 24 memorial reefs for beloved cats, dogs, lizards, fish and exotic birds for owners in the US, UK and other countries.“The pilot project attracted 59 fish species and achieved fish diversity 12 times greater than nearby degraded areas. This is very exciting.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Human memorials have an initial cost of £3,900, although families can pay more for a range of curated activities at the site.Prof Rick Stafford, who specialises in artificial reefs and marine biodiversity at Bournemouth University, praised the company for increasing local biodiversity.“Resting Reefs is different from other companies because it focuses on enhancing biodiversity close to the shore,” he said. “It’s entirely in line with environmental policies like protecting 30% of the world’s land and sea by 2030, and the marine net gain policy to ensure developments in the marine environment leave the ecosystem in a better state than before, with a focus on improving biodiversity.”Peter Holt, director and co-founder of the Plymouth-based Ships Project, a marine consultancy service, also praised the business. “I’m very excited by the project and its potential to improve marine habitats and support a range of maritime industries,” he said.“The project has received support from the whole community here, including the king’s harbour master, because it will potentially boost diving tourism and fishing, while aligning with the Plymouth Sound national marine park’s goals to re-engage the public with marine life.”Explore more on these topicsMarine lifeEthical and green livingDeath and dyingnewsShareReuse this content"

Motoring past Clapboard Island, he points to a floating wooden platform where mussels have been seeded alongside ribbons of edible seaweed.“This is our most productive mussel site,” says Briggs, the farm manager forBangs Island Mussels, a Portland sea farm that grows, harvests and sells hundreds of thousands of pounds of shellfish and seaweed each year. “When we come here, we get the biggest, fastest-growing mussels with the thickest shells and the best quality. To my mind, unscientifically, it’s because of the kelp.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenZoe Benisek, oyster lead at Bangs Island Mussels, harvesting kelp. The seaweed changes water chemistry enough to lower the levels of carbon dioxide to nourish the musselsA growing body of science supports Briggs’s intuition. The Gulf of Maine is uniquely vulnerable to ocean acidification, which can impede shell development in mussels, clams, oysters and lobster, threatening an industry that employs hundreds of people and generates$85m to $100m (£63m to £74m) annually.Atmospheric carbon dioxide from fossil fuels is the main driver of declining ocean pH,increasing the acidity of the world’s oceansby more than 40% since the preindustrial era and by more than 15% since 1985. Add carbon runoff from growing coastal communities, regular inflows of colder, more acidic water from Canada, and intense thermal stress – the Gulf of Maine is warmingthree times faster than the global average– and you’re left with a delicate marine ecosystem and key economic resource under threat.Enter kelp. The streams of glistening, brownish-green seaweed that Bangs Island seeds on lines under frigid November skies and harvests in late spring are a natural answer to ocean acidification because they devour carbon dioxide.Sensors placed near kelp lines in Casco Bay over the past decadehave shown that growing seaweed changes water chemistry enough to lower the levels of carbon dioxide in the immediate vicinity, nourishing nearby molluscs.Map of Maine and islands“We know that, in general, for shell builders, ocean acidification is bad, and we know that kelp do better in a high-CO2environment,” says Susie Arnold, the senior ocean scientist at the Island Institute, a non-profit climate and community organisation in Rockland,Maine, and a pioneer of the Bangs Island water experiments.Working with the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, an independent Maine-based research organisation, Arnold and others begantesting the water off Chebeague Island in 2015 “to see if we could detect a difference between water chemistry in the middle of all that kelp and far away from it”, she says. “We planted juvenile mussels inside and outside the kelp, and we were able to show that the mussels inside the kelp had a thicker shell. Now you see Bangs Island growing kelp around their mussels because they can make a profit on kelp and also buffer the mussels.”View image in fullscreenThe Bangs Island crew harvesting kelp on their boat in the Gulf of MaineThe CEO and co-owner of Bangs Island Mussels, Matt Moretti, studied marine biology in college and grad school, helped raise baby lobsters at the New England Aquarium, and worked on an oyster farm before buying the sea farm with his father in 2010. Within a year, they had started growing kelp alongside the mussels in an approach known as integrated multi-trophic aquaculture.Conceptually, what we do is very simple. But adding all the pieces together is a really, big complicated puzzleMatt Moretti“Even before we started farming mussels, I was interested in that concept as an environmentally friendly way of farming, and of farming an ecosystem rather than a single species,” Moretti says from his bare-bones upstairs office in Bangs Island’s warehouse on the Portland pier.As the kelp harvest grew, Moretti realised they needed a way to stabilise the seaweed, which didn’t last long after it came out of the water. For a while they dried it themselves, hanging it in the warehouse and on the docks. Now, they sell the entire fresh seaweed catch to a local processor, which turns it into fermented foods such as kimchi, among other products.View image in fullscreenGillian Prostko, chief science officer at Bangs Island Mussels. The harvested kelp is sold to a processor and turned into fermented foods such as kimchi“We always suspected that there was this positive interaction between the mussels and kelp, and we suspected that because kelp photosynthesises, it sucks carbon out of the water, then therefore it must be good for the ocean and good for the mussels,” Moretti says. Bigelow’s water testing has proven that “we’re having a positive impact”.Nichole Price, the director of Bigelow’s Centre for Seafood Solutions, collaborated with Arnold on those early experiments and continues to monitor the water around Bangs Island mussel and kelp lines, an effort that has expanded to include water monitoring at seaweed farms from Alaska to Norway. Ina paper published this yearin the journal Nature Climate Change, Price, Arnold, and a host of co-authors documented yet another way in which seaweed farms can contribute to the health of the world’s oceans: by trapping carbon at the bottom of the sea.“When you harvest, you’re not pulling up every last bit of seaweed,” Price says. “We’ve been diving under farms during harvest, and you can see the bits and pieces that rain down. Then there’s a culling process, the bits and pieces that get tossed over, and that’s what this paper has measured: the unusable, unsellable parts of the harvest that end up on the sea floor.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenMatt Moretti, founder of Bangs Island Mussels (left) and farm manager Tom BriggsThose discarded seaweed scraps can contribute to what is known as passive deposition of carbon. “Fingers crossed, it gets covered with sediment fast enough that it’s taken out of the global carbon cycle,” Price says.Given the environmental and financial benefits of growing kelp and shellfish together, you might think everyone would be doing it. But co-farming mussels and kelp at scale requires more than just planting and harvesting. With five boats, a plankton monitoring programme, and tanks on the ground floor of the warehouse where baby mussels from a nearby hatchery are carefully seeded on to lines before being placed in the ocean, Bangs Island is part farm, part science lab.Changes in mussel-spawning and seed-collection cycles in recent years have forced Moretti and his staff to pay much closer attention to the surrounding water and its inhabitants, from barnacles – a nuisance to shellfish farmers because they set on mussels – to the microscopic larvae of tunicates, pestilent sea squirts that seeded on nearly all of the farm’s mussel lines several years ago, crowding out the shellfish and almost sinking the business.How the ‘evil twin’ of the climate crisis is threatening our oceansRead more“Conceptually, what we do is very simple: we grow mussels, harvest them, sell them,” Moretti said. “But adding all the pieces together is a really big, complicated puzzle.”Today, Bangs Island harvests about 600,000lb (270,000kg) of mussels and 100,000lb of seaweed a year; last fall, they began farming oysters. The oysters, along with about half the mussels, grow in proximity to kelp.“Climate change, ocean acidification, is a global problem. And when you try to think about it, like, what you can do? It’s so daunting,” Moretti says. “But when you think about us farming kelp in the ocean, it’s really the only way we’ve ever been able to figure out to have a local-scale mitigation of this global problem. It’s something we can do here that can help the waters around us that actually has a significant impact.”View image in fullscreenKelp ready for harvesting in the Gulf of MaineExplore more on these topicsOur acidifying oceansOceansMaineMarine lifeClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsFishing industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It said there were no outstanding public protection issues and it was not the tribunal’s role to punish him.Thompson was the on-duty consultant at King’s College hospital (KCH), in south London, on 29 August 2021, two days before Martha’s death from sepsis, which led last year tothe introduction of Martha’s rule, giving the right to a second medical opinion in English hospitals.Doctor guilty of misconduct over case of girl, 13, whose death led to Martha’s ruleRead moreThe tribunal previously found that Thompson, who left the hospital at 3pm, failed to escalate Martha’s treatment to an intensive care unit or to conduct a direct in-person review and assessment, including of a rash. The duty registrar had called Thompson at home when Martha developed the rash.In 2022,a coroner ruled she would probably have survivedif doctors had identified the warning signs of her rapidly deteriorating condition and transferred her to intensive care earlier, which her parents had asked doctors to do.Robin Ince, the chair of the panel at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, said among the “exceptional circumstances” dictating that no further action was necessary was that “there was no allegation or evidence that Prof Thompson either caused or contributed to Martha’s death”.He said that the misconduct and impairment finding was of itself a “significant stigma” and would be “a continuing embarrassment” for Thompson.“A sufficiently clear message had already been sent to the profession and to the public (that even such an experienced doctor as Prof Thompson could still make serious errors of clinical judgment for which he will be called to account),” said Ince. “The public would be aware that this finding would remain a stain on Prof Thompson’s reputation for the rest of his life.”Christopher Rose, representing the General Medical Council, had argued that Thompson should be suspended for an appropriate period, as taking no action would be inconsistent with the tribunal’s impairment finding. He also claimed it was necessary to maintain standards and public confidence in the profession.But Ince said the lack of sanction did not detract from the message that the tribunal’s determination on impairment sent.He said that any suspension “would result in the loss of Prof Thompson’s invaluable expertise as a hepatologist, both nationally and internationally … which would not be in the public interest”, adding: “The tribunal was of the view that this decision to take no action did not jeopardise public protection, particularly given its comments as to the [lack of] risk of repetition.”After the sanctions finding, Martha’s parents, Merope Mills, a senior editor at the Guardian, and her husband, Paul Laity, said: “King’s College hospital’s own report into Martha’s death made it clear that the high-status consultants on her ward had a poor relationship with paediatric intensive care, which helps to explain why Martha wasn’t referred there when, as every expert has agreed, she should have been. We will never understand why experienced doctors, with elevated reputations, took such a big risk with her life.”Martha sustained an injury to her pancreas when she fell off her bike on holiday in Wales. She was transferred to intensive care at KCH on 30 August 2021, by which time she had septic shock, according to a serious incident report produced for the hospital.In March,the Commons health and social care committee heardthat Martha’s rule had been invoked more than 2,000 times, which had led to more than 300 patients having an improvement in their care and more than 100 patients being escalated to intensive care or equivalent.Explore more on these topicsHospitalsNHSHealthDoctorsLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

In October 2024, Mohamed Iidow was convicted of the NHS worker’s rape and manslaughter, in a highly significant ruling that found oral rape as a cause of death. He had pleaded not guilty but chose not to give evidence in his defence.It is alleged that the evening before Shotter was found dead, one of the officers now facing disciplinary proceedings was approached by a member of the public who told them that a woman in the park was in a vulnerable situation. The officer and a colleague were nearby dealing with a separate incident. The officer advised the member of the public to call the police for additional support.The IOPC director, David Ford, said: “After careful consideration of the evidence, we have decided two Met police officers should face a misconduct meeting for allegedly failing to safeguard Ms Shotter. On the previous evening, one of the officers was notified by a member of the public that a woman was in a vulnerable situation. The following day, Ms Shotter was, sadly, found dead in the park.“The constables – who were both probationers – are alleged to have failed to properly risk assess, document or to take any real action in relation to the information reported to them.”Shotter’s family made a complaint to Scotland Yard about the actions of the two officers. The Met investigated the complaint and concluded that both officers should be subject to unsatisfactory performance procedures rather than face disciplinary proceedings.Ford said: “We were asked by Ms Shotter’s family to review the force’s handling of the family’s complaint and, in June 2025, we disagreed with the Met’s decision. We have directed them to arrange a misconduct meeting for the two officers, who have a case to answer for an alleged breach of the police professional standards of behaviour relating to duties and responsibilities.“It will now be for the panel to consider the evidence and determine if the case is proven and, if so, decide on the most appropriate outcome.”Shotter’s mother, Dr Cas Shotter Weetman, a lead advanced cardiology practitioner for the NHS, welcomed the IOPC decision. “We are enormously happy about this decision. Common sense has been shown here. I know Nat would be delighted about this. It’s another step on the road in our fight for justice for her,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the Beatle revealed his more prosaic side in a letter penned in 1962 to his future wife Cynthia Powell, in which he declared: “I wish I was on the way to your flat with the Sunday papers and chocies and a throbber.”The intimate missive, which includes a complaint about his bandmate Paul McCartney’s snoring, is now being sold at auction by Christie’s with a £30,000 to £40,000 estimate.Written over five nights after concerts during their Hamburg residency in April 1962, Lennon, then aged 21, wrote: “I love love love you and I’m missing you like mad … I wish I was on the way to your flat with the Sunday papers and chocies and a throbber.“I wonder why all the newspapers wrote about Stu … I haven’t seen Astrid since the day we arrived I’ve thought of going to see her but I would be so awkward.“Paul’s leaping about on my head (he’s in a bunk on top of me and he’s snoring) … Shurrup Mcarntey [sic]!”View image in fullscreenJohn and Cynthia Lennon in April 1964.Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-KeystoneHe then tells Cynthia he does not like the idea of McCartney’s then girlfriend, Dot Rhone, moving in with her, saying: “We would never be alone really … imagine having her there all the time when we were in bed – and imagine Paul coming all the time.”He adds: “I love you please wait for me and don’t be sad and work hard be a clever little Cyn Powell.”Lennon and Cynthia, who was a year older than him, had been in a relationship for four years, having met at Liverpool College of Art.They married in August 1962 and their son, Julian, was born in April 1963, weeks after Beatlemania exploded with the release of their chart-topping first album, Please Please Me.The couple divorced in 1968 and she later claimed he had inflicted physical abuse on her throughout their relationship, including slapping her face in a fit of jealousy.The handwritten letter was sold by Cynthia to a Swedish collector in 1991 and changed hands to the Swedish vendor in 1993.Thomas Venning, the head of books and manuscripts at Christie’s, said: “There are some smutty and funny bits and you sense his personality on the page, unlike his later letters which are more guarded and preachy. It provides an early insight into the Beatles from their time in Hamburg which was so important to their development as a band.”Lennon was murdered by Mark David Chapman in New York in 1980.The sale takes place on 9 July.Explore more on these topicsJohn LennonThe BeatlesnewsShareReuse this content"

He told his parents in a suicide note that he had acted of his “own free will”.The young man, who had left the school two years ago without completing his studies, had apologised to his parents and older siblings but had not disclosed a motive for his attack, officials said.The shooting – the worst in Austria’s postwar history – took place in 17 minutes on Tuesday morning, just after the start of the third lesson of the day. Many children were sitting exams at the time. Eyewitnesses described how the perpetrator had fired through classroom doors using a shotgun, subsequently shooting at victims with a pistol. Pupils were told by teachers to lie flat on the floor and to barricade themselves in rooms, using chairs to block the doors.Police arrived at the scene at 10.06am after receiving a call from a woman living close to the school at 10am, who had heard shots.View image in fullscreenAustria has entered a three-day period of national mourning.Photograph: Alex Halada/AFP/Getty ImagesThe killer’s mother had reportedly alerted police 24 minutes after receiving what has been described as a farewell video from her son. But by the time she had seen it, he was already carrying out the attack.Of the nine people shot dead at the school, six were female and three were male. The pupils were Austrian citizens, aged between 14 and 17, and one Polish citizen. The eldest, a 59-year-old female teacher, died from her injuries on Tuesday evening.The killer, described in local media as a loner with apparently no social media presence and who had only one friend, killed himself in the school building. His body was discovered by armed police in a toilet cubicle.According to police, the alleged attacker had been legally in possession of the shotgun and Glock pistol. He had also reportedly been deemed fit to own the weapons, according to a standard psychological test.The killings have sparked a heated debate about weapon possession in Austria, which is among the most heavily weaponised countries inEuropeand where most 18-year-olds have easy access to buying guns. Officially, its 9 million citizens own more than 1m weapons, although experts have said the real figure is probably much higher.The homemade pipe bomb, discovered by police on Tuesday evening in the flat where Arthur A lived with his mother, was found to be ineffectual. But police on Wednesday said they believed the youth had planned to detonate the bomb at the school.View image in fullscreenA minute’s silence was observed across Austria on Wednesday morning in tribute to the victims of the shooting.Photograph: Matej Povse/Getty ImagesAcross the country, Austrians held a minute’s silence in tribute to the victims on Wednesday morning, at the start of three days of national mourning. Public transport came to a halt, the state broadcaster, ORF, paused its TV and radio programming, and church bells sounded in mourning, while flags were flown at half mast on public buildings.Outside the BORG Dreierschützengasse high school, current and former pupils, as well as other Graz residents, were hugging, sobbing and leaning on each other for support as they arrived to place candles and flowers. Some wove the stems through the mesh of the fence.Paul Nitsche, a priest who is also a teacher at the school, had returned for the one minute’s silence and to pay tribute to his colleague and pupils who had lost their lives.He described hearing the first shots when he was working in an empty classroom while his 8th-year pupils sat their exams in a nearby room. After initially dismissing the noises, he decided to run.“Suddenly the silence was broken by the sound of bullets. At first I thought it was fireworks or something because anything else was out of the question. Then, I thought, maybe it’s an attack. I decided to run,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe mayor and vice-mayor of Graz lay flowers to pay their respect at a central square in the south-eastern city.Photograph: Erwin Scheriau/APA/AFP/Getty Images“I went out and across the corridor, and down the stairs and that’s when I saw the attacker very briefly, with his weapon, trying to shoot through the lock of a classroom door – five metres away from me. I was scared. I just kept running downstairs. When I saw a female pupil lying on the floor and a female teacher then I knew it was true.”Sharon, a social worker and mother of a 14-year-old boy who survived the attack, wiped away tears as she described receiving a call from him yesterday morning while she was driving. “He said to me: ‘Mum, I’m OK, you don’t need to worry about me.’ It was the first I’d heard of the incident,” she said, paying tribute to a teacher who had told her son and his classmates to jam the classroom door with chairs.Sharon said she had driven to a nearby hall where pupils had been brought to safety.“We were mainly mothers in the room,” she said. “I knew my son was OK, but others didn’t. Some people were screaming when they knew their children had been hit. You can’t imagine the emotional turmoil. My son lost one of his best friends, and knows at least two of those who died,” she said. “We feel hollow and devastated.”Laura, 19, who lives next to the school and is in the middle of her exams, came to place a candle outside the school, where a close friend is a pupil. “They’re going to have to rethink the security of schools, like introducing metal detectors, because no one is going to want to go to school after this,” she said.View image in fullscreenA memorial in front BORG Dreierschützengasse high school, where the shooting took place on Tuesday morning.Photograph: Alex Halada/AFP/Getty ImagesLaura said she had known of the attacker, who had been in the same class as a friend for a year before leaving without taking exams. The friend could not recall him being bullied, as has been cited in some local media articles as a potential motive.People in Graz had queued into the night to donate blood that could be used to treat 11 wounded people, aged 15 to 26, eight of whom were said by authorities to be Austrian, two Romanian, and one Iranian. On Wednesday, two of the injured remained in intensive care, although all were said to be in a stable condition. One who had been shot in the face was undergoing a second emergency operation, authorities said.Among the quiet residential community in Kalsdorf, the southern Graz district where Arthur A lived with his mother, neighbours spoke of their shock at finding out that he had lived among them.Thomas Gasser, 38, a supermarket manager who lived directly opposite Arthur A, had been sitting on his garden terrace when armed police arrived at about 11.30am on Tuesday to raid the home he shared with his mother.“It was eerie. They quietly crept up on the house, around 15 to 20 officers, fully clad with weapons. Nothing, literally nothing happens in this neighbourhood. The idea that this man with murderous intentions and a pipe bomb was living opposite us is hard to fathom, and very unsettling,” he said.Arthur A, he said, “had lived here for five years, but was very reserved. He always had his headphones in, dressed in dark clothes and wore a cap pulled down over his eyes”.Walking past the flat where the gunman lived, Natalia Chalakova, 19, originally from Bulgaria, expressed her shock that the attacker was from the neighbourhood. “No one could stop talking about it when we met at school this morning for our exams, and no one could really concentrate,” she said. “The most upset of any kind that usually happens here are disputes on the playground with kids fighting over their toys. To have a mass murderer in our midst – this is an American story, not an Austrian one.”Explore more on these topicsAustriaEuropeChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

Since coming to power, Tusk’s government has faced fierce criticism from the incumbent president, Andrzej Duda, a former PiS European lawmaker, with fears Duda could use his robust veto powers to block some measures.But theunexpected winof Karol Nawrocki, a Donald Trump-backed, previously little-known historian linked with the PiS, over the pro-European centrist mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, put a question mark over the government’s ability to deliver on its program.Analysts partly blamed the result on the government’s track record and Tusk’s personal unpopularity, with voters reportedly unwilling to give too much power to one political camp.A recent CBOS poll showed that 44% of voters were critical of the government, 32% supportive and 20% neutral. Tusk himself was even more unpopular, with 53% having a negative view of him and just 35% positive.During a bruising seven-hour debate in parliament, more than 260 MPs took to the podium. Tusk strongly defended his government’s track record and lamented its inability to communicate its successes to the electorate.“If we told our story even half as well as we actually governed, we would be winning election after election,” he said.Acknowledging the significance of Nawrocki’s win, Tusk said: “This is not an earthquake, but let’s call things for what they are: we are facing two and a half years of very hard … work in [political] conditions that are not going to improve.”But he insisted the government still had a clear political majority to pursue its measures, despite “impatience, sometimes disappointment or anger” among its voters.“I know the taste of victory, I know the bitterness of defeat, but I don’t know the word surrender,” he quipped.Opposition lawmakers lined up to criticise the government for showing little ambition and slow progress on its key promises, with too much focus on blaming the previous administration for all problems.Speaking to reporters after the vote, Tusk said he had “needed that vote for obvious reasons” as he had faced “a lot of noise” about his and the government’s future.He said he intended to “cut off all speculation” and move the narrative on as his ministers had “two years to make amends” and win over the public before the 2027 parliamentary elections.Under Tusk’s plans to reassert control, the government will now appoint a “heavyweight” spokesperson next week to overhaul its communications strategy, and will follow through with a ministerial reshuffle in July to get in shape before Nawrocki takes office in August.Explore more on these topicsPolandDonald TuskEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

After all, as noted above, the Department of Homeland Security is seeking to remove the petitioner based not only on the Secretary of State’s determination – but also on a second basis, the Petitioner’s alleged failure to accurately complete his lawful-permanent-resident application,” Farbiarz wrote.He added that his findings “have no impact on efforts to remove the petitioner for reasons other than the Secretary of State’s determination”.Khalil has been held in a detention facility in Louisiana since March as his case moved through the courts. InApril, an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled the Trump administration could move ahead with Khalil’s deportation, although Farbiarz, in a separate case on the legality of the detention, ordered the government not to remove him. Late last month, Farbiarz wrote that the government’s effort was likely unconstitutional.His arrest was the first in the wave of arrests of students as part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on pro-Palestinian activism in US universities. In the weeks after Khalil’s arrest, the government arrested an internationalTufts studentwho had co-authored a campus newspaper op-ed about Gaza in the street and a Columbia student attending anaturalization interviewand sought to deport aColumbia studentwho had lived in the US since she was seven.Khalil was taken into custody on 8 March by immigration agents who refused to provide a warrant, he had previously said. He described his time in custody in Louisiana as “long days bearing witness to the quiet injustices underway against a great many people precluded from the protections of the law”.While being detained he missed the birth of his first child, whom he briefly met last month and was able to hold despite the government attempting to block a “contact visit”. Earlier this month, he described the pain of missing the birth of the baby, who is named Deen.“Instead of holding my wife’s hand in the delivery room, I was crouched on a detention center floor, whispering through a crackling phone line as she labored alone,” Khalil said. “I listened to her pain, trying to comfort her while 70 other men slept around me. When I heard my son’s first cries, I buried my face in my arms so no one would see me weep.”Explore more on these topicsMahmoud KhalilTrump administrationUS immigrationPalestinian territoriesGazaIsrael-Gaza warLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

It gives US soldiers access to Danish airbases in three Danish cities – Karup, Skrydstrup and Aalborg – and grants American soldiers and military police powers over Danish civilians at these locations and outside them.Alarm over defence agreement giving US ‘unhindered access’ to Danish airbasesRead moreIf US soldiers were to commit a crime in Denmark, they would be punished under the US, not Danish, legal system in the first instance. The US will also be able to carry out military activities in and from Denmark – including stationing personnel, storing military material and equipment, maintenance, training and exercise activities.Despite heightened tensions between the US and Denmark amid Donald Trump’s unprecedented push to acquire Greenland – a strategically vital part of the Danish kingdom – andreports US intelligence agencies were ordered to increase espionage in the territory, a broad majority of the Danish parliament (Folketinget) voted in support of adopting the agreement. A total of 94 MPs voted for the bill and 11 against.Just before the vote, the leader of the Unity List party, Pelle Dragsted, said the agreement was “harmful to the country”.“It is an agreement that means that we will have areas in Denmark that are under American jurisdiction. Where Danish authorities cannot exercise control. And where mistreatment of prisoners can occur,” he said. “It is a gigantic failure towards the Danish population.”The agreement was signed under the Biden administration in December 2023. Since Trump’s return to office, relations between Copenhagen and Washington DC have altered dramatically.Some politicians believe the new agreement could surrender Danish sovereignty and even be a violation of the Danish constitution. The Danish government has said this is not the case.The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said the situation between the two countries made it even more necessary to maintain close ties. “The problem is not too much involvement from the US inEurope. On the contrary, the risk is that the US will withdraw and move troops away or stop donations to Ukraine,” she said.At a consultation on Tuesday, the Danish justice minister, Peter Hummelgaard, said Danish authorities would have “primary safety responsibility both on and off the facilities covered by the agreement”.The Danish Institute for Human Rights has said the bill risks giving US soldiers the right to stop demonstrations outside their bases and would prevent Denmark from prosecuting them if they used excessive force.Peter Vedel Kessing, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for Human Rights,told the Guardianin May: “If the bill is passed and American soldiers carry out illegal acts in Denmark, it will be beyond Danish control and outside the reach of the Danish legal system to prosecute such actions.”Explore more on these topicsDenmarkEuropeDonald TrumpJoe BidennewsShareReuse this content"

If you want to know how much faith a studio has in a property, your best bet is to look out for licensed merchandise. This is why Wicked partnered with 400 corporate brands ahead of its release last year and why every shop on the high street is heaving with Lilo & Stitch merch. It’s why the last bag of Doritos you ate had Jack Black’s face on it.But this strategy isn’t failsafe. Yes, if you’re promoting a big four-quadrant blockbuster, it’s easy to team up with companies who’ll paste their products with adverts for your film. However, if your film is too small, or too sad, or too weird, then any sort of brand collaboration is going to seem an extremely odd fit. In other words, can I interest anyone in a pint of 28 Years Later beer?No, really. This week a press release announced that “independent craft beer mavericks” Tiny Rebel are “dialling up the chaos” by launching two new official 28 Years Later IPAs. One of them is a “blood orange liqueur-infused IPA with an infectiously juicy bite”, the other is a “tropical pineapple IPA that’s as bold as it is refreshing”, and both are “inspired by the ferocious energy and apocalyptic vibes of the new 28 Years Later film, bringing fans a taste experience as intense as the film itself”.View image in fullscreenI’ll have what he’s having … Ralph Fiennes in the film.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyWhich isn’t to say that the beers sound bad. Maybe they’re a bit try-hard, sure, and aimed slightly too aggressively at 40-year-old men who wear little tiny beanie hats, but each to their own. Nevertheless, I cannot legitimately think of a situation where I’d walk into a pub and deliberately seek out a beer with palpably apocalyptic vibes. There is no feasible way that – were I to point at a beer and ask the server “Is this intense?” and they reply “Yes, it is exactly as intense as that film where an emaciated zombie gets machine-gunned to death by a screaming soldier as it kills and eats his friend” – I would say “Ooh, that sounds nice. One of those please.”Again, this isn’t a knock against 28 Years Later. Based on everything we’ve seen so far it looks like exactly the sort of poundingly intense folk horror that we don’t make any more. It looks like a film (and this is a compliment) where you don’t want to walk home alone in the dark after the credits roll. I am extremely excited to see it.The problem is trying to marry this sense of oppressive dread to happy funtimes. And this has always been an issue with this particular series. Nine years ago, I was asked to go and watch 28 Days Later at a screening hosted by the immersive Secret Cinema group. And I hadsucha crap time. Had I been sent to go and see (for example) Grease, it would have been a different matter entirely. If I’d seen Grease, I’d have been surrounded by cool cars and gum-popping girls and spontaneous dance parties.View image in fullscreenYum! A serving suggestions for the new beers.Photograph: PRBut no.I went to see 28 Days Later, which meant that it was full of extras in military uniforms angrily yelling at everyone, and a siren that went off every five minutes requiring all the ticketholders to crouch down for an arbitrary amount of time for no specific reason, and really overpriced cheeseburgers. All of which is perfectly in keeping with the tone of the film, but as a mode of entertainment in itself it was excruciatingly bad.That’s the problem, really. 28 Days Later is a masterpiece – and the same might be said for the new sequel – but it isn’t one you necessarily want to live inside. You’re meant to survive it, not sip it. The fact that there’s a branded tie-in beer is probably just a reflection of the world we live in, but you could argue that the fact it exists in the first place only detracts from the film as a piece of art. So thanks but no thanks. If I wanted a pint that feels like the end of the world, there’s a Wetherspoons just down the road.Explore more on these topicsHorror filmsBeerDanny BoyleZombiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Be afraid – and excitedAlyssa MercanteWed 11 Jun 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 19.10 EDTShareA surprise announcement at the end of the 6 June Summer Game Fest presentation revealed the ninth entry in the iconic Capcom survival horror series:Resident EvilRequiem, coming early next year.Diehard fans of the series (which has spawned films, television shows and more) immediately began picking apart the trailer, which highlights protagonist Grace Ashcroft, the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft, featured in 2003’s Resident Evil Outbreak. Requiem appears to be set in Racoon City, the fictional location in the franchise that was famously nuked to try and stop the spread of the zombifying T-Virus.Game director Kōshi Nakanishi introduced the game at a demo in LA last week, saying that Requiem’s core theme is “addictive fear” and that Grace Ashcroft is a much more timid, fearful protagonist than the military-trained heroes of previous games.View image in fullscreenTop scarer … Resident Evil Requiem.Photograph: CapcomI heard reactions to the demo before I saw it (screams and shouts, mostly), and when it was my turn to enter a dark room with a few dozen other people, boy, did it freak me out. I think anyone would be fearful if they woke up hanging upside down from a gurney, with a needle in their arm regularly drawing blood into a massive glass container hanging nearby. That’s how this snippet ofResident Evil Requiemgameplay begins, and it’s hard not to wince in empathic pain as Grace tries to free herself from her restraints. She manages, however, and the game shifts from a cutscene into first-person play, offering a few options to examine items in the room, which looks like it’s in an abandoned hotel or hospital.As you’d expect, certain rooms have functioning electricity, but Grace is mainly in the dark, red emergency lights bathing everything in an eerie glow. She stumbles around, trying to find keys for locked doors and fuses to boot up breakers, all whilesomethingmoves about this spooky space with her. Just when it seems that Grace has the tools to escape whatever the hell this place is, she stumbles across a body. Before she can figure out whose it is, a disgusting, massive creature resembling the monster inBarbarianappears, with massive black eyes, huge ears, pointed teeth and hands that are far, far too large.The creature picks the body up and bites into its flesh, in a moment that feels like a one-to-one recreation of the famousGoya painting Saturn Devouring His Son.Goosebumps dance up my arms. We see this creature a few more times during the gameplay snippet, punctuated by screams from the players. At the very end, it seems like the demo starts over: the pause menu pops up, and the player navigates to a toggle between first- and third-person modes. The crowd “oohs” and “ahhs” – there hasn’t yet been aResigame that lets you swap between perspectives (except Village, which added that functionality as part of a paid-for update in 2021).The phrase “this is the overture to our darkest symphony yet” appears on-screen before the demo ends and we are ushered into a dark hallway to exit. “What the fuck?” someone mumbles behind me.

But this funny and smart French comedy instead gives us a 21st-century Jane Austen. British-French actor Camille Rutherford is terrific as Agathe, an aspiring novelist working in a Paris bookshop who wins a place on a Jane Austen writing retreat run by the author’s descendants.“I’m not living in the right century!” Agathe wails to her best friend and colleague Félix (Pablo Pauly). She’s not into dating apps (“I don’t want Uber sex!”). But she does have chemistry with Félix (he’s a player, but not at Wickham levels of caddishness), and it’s Félix who secretly submits Agathe’s writing to a Jane Austen society. The comedy takes a bit of an IQ dip when the film crosses the Channel and the dialogue switches to English. Still, it glides along on Rutherford’s performance as Agathe – witty, warm, keenly observant, a bit clumsy and Bridget Jones-ish, but never, not even for a moment, cringy.On the retreat, Agathe takes an instant loathing to Austen’s great-great-great-nephew Oliver (Charlie Anson); he’s a professor of modern literature who loftily proclaims that Austen is overrated. Judgmental, arrogant, and altogether up himself, Oliver is the film’s Mr Darcy – though played with too much Hugh Grant to take seriously. You don’t have to be an Austen fan to enjoy this film, but it helps. Agathe’s dilemma between Oliver and Félix is classic Austen – but Agathe’s real discovery is not love, but her writing voice. And that’s the point the film makes without trying too hard: new century, same self-pressure and doubt. Here’s Agathe on impostor syndrome. “No – I’m a genuine impostor!”Jane Austen Wrecked My Life is in UK cinemas from 13 June and Australian cinemas from 19 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsRomance filmsJane AustenComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

In this well-crafted horror movie, a young woman called Grace (Jena Malone) finds herself up against a bunch of nuns who may or may not be trying to do something extremely dodgy with an unknown relic, and as with last year’s Omen prequel, there’s a nice line in casting here from the Ladybird Book of Horror Nuns. There’s dotty young nun who pops up going “peekaboo” (Eilidh Fisher), an arrogant mother superior (Janet Suzman), a hardliner weapon-of-Christ sort (Jolade Obasola), and the rather rarer spooky nun with one eye hidden behind an ominous white bandage (Alexandra Lewis). Their acting is uniformly excellent, as is that fromDanny Huston, who plays a priest who introduces himself thusly: “I’m Father Romero, I’m here from the Vatican,” which announces him as probably up to no good from the get-go.Grace arrives to identify the body of her brother (Steffan Cennydd), seemingly involved in a murder-suicide, has reasons of her own for being less than a fully paid-up God squad member, and while the reasons may not be much of a surprise if you’ve seen a few of these kinds of films, this is a very nicely put together example. Sure, it’s purest hokum, but real pride has gone into crafting it..Cocooning the treats of the storytelling in natural splendour, Consecration boasts some gorgeous location work; filmed on Skye and other scenic areas, there are rolling highlands, vertiginous cliff-tops, a tumbledown abbey on the crest of a hill – which you just have to accept as the site of the Knights of the Morning Star, an ancient dark force in the church. The world of the film feels real, a splendid argument for less green screen, more green fields – kudos to veteran British horror helmer Christopher Smith (Severance).Consecration is on digital platforms from 16 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsDanny HustonreviewsShareReuse this content"

High Rollers is a heart-slowing work of staggering stupidity and charmlessness, ineptly made and quite frankly dull except when its flaws become so egregious you can’t help but guffaw.The idea is that Mason Goddard (John Travolta, who has finally given up on hairpieces and embraced the bald) leads a rodent pack of skilled thieves and conmen. The gang is first met at the beach wedding of two of the group’s younger members, tech whiz Link (Natali Yura, mouth permanently agape) and dim hunk Caras (Swen Temmel). Alas, the nuptials are interrupted when international criminal Salazar (Danny Pardo) and his henchmen swoop in and kidnap Mason’s wife Amelia (Gina Gershon, somehow surviving this with dignity intact). Salazar demands that Mason and his crew, which also includes his gormless safecracking brother Shawn (Lukas Haas) and sidekicks Anton (mononymed Quavo) and Hector (Noel Gugliemi), must steal the contents of a safe in the suite of casino owner Zade Black (Demián Castro) at his supposedly classy New Orleans casino the Scarlet Pearl.Even the name of this fictional gaming facility sounds trashy, and when we see its interior – all lurid carpeting and easily wipeable soft furnishings – it looks less like Monte Carlo’s finest than the kind of seedy regional gambling den that the producers could hire cheaply. The air of tawdry cost-cutting pervades every level of the film, from the casting to the costumes to the paste jewellery that’s supposed to stand in for posh gemstones. There are tons of holes in the plot, but those are too tedious to parse; just study the frame closely and you can have a laugh at the truly hideous pictures on the walls that someone on the team thought would pass for fancy art.High Rollers is on digital platforms from 16 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersJohn TravoltareviewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve always been the dealer’Thomas HobbsHe’s already put out seven albums this year – a work ethic inherited, he says, from selling drugs in Detroit. But will we ever hear his tracks with the late great J Dilla?Wed 11 Jun 2025 06.15 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 12.18 EDTShareIn the brief window between my conversation withDetroitrapper Boldy James and you reading this sentence, it is likely that the 42-year-old MC will have surprise-released at least one new album on to streaming platforms. This year alone, he has already released seven records. A planned eighth is due in July, but who knows what might pop up in between.“My father always told me you’ve gotta work twice as hard because you can’t expect something for nothing in this life!” Boldy says of a work rate that can easily result in 20 new songs being completed in the studio over a 24-hour period. His combative verses, as cutting and direct as Don Corleone whispering instructions to a made man, have earned him critical adoration and elicited high-profile co-signs from hip-hop figureheads including Earl Sweatshirt, Nas, Westside Gunn, the late Mac Miller and producer the Alchemist, while fans are intrigued to know how he remains so prolific.Boldy calls his release strategy “flooding the market” – tactics he learned from his days caught up selling drugs on Detroit’s West Side. “My homie worked the track – which was a long stretch filled with junkies – from 3am to 6am. He might make $5,000 [£3,700] per night. It might have taken my dad a few months to earn that same cash, so I ended up doing it too. I’ve never been no sleepyhead. I used to sell drugs all night and then go to my class to take an exam. No problem.”Boldy describes his days selling narcotics on cold street corners with vivid cinematic flair: on the spooky new trap song Aspen, he jokes that his “Mexican plug” – slang for a prestigious international drugs source – looks a lot like the late civil rights activist Cesar Chavez. Is that true? Boldy laughs: “Allegedly.” He looks back on this part of his life as a reflection of his resourcefulness. “I never just settled for the cards life was dealing me,” he says. “I’ve always been more like the dealer.”A student of 1990s mafioso rap, a teenage Boldy fed off the confidence of artists such as the Notorious BIG and Erick Sermon. “I like it when men have firm handshakes and don’t whine too much,” he says. He started releasing music independently in the late 2000s, a sound built around warm nostalgia and sleepy depression. Boldy can be famously sedate in interviews, but today he’s lively and open.He usually works with a single producer per record, giving his albums an unusual cohesiveness in a collaboration-heavy genre. Produced by Detroit “sound healer” Sterling Toles, the soul stirring spiritual jazz sermon of Mommy Dearest (A Eulogy), one of Boldy’s most experimental songs, reflects on a childhood of serious neglect due to a mother lost to addiction. “Tellin’ me that you was on your way to come see me / And left me sittin’ on the porch in the rain, freezing,” he raps amid stuttery saxophone that can’t decide if it wants to soar or whimper.But when we talk, Boldy doesn’t want to reflect too much on that difficult past. It’s all in his music. He says his 2022 song Power Nap is among the finest examples of his lyricism. “We went from childhood dreams to federal nightmares” … “Six sleeper bags on the grass it’s a slumber party,” he raps, his vocals evoking those of Mobb Deep’s Prodigy as he burrows into unorthodox pockets of drumless soul-rap.“On one level, six sleeping bags makes you reminisce on your childhood and having those sleepovers to play Nintendo with all your friends, right?” he asks. “But it’s also because I could easily roll up the street and see six young Black males on the grass, laid out dead. I represent the hood struggle for real. No gimmicks.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve got a lot to lose’ … Boldy James.Photograph: Double Dee (@gametime_doubledee)Today, he cares most about showing his six children “the whole world,” he says. “I want to make sure I’m always sharing wisdom, because you can get took out at any moment. Right now I’m jumping out half a million dollar cars, wearing $400,000 [£300,000] worth of jewels. It means I’ve got a lot to lose.”‘Helping people survive’: how creating a hip-hop album supported incarcerated artistsRead moreTestament to Boldy’s stature is the fact that he’s sitting on an unreleased collaborative album with J Dilla rumoured to be called Drug Dilla. Boldy has previously said that the late Detroit beatmaker’s estate had given him access to some of the last beats the producer ever crafted – putting him among the small group of MCs (Busta Rhymes, Ghostface Killah, MF Doom, Phat Kat) to get posthumous approval from his camp.Boldy has said the album is finished, but I’m warned in advance not to ask about a release date. Yet he offers a telling answer on why his flow might fit so well over Dilla’s unconventional production. “I rap for real niggas who don’t care about club music. That’s more my lane. I got like a left-handed type of flow anyways, so not a lot of people can really bounce or groove to my shit. There’s a time and a place for my music.”Asked what that is, Boldy concludes: “It’s music made for people trying to process their past and turn it into a net positive. Play it on a road trip while driving to visit family. But I don’t expect everybody to relate either … because not everybody grew up around money and murder.”Boldy James and Nicholas Craven’s new single, Spider Webbing Windshields, is out now.

For 34 days, they took turns sitting on it. When the egg hatched, the story became a viral sensation. The New York Times celebrated “A Love That Dare Not Squeak Its Name”. Roy, Silo and their daughter Tango became the subject of a LGBTQ-friendly children’s book, And Tango Makes Threeby Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell.Biology professor Nathan Lents remembers receiving copies of Tangoas a gift when he and his husband became foster parents. Fast-forward to the present day, and Tango tops Pen America’s list of the most frequently banned picture books in the US. It was part of a high-profile lawsuit in Nassau County, Florida, and was designated for pulping by officials in Singapore. In 2025, it’s apparent that “conventional categories for gender identity and expression, and sexual attraction and romanticism, are just not cutting it any more”, Lents writes. Queer, non-binary, transgender, polyamorous – terms that were perhaps once obscure are here to stay. But at the same time, a powerful backlash is under way.This bookisn’t a directly political text, but its colourful tales from the animal world do have a point of view: biology, Lents argues here, comes down strongly against rigid categories. The story of sexual evolutionis one of experimentation and constant improvisation, and that, he says, goes a long way to explaining why human sexual norms seem to be undergoing a transformation: “I assert that this moment of sexual turmoil is actually a rediscovery of the much more expansive relationship with sex that our ancestors once had and that other animals enjoy,” he writes.Humans have an unhelpful tendency to project their own biases on to their observationsWhat follows is an entertaining and informative romp through mating strategies in nature. From Komodo dragons’ virgin births to the bilateral sperm transfer of hermaphroditic slugs, The Sexual Evolution chronicles a “wondrous variety” of behaviour in the animal world. Garter snake orgies, gender-masking hyenas, lusty bonobos and the lesbian Laysan albatrosses of Hawaii – this book has it all.All that diversity is fascinating, and frequently funny. Take the family structures of clown fish like the ones in Pixar’s 2003 hit Finding Nemo. The film tells the touching story of a dad fish’s quest to be reunited with his son after the mum is eaten,but “if the movie were biologically accurate, the story would have proceeded a little differently”, says Lents. “Upon the loss of his mate, Marlin would have transitioned to female. By the time Marlin reunited with Nemo, she would have been his mother.” And then? Once Marlin and Nemo established a new home, they would have begun to breed – together.While same-sex penguin unions might be sweet, clearly things tend to work a little bit differently in the non-human world than they do in our own. Animals can’t tell us why they mate or pair or behave the way they do. And humans have an unhelpful tendency to project their own biases on to their observations – something that is evident in the long history of sexism in biological sciences. “As the mostly male scientists through the last two centuries looked around at the animal world, they were all too eager to find validation for male dominance in human society,” Lents notes. For this reason, The Sexual Evolution is careful to avoid making simplistic comparisons, especially when it comes to the sex lives of other primates, such as chimps and bonobos.Unfortunately, the book’s final chapters, which turn to our own relationships, are its least compelling. Can we really draw any conclusions about human sexuality from our piecemeal knowledge of sexual norms in hunter-gatherer societies? Or from the swinging seductions of highly successful Soviet spies? Not all stories make useful parables. The Sexual Evolution is at its strongest when it’s simply revelling in kaleidoscopic tales of how other species do it. As Lents points out: “The natural world is a constantly churning diversity-generating machine, and the natural history of sex reflects that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The other answer is that there are very good reasons not. I mean, leave it alone – why interfere with people’s imaginations about what happens to the characters? Also, and this is not true for Hilary Mantel or The Godfather, but in general sequels tend to be pale.”Not this one. While Tóibín’s palette may be rather lighter on vermilion than Puzo’s – or indeed Mantel’s – Long Island is anything but pale. As for the characters, it is pure pleasure to be back in their absorbingly complex company.Twenty years have passed since Eilis sailed for America for the second time, leaving local Enniscorthy barman Jim Farrell to return to Brooklyn and Tony Fiorello, the plumber to whom she was already secretly married. Since then she has not once gone back to Ireland. She and Tony live with their two teenage children on Long Island, in a suburban cul-de-sac built for the family by the Fiorello brothers. It is a stiflingly close-knit arrangement.That peace is smashed to pieces in the opening pages of Long Island when a stranger, an Irish customer of Tony’s, turns up on her doorstep. Tony’s plumbing, he informs her, has proved “too good”. His wife is expecting Tony’s baby. Since the Irishman has no intention of raising a “plumber’s brat”, when the child is born, he will leave it on their doorstep. As the baby’s birth approaches and the question of its future remains unresolved, she seizes on her mother’s 80th birthday as a pretext to return to Ireland for the summer with her children.After its explosive opening, Long Island unfolds in a series of small events: a shopping trip to Dublin, a walk on a beach, a wedding. This deceptively quiet novel is the work of a writer at the height of his considerable powers, a story of ordinary lives that contains multitudes. In general, it is true, sequels are pale things, but the exceptions to the rule are glorious, contriving both to satisfy on their own terms and to deepen the reader’s relationship with the book that came before. Long Island can safely count itself among their number.Clare Clark£8.49 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionWhen Olive Kitteridge met Lucy BartonTell Me EverythingElizabeth StroutTell Me EverythingElizabeth StroutWhen Olive Kitteridge met Lucy BartonEver since Elizabeth Strout’s first novel, Amy and Isabelle (1998), introduced us to the imaginary New England town of Shirley Falls, she has developed a grippingly cohesive fictional landscape that gets richer with every book. The lives of ordinary people in ordinary places are Strout’s speciality. Her debut featured an emotionally wounded single mother and her equally wounded daughter, while in Olive Kitteridge (2008) and Olive, Again (2019) we became acquainted with the cantankerous schoolteacher Olive and her longsuffering husband Henry in nearby Crosby. The Burgess Boys (2013) returned to Shirley Falls with the story of legal aid attorney Bob, his more successful corporate lawyer brother Jim, and their fraught relationship. My Name Is Lucy Barton (2016), meanwhile, launched the parallel account, presented as a memoir, of the New-York based writer Lucy, a survivor, barely, of an impoverished and abusive post-second world war childhood in Illinois. The Barton family history was explored from different angles in a volume of linked stories, Anything Is Possible (2017), and in the Booker-shortlisted novel Oh William! (2021), where we learned more about Lucy’s failed first marriage to the microbiologist William Gerhardt.These worlds finally converged in Lucy By the Sea (2022), a pandemic novel that brought Lucy’s memoir-writing up to date in real time. The outbreak of Covid saw Lucy and her ex-husband, William, renting a house together in Crosby in order to escape locked-down New York. In Tell Me Everything they are now permanently settled there and are on the point of remarrying. The central pillar in this configuration is Bob Burgess, who happens to be William’s solicitor and who was responsible for introducing him and Lucy to the community. We are told at the outset that this is Bob’s story – the story of an apparently unexceptional 65-year-old man, who “would never believe he had anything worthy in his life to document. But he does; we all do.”“Tell me everything” is a credo of sorts, a statement of the writer’s voracious need to know, to solve the human case. But that Strout’s oblique approach to matters of the heart works so well is partly due to her judicious use of silence and omission to suggest the complexity of our closest connections. After Bob tries to act as the middleman in repairing Jim’s relationship with his son, Larry writes Jim a letter: “He unfolded the letter that was inside the envelope, and Bob put on his glasses and read ‘Dear Dad,’ and then the page was empty except for at the bottom where it was signed, ‘Love, Larry.’”Sometimes, in this taciturn but deeply felt and profoundly intelligent novel, a kindly blank page is as good as it gets. Tell me everything. Or tell me nothing.Elizabeth Lowry£8.49 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirLast testamentPatriotAlexei NavalnyPatriotAlexei NavalnyLast testamentAlexei Navalny was watching his favourite cartoon show, Rick and Morty, when he suddenly felt unwell. He was 21 minutes into an episode where Rick turns into a pickle. The late Russian opposition leader was on a flight back to Moscow after campaigning ahead of regional elections in the Siberian city of Tomsk in August 2020. Something was clearly wrong, and Navalny staggered to the bathroom.He is clear who gave the order to kill him with the nerve agent novichok: Vladimir Putin. Navalny spent 18 days in a coma, waking up in hospital in Germany. It was while recovering in Freiburg that he wrote the first part of his extraordinary memoir, Patriot. The second section consists of letters from prison, following his January 2021 return to Moscow, when he was dramatically arrested at the airport. Navalny says he embarked on an autobiography knowing the Kremlin could finish him off. “If they do finally whack me, this book will be my memorial,” he notes.During one of Yulia’s visits, Navalny told her there was a “high probability” he would never get out of prison alive. “They will poison me,” he said. “I know,” she replied. He sketches out what this means – no chance to say goodbye, never meeting his grandchildren, “tasseled mortar boards tossed in the air in my absence”. Maybe an unmarked grave. His philosophy: hope for the best, expect the worst. His death is a terrible loss, for Russia and for all of us.Luke Harding£9.34 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseHealthA remarkable account of an organ transplantThe Story of a HeartRachel ClarkeThe Story of a HeartRachel ClarkeA remarkable account of an organ transplantIn 2017, a nine-year-old girl from Devon was involved in a car crash that left her with a catastrophic brain injury. Keira had been a keen horse rider who loved animals, and would go out of her way to rescue insects in distress. After her family were told she was brain dead they immediately asked if she would be able to donate her organs, knowing it was what she would have wanted.As Keira lay in intensive care, a young boy from Cheshire was on his eighth month in hospital with a dangerously enlarged heart. Before he became ill, nine-year-old Max loved to play football, climb trees and wrestle with his friends. But now, with acute cardiomyopathy brought on by a viral infection, Max was painfully thin and being kept alive with a mechanical heart pump. Not only did he not have the strength to leave his bed but, on his darkest days, he didn’t want to live. He and his family knew his heart could give out at any minute and his only hope was a transplant.In the Women’s prize for nonfiction shortlisted The Story of a Heart, Dr Rachel Clarke writes about the feat of modern medicine that allowed Keira to give life to Max by donating her heart. There are moments, within this intricate tapestry, where her evocative, empathetic writing makes you catch your breath. In one of the most remarkable passages, we find ourselves privy to the meeting of the two families – a rarity in transplant cases – three months after Max’s surgery. Joe, Keira’s father, is handed a stethoscope. Putting the buds in his ears, he lays the drum on Max’s chest and listens to his daughter’s heart: busy, pulsing, alive.Fiona Sturges£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionArt monstersBlue RuinHari KunzruBlue RuinHari KunzruArt monstersBlue Ruin opens with the protagonist, Jay, delivering groceries to a palatial home in a rich enclave of upstate New York. On the doorstep his customer stands masked; this is happening in the early days of the Covid lockdown. Thus it takes him a moment to recognise Alice, his girlfriend from another life.Twenty years before, Jay and Alice lived together in London. He was then an up-and-coming Young British Artist, and she an aspiring curator. They had one of those relationships that made people run their names together: Jayanalice, Aliceanjay. Now she is “radiant with the kind of health that’s made of yoga and raw juices and massage and money”. She’s also married to Rob, Jay’s erstwhile best friend and rival, for whom she left him without a word. Jay, meanwhile, is prematurely aged from poverty and the punishing jobs that go with it. He’s sick with long Covid and filthy from weeks of living in his car. “See me, Alice,” he thinks. “Nothing but a ragged membrane. A dirty scrap of ectoplasm, separating nothing from nothing.” She does see him; she calls out his name. A moment later he collapses, struggling to draw a breath.Alice takes Jay in, hiding him in a barn to conceal him from Rob and the other two members of her lockdown pod. In Jay’s long, fevered days of convalescence, he is haunted by memories of their past.Blue Ruin is bracingly intelligent and often just plain beautiful. It’s a reminder that fiction, at its best, is a place to encounter new experiences and dwell in big ideas. Kunzru is known for ambitious novels that bring politics to rich, imaginative life; Blue Ruin shows him at the top of his game.Sandra Newman£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionBravura small-town chorusHeart, Be at PeaceDonal RyanHeart, Be at PeaceDonal RyanBravura small-town chorusDonal Ryan made a stir straight out of the gate. His first novel, The Spinning Heart, published a dozen years ago, won the Guardian first book award and was longlisted for the Booker prize. A work of choral elegance, it is told in a sequence of 21 voices, inhabitants of a community in County Tipperary, Ireland – where Ryan himself is from – and unspooled the long and bitter wake of the 2008 financial crash in Ireland.Since then, Ryan has published five more novels and a book of short stories. He is a writer who likes a conceit: a chronological structure to contain the narrative; multiple voices. It is a measure of his skill, and gift for both language and character, that these techniques don’t seem like contrivances, but rather widen the reader’s sense of what a story can be.And so it is with this sequel to his debut, Heart, Be at Peace. Once again, he gives us a sequence of 21 voices; readers of the first book will be reunited with many of the folk they came to know – but never fear, this works just as well as a standalone. Ryan is always deeply engaged by the way the fortunes of 21st-century Ireland impact directly on his characters: the financial emergency that afflicted this small town may have faded, but new troubles – opportunities, to some – have arisen to take their place. Ryan deftly interweaves a larger sense of danger, and an understanding of Ireland’s history, with domestic concerns.Erica Wagner£8.49 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionThe political is personalThe Spoiled HeartSunjeev SahotaThe Spoiled HeartSunjeev SahotaThe political is personalOn the release of his third novel, 2021’s Booker-longlisted China Room, Sunjeev Sahota noted with some frustration the limiting lens through which his work tends to be viewed. “Everyone always comments on the fact that my novels all have brown protagonists,” he remarked, “but what no one ever says is that there aren’t actually any characters in my novels who aren’t working class.”As is to be expected from a novelist whose work has addressed religious radicalisation, migration and intergenerational trauma, Sahota was probing challenging territory. He was also, it now becomes clear, laying the groundwork for his fourth novel, which leans decisively into exactly this ideological tension.At the centre of The Spoiled Heart is Nayan Olak. From a factory job in the small Derbyshire town of Chesterfield, Nayan has worked his way up to the point where he is running to be union leader. Espousing a politics firmly rooted in class analysis, he emphasises tan­gible material improvements: safer working conditions, fairer contracts, better pensions. Well known and well liked, he polls strongly, and seemingly can’t lose.While Nayan benefits from the relative privilege that attends a middle-aged man who is largely affirming the status quo, Megha, his determined young opponent for the position, has to work far harder to be heard.For a narrator, Sahota casts a Zuckerman-like alter ego: Sajjan, a writer from the same town who reconnects with a bruised Nayan and pieces together his unravelling. This additional layer of perspective provides both layered ambiguity and a broadened scope, allowing the novel to take in other lives and viewpoints: Helen, towards whom Nayan is increasingly attracted, and her son Brandon, who is rebuilding his life after a viral public shaming. As Sajjan probes, he gives shape not only to the collapse of Nayan’s seemingly assured election campaign, but to the weight of grief that precedes and in some ways informs it: the death, in an unexplained fire, of Nayan’s mother and infant son.What lifts this tightly patterned novel from the weight of its own mechanics is Sahota’s remarkable skill in characterisation. Every person, however narratively significant, feels intimately alive, partly because Sahota is so clever in his shifts of perspective. His characters don’t just appear, they emerge and grow, revealing of themselves a little more in every finely judged interaction.Sam Byers£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseHistoryUnderstanding women's bodiesImmaculate FormsHelen KingImmaculate FormsHelen KingUnderstanding women's bodiesIn this study, the historian of medicine, Helen King, tells the story of women’s bodies using four body parts: breasts, clitoris, hymen and womb. Chosen for their importance to debates on gender identity, sexuality and reproductive health, she shows how the understanding of these parts has changed over time, sometimes being used “to demonstrate that women are basically the same as men, at others to claim that they are entirely different”.For example, the ancient Greeks thought female bodies and minds were “biologically unstable”, because menstrual blood accumulated inside them and made the womb move, pressing on their organs. For this reason, they were excluded from much of the life of the Greek city-state. Throughout history such body-based beliefs – usually conceived by men – have been used to tell women “what our bodies can and can’t do”.As well as medical knowledge, King draws on mythical and religious ideas about women’s bodies, especially regarding sexuality and pregnancy. Generally she finds that “men come as the human default setting; women as the ones who need to be explained”. Breasts are “the place where embodiment as female is most expressed and most deeply felt”, probably because they are the most visible parts and are both maternal and sexual. The hymen has been used to promote “ideals of purity as physical closure”, as well as signifying, through its loss, the passage to womanhood. The clitoris – whose existence, like the hymen, has been disputed – is “solely for joy”. Supposedly discovered in the 16th century at the end of the Age of Discovery by a man, King notes ironically: “America, and the clitoris, were already there”. The purpose of the womb is just reproduction and she comments that “being impossible to see has made it a breeding ground not only for us, but for myths about its nature and function”, a uniquely powerful and mysterious organ in medicine, religion, as well as art and literature.This is an immensely impressive work of scholarship, the result of a lifetime of thought and research on the subject and its implications for women today. Authoritative and wide-ranging, it is a remarkably rich scientific and cultural survey. King notes that history offers women many explanations of these four body parts and how they explain “who we are”.  But she concludes: “whether or not we agree that our bodies are our ‘selves’, they are our bodies, and knowing their past is the key to understanding our present.”PD Smith£10.79 (RRP £11.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseHistoryWhen India ruled the worldThe Golden RoadWilliam DalrympleThe Golden RoadWilliam DalrympleWhen India ruled the worldForget the Silk Road, argues William Dalrymple in his dazzling new book. What came first, many centuries before that, was India’s Golden Road, which stretched from the Roman empire in the west all the way to Korea and Japan in the far east. For more than a millennium, from about 250BC to AD1200, Indian goods, aesthetics and ideas dominated a vast “Indosphere”. Indian merchants, travelling huge distances on the monsoon winds, reaped vast profits from its matchless cloth, spices, oils, jewellery, ivory, hardwoods, glass and furniture.The Golden Road deftly charts these economic developments. But Dalrymple’s larger theme is India’s intellectual hegemony. As he shows, during this era India was the great religious and philosophical superpower of Eurasia, with lasting effects into the present.Dalrymple is a born storyteller, with a wonderful facility for expounding complex events with verve and clarity. Like any successful synthesis, his text draws on vast reading as well as a keen eye for telling details. Yet it’s also a deeply personal work. Before writing a string of acclaimed books about British imperial adventures in south Asia, he was already renowned as a chronicler of its esoteric religious traditions. The Golden Road, teeming with his own evocative descriptions of far-flung cave and forest temples, sculptures and wall paintings, is not just a historical study but also a love letter – to a lost syncretic world of interacting and evolving religious creeds and intellectual movements, when Indian ideas transformed the world.Fara Dabhoiwala£11.69 (RRP £12.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionDark family secretsThe UnwildingMarina KempThe UnwildingMarina KempDark family secretsA sultry August in Sicily in 1999 provides the initial setting for Marina Kemp’s powerfully compelling second novel. The court of the revered novelist and patriarch Don Travers – his four children; his silent, apparently surrendered wife Lydia; and a revolving guestlist of the great and good, the influential, the useful and the up-and-coming – is in situ at Il Frantoio, the rambling villa the family takes every summer.To whom does the truth of lived experience belong, Kemp asks. If the same family secret inspires rage in one victim and shame in another, whose is the copyright? The tension Kemp applies to this tightrope is the key to her success in walking it. Holding all her narratives in balance and leaving final judgment to the reader, she is meticulous and unsparing in her dissection of the creative process and its casualties. And our reward is the miraculous potency of the written word, the tale shaped and told through Lydia – who barely speaks even to those she held closest, but does finally set her story down in writing – and through Kemp’s own masterly skill.Christobel Kent£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionGhosts of the pastThe EchoesEvie WyldThe EchoesEvie WyldGhosts of the pastMax, a thirtysomething creative writing tutor, has died, and now haunts the second-floor flat in London’s Tulse Hill where he once lived with his Australian girlfriend, Hannah. This is inconvenient, as Max doesn’t believe in ghosts, and yet here he is, watching Hannah grieve, “floating about like a jellyfish, my tendrils … sweeping up the lint and hair from the floor. Sometimes when I come forth I take up the whole of a room, like a balloon slotted between ribs and blown up to make a space for breath.” Notice that funny, mysterious “come forth”, and the near-violence of the simile that follows (“slotted between ribs”): this is not going to be a quirky-sad love story, all poignant memories and hard-won insights. We are in Evie Wyld’s precise and unforgiving hands, and she knows exactly where she wants to take us.The narrative jumps largely between Max’s sections as a ghost trapped in the flat, titled “After”; Hannah’s chapters, set in the run-up to Max’s death, called “Before”; and “Then” – flashbacks to Hannah’s childhood in rural Australia. She grew up with her parents, her Uncle Tone and older sister Rachel on The Echoes, land on which a residential school for Indigenous and mixed-race children once stood. An old paddock concealed their small bones: victims of racist child removal policies that, until as recently as 1969, saw tens of thousands of kids taken from their families and either fostered with white families or sent to orphanages, missions or “training homes”. Few records were kept, but it’s known that many children died of neglect or from physical punishment, and their remains were secretly buried on site.Yet as well as terror The Echoes is also suffused with love, from the deep bond between Hannah and Rachel to the consoling and celebratory love of female friends, and the imperfect, wavering but ultimately lasting love between Hannah and Max. It is also – and this is important – a deeply funny book: there’s Max, who “has recently decided that the thing about him is fermentation”, burping a jar of homemade kimchi; Hannah’s brief liaison with a godawful friend, the whole thing watched by Max’s ghost, who is tersely surprised to observe that the friend is circumcised; Hannah’s chaotic pal Janey and her brilliantly serious daughter, who has a habit of upending adult conversations; a scabrously excruciating comic set piece of a Christmas dinner; and Max’s ghostly war, and eventual entente, with the cat Hannah gets after his death.Melissa Harrison£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseSocietyA divided world returnsGoodbye GlobalizationElizabeth BrawGoodbye GlobalizationElizabeth BrawA divided world returnsAfter the Cold War, globalisation was hailed by politicians and business leaders as the way to create higher living standards, reduce the threat of war and spread Western-style liberal democracy through free trade. According to security expert Elizabeth Braw, “it was an exhilarating time, with limitless opportunities for companies, cheaper products for consumers and better relations between countries”. In 2008, the Beijing Olympics neatly captured this ideal of a harmonious global community in its motto “One World, One Dream”.But by 2023, when Braw was writing this illuminating book, the war in Ukraine had led to the West severing economic and political links to Russia and an increasingly frosty relationship with China. Indeed, President Xi Jinping – though often praising globalisation – has not hesitated to use his country’s new-found economic power to intimidate states, such as Lithuania and Australia, as well as companies, including H&M and Nike: “executives lived in fear of punishment by the country that had seemed capitalism’s most adept pupil”. The dream of Western politicians – that if countries like Russia and China embraced a market economy they would also introduce democracy – has turned into a nightmare. Instead they have become more aggressive and authoritarian.Braw explores the rise of globalisation from the late 1980s up to the present, arguing that, despite an initial period of turbulence, its demise may even offer countries the opportunity to come up with a new way of coexisting and the chance to forge “a better world”. Through revealing interviews with key business leaders, politicians, bankers and ordinary citizens, she charts the optimism of the early years of globalisation (the “economics-is-everything” mindset), to the current realism of “the new friendshored world”, which could see manufacturing jobs returning to places like the Midlands in the UK, where former Labour MP John Spellar tells Braw: “we need to start training people in anticipation of the kinds of jobs that may arrive”.This is a timely study that offers many fascinating insights into the ideas and people behind globalisation. What could so easily have been a dry, scholarly text, is instead a pacy and very human story, weaving economics, technology and history into a compelling geopolitical narrative of the last three decades.PD Smith£12.99 - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClose"

Her new life is disturbed when she finds her ex-partner Tom has moved in down the road. Or rather, that’s one thread in a story that becomes steadily more interesting than this simple set-up from the romance novelist’s playbook, as layers of family memory and trauma build up to form a portrait of the wider O’Connor family: all their history, the way it has shaped them and the traces it has left on the places around.Claire shows herself to be unusually attuned to the history of her home place, telling stories about nearby Thoor Ballylee, where Yeats lived; Lady Gregory’s Coole Park; the place where Cromwell used to stable his horses. At first it seems a bit forced, a writer shoehorning in their research. But the tic begins to make sense as the marks of the past on Claire’s family are revealed; slowly, one realises that the enumeration of these histories is crucial to the way the O’Connors live. Central to this gradual discovery is Feeney’s use of stories-within-the-story; the novel is enlivened by a series of smaller, contained memories from Claire’s childhood, and tales reaching back a century to the time when the O’Connors first lived in the family home.The family believe they can never pull their old house down – but this cavern of memory only offers access to past painThese are fascinating interludes breaking up the main plot, which is the slow and not very complex thawing of Claire’s relationship with Tom, a recovery that seems to allow her to complete her cycle of grieving for her parents. In these shorter stories, which are like currants in the cake, we get access to the depths of her family’s life: heartbreaking glimpses of her father’s attempt to sell a horse to the queen of England’s breeders, and of the appalling violence visited on the family by the Black and Tans. These are the kinds of memories that can go on to define whole lives, and illuminate the more humdrum present Claire is living in.It slowly emerges that really, this novel tells the story of a house. Feeney has created a brilliant metaphor in the O’Connor family home, a modern bungalow with the old farmhouse looming behind it. Like the fairy tree at the bottom of the farm, the family have come to believe they can never pull the old house down, lest it bring them bad luck; but this looming cavern of memory seems to offer very little access to past happiness, only past pain. By the end of Let Me Go Mad in My Own Way, the novel has become a story about what a family should do with its past. It’s a hugely satisfying, sophisticated structure, and the apparent thinness of Claire and Tom’s story ceases to matter, because it’s only the first layer of a more complex work.Aspects of the novel are less successful. Claire finds herself drawn into the world oftradwives, and begins taking lifestyle tips from an Instagram account run by one of these women. This dalliance with what are essentially hard-right politics isn’t particularly well ironised, and Claire seems to simply snap out of it. She realises there is no lost perfect time, only different hardship; but the discovery isn’t given enough room to make sense, so all the pages of baking end up seeming like a fever dream that’s never quite explained. Feeney is also capable of writing very, very unsuccessful dialogue: “You’re not dragging me into your murky confusion, Claire.” “I forget sometimes.” “Forget what?” “All the people I’ve met – since.” “Since?” ‘Us.” This can make the characters sound a bit thick, which they manifestly aren’t. However, the novel’s baggy, complex, unfolding structure offers rich rewards.Let Me Go Mad in My Own Way by Elaine Feeney is published by Harvill Secker (£16.99).

Sign up hereAlyssa Mercante andKeza MacDonaldWed 11 Jun 2025 07.15 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 07.54 EDTShareAs protests exploded in Los Angeleslast weekend, elsewhere in the city, a coterie of games journalists and developers were gathered together to play new games at the industry’s annual summer showcase. This week’sissue is a dispatch from our correspondent Alyssa Mercante.Summer Game Fest (SGF), the annual Los Angeles-based gaming festival/marketing marathon, was set up to compete with the once-massive E3. It’s taken a few years, but now it has replaced it. 2025’s event felt like a cogent reminder that the games industry has dramatically changed since the pandemic. Whereas E3 used to commandeer the city’s convention centre smack in the middle of downtown LA, SGF is off the beaten path, nestled among the reams of fabric in the Fashion District, adjacent to Skid Row. There are fewer game companies present, it’s not open to the public and there’s no cosplay, unless it’s for marketing purposes.Its centrepiece is a live show held at the YouTube theatre near the airport, hosted by ever-present games industry hype-man Geoff Keighley and streamed to millions – and you can buy tickets for that. Some video game enthusiasts and smaller content creators told me that the in-person showcase wasn’t worth their money: just a very lengthy show that they could have watched online, culminating in a massive traffic jam to get out of Inglewood.This year’s event had some hiccups, including an attempted gatecrasher, but felt the most put-together yet. Attending SGF is a privilege, but it is also an ungodly hybrid of a marathon and a sprint: back-to-back-to-back appointments with publishers and developers with no downtime in-between, speed walking between cabanas and moving swiftly in and out of over air-conditioned rooms to ensure you don’t upset a PR person or accidentally spurn an indie developer. During brief breaks, if you even get one, you’ll shovel a canape into your gullet, wash it down with a Red Bull, have a quick bite of some (surprisingly good) PC Gamer-branded ice-cream, and attempt to get a few of your thoughts down on paper.Find your zen ... Urban Jungle.Illustration: Kylyk Games/Assemble EntertainmentI saw a lot of games this weekend, some of which I can’t talk about, but once again it was the indie games that were the most memorable. Not just because they’re unexpected or unique or silly, but because there are usually far fewer restrictions while you play, devs are more open to questions and there aren’t eight PR people standing over your shoulder to ensure you don’t open up an unfinished menu or wander some place you shouldn’t.On night one, I stuck my head in at the Media Indie Exchange (MIX) party downtown, and was immediately enraptured withUrban Jungle, a plant based game that speaks to my newfound love of horticulture. Placing plants around a cutesy little room afforded me a brief moment of zen in a crowded space full of people trying out dozens of indie games.Then there’sPetal Runner, a pixel art RPG that looks and feels like a Game Boy-era Pokémon title. Published by iam8bit and developed by two people who met in the Instagram comments under some cyberpunk artwork, it’s a beautiful, adorable, “no violence” RPG. Rather than engage in the questionable practice of capturing cute creatures and forcing them to fight each other, you simply help deliver them to their new owners and “calibrate” or calm them down through a series of old-school minigames. Then you hop on your motorcycle (Petal Runner’s programmer was inspired to get a bike after watching Tron: Legacy) to deliver another pet. After just 15 minutes, its modern chip-tune soundtrack, cool-toned palette, and cute creatures had me sold.ThickAs Thieves, meanwhile, is a multiplayer stealth game. A representative for the developer told me that the team wanted to make a multiplayer game that avoided the three “black holes”, or oversaturated genres: shooters, PvP combat, and pure action gameplay. The result is something that feels like Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood mixed with Dishonored: you’ll sneak through maps set in a dark early 1900s world cut through with slices of rich colour, while you try to pull off difficult heists to impress a thieves’ guild. But other players are trying to do the exact same thing, and guards and civilians will get in your way.View image in fullscreenSlay your dragons … Monster Hunter Now.Photograph: NianticI also got a chance to try out the new season ofMonster Hunter Nowfrom Niantic, the studio behind Pokémon Go. This augmented reality game drops you into a version of the real world filled with monsters from Capcom’s iconic action game, condensing the series’ epic fights into bite-size battles that are barely a minute long (they can be close to an hour in the mainline games). And I played the new, four-person party gameLego Partywith two other journalists, screaming as our Lego characters fell over each other during minigames or stole gold bricks in an attempt to get to first place. It was fun and freeing; people gathered around us as we yelled and guffawed and talked smack with gusto, as if we needed this game to help cleanse our tired palates.Every game I spent even a few minutes with this weekend was imbued with passion and creativity, no matter the size of the team or the scope of the project. It was a testament to the drive that fuels so many in this space, and the technological advancements that let smaller teams (sometimes just one or two people) make beautifully complex games. Seeing tons of fellow journalists and developers bright-eyed and excited, even with so many of us struggling to find work, recently laid off, or otherwise worried about the future, was a shot of adrenaline.But it was also impossible to ignore that something larger was taking place in LA, acting as a sombre backdrop to this comparatively low-stakes weekend of video games. On Saturday, protests broke out in Los Angeles, with citizens pushing back against the militant and cruel anti-immigration raids taking place across the city. The constant whir of helicopters was a bizarre soundtrack to the weekend; many people who had come from out of state or even out of the country were noticeably concerned about the escalating events. We furtively shared updates with each other at hands-on appointments, whispering about the national guard, warning each other to travel together and safely. On Sunday night, dozens of journalists and devs were told they couldn’t leave a downtown LA bar where they had gathered; the LAPD had shut down the area, determined to quell the protests.On the last day of SGF, we chatted about how weird it was to preview video games during such an acute political moment. One person told me they were playing a demo that kicked off with tanks and military men and, as he played, he heard the sounds of a helicopter circling overhead, and wondered where the game ended and the real world began.Alyssa MercanteWhat to playView image in fullscreenTense sci-fi … The Alters.Photograph: 11 Bit StudiosFrom the makers of Frostpunk and This War of Mine,The Altersis a strangesci-fi strategyexperiment that sees stranded space-worker Jan cloning himself several times over in order to assemble a team big enough to make it off an exoplanet before the sun rises and burns everything to cinders.

Yet he also gets edited and reinvented in a way that left me largely cold.Burra was modern but reactionary, a brilliant social observer who also retreated into a private world in his hideaway in Rye, Sussex. This exhibition claims his art is largely about “queer culture” yet his actual sexuality is mysterious – not that you’d know that from the show. He painted in watercolour, wildly stretching this medium’s possibilities. He is an odd, cussed, unique figure.View image in fullscreenExperiments in releasing the unconscious … Gorgon by Ithell Colquhoun.Illustration: Spire Healthcare/Noise Abatement Society/SamaritansHow reactionary? Well,he sympathisedwith General Franco’s far-right forces in the Spanish civil war. He didn’t share thewidespread beliefof his generation that the Spanish fight was a struggle for humanity’s future against the rising forces of fascism. Yet Tate Britain puts Burra’s Spanish civil war art at the heart of its fitful show without acknowledging his well-known position. In fact it goes further and tries to present him as a great artist of modern conflict.I don’t see it. Burra’s big, busy, booming watercolours seem to treat the war as a gaudy spectacle, a horrorshow ballet, and have more pity for broken architecture than slaughtered people. Harlequins and devils cavort in the ruins but there is no precision about the war’s victims – look to Picasso’s Guernica for them.In Burra’s Beelzebub, a naked big-bummed devil presides with sensual joy over a nude battle of muscular erotic soldiers in a crumbling bombed-out cathedral: an emphasis on the destruction of churches and killing of clergy as supposed leftist atrocities was typical of pro-Franco imagery. A wall text quotes Burra on the eve of the war: “It was terrifying: constant strikes, churches on fire, and pent up hatred everywhere.” It is the hatefulness he sees in the Spanish workers and Republicans he’s condemning, with their strikes and anti-clericalism.View image in fullscreenPlugged in to the scene … The Band by Burra.Illustration: © The estate of Edward Burra, courtesy Lefevre Fine Art, LondonBurra was out of his depth. He was a party animal not a political pundit. In its first couple of rooms, this show reveals how wondrously hedonistic he can be. In his depictions of Paris nightlife in the late 1920s he is amazed and delighted by French freedom. Women do naked erotic dances at the Folies de Belleville, men dance with men and women with women at a dance hall, and sailors chat each other up at a bar.The exhibition, structured as a series of highlights from his career, doesn’t explain how Burra, born in 1905, came by his singular style, at once precise, comic, sensual and grotesque. But by the time he went to France it was fully formed. Hogarth was one source. The British tradition of caricature dynamises The Tea Shop, from 1929, in which two prudishly polite women in the foreground, one in spectacles that stress her myopia, look idiotically at us, unaware that the waiting staff behind them, male and female, are stark naked. They’re a couple of squares who don’t get the 20s scene.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Though based in tranquil Rye and suffering with rheumatoid arthritis, he would go anywhere for fun. The jazz records he loved are on show – and playing distractingly – and in his paintings of New York and other US cities, jazz and queerness lead him to riotous venues where you might not have met many white Englishmen. In his 1937 picture Izzy Orts, he takes you to the heart of the night where a sailor stares at you with white, pupil-less eyes, as if in ecstasy. At the rear of the crowd you see Burra himself, his pupils also on the point of vanishing. You can hear the noise, smell the smoke, anticipate, as Burra seems to, the sex.Yet this exhibition insists on sentimentalising him. Burra’s paintings of African Americans are presented as acts of allyship with the Harlem Renaissance, but he wasn’t doing portraits of Langston Hughes or hanging out with Zora Neale Hurston. His Harlem scenes are Hogarthian city scenes bursting with raw reality and like any caricaturist he’s ambivalent. Is he celebrating the tall, bandy legged man smoking in the street with a white eye showing under his green hat, or mocking him?The most pleasurable works in Burra’s show are his late landscapes of green rolling Sussex hills which swallow you up. These paintings also depict petrol stations and other modern blights wrecking his beloved countryside, but it seems not just a stretch but nonsensical for a wall text to claim he was “prescient” about the climate crisis. Was he an occultist like Colquhoun after all, gazing into his crystal ball? Tate Britain creates a fantasy version of Burra, removing his complexities, turning a genuinely important artist into a plastic fiction.

Her first words set the tone – “You want to fuck me,” she says – and lead us into an uncompromising introduction, littered with sex, violence and sideways jokes.She is the creation of French-English actor and writer Lily Sinko, and as her character’s name suggests, we’re hurled through a life of saintliness and sin, despair and redemption, as Magdalena does the best with the hand she’s dealt. We travel to her childhood in Marseille with a hostile “Papa”, an airport abduction that sees her deposited at the Virgin Mary School for Bad Bad Girls (Cash Only), and a wild escape through the streets of France, finding fleeting refuge in a cathedral.It’s a tour de force performance from Sinko. She rages, writhes, provokes and teases her way through Magdalena’s life story. Whether she’s in a high-kicking fight, scrabbling for a missing passport, or falling to her knees at a possible sign from a possible god, Sinko’s commitment is total, her presence enthralling.Often, the story itself feels secondary in comparison. The bare bones of Magdalena’s tale are horrifying – endless abuse and exploitation – but every detail is cartoonishly heightened (an eyeball dislodged by a stiletto, stealing camembert from the mouth of a stranger). It plays out as a surreal farce, filtered through our oversexualised storyteller. Tonally, that’s challenging at times, leaving us in limbo between laughs and deeper investment in the narrative. We skim the surface of bigger ideas. Parallels are drawn between Magdalena’s treatment in her father’s house, at the brothel and within the church. Questions are asked about who is worthy of redemption.But while Magdalena might not inspire profound revelations, Sinko ensures there is never a dull moment.AtPlayhouse East, London, until 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Those references have become important in my work’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 11 Jun 2025 10.41 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 13.43 EDTShareIwas raised in a single-parent household by my mum and we’re very close. She is a nurse, but she also did a lot of flower-arranging. I would often go to hang around the florists with her and her arrangements were always around the house. When I was a kid she was also a Sunday school teacher and would run arts and crafts workshops at church. I think I began to appreciate colour, how to match things, and develop taste, from there. My sister also studied fashion – and I was always in her bedroom as that’s where I would go to watch TV. She would have all these posters from Dazed and Vogue, Nick Knight photographs, pictures of Naomi Campbell. I thought it was rubbish at the time, but in hindsight I can understand how those references have become important.This image was the cover of my book, Regina, which was a massive moment in my career, featuring all the work I have done up to now, aged 26. A lot of it, and the way I see the world in general, is down to the women in my life. This image was an opportunity to celebrate them and show the strength of motherhood.My mum allowed me to see life in pink, regardless of our situation – something I always want to pay homage to. She always told me she knew from very early on, from when I was in the womb, everything I would do, to this day. I believe that our lives are written before we are even born. This image speaks to those things, to new life. I’ve always felt as if my life is like a movie.We used a prosthetic belly in the shoot. I had wanted to cast someone who was pregnant, but we weren’t able to do that in the timeframe, but I felt it was an important image to make in spite of that. There’s a strength I always want to show – a lot of my inspiration comes from old family photographs of my grandparents looking super proud, wearing their traditional Nigerian clothes.A lot went into the beautiful, bold simplicity of this moment – I can only take so much creditMy images are fashion but I always want to show the cultural resonances of those poses, the way people express themselves. I encourage everyone I work with to express themselves in a way that they feel is genuine. Each shoot is a mashup of everyone’s efforts, and I’m proud of that. A lot went into the beautiful, bold simplicity of this moment. I can only take so much credit.From the second I decided to pick up a camera I knew that fashion was the best medium for me to express myself. There are no limits, it’s all possibilities – which is what I am most attracted to. I do feel a responsibility, as a Black photographer, to create timeless work. One day I’ll raise Black daughters, and I will need to explain things to them, and the role I played in the way they see themselves.The titles I give my works are all possible names for my future daughters. Selah came from my mum reading me the Book of Psalms before I went to sleep. I’m also a fan of Lauryn Hill, who named her daughter Selah. I chose Regina as the title of the series and the book because I wanted something that had that meaning of queen, of someone regal, without individually naming those women in my life that the work is for.I have always had confidence in my ability to create a good image that is challenging and doesn’t just conform to the industry standards. I’ve been creating my own audience so I don’t have to worry what everyone else thinks. I’ve been unapologetic from the outset and I feel like people understand what I’m trying to do. But havingsuch a big show in Londonaged 26 is insane. Coming through the space, I felt exhausted and I wondered when I found the time to do all this stuff. It’s great this exhibition is happening in my home city too – I’ll never get used to the idea of people leaving the house to go and look at my work on a wall. I generally don’t ask my mum or my sister about what they think of my work, but my mum was at the opening, and I asked her for the first time how she felt about it. She said: “I’m not surprised at all. It’s what I’ve been praying for.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Parry/PAGabriel Moses CVBorn:London, 1998Trained:Self-taughtInfluences:“My mum.”High point:“My first picture.”Low point:“Manchester United losing the 2011 Champions League final.”Top tip:“Never stop asking questions.”Gabriel Moses – Selah is at180 Studios, London,until 27 July.Explore more on these topicsPhotographyMy best shotArtBlack British culturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The offhand magic ofNashvilleis that it feels modest, despite a who’s who of two dozen stars convening for an epic that offers Music City as a microcosm for America herself. Rarely are great films this casually profound.Fifty years later, Nashville has pollinated many more ensemble productions that brings their casts together under a large thematic umbrella, including plenty more from Altman, such as A Wedding, The Player, Short Cuts and his swan song, A Prairie Home Companion. But while other films of the era had attempted to work on a similar scale, like Irwin Allen disaster pictures or Stanley Kramer productions, Altman was attempting to reinvent what films could be, which proved a much harder path, even at a time when the auteur lunatics were running the studio asylum. Though Nashville turned out to be the rare Altman hit, it was bankrolled by a record company. Hollywood didn’t have the nerve for Altman’s narrative experiment.Working from a script by Joan Tewkesbury, who had also written his superb Depression-era crime drama Thieves Like Us the year before, Altman turns Nashville into a slice of life that seems to stumble by accident into a bigger cultural moment. The overlapping dialogue on the soundtrack marks the film as unmistakably his own, and it challenges the audiences to listen in, as if they’re eavesdropping from a nearby table. The effect is an almost documentary-like naturalism, in which characters on their own individual trajectories collide and break apart, leaving a trail of dialogue behind them. Some of that dialogue is hilariously low-key, some barely intelligible, some flashing with insight into this vast constellation of human experience. Altman doesn’t ask the audience to pick up on all of it, just to immerse themselves in his world.The music alone makes it easy, with several of the actors composing the songs they are asked to sing in the film, like the rival country and western crooners played by Ronee Blakley and Karen Black, and Keith Carradine, who won an Oscar for I’m Easy, a folk song that references the many notches on his character’s bedpost. Though Altman’s perspective on the music industry oscillates between contempt and affection, the sheer variety of performances in Nashville is astounding, starting with an early sequence in which Haven Hamilton (Henry Gibson) is recording a patriotic bicentennial anthem in one studio while Linnea, a white gospel singer (Lily Tomlin), lays down tracks with a Black choir in another. Everyone is so desperate to make it, in fact, that there’s an open mic in the middle of a stock car race.Other than the stages at Opryland USA, the unifying event in Nashville is a fundraising gala for a third-party candidate named Hal Philip Walker, who never actually appears on screen but whose platform drones through the loudspeakers atop his campaign van. His views are hard to place on the political spectrum, but his grievances make him sound like the uncle everyone dreads having home for Thanksgiving. (“Let’s consider our national anthem. Nobody knows the words … ”) With a US presidential election coming the next year, Walker’s organizers (Ned Beatty and Michael Murphy among them) are trying to wrangle marquee names like Haven and Barbara Jean (Blakley) to perform at the Parthenon, the city’s replica of the Greek temple.Though the final sequence at the Parthenon brings the film to a shocking yet poignant conclusion, Altman and Tewkesbury stage a journey of constant detours, with a particularly sharp emphasis on the shared dreams of fame and the often humbling road to get there. For women in particular, it’s an ugly minefield of gatekeepers and misogynists, whether it’s Barbara Jean’s temperamental husband/manager (Allen Garfield) micromanaging her affairs, Tom (Carradine) playing seduce-and-destroy, or would-be up-and-comers exposing themselves to open mic crowds. In the film’s most devastating scene, a beautiful waitress (Gwen Welles) with an unfortunate voice gets coerced into turning a singing gig into an impromptu striptease act. Such is the abattoir of celebrity.Other familiar faces may be limited to minor contributions in Nashville, but they’re all like excerpts from short stories that tease your imagination and make you wonder more about them. Shelley Duvall keeps popping up in a funny role as Martha, a star-obsessed scenester who calls herself “LA Joan” and keeps sidling up to good-looking musicians, despite ostensibly being in town to visit her dying aunt. Geraldine Chaplin ambles around with a recorder, claiming to be a BBC documentarian, but she winds up serving as the film’s de facto guide, with odd diversions like a poetic monologue about the junkyard. Elliott Gould andJulie Christieplay themselves as big-time movie stars, which has the effect of connecting Altman’s fictional milieu with the real world. Who’s to say what’s authentic?The assassination of JFK and other political leaders over the previous decade haunts the finale of Nashville, which assembles all its characters for a piece of historical destiny. Though it’s Altman’s instinct to be pessimistic about politics and the coarsening soul of the country, the same generous spirit that brought all these characters to life shines through in a chorus that speaks to the best of humanity. The ending is tragic and beautiful, embodying the many Americas refracted through Altman’s lens for over half a century.Explore more on these topicsRobert AltmanNashvilleLily TomlinShelley DuvallJulie ChristieDrama filmsCountryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rather than saying yes to everything, I became more open, present and patientElizabeth McCaffertyWed 11 Jun 2025 01.55 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 01.57 EDTShare‘Are you afraid of dying, or are you afraid of not living?” Last year, I was sitting in a circle of strangers – half Buddhist monks, half morbidly curious members of the public – when someone asked one of the most profound questions I had ever heard. I was at a “death cafe”, at my local Buddhist centre in south London. A plate of biscuits was passed around while people nursed mugs of hot tea. At 29, I was one of the youngest attending the informal chat about death and dying, which was part of an initiative to encourage more open conversations about the ends of our lives.During the session, people reflected on the lives of those they had lost. Stories were shared about the joyful moments they had had together. A woman asked me why I would want to come to something like this, at my age. I looked around before revealing more than I had ever told my own friends and family.I began to talk about how, for a long time, I had considered suicide. Throughout my late teens and early 20s, I was stifled by my thoughts and anxieties, and often felt misunderstood.After receiving professional help (and an autism diagnosis), I became plagued with guilt and shame that I hadn’t embraced how precious life actually was. I felt regretful for wasting what some people call the best years of their life. I decided to say yes to every opportunity in a bid to catch up on everything I had missed. I took on endless creative projects, went on holidays, wrote books and scripts, made films, and hosted dinner parties.View image in fullscreenElizabeth McCafferty in Gloucestershire last April.Photograph: Courtesy of Elizabeth McCaffertyI’d gone to the death cafe after seeing a poster advertising the meetings.That day, I shared how I’d often fixated on milestones as a way to measure my success, and how I would compare myself with others and feel like a failure. We laughed as we acknowledged how these milestones, like university degrees or property ownership, were never used as a way to describe people who had died.I realised that my newfound zest for life also had its downsides: I felt burnt out, and I hadn’t given myself enough time to savour moments before moving on to something else. After a career in acting, I had become a published journalist almost overnight, but instead of celebrating my new commissions, I gauged my success as a writer by counting how many articles I had written. Similarly, I had acted in multiple major TV productions, but panicked when I didn’t have the next one lined up. I’d spend eight hours making the perfect cake for a friend’s birthday but then be exhausted for the event itself.“The journey is the best bit,” smiled one of the older strangers in the room. “The fun is not knowing what might happen.” I realised that my fear of not living meant my ego was fuelling my choices. My desire to be successful came from my insecurities about feeling like a failure to others. So I needed to focus on how things mademefeel, not just how great they looked or sounded to strangers. My shame over my mental health had made me defensive, as if I owed everyone an explanation as to why I made certain choices. But at the death cafe, I realised that I could thrive in imperfection.I’ve become a much more patient person, and try to be more present when spending time with peopleDuring that evening I met people who were ill, people who believed in reincarnation, parents who had lost children, and a woman who cared for the dying. While many of the questions we had about death were answered, we had to accept that not all of them could be. Before we left, we hugged.A moment that changed me: I went into the wilderness with my family – and lost my inhibitionsRead moreI felt a sense of peace flood over me as I realised that I no longer needed to seek validation from others. Instead, I chose to accept myself and embrace my past. Rather than believing that saying yes to everything is the best way to live life to the fullest, I’ve become more open about communicating my boundaries. I’ve become a much more patient person, too, and try to be more present when spending time with people. While this shift away from pleasing people means I’ve lost some friends, I’ve also gained a stronger bond with others.Since my first visit, I have continued to return to death cafes all over London, meeting new people and having new conversations about death over tea and cake. In truth, I feel more alive than ever for doing so.Elizabeth McCafferty is a journalist who writes regularly for the GuardianIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineon 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counsellor.

My favourites of the genre are either affordable or at leastrelativelyinexpensive, because while I’m disgruntled by many fragrance prices these days, there’s something particularly offensive about a three-figure scent got up to smell like Ambre Solaire.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

What we have here is a comforting, only delicately sweet vanilla, warm, mellow amber and a gentle blend of jasmine and ylang-ylang. A crunch of sea salt enlivens the whole thing. This is a sunny, cheerful and charming scent that can be spritzed on lavishly without guilt or fear of offending.This sunny scent can be spritzed on lavishly without guilt or fear of offendingThe most famous, and perhaps unbeatable tribute to suntan lotion is Estée Lauder’sBronze Goddess Eau Fraîche Skinscent(£58 for 50ml) – not to be confused with the eau de parfum, very different and not as lovely. Also check out their newerBronze Goddess Nuit(£70 for 50ml), which adds an almost creamy, woody note and more musk to the beauty of the original. If you like the original, I think you’ll appreciate this sexier night-time version.Cos’s new fragrance line is strong andSolaireis a highlight (don’t be repelled by the £75 price – the 100ml bottle is two or three times the typical size). Less Bounty ice-cream, more spiced rum and driftwood, its holiday sun-lounger glow still shines through.

Every Saturday, I make a simple rye bread dough, and gather whatever grains, nuts and seeds need using up – from forgotten millet to that last handful of brazil nuts – and soak them overnight. By Sunday lunchtime, the house will be filled with the homely aroma of fresh bread emerging from the oven.The life-changing loafWhen my daughter won’t eat anything but a slice of toast, I want to know she’s still being nourished, so I’ve raised our nutrient baseline by reformulating the recipes for our everyday staples – that is, bread, pasta, porridge and even cakes – with whole grains, omega-rich seeds and nutrient-dense ingredients such asmoringa powder. Of course, every family has its own tastes and comfort foods, so these changes need to be gradual. What matters most is that our children eat a diverse range of fruit and vegetables, but whole grains are also a big win.Today’s dense, sustaining loaf is almost a meal in itself. If your family is more used to white bread, begin by including a little wholewheat flour in your usual dough, then experiment – add a touch of buckwheat flour, say (just 5-10% of the total flour weight), or ancient grains such as khorasan or emmer. Soaked grains and seeds are another easy upgrade, and boost the nutritional value of any loaf, while a few raisins or chopped dried fruit can help improve the bread’s appeal, especially to children.The diversity in this loaf isn’t just good for our bodies, it’s vital for the planet, too. By incorporating a wider range of grains and seeds into our diets, we help support agricultural diversity beyond the traditional big four – wheat, corn, rice and soy – which currently provide 60% of the world’s plant-based calories. These industrial monocrops rely heavily on synthetic inputs and intensive farming, while many traditional and alternative grains thrive with fewer interventions. Each time we choose buckwheat, millet or rye, we cast a small but meaningful vote for a more resilient food system.When blending flours, keep at least 50% of the mix as dark rye or glutenous flour such as wholewheat or emmer. Avoid using too much buckwheat – 100-200g is plenty – because it can turn gummy. That said, this recipe also works beautifully with 100% dark rye or wholewheat flour. I don’t add salt or molasses to the mix, because our young baby eats this bread, too, so we try to keep sodium and sugar low. That said, adding either or both will enhance the loaf’s flavour.Traditionally, this kind of loaf would be baked in a Pullman-style tin with a lid – I use a large tin, about 33cm x 10cm. If you have a thermometer or probe, bake until the centre reaches 96C, though it’s also a forgiving bread if you don’t. The key is to let the loaf set fully, so leave to cool for at least five hours before slicing, and ideally wait until the next day to do so. I usually slice it thinly and store in an airtight container – it keeps well in or out of the fridge; it freezes beautifully, too.Makes1 loafFor the seed mix350g whole grains– buckwheat, pearl barley, brown rice, quinoa, oat groats, rye berries, etc350g mixed seeds, dried fruit and nuts– sunflower seeds, linseed, pumpkin seeds, raisins, dried apricots, goji berries, brazil nuts, walnuts, hazelnuts, etc2 tsp caraway seeds(optional)1 tbsp sea salt(optional)50ml molasses or honey(optional)For the dough550g dark rye flour, or a mixture of flours if you have bag ends that need using (wholewheat bread flour, buckwheat, emmer, etc), plus extra for dusting1½ tsp instant dried yeastOil, for greasingThe night before baking, in a large bowl mix the whole grains, the mixed seeds, dried fruit and nuts and 650g cold water. Add any or all of the optional ingredients, stir well, then cover and leave to soak at room temperature overnight.In a second large bowl, mix the flour, yeast and 350g cold water to form a stiff dough, then cover and leave to sit alongside the soaking grain mix.The next day, grease one large or two small loaf tins with a little oil, then line with baking paper or dust with flour. Tip the soaked grain mix into the dough, mix thoroughly until well combined, then scrape into the tin(s). Smooth out the top, dredge with flour, cover and leave to prove at room temperature for one to four hours, until the dough is well risen and the flour topping has cracked.Bake at 250C (230C fan)/490F/gas 9½ for 30 minutes, then turn down the heat to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 and bake for another 30 to 40 minutes, until dark brown on top. Turn out on to a wire rack and leave to cool completely for at least five hours before slicing, ideally the next day.Explore more on these topicsNuts and seedsWaste notBreadFoodFood wasteBakingFruitCereals and grainsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While the idea went against every fish-cooking mantra we knew, a large, fatty fish actually stands up rather well to a fairly long boil, and the process firms it up nicely, so you can pick up chunks of fish while leaving the bones (essential to give body and flavour to the broth) in the bowl. Our all-time favourite version of this dish was at the now defunct Jeju Hang restaurant in Seoul, where they served it with plump, broth-imbued half-moons of Korean radish and a condiment of fermented cutlass fish innards, as well as perfectly steamed rice. The salad, meanwhile, is a seasonal take on one of Jeju Hang’s side dishes (the original used seaweed instead of asparagus), and its mild, nutty, herbaceous flavour is the perfect foil to the sweet, spicy fish.Hard-boiled fish with Korean radish (pictured top)Source your mackerel carefully, because many UK fisheries are now so overfished as to be unconscionable – the ones we use are line-caught in the southwest, which is one of the UK’s few remaining sustainable mackerel fisheries; otherwise, use big fat herrings instead. Most large supermarkets sell gochujang (Korean fermented chilli paste) nowadays, while doenjang (Korean soybean paste) and gochugaru (Korean chilli powder) can both be found in any Asian supermarket (the doenjang can, at a pinch, be replaced with miso). As for the kelp, while it’s edible and very tasty, its main purpose is to impart umami to the broth and fish. Steamed rice is a non-negotiable alongside.Prep20 minCook30 minServes4For the seasoning sauce120g soy sauce120g mirin40g peeled garlic(about six or seven cloves), roughly chopped10g ginger, peeled and roughly chopped15g doenjang15g gochujang30g fish sauce15g gochugaruFor the fish1 mooli, peeled and cut into 2cm-thick rounds (about 500g)2 small onions, peeled and thinly sliced (about 250g)2 large sustainably-sourced mackerel, or herring, heads and guts removed, then cut across the bone into large chunks (800g-1kg net weight)10g kelp(kombu), or about ½ standard sheetA few finely sliced spring onions, to serveSteamed rice, to serveFirst make the seasoning sauce. Put all the ingredients in a food processor and blitz smooth.Lay the mooli rounds in a single layer in a wide, shallow saucepan, then layer the sliced onion, fish and seaweed on top. Pour the seasoning sauce over the whole lot, then add enough water just to cover the fish. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat so the broth is at a lively simmer, and cook for 20-25 minutes, regularly basting the fish, until the fish is cooked through, the mooli is tender and the sauce is reduced.Ladle into bowls, garnish with a handful of sliced spring onions and serve with steamed rice.Asparagus salad with mashed tofu and pine nut dressingView image in fullscreenKyu Jeong Jeon and Duncan Robertson’s asparagus salad with mashed tofu and pine nut dressing.Prep10 minPress15-30 minCook20 minServes4½ small block firm tofu(about 140g)50gpine nuts(about 3 tbsp), plus extra for serving1 garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped1tsp readymade English mustard1tbsp rice vinegar1 tsp honey2 red dates, pitted and roughly chopped (optional but recommended)2-3 tbspdashibroth, or waterSalt andblack pepper2 bunches asparagus(English, ideally), woody stems removed (about 500g net)Wrap the tofu in kitchen paper or muslin, put a heavy object on top (a can of beans will do) and leave for 15-30 minutes, to press out some of the moisture– the tofu needs to be very dry for this dish.Toast the pine nuts in a dry frying pan, tossing them continuously, for three or four minutes, until nicely golden brown all over and the kitchen is filled with the intoxicating aroma of freshly roasted nuts. Tip the nuts into a mortar or food processor, then grind to a powder. Roughly chop or crumble the tofu, add it to the mortar or processor, then mash until smooth.Add the garlic, mustard, vinegar, honey and red dates, if using, then pound or process again until smooth. Add just enough dashi (or water) to loosen the mix to a thick, creamy dressing, then season with salt and pepper to taste.Cook the asparagus in a pan of salted boiling water for about three minutes, so the spears are cooked but still have some bite to them, then drain and refresh under cold water. Drain again and dry on a clean tea towel or kitchen paper.Arrange the asparagus on a platter, spoon over the tofu dressing, and serve sprinkled with a few extra toasted pine nuts, if you like.Kyu Jeong Jeon and Duncan Robertson are chefs/co-owners ofBokmanandDongnae, both in BristolExplore more on these topicsFoodKorean food and drinkMain courseFishSeafoodRiceSaladrecipesShareReuse this content"

I can ejaculate alonewhen I masturbate, but not with a partner. This is becoming a problem as my partneris complaining about my inability to ejaculate when Iam with her. I am now over30 and it is starting to get me worried. Is there any treatment or help I can get? I really love this woman andfind her sexy, but Iam notable to get to the point of ejaculation.The transition from solo sex to satisfying partner sex is not always easy. Some people become so accustomed to particular types of touch, pressure or strokes during masturbation that they find switching to the different sensations with another person extremely challenging. In addition, some people require intense focus to achieve orgasm or ejaculation, and the anxiety or distraction of intimacy with a partner interrupts their usual process.It is possible to retrain your sexual style to accommodate a partner – and although this can best be done with the help of a sexual therapist, you could start by considering your exact needs in terms of the mechanics of your sexual response and encourage your partner to help by trying to replicate it. For example, perhaps you need to ask her to use a firmer or lighter touch during foreplay.If you find that intercourse does not provide you with sufficient stimulation, one strategy is to employ more erotic play that will increase your arousal before penetration. If you think your problem is distractibility or anxiety, you will have to find calming mechanisms that work for you.Essentially, the worry you are feeling about your partner’s complaints is making it more difficult for you to ejaculate and taking the fun out of sex. Hopefully, you can both stop thinking of lovemaking as a task and simply focus on giving and receiving pleasure.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

Here’s what to do if yours goes missing.What to do if your bike is lost or stolenReport the theft to the police and describe the bike in as much detail as possible, giving the model, make and where it was stolen. You should also include a description of any scratches, dents and marks that could help identify it, and a picture if you have one. You can go into your local police station or call 101 in the UK to file a report. Make sure you get a crime reference number.Home insurance policies will often cover your bike when it’s at home but you will probably have needed to pay extra to extend this for when you’re out and about, or if you have a valuable bike. Report the loss to your insurer and give it the crime reference number. Your bike will not be covered if you failed to look after it, such as not locking it securely or with a suitable lock.Declare your bike stolen onBikeRegister, a UK bike database – you can do this even if you have not registered your bike on there before. It will help improve the chances of your bike being recovered if there are pictures and descriptions of the bike, and where it was stolen.Post on bike and cycling forums, such asCycling UK Forum,Bike ForumandCycleChatin case people come across it when looking to buy a new bike.Look on resale sites such as Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace and eBay to see whether someone is trying to sell your bike. You can set up alerts for bikes that are the same make and model. If you find one that looks like yours, alert the police – they may be able to recover it. It is not advisable to set up a sting or try to deal with the case yourself.Alert the local community on neighbourhood forums such as Nextdoor or local Facebook groups and get in touch any bike shops nearby in case someone comes in to the shop and tries to sell one that matches your description.What to do when you get a new bikeScuff the frame up a bit using sandpaper, paint and stickers so it is less appealing to thieves. Some kitsch, drawn-on hearts might save you a lot of hassle in the future.Register it onBikeRegisterand upload pictures alongside the frame number, which is usually found on the bottom bracket shell between the pedals or on the rear dropouts where the back wheel slots in. This will help the police trace it back to you if it is stolen and recovered.Invest in two high-quality locks to make your bike less of a target. At least one of these should be a good-quality D-lock. Be sure to attach the frame to the stand when locking up.Take any removable parts with you whenever you leave it.Find and apply for your nearest cycle parking. This gives another layer of protection, but be sure to still lock up securely. In cities there are also many cycle hangars, such as Cyclehoop, which are small bike stores on residential streets you can apply for at a small cost each year.Check whether there’s one near you.Conceal a Bluetooth tracker on your bike to help locate it if it goes missing. The smaller and more discreet the tracker, the better. Good spots to hide them include under the seat or inside the handlebar. Apple AirTag and Tile Sticker are popular among bike owners.Explore more on these topicsCyclingLost or stolenConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.We all make mistakes. Mistakes are fine. The trick when shopping for clothes is to avoid making the same ones over and over again, because that can get dispiriting, and when it comes to purchases, mistakes can be expensive. Awful to spend the money and not feel the benefit. Not to mention the state of the planet. So, in the interests of not feeling like a broke, evil carbon-guzzler with nothing to wear, here are my golden rules of changing-room decision-making.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.1. Wear clothes without buttons – and slip on shoesBuying the right clothes starts with wearing the right clothes when you go shopping. You need to streamline your changing room manoeuvres. Wear shoes that you can slip off and on. If you are only looking at dresses, then wear a dress for speed; otherwise wear loose separates. You will have a better sense of whether that boho blouse works if you are trying it on with your favourite jeans, than standing there in your knickers. Also, pack a tote bag so that you aren’t buying bags and can comfortably carry any purchases on your shoulder.2. Be an early birdThe best time to shop is the first hour or two of the day. Shops are much less crowded, the rails are freshly stocked and the staff are less weary.3. Always try on two sizesThe size you think-slash-hope you are, and the bigger one. And when you get into the changing room, don’t even glance at the label, just try either one and judge whether it would look better more fitted or looser. If you are in between sizes, go bigger. It’s easier to have clothes taken in than let out.4. Look yourself in the eye when you try things onLook at your body language as much as the clothes. You should be feeling yourself. You should be looking at yourself in the mirror a bit like, “well hellooo, hot stuff”. You should find yourself slightly showing off to your own reflection. When you find something great, you can feel it in your bones and see it in your eyes.You will not find the clothes that will change your life if you only try on replicas of what you have at home5. Don’t let sequins, feathers and logos turn your headThe most common mistake is buying too many party outfits, and too many boring basics. The clothes that have the most cheering impact on your life are in the sweet spot in between: pieces you can wear on a normal day to make you feel special. Interesting, but not dramatic. Look for those.6. Investigate categories that are outside your comfort zoneLook for newness. “I never wear trousers in that shape/dresses in that length” is not a useful train of thought. This is your moment to try out a palazzo pant or a shirt dress or a waistcoat, or whatever it is that you don’t already have. You will not find the clothes that will change your life if you only try on replicas of what you have at home.7. Ask yourself: when will I wear this?Good answers include: to work tomorrow; to birthday drinks at the weekend. Bad answers include: when I get invited to the Met Gala; when I lose 10lb.8. Do not get distracted by the sale railDoesn’t matter how cheap it is, it isn’t a bargain if you don’t love it.9. Think outside the changing room bubblePlan how you will leave the house in these clothes. A strapless maxidress? You are going to need a jacket or a knit that works on top. If you can’t think of anything you have at home, think again. If a new dress also requires you to buy new shoes and a new coat, it’s probably not the dress for you.10. Don’t buy it in a colour you don’t wearIf a bright colour doesn’t feel right for you, get it in navy or white. I know this sounds boring but well-made pieces in good silhouettes in neutral colours are the clothes you will love for ever.

Today, Somerset is still somewhere where seasons are felt vividly, as Sophie Brendel and Panu Long discovered when they and their two children moved to Thornfalcon, their farmstead in a village of the same name, 15 minutes’ drive from Taunton, at the end of 2022. Here, they are on constant weather watch, tending their young vines (Panu, now a winemaker, has a background in the drinks industry) and harvesting daily from the kitchen garden. They are also busy making plans for the apple harvest, which will go into the 150-year-old cider press.Somerset mapIn addition, they have created a handful of places to stay on their 16-hectare (40-acre) site, which sprawls through woods, orchards and vines to a reed-fringed lake. Walking around it at the end of May, you feel the cusp of summer, from the water lilies coming into bloom and the nesting swan, guarded by her mate. “Soon the eggs will hatch, and later she’ll teach the cygnets to fly, before taking them down to the Somerset Levels,” says Sophie.The Coach House is filled with antiques and beautiful textiles, which hint at Sophie’s years as a director at the V&AMy cabin, the Vine Hut, is surrounded by wildflowers overlooking rows of champagne grape varieties. Inside, nature is just as enveloping: nasturtiums climb over the bedroom wallpaper, a blousy bunch of homegrown peonies sits on the dining table. Behind the orchard, the Lambing Shed’s interior is clad in textured band-sawn planks and the bed’s headboard is painted with apple blossom. In front of the family’s blue lias stone farmhouse is the two-bedroom Coach House, filled with antiques and beautiful textiles, which hint at Sophie’s years spent among pattern and design as a director at the V&A. The latest arrival is a vardo Gypsy wagon with floral patterned ceiling, which sleeps two children as extra accommodation for families staying in the cabins.As the sun creeps out, I wander back to the lake, Mr Swan still patrolling in case I had a mind for a dip. Instead I sit in the wooden sauna – the big picture window frames the scene as swifts dip, and the mental ticker tape of to-do lists begins to melt away. There’s a hot tub outside too, and nearby an old boat house has been turned into the wild treatment room, where local therapist Gemma undoes some of the rest of my knots as the bird calls carry in off the water. Both cabins have outdoor baths of their own, although the plum spot at the Vine Hut after dinner is a pair of adirondack chairs, positioned just so to catch the sunset.View image in fullscreenThe Quantocks, seen from Cothelstone Hill in Somerset.Photograph: James Osmond/AlamyThe next morning, in the sunny, green-painted kitchen, I make breakfast with blue-shelled eggs from the brood of Legbar chickens. There’s the option to have a box of just-picked Thornfalcon produce in your cabin on arrival, or Sophie and Panu are full of recommendations for eating nearby, from roasts at theDinnington Docksto something smarter at theBarrington Boar. Afterwards, I take the short stomp through the village and up Thorn Hill (known as “the clump” for its wooden top), where baby bunnies dart from hedgerows. A patchwork of green rolls away to the edge of the Quantock Hills. There are other walks from the door, looping round through the village of North Curry – where you can pick up a duck sausage roll at theBird in Handpub, which is in the process of reopening and is currently serving pints and street food from a converted wagon outside. Slightly farther away, you can strike out around Cothelstone Hill to spot the herd of Exmoor ponies and bronze age burial mounds, or rent paddle boards from theSomerset Boat Centreto float along the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal.View image in fullscreenOwners Sophie and Panu with their Gypsy caravanA current of creativity also flows through this corner of Somerset, and later that morning I meet Buc Dennis at his family’sDennis Chinaworksin an old stable block outside Shepton Beauchamp (open Monday to Friday, and weekends by appointment). Visitors can buy beautiful vases and jugs, with patterns hand drawn by Buc’s mother, Sally Tuffin, a former fashion designer now in her 80s.It’s not the only creative family hub in these parts, and afterwards I swing by the Temperleys’Burrow Hill Cider Farm. The familiar Glastonbury cider bus is parked outside, the pumps fired up on Saturday afternoons, when local families spread picnic blankets between the apple trees, entertained by food trucks and circus troupes. Across the yard, Mary Temperley’sMake storeis stocked with zesty body washes (also in bathrooms at Thornfalcon), baskets woven in Ghana and suzanis stitched in Jaipur.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This summer, the first bottles of wine and cider will be ready; there are plans to take beekeeping courses and plant lavender fields; and to host feasts, yoga classes and painting workshops in a lovely old barn. It’s inspiring to be around, and equally, easy to dip into as much or as little as you choose.

The latest buzzy supplement? Psyllium husk.“Psyllium husk has become popular thanks to a wave of social media influencers and wellness personalities touting its ability to suppress appetite, regulate digestion and even mimic the effects of more costly medications,” says Lena Beal, spokesperson for the Academy ofNutritionand Dietetics. But comparing it to Ozempic is “oversimplified and misleading”, she warns.On TikTok, more than 12,500 videos boast the psyllium husk tag. But this substance is not new; it has long been popular in India and across south Asia.Is psyllium husk a miracle weight-loss substance? No. But there are benefits, experts say.What is psyllium husk?The outer covering of any seed is called a husk. Psyllium husk comes from the seed ofPlantago ovataplants, a type of shrub thatgrowsin sandy deserts and steppes.In the US, “it is best known as the active ingredient in over-the-counter laxatives like Metamucil”, says Beal.Psyllium husk can be consumed in pill or powder form. It can also be consumed whole, when is resembles tiny wood shavings. When combined with water, it creates a gloopy, gel-like substance.What are the benefits of psyllium husk?That gloopiness may not sound appealing, but it’s part of what makes the product useful.Psyllium husk is a good source of soluble fiber, explains Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. Soluble fiber – unlikeinsoluble fiber, which remains unchanged during digestion – attracts water during digestion and turns into a gel.This gel can soften stools and add bulk to them, which helps in the management of constipation and diarrhea, says Julia Zumpano, a registered dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic Center for Human Nutrition.What is okra water and is it good for your health?Read moreAdditionally, Zumpano says, this gel can bind with the bile in your gut, which is composed of cholesterol, and remove it with the body’s waste, thus reducing the amount of cholesterol in your body.Beal points to a 2018 meta-analysis in theAmerican Journal of Clinical Nutritionwhich found 10-15g of psyllium husk a day significantly reduced LDL (or “bad” cholesterol) and total cholesterol in “healthy individuals and those with high cholesterol”.By slowing the rate of glucose in the bloodstream, it can also help in blood sugar management, says Zumpano.Psyllium husk can also increase one’s overall consumption of fiber, a significant benefit given that only 5% ofpeoplein the US and 9% ofadultsin the UK eat the recommended amount of 25-30g of fiber a day. Psyllium husk provides about 7g of fiber per tablespoon.Eating fiber in any form has many benefits, says Zumpano, including “slowing down digestion and increasing satiety, which are both benefits of weight-loss drugs”. (She is careful to add that fiber does not accomplish either of these outcomes to the extent GLP-1s can.)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She suggests starting with a powder form, which gives you control of the amount.What are the risks of psyllium husk?Experts emphasize that it’s extremely important to consume psyllium husk with enough water:roughly500ml of water per 20g of fiber.Because psyllium husk expands quickly with liquid, without an adequate amount of water, it can become a choking hazard and potentially lead to gastrointestinal obstruction, says Beal.This also means it may not be ideal for everyone. “People with swallowing difficulties, bowel strictures or severe gastrointestinal conditions like Crohn’s disease should consult a healthcare provider before using psyllium,” says Beal.Fiber and psyllium can also potentially interact with certain medications, warns Zeratsky, so consult a doctor or pharmacist before taking it.Also, thinking of it as “nature’s Ozempic” comes with its own risks, experts say.Overconsumption can lead to digestive discomfort, she warns, adding that people may overly rely on a single ingredient instead of a “holistic lifestyle change”.If psyllium husk isn’t your thing, there are plenty of other foods that offer similar benefits, says Zeratsky.“Fruits, vegetables, beans and other legumes, and whole grains, particularly oats, barley and quinoa, all contain soluble fiber” and a variety of other beneficial nutrients, she says.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyNutrition (Life and style)FoodNutrition (Science)Health & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But growing up in what she describes as a traditional Indian family, that dream had to take a backseat to more conventional markers of success: university, marriage, career.Decades later – after she had married, become a mother and taken a job as a business analyst in Melbourne – she felt the itch return. It was time to do something for herself. So she embarked on a personal challenge: to set a Guinness World Record.Saseendran felt drawn to memory-based challenges and had long been fascinated by aviation. After a lot of research, she set her sights on creating a new world record: naming the most airports identified by International Air Transport Association code in one minute. The process of getting a new record idea approved by Guinness took her a year and three failed applications before the record book finally gave her the green light. So why not just break an existing record?“I know how much effort and time it takes to set a record, so I really don’t want to break anyone’s and mortify them,” she says. “I didn’t want to hurt anyone.”View image in fullscreen‘My “brainchild” will hold a cherished place in my heart forever,’ says Guinness World Record holder Sruthy Saseendran.Photograph: Asanka Brendon Ratnayake/The GuardianSaseendran spent 18 months practising for her record attempt. She built a database of over 17,000 airport codes and assembled a training toolkit that included aviation maps, flashcards, cognitive training apps and good old-fashioned games of chess (to sharpen her focus). She’d set her alarm for 4.30am every day to practise before her infant woke up. As well as memorising codes, she had to learn to speak very quickly so she could verbally identify two airport names each second.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningOn 5 December 2024, it all paid off. After one failed attempt, Saseendran created a new world record,naming 95 airport codesbefore the buzzer sounded. After all that groundwork, claiming her title felt like “relief”.Saseendran’s record might sound obscure, but Guinness is no stranger to niche ideas. Each year, they field about 50,000 record applications, and more than one-third are new titles. Australians are among the more enthusiastic record breakers, currently ranking 12th in the world (the US and UK are equal first). For many, devising an oddly specific new record is a more achievable way into the books than running the fastest marathon or growing the world’s longest fingernails.A steady stream of new records also helps to keep the pages of the hallowed Christmas gift fresh. Most of the records in the book each year are new, cosying up alongside indispensable classics such as the world’s shortest woman and tallest man. New feats also replace records that have been scrapped by Guinness, such a “longest time with a tarantula in the mouth”, which might now be considered animal cruelty.Proposed records need to meet a variety of criteria to get the go-ahead, says Mark McKinley, who vets new Guinness World Record applications.Much likeSmart goals, records need to be specific and measurable. You may think your baby is the world’s most beautiful, McKinley says, and perhaps it is – but there’s no real way to measure that. Guinness must also be able to verify each record. Not all ideas that reach McKinley’s desk tick that box. “We had an application for somebody who claimed to have only ever drunk Coca-Cola their entire life – one, it’s probably unlikely that as a baby they were being bottle-fed Coke, but there’s also no way of proving that,” he says.Experience: I’ve made the longest chain of chewing-gum wrappers in the worldRead moreFinally: “The record’s got to be breakable,” McKinley says. That means standardised parameters – football records, for instance, must be broken with a fully inflated ball of the same size – but it also means setting the kind of challenge other people want to beat.Saseendran’s record idea met all of those criteria. Memory-based records, McKinley says, are among their most popular and there’s a “huge community” of aviation enthusiasts who could be inspired to try for her title.McKinley filters through a lot of record requests and says that suggestions which appear niche at first can reveal large communities of devotees.“When you start looking into them, you find that not only is this person wanting to do it, there’s a whole subculture of people that … will want to beat it.”For instance, McKinley once received an application for the most sausages made in one minute. He was initially dubious, but says “that record has become so popular among butchers”.Records aren’t just about individual achievement. This weekend the New South Wales town of Kyogle, population 2,751, will do its darndest to set a brand new world record: the world’s largest happy dance. If they get it right, it will, thinks mayor Danielle Mulholland, “really put us on the map”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She Googled happy dances and found there had been a mass happy dance featuring 448 participants in Singapore in 2015, but it hadn’t officially been recorded by Guinness. So she decided that Kyogle, as a town, should aim to set the first official record by bringing together as many people as possible to dance at the town showgrounds. If you’re wondering, a happy dance entails any kind of dance moves made toPharrell Williams’ 2014 track Happy.Those shooting for Guinness glory can choose to have reputable independent witnesses and videographers there to verify an attempt, or they can fly out official Guinness staff to oversee proceedings. The latter option comes with a price tag of £12,000 or A$24,000 – an amount that made Mulholland “almost stroke out on the spot”, especially given Kyogle is using the event to raise money for anti-domestic violence programs, so she has recruited some local lawyers to verify the size of the dancing crowd.If successful, it won’t be Kyogle’s first entry into the record book – a gardener from the nearby town of Knockrow grew theheaviest pumpkin in the southern hemisphere, an 867kg behemoth, for a Kyogle pumpkin competition in 2021. But creating the mass happy dance record feels extra special.“London, Paris or New York may come along, and they may challenge the record,” Mulholland says. “But at the end of the day, we’ll have done it first.”View image in fullscreenKyogle is using the event to raise money for anti-domestic violence programs.Photograph: Natalie Grono/The GuardianLosing records is all part of the experience anyway. In 2018, chef Johnny Di Francesco, who runs Melbourne restaurant group Gradi, set about creating a world record for the most varieties of cheese on a single pizza. At the time, Di Francesco believed he’d be the first to set such a record, but Guinness says a German restaurant snuck in earlier that year.Di Francesco says it was a huge undertaking. Even sourcing that many varieties of cheese was challenging in Australia. Then, over six hours, Di Francesco painstakingly assembled a standard-size pizza with one gram of each variety of cheese. He “obviously” had to recruit two professional cheesemongers to verify his cheese varieties were sufficiently distinct. It worked out – Di Francesco got the record, cramming 154 cheeses on to a classic wood-fired base.‘People scream in shock’: the US woman with the world’s longest tongueRead moreHe didn’t retain the title. In 2023, a team of chefs from France, a nation with the unfair advantage of being home to many more types offromage, toppled him with a1,001-cheese pizza. But Di Francesco is at peace with the loss.“It’s fine,” Di Francesco says. He still feels a sense of achievement for contributing to “something that someone else wanted to succeed in”.For now, Saseendran still holds her record – but she should steel herself for challengers. McKinley says there have already been five applications to break it.Saseendran can now recite 104 airport codes in one minute – nine better than her official record – but won’t be bitter if she eventually loses the title.“I’m sure I’d be cheering them on,” she says. As she went first, “my ‘brainchild’ will hold a cherished place in my heart forever”.Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleGuinness World RecordsHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But now even the former education secretary who introduced these exams wants to see them abolished ...Sally WealeWed 11 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 00.06 EDTShareIt’s approaching 8.30am on a Wednesday in June and 140 grim-faced teenagers are making their way into an exam hall. Today it’s GCSE maths paper 2 (calculator). A posse of smiling staff encourage and cajole: “Good luck, hope it goes really well.” “Bags at the back please!” “Use a black pen only.” A few stragglers reluctantly make an entrance. “Find your seats quickly, please. Good luck!”Once everyone is seated, there’s the exam prayer. (This is Urswick school, a mixed Church of England secondary in north-east London.) “Heavenly father, be with me as I take this exam, keep my mind alert and my memory sharp, calm my nerves and help me concentrate.” Some candidates bow their heads, others stare glumly into the distance. Then, a few final words of encouragement. “So, year 11, this is your time to shine. Good luck – you have an hour and a half. You may begin.” And they’re off. Welcome to the 2025 summer exam season.GCSEs – the qualifications taken by 15- and 16-year-olds at the end of their secondary education – are well under way in assembly and sports halls across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. But so too is a growing debate about whether it might be time to reform, or even abolish, the exams that have shaped young people’s fortunes for almost four decades. The government’s national curriculum and assessment review, including potential reform toGCSEs, will be published later this year. Not a moment too soon, for many.The GCSE – or general certificate of secondary education – was introduced in 1986, replacing the two-track “sheep and goats” system of O-levels and CSEs (certificate of secondary education). Since then they have undergone several changes, most significantly under David Cameron’s government and the then education secretary Michael Gove, who wanted a more “rigorous” set of qualifications. He increased content, and replaced modules and coursework with end-of-course exams, graded by a number (from 1 to 9, with 9 being the best) rather than a letter.Critics have argued there are too many exams: students in England typically sit between 24 and 31 hours of exams in year 11, which is double, even triple, the totals for countries such as Ireland (16) and Canada (10). They say the curriculum content is vast and unwieldy – teachers struggle to cover it in the allotted time and pupils struggle to master it – and the high-stakes nature of the assessment creates excessive anxiety and stress for teenagers, more of whom now experience poor mental health, particularly since Covid.They are worried about the narrow academic focus, the danger of teaching to the test and the alarmingly high failure rate. Every year, about a third of GCSE pupils across England finish year 11 without achieving a grade 4 pass in English and maths. Then there’s the fact that children in England are nowrequired to remain in education or traininguntil they’re 18, making GCSEs at 16 kind of redundant.The roll call of industry leaders who would like to see them scrapped is growing. Among them are the former Ofsted boss Sir Michael Wilshaw and Kenneth Baker – the former education secretary who introduced GCSEs. They joininstitutions that have spoken out against the exams, such as Eton college, Bedales school, St Paul’s girls’ school and the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. Many teachers, parents and pupils still under the GCSE cosh would concur.“While there is a place for these sorts of exams”, Blairwrote in the Telegraphin 2022, “we cannot rely on them alone: they only measure certain skills, they do not always do this accurately, and they invite narrow teaching styles aimed at passing tests rather than building other key aptitudes.”We’ve created an exam system that perpetuates privilege from one generation to the nextWriting in the Guardian earlier this year,Simon Jenkinscondemned what he described as the destructive cult of the exam, warning it was harming young people. “Just say it,” he urged. “Spit it out. Abolish GCSE. It has nothing to do with young people or their advancement. It has everything to do with quantifying, measuring, controlling and governing their preparation for life.”Then there’s the chronic unfairness of the system. Covid fuelled the attainment gap between rich and poor pupils; now a boom in private tutoring is adding to the sense that there’s a two-tier system, with wealthier families able to pay to secure their children advantages that poorer families cannot afford. According to a 2023 Sutton Trust survey, almost half (46%) of pupils in London received private tutoring, compared with 30% for England as a whole.“GCSEs are failing the fairness test,” says Lee Elliot Major, a professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter. “We must face up to the stark truth that they reward children not just for what they know, but for the resources their families can draw upon – whether it is extensive help via the booming industry of private tutors or the middle-class assumptions embedded in our curriculum that alienate and disadvantage those lacking a particular cultural capital.View image in fullscreen‘Failure is baked in.’Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian“We’ve created an exam system that perpetuates privilege from one generation to the next. Our meritocratic elites, obsessed solely with narrow academic memorisation tests, are losing the bigger political battles over our failure to nurture all talents in society.”Ben Davis, headteacher at St Ambrose Barlow Roman Catholic high school in Swinton, Salford, is among those who want change. “GCSEs have run their course and are not fit for purpose. I’d go so far as to say they are making young people ill and they impoverish teaching.”They are not inclusive, failure is “baked in” and “there is a disconnect between GCSEs and what employers need and expect,” says Davis. They should be replaced, he suggests, with a single diploma-based system for all young people, so that vocational, life skills, apprenticeships and academic qualifications sit alongside one another and pupils can combine these in the way that suits them best.Sammy Wright, head of school at Southmoor Academy in Sunderland and author ofExam Nation: Why Our Obsession With Grades Fails Everyone–and a Better Way to Think About School, agrees the system is ripe for change. “The short answer is that GCSEs are designed to fit an academic trajectory. The model of learning they follow dovetails neatly with A-levels and then university, but that isn’t what many kids do.Personally I would not get rid of GCSEs. They are such a powerful brand and children thrive on the challengeRichard Brown, headteacher“Essentially, GCSEs ask children to try an academic pathway, and then only when they fail do they offer a different version of what education might be. My favoured alternative,” he says, “is a passport qualification, where instead of discrete grades, they get an overall mark, within which there are many different elements. But this is long-term, it must be thought through and not rushed. It’s a decade’s work, really.”It is a huge challenge, says Dr Mary Richardson, professor of educational assessment at UCL’s Institute of Education, “because GCSEs are (a) not ‘bad’ assessments at all; it is the culture they support and breed that is our major societal challenge, and one which I feel adds little value to both education and to the lives of teenagers. And (b) they are part of a massive, corporate assessment industry.“I’ve been castigated in the past for suggesting that we should review national testing of this kind at 16, mainly because there are thousands of jobs that rely on this aspect of our education system. However, if we could invest more money in teacher education, and supporting teachers to assess in schools, then that is a way to reorientate all that expertise in assessment. And by that I mean a really rich type of assessment that adds value to learners and learning, not simply a one-off test situation with limited context.” Maybe, but concerns would doubtless persist about the reliability of and potential for bias in any teacher assessment-based system.View image in fullscreenFormer education secretary Michael Gove, who made changes to GCSEs as he wanted a more ‘rigorous’ set of qualifications.Photograph: Jon Super/APNo prizes for guessing what Britain’s strictest headteacher thinks.Katharine Birbalsingh, who founded the high-achieving Michaela Community School in the London borough of Brent, is a firm supporter of GCSEs. She approved of Gove’s changes and thinks it’s important for children to face challenges such as exams, to help build the resilience that will get them through the vicissitudes of life.Fewer GCSE exams proposed in Labour’s curriculum review – but Sats to stayRead more“Look, GCSEs are not perfect. I would be the first one to say that. All exams have problems. But exams hold institutions to account. It’s not just about holding the children to account. Most of it is about holding the entire system to account.“There needs to be something to set the standard. It’s also the case when it comes to employers that they have some sense of how the child has done. Otherwise it’s just a free-for-all where everybody’s just making up whatever they’re doing.”Richard Brown, headteacher at Urswick, may not see eye to eye with Birbalsingh on everything, but he does agree that GCSEs should be retained, with some changes. “At the end of the day, this is an outcomes-driven business,” he says ruefully. This is his last summer of exams before retirement. “Personally I would not get rid of GCSEs. They are such a powerful brand and children do thrive on the challenge of them.“I can just about remember when I took exams and I’m sure I was nervous, but I went in and did it. That’s grit and resilience, isn’t it? That’s what schools have to look at and make sure their youngsters can deal with setbacks.”GCSEs harm our young people.

Muslim workers are reckoning with the possibility that their jobs go against their religious obligationsJohana BhuiyanWed 11 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 09.30 EDTShareBefore Ibtihal Aboussad was fired byMicrosoftfor protesting the company’s work with theIsraelimilitary during a celebration of the firm’s 50th anniversary, she sent two emails.The first went to all of her colleagues. She appealed to their universal humanity and urged them to stand against Microsoft’s contracts to provide cloud computing software andartificial intelligenceproducts to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).She sent the second to the “Muslims at Microsoft” email list. Its subject line read: “Muslims ofMicrosoft, Our Code Kills Palestinians.”With her email, Aboussad told the Guardian, she wanted Muslim staff of companies such asMicrosoft,Google and Amazonto stop regarding the question of whether they organize against their employer’s work with the IDF as an issue of secular or professional ethics. It was a question of Islam, of their faith, she argued.“I wanted to say, ‘Hey, remember, yourrizq[livelihood] is from Allah,’” Aboussad said. “It should be clean, and you cannot be contributing to oppression.”There’s been protests within American tech companies against their contracts with Israel and its military since the start of the war in Gaza. There have been walkouts and vigils. Offices have been taken over and op-eds have been written. Some staff have resigned and some have been fired for their activism.But as the war endures and Palestinians in Gaza are being starved, forcibly displaced and killed, and the contracts have survived, there’s a growing group of Muslim staffers who are unsure whether they can religiously justify working at companies that they view as effectively defense contractors.View image in fullscreenIbtihal Aboussad participates in a protest in Seattle on 4 April 2025.Photograph: No Azure for ApartheidThe Guardian spoke with nearly a dozen Muslim employees of major tech companies who’ve been grappling with the question, many of whom asked not to be named for fear of professional repercussions or because they are continuing to organize inside the companies.Several of the staffers have resigned or are in the process of resigning. Some said they aren’t convinced that their employers have crossed a line that would force them to quit. Others worried that leaving the company would do more harm than good.Nearly all said that the public protest of Aboussad, and her co-demonstrator Vaniya Agrawal, has pressed the question. And at least for some, the footage of Aboussad – a hijab-clad young woman staring down Microsoft’s AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, and calling him a war profiteer – has been activating.Organizers at No Azure for Apartheid (NoAA), the worker-led group at Microsoft that Aboussad belongs to, and whose name refers to Microsoft’s cloud-computing platform, say that they’ve heard from more staffers looking to get involved with the group since Aboussad’s action. And they’ve heard from more than a dozen workers looking to resign or lodge a protest, and several more who have already done so.Others are on the fence, with some in a constant spiritual crisis over whether they should resign. The reasons vary: some feel they can do more to agitate against these contracts from inside the company, others worry about being able to provide for their families and some worry about trying to find another tech job in a tough market.“Honestly, I’ve been praying about what Allah wants me to do,” one Microsoft employee said. “Because it doesn’t seem like it’s right for a Muslim to continue working for such companies. But if we leave, then there could be a pro-Israeli person who takes our spot, and then you’re not serving the cause by doing this.”OneGoogleworker said they decided it no longer feels halal to remain at the company. But their father doesn’t agree: he argues it’s their “Islamic duty” to stay at the company because the role was a blessing from God. “He said this is self-sabotage,” the worker said.View image in fullscreenMembers of No Azure for Apartheid hold a protest on 20 March 2025.Photograph: No Azure for Apartheid“My parents are like, ‘If you quit, how does that help the cause?’ I don’t think they understand that by quitting I am not trying to help the cause,” the Google staffer said. “I’m at a [spiritual and moral] negative right now. I’m just trying to go back to neutral. Every day my work is actively harming people. I can’t help people if I’m actively harming them.”The debate is not confined to the cafeterias of tech companies. Several tech workers said they have sought the spiritual insight of popular Islamic scholars, including Imam Omar Suleiman, the founding president of the Yaqeen Institute, a Texas-based Islamic research organization. Suleiman is actively engaging with Microsoft workers to help determine “if there’s any part of Microsoft that wouldn’t be considered complicit in this”, he said. The imam said he is still grappling with the question of whether and how urgently Muslims need to quit their tech jobs, leaving the workers to wrestle with it privately for now.“More fields of employment are complicated than not,” Suleiman said. “It’s not always as straightforward as someone that works at a liquor store. It’s someone that works at a grocery store [that sells alcohol].”Big tech’s rising role in the siege of GazaDetails of how big tech works with the IDF have long been murky, and many tech staffers had mostly accepted their employers’ denials or defenses of these contracts. But recently, evidence that the tech industry’s products have been used in Israel’s violent campaign in Gaza, which the UN has concluded is consistent with “the characteristics of genocide”, has been mounting.Microsoft deepened its ties with the Israeli military in the wake of Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attacks, according to a Guardianinvestigationreported in collaboration with +972 Magazine and Local Call, based in part on documents obtained by Drop Site News. Leaked documentsindicatedMicrosoft has a “footprint in all major military infrastructures” in Israel. The Associated Press has also reported that Microsoft technology has aided in Israel’ssurveillanceof Palestinians.Microsoft hasdefendedits contract with the IDF, saying that an internal investigation concluded the firm “found no evidence” that its technology was used by the IDF to target or harm people.Microsoft’s chief communications officer, Frank Shaw, reiterated those findings and said these reports “are not accurate”.“As we stated before in our blog, we have found no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza,” he said in a statement.View image in fullscreenHossam Nasr participates in a protest in 2024.Photograph: Courtesy of Hossam NasrThe company’s investigation did nothing to assuage workers. Hossam Nasr, an organizer with NoAA who was fired by Microsoft afterorganizing a vigilfor Palestinians in 2024, argued there is no way to have an “ethical” contract with a military “whose leaders are wanted by the international criminal court for war crimes”.Google andAmazonboth provide cloud services to the Israeli military and government under a $1.2bn agreement dubbed “Project Nimbus”.Google has maintained that its technology is not aimed at military work, but reporting suggests the tech giant providescloud services as well as advanced AI and machine learning toolsthat directly equip the Israeli military with various features including image and object detection and analysis. Google and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.‘If you do not organize, you must leave’Many of the tech workers the Guardian spoke with said the recent revelations about the depth of their employers’ work with the IDF and the lack of sufficient response to worker opposition to the contracts felt like a mask-off moment, one that left little doubt about their employers’ roles in Israel’s offensive and even less hope that the companies might stop working with the Israeli military.In April, the Boycott, Divest and Sanction (BDS) movement, which seeks to use economic means to protest Israel’s occupation and siege of thePalestinian territories, added Microsoft to its list of companies to boycott, further pressing the issue for many Muslim tech workers.It was ultimately these revelations that moved Aboussad to stage her protest at Microsoft’s 50th anniversary event in April. But there were other factors: in addition to becoming involved with NoAA in February 2025, Aboussad had also started wearing hijab at the end of 2023, and she felt a new responsibility as someone who was more visibly Muslim to represent her faith appropriately and stand in opposition to the company’s contract with the IDF.In her email to Muslim staff, she included an essay written by Hasan Ibraheem, one of severalGoogle workers firedfor occupying the company’s New York office the year before. The essay was meant to serve as a “dire callout to our community”, Aboussad wrote in the email.“To my Muslim brothers and sisters, I offer this essay as a sincere naseeha [advice],” Ibraheem’s essay began. Then he quoted from the prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him):“Whosoever of you sees an evil, let him change it with his hand; and if he is not able to do so, then with his tongue; and if he is not able to do so, then with his heart – and that is the weakest of faith.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIbraheem’s message was simple: Muslims have a religious obligation to stop oppression wherever they see it. Working at a company that contracts with the Israeli government as it continues its decimation of Gaza without doing anything to push back against those contracts was in violation of that obligation. Put bluntly, Muslims have two options, Ibraheem said: to either fight or quit.“If you do not organize, you must leave,” Ibraheem wrote. “And even if you organize, your goal should be to eventually leave. Organizing does not absolve you of complicity indefinitely.”View image in fullscreenHasan Ibraheem.Photograph: Ahmed Gaber/The Guardian“If you know that the company you work for is directly enabling harmful activities, then maybe your money is not completely halal,” Ibraheem said.Aboussad said that in the days after she protested in the meeting, she received dozens of direct messages on Instagram from other Muslim tech workers. Many said she inspired them to do more to oppose their company’s actions, and some said they were even thinking of resigning, Aboussad recalled. One person said her demonstration “removed any excuses” they might have made about not doing more to oppose their employers’ work with the IDF.One confrontation inspires multiple resignationsThe debates aren’t limited to the companies’ US offices. For some workers at Microsoft’s offices across the Middle East and north Africa, Aboussad and Agrawal’s protest was one of the first times they were confronted with the depth of their employers’ work with the Israeli military. For others, their concerns about their roles at the company had long been brewing. One worker, based out of Microsoft’s Cairo office, told the Guardian she had been weary for months of what she saw as a vehement pro-Israeli stance in Microsoft’s internal communications to employees and their lack of mention of the now more than 50,000 Palestinians who have been killed by the IDF.The first time she began to wonder whether she belonged at Microsoft as a Muslim was when the company fired Nasr and another worker after the two organized a vigil for Palestinians.Aboussad and Agrawal’s protest about six months later helped her answer that question, she said. Their demonstration prompted about 100 employees in the Cairo office to take a day off in protest of Microsoft’s work with Israel – an action that was just shy of striking, which is generally illegal in Egypt. On that day, she decided she would quit.“The response of [Suleyman] and [Microsoft CEO] Satya [Nadella] was very dismissive,” she said. “And I think Satya laughed, and that sort of made me feel like, no, I don’t think I belong here, and me staying here is just supporting what they’re doing.”None of the Google or Microsoft workers who spoke to the Guardian had any doubt about whether their employers were contributing to Israeli military operations. But some held out hope the company may switch strategies.One person who has worked at Microsoft for nearly a dozen years said they felt betrayed by the company, which sold them on its 2014 mission of “empowering every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more”. But they remain hopeful that internal pressure might force the company to change its policy on working with the Israeli government.“I know during South African apartheid, the company did flip to the right side,” they said, citing Microsoft’s decision to leave South Africa in 1986 in response to the country’s laws enforcing racial discrimination. “I hope that history repeats itself and they become the company where the culture is that you make everyone feel great.”Meanwhile, workers’ protests have continued. At Microsoft, NoAA hasdisruptedat least two more company events, prompting the company to fire at least one of the workers, Joe Lopez.Another staffer, senior UX designerJasmina Mathieu, resigned publicly, stating in an email to leadership and employees that she could no longer work at a company that directly or indirectly enables “horrific actions done by Israel”. Since then, the Microsoft staffers said, they can no longer send emails to anyone, including human resources, that contained the words “genocide”, “Gaza”, “Palestine” or even “Vaniya Agrawal”. One worker with NoAA, Nisrine Jaradat, was able to get around the block and send an email to all Microsoft staff decrying the policy that “utterly and completely discriminate[s] against an entire nation, an entire people, and an entire community”. Jaradat called on her co-workers to either organize against the company’s work with the IDF or quit.“If you choose to leave Microsoft to no longer be com​plicit in genocide do not go quietly,” Jaradat wrote.A popular imam fields the question: is working in big tech haram?Many workers have consulted with local religious leaders and scholars but have not been given a clear response. “We’ve been wanting to get an opinion that says, you know, ‘Just quit, you should not be working here,’ but we did not,” one Microsoft worker said. “They just say it depends on the situation.”Imam Omar Suleiman has been helping people figure out whether working at certain companies is halal or permissible for the entire 20 years he’s been a religious leader.Over the last two years, Muslims tech workers from around the country have reached out to Suleiman’s Yaqeen Institute with the same question: can I still work at a tech company that is helping power the Israeli military? For Suleiman, tech has been one of the hardest fields to navigate “because you have Muslims that work at various levels and tech companies are involved in this genocide to varying extents”, he said.View image in fullscreenA protester waves a Palestinian flag outside the Seattle Convention Center on 4 April 2025.Photograph: Andres Robles/No Azure for ApartheidWhat Suleiman and the Yaqeen Institute – where Aboussad now works – ultimately decide matters a great deal to tech workers of a certain age. The institute is well regarded among millennial Muslims in the US for its easy-to-digest content on how to understand and apply the teachings of the Qur’an. Suleiman’s videos have garnered him more than 3 million Instagram followers. Nearly every tech worker who the Guardian spoke to cited Suleiman’s speeches shared on social media as inspiration for why they want to leave Google or Microsoft. Yet for Suleiman, who recently gave animpassioned speech, orkhutbah, at a Virginia mosque urging congregants to “have some dignity” and quit their jobs at arms manufacturers, whether Islam requires that these tech workers leave their jobs with the same urgency is still an open question. Like Suleiman’s example of a clerk at a grocery store selling alcohol alongside fruits and vegetables, it is not as clearcut if coding productivity tools poses the same grave transgression as building a bomb.Suleiman and others at the Yaqeen Institute are working on developing a general framework that will help Muslims decide whether they can religiously justify working at any of the tech firms contracting with the IDF. That framework will be published as a resource for both local imams as well as individuals in the midst of a spiritual crisis about their jobs.Suleiman looks at cases from many different sides. Staff have to ask themselves personal questions. Islamic religious law advises all Muslims to leave something that causes them doubt for something that doesn’t. But, he cautions, many cases are complicated. You might be the primary breadwinner of your household, have an employer-sponsored visa or be working at a part of the company that you feel doesn’t have anything to do with the products the firm builds for militaries, such as LinkedIn. One also has to evaluate whether you’re having a positive impact by staying in the company.“There’s room for the person who holds back the hand of the pharaoh from inside the pharaoh’s court,” Suleiman said. “But they have to demonstrate how exactly [they are] minimizing that harm without at any point becoming a mouthpiece for oppression.”And they need to evaluate the workings of their companies, he said. Do they produce haram, or impermissible, products, like alcohol or weapons used to kill people? In those cases, “they need to leave their job and they need to find a different job depending on what layer they participate in and how much need they have”, Suleiman said. Or is the company based around usury or interest-based transactions, which are also impermissible in Islam? In those cases, you can still work at the company, but you should up your charity to offset those haram transactions.While Islamic jurisprudence has an established structure to make these decisions, Suleiman says tech remains a complicated matter to locate within that framework. The imam said he is still in the discovery phase on how the roles workers find themselves in at these companies align with their religious duty.“It’s very hard to compare something that’s just purely generating weapons of mass destruction and a tech company that has a wide array of businesses, but also happens to be manufacturing for a genocide,” he said. “It’s hard for me to figure out when that line disappears.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyIslamMicrosoftGoogleAlphabetAmazonIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Plus letters fromTeresa Loyd-Jones, Ian DawsonandDirk van ShieWed 11 Jun 2025 12.59 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 16.16 EDTShareIt’s arguable whether ID cards could help to either deter illegal immigration or persuade Reform-curious voters to swing back to Labour (Digital ID cards would be good for Britain – and a secret weapon for Labour against Reform, 9 June). On the first, actors in the informal economy are adept at getting around new mechanisms. On the second, a canny political operator like Nigel Farage is just as likely to turn any such move to Labour’s disadvantage.Maybe the benefits of ID cards would outweigh the costs if they could be introduced at the flick of a switch. But the cost and effort would be huge. (The costings produced byLabourTogether look more than optimistic.) So, ID cards might be a “nice-to-have” if the government was on an even keel, with the luxury of time and resources to spare – but it isn’t. The government needs to be much better at focusing finite resources – especially delivery expertise – on the problems that really matter (the NHS, housing, schools) and stop wasting time on things that don’t.Simon RewLondonID cards are the slippery slope to control. When everything in your life is connected to a digital ID, it is simple to ensure that you comply. I am a tax-paying, law-abiding citizen, and if an authority (ie the police) wishes to know my name and address, I am happy to tell them. If they are not happy with my answer and deem that I am committing some offence, they can arrest me.I feel no obligation to prove who I am. What I get very concerned about is giving some authority the ability to control me. I might be part of a peaceful demonstration, protesting against a government decision that I do not agree with. With universal ID, it would be very easy to request a person’s card, record it and then mark someone as a possible dissenter. Let’s not usher something along these lines in to appease the likes ofNigel Farage. Call him out for what he is.My mother, who had to deal with the Nazis in Holland (she was hustled to a German work camp as slave labour) said to me: “Never live in a country that demands you carry an ID.”Anthony BaylisEgham, SurreyGood luck with the proposals for a digital identity system. Recently I tried to log into myHMRCaccount to give my bank details to obtain a tax refund. Although I have had the account since Covid, I was told that I now needed to verify my identity by providing a passport or driving licence. I do not drive and my passport expired a while ago. I am therefore excluded from the app. Will people like me also be excluded from applying for a universal ID?Teresa Loyd-JonesNottinghamPolly Toynbee blithely deals with the obvious risks of identity cards in a couple of lines. She writes that a fairly serious problem like having your “access to everything” cut off would have to be “dealt with instantly by senior enough officials to make robust decisions with rapid appeal to courts not blocked by backlogs”. Since none of that happens in pretty much any part of our society, a lot needs to change before I’d be happy with the BritCard as advertised.Ian DawsonHeywood, LancashireSurely Polly Toynbee was pulling her readers’ collective legs? Every thought in this article appears to pander to Reform’s anti-immigrant prejudices rather than make any kind of argument against them. ID cards, especially on smartphones, are wide open to abuse by any possible future authoritarian government.

But this does nothing to address the worrying situation for the many thousands of Ukrainian students in this country.Despite being refugees, Ukrainians do not have refugee status here – thanks to a lacuna in the agreement between the UK andUkrainethat appears to exclude them from support under part 6 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. Thus, they not only cannot count on free school meals for their children but also any of the additional support which flows to children receiving free school meals.Jess Brown-Fuller, the MP for Chichester, has called for more help to be given to Ukrainian refugees.

He’s not wrong: it’s rife on social media, in podcasts and in YouTube comments. But how did he overlook the edgelord-in-chief himself?Donald Trump is the archetypal edgelord: endlessly provocative, chronically online, allergic to truth and addicted to the attention his outrage generates. He didn’t just dabble in edgelordery for clicks – he built his own social media megaphone to broadcast it. It’s as if Truth Social had been handed the nuclear codes.Chiles writes about edgelords with bemused detachment. But Trump shows what happens when trolling becomes statecraft, and moral vacuity masquerades as “telling it like it is”. This isn’t just an online persona – it’s a governing style with global consequences.Next time Adrian spots an edgelord, he might glance across the Atlantic and realise that we’re all still living with the results.Anthony LawtonChurch Langton, LeicestershireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

If reforested, this would remove 2.2bn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, about the same as all the nations in the European Union.Previous maps have suggested much larger areas have the potential for regrowing trees but were criticised for including important ecosystems like savannahs and not considering the impact on the millions of people who live in or depend on forests.Tree bark plays vital role in removing methane from atmosphere, study findsRead moreThe researchers behind the new maps built onprevious workbut employed a deliberately conservative approach in order to shine a spotlight on those places with the highest potential and the fewest problems.They focused only on dense, closed-canopy forests and excluded areas that had suffered recent wildfires. The result was a map showing 195 million hectares of reforestation opportunity, an area equivalent to the size ofMexicobut up to 90% smaller than previous maps. They provided further options that, for example, avoid the risk of social conflict with forest peoples, which reduced the potential CO2 removal to 1.5bn tonnes a year.Reforestation opportunity maps are crucial because regrowing trees is the largest and cheapest option for taking CO2 out of the atmosphere, but tree initiatives need to focus on the most suitable areas to maximise their impact.“Reforestation is not a substitute for cutting fossil fuel emissions, but even if we were to drive down emissions tomorrow, we still need to remove excess CO2 from the atmosphere,” said Dr Susan Cook-Patton, at The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and a senior author of the new study,published in the journal Nature Communications. “Many, many years of evolution have gone into trees figuring out how to suck CO2 from the atmosphere and lock it into carbon stores, so it’s ready to scale now.”“As the number of climate-fuelled disasters stack up worldwide, it’s increasingly obvious that we can’t waste time on well-meaning but hazily-understood interventions,” she said. “We must fast-track our focus toward the places with greatest benefits for people and nature and the fewest downsides, the places most likely to be win-win. This study will help leaders and investors do just that.”Maps showing best opportunities for global reforestationProf Simon Lewis, at University College London and not part of the study team, said: “There have been a series of well-known studies of global reforestation potential that have come up with wildly high numbers. This new study is the antidote to such hyperbole. New forests in the lowest risk areas globally would remove about 5% of humans’ CO2 emissions each year – important, but not a silver bullet.”The options the scientists created beyond their 195mHa base map prioritised three broad criteria: avoiding social conflicts, improving biodiversity and water quality, and highlighting places where governments already had reforestation goals, making action more politically possible.“There’s always a set of values or motivations that goes into the way you produce the map, and the answer that you get,” said Kurt Fesenmyer, also at TNC and lead author of the new analysis. The area of land that met every criteria was small – 15mHa – so the researchers hope governments and NGOs will use theirinteractive mapsto highlight the most suitable solutions in their own countries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

These regions were particularly focused in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia, as well asBrazil, which is hosting the UN’s Cop30 climate summit in November.Lewis said the approach taken in the new study made sense: “Who wants to see the natural grasslands like the Serengeti covered in trees and not lions, elephants and other wildlife? And planting trees in places that burn isn’t going to store carbon long-term, and so of course these areas should be excluded.”However, he added: “The most conservative map removes potential forest restoration across almost all of Africa and Southeast Asia, due to fears of [land rights] conflict. This risks perpetuating poverty, if investments in nature avoid poor countries with limited governance. Plans to invest in nature to improve local livelihoods and also benefit the climate and biodiversity should be seized, as these often go hand-in-hand.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisTrees and forestsBrazilAmericasCanadaGlobal researchMexiconewsShareReuse this content"

The answer is: David Serkin, the name of the cancer survivor from Alberta who won three separate lottery jackpots between August and May to accumulate about $2.5m in prize money.According to officials, those lucky tickets marked the second, third and fourth times Serkin had won a lottery in his life, a feat that he had vanishingly small chances of pulling off and gained notice on corners of the internet dedicated to charming news stories.“I know the odds are astronomical, [and] I don’t think it’ll happen again,” Serkin said in apress bulletinissued recently by the Western Canada Lottery Corporation (WCLC). “But I still like buying tickets.”Serkin won draws of $500,000 on 20 August, $1m on 16 November and $1m on 3 May, the last of those coming from a ticket that he bought at a gasoline station in his home town of Lethbridge. To give an idea of the odds he faced, he had a 1 in about 33.3m chance of winning the first of those jackpots, the WCLC’s bulletin said.The media outlet NOW Torontoaddedthat Serkin had won another $250,000 lottery jackpot more than a decade before his newer streak of good fortune.At least part of his lottery success seems to involve consistently playing the odds. He told officials he has been playing the lottery since 1982 – but he maintained that is because he simply enjoys the ritual of buying his tickets and then checking them.“You check your ticket and if you win – you’re happy,” Serkin said. “If you don’t, you can always try again.“I’m a cancer survivor and I’m retired, so I am just grateful for all of it.”Serkin said he bought his latest triumphant ticket on a whim while buying gasoline, figuring, “What do I have to lose?”He said his friends’ reacted by saying “not again?!” when he took them out for coffee and informed them he had hit the jackpot once more.As Serkin put it, his wife was equally incredulous – and, if history was any indication, a memorable vacation was in store for her.“I took my wife to Hawaii with the last win, and we had a great time,” Serkin said to officials. “Now, we’re going to Newfoundland.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

China also targeted the aerospace and defense industries by limiting 15 US entities with ties to the industry from receiving dual-use goods.“The United States is already on the back foot when it comes to manufacturing these defense technologies,” Baskaransaid in an interviewpublished by CSIS. “China is rapidly expanding its munitions production and acquiring advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States. While China is preparing with a wartime mindset, the United States continues to operate under peacetime conditions.”Trump has amassed a team of foreign policy China hawks, including a number who have warned that the US should focus more on the pacing threat posed by China over the coming decades instead of current conflicts in Ukraine or the Middle East.“Even before the latest restrictions, the US defense industrial base struggled with limited capacity and lacked the ability to scale up production to meet defense technology demands,” she continued. “Further bans on critical minerals inputs will only widen the gap, enabling China to strengthen its military capabilities more quickly than the United States.”China and the US had agreed last month in Geneva to pause the implementation of sky-high tariffs that would have delivered a severe economic blow to manufacturers and consumers in the US, as well as exporters in China.But China maintained export licenses on rare-earth metals used by both defense producers and carmakers that threatened to upend global supply chains and imperil production in the US.In particular, China has a stranglehold on the production and export of samarium, a magnet used in combination with cobalt to provide highly durable magnets used to withstand the intense temperatures in military-grade tech. China produces the entire world’s supply of the rare-earth metal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pentagon planners and other officials in the administration of Joe Biden, regularly squared off over whether foreign weapons deliveries expose a US vulnerability in case it faced off with a major military power.In order to break the deadlock, secretary of stateMarco Rubioalso abruptly announced plans to cancel hundreds of thousands of visas for Chinese students in the US. While publicly that was said as a plan to root out Chinese spies in US higher education,Axios reportedthat the visa ban was also motivated by China’s obstinance on resuming rare earths exports.The breakthrough comes as Trump is planning to displayUS militaryprowess at a parade in Washington DC this weekend that has been seen as an attempt to flex American muscle and reinforce the US president’s bonafides as a supporter of the military.Trump in 2019 ordered the Pentagon to find new sources of procuring rare earth minerals, in particular samarium, because the US did not have the capacity to produce them domestically. The initiative was “essential to the national defense”, he said then.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeTrump tariffsTrump administrationChinaDonald TrumpUS politicsAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

However, a White House official said it merely reflected Trump’s worldwide 10% baseline “reciprocal” tariff on imports, the 20% fentanyl trafficking levy and a 25% pre-existing tariff on China.Writing on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump said: “Our deal with China is done, subject to final approval with president Xi and me … We are getting a total of 55% tariffs, China is getting 10%. Relationship is excellent!”After two days of negotiations in London, US and Chinese officials agreed on a framework to get their trade truce back on track and remove China’s export restrictions on the rare earth imports essential to US industries including automotive, electronics and defence, while offering little resolution to wider trade differences.Trump added in his post that in the deal, “full magnets, and any necessary rare earths, will be supplied, upfront, by China. Likewise, we will provide to China what was agreed to, including Chinese students using our colleges and universities (which has always been good with me!)”The US secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick, told reporters the London “framework” put “meat on the bones” of an agreement reached last month in Geneva to ease retaliatory tariffs that had reached crushing triple-digit levelsIt would, he said, allow them to “implement” the Geneva pact but was subject to the approval of Trump and Xi.The Geneva deal had faltered over China’s curbs on critical minerals exports, prompting the Trump administration to respond with export controls of their own preventing shipments of semiconductor design software, aircraft and other goods to China.Full details of the agreement were not immediately released and Trump has previouslycancelled trade agreementshe has brokered with major trading partners, including Mexico and Canada.The London deal came as the US car industry drew close to halting production because China had choked off the supply of magnets used in windshields and doors. China has a stranglehold on the global market of rare earths and magnets and introduced curbs in April after Trump’s decision to launch a trade war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The consumer price index (CPI) – which measures the cost of a basket of goods and services – rose to an annual rate of 2.4% in May, up from 2.3% in April.Economists have been expecting Trump’s trade wars to increase US inflation, which remains above the 2% per year rate preferred by the Federal Reserve. Companies including Walmart, Best Buy, Ford and Procter & Gamble have all warned that the levies will be passed on to consumers.The president has been at loggerheads with the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, urging the head of the US central bank to lower interest rates. Trump once again called on the Fed to cut rates at its next meeting, set for 17 and 18 June.“CPI JUST OUT. GREAT NUMBERS! FED SHOULD LOWER ONE FULL POINT. WOULD PAY MUCH LESS INTEREST ON DEBT COMING DUE. SO IMPORTANT!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.But economists expect the Fed to keep rate cuts on hold amid the uncertainty over trade policy. “We expect the underlying strength in the economy and uncertainty over the policy outlook to keep the Fed in ‘wait-and-see’ mode next week,” Bradley Saunders, North America economist for CapitalEconomics, wrote in a note to investors.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsChinaEconomicsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Decades later, onlyTaiwanstill stands its ground, “fending off the persistent aggravation”.The game asks players if Taiwan can stay safe by avoiding provocative action, or if it should “refrain from repeating the same mistakes of the last 30 years which allowed the communists to grow into the behemoth today”.In player descriptions, the game describes the communists as “heavy-handed, reckless and inept” and accused of “widespread corruption, embezzlement, exploitation, slaughter and defilement”.On their Facebook page, the developers – known as ESC Taiwan or Taiwan Overseas Strategic Communication Working Group (ESC) – said the attention had boosted downloads. On Wednesday it said the game had topped the Hong Kong App Store’s downloads chart on Tuesday night, before being taken down in the morning.“We encourage users to change the country or region of their Apple ID in order to successfully download the game.”The developers vowed not to actively filter or review any words or phrases in the game – a nod to recent controversies overcensorship in Chinese-made or China-related games.It is unclear where ESC Taiwan is based.The police warning over the game forms part of an ongoing crackdown on pro-democracy opposition in Hong Kong, where CCP control has steadily tightened around the once semi-autonomous city. In 2020 Beijing imposed thenational security law on Hong Kong, with the city government’s blessing, outlawing a broad range of dissenting behaviours as criminal.Critics have accused authorities of weaponising the law to target opposition voices, including activists, politicians, labour unions, journalists and media outlets, as well as children’s books and bookshops.Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsHong KongMobile gamesAsia PacificTibetGamesUyghursChinanewsShareReuse this content"

In thousands of social media videos, the aquatic mammals wriggle through the outstretched hands of adoring customers who reward their attention with food.But the booming demand has raised major concerns among conservationists, witha studypublished in the journal Conservation Science and Practice linking the small-clawed otters in animal cafes in Japanese cities with wild populations in poaching hotspots in Thailand.Researchers compared the DNA profiles of 81 otters from zoos and animal cafes or seized by customs with genetic data from wild populations in Malaysia, Singapore andThailand. They found the overwhelming majority of captive otters matched with two poaching hotspots in southern Thailand, on the Gulf of Thailand coastline and near the border with Malaysia.The Asian small-clawed otter,classified as vulnerableto extinction on the IUCN red list, is the otter species of choice and has become a popular pet, even though itscommercial trade was bannedinternationally in 2019.View image in fullscreenIn the wild, otters have a key role in maintaining freshwater and mangrove swamps in Asia, hunting creatures such as crabs and molluscs.Photograph: imageBroker.com/Alamy“In recent decades, the otter has become very popular in Japan because of the cafes. I feel anxiety about the situation because the otters are decreasing in their own territories. We wanted to see where they were coming from,” said Mayako Fujihara, associate professor at theWildlifeResearch Centre of Kyoto University and study co-author.“We cannot confirm that the otters came through the illegal trade but we have shown that their DNA is the same as those from areas in Thailand that are illegal trade hotspots.“Many cafe owners do not understand the situation. Some believe they are helping otter conservation by breeding them and showing them to people.”While not definitive proof, researchers fromJapan, Thailand and France said their findings were strongly suggestive of links to the wild trade. Some of the otters found in Japan’s pet cafes could also have been bred in captivity from animals captured and imported before the 2019 ban.“Before the study, we had this strong feeling that most of them were smuggled,” said Dr Marie Sigaud, from the National History Museum in France. “These otters are in Appendix 1 in Cites [Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora], the most highly protected category, like elephant ivory. Our big question to answer was where they are coming from. The results strongly suggest that at least some of those otters are coming directly from the illegal trade.”‘People buy a lion and can’t handle it’: inside the farms breeding cubs for TikTok and Instagram likesRead moreIn the wild, the otters have a key role in maintaining freshwater and mangrove swamps in Asia, hunting creatures such as crabs and molluscs. They form monogamous pairs for life and are known for their dextrous, highly sensitive claws for digging. Conservationists worry that the pet trade will see their role in ecosystems disappear – exacerbating the impact of habitat loss and pollution.Despite recent efforts, smuggling of the otters remains rampant, with the animals prized for their cuteness. The scale of the trade in small-clawed otters was first unveiled in 2018 in ajoint studyby the IUCN otter specialist group and Traffic, an NGO specialising in the global trade in wild animals and plants. It found more than 500 adverts for the creatures between January and April 2017, with a huge demand for young otters less than a year old. It is believed to have grown since then.“You cannot have an otter as a pet in most European countries but it is a very popular pet in Asia and Japan. There are popular YouTube channels from people that have otters as pets and there are lots of follows. It’s a cute species, even though it’s very hard to look after,” Sigaud said.Kanitha Krishnasamy, Traffic’s director in south-east Asia, was sceptical that an industry breeding the animals in captivity would help wild populations.View image in fullscreenCustomers play with small-clawed otters in a booth at a cafe in Tokyo, March 2019.Photograph: Noriko Hayashi/New York Times/Redux/eyevine“Otters have long been sought after for illegal trade,” she said. “There are many longstanding examples that highlight the pitfalls and complications in regulating and controlling breeding for trade, with links to laundering of illegally caught wild specimens into the legal trade chain. Any move to introduce commercial captive breeding is extremely risky.”The researchers also urged people to think twice before visiting the cafes or having the animals as pets, as they can sometimes become aggressive. In social media posts, they often show signs of stress and are regularly grossly overweight, sometimes vomiting up food or gnawing away at their own tails.Fujihara said: “I don’t think it is a good idea for people to go to the cafes. Most of the people go because they love animals. But people should understand that the businesses may be involved in the illegal trade.”.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsIllegal wildlife tradeThe age of extinctionJapanThailandConservationMammalsAnimalsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

China’s exports to the US plunged 35% year on year in May.The choked global supply of rare earths, which China controls, was already threatening to halt production in the automotive sector this summer on both sides of the Atlantic, with permanent magnets used in everything from windscreen wipers to doors.China’s delegation was headed up by the vice-premier He Lifeng – a seasoned negotiator at the top of the Chinese government who had also led talks in Geneva.Lutnick told reporters that Tuesday’s framework put “meat on the bones” of the Geneva deal. Its implementation had faltered over China’s curbs on critical mineral exports. The deal also would remove some US export restrictions that were recently put in place, Lutnick said.“We have reached a framework to implement the Geneva consensus and the call between the two presidents,” Lutnick said. “The idea is we’re going to go back and speak to President Trump and make sure he approves it. They’re going to go back and speak to President Xi and make sure he approves it, and if that is approved, we will then implement the framework.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It gives US soldiers access to Danish airbases in three Danish cities – Karup, Skrydstrup and Aalborg – and grants American soldiers and military police powers over Danish civilians at these locations and outside them.Alarm over defence agreement giving US ‘unhindered access’ to Danish airbasesRead moreIf US soldiers were to commit a crime in Denmark, they would be punished under the US, not Danish, legal system in the first instance. The US will also be able to carry out military activities in and from Denmark – including stationing personnel, storing military material and equipment, maintenance, training and exercise activities.Despite heightened tensions between the US and Denmark amid Donald Trump’s unprecedented push to acquire Greenland – a strategically vital part of the Danish kingdom – andreports US intelligence agencies were ordered to increase espionage in the territory, a broad majority of the Danish parliament (Folketinget) voted in support of adopting the agreement. A total of 94 MPs voted for the bill and 11 against.Just before the vote, the leader of the Unity List party, Pelle Dragsted, said the agreement was “harmful to the country”.“It is an agreement that means that we will have areas in Denmark that are under American jurisdiction. Where Danish authorities cannot exercise control. And where mistreatment of prisoners can occur,” he said. “It is a gigantic failure towards the Danish population.”The agreement was signed under the Biden administration in December 2023. Since Trump’s return to office, relations between Copenhagen and Washington DC have altered dramatically.Some politicians believe the new agreement could surrender Danish sovereignty and even be a violation of the Danish constitution. The Danish government has said this is not the case.The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said the situation between the two countries made it even more necessary to maintain close ties. “The problem is not too much involvement from the US inEurope. On the contrary, the risk is that the US will withdraw and move troops away or stop donations to Ukraine,” she said.At a consultation on Tuesday, the Danish justice minister, Peter Hummelgaard, said Danish authorities would have “primary safety responsibility both on and off the facilities covered by the agreement”.The Danish Institute for Human Rights has said the bill risks giving US soldiers the right to stop demonstrations outside their bases and would prevent Denmark from prosecuting them if they used excessive force.Peter Vedel Kessing, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for Human Rights,told the Guardianin May: “If the bill is passed and American soldiers carry out illegal acts in Denmark, it will be beyond Danish control and outside the reach of the Danish legal system to prosecute such actions.”Explore more on these topicsDenmarkEuropeDonald TrumpJoe BidennewsShareReuse this content"

British military facilities in Gibraltar will remain operationally autonomous.However, it will apply Schengen rules to Britons arriving in Gibraltar who are not resident there. This means they could be turned away at the border if they have already spent 90 days in the Schengen zone over a 180-day period.David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, said the deal was “a practical solution after years of uncertainty” and that the UK’s commitment to Gibraltar “remains as solid as the Rock itself”.Will the UK ‘give up’ Gibraltar next? In Spain, we’re more worried about Brexit’s absurdities | María RamírezRead moreJosé Manuel Albares, the Spanish foreign affairs minister, and Fabian Picardo, the chief minister of Gibraltar, hailed it as a “historic agreement” in posts on Bluesky and X.Lammy, Picardo and Albares unveiled the deal in Brussels on Wednesday afternoonafter talks by ministers from Britain and Gibraltar earlier in the day.Talks about the borderhave been held on and offsinceBritain exited the European Union in 2020, which left Gibraltar outside the EU customs union and without guaranteed freedom of movement.An estimated 15,000 people cross the land border every day, including thousands of workers who live inSpainbut work in Gibraltar.At present, Gibraltar residents can cross using residence cards without having their passports stamped, and Spanish citizens can cross using a government ID card. The deal aims to prevent a hard border from being imposed under new EU rules.The agreement establishes a system where British and Spanish border officers will carry out passport checks at Gibraltar’s port and airport. This will mirror the system in place for Eurostar travellers at St Pancras station in London, where travellers go through British and French passport control before boarding trains to the continent.Spanish border police, based at Gibraltar’s port and airport, could refuse access to a UK citizen who has broken Schengen rules, such as staying longer than 90 days during a 180-day period without a visa. This may prove unpopular with rightwing opposition parties in the UK.At a press conference in Brussels on Wednesday afternoon, Albares called the agreement a new beginning in relations between Spain and the UK that brought down “the last wall” on the continent.“With this agreement, the barrier will disappear. That’s the last wall on continentalEurope, and we will guarantee free movement of persons and goods. Gibraltar will be linked to the Schengen area, and Spain will control entry and exit,” he said.Keir Starmer spoke with Picardo to congratulate him, a spokesperson for the prime minister said.They added: “He thanked him for his years of hard work, commitment and leadership to reach an agreement, adding that it was fantastic to see that it had been profusely welcomed by all sides.Gibraltar’s government and FA criticise Spain players’ chants at Euro 2024 partyRead more“Both agreed that this would unlock a secure future for the people and businesses of Gibraltar, allowing them to plan for the long-term while protecting British sovereignty.”The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, congratulated Starmer, as “his government had succeeded where others had failed”.No 10 added: “Both leaders also agreed that this development unlocks huge opportunity to advance the bilateral relationship between the UK and Spain, on behalf of the British and Spanish people.”Priti Patel, the UK’s shadow foreign secretary, said: “Gibraltar is British, and given Labour’s record of surrendering our territory and paying for the privilege, we will be reviewing carefully all the details of any agreement that is reached.”Gibraltar has made concessions on taxation, including on tobacco. Spain has been calling for the territory to stop exempting tobacco from VATamid EU concerns about smuggling.Maroš Šefčovič, the EU commissioner in charge of UK relations, told reporters that the agreement was a “truly historic milestone for theEuropean Union, including Spain, as well as for the United Kingdom”.Brokered less than one month after the EU-UK summit in London last month, Šefčovič said the latest deal reinforced “a new chapter in our [EU-UK] relationship”, adding that there was “no alternative given today’s realities and challenges”.Negotiators will now focus on finalising the legal text to prepare it for ratification.Gibraltar is aBritish overseas territoryon the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula. It has been ruled by Britain since 1713 but is self-governing in all areas except defence and foreign policy.Spainclaims sovereignty over the territory, but Gibraltar’s 1969 constitution states there can be no transfer of sovereignty to Spain against the wishes of locals. In a 2002 referendum, 99% of people in Gibraltar rejected a proposal to share sovereignty with Spain.Explore more on these topicsGibraltarForeign policyBrexitSpainEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He said that if the UK was not prepared to increase defence budgets to the 3.5% figure, “you had better learn to speak Russian”.Earlier on Wednesday, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, reiterated commitments given in February by Starmer to increase defence spending to 2.6% of GDP by April 2027. That amounts to a cash total of £71bn, an increase of £10.7bn from the expected £60.3bn in 2024/5.Treasury documents also repeated there was “an ambition to reach 3% in the next parliament as economic and fiscal conditions allow”. Senior defence insiders argued that restating the existing position was a misstep and failed to acknowledge that Nato was expected to agree further increases in spending in the next fortnight.A week ago, the UK released a “Nato first” defence review based on the idea that spending would rise to 2.5% by 2027 and 3% in the next parliament, but one insider suggested there could have been more money for the review team to allocate had the exercise had been delayed several months.“The sequencing of the defence review with the Nato summit has not been well thought out,” one defence source argued. An extra 1 percentage point of GDP would amount to about £30bn, though the exact figure would depend on the size of the UK economy at the time.A second source said last-minute consideration had been given to delaying the defence review until the autumn but it was felt this was in breach of commitments given by defence secretary, John Healey, to publish the document in the spring.Downing Street pointed to a readout of Starmer’s meeting with Rutte that it released on Monday. That said the two men had agreed that Nato allies “still needed to go further and faster to ensure stability and security and reinforce defence industries for the future”, implying the UK acknowledged the case for extra spending.It said “the leaders also discussed future funding proposals for Nato and underscored the importance of going further to step up on national resilience and protect critical national infrastructure,” though the statement did not refer to any specific spending figures.Nato’s new defence plan, designed to deter Russia from attacking its eastern flank, envisages a fivefold increase in air and missile defence, and allies buying thousands more tanks and armoured vehicles, millions more artillery shells and a doubling of logistics, supply, transportation and medical support.Last week, defence insiders predicted that the UK wouldeventually be forced into agreeingto an increase in military spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2035, although the exact date remains a subject of negotiation. But the discussions appear to be continuing until close to the start of the summit on 24 June.Spain is the only Nato member that has publicly declared it is not prepared to meet the proposed 3.5% commitment itself. But last week, Margarita Robles, the country’s defence minister, said Madrid would not veto an alliance-wide decision to increase the spending target either. Nato traditionally makes decisions by consensus.Starmer is due to speak again to Rutte at the G7 summit in Canada at the weekend.Separately, the US announced it had conducted a quick review of its participation in the joint Aukus nuclear-powered submarine project with Australia and the UK that was agreed under the Biden administration. A US withdrawal could put the future of the project in doubt, and comes at a time when Washington is pressing Canberra to increase defence spending to 3.5% of GDP.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyNatoMark RutteKeir StarmerMilitaryEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He told his parents in a suicide note that he had acted of his “own free will”.The young man, who had left the school two years ago without completing his studies, had apologised to his parents and older siblings but had not disclosed a motive for his attack, officials said.The shooting – the worst in Austria’s postwar history – took place in 17 minutes on Tuesday morning, just after the start of the third lesson of the day. Many children were sitting exams at the time. Eyewitnesses described how the perpetrator had fired through classroom doors using a shotgun, subsequently shooting at victims with a pistol. Pupils were told by teachers to lie flat on the floor and to barricade themselves in rooms, using chairs to block the doors.Police arrived at the scene at 10.06am after receiving a call from a woman living close to the school at 10am, who had heard shots.View image in fullscreenAustria has entered a three-day period of national mourning.Photograph: Alex Halada/AFP/Getty ImagesThe killer’s mother had reportedly alerted police 24 minutes after receiving what has been described as a farewell video from her son. But by the time she had seen it, he was already carrying out the attack.Of the nine people shot dead at the school, six were female and three were male. The pupils were Austrian citizens, aged between 14 and 17, and one Polish citizen. The eldest, a 59-year-old female teacher, died from her injuries on Tuesday evening.The killer, described in local media as a loner with apparently no social media presence and who had only one friend, killed himself in the school building. His body was discovered by armed police in a toilet cubicle.According to police, the alleged attacker had been legally in possession of the shotgun and Glock pistol. He had also reportedly been deemed fit to own the weapons, according to a standard psychological test.The killings have sparked a heated debate about weapon possession in Austria, which is among the most heavily weaponised countries inEuropeand where most 18-year-olds have easy access to buying guns. Officially, its 9 million citizens own more than 1m weapons, although experts have said the real figure is probably much higher.The homemade pipe bomb, discovered by police on Tuesday evening in the flat where Arthur A lived with his mother, was found to be ineffectual. But police on Wednesday said they believed the youth had planned to detonate the bomb at the school.View image in fullscreenA minute’s silence was observed across Austria on Wednesday morning in tribute to the victims of the shooting.Photograph: Matej Povse/Getty ImagesAcross the country, Austrians held a minute’s silence in tribute to the victims on Wednesday morning, at the start of three days of national mourning. Public transport came to a halt, the state broadcaster, ORF, paused its TV and radio programming, and church bells sounded in mourning, while flags were flown at half mast on public buildings.Outside the BORG Dreierschützengasse high school, current and former pupils, as well as other Graz residents, were hugging, sobbing and leaning on each other for support as they arrived to place candles and flowers. Some wove the stems through the mesh of the fence.Paul Nitsche, a priest who is also a teacher at the school, had returned for the one minute’s silence and to pay tribute to his colleague and pupils who had lost their lives.He described hearing the first shots when he was working in an empty classroom while his 8th-year pupils sat their exams in a nearby room. After initially dismissing the noises, he decided to run.“Suddenly the silence was broken by the sound of bullets. At first I thought it was fireworks or something because anything else was out of the question. Then, I thought, maybe it’s an attack. I decided to run,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe mayor and vice-mayor of Graz lay flowers to pay their respect at a central square in the south-eastern city.Photograph: Erwin Scheriau/APA/AFP/Getty Images“I went out and across the corridor, and down the stairs and that’s when I saw the attacker very briefly, with his weapon, trying to shoot through the lock of a classroom door – five metres away from me. I was scared. I just kept running downstairs. When I saw a female pupil lying on the floor and a female teacher then I knew it was true.”Sharon, a social worker and mother of a 14-year-old boy who survived the attack, wiped away tears as she described receiving a call from him yesterday morning while she was driving. “He said to me: ‘Mum, I’m OK, you don’t need to worry about me.’ It was the first I’d heard of the incident,” she said, paying tribute to a teacher who had told her son and his classmates to jam the classroom door with chairs.Sharon said she had driven to a nearby hall where pupils had been brought to safety.“We were mainly mothers in the room,” she said. “I knew my son was OK, but others didn’t. Some people were screaming when they knew their children had been hit. You can’t imagine the emotional turmoil. My son lost one of his best friends, and knows at least two of those who died,” she said. “We feel hollow and devastated.”Laura, 19, who lives next to the school and is in the middle of her exams, came to place a candle outside the school, where a close friend is a pupil. “They’re going to have to rethink the security of schools, like introducing metal detectors, because no one is going to want to go to school after this,” she said.View image in fullscreenA memorial in front BORG Dreierschützengasse high school, where the shooting took place on Tuesday morning.Photograph: Alex Halada/AFP/Getty ImagesLaura said she had known of the attacker, who had been in the same class as a friend for a year before leaving without taking exams. The friend could not recall him being bullied, as has been cited in some local media articles as a potential motive.People in Graz had queued into the night to donate blood that could be used to treat 11 wounded people, aged 15 to 26, eight of whom were said by authorities to be Austrian, two Romanian, and one Iranian. On Wednesday, two of the injured remained in intensive care, although all were said to be in a stable condition. One who had been shot in the face was undergoing a second emergency operation, authorities said.Among the quiet residential community in Kalsdorf, the southern Graz district where Arthur A lived with his mother, neighbours spoke of their shock at finding out that he had lived among them.Thomas Gasser, 38, a supermarket manager who lived directly opposite Arthur A, had been sitting on his garden terrace when armed police arrived at about 11.30am on Tuesday to raid the home he shared with his mother.“It was eerie. They quietly crept up on the house, around 15 to 20 officers, fully clad with weapons. Nothing, literally nothing happens in this neighbourhood. The idea that this man with murderous intentions and a pipe bomb was living opposite us is hard to fathom, and very unsettling,” he said.Arthur A, he said, “had lived here for five years, but was very reserved. He always had his headphones in, dressed in dark clothes and wore a cap pulled down over his eyes”.Walking past the flat where the gunman lived, Natalia Chalakova, 19, originally from Bulgaria, expressed her shock that the attacker was from the neighbourhood. “No one could stop talking about it when we met at school this morning for our exams, and no one could really concentrate,” she said. “The most upset of any kind that usually happens here are disputes on the playground with kids fighting over their toys. To have a mass murderer in our midst – this is an American story, not an Austrian one.”Explore more on these topicsAustriaEuropeChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

An area twice the size of Luxembourg has been consumed by flames in an average recent year, killing people, destroying homes and wildlife and sending megatonnes of planet-heating emissions into the air.TheEuropean court of auditorspraised the decision to devote more money to preventing fires but said European-funded projects were not always spent where they could make the biggest difference. In Greece, authorities were using a map drawn up in 1980 to assess the risk of forest fires. In Portugal, one area selected as a priority for funds contained a zone that was underwater due to a recently built dam.The auditors raised the concerns against the backdrop of a sharp increase in EU funds to prevent and respond to forest fires. EU funding has increased through the €650bnCovid recovery fund, launched in 2020 with the aim of helping EU member states recover from the pandemic-induced crisis by strengthening environmental policies and their technological base.Fires drove record loss of world’s forests last year, ‘frightening’ data showsRead moreGreece, for example, is on course to receive €837m of recovery funds between 2020 and 2026 to combat forest fires, having benefited from €49m in EU funds during the previous seven-year budget period. Spain and to a lesser extent Portugal have also seen a sharp uplift in EU funds dedicated to forest fires.The €650bn recovery and resilience fund, almost entirely funded by borrowing on markets, has already been criticised by auditors aslacking transparency and accountability.The latest report highlights how governments have felt pressure to spend money quickly, leading to questionable decisions. Portugal’s rural fire management agency, for instance, was not involved in decisions on how to spend Covid recovery funds worth €615m over seven years to combat forest fires. A Portuguese authority due to receive fire engines could not meet a 48-hour deadline from Lisbon to outline its needs, and ultimately key decisions on the fleet of 55 vehicles were made by national officials.EU funds can be spent on activities to prevent or respond quickly to fires, such as cutting back vegetation, or building roads to ensure firefighting trucks quickly reach forested areas. The temporary nature of the Covid recovery funds, which expire in 2026, also raised questions about future funding. Vegetation, for example, needs to be cut back every three to four years to maintain firebreaks.Nikolaos Milionis, the ECA member in charge of the inquiry, said: “We found that on a positive note more human money is being spent on prevention of fires. However, the way the European-funded projects are selected means the money does not always go where it could make the biggest difference.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

On TuesdayIsraeli troops killed 17 Palestiniansaround GHF sites.The bodies of two Israeli hostages were recovered from Gaza by the army and the internal security service, Shin Bet. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, issued a statement naming one of the dead hostages as Yair Yaakov, a 59-year-old father of three who was abducted and killed byHamasin its 7 October 2023 attack in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and triggered the conflict. Netanyahu said the second hostage whose remains were recovered, could not yet be named.There are thought to be 53 Israelis hostages still in Gaza, but most are believed to be dead.The Gaza health authorities said on Wednesday the Palestinian death toll over the 20 months of conflict had passed 55,000. The health ministry was part of the Hamas government but is staffed by medical professionals and its statistics are regarded as reliable by the UN and other global organisations.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In recent days, more and more of the fatalities have been associated with GHF food distribution. On Wednesday, a New York-based law group, the Center for Constitutional Rights, warned the GHF of its “potential legal liability for complicity in Israel’s war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide against Palestinians”.“As Palestinians now face mass starvation, Israel has teamed up with GHF to make accessing food not only dangerous and potentially deadly but also a tool of forced displacement,” its senior staff attorney, Katherine Gallagher, said. “If GHF continues its militarised aid operations, it must be prepared to face the legal consequences, whether in the United States or beyond.”The Israeli government and armed forces are now under scrutiny by the international court of justice on allegations of genocide, in part because of the alleged use of food as a weapon against the occupied territory’s 2.2 million people.Humanitarian experts had previously warned that the GHF scheme or distributing food from a restricted number of heavily militarised siteswould be highly dangerous for people seeking food, forcing them to cross combat zones.The organisation’s first executive director, Jake Wood,resigned last month, saying its plan ran counter to “humanitarian principles”.Last week, a US consulting firm, Boston Consulting Group which had helped set up the GHF, severed ties with the organisation. Johnnie Moore, an evangelical leader and religious adviser to Donald Trump, with a record of outspoken support for Israel and minimal experience of humanitarian work, wasappointed the new chair of the GHF.The Israel Defense Forces said troops had fired “warning shots” overnight towards a group it said posed a threat to them. “This is despite warnings that the area is an active combat zone. The IDF is aware of reports regarding individuals injured; the details are under review,” it said.The GHF told the Reuters news agency it was unaware of Wednesday’s incidents but added that it was working closely with Israeli authorities to ensure safe passage routes are maintained, and that it was essential for Palestinians to closely follow instructions.“Ultimately, the solution is more aid, which will create more certainty and less urgency among the population,” it said.“There is not yet enough food to feed everyone in need in Gaza. Our current focus is to feed as many people as is safely possible within the constraints of a highly volatile environment.”In a social media post, Moore said he had visited a GHF packing and distribution centre in Israel and claimed the organisation provided 2.5 million meals on Wednesday. That would bring the total to 16 million meals distributed in Gaza since it started operations on 27 May.The GHF late on Wednesday accused Hamas of killing at least five people in an attack on a bus carrying two dozen Palestinians working with the aid organization to one of its distribution sites.“We will continue our mission to provide critical aid to the people of Gaza,” it said in a statement.‘We did nothing wrong’: Greta Thunberg accuses Israel of kidnapping yacht crewRead moreAlso on Wednesday, an Israeli civil rights group, Adalah, said that one of an international group of activistsdetained by Israel on a ship in the eastern Mediterranean, was being held in solitary confinement.In a statement it said that a Brazilian protester, Tiago Ávila, was being held in isolation in Ayalon prison “due to his ongoing hunger and thirst strike, which he began two days ago”.Another activist detained on the Madleen protest ship, a French-Palestinian member of the European parliament, Rima Hassan, was temporarily held in solitary confinement, in Neve Tirza prison after writing “Free Palestine” on a cell wall.“She was moved to a small, windowless cell with extremely poor hygienic conditions and has been denied access to the prison yard,” Adalah said. It added that Hassan had been moved out of isolation on Wednesday.

The embassy already had been on limited staffing, and the order will not affect a large number of personnel.Iran on brink of rejecting US proposal on nuclear programmeRead moreThe US is also authorizing the departure of non-essential personnel and family members from Bahrain and Kuwait.Defense secretary Pete Hegseth “has authorized the voluntary departure of military dependents from locations” across the region, US Central Command said in a statement. The command “is monitoring the developing tension in the Middle East”.The partial evacuations come at a moment of heightened tensions in a region already aflame after 18 months of war in Gaza that has raised fears of a wider conflagration pitting the US and Israel againstIranand its allies.Earlier on Wednesday Britain’s maritime agency warned that increased tensions in the Middle East may lead to an escalation in military activity that could impact shipping in critical waterways. It advised vessels to use caution while travelling through the Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the Straits of Hormuz, which all border Iran.Britain’s Foreign Office said it was monitoring the situation and will keep its embassy in Iraq under constant review after the US moves.Tensions in the region have risen further in recent days asnuclear talks between the US and Iran appear to have hit an impasse.On Wednesday, Iran’s defence minister, Aziz Nasirzadeh, responded to US threats of military action if the talks fail, saying: “All its bases are within our reach, we have access to them, and without hesitation we will target all of them in the host countries.“God willing, things won’t reach that point, and the talks will succeed,” Nasirzadeh said, adding that the US side “will suffer more losses” if it came to conflict.Iran and the US have been locked in a diplomatic standoff over Iran’s uranium enrichment, with Tehran defending it as a “non-negotiable” right and Washington calling it as a “red line”.The US has confirmed that special envoy Steve Witkoff will meet Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Oman on Sunday and discuss the Iranian response to a recent US proposal. A senior Iranian official told Reuters that a military threat has always been part of the United States’ negotiation tactics with Iran.Trump had previously expressed optimism about the talks, saying during a Gulf tour last month that Washington was “getting close” to securing a deal.But in an interview published on Wednesday, Trump said he was “less confident” the US and Iran could reach a deal, in response to a question about whether he believed he could stop Tehran enriching uranium.Speaking to the New York Post’s podcast Pod Force One, which was recorded on Monday, Trump said he was losing hope a deal could be reached. “I don’t know. I did think so, and I’m getting more and more – less confident about it. They seem to be delaying and I think that’s a shame. I am less confident now than I would have been a couple of months ago,” he said.“Something happened to them but I am much less confident of a deal being made … Maybe they don’t wanna make a deal, what can I say? And maybe they do. There is nothing final.”Trump maintained that Washington would not allow Tehran to obtain nuclear weapons, saying “it would be nicer to do it without warfare, without people dying”.On Wednesday evening he told reporters US personnel were being moved from a potentially “dangerous” Middle East amid tensions with Iran, reiterating that Tehran “can’t have a nuclear weapon”.The top US military officer for the Middle East, Gen Erik Kurilla, had been scheduled to testify before the Senate armed services committee on Thursday, but that testimony has now been postponed, according to the committee’s website. The Pentagon did not have an immediate comment on why Kurilla’s testimony was postponed.Explore more on these topicsIraqUS foreign policyIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The hostages suffer and die. Soldiers are sent for nothing. And all the killing in Gaza, everything is completely unnecessary.”Gaza doctor and son evacuated after husband and nine children killed in Israeli strikeRead moreAccording to the latest figures from Gaza’s health authorities, the Israeli offensive has killed at least 55,000 people and wounded approximately 125,000. The death toll, which estimates suggest could be considerably higher, does not separate civilians from the number of militants killed.Fifty-six hostages are still held in Gaza by Hamas militants and other armed groups after they were captured on 7 October 2023 in attacks on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people. At least 20 of the hostages are believed to still be alive, according to Israeli authorities.The intelligence officers’ letter adds to open criticism in recent months from some quarters of the military. In April, 250 reservists and alumni from Unit 8200urged the government to end the war, though they stopped short of calling for a general refusal to serve.The latest statement calls on every Israeli “to do everything in their power” to oppose the war and says “some of us will refuse [to serve] publicly” while many others will refuse “in other, non-public ways”.One intelligence officer who has recently refused to serve said they could no longer participate in a war in which the military “didn’t think twice” aboutharming civilians when bombing targetsin Gaza.In an interview, they said: “I felt that it was immoral and insanely excessive. I felt that they stopped thinking and feeling, and they were willing to do everything to achieve a goal that wasn’t really a real goal … and if there is a goal, it’s to try to get rid of Gaza’s population by any means.”The IDF has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Her husband, Hamdi, had just dropped her at the town’s Nasser hospital where they both worked and had gone home to look after the children when the building was bombed.‘One of the most heartbreaking tragedies’: Gaza doctor’s last goodbye before nine children killed in airstrikeRead moreView image in fullscreenHamdi, centre, with two of his children, Eve and Rakan.Photograph: ReutersNajjar was at the hospital when the charred remains of seven of her children were brought in. Two were found later in the rubble andHamdi died a few days later of his injuries. Adam was the sole survivor. His hand had to be amputated and he suffered severe burns on his body.“I am not strong. Everyone says I am, they call me a hero because I keep going, but I want the right not to be strong,” Najjar toldLa Repubblica newspaperbefore her evacuation.“I am a woman whose children were killed, nearly all of them, when all I ever wanted was to protect them. Not just their bodies – I wanted to protect their feelings too. If God allowed this tragedy, there must be a reason. There has to be. But I don’t know what it is.”Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said Alaa and Adam al-Najjar would be accompanied on the flight to Milan by one of Adam’s aunts and four cousins, as well as the other patients and their families.In all, Tajani said, 80 Palestinians fromGazawould be flown on three planes to Milan, where they were due to arrive in the evening.Video footage posted on social media on Wednesday morning showed Najjar, veiled in black, embracing friends and relatives before boarding an ambulance alongside Adam, who waved from the front seat. His left arm was heavily strapped and bandaged.Their evacuation was arranged by the Italian foreign ministry after an appeal for help from Adam’s uncle Ali al-Najjar, was published in La Repubblica.TheNajjar children killedwere seven-month-old Sidar, two-year-old Luqman, Sadeen, aged three, Rifan, five, Raslan, seven, Jubran, eight, Eve, nine, Rakan, 10, and Yahya, 12.“I gave birth to them, I loved them, and I raised them for as long as I could,” their mother said. “They were happy and beautiful before the war.”The killing of a family of young children focused international attention once more on the toll Israel’s military campaign has takenon young Palestinians in Gaza. More than 16,000 children have been killed and another 34,000 wounded, according to local and UN estimates, since the conflict began on 7 October 2023, triggered by a Hamas attack on Israel.“I hope to write a new chapter of our life in Italy, but in a different book. I’ll do everything I can. After the surgery, Adam will learn Italian and go to school,” Najjar said.Asked by his mother about his hopes for the future, Adam said he wanted to “live in a beautiful place”.“A beautiful place is a place where there are no bombs. In a beautiful place the houses are not broken and I go to school,” he added. “Schools have desks, the kids study their lessons but then they go play in the courtyard and nobody dies.“A beautiful place is where they operate on my arm and my arm works again. In a beautiful place my mother is not sad. They told me that Italy is a beautiful place.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warItalyGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

As a result, Iceland has got the world’s best gender equality legislation.”He added: “But we’re not asking for time off, we’re asking for time on. We’re downing tools at work so that we can spend time with our families.“At the very least we want to see six weeks of paternity leave at regular pay. That was recommended by thewomen and equalities committee on Tuesday. It should be a basic minimum – the average across Europe is eight weeks. The UK paternity leave is lowest in Europe, and 40th out of 43 developed countries.”The group says that better paternity leave would help close the gender pay gap by helping families share childcare and thereby make it less likely for new mothers to take career breaks or go part-time.View image in fullscreenThe campaigners say that better paternity leave would help close the gender pay gap.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesGabriel, an IT consultant who is taking four months of paternity leave, also cited a new longitudinal study that foundaffectionate relationships between fathers and their sons reduced the risk of domestic violence. He said: “There’s a lot of pressure on fathers to protect and provide, but the research shows the most important thing you can provide your kids with is your presence. The most important way to protect our boys is to be active, healthy role models in their lives day to day.”The prospect of a dad strike was greeted with some scepticism by those who are wary about public money funding fathers. Gabriel says: “We have had some people who accuse us of being a bunch of woke dads from east London. But the polling shows 90% of fathers these days want to be an active, more active, part of their children’s lives.”Duncan Dragonetti, from Wiltshire, arrived at the rally after changing his daughter Thomasin’s nappy in St James’s Park. Despite the parental chores, he said he had had a “great time” spending the last four months with his daughter.He disputes the claim that only middle-class families would benefit from better paternity pay, having witnessed the benefits of Sweden’s generous system while working for Spotify. “In Sweden, you get 480 days between both parents over 10 years. The dads have to take 90 days or they lose them, so everyone takes it and the equality in the workforce is far more balanced.”Police officers ‘mocked and ostracised’ for paternity leave in England and WalesRead moreHe added: “Most modern fathers are looking to be closer to their children and want to spend their time with them.”Richard Odufisan, who works at a construction company, came to the protest with his three-year-old son Ewa asleep in his pushchair. He says the real parenting only begins after the two-week statutory period, and that the rate should be much higher. He said: “The current rate is less than 50% of the national living wage. If you were taking on parenting as a job, legally you can’t pay some one that low. Increasing would create an incentive for fathers, particularly those on lower salaries, to take parental leave.”Sophie Barnett was one of number of new mothers who was taking part in the protest. She came with her nine-month-old daughter Penny and her husband, James, who was allowed only two weeks of paternity leave.She said: “You have to parent as a team, but after two weeks that team gets torn apart at a really crucial time for the baby – they don’t sleep through the night, they have to wake up every three hours to eat. James had go back to work running on empty. It was really disruptive for the whole household.”Explore more on these topicsMaternity & paternity rightsParents and parentingMenEmployee benefitsFamilynewsShareReuse this content"

Agents told the family they did not have any water to provide during the family’s first day in detention; on the second day, all five were given a single bottle to share. The one fan in the room was pointed directly towards a guard, rather than towards the families in confinement, they told lawyers.“Because it was primarily men held in these facilities, they didn’t have separate quarters for families or for women,” said Yliana Johansen-Méndez, chief program officer at ImmDef. Clients explained that “eventually they set up a makeshift tent in an outside area to house the women and children. But clearly, there were no beds, no showers.”They have since been transferred to a“family detention” centerin Dilley, Texas, a large-scale holding facility retrofitted to hold children with their parents that was reopened under theTrump administration. Lawyers, who had been largely blocked from communicating with immigrants arrested amid theramped-up raids in LA,said family members were able to recount the ordeal only after they were moved out of state.View image in fullscreenThe South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, in 2019.Photograph: Jabin Botsford/Washington Post via Getty ImagesThe harrowing details are the first to emerge about the conditions that people are being held in following the immigration raids targeting LA-area businesses and neighborhoods.To quell the widespread protests that followed,Donald Trumpsent in military troops despiteopposition from California leaders.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said that it arrested 118 immigrants on Friday and over the weekend. Others were arrested at immigration offices and courthouses in the days prior. ImmDef and other local advocacy groups had compiled a separate list of more than 80 people who were apprehended – though many of them still do not appear in the agency’s online databases of detainees.Many of the people arrested were jailed ad hoc, in LA-area courthouses and administrative offices. Over the past several days, attorneys have taken shifts waiting outside federal immigration offices, attempting to speak to the immigrants, but federal agents and national guard troops have largely blocked lawyers and family members from visiting with those who were arrested, citing safety concerns amid widespread protests in the city. On Tuesday, the immigration court in downtown Los Angles had been shut down – and blocked off.DHS did not immediately respond to multiple Guardian queries about where it was holding people arrested in LA, and whether local offices had been given instruction to prepare supplies and facilities to hold immigrants prior to the large-scale raids in the region.Deteriorating conditions in detentionLegal aid groups were also largely denied access to immigrants who were transferred to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) processing center and detention center in Adelanto, in the high desert east of LA. “Ice’s excuse was, they’re still processing all the new people,” said Johansen-Méndez. Over the weekend and on Monday, her colleagues were only permitted to visit with a handful of clients at the Adelanto detention center, even though they had called ahead to confirm that at least 40 people referred to the organization had been sent there.View image in fullscreenCalifornia national guard officers in front of the federal building in Los Angeles on 10 June 2025.Photograph: Katie McTiernan/Anadolu via Getty ImagesSeveral people have already been deported. Luis Angel Reyes Savalza, a deportation defense attorney supporting the affected families in LA, said at least one person who was bused to Mexico almost immediately after his arrest was not provided any paperwork or opportunity to contest his deportation. At least two others who were arrested at LA-area carwashes were deported to Tijuana, according to Flor Melendrez, executive director of the Clean Carwash Worker Center.Another person was told by agents to sign a paper if he wanted to visit an attorney, Johansen-Méndez said – but believes he was tricked into signing some sort of voluntary departure paperwork. “Within hours, he was across the border to Mexico,” she said.Meanwhile, the family members of workers arrested at a clothing factory in downtown LA, in the parking lot at a Home Depot in the suburb of Paramount, and at a carwash in Culver City were desperately seeking answers about their loved ones’ whereabouts.Landi, whose husband was arrested on Friday while he worked a shift at the Ambiance Apparel warehouse, said he had reported to work that day as normal. “We never imagined he will be kidnapped by immigration,” she said at a news conference on Monday, outside the business’s gates. The Guardian is not using her surname to protect her family’s privacy and safety.“The day he was kidnapped, my family went to request information about his abduction, but Ice told us he wasn’t at the center,” she said. “However, after much effort and struggle from our lawyer, Ice simply confirmed that he was there.”Families were not allowed to bring their loved ones jackets or medications, lawyers said.View image in fullscreenImmigrants sit in a cell for incoming Ice detainees at the immigration detention center in Adelanto, California, on 13 April 2017.Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/ReutersThose who were able to confer with attorneys reported that as holding facilities in the city became crowded with immigrants, families were rushed out to detention centers in California’s high desert or in Texas. Agents confiscated belongings and provided little food or water, explaining to immigrants that the facilities had not prepared for the influx of detainees.Conditions in Adelanto were deteriorating as well, lawyers said. One of ImmDef’s clients reported that meals were provided late, blankets and clothing were scarce, and some people were sleeping on the floor of a day-use recreational room as beds filled up. One client said he witnessed an older man’s health dramatically decline after being denied medication for three days.On Sunday, Democratic US representatives Gilbert R Cisneros Jr, Judy Chu and Derek Tran said they wereblockedfrom entering Adelanto.DHS did not respond to a query asking why lawyers and lawmakers have been denied access.Making sense of the raidsWith limited access to immigrants in detention, attorneys are also scrambling to understand the scope of the raids, and the extent to which the Department of Homeland Security has violated immigrants’ rights.US immigration officials raid California farms as Trump ramps up conflictRead moreOne of the more unusual aspects of the large-scale militarized raids that began last week was that agents from Ice were joined by Customs and Border Protection officers, who are empowered to conduct warrantless stops – but only within 100 miles (160km) of the US border.Johansen-Méndez believes that the government has justified their presence inLos Angeles– which is more than 100 miles from the US-Mexico border –because the city touches the Pacific Ocean, which the administration could be considering as a “border”.“They’re counting the entire coastline as a port of entry,” said Johansen-Méndez. “It felt almost like an urban legend that it could be done. But at this point, it’s just they’re everywhere, literally.”Lawyers from ImmDef and other legal aid and advocacy groups have also been trying to piece together testimonies to better understand how and why immigration agents chose to sweep certain businesses and neighborhoods, and what justifications officers provided when stopping and apprehending people.“How do they decide who they’re going to ask for their papers and arrest, other than racially profiling?” Johansen-Méndez said. “Did they just ask everyone in the room for their papers or just some people? Did they skip certain people that didn’t fit the profile? We can’t get that information because we can’t talk to everyone.”Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles Ice protestsUS immigrationLos AngelesTrump administrationCaliforniaTexasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, a White House official said it merely reflected Trump’s worldwide 10% baseline “reciprocal” tariff on imports, the 20% fentanyl trafficking levy and a 25% pre-existing tariff on China.Writing on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump said: “Our deal with China is done, subject to final approval with president Xi and me … We are getting a total of 55% tariffs, China is getting 10%. Relationship is excellent!”After two days of negotiations in London, US and Chinese officials agreed on a framework to get their trade truce back on track and remove China’s export restrictions on the rare earth imports essential to US industries including automotive, electronics and defence, while offering little resolution to wider trade differences.Trump added in his post that in the deal, “full magnets, and any necessary rare earths, will be supplied, upfront, by China. Likewise, we will provide to China what was agreed to, including Chinese students using our colleges and universities (which has always been good with me!)”The US secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick, told reporters the London “framework” put “meat on the bones” of an agreement reached last month in Geneva to ease retaliatory tariffs that had reached crushing triple-digit levelsIt would, he said, allow them to “implement” the Geneva pact but was subject to the approval of Trump and Xi.The Geneva deal had faltered over China’s curbs on critical minerals exports, prompting the Trump administration to respond with export controls of their own preventing shipments of semiconductor design software, aircraft and other goods to China.Full details of the agreement were not immediately released and Trump has previouslycancelled trade agreementshe has brokered with major trading partners, including Mexico and Canada.The London deal came as the US car industry drew close to halting production because China had choked off the supply of magnets used in windshields and doors. China has a stranglehold on the global market of rare earths and magnets and introduced curbs in April after Trump’s decision to launch a trade war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Companies including Walmart, Best Buy, Ford and Procter & Gamble have all warned that the levies will be passed on to consumers.The president has been at loggerheads with the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, urging the head of the US central bank to lower interest rates.

They went too far.”Musk’s public apology came after the tech billionaire privately called Trump on Monday night, theNew York Times first reported, citing three people familiar with the matter.Musk’s call to Trump on Monday night followed a conversation he had on Friday with the vice-president,JD Vance, and the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, the New York Times reported. The three were said to have discussed the public feud during the call.The trio’s conversation on Friday came after Vance asked Trump how he would prefer to publicly address the feud, asource familiar with the matter told CNN. The source said Vance’s query to Trump came before an interview Vance was scheduled to do with Theo Von, a conservative podcast host.Trump told Vance to be diplomatic, CNN reports, citing the source. Duringthe podcast interview, which aired on Saturday, Vance said: “Really, man, I think it’s a huge mistake for him to go after the president like that … I actually think if Elon chilled out a little bit, everything would be fine.”Asked about the apparent apology, the president told the New York Post: “I thought it was very nice that he did that.” The comments came after the paper published a previously recorded interview, in which Trump had said “I guess I could” reconcile with Musk.The president said he “was not a happy camper” when theTeslachief executive launched last week’s tirade but claimed he had “no hard feelings for it”, adding: “I think he feels very badly, that he said that.”The possibility of a rapprochement – however superficial – appeared to be welcomed by investors. Tesla’s share price rose by 2.6% in pre-market trading.Unstoppable force loses battle with immovable object: Elon bows to TrumpRead moreThe public feud was one of the mostextraordinary turns in the relationshipbetween the two men. During the presidential campaign they had claimed to be ideological allies, and Musk briefly served in Trump’s government as head of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, a drive to slash government programmes nicknamed “Doge” afterthe internet meme. Experts have argued that thecost-cutting is illegal.Relations soured after Musk publicly criticised Trump’s “big beautiful bill”, saying it would add $2.4tn to US government borrowing andcalling it a “disgusting abomination”.Trump responded to Musk’s barrage of criticism by saying the tech billionaire “went crazy”. He also made direct references to Musk’s companies, highlighting the potential financial risks of the feud.In a direct reference to Tesla, Trump wrote on Truth Social, his own social media network: “I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted.” The electric car pioneer has been struggling withfalling sales in some markets, including much of Europe, in part, analysts say, because of Musk’s allegiance with Trump.Musk’s alignment with the US president had prompted a surge in the market value of Tesla, with investors hoping that the White House would look more favourably at the company’s autonomous driving technology. Musk’s retreat from the feud came a day before Tesla’s launch of a “robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas. That launch is seen as crucial for the company to justify its position as the world’s most valuable carmaker even as it struggles with an ageing lineup of products.Trump also threatened another of Musk’s key businesses, the rocket company SpaceX. Trump wrote: “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.”In practice the US government is unlikely to cancel SpaceX’s contracts, as it carries out more strategically important satellite launches than every other company in the world combined. Musk at first threatened to decommission SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft, the key vehicle to transport Nasa astronauts to the International Space Station, before withdrawing the threat.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskDonald TrumpTrump administrationTeslaUS politicsJD VancenewsShareReuse this content"

The president has repeatedly pledged to lower costs across the economy.Annualized inflation ticked higher, to 2.4%, in May, up from 2.3% in April. On a month-to-month basis, the consumer price index rose by 0.1%, down from 0.2% the previous month.The readings were softer than expected. Economists had expected a headline CPI reading for 2.5% in May, amid widespread uncertainty over the direction of theUS economy.Core inflation, which measures price increases outside of food and gas, went up 0.1% on the month, down from 0.2% in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.US inflation rate for May 2025In recent weeks, there have been signs of a slight cooldown in the economy, which had initiallyshown resiliency in the face of Trump’s tariffs.In May, the economy saw 139,000 new jobs, down from an average monthly gain of 149,000 over the prior 12 months. March’s and April’s job gains were also revised down. The unemployment rate has remained stable, however, hovering between 4% and 4.2% over the last few months.“CPI JUST OUT. GREAT NUMBERS!” Trump claimed in a post on his Truth Social platform, reiterating his call for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.But Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, ranking member of the Senate banking committee, said Trump’s tariffs were looming over the economy. “Last week’s jobs data showed a softening labor market,” she said. “Today’s inflation data shows food and electricity prices are up.”Since announcing the bulk of his tariffs on “liberation day” in early April, the Trump administration has tried to frame tariffs as good for the US economy in the long run. Trump has denied that his tariffs are leading to inflation,sayinglast week that prices have been going down.But economists say that gradual price increases will probably stay. Multiple retailers have said that they will increase prices due to tariffs, even as a supposed last resort. In a survey published last month by insurance company Allianz, 54% of US companies surveyed said they will have to raise prices.Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at OxfordEconomics, said: “The April consumer price index is welcome news. However, there is some noise in the inflation data and the boost from tariffs will be more noticeable this summer, which is part of our baseline forecast.”Meanwhile, there have been no indications that Trump’s tariffs have driven an increase in domestic manufacturing. In a survey published earlier this month, US manufacturing sentiment actuallydeclinedfor the third consecutive month, reaching a six-month low.Several of Trump’s tariffs are still in place, even after he paused the bulk of his reciprocal tariffs, which are set to go back into effect in July. There’s still a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods, a 30% tariff on Chinese imports (although Trumphailed a tentative dealbetween Washington and Beijing early on Wednesday) and a 25% tariff on auto imports, among others.Because the supply chain is so delicately intertwined between different countries and industries, tariffs can still cause price increases on seemingly unrelated goods. For example, after Trump doubled the tax on imported steel to 50%, canned foods are likely to seeprice increasesas the cost of cans has gone up.Investors are closely watching the Fed’s board meeting next week to see how monetary policymakers view the state of the economy. The Fed is expected to hold interest rates, which currently sit at between 4.25% and 4.5%, as officials have noted the instability caused by Trump’s tariffs.Explore more on these topicsUS economyInflationTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Her family moved to the Gulf coast from Vietnam during theJimmyCarter administration,and her dad, likemany such immigrantsto the area, worked as a fisher. The business gave Nguyen a front-row seat to one of the nation’s most abundant sources of seafood.Shrimp thrive in brackish waters, and Louisiana has the largest delta on the continent, where fresh water from the Mississippi River mixes with the Gulf of Mexico’s saltwater. In part due to the sheer expanse of this delta, Louisiana shrimpers provide nearly a quarter of all shrimp caught in the US, supplying anestimated 72m lb of shrimpin 2023 – the largest share of any state.View image in fullscreenA fisher loads shrimp into a tank on a boat in Galveston Bay, Texas, on 30 May 2018.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesBut things have changed drastically since the 1980s, when the Nguyen family settled in Louisiana. Demand and prices dropped during the Covid-19pandemic. A run of devastating hurricanes – Laura, Delta, Zeta and Ida – caused overhalf a billion dollars in lossesto the state’s seafood industry since 2020. Nguyen hoped that 2022 would be a turning point, but then Russia invaded Ukraine, and the price of diesel climbed, driving up the cost to operate trawlers. As inflation appeared to be climbing everywhere else,the wholesale price of shrimp declined.All these factors were happening alongside another massive, decades-long change: a surge in imported shrimp from Asia and South America. Talk to most shrimpers and they will say this familiar foe is driving down the price of shrimp, making it nearly impossible for US shrimpers to hang on.So when Donald Trump announcedsweeping tariffs, a move that threw global markets intotumultand caused consternation among many industries, some American shrimpers instead expressed optimism.Trump vowed to help US farmers. These four say his policies are ‘wreaking havoc’Read more“I know it’s going to affect a lot of other industries. But for us, it’s good,” said Aaron Wallace, who helps run Anchored Shrimp Company inGeorgia.The US shrimp industry pales in comparison to its counterparts in Ecuador, India, Indonesia and Vietnam. In those countries, aquaculture farms proliferate, churning out a prodigious volume of shrimp. Together, those four countries account for over 90% of shrimp imported to the US, or approximately 1.5bn lb of shrimp in 2023. That’s more than 20 times the amount of shrimp produced inLouisiana.“Really, our battle is the farm-raised shrimp industry overseas,” Wallace added. “We’re basically on our knees [due to] what the imports do.“The farm-raised industry has created a market where shrimp is readily available anywhere, everywhere,” he continued. “It’s changed the way we view shrimp versus back in the day.”Today, shrimp is the most widely consumed seafood in the US, outranking salmon, tuna and tilapia. Like chicken breast, it’s a protein that people expect to buy cheaply and regularly. Unlike its crustacean cousins, lobster and crab, which are typically associated with luxurious feasts, shrimp is economical andubiquitous. It’s frequently found on the menus of chains like Popeyes to all-you-can-eat specials at Sizzler and, formerly, Red Lobster.But shrimp’s cheapness and commonplaceness have come with a cost. Consumers aren’t often aware of the fact that most of the shrimp they consume is imported.Acy Cooper, president of the Louisiana Shrimp Association and a fourth-generation shrimper, said that tariffs provide an opportunity for US shrimpers to regain a foothold in the domestic seafood industry.View image in fullscreenLongtime shrimper Acy Cooper, keeps an eye on his nets as he begins a 12-hour plus overnight shift of shrimping on 26 August 2019 off the coast of Plaquemines parish, Louisiana.Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images“We are losing our local industry,” Cooper said. That moved Cooper to vote for Trump, hoping he would “make America great again in all sectors”, including shrimping.When Cooper was growing up in the 1970s, shrimping was a good job, one that could easily support a family. Later, in the 1980s, when Cooper was first getting his start, he could get $1 per pound of small shrimp and $4.50 per pound of large shrimp. But last year, he could barely get $1 per pound from dockside buyers for his biggest shrimp.“Look, I quit school in the eighth grade and went to work fishing because I made more money than college graduates at the time,” Cooper said. But his own son chose to leave the industry. “He just broke the chain in my family,” Cooper said. “He’s got three kids in his household, and he couldn’t make enough to survive.”Deborah Long, a spokesperson for the Southern Shrimp Alliance, said: “The problem is not cheap imports. The problem is the counterproductivetrade policieswe have that have led to cheap imports” and that other countries benefit from practices not allowed in the US.Long pointed to the fact that manyforeign aquaculture operations are subsidized by international financial institutions backed by taxpayer dollars and employunpaid laboror use bannedantibiotics. From Long’s perspective, these factors allow foreign shrimp suppliers to undercut domestic shrimp suppliers’ prices.“When you look at trade data, you will find that the 1980s were the heydays for this industry,” Long said. “Aquaculture came around, and shrimpers were able to compete against it. And around the early 2000s, you started seeing a flood of imports. That’s where allegations ofdumping– selling below fair value – came in.”However, Martin Smith, a Duke University economist who studies fisheries and seafood markets, said it was not clear that Trump’s recent broad-based tariffs – those that target a wide array of goods – are the right tool to address a flood of cheap shrimp imports.He noted that the US Department of Commerce was already working onanti-dumping and countervailing duties, which aim to counteract the impact of dumping and governmental subsidies, on the biggest importers of shrimp. Already, those duties were showingmodest improvementsin ex-vessel prices, the prices that shrimpers are paid at the dock.“In principle, the system had already addressed the aspects of competition that are unfair,” Smith said. “This additional layer of broad-based tariffs is really just saying that we are now going to make it unfair for the rest of the world.”Smith also cautioned that any efforts to bolster the prices of shrimp could risk reducing the overall demand for shrimp, which would also adversely impact domestic shrimpers.“There’s some real long-term risk here in using tariffs to try to elevate the prices of domestic product … It could actually just push them back into being luxury goods,” Smith said.Still,Long, of the Southern Shrimp Alliance, applauded Trump’s tariffs, which she hoped would put a dent in imports, while also acknowledging that it wouldn’t be a magic bullet for all of the issues facing shrimpers.“It is a short-term measure that is desperately needed to support these guys and get them through other seasons while we address these systemic problems,” Long said.But Nguyen remained skeptical as to whether the tariffs would actually help the industry to which she’s dedicated her whole life.“I’m not excited about anything that Trump does,” Nguyen said. “Even though I’m broke, I can’t trust that his tariffs are going to help us because I understand the economics of the industry.”She pointed out that tariffs could cause the price of rope, steel or even nets to go up, making the work of shrimping even more costly.Plus, from Nguyen’s point of view, it’s not just cheap imports driving down the prices; it’s also the fact that there are fewer processors and wholesale distributors as the industry has consolidated, leaving shrimpers withlittle room to negotiate at the docks.A drop in the ocean: does experimental technology hold the key to saving the world’s seas?Read moreA report on theLouisiana shrimp value chain, produced for the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, recognized this disconnect, noting that shrimpers like Nguyen are at the bottom of a value chain that is trying to compete with low global prices. Shrimpers get the short end of the stick even when consumers are paying more for the shrimp at their supermarket or on their dinner plate.Long, of the Southern Shrimp Alliance, echoed that point.“While the prices collapsed from 2021 to 2023, and the industry lost more than half of its value – and the values of imports plunged $1.5bn as well – consumer prices, the retail price you would pay at a grocery store, reached record highs,” Long said. “There’s a big disconnect in the market there.”Nguyen put it more bluntly.“It’s the big dogs, the big companies, that hurt us,” she said, referring to the dockside buyers, as well as to the network of processors, distributors and retailers. “Part of the reason our prices went down drastically is that we’re making enough shrimp for all of them to get filthy rich.”In her opinion, tariffs won’t fix that problem. And it won’t fix the devastation she has seen among shrimpers fighting to survive.By 2023, she noted shrimpers she knew had “strokes, heart attacks, overdoses, domestic violence and children not being able to go to college”, Nguyen said. “An entire way of life was stripped from us for the last three years at no fault of our own.”Explore more on these topicsFishingOur unequal earthLouisianaGeorgiaAgricultureTariffsMarine lifeTrump tariffsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The two cases have been called“mega trials”and involved hundreds of barristers and solicitors.Butcher said the central question to the case was whether the cause of any loss of the aircraft was “a commercial decision of the Russian airlines leasing the aircraft, in which case the all risks insurers would be liable to the claimants, or an act or order of the Russian government, in which case the war risk insurers would also be liable”.Western sanctions forced aircraft leasing companies to cancel their contracts with Russian carriers by 28 March 2022, initially leaving the industry with losses estimated to be $10bn.Butcher concluded that “the aircraft have been lost” because Russiahad already seized them before the sanctions deadline, as their “loss occurred on 10 March 2022” when a piece of Russian legislation banned the export of aircraft and aircraft equipment from Russia.Initially, Russia faced demands to return the “stolen” planes but Moscow refused, prompting the claims in Dublin and London. Many of the planes were re-registered by Russia without their owners’ consent and sold on to Russian airlines.Butcher said insurers were not prevented by EU or US sanctions from indemnifying the claimants for the loss of aircraft that had been leased to Russian airlines.The London trial, which ended in February, related to 147 aircraft and 16 standalone engines that the companies could not retrieve after war broke out.AerCap, the world’s largest aircraft lessor, brought a claim in respect of 116 aircraft and 15 engines, according to the court papers, while DAE was seeking to recover losses from the stranding of 22 aircraft. Court papers show DAE managed to recover three but the rest were “lost” in Russia on 10 March 2022.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

OMG-mont. Over the top-mont. The prevailing sense among anybody who ponders aUS Openat this site in rural Pennsylvania is how wonderfully demanding the challenge always is. Cue entertainment. As Xander Schauffele appropriately put it: “I don’t think people turn the TV on to watch some of the guys just hit a 200-yard shot on the green. They turn on the US Open to see a guy shooting eight over and suffer. That’s part of the enjoyment of the US Open for viewers.”Strap in and enjoy the show. This version of Oakmont has rough that is routinely more than five inches thick. Menacing, sloped greens add to the idea of inevitable carnage. The 125th staging of the major will be a war of attrition, one which will physically and mentally exhaust the finest golfers in the world. Temper tantrums are guaranteed.‘It felt impossible’: McIlroy struggles in practice at Oakmont before US OpenRead moreThe job of the United StatesGolfAssociation is to ensure the environment is at least fair. Dissenting voices exist already on that front. Take Michael Kim, the world No 54. “The greens here feel a bit Mickey Mouse,” Kim said. “The weird sections and overall slopes are just way more than we’re used to.”This will be met with shrugs at the USGA. This is a major with a 288-yard par three, after all. The organisers seem to revel in the kind of chaos Schauffele referenced. Mike Whan, the USGA’s chief executive, offered sharp historical perspective. “1,385 players have played a major championship on this venue,” he said. “And 27 of them finished their four days under par, 2%. So that’s quite a test out there.”Oakmont laps up its reputation as the sternest of tests. A T-shirt sold in the club shop bears a quote from the son of the course’s founder: “Let the clumsy, the spineless, the alibi artist stand aside.” Phil Mickelson, a short-game maestro, was pictured struggling to move the ball from greenside rough during his practice on Wednesday.Scottie Scheffler played in the 2016 US Open here as an amateur. If there is a gap in the world No 1’s illustrious CV, it relates to his ability to handle the major sites thatare not Augusta Nationalor the player-friendly US PGA Championship. Scheffler’s next step is to demonstrate he can emerge successfully from the grind, edging closer to a career grand slam. In his favour at Oakmont is his unshakable temperament and incredible accuracy with irons in hand.It seems incredibleto write off Rory McIlroy’s chanceswithin weeks of his epic Masters success. However, the Northern Irishman is clearly grasping for rhythm after achieving all he ever wanted to achieve. McIlroy’s close friend Shane Lowry looks to have a strong chance here. So, too, does his Ryder Cup teammate Justin Rose. Collin Morikawa, Corey Conners and Russell Henley are all worthy of attention. Schauffele, who has been disrupted by injury since winning two majors in 2024, once again has live hope as he edges back to form.View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler’s level-headed temperament should aid his chances of handling Oakmont.Photograph: Andrew Redington/Getty Images“Tough but fair,” said John Bodenhamer, the USGA’s director of championships. “A lot of discussion about Oakmont being tough. It certainly is, but our mantra is tough but fair. What does that mean? It’s pretty simple. It’s not about the score, it’s about getting every club in a player’s bag dirty, all 15 of them. The 14 in their bag and the one between their ears. And we work hard on that, and that’s how we’ve gone about our business here at Oakmont. It’s the culture of this club. They want it to be tough.“When you think about the cream rising to the top, think about this: of the nine men to win the US Open at Oakmont, eight have won at least two majors. And of the nine men that won the US Open at Oakmont, six are in the World Golf Hall of Fame. I’d venture to think that Ángel Cabrera and Dustin Johnson have a pretty good chance of getting in there and making it eight of nine again, so the ghosts matter.”Cabrera was five over par when he won in 2007. Johnson closed at four under nine years later. Either outcome is possible here: if rain forecast for Friday and more seriously on Saturday hits, a softer site will trigger improved scoring. If Oakmont stays dry and becomes firmer, over par is likely to win.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last month, the PGA of America doubled down on its view that an upcoming rollback of the golf ball should be paused. ThePGA Touragrees. The USGA, in conjunction with the R&A, has proposed the plan from 2028 onwards. The USGA has no apparent desire to change approach. Golf could be on the brink of another civil war just as it is no closer to solving the one created by LIV’s arrival.Whan was asked whether he had a plan B on the golf ball. “We’ve announced our plan,” he responded. “I get this isn’t easy and everybody has got their own constituents. As an industry we have to be able to make small adjustments that are in the best interest of the game long-term, that we all know would be better 40 years from now if we were smart enough to make them today. We’ll make those.“Not everybody will like it. It’ll be high anxiety until we get there. But nobody is going to die. The game is going to be great. We’re going to prove that we can be better for future generations rather than to simply look the other way and know that in 40 or 50 years we’d be handing them something we could have made small adjustments on. We’re full-speed ahead on what we’ve announced. Those decisions have been made.”Big picture stuff can wait. Four days at Oakmont will be unapologetically tortuous.Explore more on these topicsUS OpenPGA TourGolfEuropean TourRory McIlroyScottie SchefflerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We can win the World Cup.”US-based soccer fans: are you going to a Club World Cup game this summer?Read moreHowever fanciful, the statement was also refreshing at the time, coming just a few months after the team’shumiliating group-stage exitfrom the 2024 Copa América. But it seemed a little odd whenPochettino mentionedthe possibility of a US World Cup victory again afterSaturday’s 2-1 loss to Turkey. And after Tuesday night’s4-0 capitulation to Switzerland, it seems downright silly it was ever said at all.The US have now lost four consecutive games. The World Cup is one year away. And for Pochettino, lofty beliefs in what would be one of the biggest sporting surprises of all time – a USMNT World Cup victory – has been replaced by a mea culpa, and doubts over whether his approach to the job is enough to prevent the US from being embarrassed at home again, on a stage many magnitudes larger than it was on Tuesday.To be sure, Pochettino and his staff should not take the blame for Tuesday’s rout alone. Much of it, maybe even the majority, should land on the players, who put forth an abysmal first-half showing that fully earned the boos which rained down from a two-thirds full (at best) Geodis Park in Nashville. The United States gave up four goals in 36 minutes – the first time since 1980 that they’ve conceded that many times so soon after kickoff, and the first time ever at home. Attacking ideas were practically nonexistent before half-time. Most worryingly, there was a distinct lack of energy and commitment – an intangible, non-tactical deficiency that similarly doomed the team in March’s Nations League losses which set off their current identity crisis.The US men’s national team has more of the last thing it needs: sports dad dramaRead moreThis malaise was worrying enough to see in March, when it set in among a first-choice squad tipped for big things next year. On Tuesday, it surfaced among a group of players for whom energy and commitment should have been one of their major strengths – and perhaps the only area in which they conceivably could have held an advantage over the Swiss.Between the numerous absences from this squad and the heavy lineup rotation, this was for all intents and purposes a US “C” team. The starters averaged just 18 caps, with five players earning their fifth appearance or fewer. Nine of them had been on the bench against Turkey.So, yes, the team that lost against Switzerland on Tuesday was missing established stars such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Antonee Robinson and Tyler Adams. But that meant every single US starter had something to prove. The US has depth spots to fill at most positions, and Pochettino said he would use these friendlies and the upcoming Gold Cup to find players to fill those spots for the World Cup. One would think that would be motivation enough. The fact that motivation was missing does not reflect well on the players, and the fact that it’s happening across the entire player pool does not reflect well on Pochettino and his staff.“This was a chance for them to show that they belong on the national team,” former USMNT great DaMarcus Beasley said on TNT afterward. “They weren’t up for the fight. They didn’t want to compete. And I don’t know how that can be, mentally, when this is your shot!”Somewhere in some alternate universe, there exists a type of 4-0 loss that would have been understandable for this group against the very strong team Switzerland sent out – this, remember, is a squad who reached the Euro 2024 quarter-finals, wherethey outplayed England for large parts of the matchbefore losing on penalties. There would have been no shame in eager defending beaten by better skill; in technically-sound goalkeeping bettered by unsaveable shots; in genuine attempts to play forward that simply did not connect. The US probably weren’t going to outplay Switzerland, but they could have at least tried to outwork them. Instead, the US struggled to put in a tackle as the Swiss diced up their midfield, a save was parried directly into the path of Breel Embolo on the goalline, and a team that improved markedly in the second half still failed to put a single shot on target.Pochettino cannot force the players to put in effort, to get time with their clubs, to be better than their talent dictates. He can, however, pick a squad that functions together as a unit, with players in roles suited to them and that accentuate the strengths they’ve shown on the club scene. On Tuesday, he failed to do so.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionTo pick just one position group: Nathan Harriel played as a right-back on Tuesday – the position where he broke through with the Philadelphia Union, but not one he has played all that often in 2025 (he’s mostly been a center-back, but has filled in at spots all over the field). Max Arfsten, meanwhile, plays as a left-wingback for a very attack-minded Columbus Crew team, which is maybe not the best preparation for playing left-back in a four-man backline against a team capable of exploiting open space when defenders are caught upfield. Both were beaten on their respective sides for the game’s first two goals.In goal, Pochettino chose to start Matt Turner despite his near-complete lack of game time for Crystal Palace this past season and the solid-enough debut for Matt Freese against Turkey. Turner’s weak parry resulting in Switzerland’s third goal betrayed an unsurprising lack of match sharpness.There are other examples, particularly in midfield, of what would have been understandable lineup decisions for a squad that wasn’t in desperate need of positive momentum. As it was, those decisions look questionable – especially given how much the attitude and fight of the squad changed for the better after Pochettino made five half-time subs (including the always-impressive Diego Luna) and changed the shape of the team to better deal with Switzerland’s approach (which closely resembled the Swiss tactics for their 4-2 win over Mexico earlier in this window.)“[The lineup] was my decision. And the decision didn’t work,” Pochettino told reporters after the match. “I am guilty and I am responsible.”The candor feels half as refreshing as the World Cup boast, and it will wear out twice as quickly if this continues into the fall.Explore more on these topicsUSAMauricio PochettinoWorld Cup 2026US sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So this was a decision that was best for my soul.”Why are members of the Super Bowl champion Eagles promoting a right-wing Christian wealth scheme?Read moreAnd one the Steelers believe is best for business, one of the reasons they put no pressure on Rodgers during the spring as he dealt with off-the-field issues that he has said included having multiple people in his inner circle battle cancer.Rodgers said those issues “have improved a bit,”clearing the way for him to joina team that has bounced from one quarterback to another since Ben Roethlisberger retired at the end of the 2021 season.He added that the Steelers’ long-time head coach Mike Tomlin, who has never had a losing season since taking over the team in 2007, was a major factor in his decision to return to football. The two stayed in contact over the last few months, producing what Rodgers called “some of the coolest conversations I’ve had in the game.”“It starts with Mike Tomlin,” Rodgers said. “I’ve been a fan of his for a long time. There’s a few iconic franchises in theNFL. I played for one of ‘em for 18 years. This is another one of those. There’s something special about obviously this area. So many great quarterbacks are from Pittsburgh. I feel like Pittsburgh has been a part of my career from the beginning.”Rodgers, who has worked out with recently acquired DK Metcalf in recent months, hopes some of the Steelers’ skill position players can join him at his home in Malibu, California, sometime before they report for the team’s full training camp on 23 July.If they do, they may get a chance to meet Rodgers’ wife. Rodgers was spotted wearing what looked like a wedding band when he signed his Steelers contract. Rodgers confirmed on Tuesday that he was married “a couple months” ago but declined to get into details. Rodgers has revealed little about his wife. During an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show last fall, he mentioned he was dating a woman named Brittani but offered no other details.Usually, Rodgers is not afraid to express his views about many topics, from vaccines to politics and beyond. But on Tuesday, he stuck to football.“It’s hard to think of anything in my life that’s positive that wasn’t impacted by directly or indirectly by playing this game,” he said. “So [I] just want to give love back to the game, enjoy it, pass on my knowledge to my teammates, and try and find ways to help lead the team.”The Steelers are unlikely to get the version of Rodgers who once cut a swathe through theNFLin his prime with the Green Bay Packers, winning four league MVP awards and a Super Bowl along the way. Rodgers’s tenure with his last team, the Jets, was brief and rocky. After a torn achilles ended his 2023 debut after just four snaps, he returned in 2024 to start all 17 games. Though he threw for 3,897 yards and 28 touchdowns, the Jets finished just 5-12, and Rodgers ranked outside the top 25 in most efficiency metrics. The team sputtered to a 3-7 record in one-score games.Without Rodgers, the Steelers would probably have started Mason Rudolph, who recently rejoined the team from the Tennessee Titans. However, Rudolph was a modest quarterback at best during his first stint with the team.Rodgers will face a familiar foe in Week 1 of the upcoming season: Pittsburgh are scheduled to play the Jets in their 2025 opener. They play the Packers in Week 8.Explore more on these topicsAaron RodgersPittsburgh SteelersNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

All that could be heard was the deep blare of a horn from a large vehicle, which went on for an uncomfortably long time. Then the realisation dawned. It was the Senegal team bus and the driver was geeing up the gaggle of fans draped in the country’s colours, still ecstatic at howthey had beaten England 3-1.The celebrations had got into full swing when Cheikh Sabaly, on as a substitute,swept home the clinching goalin stoppage time, the Senegal bench emptying, everybody wanting in on it. No team from Africa had beaten England before and it did not matter it was a friendly. The scene in the visiting dressing room was probably best described – as heard – by Thomas Tuchel.Eberechi Eze offers England’s brightest spark amid end-of-season gloom | Jonathan LiewRead more“The players came in … it was next to my changing room … screaming: ‘Senegal!’ The next one: ‘Senegal!’” theEnglandhead coach said. “Hitting on boxes and whatever. It was not offensive. It was nice to see what it means to them.”Tuchel wondered how his players would have reacted if they had won 3-1. “Would player after player go in the dressing room, would the coach go in the dressing room, screaming: ‘England’? Would the players jump up and down? Or would we all say: ‘Hey guys, it’s a friendly match, this is what we expect’?”Tuchel’s question was essentially rhetorical. England would not have been overjoyed. “We would have said: ‘Calm down, it’s just a friendly, it was good but OK … a good development, put it into context,’” he said. “It shows me what it means to them, an excitement and joy to celebrate this victory. We are not there at the moment.“We expect a lot from us. I get it because we expect also a lot from us and myself. I’m missing a little bit the excitement and laughter and the joy. I see it in training. I saw a glimpse of it after the 2-1 [for Senegal in the 62nd minute]. I liked the reaction [to that goal]. But in general: no.”View image in fullscreenÉdouard Mendy (left) and Nicolas Jackson lead Senegal’s post-match celebrations.Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Getty ImagesFor Tuchel, something is missing and he seems a little baffled. When he breezed into the job, it was with talk of a quick and aggressive approach, of Premier League passions, of a band of brothers high-fiving their way to World Cup glory. The famous Tommy Tuchel main character energy would light a fire in everyone. It has not happened, the overall sense being a heaviness of body and soul, safe passes into feet, not enough dynamic running or risk-taking.It is a worry.Tuchel is not the first England coach to see a gap between how the players express themselves at club level and for the national team; how happiness and freedom can be overtaken by fear of what might go wrong, a desire just to muddle through. Against Senegal, there were other causes for alarm, starting with a back four that has a transitional feel with John Stones injured and Tuchel looking beyond Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw.It was easy to fret about the fourth member of the defensive line that has served England so well for so long. Kyle Walker was awfully slow to react to Ismaïla Sarr’s run for the Senegal equaliser and it chimed with a jittery performance undermined by an apparent lack of certainty in the attribute that has always sustained him: pace. Has it finally deserted him?Tuchel made the point that Walker lacked rhythm after a disrupted end to the season with Milan, mainly because of a broken arm. It was his first start since 5 April. Tuchel also said it was vital that Walker, and every other England player, was able to resolve his club situation.Walker is back at Manchester City, but he will not go with themto the Club World Cup. The 35-year-old has been written off before, not least when he went more than a year without a cap under Gareth Southgate from the summer of 2019. He must find the answers again if he is to reach 100 caps. He is on 96.There were errors across the defence against Senegal; the first two concessions, in particular, so cheap after routine balls over the top. Trevoh Chalobah was exposed on the first, Myles Lewis-Skelly on the second. Then there was the structure as England tried to build out from the goalkeeper, Dean Henderson.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Passes went astray under pressure. Tuchel needs time to finesse the patterns and it will be vital to master a controlled, possession-based approach for the expected high temperatures at the World Cup next summer. He does not have time.View image in fullscreenIt was a sobering evening for Thomas Tuchel, who was left feeling England have ‘a lot to learn’.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersThe good bit against Senegal, after the stodge ofthe 1-0 qualifying win over Andorrain Barcelona on Saturday, came in response to Habib Diarra’s goal for 2-1. With Morgan Gibbs-White and Morgan Rogers on and Eberechi Eze coming alive, there was speed and intensity, promising combinations. Tuchel would also introduce Jude Bellingham and Noni Madueke in the 71st minute. An equaliser looked on, although it did not come, Bellingham having a goal disallowed towards the end.There were questions within this, including where it left Harry Kane, who made way for Rogers. The captain scored England’s early goal and caught the eye, dropping deep to make turns and play searching passes. However, the team danced to his tune and played at a slower pace. Perhaps, as Tuchel has suggested, England will need more than one way of working.As Tuchel assesses the camp, he will know there were mitigating factors for the performances. The tired legs after a gruelling club season. The awkward break between its climax and the international matches, the need for many players to effectively clock back on. The lack of jeopardy against Andorra and Senegal.Tuchel is fond of telling reporters what the headline in their newspapers should be. So, what was it after Senegal? “Your headline is maybe a bit harder than I would make a headline,” he said, with a smile. “Headline: yeah … a lot to learn.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelSenegal football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The analysis also warns that uncertainty over the role and scope of an independent regulator is “unhelpful” to those wishing to join the rush of investors entering the sport.Lisa Nandy removes herself from final decision on leader of football regulatorRead moreThe Annual Review of Football Finance painted an overall picture of a booming industry, pointing out that the European football market was worth a record £32.2bn in 2023-24. More than £16.9bn of that wasgenerated by the “big five” leagues, with the Premier League alone recording revenues of £6.3bn. Deloitte cautioned, though, that those numbers do not tell the full tale of a game caught between its community roots and the requirement for continued growth. “There can be no doubt that the system in English football is under strain,” said Tim Bridge, lead partner at Deloitte sports business group, in the report’s foreword. “Repeated reports of fan unrest at ticket price and accessibility demonstrate the challenge in the modern era of balancing commercial growth with the historic essence of afootball club’s role and position in society: as a community asset.”A bill to create the independent football regulator went through its second reading in parliament last month. It could transform the game’s governance but Bridge cited the gap between Premier Leagueand Championship financesas a problem that must be addressed. “It is clear that the way in which the game is governed and the regulation that underpins it needs to seek to drive value, fan engagement [both physical and digital] and competitive balance,” he said.“The two most recent seasons underscore the challenge, as in each season, all three clubs promoted from the Championship were subsequently relegated after just one season in thePremier League. The financial implications of the ‘yo-yo effect’ on clubs, their spending, and overall competitiveness are major factors to address in order to continue attracting high levels of investment across the system.”The hope is that the regulator can begin its work this autumn, although roadblocks include a likely inquiry into the government’s choice for its chair, David Kogan. Bridge pointed out that the uncertainty about its form rings alarm bells for investors. “The level of interest and the demand to engage with English football remains high and investors still see the opportunity, particularly when there is a strong community link or adjacent investment opportunities, but the lack of clarity over the future regulatory regime is now unhelpful,” he said.He noted that other “big five” leagues – those of France, Germany, Italy and Spain – are monitoring the regulator’s possible effects, seeing it as a potential opportunity to close the financial chasm that has opened between England’s top flight and the rest. The Premier League’s aggregate revenue was almost double the £3.2bn recorded by La Liga, its nearest competitor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is about £25m less than Paris Saint-Germain banked from Uefa for their 17-game Champions League-winning campaign, leading to concerns from clubs who have missed out.The Fifa Club World Cup, explained: everything you wanted to know about the tournamentRead moreBarcelona, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Milan are among the big clubs with large fanbases who have not qualified and unlessFifalifts its cap of 12 European entrants, expansion is the only way to ensure more European competitors.Next year’s men’s World Cup and the2031 Women’s World Cupwill involve 48 teams for the first time, so expanding the Club World Cup would be consistent with Fifa’s new tournament model. Fifa sources said that although serious discussions regarding expansion had yet to take place, talks with all stakeholders about the Club World Cup’s format and structure would be held after this summer’s tournament.Another possible change being pushed by Premier League clubs is increasing the cap of two clubs from one country, a restriction that led to Liverpool missing out despite meeting one of the qualifying criteria of having one of the best eight Champions League records of clubs who did not win the competition between 2021 and 2024. Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid qualified as Champions League winners during that period, with nine European clubs qualifying through Uefa rankings because Madrid won the competition twice, in 2022 and 2024.Fifa has waived the two-per-country limit for clubs that won their continental competition in that period, leading to Brazil having four clubs from four successive Copa Libertadores victories.The US have three clubs taking part after Los Angeles beat the Mexican side Club Américain a playofftriggered by the expulsion of Club León for a breach of multi-club ownership rules.In an interviewwith the Athleticlast week Fifa’s general secretary, Mattias Grafström, said all options were open for 2029. “For the future we are very open-minded to look at formats and so on that we will discuss with the clubs and with the confederations,” he said. “I believe strongly in the future of this competition.”Expanding the Club World Cup would be well received in particular by European clubs, whose commercial strength and global popularity are not reflected in this year’s entry list. A bigger tournament involving more of the bigger European clubs would also suit Fifa, which initially struggled to sell commercial deals for the competition.View image in fullscreenInter players board their flight to Los Angeles to take part in the 2025 Club World Cup.Photograph: Mattia Ozbot/Inter/Getty ImagesDazn agreed to pay $1bn for global TV rights in a deal that allows it to sublicense to other broadcasters on a regional basis, withChannel 5 buying the rightsfor 23 matches in the UK.The Dazn deal is being funded by a 10% investment in the company by Saudi Arabia’s SURJ Sports Investment and Saudi money is underpinning the tournament, with the country’s Public Investment Fund announced as tournament partners last week. The longtime Fifa sponsors Adidas, Coca-Cola and Visa have also come on board after initially resisting. Ticket sales have been mixed, however.Expansion would be resisted by the international players’ union, Fifpro, which along with the lobby group European Leagues has filed a legal complaint to the European Commissionaccusing Fifaof “abuse of dominance” for allegedly failing to consult them over the scheduling of the tournament.Fifa has denied the allegations and accused some leagues of “commercial self-interest” and “hypocrisy”.

If you haven’t seen the video of the 17-year-old scoringa stunning free-kick against arch-rivals Boca Juniors in April,watch it now. Premier League clubs expressed an interest in the young forward but, when Real Madrid come knocking, few players reject the chance to move to the Bernabéu. Mastantuono is such an exciting talent; when he made his debut for Argentina earlier this month in a World Cup qualifier against Chile, he was 17 years and 296 days old, a new record for a competitive match. Real Madrid spent €45m to sign the talented right winger, who has a low centre of gravity, an eye for a defence-splitting pass, a wand of a left foot. Sound familiar?Jonathan Tah to Bayern MunichA move a long time in the making, Bayern Munich have finally landed one of their top centre-back targets, having confirmed the addition of Jonathan Tah from Bundesliga rivalsBayer Leverkusen. The defender decided against renewing his contract with the Bundesliga runners-up and instead joined the champions on a free transfer. The 29-year-old is excellent with the ball at his feet, having returned the fourth best pass success rate (93.1%) in the division this season. Tah should slot in well for Vincent Kompany’s side.Eric Dier to MonacoAs one centre-back joinsBayern Munich, another leaves for pastures new. While he wasn’t considered first choice by Kompany, Eric Dier was still a handy option to call upon, starting 16 league matches this season, returning a pass success rate of 94% (the second best in the Bundesliga) and securing the first trophy of his career. The 31-year-old has signed a three-year contact with Monaco, who finished third in Ligue 1 and booked their place in the Champions League.Petar Sucic to InterInter have wasted no time adding to their ranks before the Club World Cup, with Petar Sucic making the move from Dinamo Zagreb. The 21-year-old offers a bit of everything in the middle of the park, with his performances for Dinamo Zagreb and Croatia impressing the Nerazzurri. Able to cover for a number of different midfield roles, he has been compared to former Inter man Marcelo Brozovic, albeit a more physical version, which should sit well with supporters.View image in fullscreenPetar Sucic playing for Croatia.Photograph: Pixsell/MB Media/Getty ImagesLuis Henrique to InterLuis Henrique featured in all but one of Marseille’s 34 league matches this season, but the club were prepared to listen to offers for the Brazilian winger. The 23-year-old had a good season inLigue 1, scoring seven goals and picking up seven assists, which convinced Inter to sign him for €23m on a five-year deal. His ability to operate at right wing-back will appeal to newly appointed Inter manager Cristian Chivu, who ended up playing a three-man backline while at Parma.Lorenz Assignon to StuttgartRennes had an indifferent Ligue 1 campaign so it’s not a surprise to see one of their most promising players keen to move to pastures new. German side VfB Stuttgart saw enough to pursue the 24-year-old right-back. Sebastien Hoeness used a number of players down the right last season, and the hope now is that the Frenchman will prove a long-term solution in a problematic position. Assignon, who had a stint with Burnley in the Premier League under Kompany, is the son of the former Togo player Komlan Assignon.Benedict Hollerbach to Mainz 05Union Berlin’s sub-par season came at a cost, as they waved goodbye to striker Benedict Hollerbach. The 24-year-old, who grew up in Munich and represented both 1860 Munich and Bayern Munich at youth level, made his big break with Union Berlin, where he has scored 14 goals in two seasons. He is not the most consistent but Mainz, who are gearing up for their first European campaign in almost 10 years, have seen enough to sign the versatile forward, who can also play out wide. With Jonathan Burkardt set for a move for Eintracht, Mainz will hope Hollerbach fills the void.Tom Bischof to Bayern MunichBayern Munich are well stocked with central midfielders, but Tom Bischof is still a handy pick-up for the German champions. The 19-year-old made more tackles (95) than any other player in theBundesligathis season, and Lamine Yamal was the only teenager to make more key passes in Europe’s top five leagues. A technically gifted all-rounder, he will give Bayern a vital injection of youth.View image in fullscreenTom Bischof playing for Germany against France in the Nations League.Photograph: Kevin Voigt/Getty ImagesJoan García to BarcelonaJoan García has made the short trip acrossBarcelona, leaving Espanyol for the La Liga champions. García had Premier League suitors, and it is easy to see why. The 24-year-old made more saves (142) than any other goalkeeper in La Liga this season, and ranked among the top 10 players for accurate long balls (6.1 per 90 minutes) in the division. He will be first choice for the Blaugrana before long.Ibrahim Maza to Bayer LeverkusenPerhaps Bayer Leverkusen already have their Florian Wirtz replacement on the books, having signed Ibrahim Maza from Hertha Berlin last month. Hertha had a tough season in the German second tier but Maza was a shining light at the Olympiastadion. The teenage Algeria international finished the season second for successful dribbles (75) and 11th for possession won in the attacking third (17). With five goals and three assists to his name, Maza is one to watch as Leverkusen gear up for a new chapter under Erik ten Hag.This is an article byWhoScoredExplore more on these topicsFootballGuardian Sport NetworkTransfer windowEuropean club footballReal MadridBarcelonaBayern MunichBayer LeverkusenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It increased the obligatory number of home league matches a season-ticket holder must attend from 14 to 16, but also mandated that only six of those games could be shared with friends or handed back to the club for resale.City believe that ticket use is a growing problem for the club, having told City Matters in February that an average 8% of 37,000 season-ticket members do not attend a given Premier League game. Liverpool and Arsenal have mandatory attendance requirements for season-ticket holders but neither cap the number of games that can be shared or resold. Arsenal exempt season-ticket holders with disabilities from the cap.Ryan Bradshaw, human rights partner at Leigh Day, said: “The updated policy introduced by Manchester City applies a blanket requirement for personal attendance which significantly disadvantages a number of protected groups under the Equality Act. There is no indication that any meaningful mitigation procedures are in place. It disadvantages those working-class fans who are required to work shift patterns or precariously and may be unable to attend games for fear of losing their jobs.” City did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityDisabilityFootball ticket pricesnewsShareReuse this content"

The Netherlands midfielder has arrived from Milan for €55m (£46.6m) and joinsRayan Aït-Nouri, Marcus Bettinelli andRayan Cherkiat the club.All four will be available for the Club World Cup, with City’s first match against Wydad AC taking place next Wednesday, after Reijnders signed before Tuesday’s deadline.Reijnders has a five-year deal as Pep Guardiola revitalises his squad after an underwhelming season by the club’s standards, finishing a distant third in the Premier League and collecting no silverware thus far. City were also active in the January window, spending more than £180m on four players. Their outlay in 2025 stands at £288m.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreReijnders said: “City are one of the biggest teams in the world, with the best coach, world-class players and outstanding facilities. Under Pep Guardiola, City have won so many titles and I want to help keep that going with a lot more success in the coming years.“It is also a dream come true to play in the Premier League. This league has seen many of the best Dutch players perform through the years and it’s an inspiration to follow in their footsteps.”While the new signings are going to the Club World Cup, Jack Grealish was left out of City’s 27-man squad for the tournament on Wednesday. The 29-year-old’s omission had been widely anticipated and will raise further doubts over his future at the club, with an exit this summer likely.There has also been a reshuffle off the pitch with City appointing the ­former Liverpool assistant head coach Pepijn Lijnders to Guardiola’s staff and taking James French, an analyst at Anfield for more than a decade, as a set-piece coach.City’s director of football, Hugo Viana, said of Reijnders: “He arrives here with extensive top-level experience in Europe, both at club level as well as on the international stage with the Netherlands.

It is an interesting question but the former West Ham manager’s short time in charge in 2016, not long after Ray Wilkins had the job, is not a subject anyone in the capital, Amman, is much focused on at the moment.“Redknapp and Wilkins? Now is not the time to talk about that,” said a smilingJordanFootball Association official on Monday. The reaction given the country has just qualified for a first World Cup and is in serious party mode is understandable.Socceroos taken from brink of disaster to automatic World Cup 2026 qualification | Joey LynchRead moreBefore Tuesday’s game at home to Iraq the sky above Amman’s International Stadium came alive with drones displaying images of King Abdullah II, crown prince Al-Hussein bin Abdullah II and then a fighter jet, a tank and “2026”. It was impressive, and it is doubtful many of those present were also contemplating an image of Redknapp driving away from Jordan’s training, winding down the windows to chat about the World Cup with waiting journalists before turning past the shisha bars and restaurants on Al Shahid Street and heading back to his hotel.In March 2016, Redknapp was brought in for two World Cup qualifiers against Bangladesh and Australia. It was a short-lived rollercoaster, more of a gyro drop really, an 8-0 win followed by a 5-1 loss. There cannot be many international coaches with a higher goals per game average. Redknapp wanted to extend his contract if the team reached the third round of qualification but Jordan were fifth of the eight best group runners-up and only the top four went through. These days, they would be in the final stage.Wilkins had been appointed in September 2014, taking his former Manchester United teammate Frank Stapleton with him. His five-month contract was not extended after Jordan did not make it out of their group at the Asian Cup the following January, finishing third behind Japan and a talented Iraq team. A year later Redknapp followed.View image in fullscreenHarry Redknapp briefly managed Jordan in 2016 and one of his opponents was Australia, led by Ange Postecoglou.Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP/Getty ImagesHiring English coaches was the doing of the Jordan FA president, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, who challenged Sepp Blatter for the Fifa presidency in 2015. None of it really worked out. Wilkins and Redknapp were not around long enough to do much. “I haven’t got a magic wand. I can’t come here and suddenly go: ‘We’re going to play like Brazil,’” Redknapp said. “If I can get another 5% to make the difference I’ll be delighted.”He was right. There isn’t a magic wand and although the expanded World Cup helps, Jordan’s qualification is not all about that either. “This achievement comes after years of hard work from players and the Jordan FA,” said the team’s Moroccan coach, Jamal Sellami. “This historic qualification is for all the people who believed in us.”The improvement has been slow and steady. A solid mid-ranking team that long enjoyed being a stubborn underdog and giving more illustrious opponents a bloody nose in Amman have become something more. The 2023 Asian Cup was testament to that. Jordan won their first knockout games at the tournament and outclassed Jürgen Klinsmann’s South Korea in the semi-final before losing to the hosts, Qatar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The FA appointed the Moroccan in June 2023 instead of looking to Europe. He had a fine résumé, if one little known outside the Arab world, having secured continental prizes at club and country level as well as domestic trophies. Under him Jordan were happy to let opponents have possession and ready to take advantage of mistakes and be devastating on the counter. Attackers such as Yazan al-Naimat and Rennes’ Musa al-Tamari, a rare Europe-based player, though that may change soon, lit up the tournament.Ammouta left in June 2024, citing family reasons, and there was some annoyance when he was appointed by the UAE club Al Jazira a few weeks later and much stronger feelings when it looked as if he might take the Iraq job in April. This was not only down to rivalry but also because the two were fighting it out for the second 2026 World Cup automatic qualification spot in Group B behind South Korea. Ammouta decided against it.His successor, Sellami, sealed the deal last week with a 3-0 win in Oman. Five days later, Iraq came to town for the final group game, a dead rubber. The party was alive, flags flying from cars heading to the stadium, billboards showing congratulations and fans talking of who they want at the World Cup. Brazil, Portugal, Argentina and Spain were mentioned.England were high on the list too and, if it happens, then it will be a perfect time to talk about Redknapp, Wilkins and their Amman adventure.Explore more on these topicsJordanWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld Cup 2026Harry RedknappfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But they are Turkey’s greatest runners-up: they’ve assumed the position 30 times overall, 26 since the introduction of the Süper Lig in 1959.

The bigger the number, the sadder the heart.To satisfy the sample size mafia, of which The Knowledge is an unashamed member, we’ve produced two different lists. (Well, there are three but we’ll get to the third one later.) The first is for the heavyweight contenders, the teams in double figures for both first and second-place finishes. The second is a free-for-all.View image in fullscreenReal Madrid lost the league on the last day of the 1992-93 season in Tenerife.Photograph: Album/AlamyOf the heavyweights,Zamalekhave the most consistent hard-luck story.

But the longer answer is worth sticking around for because Pete Tomlin and Robbie Dale have done sterling work in the name of trivia.“Having trawled through every season of every European competition,” begins Pete, and let’s just pause to consider how much work that entailed, “I am confident that no side has ever achieved this feat.

Had City gone through they would have playedRomain the semi-finals, which would have completed the Beautiful South set.”Though the question was about clubs, one member of that Liverpool side managed to complete the sequence. “Had a long conversation about music with my plumber, a former drummer, this morning, and we were sharing our admiration for Paul Heaton,” writes Robbie Dale. “So I felt compelled to answer this when I read it.View image in fullscreenLeroy Sané of Manchester City is challenged by Georginio Wijnaldum of Liverpool in the Champions League in April 2018.Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images“Georginio Wijnaldumstarted his career at Feyenoord, then played for PSV Eindhoven and Newcastle (anywhere).

Cameroon forwardJoseph-Désiré Job, once of Middlesbrough, won the Africa Cup of Nations in 2000 and the AFC Champions League with Al-Ittihad in 2005. By that stage he already had won a European competition during his time in France with Lyon. Alas it wasn’t the big one, or even a medium one: Lyon joined Bastia and Auxerre as Intertoto Cup winners in 1997. A hat-trick for French football, but no triple crown for Job.Knowledge archive“Watching Arsenal thump Wigan at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday, I noticed that Chris Kirkland was wearing a cap,”said Gunther Lindleyin 2009.“Have there ever been any high-profile outfield players who preferred to wear a cap while playing? Would this even be legal?”Stuart Gardner pointed out that this has been answered inYou are the Ref, in which the referees’ chief Keith Hackett confirmed that, even if the cap fits, you’re not allowed to wear it.Tell the player to remove the cap or leave the pitch: it does not conform to the laws of the game. Goalkeepers have been allowed to wear caps of various designs for many years: remember Bert Trautmann?Yet it seems that players are permitted to wear other forms of headgear. Take the Petr Cech-style skull cap, which hasalso been sported by the Charlton centre-back Miguel Llera. Such protection was also seen on the Irish internationalTommy Priestley, who played for Chelsea in the 1930s but our own Paul Doyle explained that Priestley did not wear it to protect his skull but tocover his baldness.Other examples include Bury’sEfe Sodje,who wore a bandana matching his kit for more than a decade, Marseille’sKarim Ziani,Severino Varelaand theIran women’s team. Perhaps the best of all came from Algy Taylor. “In a famous incident (among Villa fans) in a league match in 1901, Aston Villa played Sheffield United in atrocious conditions, with players on both sides suffering from frostbite,” he said. “Villa’s legendary winger and England internationalCharlie Athersmithborrowed an umbrella from one of the spectators. Such was the awesomeness of the man that he even scored a goal with umbrella in hand.” And to think some people say old football was rubbish.Knowledge archiveCan you help?“Spurs sacked Ange Postecoglou on Friday, seven days after their parade to celebrate winning the Europa League.

The SER will be calculated using their average ranking during a 12-week period before and during their absence and can be used up to WTA 500 events.Raducanu and Boulter laugh off Queen’s doubles defeat with singles to comeRead moreA growing number of players are opting to take time away from the sport in order to give birth or actively plan their families during their careers. At the urging of the players, over the past few years the WTA has taken significant steps towards addressing these issues, helping to provide players with options to plan their families while competing at the highest level.Earlier this year, the organisation announced that it would offer players paid maternity leave. Those who take time away from the tour to give birth are also able to use their previous ranking to enter 12 tournaments over three years from the birth of their child.Sloane Stephens, the 2017 US Open champion, has twice used the short tennis off-season to freeze her eggs. “During my first retrieval cycle, I ended up gaining around 20lb due to hormones and taking a break from training that, going forward, I would be more aware of and plan differently for my next cycle this off-season,” the Americantold Essence last year.“It is also important to rest and not over-exert yourself, at the risk of developing ovarian torsion or other complications, so I had to really plan out my training blocks and off-season to make it all happen. Because of this, I am really passionate about introducing protected rankings for players undergoing fertility treatments so that they can feel supported in making decisions for themselves and properly caring for their bodies without rushing back out of fear of ranking points or career setbacks. “In a statement on Wednesday, Stephens hailed the WTA’s new ruling: “I’m incredibly proud of our sport in recognising the importance of fertility treatments for female athletes. For any woman, the conversation of family life versus a career is nuanced and complex. The WTA has now created a safe space for players to explore options and to make the best decisions for themselves. It’s truly groundbreaking and will empower this generation, and future generations of players, to continue with the sport they love without having to compromise.”Explore more on these topicsTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

It helps to have a bowler with the qualities of Rabada, who claimed five for 51, but Bavuma still shuffled his pack shrewdly.And yet by the close Bavuma found himself clinging on for dear life amid a clatter of wickets, reaching three not out after taking 31 balls to simply get off the mark. It was tough going out there, Mitchell Starc wiping out both openers, Pat Cummins castling the makeshift No 3 Wiaan Mulder and Josh Hazlewood doing the same to Tristan Stubbs. Bavuma will resume alongside David Bedingham on day two, the pair tasked with chiselling away at what is now a daunting 169-run deficit.Fair play to Australia, Bavuma might be forgiven for thinking, they just keep coming. Even with Rabada in such a rich groove, and the wiry Marco Jansen providing a left-arm counterpoint for figures of three for 49, a competitive total was still somehow achieved. There is a reason this lot keep winning trophies.Here it owed plenty to 6ft 6in Webster, who rode his luck at times, plus the latest chapter in Steve Smith’s love affair with Lord’s. Making 66, and supporting the notion his mojo has very much returned, Australia’s master moved to 591 career runs at the ground – the most by any visitor in Test history and having gone past Don Bradman (551), Garry Sobers (571) and Warren Bardsley (575) en oute.View image in fullscreenSteve Smith reached 591 career runs at Lord’s – the most by any visiting batsman in Test history, surpassing Bradman, Sobers and Bardsley.Photograph: Ashley Western/Colorsport/ShutterstockRabada has a penchant for the place too, this his second appearance on the honours boards. Despite hailing from Johannesburg, 8,000 miles south of St John’s Wood, he almost feels born to bowl from the Nursery End. And once the smoke cleared from the pre-match pyrotechnics, the 30-year-old set about showing this with a probing burst of wobble-seam that reduced Australia to 67 for four by lunch.There was plenty in South Africa’s favour when Bavuma won the toss, be it the blanket of cloud cover, the floodlights at full beam or the 10.30am start to suit overseas audiences. But all this still needed harnessing and Bavuma also knew that the sun would eventually break through as the ball got older.It also helped that Australia’s top order had been reshuffled to accommodate Cameron Green and is still yet to replace the aggression of the retired David Warner. Usman Khawaja fell for a painstaking duck that lasted 20 balls, while Green’s first foray at No 3 came and went in the very same over. Rabada was the man to strike twice courtesy of some sublime catching in the cordon.Marnus Labuschagne was watching all this unfold from the other end, with his first stab at opening not exactly exuding permanence either. In the end, having chiselled his way to 17, Labuschagne was the first of two wickets for Jansen that made it South Africa’s morning. He nibbled at one outside off stump, before Travis Head, man of the final two years ago, was strangled down leg for 11.View image in fullscreenKagiso Rabada acknowledges the crowd after taking five for 51 at Lord’s.Photograph: Alex Davidson/ICC/Getty ImagesThis brought the first of Australia’s fightbacks on the day, Webster joining the already encamped Smith after the restart and stitching together a stand worth 79 runs.In the end it took a stroke of fortune to prise out Smith, Bavuma introducing the part-time spin of Aiden Markram to facilitate a change of ends for the metronomic Mulder and seeing a drive held with juggle at slip by Jansen.It was the one wicket to fall in a session that suggested runs were in fact on offer out there. But after Australia resumed on 190 for five, a collapse of five for 20 followed. Though sparked by Alex Carey missing a reverse sweep to Keshav Maharaj on 23, it was Rabada who took centre stage. A high-speed seamer did for Cummins, swing did for Webster. And after Jansen knocked over Nathan Lyon, the rearrangement of Starc’s stumps wrapped things up.But as Rabada basked in the afterglow of his feat and the turning of the page in his personal story, his colleagues wilted in reply. As well as a lack of aggression, full and straight was their undoing. Oh, and a trio of fast bowlers who have delivered a fair haul of silverware in their time and are seemingly not sated.Explore more on these topicsWorld Test ChampionshipAustralia cricket teamSouth Africa cricket teamCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

She has effortlessly dispatched similar balls thousands of times, but on game point while a set down, her forehand drive volley landed closer to the back fence than the court.Normally, she would react with frustration to such an easy miss on an important point. This, however, was only doubles. As she turned away and comically planted her palm on her face, she could not hide her smile.Katie Boulter, her doubles partner, laughed out loud.Emma Raducanu ‘locked in’ after straight-sets win at Queen’s ClubRead moreIt was that kind of day for Britain’s two best women’s tennis players as their enjoyable time at Queen’s was ended by Erin Routliffe and Lyudmyla Kichenok. The imperious first seeds closed them out 6-2, 7-5 despite a spirited fightback from the home pairing. Although they were outplayed, Boulter and Raducanu were smiling until the end.Two days after they secured a victory in their first match together, Boulter and Raducanu returned to a heaving court one, where the significant interest generated by their partnership was again not reflected in an appropriate court assignment. Instead of the 7,700 strong Andy Murray Arena, they played in front of a full crowd of 1,000, with thousands of interested fans unable to watch. Once again, it was not available for the BBC to broadcast. This is not the first time on either the WTA or ATP tours that broadcast contractual obligations have led to a high-profile doubles match being held on a smaller court.Those who were able to watch witnessed the immense skill demonstrated by Routliffe, a former doubles No 1 and 2023 US Open champion ranked No 3, and Kichenok, the reigning US Open doubles champion. They pounced on their opponents’ inexperience, with the imposing Routliffe dominating the net while Kichenok remained tidy on both the baseline and the net until the end. Impressively, Raducanu and Boulter fought back from a break down to make the second set a competitive tussle, but they were well beaten in the end.Even in an era where most top singles players do not take doubles seriously, Raducanu’s aversion has been interesting. Queen’s marks just her second doubles tournament and the first-round match against Wu Fang-hsien and Jiang Xinyu was her first doubles win. Having spent much of her young career struggling to stay fit, adding doubles to her load has not been a realistic option at times, but experiences like this may highlight the value of the discipline.Doubles allows players to sharpen other parts of their games – particularly their volleying, returning and serving – in match scenarios without the pressure of immediately trying to implement them in singles. It also just provides some levity and enjoyment in an otherwise bruising, gruelling sport, something Raducanu has struggled with. With the British team now a consistent contender in the Billie Jean King Cup, an established partnership between Boulter and Raducanu would be an asset.View image in fullscreenBritain’s Sonay Kartal was beaten in straight sets by Amanda Anisimova.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersAlthough this outing ended in defeat, Wednesday was still a good day for both players. After a little over an hour of sharpening their games under match conditions and with ample laughs, they left the court more prepared for their significant challenges. On Thursday, Raducanu will attempt to maintain her momentum after her opening-round win over Cristina Bucsa by tackling Rebecca Sramkova of Slovakia. Boulter, meanwhile, will face the 21-year-old world No 10 Diana Shnaider.Later on Wednesday, Sonay Kartal, the British No 3, lost 6-1, 6-3 to the No 8 seed Amanda Anisimova. Kartal had achieved the biggest win of her career in the first round, beating world No 16 Daria Kasatkina in three sets, but here she was overpowered by the stellar American.Explore more on these topicsTennisEmma RaducanuKatie BoulternewsShareReuse this content"

The 25-year-old Belgian tasted Olympic gold in the discipline last year and is also the doubletime-trial world champion. He showed his pedigree by blowing away a field containing Jonas Vingegaard and Tadej Pogacar.Evenpoel raced home 21 seconds ahead of Vingegaard, with Matteo Jorgenson a further 17 seconds back in third. Pogacar just missed the podium at 49 seconds behind Evenepoel, with Florian Lipowitz fifth and Mathieu van der Poel sixth.‘They named a sandwich after me’: Luke Rowe on life in the peloton, cobbles and Welsh ridersRead more“I’m surprised with the gaps,” Evenepoel said. “It’s quite big on a short TT so I’m very happy to have put over a second per kilometre on everybody and even two seconds per kilometre on some. I’m feeling good and it’s always nice to bring home a World Tour victory.”Evenepoel now slips on the leader’s yellow jersey for the 77th edition of the Dauphiné, which will be decided in the last three stages in the Alps from Friday. His win was the 1,000th victory for his Soudal Quick-Step team, created in 2003 by Patrick Lefevere under the name Quick Step-Davitamon. “I’m very happy with this victory,” Evenepoel said. “It’s a special day, I’m very proud to have done it.”Of the three frontrunners for the overall win, Pogacar finds himself the least well placed. Although the overall classification is far from set, the Slovenian is in eighth place, 38 seconds behind Evenepoel, while Vingegaard is 16 seconds back in fifth.Thursday’s stage five is a hilly 183km run from Saint-Priest to Mâcon.Explore more on these topicsCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

He and Jamie George – another called up for the week in the Algarve – are among 24 players at Andy Farrell’s disposal with Bath, Leicester, Leinster and Toulouse players focused on club commitments.The Lions forwards coach, John Dalziel, delivered positive news on Duhan van der Merwe, Huw Jones and Mack Hansen, who have been injured recently, and was quick to allay fears over Furlong. Farrell was expected to select the team to face Argentina from the 24 in Portugal, but Dalziel was adamant that club finalists will be considered. “Tadhg has the availability to be able to train and play this week with Leinster,” he said.“There are no real concerns in terms of his ability to come back to full training. Tadhg had returned to play and was playing. He’s now being modified in terms of [being] off-feet in the last few weeks. We’ve got no real concerns [around] when he comes back to full training and playing.“We will put our best team and our best foot forward for Argentina, with everybody available the squad will be together on Sunday, everybody in after the finals, then we will select and prepare that team that week. We will get some structures in place here, some language and some learning with the wider group, then we will arrive back in Dublin on Sunday with everyone and prepare for Argentina.”View image in fullscreenJoseph Suaalii is recovering from a broken jaw.Photograph: Matt King/Getty for Rugby AustraliaDalziel also revealed that Fagerson, who touredSouth Africa with the Lions in 2021, may return to the squad when fit. “He’ll become available at the right time and when he’s ready should we need him again. His injury isn’t long term. I think it’s three or four weeks. It’s a setback. He’s looking to try and get through that. As soon as he gets the tick off, he’ll be available to come back into the squad should needs must.”The Lions arrived in Portugal on Tuesday after convening in Dublin the day before and after a high-octane gym session at the Campus resort on Wednesday, Farrell will run the rule over his players with two training sessions on Thursday and Friday. During their free time, players have been kept entertained by the golf courses and padel courts while Henry Pollock is now in official possession of BiL, the Lions’ mascot, traditionally the responsibility of the youngest member of the squad.

Everyone has their own personality, but it’s excellent to see guys you’ve previewed, and have been a thorn in your side, you can use them now.”Meanwhile, Australia’s star turn Joseph Suaalii has declared himself fit for the series after recovering from a broken jaw. The 21-year-old signing from rugby league – who starred on his debut against England at Twickenham last November – was injured last month. “My face was really big for a bit, I was wearing a face mask everywhere,” he said. “It’s such an important time for myself and Australian rugby and I want to be playing, so obviously I was a little bit of nerves but … I had surgery maybe three weeks ago now and looking good going into the Lions.”England have called Henry Arundell into camp this week as they prepare for a clash with a France XV at Twickenham on Saturday week before a tour of Argentina and the US.

Tuchel admitted his mother sometimes had “mixed emotions” when watching Bellingham play.Eberechi Eze offers England’s brightest spark amid end-of-season gloom | Jonathan LiewRead moreBut Tuchel made plain that he would count on the Real Madrid midfielder in his mission to win the World Cup next summer and that it was vital to harness the fires that rage within the 21-year-old on the pitch.“Jude has a certain something,” Tuchel said in an interview with TalkSport. “He brings an edge, which we welcome and which is needed if we want to achieve big things. The edge needs to be channelled towards the opponent, towards our goal and not to intimidate teammates or to be overaggressive towards teammates or referees.“He has the fire. I don’t want to dim this down. But the fire comes also with some attributes that can intimidate you. Maybe even as a teammate. And you see sometimes the explosion towards referees and the anger in his game. If he can channel this in the right way and we can help him in this, then for sure he has something that we need. He has a certain edge that is hard to find.”Tuchel described Bellingham as a “nice kid, very open, very intelligent and very easy so far [to manage]”. He added: “I can see that it [Bellingham’s edge] can create mixed emotions. I see this with my parents, with my mum, that she sometimes cannot see the nice and well-educated and well-behaved guy that I see and the smile.“If he smiles, he wins everyone but sometimes you see the rage, the hunger and the fire and it comes out in a way that can be a bit repulsive. For example, for my mother when she sits in front of the TV. I see that. But in general, we are very happy to have him. He’s a special boy.”Tuchel has thought about whether to try Bellingham as one of the strikers in a 4-4-2, although he has yet to do so. He started him as a No 10 on Saturday in the 1-0 World Cup qualifyingwin against Andorrain Barcelona and brought him off the bench as a No 8 in Tuesday’s 3-1 friendlydefeat against Senegalin Nottingham.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel says says No 10 may be Jude Bellingham’s best position.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images“From outside I thought for many years that Jude could be a 6/8,” Tuchel said. “Then he had this amazing season [in 2023-24] where he played like a false 9 in Real Madrid and scored and scored, and was involved in chances. I see still this hunger … the determination that he has to be on the scoreboard. I see [in him] what I normally see only in strikers. I think at the moment he’s more an 8/10 than a 6/8. Maybe a 10.”Tuchel has raised the possibility that Bellingham could play alongside his younger brother, Jobe, for England – something Bellingham has called “the biggest dream of my life … that would mean more than any of the trophies”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The answer isn’t necessarily ‘no’Aaron TimmsMen’s and women’s leagues have announced plans for rapid growth. But secession and expansion have long been central elements of US sportsWed 11 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 13.19 EDTShareBetween this summer’s Club World Cup, next year’s World Cup, the enduring stature of the US women’s national team, and MLS’s steadily growing stable of teams and star attractions, soccer finally appears to be realizing its vast promise on US soil. Is there a limit to how much soccer America can handle? Several organizations are betting that the answer to that question is “no”. In late April, the National Women’s Soccer League – the oldest and biggest first division professional women’s league operating in the US today –announcedplans to launch a second division, despiteconcernsover the first division’s financial sustainability and the NWSL’s slipping status in a women’s club gameincreasingly dominated by Europe.That announcement came on the heels of news that the Women’s Premier Soccer League, the longest-running active women’s soccer league in the country,plansto launch WPSL Pro as a second-tier league late next year. Meanwhile the USL Super League, a first division rival to the more established NWSL,launchedwith eight teams in 2024; Sporting Club Jacksonville will become the league’s ninth team when the second season starts this fall. There is nothing in the US Soccer Federation’s rules to prevent multiple leagues from occupying the same division. From a single Division I competition two years ago, professional US women’s soccer is now facing a future where it could very soon have two rival leagues at both first and second division level. Should all the proposed leagues launch as planned, there could be 50 women’s professional soccer teams in the US by 2030. In 2023 there were just 12.US-based soccer fans: are you going to a Club World Cup game this summer?Read moreThe emerging patchwork of leagues, officiating bodies, and teams in US women’s soccer can be bewildering to contemplate; keeping track of the growing family of acronyms alone – NWSL, WPSL, WPSL Pro, USL, and how they all relate to each other – is enough to induce a headache. But it’s not only in the women’s game that this kind of divisional competition is flourishing. In February the United Soccer League – the same USL behind the women’s USL Super League –announcedplans to launch a Division I men’s league to rival MLS by 2027. This announcement came just a few days after a jurydismisseda civil anti-trust action brought by a former Division I rival, the now defunct North American Soccer League, against US Soccer and MLS over what it alleged was an unlawful scheme to curb competition in top tier men’s professional soccer. Right when MLS imagined it might finally be clear of the threat posed by former and would-be rivals, USL – which already operates second and third division men’s professional leagues – popped up to spoil the party.With its vast media market, love of sports, cultural heft, and unquenchable thirst for consumption, America has long loomed as global soccer’s white whale. But how much growth is too much? Excitement, innovation, expanding access to the sport, and giving fanschoice: these are all, of course, the regular platitudes that accompany the announcement of new leagues, and this latest flurry of divisional growth in US soccer has been no different. “By uniting people through soccer and bringing Division One to more cities, we’re not just growing the sport – we’re creating lasting opportunities while building a more sustainable and vibrant soccer ecosystem in the US,”arguedCEO Alec Papadakis in announcing USL’s plans for the first division league.Unquestionably the US market presents a massive opportunity for soccer, even with all the obvious progress made over the past few decades, and in principle, assuming the startups meet all the customary financing criteria, there’s nothing to hold the expansion in leagues and teams back. US Soccer’s professional league standards – the requirements that leagues must meet in order to be officially sanctioned –spell things outclearly. All Division I men’s competitions, for instance, must have at least 12 teams to apply (and 14 by year three); every stadium should have a minimum capacity of 15,000; and at least 75% of the league’s teams have to play in metropolitan markets of at least one million people. Compare those metrics to America’s raw demographic data and it seems obvious that the US market can support way more than the 30 men’s Division I teams currently competing in MLS: there are more than 50 metropolitan statistical areas in America with more than one million inhabitants, and at least 11 of them pass the five million mark. This suggests a vast consumer reservoir just waiting to be tapped.The history of America’s sporting experience points in a slightly less bullish direction: across the NFL, NBA, andMLS, leagues that have been around for much longer than MLS and are far more mature in their segmentation and capturing of distinct fandoms and consumer markets, it’s rare for cities to have more than one team, and even the country’s biggest agglomerations like LA and New York have no more than two home franchises in a single sport. Both MLS and NBA have 30 teams, while the NFL has 32; however confident commissioner Don Garber might sound in the league’s prospects, MLS on its own may already be approaching the ceiling of its development and expansion in this country, and that’s before we even consider the impact that new entrants like the USL will have on the incumbent’s vitals. Yes, there is room for soccer to grow in the US, but it seems unlikely the sport can grow this much this quickly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The NWSL is expanding healthily: the league will welcome its 15th and 16th teams, from Boston and Denver, next year, and a recently inked $240m, four-year media rights deal with ESPN represents a powerful boost in TV revenue. But these encouraging signs can’t conceal the very real cultural troubles the league has had in recent years: most notably, a series of investigations in 2022 found that verbal, emotional, and sexual abuse was widespread and systematic throughout the NWSL, and a $5m restitution fund has now beenestablishedto compensate players affected.Meanwhile the competitive threat posed by the European leagues, which are coming to be seen as the pinnacle of the women’s game at club level after years of lagging America, continues to grow, causing jitters at the top levels of a league used to setting the global benchmark. In a bid to stay competitive with Europe and the upstart USL Super League, where there’s no player draft and free agency rules, the NWSL and its player association last year agreed on a new collective bargaining agreement to eliminate its draft, raise the salary cap, and free other restrictions on player movement. The question now is whether the league’s new era of spending can be sustainable – especially in an environment where many franchises aren’t profitable, salary creep outstrips income growth, and an exodus of top talent to Europe means teams are overpaying for a more mediocre on-field product. As one general managerput itto ESPN last year: “I think this league is growing too fast.” How can a competition facing headwinds and challenges like these credibly claim to be ready to stand up a second division?Whether all of these leagues can survive together may ultimately be the wrong way of looking at things – and not just because they almost certainly can’t. The story of professional sports over the last century or so is a tale of secession, insurrection, absorption, and consolidation, and the US, with its staunch tradition of anti-trust law and openness to commercial competition, has been a breeding ground for breakways and upstarts. The NFL, to take the most obvious example, matured through the competitive energies stoked by rival leagues like the AAFC of the postwar era and the AFL, which rose to become the NFL’s primary competitor in the 1960s; eventually the AFL and the NFL merged, creating the NFL as we know it today. In the decades since, the NFL has faced periodic challenges to its supremacy, most infamously fromthe Donald Trump-aligned USFL in the 1980s, but it has seen off all competitors with relative ease; it’s fair to speculate that the NFL might not be quite so hegemonic today had it not been hardened through battle. The real benefit of the upstart leagues may be to make the incumbents stronger.Can they also make the incumbents better? The challenge posed by the European leagues and the USL has already pushed the NWSL to abandon the player draft, which has been one of American soccer’s defining features in the era of professionalization. Whether this is a good thing or not remains to be seen – league parity, after all, is one of the great historic strengths ofUS sports– but it’s possible that this latest blossoming of league rivals could push sometimes recalcitrant incumbents to embrace long-resisted changes. The USL Super League, for example, runs a fall-to-spring season calendar that makes it an outlier in the US but aligns it with Europe – and could eventually become an example to emulate for the NWSL. In the men’s game, the USL’s plans to launch a first division competition put it firmly in line to run a three-tier professional pyramid with relegation and promotion. Could this push MLS, traditionally a bastion of resistance to pro-rel, to embrace a multi-divisional future? Or will these threats, combined, push MLS and the NWSL to overreach, spending and growing beyond their means in a rush to stay at the top of the sport?Rebellion, secession, conquest, and expansion have long been central elements of the American experience. Now these themes are set to play out across US soccer, and the results promise to be every bit as unpredictable asthe sputtering American experiment.Explore more on these topicsFootballMLSUSL ChampionshipNWSLUS sportsWomen's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

Going into their Concacaf Gold Cup opener against Trinidad and Tobago on Sunday, the Americans are 5-5 underMauricio Pochettino, who took over after his predecessor, Gregg Berhalter, was fired after the team’s first-round elimination at last year’s Copa América.Ndoye burst behind Nate Harriel to run on to a through ball for the first goal; Manzambi dribbled past Max Arfsten along the endline to leave Aebischer with a tap-in for the second; goalkeeper Matt Turner spilled Ricardo Rodriguez’s shot to leave Embolo an open net for the third; and a mix-up when Quinn Sullivan passed to Sebastian Berhalter as the former coach’s son slipped created a giveaway that led to Manzambi’s first international goal.In mitigation, the Americans were missing a number of key players, including Christian Pulisic, Yunus Musah, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Gio Reyna, Antonee Robinson, Tyler Adams, Folarin Balogun and Sergiño Dest.Turner played his first game for club or country since 23 March. Berhalter started in his debut, and Brenden and Paxten Aaronson became the fourth set of brothers to start for the US, and the first since George and Louis Nanchoff in 1979.Pochettino made nine changes from Saturday’s 2-1 loss to Turkey, keeping only Arfsten and midfielder Johnny Cardoso.

Currently AI cannot reach the same level as humans in all tasks, a state known as artificial general intelligence (AGI). Recent studies have shown thatmany mainstream systems collapse when presented with highly complex puzzles.Meta’s attempt to leapfrog the current state of progress and target superintelligence is seen by observers as an attempt by the company to regain the initiative over AI after significant advances by competitors including Sam Altman’s OpenAI and Google and after Meta’s huge investment in the concept of the Metaverse flopped.In March,Wang, 28, signed a deal to build a US defence department systemcalled ThunderForge to apply AI to US military planning and operations, starting with the Indo-Pacific and European commands. The company also received early investment from Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.The move by Meta has led to fresh calls for European governments to launch their own more transparent research push that would ensure that the technology was developed robustly while maintaining public trust – an AI equivalent of the Cern European Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland.Michael Wooldridge, a professor of the foundations of artificial intelligence at the University of Oxford, said: “There’s a good argument that there should be a Cern for AI where governments collaborate to develop AI openly and robustly so we understand and trust the technology we are developing. That’s not going to happen if it’s developed behind closed doors. [AI] seems just as important as Cern and particle accelerators.”Wooldridge said the reported deal “seems very much like an attempt by Meta to regain the initiative after the Metaverse didn’t take off. They invested spectacular amounts in that and it didn’t just fail, it was ridiculed.”But he said the state of AI development was patchy and that AGI is still far away, never mind “superintelligence”.“We have AI that can do genuinely impressive things but then it fails on an absolutely simple task which any competent GCSE student wouldn’t fail,” he said.Dr Andrew Rogoyski, the director of partnerships and innovation at the Institute for People-Centred AI at Surrey University, said the deal would be “a reflection that the AI companies are hoovering up AI talent from wherever they can get it, whether acquiring young AI companies, or hollowing out university AI departments”.He said that Meta’s strategy for AI was different from the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic in that AI is an enabler for Meta’s business rather than its core purpose.“It means they’re not quite as desperate to achieve AGI, so they can afford to take a longer view,” he said.It was reported that Wang will take a senior position in Meta.Meta declined to comment. Scale AI has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingMetaMark ZuckerbergnewsShareReuse this content"

She appealed to their universal humanity and urged them to stand against Microsoft’s contracts to provide cloud computing software andartificial intelligenceproducts to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).She sent the second to the “Muslims at Microsoft” email list. Its subject line read: “Muslims ofMicrosoft, Our Code Kills Palestinians.”With her email, Aboussad told the Guardian, she wanted Muslim staff of companies such asMicrosoft,Google and Amazonto stop regarding the question of whether they organize against their employer’s work with the IDF as an issue of secular or professional ethics. It was a question of Islam, of their faith, she argued.“I wanted to say, ‘Hey, remember, yourrizq[livelihood] is from Allah,’” Aboussad said. “It should be clean, and you cannot be contributing to oppression.”There’s been protests within American tech companies against their contracts with Israel and its military since the start of the war in Gaza. There have been walkouts and vigils. Offices have been taken over and op-eds have been written. Some staff have resigned and some have been fired for their activism.But as the war endures and Palestinians in Gaza are being starved, forcibly displaced and killed, and the contracts have survived, there’s a growing group of Muslim staffers who are unsure whether they can religiously justify working at companies that they view as effectively defense contractors.View image in fullscreenIbtihal Aboussad participates in a protest in Seattle on 4 April 2025.Photograph: No Azure for ApartheidThe Guardian spoke with nearly a dozen Muslim employees of major tech companies who’ve been grappling with the question, many of whom asked not to be named for fear of professional repercussions or because they are continuing to organize inside the companies.Several of the staffers have resigned or are in the process of resigning. Some said they aren’t convinced that their employers have crossed a line that would force them to quit. Others worried that leaving the company would do more harm than good.Nearly all said that the public protest of Aboussad, and her co-demonstrator Vaniya Agrawal, has pressed the question. And at least for some, the footage of Aboussad – a hijab-clad young woman staring down Microsoft’s AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, and calling him a war profiteer – has been activating.Organizers at No Azure for Apartheid (NoAA), the worker-led group at Microsoft that Aboussad belongs to, and whose name refers to Microsoft’s cloud-computing platform, say that they’ve heard from more staffers looking to get involved with the group since Aboussad’s action. And they’ve heard from more than a dozen workers looking to resign or lodge a protest, and several more who have already done so.Others are on the fence, with some in a constant spiritual crisis over whether they should resign. The reasons vary: some feel they can do more to agitate against these contracts from inside the company, others worry about being able to provide for their families and some worry about trying to find another tech job in a tough market.“Honestly, I’ve been praying about what Allah wants me to do,” one Microsoft employee said. “Because it doesn’t seem like it’s right for a Muslim to continue working for such companies. But if we leave, then there could be a pro-Israeli person who takes our spot, and then you’re not serving the cause by doing this.”OneGoogleworker said they decided it no longer feels halal to remain at the company. But their father doesn’t agree: he argues it’s their “Islamic duty” to stay at the company because the role was a blessing from God. “He said this is self-sabotage,” the worker said.View image in fullscreenMembers of No Azure for Apartheid hold a protest on 20 March 2025.Photograph: No Azure for Apartheid“My parents are like, ‘If you quit, how does that help the cause?’ I don’t think they understand that by quitting I am not trying to help the cause,” the Google staffer said. “I’m at a [spiritual and moral] negative right now. I’m just trying to go back to neutral. Every day my work is actively harming people. I can’t help people if I’m actively harming them.”The debate is not confined to the cafeterias of tech companies. Several tech workers said they have sought the spiritual insight of popular Islamic scholars, including Imam Omar Suleiman, the founding president of the Yaqeen Institute, a Texas-based Islamic research organization. Suleiman is actively engaging with Microsoft workers to help determine “if there’s any part of Microsoft that wouldn’t be considered complicit in this”, he said. The imam said he is still grappling with the question of whether and how urgently Muslims need to quit their tech jobs, leaving the workers to wrestle with it privately for now.“More fields of employment are complicated than not,” Suleiman said. “It’s not always as straightforward as someone that works at a liquor store. It’s someone that works at a grocery store [that sells alcohol].”Big tech’s rising role in the siege of GazaDetails of how big tech works with the IDF have long been murky, and many tech staffers had mostly accepted their employers’ denials or defenses of these contracts. But recently, evidence that the tech industry’s products have been used in Israel’s violent campaign in Gaza, which the UN has concluded is consistent with “the characteristics of genocide”, has been mounting.Microsoft deepened its ties with the Israeli military in the wake of Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attacks, according to a Guardianinvestigationreported in collaboration with +972 Magazine and Local Call, based in part on documents obtained by Drop Site News. Leaked documentsindicatedMicrosoft has a “footprint in all major military infrastructures” in Israel. The Associated Press has also reported that Microsoft technology has aided in Israel’ssurveillanceof Palestinians.Microsoft hasdefendedits contract with the IDF, saying that an internal investigation concluded the firm “found no evidence” that its technology was used by the IDF to target or harm people.Microsoft’s chief communications officer, Frank Shaw, reiterated those findings and said these reports “are not accurate”.“As we stated before in our blog, we have found no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza,” he said in a statement.View image in fullscreenHossam Nasr participates in a protest in 2024.Photograph: Courtesy of Hossam NasrThe company’s investigation did nothing to assuage workers. Hossam Nasr, an organizer with NoAA who was fired by Microsoft afterorganizing a vigilfor Palestinians in 2024, argued there is no way to have an “ethical” contract with a military “whose leaders are wanted by the international criminal court for war crimes”.Google andAmazonboth provide cloud services to the Israeli military and government under a $1.2bn agreement dubbed “Project Nimbus”.Google has maintained that its technology is not aimed at military work, but reporting suggests the tech giant providescloud services as well as advanced AI and machine learning toolsthat directly equip the Israeli military with various features including image and object detection and analysis. Google and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.‘If you do not organize, you must leave’Many of the tech workers the Guardian spoke with said the recent revelations about the depth of their employers’ work with the IDF and the lack of sufficient response to worker opposition to the contracts felt like a mask-off moment, one that left little doubt about their employers’ roles in Israel’s offensive and even less hope that the companies might stop working with the Israeli military.In April, the Boycott, Divest and Sanction (BDS) movement, which seeks to use economic means to protest Israel’s occupation and siege of thePalestinian territories, added Microsoft to its list of companies to boycott, further pressing the issue for many Muslim tech workers.It was ultimately these revelations that moved Aboussad to stage her protest at Microsoft’s 50th anniversary event in April. But there were other factors: in addition to becoming involved with NoAA in February 2025, Aboussad had also started wearing hijab at the end of 2023, and she felt a new responsibility as someone who was more visibly Muslim to represent her faith appropriately and stand in opposition to the company’s contract with the IDF.In her email to Muslim staff, she included an essay written by Hasan Ibraheem, one of severalGoogle workers firedfor occupying the company’s New York office the year before. The essay was meant to serve as a “dire callout to our community”, Aboussad wrote in the email.“To my Muslim brothers and sisters, I offer this essay as a sincere naseeha [advice],” Ibraheem’s essay began. Then he quoted from the prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him):“Whosoever of you sees an evil, let him change it with his hand; and if he is not able to do so, then with his tongue; and if he is not able to do so, then with his heart – and that is the weakest of faith.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Working at a company that contracts with the Israeli government as it continues its decimation of Gaza without doing anything to push back against those contracts was in violation of that obligation. Put bluntly, Muslims have two options, Ibraheem said: to either fight or quit.“If you do not organize, you must leave,” Ibraheem wrote. “And even if you organize, your goal should be to eventually leave. Organizing does not absolve you of complicity indefinitely.”View image in fullscreenHasan Ibraheem.Photograph: Ahmed Gaber/The Guardian“If you know that the company you work for is directly enabling harmful activities, then maybe your money is not completely halal,” Ibraheem said.Aboussad said that in the days after she protested in the meeting, she received dozens of direct messages on Instagram from other Muslim tech workers. Many said she inspired them to do more to oppose their company’s actions, and some said they were even thinking of resigning, Aboussad recalled. One person said her demonstration “removed any excuses” they might have made about not doing more to oppose their employers’ work with the IDF.One confrontation inspires multiple resignationsThe debates aren’t limited to the companies’ US offices. For some workers at Microsoft’s offices across the Middle East and north Africa, Aboussad and Agrawal’s protest was one of the first times they were confronted with the depth of their employers’ work with the Israeli military. For others, their concerns about their roles at the company had long been brewing. One worker, based out of Microsoft’s Cairo office, told the Guardian she had been weary for months of what she saw as a vehement pro-Israeli stance in Microsoft’s internal communications to employees and their lack of mention of the now more than 50,000 Palestinians who have been killed by the IDF.The first time she began to wonder whether she belonged at Microsoft as a Muslim was when the company fired Nasr and another worker after the two organized a vigil for Palestinians.Aboussad and Agrawal’s protest about six months later helped her answer that question, she said. Their demonstration prompted about 100 employees in the Cairo office to take a day off in protest of Microsoft’s work with Israel – an action that was just shy of striking, which is generally illegal in Egypt. On that day, she decided she would quit.“The response of [Suleyman] and [Microsoft CEO] Satya [Nadella] was very dismissive,” she said. “And I think Satya laughed, and that sort of made me feel like, no, I don’t think I belong here, and me staying here is just supporting what they’re doing.”None of the Google or Microsoft workers who spoke to the Guardian had any doubt about whether their employers were contributing to Israeli military operations. But some held out hope the company may switch strategies.One person who has worked at Microsoft for nearly a dozen years said they felt betrayed by the company, which sold them on its 2014 mission of “empowering every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more”. But they remain hopeful that internal pressure might force the company to change its policy on working with the Israeli government.“I know during South African apartheid, the company did flip to the right side,” they said, citing Microsoft’s decision to leave South Africa in 1986 in response to the country’s laws enforcing racial discrimination. “I hope that history repeats itself and they become the company where the culture is that you make everyone feel great.”Meanwhile, workers’ protests have continued. At Microsoft, NoAA hasdisruptedat least two more company events, prompting the company to fire at least one of the workers, Joe Lopez.Another staffer, senior UX designerJasmina Mathieu, resigned publicly, stating in an email to leadership and employees that she could no longer work at a company that directly or indirectly enables “horrific actions done by Israel”. Since then, the Microsoft staffers said, they can no longer send emails to anyone, including human resources, that contained the words “genocide”, “Gaza”, “Palestine” or even “Vaniya Agrawal”. One worker with NoAA, Nisrine Jaradat, was able to get around the block and send an email to all Microsoft staff decrying the policy that “utterly and completely discriminate[s] against an entire nation, an entire people, and an entire community”. Jaradat called on her co-workers to either organize against the company’s work with the IDF or quit.“If you choose to leave Microsoft to no longer be com​plicit in genocide do not go quietly,” Jaradat wrote.A popular imam fields the question: is working in big tech haram?Many workers have consulted with local religious leaders and scholars but have not been given a clear response. “We’ve been wanting to get an opinion that says, you know, ‘Just quit, you should not be working here,’ but we did not,” one Microsoft worker said. “They just say it depends on the situation.”Imam Omar Suleiman has been helping people figure out whether working at certain companies is halal or permissible for the entire 20 years he’s been a religious leader.Over the last two years, Muslims tech workers from around the country have reached out to Suleiman’s Yaqeen Institute with the same question: can I still work at a tech company that is helping power the Israeli military? For Suleiman, tech has been one of the hardest fields to navigate “because you have Muslims that work at various levels and tech companies are involved in this genocide to varying extents”, he said.View image in fullscreenA protester waves a Palestinian flag outside the Seattle Convention Center on 4 April 2025.Photograph: Andres Robles/No Azure for ApartheidWhat Suleiman and the Yaqeen Institute – where Aboussad now works – ultimately decide matters a great deal to tech workers of a certain age. The institute is well regarded among millennial Muslims in the US for its easy-to-digest content on how to understand and apply the teachings of the Qur’an. Suleiman’s videos have garnered him more than 3 million Instagram followers. Nearly every tech worker who the Guardian spoke to cited Suleiman’s speeches shared on social media as inspiration for why they want to leave Google or Microsoft. Yet for Suleiman, who recently gave animpassioned speech, orkhutbah, at a Virginia mosque urging congregants to “have some dignity” and quit their jobs at arms manufacturers, whether Islam requires that these tech workers leave their jobs with the same urgency is still an open question. Like Suleiman’s example of a clerk at a grocery store selling alcohol alongside fruits and vegetables, it is not as clearcut if coding productivity tools poses the same grave transgression as building a bomb.Suleiman and others at the Yaqeen Institute are working on developing a general framework that will help Muslims decide whether they can religiously justify working at any of the tech firms contracting with the IDF. That framework will be published as a resource for both local imams as well as individuals in the midst of a spiritual crisis about their jobs.Suleiman looks at cases from many different sides. Staff have to ask themselves personal questions. Islamic religious law advises all Muslims to leave something that causes them doubt for something that doesn’t. But, he cautions, many cases are complicated. You might be the primary breadwinner of your household, have an employer-sponsored visa or be working at a part of the company that you feel doesn’t have anything to do with the products the firm builds for militaries, such as LinkedIn. One also has to evaluate whether you’re having a positive impact by staying in the company.“There’s room for the person who holds back the hand of the pharaoh from inside the pharaoh’s court,” Suleiman said. “But they have to demonstrate how exactly [they are] minimizing that harm without at any point becoming a mouthpiece for oppression.”And they need to evaluate the workings of their companies, he said. Do they produce haram, or impermissible, products, like alcohol or weapons used to kill people? In those cases, “they need to leave their job and they need to find a different job depending on what layer they participate in and how much need they have”, Suleiman said. Or is the company based around usury or interest-based transactions, which are also impermissible in Islam? In those cases, you can still work at the company, but you should up your charity to offset those haram transactions.While Islamic jurisprudence has an established structure to make these decisions, Suleiman says tech remains a complicated matter to locate within that framework. The imam said he is still in the discovery phase on how the roles workers find themselves in at these companies align with their religious duty.“It’s very hard to compare something that’s just purely generating weapons of mass destruction and a tech company that has a wide array of businesses, but also happens to be manufacturing for a genocide,” he said. “It’s hard for me to figure out when that line disappears.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyIslamMicrosoftGoogleAlphabetAmazonIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They went too far.”Musk’s public apology came after the tech billionaire privately called Trump on Monday night, theNew York Times first reported, citing three people familiar with the matter.Musk’s call to Trump on Monday night followed a conversation he had on Friday with the vice-president,JD Vance, and the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, the New York Times reported. The three were said to have discussed the public feud during the call.The trio’s conversation on Friday came after Vance asked Trump how he would prefer to publicly address the feud, asource familiar with the matter told CNN. The source said Vance’s query to Trump came before an interview Vance was scheduled to do with Theo Von, a conservative podcast host.Trump told Vance to be diplomatic, CNN reports, citing the source. Duringthe podcast interview, which aired on Saturday, Vance said: “Really, man, I think it’s a huge mistake for him to go after the president like that … I actually think if Elon chilled out a little bit, everything would be fine.”Asked about the apparent apology, the president told the New York Post: “I thought it was very nice that he did that.” The comments came after the paper published a previously recorded interview, in which Trump had said “I guess I could” reconcile with Musk.The president said he “was not a happy camper” when theTeslachief executive launched last week’s tirade but claimed he had “no hard feelings for it”, adding: “I think he feels very badly, that he said that.”The possibility of a rapprochement – however superficial – appeared to be welcomed by investors. Tesla’s share price rose by 2.6% in pre-market trading.Unstoppable force loses battle with immovable object: Elon bows to TrumpRead moreThe public feud was one of the mostextraordinary turns in the relationshipbetween the two men. During the presidential campaign they had claimed to be ideological allies, and Musk briefly served in Trump’s government as head of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, a drive to slash government programmes nicknamed “Doge” afterthe internet meme. Experts have argued that thecost-cutting is illegal.Relations soured after Musk publicly criticised Trump’s “big beautiful bill”, saying it would add $2.4tn to US government borrowing andcalling it a “disgusting abomination”.Trump responded to Musk’s barrage of criticism by saying the tech billionaire “went crazy”. He also made direct references to Musk’s companies, highlighting the potential financial risks of the feud.In a direct reference to Tesla, Trump wrote on Truth Social, his own social media network: “I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted.” The electric car pioneer has been struggling withfalling sales in some markets, including much of Europe, in part, analysts say, because of Musk’s allegiance with Trump.Musk’s alignment with the US president had prompted a surge in the market value of Tesla, with investors hoping that the White House would look more favourably at the company’s autonomous driving technology. Musk’s retreat from the feud came a day before Tesla’s launch of a “robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas. That launch is seen as crucial for the company to justify its position as the world’s most valuable carmaker even as it struggles with an ageing lineup of products.Trump also threatened another of Musk’s key businesses, the rocket company SpaceX. Trump wrote: “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.”In practice the US government is unlikely to cancel SpaceX’s contracts, as it carries out more strategically important satellite launches than every other company in the world combined. Musk at first threatened to decommission SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft, the key vehicle to transport Nasa astronauts to the International Space Station, before withdrawing the threat.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskDonald TrumpTrump administrationTeslaUS politicsJD VancenewsShareReuse this content"

I was then told I wasn’t allowed in with a baby. I went to get my badge, but was then taken over to the organisers from Informa, who told me they weren’t insured. But they asked again if I was a VIP or speaker, and later another lady came over and twisted my badge around to see, clearly checking to see if I was a VIP.”The incident has caused outrage and cast a shadow over the event, which wasaddressed by the prime minister, Keir Starmer, on the day Schonle was turned away. The tech sector has been trying to move away from accusations of sexism and perceptions that it regards women as second class.Schonle said the experience had brought all her worst fears about being a woman in the sector into sharp focus. She is the founder and chief executive of Humanvantage AI, a startup developing a conversational role-play corporate training platform using AI technology.In a now widely sharedLinkedIn post, Schonle wrote: “This moment was more than inconvenient. It was a clear reminder that as a tech industry, we still have work to do when it comes to inclusion beyond buzzwords.“Parents are part of this ecosystem. Caregivers are innovators, founders, investors, and leaders. If major events like London Tech Week can’t make space for, what message does that send about who belongs in tech?

The complaints usually mourn a loss of innocence and freedom. They remember the way things used to be, before the digital world was conquered by a handful of infinitely powerful tech oligarchs.I remember when we first got broadband in 2005. I felt like one of F Scott Fitzgerald’s Dutch sailors at the end of The Great Gatsby, “face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder”.Janet Anderson: the 10 funniest things I have ever seen (on the internet)Read moreIt’s scary to think that this beautiful thing has been stolen and turned against us. Used to extract the very minutes of our lives, which are then sold for profit.Some think that we should switch it off, shut the whole thing down before we lose touch with what’s real, and who we are. But is it really so wrong to stay just a little bit longer?These are the 10 funniest things I have ever seen on the internet.1. Monster by Dylan MoranThis is the first standup special I ever remember watching. I always loved this bit about how hangovers get worse as you get older, which is so funny to me now because I’d never been drunk when I first saw this. Now I’m in my 30s, but I’ve been sober for six years, so you could argue that I still don’t really get it. But I love the bit now for the same reason I did when I was 13: the violent way he says “SHUT UP!”2. Wizard People, Dear Reader by Brad NeelyIn high school I was friends with these two brothers who lived on my street. Their dad was an illustrator and loved the Beatles and their mum would take car-loads of us out to the hills to film gory slasher movies that they wrote and produced together. They introduced me to so much indie film and weird art that felt a world away from suburban Adelaide and as weird as Brad Neely’s overdub of the entire first Harry Potter film is, it’s also just the tip of the iceberg. As an aside, one of the brothers, Pirie Martin, is a film-maker in his own right now and his first feature, Psychosis, was released in 2023 and absolutely rules.3.

James Donald Forbes McCann, as he insists on being referred to, was one of the best comedians in Australia for years and no one cared. Then he started opening for Shane Gillis and moved to the US, and now he rightfully sells tickets everywhere he goes. I could have just as easily put his“Fool Me Once”bit on this list, but I can’t go past this poem about the Beatles. It’s the age-old question: who is the best Beatle? For me, this poem settles it for good.4. Superfoods by Andrew PortelliAllow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

David QuirkWhen I moved to Melbourne in 2012, David Quirk was the first comic I ever shared a bill with whose work I was already familiar with. I loved this set from Festival Club and there is no better summary of what comedians do than his quip, “All I do is participate in life, and report back”. Watching Quirk emcee the open mic at The Monastery in Richmond to four punters in 2012 was an incredible thrill and also served as great preparation for how the next decade-plus of my life would look.8.

Be afraid – and excitedAlyssa MercanteWed 11 Jun 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 19.10 EDTShareA surprise announcement at the end of the 6 June Summer Game Fest presentation revealed the ninth entry in the iconic Capcom survival horror series:Resident EvilRequiem, coming early next year.Diehard fans of the series (which has spawned films, television shows and more) immediately began picking apart the trailer, which highlights protagonist Grace Ashcroft, the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft, featured in 2003’s Resident Evil Outbreak. Requiem appears to be set in Racoon City, the fictional location in the franchise that was famously nuked to try and stop the spread of the zombifying T-Virus.Game director Kōshi Nakanishi introduced the game at a demo in LA last week, saying that Requiem’s core theme is “addictive fear” and that Grace Ashcroft is a much more timid, fearful protagonist than the military-trained heroes of previous games.View image in fullscreenTop scarer … Resident Evil Requiem.Photograph: CapcomI heard reactions to the demo before I saw it (screams and shouts, mostly), and when it was my turn to enter a dark room with a few dozen other people, boy, did it freak me out. I think anyone would be fearful if they woke up hanging upside down from a gurney, with a needle in their arm regularly drawing blood into a massive glass container hanging nearby. That’s how this snippet ofResident Evil Requiemgameplay begins, and it’s hard not to wince in empathic pain as Grace tries to free herself from her restraints. She manages, however, and the game shifts from a cutscene into first-person play, offering a few options to examine items in the room, which looks like it’s in an abandoned hotel or hospital.As you’d expect, certain rooms have functioning electricity, but Grace is mainly in the dark, red emergency lights bathing everything in an eerie glow. She stumbles around, trying to find keys for locked doors and fuses to boot up breakers, all whilesomethingmoves about this spooky space with her. Just when it seems that Grace has the tools to escape whatever the hell this place is, she stumbles across a body. Before she can figure out whose it is, a disgusting, massive creature resembling the monster inBarbarianappears, with massive black eyes, huge ears, pointed teeth and hands that are far, far too large.The creature picks the body up and bites into its flesh, in a moment that feels like a one-to-one recreation of the famousGoya painting Saturn Devouring His Son.Goosebumps dance up my arms. We see this creature a few more times during the gameplay snippet, punctuated by screams from the players. At the very end, it seems like the demo starts over: the pause menu pops up, and the player navigates to a toggle between first- and third-person modes. The crowd “oohs” and “ahhs” – there hasn’t yet been aResigame that lets you swap between perspectives (except Village, which added that functionality as part of a paid-for update in 2021).The phrase “this is the overture to our darkest symphony yet” appears on-screen before the demo ends and we are ushered into a dark hallway to exit. “What the fuck?” someone mumbles behind me. Not every Resident Evil game has pushed the boundaries of video game horror, but this one has made an especially disturbing debut.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sign up hereAlyssa Mercante andKeza MacDonaldWed 11 Jun 2025 07.15 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 07.54 EDTShareAs protests exploded in Los Angeleslast weekend, elsewhere in the city, a coterie of games journalists and developers were gathered together to play new games at the industry’s annual summer showcase. This week’sissue is a dispatch from our correspondent Alyssa Mercante.Summer Game Fest (SGF), the annual Los Angeles-based gaming festival/marketing marathon, was set up to compete with the once-massive E3. It’s taken a few years, but now it has replaced it. 2025’s event felt like a cogent reminder that the games industry has dramatically changed since the pandemic. Whereas E3 used to commandeer the city’s convention centre smack in the middle of downtown LA, SGF is off the beaten path, nestled among the reams of fabric in the Fashion District, adjacent to Skid Row. There are fewer game companies present, it’s not open to the public and there’s no cosplay, unless it’s for marketing purposes.Its centrepiece is a live show held at the YouTube theatre near the airport, hosted by ever-present games industry hype-man Geoff Keighley and streamed to millions – and you can buy tickets for that. Some video game enthusiasts and smaller content creators told me that the in-person showcase wasn’t worth their money: just a very lengthy show that they could have watched online, culminating in a massive traffic jam to get out of Inglewood.This year’s event had some hiccups, including an attempted gatecrasher, but felt the most put-together yet. Attending SGF is a privilege, but it is also an ungodly hybrid of a marathon and a sprint: back-to-back-to-back appointments with publishers and developers with no downtime in-between, speed walking between cabanas and moving swiftly in and out of over air-conditioned rooms to ensure you don’t upset a PR person or accidentally spurn an indie developer. During brief breaks, if you even get one, you’ll shovel a canape into your gullet, wash it down with a Red Bull, have a quick bite of some (surprisingly good) PC Gamer-branded ice-cream, and attempt to get a few of your thoughts down on paper.Find your zen ... Urban Jungle.Illustration: Kylyk Games/Assemble EntertainmentI saw a lot of games this weekend, some of which I can’t talk about, but once again it was the indie games that were the most memorable. Not just because they’re unexpected or unique or silly, but because there are usually far fewer restrictions while you play, devs are more open to questions and there aren’t eight PR people standing over your shoulder to ensure you don’t open up an unfinished menu or wander some place you shouldn’t.On night one, I stuck my head in at the Media Indie Exchange (MIX) party downtown, and was immediately enraptured withUrban Jungle, a plant based game that speaks to my newfound love of horticulture. Placing plants around a cutesy little room afforded me a brief moment of zen in a crowded space full of people trying out dozens of indie games.Then there’sPetal Runner, a pixel art RPG that looks and feels like a Game Boy-era Pokémon title. Published by iam8bit and developed by two people who met in the Instagram comments under some cyberpunk artwork, it’s a beautiful, adorable, “no violence” RPG. Rather than engage in the questionable practice of capturing cute creatures and forcing them to fight each other, you simply help deliver them to their new owners and “calibrate” or calm them down through a series of old-school minigames. Then you hop on your motorcycle (Petal Runner’s programmer was inspired to get a bike after watching Tron: Legacy) to deliver another pet. After just 15 minutes, its modern chip-tune soundtrack, cool-toned palette, and cute creatures had me sold.ThickAs Thieves, meanwhile, is a multiplayer stealth game. A representative for the developer told me that the team wanted to make a multiplayer game that avoided the three “black holes”, or oversaturated genres: shooters, PvP combat, and pure action gameplay. The result is something that feels like Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood mixed with Dishonored: you’ll sneak through maps set in a dark early 1900s world cut through with slices of rich colour, while you try to pull off difficult heists to impress a thieves’ guild. But other players are trying to do the exact same thing, and guards and civilians will get in your way.View image in fullscreenSlay your dragons … Monster Hunter Now.Photograph: NianticI also got a chance to try out the new season ofMonster Hunter Nowfrom Niantic, the studio behind Pokémon Go. This augmented reality game drops you into a version of the real world filled with monsters from Capcom’s iconic action game, condensing the series’ epic fights into bite-size battles that are barely a minute long (they can be close to an hour in the mainline games). And I played the new, four-person party gameLego Partywith two other journalists, screaming as our Lego characters fell over each other during minigames or stole gold bricks in an attempt to get to first place. It was fun and freeing; people gathered around us as we yelled and guffawed and talked smack with gusto, as if we needed this game to help cleanse our tired palates.Every game I spent even a few minutes with this weekend was imbued with passion and creativity, no matter the size of the team or the scope of the project. It was a testament to the drive that fuels so many in this space, and the technological advancements that let smaller teams (sometimes just one or two people) make beautifully complex games. Seeing tons of fellow journalists and developers bright-eyed and excited, even with so many of us struggling to find work, recently laid off, or otherwise worried about the future, was a shot of adrenaline.But it was also impossible to ignore that something larger was taking place in LA, acting as a sombre backdrop to this comparatively low-stakes weekend of video games. On Saturday, protests broke out in Los Angeles, with citizens pushing back against the militant and cruel anti-immigration raids taking place across the city. The constant whir of helicopters was a bizarre soundtrack to the weekend; many people who had come from out of state or even out of the country were noticeably concerned about the escalating events. We furtively shared updates with each other at hands-on appointments, whispering about the national guard, warning each other to travel together and safely. On Sunday night, dozens of journalists and devs were told they couldn’t leave a downtown LA bar where they had gathered; the LAPD had shut down the area, determined to quell the protests.On the last day of SGF, we chatted about how weird it was to preview video games during such an acute political moment. One person told me they were playing a demo that kicked off with tanks and military men and, as he played, he heard the sounds of a helicopter circling overhead, and wondered where the game ended and the real world began.Alyssa MercanteWhat to playView image in fullscreenTense sci-fi … The Alters.Photograph: 11 Bit StudiosFrom the makers of Frostpunk and This War of Mine,The Altersis a strangesci-fi strategyexperiment that sees stranded space-worker Jan cloning himself several times over in order to assemble a team big enough to make it off an exoplanet before the sun rises and burns everything to cinders.

The US is taking another step towards authoritarianismWed 11 Jun 2025 14.09 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 21.30 EDTShareDonald Trump will celebrate his birthday with aNorth Korean-style military paradecosting tens of millions of dollars this weekend. He has gratefully accepted the early gift of the demonstrations, which have spread across the country, with more scheduled for Saturday. The president’simmigration crackdownspurredoverwhelmingly peaceful protestsin Los Angeles. Ordering in troops, over the governor’s head, then inflamed the situation and allowed the agent of chaos to portray himself as its nemesis once more.Mr Trump has diverted attention from his rift with Elon Musk, the stalling of his “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill, the court-ordered return of the wrongly deported Kilmar Ábrego García and the impending impact of tariffs. But underlying the manufactured crisis is a deeper agenda: reigniting fear of undocumented migrants, delegitimising protest, and thus expanding his power. Migrant families, and those who have taken to the streets to support them, areportrayed as “animals”and the perpetrators of “invasion and third-world lawlessness” – requiring Mr Trump to amass more might to protect America.Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, rightly described this asan assault on democracy. As he noted, “authoritarian regimes begin by targeting people who are least able to defend themselves. But they do not stop there.” Due process has been discarded. American citizens are among those being swept up in raids. Mr Trump has said that Mr Newsom himself should be arrested. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, calls the protesters “insurrectionists” – though his boss, of course,pardoned the actual insurrectionistsof the January 6 Capitol attack.Mr Trump’s tactics arefamiliarin both the broad and narrow sense. In his book On Tyranny, published in 2017, the historian Timothy Snyderurged readersto listen for “dangerous words” such as “emergency” and reminded them that “the sudden disaster” requiring the suspension of freedoms “is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book”.Mr Trump drew a bleak portrait of American carnage in his inaugural speech and described himself as“the only thing standing between the American dream and total anarchy”. Since his re-election he has declared emergencies to push through tariffs, loosen energy regulations and ramp up deportations. His methods are transparent – and sometimes blocked by courts – yet still effective. For his supporters, each rock thrown, each billow of smoke, is fresh evidence of the menacing “other” encroaching upon their home.Yet if his methods are familiar, they are also going further. He has moved fromxenophobiato echoing fascist tropes of migrants “poisoning the blood” and portrays an enemy within,suggesting that Mr Newsom and Karen Bass, the Los Angeles mayor, aretrying to aid “criminal invaders”. In his first term, Mr Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act (and, reportedly, said that troops should “just shoot” Black Lives Matter protesters). Gen Mark Milley and others are no longer present to hold him back. Alarmingly, he warns that any protests at his parade will face “very heavy force”.All those who stand against Mr Trump’s weaponised bigotry and hunger for untrammelled power must make it clear that they are defending the law and not defying it. Responsibly challenging the abuse and entrenchment of power is not only the right of citizens, but a duty.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But there is a host of valid reasons for lawful demonstrators to remain anonymousWed 11 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 10.05 EDTShareDo protesters have a right to hide their faces?Donald Trump, who likes to show and see his own face as often as possible, clearly does not think so. One demand to universities has been that they outlaw masking at demonstrations; in response toprotests in California, the US presidentdemanded on social mediathat anyone wearing a mask be arrested immediately.Never mind the apparent double standard, as Ice agents refuse to take off face coverings and hide their name tags, defying any accountability; there is a widespread sense that standing by one’s identity is a crucial part of standing up to unjust power. In fact, that intuition is at the core of civil disobedience. But it is not plausible in our present moment; what’s more, there is a long countervailing tradition of validating citizens’ right to anonymity. As recently as the mid-1990s, it was affirmed by none other than the supreme court.Lawful protest is categorically different from civil disobedience, though much current commentary conflates them. In civil disobedience, citizens openly – or even, as Martin Luther King Jr put it, “lovingly” – break the law; they make themselves identifiable to the authorities and are willing to accept punishment (but hope that they will not be treated like ordinary criminals). This strategy serves multiple purposes: it demonstrates moral seriousness, it flags “highest respect for the law” in general (MLK again) and it counts on a majority coming to see the injustice these loving lawbreakers are flagging – and then change things.Living in Los Angeles is a test of empathy | Dave SchillingRead moreTo be sure, the requirement to reveal one’s identity has not been accepted by all philosophers of civil disobedience:for some, what matters is that whistleblowers such as Chelsea Manning were doing the right thing. Their identity was not crucial for the public to comprehend scandalous facts they revealed (in the end, at great personal cost).Past lawful protests, meanwhile, occurred in a different media context. The civil rights movement assumed that its messages about injustice would reach a majority of US citizens – as well as people of good will in Washington DC. After all, activists appealed above the heads of racist governors such as Alabama’s George Wallace to the federal government. Today, such assumptions are doubtful. As everyone knows, we no longer live in an age of three large TV networks, which, despite various failings, could be expected faithfully to transmit images of civil rights protesters being brutally treated by southern police. In our deeply distorted, often outright dysfunctional, media landscape, messages are either not transmitted at all (just watch Fox at moments that could be embarrassing for Trump); or they are reframed such that the original message is turned on its head (those peacefully protesting against lawlessness become the law-breakers).Beyond these risks, there is the by now clear and present danger of the Trump administration engaging in personal retribution and making examples of individuals – think of student detentions and deportations. Under such conditions, hiding one’s identity is an understandable act of caution, and such caution should not be criminalized. While democracies such asCanadaalso have anti-masking laws, these aim at rioters and those assembled unlawfully, not people exercising their right to free expression. We are clearly at a moment where protest is beginning to take courage – a point driven home to me when I politely asked some older women holding up posters outside the main gate at Princeton University whether I could take their picture. Several said that I should not show their faces.As in debates about privacy, someone sooner or later will say that anyone who has nothing to hide should not hide their face. But in an age of ubiquitous surveillance, now supplemented with rapidly advancing facial recognition technology, you do not know what will be done with evidence of your presence at a protest. We have asecretballot because we do not want people to be intimidated, but also because we don’t want powerful people – not necessarily always the state; it could be the boss who does not like your vote for democratic socialism – to know about our stances.We are witnessing the first stages of a Trump police state | Robert ReichRead moreThe supreme court saw this logic three decades ago. Itdefended the rightto stay anonymous of an elderly lady handing out leaflets opposing a school tax levy in Ohio. The court reminded Americans that the authors of the Federalist papers had used pseudonyms; the justices declared anonymity a means “to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation”, going so far as to ennoble it as a “shield from the tyranny of the majority” (of course, today’s protesters are not standing against a real majority – what Trump and Miller are doing is precisely not popular).To be sure, when protest is meant directly to engage others, there is something not right about an asymmetry of the masked speaking to the unmasked: freedom of assembly, among other things, ensures that we can getinto each other’s faces. Already in the 19th century, revolutionaries hoped that those manning barricades and soldiers would end up talking and fraternizing. Teargas –first used against barricades, even before deployment in war – renders that vision impossible. Today, what risks they take, and, specifically, how much they want to reveal to authorities and fellow citizens, should be up to individuals engaged in lawful protest.Jan-Werner Müller is a Guardian US columnist and a professor of politics at Princeton UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionProtestTrump administrationActivismLos Angeles Ice protestsLos AngelesCaliforniacommentShareReuse this content"

Now we are in a second phaseWed 11 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 12.13 EDTShareOn Monday, the Pentagon sent700 active-duty marines to Los Angelesand doubled the number of national guard troops deployed there to 4,000, to quell protests Donald Trump said on Sunday were already “under control”, “still simmering ... but not very much”.The same day, the US president used the word “insurrectionists” to describe demonstrators against the unprecedentedly large and fierce immigration deportation raids by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) that started on Friday in that city. The remark echoedhis long-held desireto invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act, which would authorize him to send the military anywhere in the country to put down dissent.California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, sued the Trump administration, arguing that it isunconstitutionalto use the armed forces inside the US, except in the most extreme situations.Put another way, the government is not allowed to wage war against its own citizens. But this is what it is doing.Living in Los Angeles is a test of empathy | Dave SchillingRead moreIn its first months in office, the Trump administration enacted what could be called soft authoritarianism: rhetorical glorification of white masculinity and derision of frailty and difference; intimidation of liberal democratic institutions – universities, law firms, the press, and the arts; weaponization of the judicial system against Trump’s perceived foes.Laced through this non-violent aggression are real violence and reward for violence toward selective populations: the denial of life-saving medical care for transgender people and pregnant women in distress, in deference to the “personhood” of their fetuses; the pardon of the insurrectionists who attacked the Capitol and killed officers on 6 January 2021. And most prominent, the kidnap, deportation without due process, and rendition of immigrants to foreign gulags.But in the last week or so, a second phase has begun unfolding: the literal weaponization of the government to contain dissent. It is no hyperbole to call this, and the less visible mechanisms that reinforce it, fascism.This weekend in Los Angeles, protests broke out over Ice raids across the city, especially at workplaces including a clothing warehouse and Home Depot, where migrants muster for day labor. The raids were aimed at meeting an unattainable quota of 3,000 arrests a day. In this diverse city, which immigrants are rebuilding after the devastating fires, the outrage Ice provokedwas inevitable.Some of the resistance was not peaceful – objects were thrown at cars, for instance – but the LA police got matters in hand. Still, over the objections of Newsom and LA’s mayor, Karen Bass, Trump deployed 300 national guard troops to the scene. They carried long guns and shields and fired “less-lethal munitions”, including flash-bangs, teargas and rubber bullets into the crowds; they also wielded their batons.At the same time as repressing citizens’ free speech, Ice ispreventing elected officialsfrom fulfilling their responsibility to oversee federal detention facilities in their jurisdictions. On Sunday, two US representatives from New York were denied entry to the federal building in downtown Manhattan where about 100 immigrants had been kept for days in small, short-term holding cells, some sleeping on bathroom floors. A month earlier, themayor of Newark, New Jersey, was arrested outside a federal detention center for attempting to do the same thing.Speaking on Friday with NBC News, Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, would not rule out arresting Newsom or Bass if they interfered with the deportation raids. “I’ll say it about anybody,” he proclaimed. “You cross that line, it’s a felony to knowingly harbor and conceal an illegal alien. It is a felony to impede law enforcement doing their job.”Homan later walked back his threat to arrest Newsom, who had dared him to do so.Trump expressedno reservations. “I think it’s great,” he told the press.Trump has unleashed something terrifying in the US – that even he may be powerless to control | Gaby HinsliffRead moreLike every authoritarian regime, this one justifies doing its “job” as a defense of public safety necessitated by lawlessness. “Despite what you may be hearing, the record checks show that we arrested illegal aliens with criminal histories including CHILD CRUELTY, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, DRUG TRAFFICKING, ASSAULT, ROBBERY, HUMAN SMUGGLING,” Homan postedon X.Did they? Ice always says it is arresting only criminals, but it conflates undocumented status with criminality. Yes, it is afelonyto conceal or harbor an “alien” – but giving sanctuary, as churches have long done, was rarely penalized until now. Being in the US without documentation, meanwhile, is not a crime. It is a civil, administrative offence.Nor is it a crime to peacefully resist the government’s torment of one’s family and neighbors. “Our officers and agents continued to enforce immigration law in LA, despite the violent protesters,” Homan continued. Somenews outletshave called the protests “riots”, a characterization that local observers, including the governor, the mayor and radio hostCharlamagne the God, reject. They counter that the demonstrations were loud, angry and almost entirely nonviolent before the national guard arrived to escalate the tension.This sequence of events is not accidental.On Facebook, Katherine Franke, a tenured Columbia law school professor who was forced to resign after defending student protesters against the war on Gaza, recounted a recent conversation with “a prominent Democratic attorney general”. Asked where things were going, he predicted, on “good information”, Franke paraphrased, that in May or June the federal government would intensify the crackdowns to provoke resistance, “then use that provocation as a justification for declaring martial law”. The declaration, she continued, could free the administration not just to deploy troops but also to suspend elections or the writ of habeas corpus.Trump seems to be affirming these predictions. “We’re gonna have troops everywhere,” hetold reporters. “If we see danger to our country and to our citizens [the response] will be very, very strong.” He nattered on about protesters spitting on police. “They spit, we hit,” said the poet-president, looking pleased with himself.While manufacturing peril, authoritarian regimes seek to manufacture consent, as Noam Chomsky put it – or, better, enthusiasm – for the exercise of their power. To do so, they stage mass rituals of adulation andspectacular displays of the military might at the beloved leader’s command. On the US army’s officialFacebookpage, the ad campaign for the 14 June military parade celebrating the army’s and Trump’s simultaneous birthdays is unceasing. Repeatedly refreshed is avideoof him at his desk. “I am thrilled to invite everyone to an unforgettable celebration, one like you’ve never seen before,” he reads woodenly. “This is your army. This is your country. This is America250,” says the quietly awed narrator of anothervideo. The first eight seconds of the one-minute spot feature Trump.We are witnessing the first stages of a Trump police state | Robert ReichRead moreBut enthusiasm is not easily won, and trying to compel obedience through force creates backlash. Better to attain anticipatory consent through fear. This is where surveillance comes in. To complement the FBI, the National Security Agency and myriad state-level snitching mechanisms for everything from abortion to teaching Black history, the administration has, perhaps unintentionally, created a sophisticated spying apparatus at the so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge.The Heritage Foundation wrote the plan to reduce the administrative state to the size of a supply closet; thus, Doge was born. But Trump never cared about waste, fraud and abuse (he believes in them all). For him, the aim was to build a force of unswervingly loyal apparatchiks. In fact, as theWashington Postreports, the department is now scrambling to rehire federal employees. It turns out that things the government does, such as process tax filings and fly weather balloons, need people who know how to do them.But Doge is not obsolete. Now that the supreme court has turned over the nation’s personal data to Big Balls and the boys, and AI is connecting every dataset with every other dataset, it may have a more useful function: coordinating the surveillance state. Homeland security is alreadyspidering through IRS datato locate undocumented immigrants through their tax filings ($96.7bnin federal, state and local taxes in 2024).While the shock troops do the dirty work and the marching bands inspire the masses, Doge may expand from enforcing fealty in the federal workforce to exacting it from everyone.

This letter proves itBernard E HarcourtA message tucked into an old book serves as a reminder that the assault on the institution is part of a long-planned effortWed 11 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 12.20 EDTShareOn the shelf in my library, I have an autographed copy of a book written by a former Republican congressman from New York, John LeBoutillier, titled Harvard Hates America: The Odyssey of a Born-Again American. It was published in 1978, two years before LeBoutillier was elected to Congress – and decades before the Trump administration’s assault on the institution. But its message is familiar in 2025.The book is a scathing criticism ofHarvard University, in large part over its supposed left-leaning professors who allegedly indoctrinate their undergraduates. Its thrust is straightforward: Harvard is America’s problem.Today, the blueprint for Donald Trump’s attack on Harvard, Columbia and other liberal arts colleges and universities can be found in another text: Project 2025’s Mandate for Leadership, a guide to rightwing government reform published in April 2023 by the Heritage Foundation – over a year before any encampments went up on Columbia’s campus. But the Republican ambition to subjugate Harvard and Columbia traces further back, at least to the 1970s, when it became apparent that college-educated voters favored the Democratic party.My copy of Harvard Hates America is autographed and dedicated to two constituents. And I recently stumbled on something tucked into the fold: a letter that LeBoutillier enclosed to the recipients of his gift. On House of Representatives stationery, LeBoutillier wrote:Long after I had graduated from Harvard and was a freshman member of Congress, I realized just how terrible some of the people educating our young are; they are not only liberals, but they use their “power” over their students to preach an anti-American leftist point of view. And this is not confined to Harvard. Indeed, this is a disease spreading throughout the academic world.I believe that this politicalization of education threatens this country. And, coupled with a bias so obviously evident in the media, makes it difficult for we conservatives to get our message across.Well, I’m going to continue to fight for our point of view and our principles.Enjoy the book.LeBoutillier was not alone in these sentiments. In a taped conversation with Henry Kissinger and Alexander Haig Jr in the Oval Office on 14 December 1972, President Richard Nixon attacked university professors, claiming they were the enemy. His rhetoric was characteristically colorful: “The professors are the enemy. Professors are the enemy. Write that on the blackboard 100 times and never forget it.”Conservatives like the journalist Irving Kristol, the philosopher Allan Bloom, and Ronald Reagan’s education secretary, William Bennett, wouldperpetuate the criticismsof supposedly left-leaning universities in the 1980s. And there is a straight line from those attacks in the 1970s and 80s to the Trump administration.View image in fullscreenThe LeBoutillier letter.In a speech titled “The universities are the enemy” and delivered at the National Conservatism Conference in Orlando, Florida, on 2 November 2021, JD Vance declared: “I think if any of us want to do the things that we want to do for our country and for the people who live in it, we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country.” Vance would then add, quoting Nixon: “There is a wisdom in what Richard Nixon said approximately 40 to 50 years ago. He said, and I quote, ‘The professors are the enemy.’”The Heritage Foundation picked up the baton in a 43-page chapter on education in the Project 2025 text. Remarkably, the Trump administration’s continuing assault on Harvard, Columbia and other universities is unfolding line-by-line, chapter and verse, from that script.So, right after a federal judge in Boston blocked the Department of Homeland Security from revoking Harvard University’s ability to enroll foreign students, Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, announced that the administration intended to revoke the visas of Chinese students, especially those with ties to the Chinese Communist party. On page 355 of its Mandate for Leadership, Project 2025 calls for “Confronting the Chinese Communist Party’s Influence on Higher Education”.At a press conference in the Oval Office on 30 May 2025, Trump attacked Harvard and said he would redirect the school’s grants to vocational education. “I’d like to see the money go to trade schools,” Trump said. The remark, again, came straight out of the Project 2025 playbook, which states on pages 15-16 and 319 that the federal government should prioritize “trade schools” and “career schools” over the “woke-dominated system” of universities.The Trump administration demanded that Columbia’s Middle Eastern, South Asian and African studies program be placed “under academic receivership”. Again, straight out of the playbook. Project 2025 calls on page 356 for “wind[ing] down so-called ‘area studies’ programs at universities”.Trump signed executive orders on inauguration day banning diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and “gender ideology” at institutions such as universities that receive federal funding. Again, textbook material. Project 2025 argued on page 322, regarding educational institutions, that “enforcement of civil rights should be based on a proper understanding of those laws, rejecting gender ideology and critical race theory”.In fact, the first line of the chapter on education in Project 2025 says it all: “The federal Department of Education should be eliminated.”Christopher Rufo, the conservative activist behind the attack on critical race theory and gender studies, has openly described the Republican attack on universities as a “counter-revolution” planned well before the campus protests. The Republican offensive traces back at least to the rise of the Black Lives Matter and abolition movements in the wake of the police killings of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, George Floyd and others. “It’s a revolution against revolution,”Rufo admitted, adding: “I think that actually we are a counter-radical force in American life that, paradoxically, has to use what many see as radical techniques.”And what the Trump administration has accomplished with its ongoing assault on Harvard and Columbia is the “prototype” of that wider counterrevolution. Rufois explicitabout this. “If you take Columbia University as really the first trial of this strategy, we’ve seen an enormous payoff,” he said. “I’d like to see that prototype industrialized and applied to all of the universities as a sector.”Given this history tracing back to the 1970s, it is puzzling why people continue to believe that theRepublicansare trying to reform the universities to address antisemitism. It should be clear that their actions are instead part of a decades-long effort to humble universities for political reasons, namely to counter the trend that college-educated people tend to vote Democratic. Nixon was frank about this. That’s what made professors the enemy.On top of that, of course, there is profit and political economy. At the press conference last week, Trump admitted why he wants to shift education funding to trade schools.Encouraged by billionaire Elon Musk at his side,Trump said: “I’d like to see trade schools set up, because you could take $5bn plus hundreds of billions more, which is what is spent [on research universities], and you could have the greatest trade school system anywhere in the world. And that’s what we need to buildhisrockets and robots and things thathe’s doing” – pointing to Musk.Trump could not have been more explicit. “We probably found our pot of gold,” Trump adds, “and that is what has been wasted at places like Harvard.”The Trump administration has seen some successes in its counterrevolution against higher education. So far, the lower federal courts have run interference. But there have been major casualties already, especially in the funding of sciences and medical research, academic integrity and autonomy, and area studies. Faculty governance at some universities has also been diminished, at some universities decimated.Anyone who is genuinely interested in understanding what the Trump administration is up to and to anticipate its next moves should return to books like Harvard Hates Americaand then read Project 2025’s chapter on education. It clearly explains the past four months and predicts the future – one in which the federal government will sacrifice liberal arts colleges and universities to the benefit of trade schools, faith-based institutions and military academies.The path ahead also includes, in all likelihood, eliminating the American Bar Association as an accrediting system (page 359), as well as the other actors in the “federal accreditation cartel” (pages 320 and 355); terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (page 354), phasing out income-driven repayment plans (page 337), and privatizing student loans (page 340); allocating at least 40% of federal funding of education “to international business programs that teach about free markets and economics” (page 356); and a host of other radical proposals.It is time now to be honest about the decades-long history of the Republican assault on higher education. Too many of the university leaders who are negotiating with the Trump administration about campus protest are naive at best and fail to grasp the stakes of theongoing counterrevolution– or complicit at worst. In the process, they are undermining their universities and violating their fiduciary duties to their constituents – students, alumni, faculty and staff. By capitulating based on a pretext, a feint in military terms, those leaders have sacrificed the integrity of the research enterprise and the autonomy of the academy.Liberal arts colleges and universities are a gem in the US, envied by people around the world. Their strength lies in fostering critical thought, creativity and inventiveness throughout the humanities, social sciences, and natural and applied sciences. A liberal arts education, at its best, cultivates critical thinking that challenges society’s strengths and weaknesses, and asks how to make the world more just with more freedom for everyone. Those are the true aims of higher education.Bernard E Harcourtis a professor of law and political science at Columbia University in New York City and a directeur d’études at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris.

First, we had to stop the chaos and return Britain to economic stability. Second, we had to turn the page on Tory decline with clearLabourchoices. Third, we were instructed to rebuild our country.Wednesday’s spending review turbocharged that rebuilding. It is an investment in Britain’s renewal, so working people have more money in their pocket, more pride in their community and more hope for their children’s future. It’s what people voted for. An NHS cutting waiting lists, with care closer to the community. Wealth and opportunity no longer hoarded by only a few towns and cities.That means carbon capture projects in Merseyside, Scotland and along the east coast. It means nuclear fusion in Nottinghamshire. Rail investment in Wales. New metro schemes, everywhere from the north-east to the West Midlands, Manchester, South and West Yorkshire. Labour’s message is clear. Every community is now viewed as a source of dynamism and growth. National renewal is for everyone.Don’t mistake us – it must still be built on firm foundations. The first job of this government was to stabilise the British economy. We did need to stop the chaos. We did need to repair our public finances. And we did need to turn the page with a budget of tough but fair Labour choices. Nobody wants taxes to go up. But politics is about choices. So when we asked private schools, second homeowners and non-doms to contribute more, we chose a fairer way.Take our announcement last week to extend free school meals to every child on universal credit. One hundred thousand children will be lifted out of poverty as a result – £500 back in the pockets of hard-pressed parents. And more than that, the time. The comfort that knowing the only hunger your kid will experience that day is the hunger for learning. That is the difference we were elected to make. But it’s only possible because we took tough decisions nine months ago.It’s the same for every success in my Plan for Change so far. Every breakfast club opened, every pothole filled, every extra hospital appointment, rests on those foundations. Change and stability are not in tension. They must advance together.1:56From defence to social housing: Rachel Reeves's spending review in two minutes – videoLook at our opponents. Once again, they believe in the alchemy that says taxes can come down and spending can go up. It’s fool’s gold – precisely the sort of fiscal fantasy that dragged Britain into the mire of decline in the first place. We were crystal clear at the election – we would never put working people through that again. And we would never recklessly forfeit the opportunity to renew their communities with investment.The spending review shows why, and it starts with security. Security in your family finances, security at work, security at our borders and the defence of our country – this government is investing to keep you safe. We are protecting jobs when they are on the line, as we did with British Steel. We are creating new opportunities by investing in homegrown clean energy and life sciences where Britain has a competitive edge. We are pushing forward with the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the cold war, unleashing a “defence dividend” that will fire up our industrial communities. The NHS, too, will receive record levels of investment. The best scanners, equipment and technology will be placed in the hands of our brilliant NHS staff. And we will step up to tackle the great social justice cause of our time, with a £39bn investment in affordable housing.This last one is deeply personal for me. Shamefully, after years of Tory failure to build, more than 80% of Britons now believe owning your own home is “unaffordable for most people”. This is a national emergency – home ownership should not be a distant dream. If we don’t build more homes, homelessness rises, more children are forced to grow up in temporary accommodation, and millions of ordinary families are denied the security they deserve. It would be a disaster for working-class aspiration and I am determined to change it.I know what it’s like to struggle to make ends meet. Growing up, my family’s phone was regularly cut off, because that was the easiest bill to skip when money ran out. But because we owned our house, we always had that bedrock of security we could build a future around. A base camp for aspiration.Has Rachel Reeves made the right choices? Our panel responds to the spending reviewRead moreYoung working-class people today deserve that same opportunity. It’s basic Labour fairness. Whether you are a young family trying to buy your first home, an apprentice looking for construction jobs in your community, or a nurse working harder and harder with outdated technology at your hospital, Britain should give you a fair crack of the whip.That’s what this spending review delivers. It spreads opportunity more fairly across the country. It backs the potential of working people in every community. And with wages rising strongly, it gives a further boost to an economy that is beginning to turn a corner. A nation returned to growth, defiantly open for business, determined to deliver security and renewal for its people.I know there is so much more to do. But this week we entered a new stage in the mission of national renewal. Last autumn, we fixed the foundations. Today, we showed Britain we will rebuild.Keir Starmer is the prime minister of the United KingdomDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Give me a perimenopausal Norwegian woman any dayWed 11 Jun 2025 12.39 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 13.31 EDTShareThe current TV landscape leans heavily towards shows that skewer the rich from the point of view of writers who wildly, if sneakily, admire them. To be less polite: if shows such as the most recent White Lotus, the Apple TV+ show Your Friends & Neighbours and moviessuch as Mountainheadare all enraptured with themselves and the people they dramatise – targets who havebeen known to becomethe shows’ biggest fans – then for those viewers who have had enough, there is an alternative. It’s in Norwegian, and while watching it will force you uncomfortably close to using the phrase “hymn to middle age”, it does at least avoid the 360 degrees of glorified douchebags presently dominating TV.The Norwegian dramedyPernilleunfolds over five seasons, recently made available on Netflix, and is part of a small but marked trend around women in middle age that offers a buffer against universal bro culture. In my experience, people don’t generally like to be told they are having a moment, since it draws attention to the fact that they weren’t previously having a moment and likely won’t get another moment any time soon – but the fact remains that middle-aged women are having a moment.Mostly this takes the form of endless books and podcasts about menopause, a heartening suspension of an age-old taboo, even if it does occasionally involve a female content creator inviting us to accompany her on her “menopause journey” (no thank you!) or forcing us topay attentionto Drew Barrymore. In the case of Pernille – written by and starring the 50-year-old Norwegian actor Henriette Steenstrup – it involves a storyline built around a single mother and child protection officer in Oslo managing her two stroppy teenage daughters, her dad who is 75 and who has just came out as gay, and her affair with her colleague, a lovely county lawyer called Bjørnar. In outline, it sounds wholesome and conventional, but the writing is acute and, for my money, Pernille has more interesting things to say about sexuality than, for example,Miranda Julyand all her feverish strivings towards the avant garde.And, of course, it has a lot more to say about the experience of being alive than a bunch of fictional billionaires exchanging bons mots. The takeaway from Pernille is that there is nothing more fraught and complicated than regular life, and nothing structurally more sound – or better engineered for load bearing – than the middle-aged woman holding it together.In the show, Pernille’s ex-husband is a preoccupied novelist whose career always comes first, and when we meet her in the pilot she is mourning the death of her sister while trying to provide for her family and the abused children of greater Oslo. It feels rude but necessary to point this out: Steenstrup is a telegenic but regular-sized woman who probably wouldn’t have been cast as the lead in a US show. When her kids tell her to fuck off, or her ex-husband writes a book romanticising the affair he had when she was pregnant, the verisimilitude makes the drama intensely believable.I’m a woman of 48 – and as replaceable in the office as the swivel chair at my desk | Nilanjana BhowmickRead moreBut the show is also funny and lightly delivered, avoiding the trap of a lot of content about middle-aged women, which is the suggestion that perimenopause is just one long, terrible nightmare. I refer you to the actor Naomi Watts, whose book,Dare I Say It: Everything I Wish I’d Known About Menopause, is a helpful resource but also, possibly because publishing contracts come with big word counts, teases out every last drama of being a middle-aged woman as though it is a tour of duty in Afghanistan. (Watts has released a line of wellness products aimed at alleviating the worst menopausal symptoms and, of course, good luck to her.)These descriptions are a useful corrective to silence, but they tend to overlook the flipside of all the discomfort and change, which is the tremendous release of energy experienced by many middle-aged women, some of it angry, much of it related to the dawning realisation that in any given environment they are the most competent people in the room. Last year, I attended the fifth grade graduation ceremony of my children’s elementary school and came away, after hours of chair stacking and table folding, reminded of the fact that a good chunk of the US public school system runs on the volunteer labour of middle-aged women, most of whom also have jobs.The figure of Pernille, meanwhile, without being weird about it, properly represents and celebrates this fact: a fortysomething Norwegian woman sitting in her car in her garage to hide from her children, counselling her dad through the ridiculous rollercoaster of his late coming-out, managing her serious job and making poor decisions around her own dating life is inspiring and touching – and exactly the hero we need.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The latestdwelling price figuresreveal that for the first time the average home price across the nation is above $1m. While that will quite rightly have people concerned about affordability, we need to also think about what this means for wealth and just how unequal our society has become.A couple of weeks ago the Australian Financial Review released its latest200 richest list. It was a list of wealth, not income. Income is how much you earn over a set time – usually a year – whereas wealth is the value of everything you own right now.And my goodness, the wealth of the richest 200 has grown.Worried about the tax on $3m plus super balances? Here’s how you’ll surviveRead moreMy colleague at the Australia Institute, David Richardson, calculated that in 2004 the combined wealth of the AFR richest 200 was equivalent to 8% of Australia’s annual GDP. Now they are worth 24.5% of our annual GDP.Over the past year the wealth of the richest 200 has increased 6.9% to $667.8bn – well ahead of the3.4% increase in wages.But that should not be a surprise because wealth generally grows faster than income, and very much so over the past 25 years:If the graph does not display click hereAnd if you think that graph looks familiar, it might be becauseyou have previously seen my graphof property prices and household disposable income per capita:If the graph does not display click hereThe link between property values and wealth is rather crucial in Australia because land and the value of dwellings makes up about 55% of the total of Australian household assets (most of the rest are deposits, shares and, importantly, superannuation).And the value of dwelling and land has grown much faster than income over the past decade:If the graph does not display click hereWe can look at the house prices and see that in Sydney the median established house is now $1.395m, or that in Adelaide it has risen in the past year from $769,000 to $842,500 (a 9.6% increase), and bemoan the further falls in housing affordability. But we also need to think about what these rises in values means for those who hold them – and the ones who don’t.If the graph does not display click hereThe housing figures we cite each quarter for house prices are actually titled Total Value of Dwellings. The Bureau of Statistics estimated the total value of Australia’s dwellings in the March quarter this year at $10.9tn. Yes, trillion.That was a $125.3bn increase from the December quarter last year.By contrast, in the first three months of this year, Australians were paid $300.2bn in wages and salaries, up $4.35bn from the 2024 December quarter.That means in one-quarter the value of housing stock owned by households (ie not including property owned by governments or businesses) went up $125.3bn while the value of wages paid went up just $4.35bn.Bad news! The communist Albanese government is introducing a new superannuation tax on the rich! | First Dog on the MoonRead moreIf you are starting to think owning property might be a good way to get some wealth and worsening housing affordability means fewer people are able to accumulate wealth, then you are right.The total $10.9tn is now four times the value of Australia’s annual GDP. As economistAlex Joiner noted, that is well above the value of US housing stock and it’s a major drag on our productivity, because land, to be honest, doesn’t do anything except generate wealth.And wealth is very much more concentrated at the top than is income.Thesurvey on income and wealthfrom the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2019-20 revealed that the richest 20% held 48% of total household income. That might seem bad enough, but in the same year the top 20% held 62% of all wealth:If the graph does not display click hereWealth also grows faster at the top.Income inequality in the decade from 2009-10 was relatively stable. But the wealth of those in the 90th percentile (ie wealthier than 89% of Australians) grew by 39% compared with just 24% for those in the 40th percentile:If the graph does not display click hereAnd here’s the kicker: we tax income quite well; we barely tax wealth at all.Remember that $4.35bn increase in wages and salaries? Most of that would be captured by income tax.What about that $123.5bn increase in dwelling value? Barely any of it is taxed at all. A very small part of it will get captured by increased council rates or land tax, but for the most part, as with all forms of increased wealth, it is barely touched by the tax office.And this is the point behind those fighting against the absurdly small changes to tax on superannuation. Barely anyone will get hit by it – maybe 0.5% of us. And even if for some weird reason we would go 30 years and 10 federal elections without the $3m threshold being changed, you would need to squint and shuffle some numbers around to have maybe 10% affected.The current median superannuation balance for men in their early 50s is about $162,000; for women it is $111,000. You really think $3m is anything even remotely possible for most people?If the graph does not display click hereSo why the ruckus? The same reason there is massive noise about any changes to the capital gains tax discount: wealth.Those with wealth like property prices rising because that increases their wealth, and they love that the capital gains tax discount gives them a 50% tax break when they generate even more wealth.The attempts to change superannuation tax concessions has worried the extremely wealthy that people will realise just how rigged the system is in their favour. And they worry it might finally be the start of attempts to address the growing wealth inequality in this country. It should be.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsHousingSuperannuationTaxInequalitycommentShareReuse this content"

Get those diggers digging forsocial purposeand growth, with rail, trams, insulated homes and much more. That £39bn for social housing stretches for a 300,000 new homes per year target, not reached for half a century.Meanwhile, it’s a win-win for net zero, with billions for macho nuclear plants trouncing anti-net zero, climate-denying Tories and Reform, who think windmills are for wimps.This£113bn capital spendingstory at last sounds solidly Labour. The facts on the ground are good, but a richer narrative of social justice is still missing. Borrowing rules are changing to permit capital spending, but why not invest in human capital, when nothing can be built without human skills?The chancellor’s shower of gold needs a sprinkle of political fairy dust: “renewal” sounds like repairs, but Labour’s messaging needs to lift hearts and hopes. Those spades need to be in the ground fast to kickstart growth, to ensure people give Labour the credit it deserves for ending austerity.Defence gets its necessary catapult, protecting us and undersea cables, but its vital purpose is to bind us back politically into the lost Europe we rashly departed. Health gets an unexpectedly bigger fillip, but at 40%, let that be the maximum proportion of GDP. No more growth in spending on the old, while schools get very little. Long-term thinking needs to reverse those priorities, tilting the balance towards the young and the future. Let the autumn’schild poverty taskforcedo that, with a strong social democratic message to sharpen Labour’s legend.A housing crisis ‘solution’ based on a fallacyKirsty MajorDeputy Opinion editor for the GuardianRachel Reeves’s headline-grabbing pledge of £39bn for affordable and social housing is based on one big assumption: that the housing crisis is caused by a lack of supply.By increasing the number of homes, the logic goes, prices will be pushed down, and the crisis of affordability will be solved. The funding comes in addition to changes toplanning regulationsaimed at boosting housebuilding across the country. By putting shovels in the ground, the chancellor hopes to solve two problems at once – putting keys in hands and boosting economic growth. A neat solution, right?Well, it would be if Britain’s housing crisis was a supply-side problem. But it is not. If you don’t believe me, just ask the OBR. This spring the body predicted that these changes to planning policy could bring house prices down by only0.8%by 2029. The average UK house price is£271,415– this means it would drop to £269,243. It’s not nothing, but it’s far from something.Demand in the UK has been artificially inflated since the 1980s by a mix of lending rules relaxation and pressure from buy-to-let landlords and foreign investors. There is no point in affordable housing – housing sold at a percentage of the market rate – if the market rate goes up. Yes, families will be able to leave emergency accommodation and have roofs over their heads, and some private renters might be able move into housing association accommodation. This is to be celebrated in the short term. But there is no point in more council housing if waiting lists keep going up because rents in the private sector continue to rise. There is no point in more houses if people can’t afford to buy them.Labour’srenters’ rights billmay go some way to easing some of this demand. Proposals beingfloatedto loosen mortgage lending will not. We will have to wait and see how these policies play out in the housing market. As things stand, the new funding is a step in the right direction, but by no means the solution.Substantial spending – but not for the manySahil DuttaLecturer in political economyBy the raw numbers alone, Labour can saythisis no return to austerity. The government, after all, will dole out billions for capital projects, and day-to-day NHS spending will rise. But for many, it won’t feel that way.Because the lived reality of austerity was never just about spending in the aggregate. It was about who and what we prioritised as a society. Money was stripped from the young, the sick, the poor, the arts, education and local government. Workers and regions of “low productivity” sectors decayed, while riches were showered on the already wealthy.In its fixation on the fantasy of high economic growth, Labour is unable to fully break from that. Instead, it has concentrated fiscal largesse on high-productivity sectors in the hope that this amounts to an industrial strategy. Investing in tech, R&D and AI will always sound impressive. But the sector is awash with cash already – what it lacks is a useful purpose and proper regulation. Likewise, whatever the geopolitical context, there is little evidence that military-industrial spending is an efficient way to boost employment and growth, or improve people’s lives. More promising is the extra funding for affordable housing. Yet under-resourced councils could struggle to contain the predatory costs of private building contractors.There was once a time when Rachel Reeves spoke about the importance of the everyday economy, but from the military to tech to construction companies, it is the commanding heights of the private sector who should be happiest today.‘Treasury brain’ still reignsDhananjayan SriskandarajahChief executive of the New Economics FoundationCapital spending alone won’t improve people’s living standards. The extra investment may mean we can build more homes, renewable energy, public transport and other vital infrastructure. Despite her hopes that this will rejuvenate our economy in the years to come, we also need urgent action to improve people’s lives today.There was lots of talk of security – 17 mentions in the speech, no less – but I fear with the diversion of funds to defence spending, the chancellor is overlooking household economic security as a lever for growth. Unless we also boost day-to-day spending in key departments, living standards will continue to decline. Indeed, keeping the two-child benefit cap and slashing support for disabled people is making millions of people feel less secure. Investing in social infrastructure will improve lives almost immediately and have just as great long-term effects.On days like this, it is clear that the government has fallen victim to “Treasury brain”, clouded by outdated and arbitrary fiscal rules that it has set itself. Instead it should find better ways to assess safe borrowing levels, and tax wealth in line with other forms of income so we can tackle poverty, reduce inequality and protect our planet.Families like mine have been left with more questions than answersJonny RobertsSingle parent, working part-time, who takes part inChanging Realities,a collaboration of almost 200 parents on a low income working with researchers at the University of YorkThe chancellor’s speech today marked a welcome change in tone about the future – less focus on economic misery, heavier on hope and investment. But what I and the millions of parents like me, struggling with costs, needed to hear more about is how Reeves’s vision actually converts into reality.How will the promise to make sure “every child has the chance to thrive” be realised? Especially when there was nothing in this spending review on ending the two-child benefit limit or providing support for families in poverty through investing in social security, all the more ominous when Department for Work and Pensions spending is scheduled to contract by 0.2%.What will the (excellent) expansion of free school meals to all universal credit claimants mean for extended support in-school via the pupil premium? And when will the free breakfast clubs, which have started in 750 schools, be rolled out everywhere?The chancellor opened by noting that people want to feel change in their communities. Last week,Changing Realities and PPRset out a series of measures that would make real inroads into tackling the economic hardship faced by families like mine. Today we are still left waiting in anxious anticipation of the budget and child poverty strategy this autumn, and in the hope of real change, which simply must come.‘Mission-driven’ government was left behind in this spending reviewHannah WhiteDirector and chief executive of the Institute for GovernmentLabour’s manifesto, which won the party the election, was built on the concept of “mission-driven” government. This included five long-term, cross-cutting objectives – the NHS, safer streets, net zero, opportunity for all and economic growth.In today’s spending review, the headline strategy is different,with the chancellor instead focusing on three priorities – health, economy and security. This means the mission-leading health and net zero departments get some of the most generous settlements, and economic infrastructure and housebuilding are prioritised. But the two remaining missions, safer streets and opportunity for all, have done less well for now.The spending review falls short of using missions as “a new way of doing government” by making spending decisions focused on outcomes – as the manifesto promised.The idea was that having objectives that cut across the silos of government departments would drive greater collaboration and better value for money. Groups of ministers for each mission did work together on spending plans, but this has not translated into shared budgets, outcomes or efficiency targets that they will be jointly responsible for delivering.The spending review has been the first serious test of Labour’s approach to organising government, but so far this seems to be more about allocating budgets than anything more innovative.Explore more on these topicsSpending review 2025The panelEconomic policyRachel ReevesEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Even so, the ABChas quotedthe Colac-based Dairy Farmers Victoria president, Mark Billing, explaining: “This is not a normal year.” He’s right: in parts of southern Australia, rainfall data’s shown totals at near-lowest or lowest levels since record-keeping began.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterAustralian farmers have adapted their agricultural methods and listened to science to prepare for unpredictable conditions, but no one was prepared for this. Now, 18 months after farmers began trucking water and hand-feeding their animals, stockpiled feed is running out. Shipping in more pressures the farmer to front the capital for its purchase – a burden that’s pushed many tosell off animalsand sell off land. The bush telegraph in rural communities like mine has been relaying stories of abattoirs so full with the unsustainable stock that some farmers are left with animals that will simply – pointlessly – have to die.No one needs me to tell them climate change is making droughts worse. But as a nation dependent on local agriculture to feed itself, what we need to work out is how a crisis with such dire implications is barely on the mental register of a city like Melbourne – with 5 million inhabitants and a mere two hours’ drive from Colac – because despite the severity, despitestate government emergency measures– it just isn’t.Depending on which corners of the internet you hang out in, the drought gets scant mention even in the outrage towards federal environment minister Murray Watt’s provisional approval of a 45-year life extension for Woodside’s North West Shelf gas mega-project in Western Australia. My colleague Adam Morton and some others have madethe obvious connection, and excoriated a project the Australia Institute calculates will generate4.3bn tonnes of emissions“with no proposal for abatement at all”.But others did not. Which provokes an equal and opposite question: why aren’t climate-hit farmers bullrushing Watt’s office themselves?A recentPeter Lewis piece remindshow recent rollouts of renewable energy “ran the real risk of being sidelined bya lack of community social licence”. I can vouch “Stop AusNet’s towers” corflutes still hang in our town.As we try to get our heads around the reality of climate change, the largest obstacle to meaningful action appears to be the siloing of stakeholder communities. If droughts are invisible to city slickers, why should any farming community believe transmission lines are anything but an eyesore?When it comes to environmental policy, gaining “social licence” is an omnidirectional struggle – not because rural communities are climate deniers or that climate activists are self-appointed moralisers or even that governments steamroll communities into policy decisions. An overwhelming majority of Australiansbelieve in climate change, but evidence suggests communities are no longer holding different opinions so much as they are holding completely different conversations, and I suspect the pick-and-mix,choose-your-news nature of modern mediamay be contributing to a terrifying problem at the worst possible time.If there’s no common framework, there can be no consensus commitments.Woodside’s proposed North West Shelf expansion represents an unacceptable climate risk in an Australia where dairy farms are drying out already – and the Albanese government, which has pushed so hard on renewables infrastructure, batteries and EVs from its first term, obviously knows this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the other end of the political spectrum, that’s what Trump’s doing. Going fast and breaking things results in a lot of broken things – a situation Australians find electorally unpalatable.The alternative obliged here is a nuanced, national conversation shared by the breadth of the electorate. When it comes to projects like the North West Shelf, there is a pressing need for the government to move on environmental protection reforms, but it can’t do it without all communities contributing to a shared conversation about risks and trade-offs.Neither glib lines nor warm thoughts can hide the cynicism of Labor’s North West Shelf decision | Clear AirRead moreAt the same time mounting environmental risks are causing increasingly lethal chaos, everyone has to understand where tens of thousands of jobs will be lost, what energy transitions do to investment returns and tax revenue, as well as our energy security relationships with importers like Japan and South Korea.Complaints are not solutions. Plans are.Where and howthat honest community conversation takes place is now the challenge. It demands a cultural humility the internet is unlikely to encourage. Overcoming the silos between rural experience, urban attention and the policy bunkers of government is hard, but it has to happen.We once valued the ABC as the instrument for this kind of national discussion, but as the broadcaster sheds shared forums like The Drum and Q+A, we’re staring down the reality of environmental disaster understood as niche programming.If a devastating drought only a couple of hours away has become unimaginable, perhaps the faraway place called the future has already become impossible.Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionDroughtFarmingcommentShareReuse this content"

No wonder the birthrate is fallingWed 11 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 06.47 EDTShareEveryone told me “the juggle” would get easier when my daughter started reception this year. It was, quite simply, a lie. As any parent of a school-aged child will tell you they’re hardly ever there.Mothers started exchanging panicked messages about the summer holiday in our class WhatsApp group in May, sharing links to clubs and childcare options they’ve already booked, which all look terrible, and possibly worse than just juggling it all at home. And I only have one child. This week,a UN reportrevealed that millions of people around the world are not having as many children as they would like, and I know why: yes, it’s “the high cost of parenthood”, and for many of us a big part of that is paying for something to do with your offspring when school is not looking after them.One option is a gymnastic “camp” – which is out of town, only a week long, and finishes by 3pm. I could thrust my five-year-old into a new hobby, but would it really be worth it for just a week? What about the otherfiveof the summer holidays? Assuming I work from home, with a 9am drop-off, I could be back at my desk by 9.45 but then I would have to leave again by 2.30, which hardly seems worth it. By the time we’d got into the swing of things, the camp would have ended and I’d need a new sport lined up to take its place the following Monday.View image in fullscreenChildren at a summer camp in the Netherlands, July 2023.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/ShutterstockA few school mums say they’ve booked in with a local private school, over the English border from where I live in Wales. There’s a PE teacher running something open to nearby schools, which also doesn’t cover the whole holiday and would cost a fortune.The money isn’t really the issue though, because even if you have money, there’s nowhere to go and even the terrible options are always booked up fast. It’s not like there’s an amazing solution and it’s just out of reach – there’s truly just nothing available. And the au pair system waskilled by Brexit, so that’s not an option any longer either.The problem is, there’s more school leave than parents are legally entitled to take from work, and we’re living in a two-income economy. If two parents added both of their 5.6 weeks of leave together, and were guaranteed the leave they asked for, it still wouldn’t cover the amount of school holiday – and that’s assuming they never took any time off together as a family. The school calendar hasn’t been updated since it was created in the Victorian era, when the way we worked and parented looked very different. To top it all, this generation of boomer grandparents don’t want to help either, because they want to “enjoy retirement” and go on holidays instead.The standard of parenting expected of us is like nothing history has ever seen. Even when families did have two working parents, like in my family, no one took time off work to look after the kids. They just didn’t look after them. My grandparents would both work and leave my dad to find his own fun until dinner time, but today we would (rightly) call that child neglect. Once he was hit by a car, because he was too young to know you have to look both ways when crossing the road. He was on his way to the beach, with another child, to sail a raft he’d built.In the sea.And in my experience,it’s a gendered issue. I haven’t seen any dads in the chat talking about solutions, because for most of them, it’s not a problem. They get to go off and do their work, and attend their conferences, without worrying about it. They don’t get frantic calls from their wives asking them to troubleshoot childcare problems if they dare try to leave the house.Children to have free bus travel in west of England during summer holidaysRead moreEven part-time jobs arenot properly designed for parents. Part-timers who work three days a week will only be entitled to 16.8 days of leave and the school holidays take up to 13 weeks. And that’s before we get into the inset days and sick days, and who covers them? (It’s mothers; it’s me.)It doesn’t have to be this way. In other countries, like the US, they shove their children off to overnight camps for nine to 12 weeks at a time. It’s not a perfect solution, but at least people can stay employed. The French, as always, seem to have it right by just taking off for the summer with their gorgeous annual leave.The most workable solution I’ve seen isAmazon’s “term-time” contract, which allows parents to take 10 weeks of leave a year while keeping a full-time job, with a combination of paid and unpaid holiday leave. They’ve been running the scheme since 2023, and the companyhasn’t crashed and burnedyet. If only more companies could see the benefits – which include a diverse workforce filled with mothers with a host of skills companies are missing out on.Childcare is infrastructure. Just like we need roads, a public health system and transport, the country needs a childcare solution. Today’s children will pay for your pensions, provide your healthcare and build your roads. But only if we make it possible for people to keep having them.Rhiannon Picton-James is a freelance journalist and opinion writer.

It’s time for the EU to catch onWed 11 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 12.21 EDTShareAs Europeans woke up to the joy of travel post-lockdown, it looked as though we were in store for aresurgenceof continent-crossing night trains. Sleeper train fans hailed a “night train renaissance” and a “rail revolution”, combining some of the nostalgia for an old way of travelling with modern climate and sustainable transport concerns.The long-distance European train journey might be slower than a short-haul flight, but it is surely better in terms of the environment and the traveller experience. For those on a budget, the prospect of saving on a night in a hotel appeals too.But as anyone who has tried to plan a holiday train trip for this summer is likely to have found, night trains are still few and far between, especially in western Europe. And if there is a night train at all on a route, it will often be booked up months in advance. That’s not all: reliability and onboard service are often not up to scratch, with carriages on many routes pushing 50 years old.The traditional behemoths of European rail – France’s SNCF, Germany’s Deutsche Bahn and Spain’s Renfe – have little or no interest in the night-train market, preferring more profitable high-speed daytime trains instead. Only Austria’s ÖBB has bucked the trend, ordering a fleet of33 new trainsfor its Nightjet service. For comparison, Deutsche Bahn ownsalmost 300high-speed daytime trains. Night services remain a drop in the ocean.Now Nox, a Berlin-based private startup, hasannounced plansit claims will change all that and blow open the night-train market with a radical rethink of the passenger experience. No more old or secondhand carriages; Nox says it intends to build a new fleet. No more asking travellers to share with snoring strangers in couchettes either: the fleet will have only one- and two-person compartments, albeit rather small ones. Pilot services are due to start in 2027 and regular operations by the end of the decade.This approach on the key question is right – the only way to offer more night-train routes is to build new trains. But Nox will not be the first newcomer to try to crack this market. Midnight Trains, a Paris-based startup, promisedhotels on wheelsin 2021, but investors were not convinced and theventure folded. Dutch operation GoVolta hasbeen unableto turn a successful air-package travel business into the equivalent on rail.European Sleeper, which also launched in 2021, has done a little better – its motley collection of elderly carriages runs three times a week from Brussels via Amsterdam and Berlin to Prague, but without new carriages the company will remain tiny.View image in fullscreenThe view from the European Sleeper, which goes from Brussels to Prague.Photograph: PRWhile Nox, like its predecessors, faces an uphill struggle, in a few ways it is different. Its plan to rethink the layout of a night-train carriage, making it more appealing to modern travellers – and safer for women – makes sense. Standardisation - all the carriages will be the same - keeps operations simple. One of the founders previously worked for FlixBus’s rail arm, FlixTrain, in Germany, so there is genuine railway experience. Either way, UK passengers should not hold their breath – night trains through the Channel Tunnel are not on the cards, being operationally too difficult to even contemplate.Efforts by any private operator to solve the night-train puzzle are welcome, but the problem ultimately is political. And as most European countries are too small for national night trains, that means solving these issues EU wide. The European Commission, in a2021 report, flagged a dozen routes where night trains would make economic sense but currently do not run. Yet, in the years since then, no action has been taken.It turns out you’re never too old to go Interrailing around Europe | Phil MongredienRead moreBrussels is steadily working to harmonise diverging national rules that make running international trains such a hassle. But night trains – locomotive hauled, medium speed and running at night when track capacity is easier to obtain – arguably face fewer hurdles than other train types.It is time for the EU to provide financial guarantees for acquisitions of new night-train carriages, and make those guarantees available to both privately owned and state-owned companies. With at least half a dozen train manufacturers in the EU it could be a boon to European industry as well. And the requirement from the commission in return would be Europe-wide compatibility – that guarantees would only be for go-anywhere carriages that can be deployed anywhere from Barcelona to Bodø, Stockholm to Sofia.So, this summer, as you stand in interminable queues at an airport, or stare at the bumper of the car ahead of you in a traffic jam, remember that all of this could be better. A night-train renaissance could get you to your holiday destination more comfortably and more sustainably.The EU’s actions on international rail lag behind its rhetoric. Building more night-train carriages to run more services on tracks already there should be a no brainer.Jon Worth is an independent campaigner and writer about European railwaysExplore more on these topicsRail travelOpinionEuropeTransport policyEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

We are at a loss for words right now. Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world. Love & Mercy.”Brian Wilson: a life in picturesRead moreAs the leading creative force in theBeach Boys,Wilsoncrafted a variously carefree and melancholy sound that came to define the uncertain utopianism of mid-century California. Using ambitious studio techniques to give the band’s music a thrilling grandeur, his songs about surfing, driving, girls and the pep of youth modulated to more reflective and often psychedelic material, resulting in one of the most highly regarded catalogues of American song. The Beach Boys’ 1966 album Pet Sounds – written and produced almost entirely by Wilson – is seen not only as the group’s masterpiece, but for many is the greatest album of all time.Wilson was born in Inglewood, southern California, in 1942. A natural musician with perfect pitch who could sing back phrases sung to him as a baby, he learned piano as he and his younger brothers Carl and Dennis fell in love with R&B, rock’n’roll, doo-wop and pop. Despite going partly deaf in one ear (possibly as a result of an attack by a local boy), he and Carl joined their cousin Mike Love to form the high school group Carl and the Passions, later bringing in Dennis and friend Al Jardine to form the Pendletones. They had been encouraged by Wilson’s father Murry, with whom Wilson had a complex relationship – he later said Murry was also physically abusive to him.Wilson’s first song for the group, soon renamed theBeach Boys, was 1961’s Surfin’ – the first in a series of Wilson-penned hits such as Surfin’ Safari, Surfer Girl and Surfin’ USA, the latter reaching No 3 on the US charts and cementing their breakthrough.View image in fullscreenThe Beach Boys in 1964.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesWilson graduated to producer, as well as songwriter, for third album Surfer Girl, and powered the group through an astonishingly high work rate, releasing 15 albums before the end of the 1960s. Wilson’s ambition meant that he strove not to be boxed in as a novelty band who sang about surfing and cars, and deepened the band’s songcraft – including on Pet Sounds, which was conceived as an overarching statement rather than a series of discrete songs, its complex arrangements featuring everything from orchestral instruments to Coca-Cola bottles.Wilson began using cannabis and LSD, and said the latter was creatively useful – he wrote a signature Beach Boys song, California Girls, while on his first trip, and said acid allowed him to “come to grips with what you are, what you can do [and] can’t do”. But his drug use, coupled with his intense workload, likely exacerbated mental health problems that had started when he was a teenager suffering from anxiety.He heard voices in his head, spent time in psychiatric hospitals during the late 1960s, and became somewhat isolated from his bandmates. Wilson would eventually be diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and mild manic depression. He said in 2019: “There were times when [his mental illness] was unbearable but with doctors and medications I have been able to live a wonderful, healthy and productive life.”The Beach Boys’ 40 greatest songs – ranked!Read moreAmid his difficulties, Pet Sounds’ follow-up Smile was never completed (though was later adapted into a 2004 solo album, and the original recordings eventually released as The Smile Sessions in 2011). His bandmates began to contribute more to the songwriting, though Wilson compositions still occasionally featured as the group emerged from a commercial downturn at the close of the decade to record the acclaimed Sunflower and Surf’s Up albums (the latter’s title track a psychedelic return by Wilson to his earlier fixation).View image in fullscreenBrian Wilson in the studio.After the death of his father, the early 70s were a low period for Wilson, as his drug intake increased and he became isolated once more. He came back into the Beach Boys fold for 1976 album 15 Big Ones, but descended again into alcoholism, drug abuse and overeating towards the end of the decade; he also endured the death of Dennis who drowned in 1983. Closely controlled by psychologist Eugene Landy, his equilibrium improved in the 1980s, and, having finally split from the Beach Boys, he released his self-titled debut solo album in 1988.The early 1990s was another fractious period: Wilson was extricated from his arrangement with Landy – who had become a songwriting collaborator, and got himself added to Wilson’s will via a conservatorship agreement – with a restraining order filed against Landy. Wilson was sued by his mother, Carl, Love and Jardine for defamatory statements in his 1991 memoir, and again by Love the following year over royalties, which was found in favour of Love.Wilson continued to tour and release occasional solo albums, and eventually reunited with the Beach Boys in 2011 (now without Carl, who died in 1998) for a tour and the album That’s Why God Made the Radio. The group split once more, with Love touring under the band’s name and Wilson and Jardine separately touring together, including for a 50th anniversary Pet Sounds tour in 2016.Wilson sold his publishing rights to Universal for $50m in 2021 and played his final concert as part of a joint tour with Chicago a year later. In 2024, it wasannouncedthat Wilson had dementia and months later a judgeplacedhim in conservatorship.Wilson was married twice, first to Marilyn Rovell in 1964, with whom he had two daughters, Carnie and Wendy (who later formed a vocal group of their own, Wilson Phillips, and scored three US No 1 singles). Wilson and Rovell divorced in 1979. In 1995, he married Melinda Kae Ledbetter, who he first began dating in 1986 and who also became his manager. They adopted five children together. Melinda died in January 2024.Twelve of Brian Wilson’s greatest songs – from surf to psychedelia and beyondRead moreIn addition to his 1991 and 2016 memoirs, Wilson’s story has also been told in a 2014 biopic,Love & Mercy, starring Paul Dano and John Cusack, and a 2021 documentary, Brian Wilson: Long Promised Road.CusackrememberedWilson online today. “The maestro has passed - the man was a open heart with two legs - with an ear that heard the angels,” he wrote on X. “Quite literally. Love and Mercy for you and yours tonight. RIP Brian.”Ronnie Wood also paid tribute on social media,writing“my world is in mourning” while Mick Fleetwoodwrotethat he was “greatly saddened” by the news. “Anyone with a musical bone in their body must be grateful for Brian Wilson’s genius magical touch,” he added.In a lengthy Instagram tribute, Questlovewrote: “If there was a human being who made art out of inexpressible sadness … damn it was Brian Wilson.”Sean Lennonposted: “Not many people influenced me as much as he did. I feel very lucky that I was able to meet him and spend some time with him. He was always very kind and generous. He was our American Mozart.”Nancy Sinatra alsoshareda tribute on Instagram. “His cherished music will live forever as he travels through the universe and beyond,” she wrote. “God bless you, sweet Brian.”Explore more on these topicsBrian WilsonBeach BoysPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

Those references have become important in my work’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 11 Jun 2025 10.41 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 13.43 EDTShareIwas raised in a single-parent household by my mum and we’re very close. She is a nurse, but she also did a lot of flower-arranging. I would often go to hang around the florists with her and her arrangements were always around the house. When I was a kid she was also a Sunday school teacher and would run arts and crafts workshops at church. I think I began to appreciate colour, how to match things, and develop taste, from there. My sister also studied fashion – and I was always in her bedroom as that’s where I would go to watch TV. She would have all these posters from Dazed and Vogue, Nick Knight photographs, pictures of Naomi Campbell. I thought it was rubbish at the time, but in hindsight I can understand how those references have become important.This image was the cover of my book, Regina, which was a massive moment in my career, featuring all the work I have done up to now, aged 26. A lot of it, and the way I see the world in general, is down to the women in my life. This image was an opportunity to celebrate them and show the strength of motherhood.My mum allowed me to see life in pink, regardless of our situation – something I always want to pay homage to. She always told me she knew from very early on, from when I was in the womb, everything I would do, to this day. I believe that our lives are written before we are even born. This image speaks to those things, to new life. I’ve always felt as if my life is like a movie.We used a prosthetic belly in the shoot. I had wanted to cast someone who was pregnant, but we weren’t able to do that in the timeframe, but I felt it was an important image to make in spite of that. There’s a strength I always want to show – a lot of my inspiration comes from old family photographs of my grandparents looking super proud, wearing their traditional Nigerian clothes.A lot went into the beautiful, bold simplicity of this moment – I can only take so much creditMy images are fashion but I always want to show the cultural resonances of those poses, the way people express themselves. I encourage everyone I work with to express themselves in a way that they feel is genuine. Each shoot is a mashup of everyone’s efforts, and I’m proud of that. A lot went into the beautiful, bold simplicity of this moment. I can only take so much credit.From the second I decided to pick up a camera I knew that fashion was the best medium for me to express myself. There are no limits, it’s all possibilities – which is what I am most attracted to. I do feel a responsibility, as a Black photographer, to create timeless work. One day I’ll raise Black daughters, and I will need to explain things to them, and the role I played in the way they see themselves.The titles I give my works are all possible names for my future daughters. Selah came from my mum reading me the Book of Psalms before I went to sleep. I’m also a fan of Lauryn Hill, who named her daughter Selah. I chose Regina as the title of the series and the book because I wanted something that had that meaning of queen, of someone regal, without individually naming those women in my life that the work is for.I have always had confidence in my ability to create a good image that is challenging and doesn’t just conform to the industry standards. I’ve been creating my own audience so I don’t have to worry what everyone else thinks. I’ve been unapologetic from the outset and I feel like people understand what I’m trying to do. But havingsuch a big show in Londonaged 26 is insane. Coming through the space, I felt exhausted and I wondered when I found the time to do all this stuff. It’s great this exhibition is happening in my home city too – I’ll never get used to the idea of people leaving the house to go and look at my work on a wall. I generally don’t ask my mum or my sister about what they think of my work, but my mum was at the opening, and I asked her for the first time how she felt about it. She said: “I’m not surprised at all. It’s what I’ve been praying for.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Parry/PAGabriel Moses CVBorn:London, 1998Trained:Self-taughtInfluences:“My mum.”High point:“My first picture.”Low point:“Manchester United losing the 2011 Champions League final.”Top tip:“Never stop asking questions.”Gabriel Moses – Selah is at180 Studios, London,until 27 July.Explore more on these topicsPhotographyMy best shotArtBlack British culturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a road movie which is partly about the Holocaust and about America’s third-generation attempt at coming to terms with it, at confronting what their parents and grandparents found too painfully recent to revisit, or necessary to forget in order to survive. And partly it’s about family, male friendship and growing older.”Read the full review.The Girl With the NeedleFictionalised true crime nightmare based on Denmark’s 1921 baby-killer case, directed by Magnus von Horn, that leaves a shiver of pure fear.What we said: “It is about a world in which women’s lives are disposable and in which the authorities are disapproving of and disgusted by their suffering – and set at a time in which the first world war had normalised the idea of mass murder.”Read the full review.MariaAngelina Jolie’s Callas commands the screen in Pablo Larraín’s strange and mordant drama that portrays the diva’s haughty struggle as her voice begins to fail but her stardom remains undimmed.What we said: “Maria is the most persuasive and seductive of Larraín’s trilogy of great women at bay, after Jackie about Jackie Kennedy, and Spencer about Princess Diana. There is less sentimentality and self-importance to this one though, for all that it is about the biggest diva in history.​”Read the full review.PepeView image in fullscreenCoca colonialism … PepePhotograph: MubiHuge and wayward docu-fictional meditation goes inside inside the beautiful mind of Pablo Escobar’s hippo, shipped out to furnish the Colombian druglord’s estate.What we said: “The hippo, as a German tour guide tells us at the very beginning, may look fat and placid and rather cute, but it’s fast-moving, aggressive and dangerous to humans; perhaps the film itself, so mysteriously distended with huge digressions and non-narrative scenes, is as exotically fleshy and strange as a hippo. Yet it has bite.”Read the full review.VermiglioMaura Delpero’s beautifully made drama explores the complex dynamics of a sprawling family in an idyllic Italian village near the wartime border with Germany.What we said: “It is wonderfully acted with unaffected naturalism by its cast of professionals and newcomers and plays an extravagant, almost shameless pizzicato on the audience’s heartstrings.”Read the full review.A Complete UnknownJames Mangold’s biopic of Bob Dylan follows the rise of the era-defining star with Timothée Chalamet brilliantly embodying his shapeshifting allure.What we said: “Chalamet is a hypnotic Dylan, performing the tracks himself and fabricating to a really impressive degree that stoner-hungover birdsong. He does a very passable version of Don’t Think Twice, with the distinctive, eccentric intonations, singing as if he’s not entirely sure of the tune and appearing to run out of breath at the end of every line.”Read the full review.The BrutalistView image in fullscreenGrand designs … Adrien Brody in The Brutalist.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyEpic postwar architectural drama with Adrien Brody as a Hungarian Holocaust survivor who comes to the US and begins a distinguished career under the patronage of a wealthy man.What we said: “This is a film with thrilling directness and storytelling force, a movie that fills its widescreen and three-and-a-half-hour running time with absolute certainty and ease, as well as glorious amplitude, clarity and even simplicity – and yet also with something darkly mysterious and uncanny to be divined in its handsome shape.”Read the full review.Blue Road: The Edna O’Brien StoryOne of Ireland’s most important novelists and a woman of fierce intelligence and bravery is celebrated in Sinéad O’Shea’s thoroughly enjoyable documentary.What we said: “This portrait of the author Edna O’Brien is a reminder that most writers – most people, in fact – don’t have lives anywhere near as exciting or fulfilling as hers.”Read the full review.Hard TruthsMarianne Jean-Baptiste is exceptional as a woman in the terrifying endgame of depression in this deeply sober and compassionate drama, a Mike Leigh classic of day-to-day disillusionment and courage.What we said: “It reunites Leigh with that overwhelmingly powerful female lead, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, whose name was made by her electrifying performance in Leigh’s 1996 film Secrets and Lies, and might well get made all over again with her formidable appearance here, demonstrating the terrible connection between depression and anger.”Read the full review.The Seed of the Sacred FigExiled director Mohammad Rasoulof’s arresting tale of Iran’s violence and paranoia, and officialdom’s misogyny and theocracy, whose importance is beyond doubt.What we said: “The Seed of the Sacred Fig begins as a downbeat political and domestic drama in the familiar style of Iranian cinema, and then progressively escalates to something extravagantly crazy and traumatised – like a pueblo shootout by Sergio Leone.”Read the full review.View image in fullscreenTense … September 5.Photograph: Jürgen OlczykSeptember 5Taut media procedural revisits Munich Olympics in Tim Fehlbaum’s tense thriller focusing on the 1972 terrorist massacre through a TV crew lens.What we said: “It’s a really smart, involving, unassumingly written picture with something of James L Brooks’ Broadcast News and I couldn’t help think that maybe this is the film that Steven Spielberg could have made rather than Munich, his rather ponderous, Forsythian thriller about the aftermath.”Read the full review.To a Land UnknownMahdi Fleifel’s tale of displacement and desperation as Palestinian refugees seek a better life makes for suspenseful, melancholic viewing.What we said: “Mahmood Bakri’s excellent performance shows Chatila to be smart, personable, manipulative and ruthless, always on the lookout for ways to get money for a fake passport.”Read the full review.Memoir of a SnailSarah Snook and Kodi Smit-McPhee lend their voice talents to Adam Elliott’s ambitious animation, a charming, poignant tale of troubled twins that has a strong personal touch.What we said: “There’s an ingenuousness and innocence to Memoir of a Snail, a family-entertainment approachability that belies a strange intensity. There are some candid hints, through the obviously personal narrative touches, that in this film some very real adult pain and anger is being hidden in plain sight.”Read the full review.I Am Martin ParrEnjoyable and valuable study of tragicomic Britain’s inspired photographer, whose highly coloured 70s and 80s images revealed the white working class as never before.What we said: “The film shows that part of his skill is just looking like an ordinary bloke, going around in the crowd with his wheeled walking frame (after recent illness), smiling benignly, endlessly taking pictures.”Read the full review.View image in fullscreenTerrific fun … Superboys of Malegaon.Photograph: Amazon MGM StudiosSuperboys of MalegaonInspired by a true story, this feelgood Indian film is about some Bollywood superfans making their own movies with a cheeky but admirable DIY ethos.What we said: “There is terrific fun, charm and storytelling energy in Superboys of Malegaon, and it settles on an interesting theme: very rarely indeed does a new film-maker find success with a completely original work.”Read the full review.Ernest Cole: Lost & FoundTragic story of a fiercely pioneering photographer, a black South African whose work illuminated the reality of life under apartheid, but who lived a life of exile and homesickness.What we said: “Raoul Peck’s film, in which LaKeith Stanfield narrates a kind of heightened, fictionalised first-person account from Cole’s own writings and diaries, is devastatingly sad. It is the sadness of an artist who becomes estranged, not merely from his homeland, but from his art and his livelihood.”Read the full review.On FallingView image in fullscreenQuietly excellent… Joana Santos in On Falling.Photograph: Sixteen FilmsLaura Carreira’s impressive debut drama sees a quietly excellent Joana Santos endure dehumanising work conditions an online warehouse worker while looking for a way out.What we said: “On Falling shows us a world of sadness and exhaustion, a kind of heavy cloud cover of depression that is both a symptom of the job and a way of getting through it: only by reducing yourself to zombie-like inattention to your own needs can you get through the day as a ‘picker’.”Read the full review.Sister MidnightMumbai-set comic horror with Radhika Apte terrific as a woman preparing to settle down with a shiftless husband she barely knows when her world goes awry.What we said: “With its deadpan drollery and rectilinear tableau scenes, Sister Midnight takes something from Wes Anderson and Jim Jarmusch and also – at its most alarming – something more from Polanski’s Repulsion.”Read the full review.The Rule of Jenny PenGeoffrey Rush’s retired judge is terrorised by John Lithgow’s therapy puppet-wielding fellow resident in this claustrophobic care-home thriller of elder-on-elder abuse.What we said: “Film-maker James Ashcroft has created a scary and intimately upsetting psychological horror based on a story by New Zealand author Owen Marshall, a film whose coolly maintained claustrophobic mood and bravura performances make up for the slight narrative blurring towards the end.”Read the full review.SantoshTerrifically tense cop movie digs into sexism and caste prejudice in India, Sunita Rajwar and Shahana Goswami as a cynical veteran and a wide-eyed rookie who has inherited her late husband’s job.What we said: “Writer-director Sandhya Suri has made a tense, violent and politically savvy crime procedural set in India: a film about sexism, caste bigotry and Islamophobia that doubles as a study in the complex relationship between two female cops.”Read the full review.View image in fullscreenThe last super-rich couple in the world … Tilda Swinton and Michael Shannon in The End.Photograph: Felix Dickinson/NeonThe EndTilda Swinton and Michael Shannon go to ground in a survival bunker with their son, in Joshua Oppenheimer’s end-of-the-world singalong drama.What we said: “What Oppenheimer is doing here commands attention. He is facing something from which everyone, in art as in life, averts their gaze and the resulting film is far better than others notionally on the same subject.”Read the full review.The Stimming PoolDocufiction by a group of young film-makers on the spectrum examining how their creativity and sense of self is shaped by autism is funny and pregnant with ideas.What we said: “The collective’s members finally come together in an empty swimming pool, which becomes their own “stimming pool”, symbolising their collective innovation. It’s an intriguing and atmospheric piece of work.”Read the full review.One to One: John & YokoView image in fullscreenDifferent flavour of fab … Still from the film Bed Peace, 1970, featured in One to One: John & Yoko.Photograph: Nic Knowland © 1970 Yoko Ono LennonA collection of staggering TV clips and amazing audio of Lennon and Ono’s life in 1970s NYC, Kevin Macdonald’s immersive collage is a pop culture fever dream.What we said: “It’s a film that mixes small screen zeitgeist fragments and madeleine moments, a memory quilt of a certain time and place, juxtaposing Jerry Rubin and Allen Ginsberg with Richard Nixon and George Wallace, John and Yoko in concert with ads for Tupperware.”Read the full review.The ReturnJuliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes star in Uberto Pasolini’s raw and urgent Odyssey adaptation, as a traumatised Odysseus faces the shameful aftermath of war.What we said: “An elementally violent movie about PTSD, survivor guilt, abandonment, Freudian dysfunction and ruined masculinity.”Read the full review.Pink Floyd at Pompeii MCMLXXIIMesmerically peculiar portrait of the band performing in the burning Italian sun in this outrageously indulgent yet vivid and beguiling music documentary.What we said: “The music and the atmosphere are an irresistible fan-madeleine for those who can remember referring to them solemnly as ‘the Floyd’ (ahem).”Read the full review.AprilShocking violence is tempered by strange, silent sequences in Dea Kulumbegashvili’s haunting abortion drama, which has echoes of The Piano Teacher.What we said: “This is not the usual ‘abortion’ issue movie in which the reactionary anti-abortion authorities are straightforwardly criticised and the pregnant woman is awarded compassionate centre stage status.”Read the full review.Julie Keeps QuietA star player at an elite tennis school decides to stay silent when the head coach is suspended in Leonardo Van Dijl’s absorbing movie.What we said: “A tense, absorbing movie of silences and absences, of difficult terrain skirted around, of subjects avoided. It’s a reminder that in key situations, to keep quiet is a stressful, strenuous and, crucially, public activity – and a survival instinct that many young people have to learn.”Read the full review.Where Dragons LiveWarm documentary from Dutch film-maker Suzanne Raes following three siblings as they clear out their enormously grand childhood home in Oxfordshire, where among the happy memories are those of cruelty.What we said: “Maybe it takes a non-British film-maker to appreciate such intense and unfashionable Englishness; not eccentric exactly, but wayward and romantic.”Read the full review.Ocean With David AttenboroughView image in fullscreenReady for a closeup … A sheepshead wrasse in a kelp forest in California in Ocean With David Attenborough.Photograph: National Geographic/PAReleased on his 99th birthday and presented in the context of his remarkable career, Attenborough’s passionate case against the ruination of the seas is matched only by nature’s grandeur in this visually stunning film.What we said: “He shows us an amazing vista of diversity and life, an extraordinary undulating landscape, a giant second planet of whose existence humanity has long been unaware but now seems in danger of damaging or even destroying.”Read the full review.RiefenstahlNauseating yet gripping story of Nazi poster woman who entranced Hitler, directed Triumph of the Will – and spent the rest of her life alternately fearful and defiant.What we said: “This documentary shows she revised her memoirs endlessly, unsure if or how to minimise her personal contact with the Nazis, especially the sinister, besotted Joseph Goebbels; her fear of war guilt was at loggerheads with her unrepentant impulse to proclaim her own prestige.”Read the full review.A New Kind of WildernessBeautiful film of an off-grid family shattered by bereavement who had to come to terms with not just the loss of a parent but a whole lifestyle.What we said: “Norwegian film-maker Silje Evensmo Jacobsen tells a painful, complicated story, more complicated than even the film itself explicitly reveals.”Read the full review.View image in fullscreenOutstanding … Good OneGood OneLily Collias is outstanding as 17-year-old Sam, who goes hiking with her dad and his best buddy in India Donaldson’s intelligent and humane feature debut.What we said: “Donaldson sets a low-key tone of banter and backtalk, in which Sam has to ride in the back of her Subaru, making herself carsick by checking her phone and annoying her dad by asking if she can drive; he finds it annoying because she is actually a better driver than he is.”Read the full review.Hallow RoadShot almost entirely inside a car, Rosamund Pike and Matthew Rhys play a splintering couple trying to save their terrified teenage daughter in a cracking thriller.What we said: “A gripping, real-time suspense thriller with a twist of the macabre, a film about family guilt and the return of the repressed.”Read the full review.Mission Impossible – The Final ReckoningTom Cruise signs off with wildly entertaining adventure in this eighth and last Mission: Impossible, as agent Ethan Hunt takes on the ultimate in AI evil.What we said: “Final Reckoning is a new and ultimate challenge (actually the second half of the challenge from the previous film) which takes Cruise’s buff and resourceful IMF leader Ethan Hunt on one last maverick, deniable mission to exasperate and yet overawe his stuffed-shirt superiors at Washington and Langley. And what might that be? To save the world of course, like all the other missions.”Read the full review.MountainheadView image in fullscreenGreat bunch of bros … Cory Michael Smith, Steve Carell, Ramy Youssef and Jason Schwartzman in Mountainhead.Photograph: HBOWeapons-grade zingers come thick and fast in Jesse Armstrong’s post-Succession uber-wealth satire about four plutocrats on a weekend away in a lodge that goes awry when the planet descends into chaos.What we said: “More than any comedy or even film I’ve seen recently, this is movie driven by the line-by-line need for fierce, nasty, funny punched-up stuff in the dialogue, and narrative arcs and character development aren’t the point. But as with Succession, this does a really good job of persuading you that, yes, this is what our overlords are really like.”Read the full review.Share your favouriteYou can tell us your favourite film of the year so far using this form.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Recognisable faces such asKatherine Parkinson(Molly Weasley), Johnny Flynn (Lucius Malfoy) and Daniel Rigby (Vernon Dursley) have been joined by the newcomers Leo Earley, Alessia Leoni and Sienna Moosah. Well, RIP their mentions.We have been here before – recently and often. Harry Potter has become such a febrile battleground that the pattern has already become well worn. When John Lithgow was announced as Dumbledore, he revealed that a friend had sent hima link to an articleentitled: “An open letter to John Lithgow: Please walk away from Harry Potter.”This is only the tip of the iceberg. When Nick Frost was named as the new Hagrid – a role he claims to have manifested by writing down the word “Hagrid” 5,000 times – he quickly had to disable comments on Instagram, thengave an interviewin which he said that his opinions “don’t align in any way, shape or form” with those of JK Rowling. Paapa Essiedu attempted to get in front of the controversy by signinga petitioncalling for the UK entertainment industry to protect trans people, but this didn’t shield him from criticism. All three actors have tried to ameliorate the controversy in their own way; all three have been criticised anyway.But this is the predicament we find ourselves in. A few years ago, announcing yourself as the star of aHarry Potterseries would have simply told the world that you had decided to receive a lot of money over many years from a studio that had a dearth of new ideas. But, in 2025, a Harry Potter actor isn’t just taking a job on a TV show; they are making a political statement, whether they like it or not.As such, this week’s announcement of the new cast members was met with weary sighs on social media. Parkinson has come in for especially sustained attacks, given that her breakout role was in The IT Crowd, made by Graham Linehan, who is on the same side as Rowling when it comes to gender.Presumably, Parkinson doesn’t spend her days Googling the screenwriter of every script she receives to see if they are trans-exclusionary. But now she – and the other actors named on Monday, plus anyone even tangentially associated with Harry Potter – is under pressure to declare a side. In short, the whole thing is a mess.This isn’t going to go away any time soon. It’s more than a year until the Harry Potter series airs, which means it won’t finish for at least a decade. Lithgow has said it will probably be his final major role, since he will be pushing 90 by the time it wraps. Every time anything of note happens – any time there is a junket or a new actor is cast – the issue will be front and centre. The actors who oppose Rowling will be forced to do it over and over again. The same goes for the ones who agree with her. The ones who just want a quiet life will twist themselves into knots trying to say as little as possible in the face of direct questioning. There is no outrunning this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maybe you will watch it because you loved it as a child and can overlook Rowling’s views (or support them). Maybe you won’t because you don’t want to financially aid Rowling, or because the thought of sitting through a decade-long third retelling of a story you never liked much in the first place makes you feel depressed and exhausted. Either way, your mind has been made up. What we are left with is a show that is too big to ignore.

Is that the problem, or the point, of Greg Davies’ new show? Ostensibly, Full Fat Legend poses the question “What the hell am I?”, as theTaskmasterman looks past his professional title and family roles to reveal the true Greg beneath. Practically, that means a retread of Davies’ life from 1970s Shropshire via a brief teaching career and nascent celebrity, and around more adventures in poo, pee and wanking than you’d wish on anybody.You might marvel that a 57-year-old’s gaze remains so directed at the navel, and below. But 12-year-old in a (very) outsized body has always beenDavies’ shtick. I found the fixation on bums and willies a bit much in this latest offering, perhaps because it goes on so long. But if, after six decades, Davies’ sense of humour remains juvenilely self-absorbed, at least he has the good grace to acknowledge it, and the craft to often turn it to fine comic effect. See the “face full of new freckles” image-making that accompanies one anecdote about attempting to clean his “baggy bumhole”.That’s one of several humiliating stories that demonstrate – according to Davies – that he’s not, in fact, a legend, but a complete chump instead. Others include tales of sleepless life with a swollen prostate, and of “dick-dialling” by accident a prominent government minister. We also get the explanation for why Davies turned out this way, with reference to the unreconstructed world of his youth (“It was a different time. It was an awful time”), when parental love was tough and sex education came via the Freemans lingerie catalogue.A lot of that material feels familiar, but Davies brings great gusto to its revival. Along the way, a handful of stories (one about an eccentric Irish “animal handler”; another about Danny Dyer) de-centre Davies and his ostentatious puerility, which can come as a relief. It’s a show, finally, about one manchild’s struggle to get over himself, his neuroses and ego – and on this evidence, he still has some way to go.Touring until 11 AprilExplore more on these topicsComedyGreg DaviesreviewsShareReuse this content"

As Fire Island gets its mojo back, we celebrate the Speedos-wearing architect who defined its lookOliver WainwrightWed 11 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 00.06 EDTSharePosters advertising a “bear weekend” cling to the utility poles on Fire Island, punctuating the wooden boardwalks that meander through a lush dune landscape of beach grass and pitch pine. It’s not a celebration of grizzlies, by the looks of the flyers, but of large bearded men in small swimming trunks, bobbing in the pools and sprawled on the sundecks of mid-century modernist homes. You might also find them frolicking in the bushes of this idyllic car-free island, a nature reserve of an unusual kind that stretches in a 30-mile sliver of sand off the coast of Long Island in New York.Over the last century, Fire Island Pines, as the central square-mile section of this sandy spit is known, has evolved into something of a queer Xanadu. Now counting about 600 homes, it is a place of mythic weekend-long parties and carnal pleasure, a byword for bacchanalia and fleshy hedonism – but also simply a secluded haven where people can be themselves.He stole his first commission from another architect by seducing the clients – with whom he briefly formed a throuple“My most vivid memory of my first visit here in the late 90s is being able to hold my boyfriend’s hand in public without fear,” says Christopher Rawlins, architect and co-founder ofPines Modern, a non-profit dedicated to celebrating the modern architecture of the island. The palpable sense of community and liberation here is, he says, “what happens when people who are accustomed to a certain degree of fear no longer feel it.”That was even more the case forHorace Gifford, an architect who arrived here in 1960, aged 28 and bored with working in a dull office in Manhattan and determined to make his mark in the sand. Over the next two decades, the young Floridian would build 63 holiday homes here, channelling his native beach culture into a seductive vision of breezy, timber-framed modernism that would define the look of the Pines – and beach homes – for the rest of the century.View image in fullscreen‘You have 20 closets to come out of!’ … Murray Fishman’s house.Photograph: Bill MarisLong before the term sustainability was invented, Gifford’s houses were models of compact, light-touch living with the land. While others were building sprawling mansions in the Hamptons, Gifford encouraged his clients to reduce their footprints, strip away extraneous details, and submit to what Rawlins describes as “an artful form of camping”. Clad with planks of raw cedar inside and out, interspersing solid volumes with walls of glass, and crowned with angled roofs to “reach out and grab for light”, his homes felt at one with the island – and celebrated its sexually liberated way of life with voyeuristic relish.View image in fullscreenSpeedos and an attache case … Gifford.Photograph: (unknown)Few had heard of Gifford until Rawlins began digging in the archives for his seminal book,Fire Island Modernist, first published in 2013 and long out of print, but now expanded and updated with new photography and additional homes. Gifford had been criminally overlooked, in part thanks to his own criminal record, which had put him off ever applying for his architect’s licence, in a state where licensed professionals had to be “of good moral character”. Like many others of the period, Gifford was arrested during a police raid on Fire Island in 1965, in a dune cruising zone known as the Meat Rack. Such raids happened throughout the 60s, with police threatening felony sodomy charges for anyone who challenged their misdemeanour arrests. Names were published in newspapers and careers ground to a halt. “They would entrap and beat the crap out of the guys,” recalls one of Gifford’s clients in the book, “then drag them down the boardwalks and corral them at the harbour-front like dead fish!”Gifford’s arrest might have put paid to his professional licensure, but that didn’t hinder his success on Fire Island. He was a statuesque, charismatic blond, who had been voted “best looking boy” at school, and few could resist his charms. He turned heads as he strode down the beach from meeting to meeting, “wearing a Speedo and carrying an attache case”, as one amused client recalls. He once hosted an elegant black-tie party – where that was the only item of dress people wore.“He understood his power over people,” says Rawlins. And he started how he meant to go on. He stole his first Fire Island commission from another architect by seducing the clients, with whom he briefly formed a throuple. “He affected a quiet vulnerability,” recalls one college friend, who majored in psychology, and found Gifford a fascinating study. “But he was anything but. He was ferociously narcissistic.”View image in fullscreenLike stage sets … a Gifford interior.Photograph: Tom SibleyIt worked a charm with the press. A 1964 issue of The American Home magazine declared Gifford to be “undoubtedly the top beach-house designer in the country”. Another newspaper headline in 1968 cooed “He Sends Cutting Edges into the Sky”, while the New York Times singled out his work in a travelling exhibition of beach house architecture the same year. They highlightedhis treehouse-like designfor textile designer Murray Fishman, raised on a series of chunky wooden columns, which doubled up as hidden cupboards. As Gifford joked to Fishman: “You will now have 20 closets to come out of.”Sometimes the references were more risque. In a chapter titled Form Follows Foreplay, Rawlins describes how Gifford designeda fur-lined “make-out loft”for Stuart Roeder, a Warner Brothers’ PR man known for his wild parties. With its lusty loft suspended above a couch-rimmed conversation pit, the house provided a lurid backdrop for the 1970 pornographic film,The Fire Island Kids. A year later, the island provided the setting forBoys in the Sand, the first gay porn film to go mainstream, which cemented the Pines’ reputation as a place of “bronzed skin, stripped-bare facades of cedar and glass, flaxen hair, and shimmering pools,” as Rawlins writes.It was the perfect calling card for Gifford’s more raunchy work, which included homes with multi-man outdoor showers, bathrooms with big picture windows facing the boardwalks and “telescoping” interiors, choreographed like stage sets for the enjoyment (and enticement) of passersby. Gifford would even sometimes commission “peephole” style photographs of the interiors, as if to hint at the imminent indiscretions.As Fire Island’s reputation grew, so did the fame of its residents. In 1977, after divorcing his first wife, Calvin Kleinbought one of Gifford’s beachfront homes. He then hired the architect to convert it into a souped-up party pad, adding a black-lined pool, a “pool boy’s quarters”, a gym and a garden. “It was amazing,” Klein recalled in 2013, “the ultimate hedonist house. I mean, it was made for sex.” Following a series of unsympathetic additions, Rawlins is now busy restoring the house to its original splendour, as he has for anumber of other homes in the Pines.By the 1970s, Gifford’s designs had evolved from their humble beach shack origins. As the island’s foliage matured, the ground enriched by leaching septic tanks, he developed “upside down” floor plans that raised sunny living areas above shaded bedrooms. Budgets also grew. The owners of Broadway Maintenance, a lighting company, commissioned Lipkins House, a home thatpulsated along the beachfront with disco energy. Inside, a sunken living area led down to a windowless den lined with electric blue shag carpet and a mirrored ceiling, with lights that throbbed in time to the music. Its current owners are delighted with its ingenious details, like a hidden bar, cylindrical showers and clever sun-loungers that can be lifted out of the poolside wall, all still intact.View image in fullscreen‘Make-out loft’ … inside Stuart Roeder’s house.Photograph: Horace Gifford“We bought it just as Hurricane Sandy hit,” they tell me. “Both our neighbours lost their pools and their decks, but miraculously we were OK.” They look out at the beach, across a freshly planted protective sand berm, studded with clumps of new grass like a hair transplant. It was recently rebuilt,at a cost of $52m, after the previous $207m beach fortification – completed in 2019 and designed to withstand a 44-year storm event – waswashed away in just four years. “We shouldn’t even be allowed to have houses here,” the owner tells me, with a guilty look. “It’s a nature reserve. But the homes are ‘grand fathered’ in. When the hurricane hit, I thought, ‘My God, what have we done?’”Fire Island Pines has already been decimated once. Just as it reached its free-spirited, out-of-the-closet peak of liberation, Gifford’s generation was wiped out by Aids, the architect himself included, at the age of 59. The island became a ghostly place of mourning in the 1980s and 90s. But it is booming once again. House prices have rocketed, fuelled by the Covid pandemic and the arrival of high-speed internet, with the island’s fame boosted by a2022 romcombearing its name. Sexual freedom has also been turbo-charged once again by theadvent of PrEP, an HIV-preventive drug.Homes are getting bigger too, as new owners join lots together and bulldoze the quaint shacks of old, with an eye for lucrative short-term rentals. Watching the waves crash against the shore, as contractors drive piles for ever bigger, bloated beach houses, raised up on stilts against the floods, Gifford’s light-touch legacy looks just as fragile as ever.Explore more on these topicsArchitecturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’ve always been the dealer’Thomas HobbsHe’s already put out seven albums this year – a work ethic inherited, he says, from selling drugs in Detroit. But will we ever hear his tracks with the late great J Dilla?Wed 11 Jun 2025 06.15 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 12.18 EDTShareIn the brief window between my conversation withDetroitrapper Boldy James and you reading this sentence, it is likely that the 42-year-old MC will have surprise-released at least one new album on to streaming platforms. This year alone, he has already released seven records. A planned eighth is due in July, but who knows what might pop up in between.“My father always told me you’ve gotta work twice as hard because you can’t expect something for nothing in this life!” Boldy says of a work rate that can easily result in 20 new songs being completed in the studio over a 24-hour period. His combative verses, as cutting and direct as Don Corleone whispering instructions to a made man, have earned him critical adoration and elicited high-profile co-signs from hip-hop figureheads including Earl Sweatshirt, Nas, Westside Gunn, the late Mac Miller and producer the Alchemist, while fans are intrigued to know how he remains so prolific.Boldy calls his release strategy “flooding the market” – tactics he learned from his days caught up selling drugs on Detroit’s West Side. “My homie worked the track – which was a long stretch filled with junkies – from 3am to 6am. He might make $5,000 [£3,700] per night. It might have taken my dad a few months to earn that same cash, so I ended up doing it too. I’ve never been no sleepyhead. I used to sell drugs all night and then go to my class to take an exam. No problem.”Boldy describes his days selling narcotics on cold street corners with vivid cinematic flair: on the spooky new trap song Aspen, he jokes that his “Mexican plug” – slang for a prestigious international drugs source – looks a lot like the late civil rights activist Cesar Chavez. Is that true? Boldy laughs: “Allegedly.” He looks back on this part of his life as a reflection of his resourcefulness. “I never just settled for the cards life was dealing me,” he says. “I’ve always been more like the dealer.”A student of 1990s mafioso rap, a teenage Boldy fed off the confidence of artists such as the Notorious BIG and Erick Sermon. “I like it when men have firm handshakes and don’t whine too much,” he says. He started releasing music independently in the late 2000s, a sound built around warm nostalgia and sleepy depression. Boldy can be famously sedate in interviews, but today he’s lively and open.He usually works with a single producer per record, giving his albums an unusual cohesiveness in a collaboration-heavy genre. Produced by Detroit “sound healer” Sterling Toles, the soul stirring spiritual jazz sermon of Mommy Dearest (A Eulogy), one of Boldy’s most experimental songs, reflects on a childhood of serious neglect due to a mother lost to addiction. “Tellin’ me that you was on your way to come see me / And left me sittin’ on the porch in the rain, freezing,” he raps amid stuttery saxophone that can’t decide if it wants to soar or whimper.But when we talk, Boldy doesn’t want to reflect too much on that difficult past. It’s all in his music. He says his 2022 song Power Nap is among the finest examples of his lyricism. “We went from childhood dreams to federal nightmares” … “Six sleeper bags on the grass it’s a slumber party,” he raps, his vocals evoking those of Mobb Deep’s Prodigy as he burrows into unorthodox pockets of drumless soul-rap.“On one level, six sleeping bags makes you reminisce on your childhood and having those sleepovers to play Nintendo with all your friends, right?” he asks. “But it’s also because I could easily roll up the street and see six young Black males on the grass, laid out dead. I represent the hood struggle for real. No gimmicks.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve got a lot to lose’ … Boldy James.Photograph: Double Dee (@gametime_doubledee)Today, he cares most about showing his six children “the whole world,” he says. “I want to make sure I’m always sharing wisdom, because you can get took out at any moment. Right now I’m jumping out half a million dollar cars, wearing $400,000 [£300,000] worth of jewels. It means I’ve got a lot to lose.”‘Helping people survive’: how creating a hip-hop album supported incarcerated artistsRead moreTestament to Boldy’s stature is the fact that he’s sitting on an unreleased collaborative album with J Dilla rumoured to be called Drug Dilla. Boldy has previously said that the late Detroit beatmaker’s estate had given him access to some of the last beats the producer ever crafted – putting him among the small group of MCs (Busta Rhymes, Ghostface Killah, MF Doom, Phat Kat) to get posthumous approval from his camp.Boldy has said the album is finished, but I’m warned in advance not to ask about a release date. Yet he offers a telling answer on why his flow might fit so well over Dilla’s unconventional production. “I rap for real niggas who don’t care about club music. That’s more my lane. I got like a left-handed type of flow anyways, so not a lot of people can really bounce or groove to my shit. There’s a time and a place for my music.”Asked what that is, Boldy concludes: “It’s music made for people trying to process their past and turn it into a net positive. Play it on a road trip while driving to visit family. But I don’t expect everybody to relate either … because not everybody grew up around money and murder.”Boldy James and Nicholas Craven’s new single, Spider Webbing Windshields, is out now.

Decades later, onlyTaiwanstill stands its ground, “fending off the persistent aggravation”.The game asks players if Taiwan can stay safe by avoiding provocative action, or if it should “refrain from repeating the same mistakes of the last 30 years which allowed the communists to grow into the behemoth today”.In player descriptions, the game describes the communists as “heavy-handed, reckless and inept” and accused of “widespread corruption, embezzlement, exploitation, slaughter and defilement”.On their Facebook page, the developers – known as ESC Taiwan or Taiwan Overseas Strategic Communication Working Group (ESC) – said the attention had boosted downloads. On Wednesday it said the game had topped the Hong Kong App Store’s downloads chart on Tuesday night, before being taken down in the morning.“We encourage users to change the country or region of their Apple ID in order to successfully download the game.”The developers vowed not to actively filter or review any words or phrases in the game – a nod to recent controversies overcensorship in Chinese-made or China-related games.It is unclear where ESC Taiwan is based.The police warning over the game forms part of an ongoing crackdown on pro-democracy opposition in Hong Kong, where CCP control has steadily tightened around the once semi-autonomous city. In 2020 Beijing imposed thenational security law on Hong Kong, with the city government’s blessing, outlawing a broad range of dissenting behaviours as criminal.Critics have accused authorities of weaponising the law to target opposition voices, including activists, politicians, labour unions, journalists and media outlets, as well as children’s books and bookshops.Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsHong KongMobile gamesAsia PacificTibetGamesUyghursChinanewsShareReuse this content"

Girls were more likely to report reading for wellbeing and emotional support than boys, while boys and girls reported reading for curiosity purposes at similar levels.Just one in three (32.7%) eight- to 18-year-olds reported enjoying reading “very much” or “quite a lot” this year. The 20 years since the survey began have seen a 36% fall in the number of children and young people who say they enjoy reading in their spare time. Meanwhile, the number of eight- to 18-year-olds who report reading something daily in their free time has halved in the last two decades, from 38.1% to 18.7%.“This year’s data is once again stark,” said NLT CEO Jonathan Douglas. “We are witnessing the lowest levels of reading enjoyment and daily reading in a generation – a critical challenge for literacy, wellbeing and life chances. Children’s futures are being put at risk and joining forces across sectors to address the reading for pleasure crisis is essential”.It’s heartbreaking so few children read for pleasure – and sad to know the reasons why | Rhiannon Lucy CosslettRead moreHowever, the research “also offers hope”, he said. Of those who do not enjoy reading, 38.1% said that they were more motivated to read when the material relates to a favourite film or TV series, while 37.1% said they would be motivated by finding books that match their interests or hobbies.“This suggests linking reading text more explicitly to other media, particularly visual media, and emphasising how reading can help you to explore personal interests could support greater reading engagement in this group,” reads the report.“Young people are still motivated to read when it connects to their interests, when they have choice, and when it feels relevant to their lives. We must meet young readers where they are” in order to “reignite a love of reading”, Douglas added.Of those with the lowest reading enjoyment levels, 30.9% said they were motivated to read by seeing an interesting book cover or title.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

These results challenge “some long-held assumptions about how to build a culture of reading”, states the report. “While these strategies may benefit avid readers, they may do little for those on the margins of literacy engagement.”Differences in reading enjoyment between children based on socioeconomic background was “minimal”. Of eight- to 18-year-olds who do not receive free school meals, 33% reported enjoying reading in their free time, compared with 31% who do receive them.Geographical differences did emerge, with 33.2% of eight- to 18-year-olds in England reporting enjoying reading in their free time, compared with 25.5% in Wales, 30.3% in Scotland, and 28.9% in Northern Ireland.Explore more on these topicsBooksLiteracynewsShareReuse this content"

Her first words set the tone – “You want to fuck me,” she says – and lead us into an uncompromising introduction, littered with sex, violence and sideways jokes.She is the creation of French-English actor and writer Lily Sinko, and as her character’s name suggests, we’re hurled through a life of saintliness and sin, despair and redemption, as Magdalena does the best with the hand she’s dealt. We travel to her childhood in Marseille with a hostile “Papa”, an airport abduction that sees her deposited at the Virgin Mary School for Bad Bad Girls (Cash Only), and a wild escape through the streets of France, finding fleeting refuge in a cathedral.It’s a tour de force performance from Sinko. She rages, writhes, provokes and teases her way through Magdalena’s life story. Whether she’s in a high-kicking fight, scrabbling for a missing passport, or falling to her knees at a possible sign from a possible god, Sinko’s commitment is total, her presence enthralling.Often, the story itself feels secondary in comparison. The bare bones of Magdalena’s tale are horrifying – endless abuse and exploitation – but every detail is cartoonishly heightened (an eyeball dislodged by a stiletto, stealing camembert from the mouth of a stranger). It plays out as a surreal farce, filtered through our oversexualised storyteller. Tonally, that’s challenging at times, leaving us in limbo between laughs and deeper investment in the narrative. We skim the surface of bigger ideas. Parallels are drawn between Magdalena’s treatment in her father’s house, at the brothel and within the church. Questions are asked about who is worthy of redemption.But while Magdalena might not inspire profound revelations, Sinko ensures there is never a dull moment.AtPlayhouse East, London, until 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

High Rollers is a heart-slowing work of staggering stupidity and charmlessness, ineptly made and quite frankly dull except when its flaws become so egregious you can’t help but guffaw.The idea is that Mason Goddard (John Travolta, who has finally given up on hairpieces and embraced the bald) leads a rodent pack of skilled thieves and conmen. The gang is first met at the beach wedding of two of the group’s younger members, tech whiz Link (Natali Yura, mouth permanently agape) and dim hunk Caras (Swen Temmel). Alas, the nuptials are interrupted when international criminal Salazar (Danny Pardo) and his henchmen swoop in and kidnap Mason’s wife Amelia (Gina Gershon, somehow surviving this with dignity intact). Salazar demands that Mason and his crew, which also includes his gormless safecracking brother Shawn (Lukas Haas) and sidekicks Anton (mononymed Quavo) and Hector (Noel Gugliemi), must steal the contents of a safe in the suite of casino owner Zade Black (Demián Castro) at his supposedly classy New Orleans casino the Scarlet Pearl.Even the name of this fictional gaming facility sounds trashy, and when we see its interior – all lurid carpeting and easily wipeable soft furnishings – it looks less like Monte Carlo’s finest than the kind of seedy regional gambling den that the producers could hire cheaply. The air of tawdry cost-cutting pervades every level of the film, from the casting to the costumes to the paste jewellery that’s supposed to stand in for posh gemstones. There are tons of holes in the plot, but those are too tedious to parse; just study the frame closely and you can have a laugh at the truly hideous pictures on the walls that someone on the team thought would pass for fancy art.High Rollers is on digital platforms from 16 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersJohn TravoltareviewsShareReuse this content"

But this funny and smart French comedy instead gives us a 21st-century Jane Austen. British-French actor Camille Rutherford is terrific as Agathe, an aspiring novelist working in a Paris bookshop who wins a place on a Jane Austen writing retreat run by the author’s descendants.“I’m not living in the right century!” Agathe wails to her best friend and colleague Félix (Pablo Pauly). She’s not into dating apps (“I don’t want Uber sex!”). But she does have chemistry with Félix (he’s a player, but not at Wickham levels of caddishness), and it’s Félix who secretly submits Agathe’s writing to a Jane Austen society. The comedy takes a bit of an IQ dip when the film crosses the Channel and the dialogue switches to English. Still, it glides along on Rutherford’s performance as Agathe – witty, warm, keenly observant, a bit clumsy and Bridget Jones-ish, but never, not even for a moment, cringy.On the retreat, Agathe takes an instant loathing to Austen’s great-great-great-nephew Oliver (Charlie Anson); he’s a professor of modern literature who loftily proclaims that Austen is overrated. Judgmental, arrogant, and altogether up himself, Oliver is the film’s Mr Darcy – though played with too much Hugh Grant to take seriously. You don’t have to be an Austen fan to enjoy this film, but it helps. Agathe’s dilemma between Oliver and Félix is classic Austen – but Agathe’s real discovery is not love, but her writing voice. And that’s the point the film makes without trying too hard: new century, same self-pressure and doubt. Here’s Agathe on impostor syndrome. “No – I’m a genuine impostor!”Jane Austen Wrecked My Life is in UK cinemas from 13 June and Australian cinemas from 19 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsRomance filmsJane AustenComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Her new life is disturbed when she finds her ex-partner Tom has moved in down the road. Or rather, that’s one thread in a story that becomes steadily more interesting than this simple set-up from the romance novelist’s playbook, as layers of family memory and trauma build up to form a portrait of the wider O’Connor family: all their history, the way it has shaped them and the traces it has left on the places around.Claire shows herself to be unusually attuned to the history of her home place, telling stories about nearby Thoor Ballylee, where Yeats lived; Lady Gregory’s Coole Park; the place where Cromwell used to stable his horses. At first it seems a bit forced, a writer shoehorning in their research. But the tic begins to make sense as the marks of the past on Claire’s family are revealed; slowly, one realises that the enumeration of these histories is crucial to the way the O’Connors live. Central to this gradual discovery is Feeney’s use of stories-within-the-story; the novel is enlivened by a series of smaller, contained memories from Claire’s childhood, and tales reaching back a century to the time when the O’Connors first lived in the family home.The family believe they can never pull their old house down – but this cavern of memory only offers access to past painThese are fascinating interludes breaking up the main plot, which is the slow and not very complex thawing of Claire’s relationship with Tom, a recovery that seems to allow her to complete her cycle of grieving for her parents. In these shorter stories, which are like currants in the cake, we get access to the depths of her family’s life: heartbreaking glimpses of her father’s attempt to sell a horse to the queen of England’s breeders, and of the appalling violence visited on the family by the Black and Tans. These are the kinds of memories that can go on to define whole lives, and illuminate the more humdrum present Claire is living in.It slowly emerges that really, this novel tells the story of a house. Feeney has created a brilliant metaphor in the O’Connor family home, a modern bungalow with the old farmhouse looming behind it. Like the fairy tree at the bottom of the farm, the family have come to believe they can never pull the old house down, lest it bring them bad luck; but this looming cavern of memory seems to offer very little access to past happiness, only past pain. By the end of Let Me Go Mad in My Own Way, the novel has become a story about what a family should do with its past. It’s a hugely satisfying, sophisticated structure, and the apparent thinness of Claire and Tom’s story ceases to matter, because it’s only the first layer of a more complex work.Aspects of the novel are less successful. Claire finds herself drawn into the world oftradwives, and begins taking lifestyle tips from an Instagram account run by one of these women. This dalliance with what are essentially hard-right politics isn’t particularly well ironised, and Claire seems to simply snap out of it. She realises there is no lost perfect time, only different hardship; but the discovery isn’t given enough room to make sense, so all the pages of baking end up seeming like a fever dream that’s never quite explained. Feeney is also capable of writing very, very unsuccessful dialogue: “You’re not dragging me into your murky confusion, Claire.” “I forget sometimes.” “Forget what?” “All the people I’ve met – since.” “Since?” ‘Us.” This can make the characters sound a bit thick, which they manifestly aren’t. However, the novel’s baggy, complex, unfolding structure offers rich rewards.Let Me Go Mad in My Own Way by Elaine Feeney is published by Harvill Secker (£16.99).

Real pride has gone into crafting this set of shocks, and it’s very well acted in beautiful locationsCatherine BrayWed 11 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 11 Jun 2025 04.01 EDTShareThis is the way the world ends, not with a bang but a wimple. In this well-crafted horror movie, a young woman called Grace (Jena Malone) finds herself up against a bunch of nuns who may or may not be trying to do something extremely dodgy with an unknown relic, and as with last year’s Omen prequel, there’s a nice line in casting here from the Ladybird Book of Horror Nuns. There’s dotty young nun who pops up going “peekaboo” (Eilidh Fisher), an arrogant mother superior (Janet Suzman), a hardliner weapon-of-Christ sort (Jolade Obasola), and the rather rarer spooky nun with one eye hidden behind an ominous white bandage (Alexandra Lewis). Their acting is uniformly excellent, as is that fromDanny Huston, who plays a priest who introduces himself thusly: “I’m Father Romero, I’m here from the Vatican,” which announces him as probably up to no good from the get-go.Grace arrives to identify the body of her brother (Steffan Cennydd), seemingly involved in a murder-suicide, has reasons of her own for being less than a fully paid-up God squad member, and while the reasons may not be much of a surprise if you’ve seen a few of these kinds of films, this is a very nicely put together example. Sure, it’s purest hokum, but real pride has gone into crafting it..Cocooning the treats of the storytelling in natural splendour, Consecration boasts some gorgeous location work; filmed on Skye and other scenic areas, there are rolling highlands, vertiginous cliff-tops, a tumbledown abbey on the crest of a hill – which you just have to accept as the site of the Knights of the Morning Star, an ancient dark force in the church. The world of the film feels real, a splendid argument for less green screen, more green fields – kudos to veteran British horror helmer Christopher Smith (Severance).Consecration is on digital platforms from 16 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsDanny HustonreviewsShareReuse this content"

For 34 days, they took turns sitting on it. When the egg hatched, the story became a viral sensation. The New York Times celebrated “A Love That Dare Not Squeak Its Name”. Roy, Silo and their daughter Tango became the subject of a LGBTQ-friendly children’s book, And Tango Makes Threeby Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell.Biology professor Nathan Lents remembers receiving copies of Tangoas a gift when he and his husband became foster parents. Fast-forward to the present day, and Tango tops Pen America’s list of the most frequently banned picture books in the US. It was part of a high-profile lawsuit in Nassau County, Florida, and was designated for pulping by officials in Singapore. In 2025, it’s apparent that “conventional categories for gender identity and expression, and sexual attraction and romanticism, are just not cutting it any more”, Lents writes. Queer, non-binary, transgender, polyamorous – terms that were perhaps once obscure are here to stay. But at the same time, a powerful backlash is under way.This bookisn’t a directly political text, but its colourful tales from the animal world do have a point of view: biology, Lents argues here, comes down strongly against rigid categories. The story of sexual evolutionis one of experimentation and constant improvisation, and that, he says, goes a long way to explaining why human sexual norms seem to be undergoing a transformation: “I assert that this moment of sexual turmoil is actually a rediscovery of the much more expansive relationship with sex that our ancestors once had and that other animals enjoy,” he writes.Humans have an unhelpful tendency to project their own biases on to their observationsWhat follows is an entertaining and informative romp through mating strategies in nature. From Komodo dragons’ virgin births to the bilateral sperm transfer of hermaphroditic slugs, The Sexual Evolution chronicles a “wondrous variety” of behaviour in the animal world. Garter snake orgies, gender-masking hyenas, lusty bonobos and the lesbian Laysan albatrosses of Hawaii – this book has it all.All that diversity is fascinating, and frequently funny. Take the family structures of clown fish like the ones in Pixar’s 2003 hit Finding Nemo. The film tells the touching story of a dad fish’s quest to be reunited with his son after the mum is eaten,but “if the movie were biologically accurate, the story would have proceeded a little differently”, says Lents. “Upon the loss of his mate, Marlin would have transitioned to female. By the time Marlin reunited with Nemo, she would have been his mother.” And then? Once Marlin and Nemo established a new home, they would have begun to breed – together.While same-sex penguin unions might be sweet, clearly things tend to work a little bit differently in the non-human world than they do in our own. Animals can’t tell us why they mate or pair or behave the way they do. And humans have an unhelpful tendency to project their own biases on to their observations – something that is evident in the long history of sexism in biological sciences. “As the mostly male scientists through the last two centuries looked around at the animal world, they were all too eager to find validation for male dominance in human society,” Lents notes. For this reason, The Sexual Evolution is careful to avoid making simplistic comparisons, especially when it comes to the sex lives of other primates, such as chimps and bonobos.Unfortunately, the book’s final chapters, which turn to our own relationships, are its least compelling. Can we really draw any conclusions about human sexuality from our piecemeal knowledge of sexual norms in hunter-gatherer societies? Or from the swinging seductions of highly successful Soviet spies? Not all stories make useful parables. The Sexual Evolution is at its strongest when it’s simply revelling in kaleidoscopic tales of how other species do it. As Lents points out: “The natural world is a constantly churning diversity-generating machine, and the natural history of sex reflects that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Today, Somerset is still somewhere where seasons are felt vividly, as Sophie Brendel and Panu Long discovered when they and their two children moved to Thornfalcon, their farmstead in a village of the same name, 15 minutes’ drive from Taunton, at the end of 2022. Here, they are on constant weather watch, tending their young vines (Panu, now a winemaker, has a background in the drinks industry) and harvesting daily from the kitchen garden. They are also busy making plans for the apple harvest, which will go into the 150-year-old cider press.Somerset mapIn addition, they have created a handful of places to stay on their 16-hectare (40-acre) site, which sprawls through woods, orchards and vines to a reed-fringed lake. Walking around it at the end of May, you feel the cusp of summer, from the water lilies coming into bloom and the nesting swan, guarded by her mate. “Soon the eggs will hatch, and later she’ll teach the cygnets to fly, before taking them down to the Somerset Levels,” says Sophie.The Coach House is filled with antiques and beautiful textiles, which hint at Sophie’s years as a director at the V&AMy cabin, the Vine Hut, is surrounded by wildflowers overlooking rows of champagne grape varieties. Inside, nature is just as enveloping: nasturtiums climb over the bedroom wallpaper, a blousy bunch of homegrown peonies sits on the dining table. Behind the orchard, the Lambing Shed’s interior is clad in textured band-sawn planks and the bed’s headboard is painted with apple blossom. In front of the family’s blue lias stone farmhouse is the two-bedroom Coach House, filled with antiques and beautiful textiles, which hint at Sophie’s years spent among pattern and design as a director at the V&A. The latest arrival is a vardo Gypsy wagon with floral patterned ceiling, which sleeps two children as extra accommodation for families staying in the cabins.As the sun creeps out, I wander back to the lake, Mr Swan still patrolling in case I had a mind for a dip. Instead I sit in the wooden sauna – the big picture window frames the scene as swifts dip, and the mental ticker tape of to-do lists begins to melt away. There’s a hot tub outside too, and nearby an old boat house has been turned into the wild treatment room, where local therapist Gemma undoes some of the rest of my knots as the bird calls carry in off the water. Both cabins have outdoor baths of their own, although the plum spot at the Vine Hut after dinner is a pair of adirondack chairs, positioned just so to catch the sunset.View image in fullscreenThe Quantocks, seen from Cothelstone Hill in Somerset.Photograph: James Osmond/AlamyThe next morning, in the sunny, green-painted kitchen, I make breakfast with blue-shelled eggs from the brood of Legbar chickens. There’s the option to have a box of just-picked Thornfalcon produce in your cabin on arrival, or Sophie and Panu are full of recommendations for eating nearby, from roasts at theDinnington Docksto something smarter at theBarrington Boar. Afterwards, I take the short stomp through the village and up Thorn Hill (known as “the clump” for its wooden top), where baby bunnies dart from hedgerows. A patchwork of green rolls away to the edge of the Quantock Hills. There are other walks from the door, looping round through the village of North Curry – where you can pick up a duck sausage roll at theBird in Handpub, which is in the process of reopening and is currently serving pints and street food from a converted wagon outside. Slightly farther away, you can strike out around Cothelstone Hill to spot the herd of Exmoor ponies and bronze age burial mounds, or rent paddle boards from theSomerset Boat Centreto float along the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal.View image in fullscreenOwners Sophie and Panu with their Gypsy caravanA current of creativity also flows through this corner of Somerset, and later that morning I meet Buc Dennis at his family’sDennis Chinaworksin an old stable block outside Shepton Beauchamp (open Monday to Friday, and weekends by appointment). Visitors can buy beautiful vases and jugs, with patterns hand drawn by Buc’s mother, Sally Tuffin, a former fashion designer now in her 80s.It’s not the only creative family hub in these parts, and afterwards I swing by the Temperleys’Burrow Hill Cider Farm. The familiar Glastonbury cider bus is parked outside, the pumps fired up on Saturday afternoons, when local families spread picnic blankets between the apple trees, entertained by food trucks and circus troupes. Across the yard, Mary Temperley’sMake storeis stocked with zesty body washes (also in bathrooms at Thornfalcon), baskets woven in Ghana and suzanis stitched in Jaipur.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This summer, the first bottles of wine and cider will be ready; there are plans to take beekeeping courses and plant lavender fields; and to host feasts, yoga classes and painting workshops in a lovely old barn. It’s inspiring to be around, and equally, easy to dip into as much or as little as you choose.

Every Saturday, I make a simple rye bread dough, and gather whatever grains, nuts and seeds need using up – from forgotten millet to that last handful of brazil nuts – and soak them overnight. By Sunday lunchtime, the house will be filled with the homely aroma of fresh bread emerging from the oven.The life-changing loafWhen my daughter won’t eat anything but a slice of toast, I want to know she’s still being nourished, so I’ve raised our nutrient baseline by reformulating the recipes for our everyday staples – that is, bread, pasta, porridge and even cakes – with whole grains, omega-rich seeds and nutrient-dense ingredients such asmoringa powder. Of course, every family has its own tastes and comfort foods, so these changes need to be gradual. What matters most is that our children eat a diverse range of fruit and vegetables, but whole grains are also a big win.Today’s dense, sustaining loaf is almost a meal in itself. If your family is more used to white bread, begin by including a little wholewheat flour in your usual dough, then experiment – add a touch of buckwheat flour, say (just 5-10% of the total flour weight), or ancient grains such as khorasan or emmer. Soaked grains and seeds are another easy upgrade, and boost the nutritional value of any loaf, while a few raisins or chopped dried fruit can help improve the bread’s appeal, especially to children.The diversity in this loaf isn’t just good for our bodies, it’s vital for the planet, too. By incorporating a wider range of grains and seeds into our diets, we help support agricultural diversity beyond the traditional big four – wheat, corn, rice and soy – which currently provide 60% of the world’s plant-based calories. These industrial monocrops rely heavily on synthetic inputs and intensive farming, while many traditional and alternative grains thrive with fewer interventions. Each time we choose buckwheat, millet or rye, we cast a small but meaningful vote for a more resilient food system.When blending flours, keep at least 50% of the mix as dark rye or glutenous flour such as wholewheat or emmer. Avoid using too much buckwheat – 100-200g is plenty – because it can turn gummy. That said, this recipe also works beautifully with 100% dark rye or wholewheat flour. I don’t add salt or molasses to the mix, because our young baby eats this bread, too, so we try to keep sodium and sugar low. That said, adding either or both will enhance the loaf’s flavour.Traditionally, this kind of loaf would be baked in a Pullman-style tin with a lid – I use a large tin, about 33cm x 10cm. If you have a thermometer or probe, bake until the centre reaches 96C, though it’s also a forgiving bread if you don’t. The key is to let the loaf set fully, so leave to cool for at least five hours before slicing, and ideally wait until the next day to do so. I usually slice it thinly and store in an airtight container – it keeps well in or out of the fridge; it freezes beautifully, too.Makes1 loafFor the seed mix350g whole grains– buckwheat, pearl barley, brown rice, quinoa, oat groats, rye berries, etc350g mixed seeds, dried fruit and nuts– sunflower seeds, linseed, pumpkin seeds, raisins, dried apricots, goji berries, brazil nuts, walnuts, hazelnuts, etc2 tsp caraway seeds(optional)1 tbsp sea salt(optional)50ml molasses or honey(optional)For the dough550g dark rye flour, or a mixture of flours if you have bag ends that need using (wholewheat bread flour, buckwheat, emmer, etc), plus extra for dusting1½ tsp instant dried yeastOil, for greasingThe night before baking, in a large bowl mix the whole grains, the mixed seeds, dried fruit and nuts and 650g cold water. Add any or all of the optional ingredients, stir well, then cover and leave to soak at room temperature overnight.In a second large bowl, mix the flour, yeast and 350g cold water to form a stiff dough, then cover and leave to sit alongside the soaking grain mix.The next day, grease one large or two small loaf tins with a little oil, then line with baking paper or dust with flour. Tip the soaked grain mix into the dough, mix thoroughly until well combined, then scrape into the tin(s). Smooth out the top, dredge with flour, cover and leave to prove at room temperature for one to four hours, until the dough is well risen and the flour topping has cracked.Bake at 250C (230C fan)/490F/gas 9½ for 30 minutes, then turn down the heat to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 and bake for another 30 to 40 minutes, until dark brown on top. Turn out on to a wire rack and leave to cool completely for at least five hours before slicing, ideally the next day.Explore more on these topicsNuts and seedsWaste notBreadFoodFood wasteBakingFruitCereals and grainsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While the idea went against every fish-cooking mantra we knew, a large, fatty fish actually stands up rather well to a fairly long boil, and the process firms it up nicely, so you can pick up chunks of fish while leaving the bones (essential to give body and flavour to the broth) in the bowl. Our all-time favourite version of this dish was at the now defunct Jeju Hang restaurant in Seoul, where they served it with plump, broth-imbued half-moons of Korean radish and a condiment of fermented cutlass fish innards, as well as perfectly steamed rice. The salad, meanwhile, is a seasonal take on one of Jeju Hang’s side dishes (the original used seaweed instead of asparagus), and its mild, nutty, herbaceous flavour is the perfect foil to the sweet, spicy fish.Hard-boiled fish with Korean radish (pictured top)Source your mackerel carefully, because many UK fisheries are now so overfished as to be unconscionable – the ones we use are line-caught in the southwest, which is one of the UK’s few remaining sustainable mackerel fisheries; otherwise, use big fat herrings instead. Most large supermarkets sell gochujang (Korean fermented chilli paste) nowadays, while doenjang (Korean soybean paste) and gochugaru (Korean chilli powder) can both be found in any Asian supermarket (the doenjang can, at a pinch, be replaced with miso). As for the kelp, while it’s edible and very tasty, its main purpose is to impart umami to the broth and fish. Steamed rice is a non-negotiable alongside.Prep20 minCook30 minServes4For the seasoning sauce120g soy sauce120g mirin40g peeled garlic(about six or seven cloves), roughly chopped10g ginger, peeled and roughly chopped15g doenjang15g gochujang30g fish sauce15g gochugaruFor the fish1 mooli, peeled and cut into 2cm-thick rounds (about 500g)2 small onions, peeled and thinly sliced (about 250g)2 large sustainably-sourced mackerel, or herring, heads and guts removed, then cut across the bone into large chunks (800g-1kg net weight)10g kelp(kombu), or about ½ standard sheetA few finely sliced spring onions, to serveSteamed rice, to serveFirst make the seasoning sauce. Put all the ingredients in a food processor and blitz smooth.Lay the mooli rounds in a single layer in a wide, shallow saucepan, then layer the sliced onion, fish and seaweed on top. Pour the seasoning sauce over the whole lot, then add enough water just to cover the fish. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat so the broth is at a lively simmer, and cook for 20-25 minutes, regularly basting the fish, until the fish is cooked through, the mooli is tender and the sauce is reduced.Ladle into bowls, garnish with a handful of sliced spring onions and serve with steamed rice.Asparagus salad with mashed tofu and pine nut dressingView image in fullscreenKyu Jeong Jeon and Duncan Robertson’s asparagus salad with mashed tofu and pine nut dressing.Prep10 minPress15-30 minCook20 minServes4½ small block firm tofu(about 140g)50gpine nuts(about 3 tbsp), plus extra for serving1 garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped1tsp readymade English mustard1tbsp rice vinegar1 tsp honey2 red dates, pitted and roughly chopped (optional but recommended)2-3 tbspdashibroth, or waterSalt andblack pepper2 bunches asparagus(English, ideally), woody stems removed (about 500g net)Wrap the tofu in kitchen paper or muslin, put a heavy object on top (a can of beans will do) and leave for 15-30 minutes, to press out some of the moisture– the tofu needs to be very dry for this dish.Toast the pine nuts in a dry frying pan, tossing them continuously, for three or four minutes, until nicely golden brown all over and the kitchen is filled with the intoxicating aroma of freshly roasted nuts. Tip the nuts into a mortar or food processor, then grind to a powder. Roughly chop or crumble the tofu, add it to the mortar or processor, then mash until smooth.Add the garlic, mustard, vinegar, honey and red dates, if using, then pound or process again until smooth. Add just enough dashi (or water) to loosen the mix to a thick, creamy dressing, then season with salt and pepper to taste.Cook the asparagus in a pan of salted boiling water for about three minutes, so the spears are cooked but still have some bite to them, then drain and refresh under cold water. Drain again and dry on a clean tea towel or kitchen paper.Arrange the asparagus on a platter, spoon over the tofu dressing, and serve sprinkled with a few extra toasted pine nuts, if you like.Kyu Jeong Jeon and Duncan Robertson are chefs/co-owners ofBokmanandDongnae, both in BristolExplore more on these topicsFoodKorean food and drinkMain courseFishSeafoodRiceSaladrecipesShareReuse this content"
