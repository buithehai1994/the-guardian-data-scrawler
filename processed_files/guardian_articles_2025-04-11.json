The company’s owner, Jingye, has said it is losing about £700,000 a day.The issue of nationalisation will be dealt with separately and is not certain to happen, but senior sources said it was the likely outcome and the government would look at potential private sector partners for a transfer of ownership and co-investment.The company declined to comment and it remains unclear how Jingye will respond to being directed by the UK government.Government sources said generous offers had been made to the Chinese company that any rational actor would have accepted, and that the UK was taking action to keep the furnaces going in order to continue talks about the next steps. Once they had been allowed to stop, the furnaces would be impossible to restart.Speaking on Friday, Starmer said the “future of British steel hangs in the balance” and he would not stand by while the last blast furnaces in the UK were closed, shutting an essential industry.The GMB union said the move looked like “the first step in the process” of nationalisation, saying it was the only way to save the UK steel industry.“The business secretary must be given huge praise for acting decisively to safeguard this vital industry and the thousands of jobs that rely on it,” the union said.A No 10 spokesperson said: “The prime minister has been clear, his government will always act in the national interest. All actions we take are in the name of British industry, British jobs and for British workers.“Tomorrow, parliament will be recalled to debate the steel industry (special measures) bill. The bill provides the government with the power to direct steel companies in England, which we will use to protect the Scunthorpe site. It enables the UK government to preserve capability and ensure public safety. It also ensures all options remain viable for the future of the plant and the livelihoods it supports.“We have been negotiating with British Steel’s owners in good faith ever since coming to office. We have always been clear there is a bright future for steel in the UK. All options remain on the table.”The Commons will sit at 11am, with MPs called back from Easter recess to discuss putting the assets under public control. The government will aim to get emergency legislation through the Commons and Lords in one day of sitting.Labour MPs have been told to tell their whips where they are and to make all efforts to return to Westminster to ensure the passage of the legislation.The Guardian view on steel on the brink: Britain’s last blast furnaces face extinction | EditorialRead moreThis week government sources said nationalising British Steel was not easy, and would be a measure of last resort.The last time parliament was recalled during recess was in 2021, whenAfghanistan had to be evacuatedduring the Taliban takeover. It is also the first recall of parliament on a Saturday since 1982.One MP said the move was “going down extremely badly” with colleagues who had been given no warning about the need to return to Westminster, when it had been known for weeks that British Steel was in trouble.Some opposition parties were also furious that other industrial plants in trouble had not been given the same treatment from the government. Plaid Cymru said “the people of Wales would not forget” that the steel plant at Port Talbot was allowed to close its blast furnaces and convert to electric arc production, while the SNP highlighted the different treatment for Grangemouth – Scotland’s only oil refinery, which could close. Government sources said those plants were facing different situations.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said the government had “bungled” the negotiations with British Steel.“They must have seen this coming for a while,” she said. “Instead of addressing it earlier in the week when parliament was sitting, their incompetence has led to a last-minute recall of parliament.”British Steel makes the vast majority of UK rail track and the government has been seeking a deal to keep the plant open.The industry will be hit by a25% tariff on steel exportsto the US imposed by Donald Trump but the government has insisted British Steel’s problems are not related to this.Talks with Jingye’s chair, Li Ganpo, had dragged on for three days after the government offered to buy raw materials to keep the plant running for the next few weeks while trying to find a longer-term solution.Scunthorpe is the last remaining steelworks capable of making steel from iron ore and so is seen by some people as strategically important for the UK. However, Jingye last month said itplanned to close the plant’s two blast furnaces, putting 2,700 jobs at risk. It has since refused to pay for new raw materials, with coal and iron ore deliveries to Immingham port not yet paid for.The government had offered £500m in financial support to switch the blast furnaces to cleaner electric arc furnaces, but Jingye had requested much more.Talks this week are thought to have stalled when Jingye balked at the conditions attached to the offer to pay for new raw materials. The delays in reaching an agreement had caused increasing alarm among workers, who feared at least one blast furnace might be forced to close as soon as next week, leading to job losses.Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelHouse of CommonsSteel industrynewsShareReuse this content"

US government bonds – typically seen as one of the world’s safest financial assets – continued to be sold off, and were on course for their biggest weekly loss since 2019. The dollar also fell against a basket of currencies, and was down against the euro and the pound.Leading stock indices paused for breath on Friday after days of torrid trading. The FTSE 100 rose 0.6% in London. The S&P 500 increased 1.8% and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.6% in New York.The S&P 500 finished an extraordinarily volatile week for markets up 5.7%, its biggest weekly gain since November 2023.“We are doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly. DJT”Some of Wall Street’s most influential figures were unconvinced. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Larry Fink, CEO of the investment giant BlackRock, told CNBC. Far from providing certainty, the 90-day pause on higher US tariffs on much of the world “means longer, more elevated uncertainty”, he added.Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the US’s largest bank, said the world’s largest economy was facing “considerable turbulence” as a key measure of consumer confidence tumbled to its lowest level since the Covid-19 pandemic – and the second-lowest level on record.US consumer sentiment has dropped 11% to 50.8 this month, ahead the pause announced by Trump earlier this week, according to a regularly survey compiled by the University of Michigan.Expectations for inflation meanwhile surged, with respondents indicating they are bracing for prices to rise by 6.7% over the coming year – the survey’s highest year-ahead inflation expectation reading since 1981.“There is great optimism in this economy,” Leavitt claimed at the White House briefing when asked about the survey. “Trust in President Trump. He knows what he’s doing. This is a proven economic formula.”Trump won back the White House last November by pledging to rapidly bring down prices – something he has claimed, in recent weeks, is already happening. US inflation climbed at an annual rate of 2.4% last month, according to official data.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added, however, that a bipartisan divide – with Democrats growing more pessimistic, while Republicans become more upbeat – suggests that people are allowing their political views to cloud their economic confidence.The US’s top markets watchdog is facing demands from senior Democrats to launch an investigation intoalleged insider trading and market manipulationafter Trump declared on social media that it was “A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!” hours before announcingWednesday’s climbdown on tariffs.Days of erratic policymaking constructed a rollercoaster week for markets, with the S&P 500 dropping 12% in just four sessions, before surging back almost 10% in a single day after the administration pulled back from imposing higher tariffs on most countries, exceptChina, which is facing a 145% tariff on exports to the US.In a letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),Senate Democratsincluding Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer wrote: “It is unconscionable that as American families are concerned about their financial security during this economic crisis entirely manufactured by the President, insiders may have actively profited from the market volatility and potentially perpetrated financial fraud on the American public.”‘The damage is done’: Trump’s tariffs put the dollar’s safe haven status in jeopardyRead moreTesla meanwhilestopped taking orders in Chinafor two models it previously imported from the US, as companies scramble to adapt to prohibitive tariffs imposed in Trump’s trade war.The manufacturer, run by Trump’s close allyElon Musk, removed “order now” buttons on its Chinese website for its Model S saloon and Model X sports utility vehicle.Tesla did not give any indication of why it had made the changes but it came after the rapid escalation of the trade war between the US and China.The border taxes make the goods trade between the two countries prohibitively expensive and mean cars imported from the US are now much less attractive inChinathan those produced locally.In the UK, economists warned that stronger than expected growth of 0.5% in February is likely to prove short lived as the impact of Trump’s trade war is felt throughout the global economy.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpChinaAsia PacificTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This was a wholly unevidenced and inherently implausible case.”At Friday’s conclusion of the trial, which began on 7 March, Millar said that allegations made by Clarke about the motives of the Guardian’s witnesses and its journalists had been shown to be a “complete nonsense”.The conspiracy theory, he said, was “a case born of necessary invention”. Millar said Clarke had “a very clear motive to lie”.For Clarke, Philip Williams said that his client was the victim of an industry attempting to correct itself after the #MeToo movement. He highlighted the Benny Hill and Little Britain series and Carry On films as productions that would now be considered “inappropriate”.He said, in written submissions: “Mr Clarke, with his success despite his outsider status and as a clear product of that time, was simply a casualty of this purge. It represents illiterate historical revisionism and completely ignores any nuance or context.”He told the court: “The court will realise that the Guardian has manifestly failed to do its job properly. They approached the destruction of this man’s life with a cavalier, haphazard and negligent attitude which can only be described as competitive ignorance.”The WitnessesDuring the course of the trial, the Guardian argued two defences: that the allegations in the articles were true and that they were also in the public interest.The court heard from 28 “truth” witnesses who had been prepared to sign statements for the Guardian, included 21 “key witnesses” who said they had experienced misconduct by Clarke themselves or directly witnessed it.Millar said that their evidence supported the claims against Clarke, which were made up of several elements.They were that:Over 15 years, he used his power to prey on and harass female colleagues.He sometimes bullied female colleagues.He engaged in unwanted sexual contact, kissing, touching or groping.He engaged in sexually inappropriate behaviour and comments.He was involved in professional misconduct.He took and shared explicit pictures and videos without consent, including secretly filming a young actor’s naked audition.“The truth witnesses who gave evidence for [the Guardian] have all come up to proof. They have no reason at all to lie and every reason not to,” Millar said.In oral submissions, he told the court that Clarke’s position was that “every one of them is lying about something or, when he can’t remember, then they must be lying because he wouldn’t have said or done what they allege. It’s an extraordinary position to take … That high number [of witnesses] is against him. It’s inherently improbable.”Millar said that that witnesses were variously corroborated by other people and documentary evidence. For example, Jing Lusi messaged a friend a day or too after dinner with Clarke saying she had been “Me-Too-ed” at work, while Imogen*, who, as a “wide-eyed” 20-year-old, said she was propositioned over dinner by Clarke and found him “sexually threatening” wrote a contemporary, unpublished Tumblr post about her experience.Williams said in written submissions that the Guardian had sought to rely on a handful of people who “were plotting and carrying out their scheme from 2019 to bring about Mr Clarke’s downfall, based on vitriolic hatred, professional jealousy, classist snobbery and insidious racialised bias”.He told the court: “The alleged complainants, and the others involved in the campaign, were not acting independently.” As such, he said the court was “not confronted with 20-plus individual complainants, but an interlinked network”.The court heard that five of Clarke’s witnesses did not turn up and Millar said that excepting one, Clarke “could not produce a single witness to support or corroborate his version of events on the key factual issues”.He described Clarke’s witnesses as, bar his wife, “male friends of his who apparently attended trial out of loyalty to him”.Williams said some of Clarke’s potential witnesses had been “frightened off”, claiming that the actor’s former assistant, Gina Powell, and one of his accusers, had sought to “discredit” several with “flawed allegations” made against them.Public interestSeveral Guardian journalists gave evidence during the trial to argue the publication of the articles was in the public interest.In his written submissions, Millar said: “They have no reason at all to lie and every reason not to. And the evidence has shown overwhelmingly that [the Guardian’s] assessment that publication of the articles in issue was in the public interest was not only reasonable, it was correct.”One of the Guardian’s reporters, Lucy Osborne, was described by Millar as “an obviously truthful witness who, as with her colleagues, had impressive command of the detail of the investigation notwithstanding the passage of time”.Sirin Kale, her reporting colleague, and Paul Lewis, the Guardian’s investigations editor, were described as “considered, thoughtful and concerned to assist the court in understanding the work they undertook”.“They were careful witnesses who were conscious at the time of the significance and potential consequences of publication.”Williams’s written submissions on behalf of Clarke contained diagrams of what were described as “primary connections” and “secondary connections” between the actor’s accusers – connections which he said the Guardian should have been aware of.He said the claims against Clarke were “a stitch-up” and that this should have been apparent to the Guardian.Williams said the public interest defence should fail because there was “a lack of verification for some of these major issues that they could not have believed that the allegations were fit for publication”.Millar told the court that the claimant had raised “granular points” in relation to the evidence considered by reporters to try to undermine them.He also dismissed suggestions there were racial undertones to the investigation, saying there was “unsurprisingly no evidence whatsoever” to support the claim.He described the diagram showing purported links between the accusers as “childish” and said that attempts to substantiate the alleged conspiracy as consisting of “speculative questioning and attempts to fish for a case by asking about connections between witnesses and supposed sources”.He told the court: “This was a careful, and thorough, investigation conducted conscientiously by Guardian journalists who were aware of the potential pitfalls.“They received information from a wide range of sources with direct evidence of misconduct and in each case carefully considered and tested the information they were given, electing to publish only such information as they believed was credible. In testing those accounts they did all that could be reasonably expected of them.“They published the allegations accurately and in the case of every published allegation also set out [Clarke’]s response to the allegation. Their belief that publication of the articles was in the public interest cannot be faulted. It was plainly a reasonable belief.”In his written submissions, Millar said the evidence of Viner, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, and her deputy, Owen Gibson, went unchallenged.“It must be accepted by [Clarke] that it was Ms Viner who took the decision that it was in the public interest to publish and she did so in good faith based on the factors she sets out in her evidence.”Clarke’s denialsClarke variously accused his accusers of lying, embellishing incidents and having axes to grind.Williams said: “Complainants were ‘carefully curated’, and encouraged to cooperate with one another in order to create and embellish their complaints.”But he also denied that incidents described by witnesses amounted to sexual misconduct.In contrast to the evidence given by witnesses, Williams described some of the incidents as nothing more than “tapping of a leg for practical purposes, bad taste jokes, unbefitting banter, consensual sex and photographs, and purported threats to silence”.He said: “Mr Clarke was classified as a ‘serial abuser’ – rhetorically, what is the abuse? … Out of this of sea of insinuations and innuendoes, trying to identify actual instances of sexual harassment (which attain the threshold of s.26 of the Equality Act) or sexual assault is akin to finding needles in a haystack.”Making a point about changing standards over time, Williams also said: “The lens of 20 years ago is not the lens of today.”But Millar said rather than admitting fault, Clarke had “made unpersuasive but revealing efforts to normalise and/or excuse conduct that most people would find – and would have found whether 10 or 20 years ago – offensive and unacceptable”.He said the evidence had “shown [Clarke] to be precisely the man depicted in … [the] articles, who has brought this case to trial on an entirely false basis”.Millar referred disparagingly to Clarke’s suggestion that one of his accusers had been motived to perjure herself because of her belief in “women’s rights”.He said Clarke “was an unreliable witness whose evidence on the factual issues should not be believed”.As an example, he cited Clarke’s response to allegations made by one woman that she experienced unwanted sexual touching by Clarke during the filming of a sex scene.Millar said that key aspects of Clarke’s evidence “were admitted by him to be false”, including that he had supported himself on his left leg throughout the scene when the film shows his hips right up against the woman’s.“All these misstatements contributed to a false narrative of the shooting of the scene,” Millar said.He told the high court that Clarke had produced “worthless evidence”.“The evidence which the court has heard shows overwhelmingly that [Clarke’s] case must fail,” Millar told the court. “[The Guardian’s] investigative journalism, and the witnesses who gave evidence of their knowledge of [Clarke’s] extensive misconduct, have been vindicated.”The judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, will give her judgment at a later date.*Not their real nameExplore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeGuardian Media GroupThe GuardiannewsShareReuse this content"

The medication is available for weight loss to some people on the NHS and it can also be bought privately with a prescription.Scientists at Eli Lilly, the company that makes Mounjaro, along with academic researchers have released two analyses of data from a three-year trial known as Surmount-1, throwing fresh light on the medication’s longer-term use. One analysis looked at trajectories of weight loss, the second at rebound after initial weight reduction.The results, which are to be presented at the European Congress onObesityin Málaga next month and have yet to be peer reviewed, are based on data from about 700 participants who took tirzepatide in three different dose regimens during the 176-week study. All had obesity or were overweight and had pre-diabetes.How does weight loss drug Mounjaro work and why is it in such high demand?Read moreThe results reveal participants’ experiences tended to follow one of three patterns – either steady, medium or rapid weight loss, followed by a plateau, which occurred later the faster the initial drop. The team said the final average body weight reductions for these groups were 9.2%, 20.2% and 30.8% respectively. Each group encompassed around a third of the participants.“[The work] demonstrates that we can in some way predict total final weight loss from the speed of weight loss observed in the first months of treatment,” said Prof Luca Busetto, of the University of Padova in Italy, one of the scientists behind the first analysis.The researchers said most of the participants maintained clinically meaningful weight reduction over the course of the study. This was supported by a second analysis that found that average time to the lowest weight reached was 22 months, at which point participants had lost 23.1% of their starting weight on average.While some subsequently regained weight – despite continuing with the medication – participants had nonetheless lost 19.4% of their starting weight, on average, by the end of the study.The team added that 70% of participants regained less than 5% of their starting weight after hitting their lowest point.Prof Naveed Sattar, of the University of Glasgow, who was not involved in the trial, said the finding of different weight loss trajectories could help give an indication of how much weight an individual might expect to lose in the long term. “That might be able to guide the need for some individuals to consider newer therapies, which are more potent, in the future,” he said.Dr Simon Cork, of Anglia Ruskin University, said the other analysis demonstrated the long-term effectiveness of tirzepatide in maintaining weight loss, which would be of interest to health bodies “as the costs of treating obesity-related co-morbidities rise year on year”.Cork also noted long-term effectiveness and safety studies for such drugs were now at odds with guidance, which limits their use to a maximum of two years.The findings come as the Advertising Standards Authority announced that along with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the General Pharmaceutical Council, it had warned businesses that advertising prescription-only medications to the public was prohibited. This includes weight loss jabs such as Mounjaro, Wegovy and Saxenda.Among other examples, the rules cover paid-for ads on social media “such as image or video ads on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok”, sponsored searches on Google or other search engines, and ads by influencers.A Guardian investigationpreviously revealedthat weight-loss injections were being aggressively marketed to British consumers through often illegal promotions.Explore more on these topicsObesityHealthMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

The changes could come into effect within three years,according to the Times.Currently, those flying must check in, which can be done online or at the airport upon arrival. They are then issued with a boarding pass with a barcode. This is scanned by a passenger at various points throughout the airport, including at the gate before boarding.The incredible shrinking airlines: can anyone actually be comfortable in a 17-inch seat?Read moreThe changes would make boarding passes and the need to check in for flights obsolete. Instead, flyers will download a “journey pass” to their phone when they book a flight. The pass will be automatically updated if any changes are made to the booking.Passengers will also be able to upload their passports to their phone and travel through airports using their face for verification. Instead of manually checking in, which would let airlines know who intends to board their flights, airlines will instead be alerted when passengers arrive at the airport and their face is scanned.Valérie Viale, the director of product management at Amadeus, a travel technology company, told the Times that the changes were “the biggest in 50 years”. She said: “The last upgrade of great scale was the adoption of e-ticketing in the early 2000s. The industry has now decided it’s time to upgrade to modern systems that are more like what Amazon would use.”Infrastructure upgrades at airports, including facial recognition technology and the ability to read a passport from a mobile device, would be needed for the plans to be carried out successfully.“Many airline systems haven’t changed for more than 50 years because everything has to be consistent across the industry and interoperable,” said Viale.The new technology could spark privacy concerns but Amadeus said it had developed a system where passengers’ details are wiped within 15 seconds of each contact with a “touchpoint” – such as the pre-security gates.How delays and connecting flights are handled could also change. Under the technology being developed, passengers who miss connecting flights due to delays out of their control could automatically be sent a notification on their phones with details of their new onward flight. Their journey pass would automatically update and they would be allowed to board the new flight.“At the moment airlines have systems that are very siloed,” Viale said. “There’s the reservation system that, when check-in opens, makes a handshake with a delivery system and says ‘here are my reservations, you can now deliver them’. In the future, it’ll be far more continuous and the journey pass will be dynamic.”Explore more on these topicsAir transportUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Surrey police tracked the devices to Brown’s mother’s house in Cobham, Surrey, and later accepted the devices belonged to her children and she was “entitled” to confiscate them.“I find it quite traumatic even talking about this now,” Brown said.“At no point did [the officers] think to themselves, ‘Oh, this is a little bit of an overreaction for a moment, confiscating temporarily her [own] iPads and popping over to her mum’s to have a coffee’. It was just a complete overreaction.”She added: “It was thoroughly unprofessional. They were speaking to my mother, who is in her 80s, like she was a criminal.”Surrey police said a search for the devices began after a man in his 40s reported the theft of two iPads to officers who attended an address in Cobham, following a report of a “concern for safety”.Parents arrested by Hertfordshire police for complaining about daughter’s schoolRead moreCh Supt Aimee Ramm, Surrey police’s northern divisional commander, said: “This led officers to carry out further enquiries at a second address, where a 50-year-old woman from Cobham was questioned about the iPads and denied any knowledge of their whereabouts.“However, a tracking device on the iPads showed that they were at the address. Officers encouraged the woman to return the items and resolve the matter, however the woman did not cooperate and therefore she was arrested on suspicion of theft. A search was then carried out using post-arrest powers and the iPads were located.“During this time, officers called South East Coast ambulance to attend the address following a further concern for safety.”Brown told LBC she was taken to Staines police station, where she was searched and had fingerprints and custody shots taken, before being placed in a cell.She said she was not able to return to her mother’s home until almost 12 hours after police first arrived, and was left in a “catatonic state” as a result of the experience.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All these police cars and police officers going into address over a completely false report of a theft.”Surrey police said Brown was released on conditional bail while further enquiries were carried out to establish the ownership of the iPads.Ramm said: “The police bail conditions included not speaking to anyone connected to the investigation, including her daughters, while officers carried out their enquiries.“Following these enquiries, officers were able to verify that the iPads belonged to the woman’s children, and that she was entitled to confiscate these items from her own children. The case was therefore closed the following day with no further action being taken and the bail conditions which had been set were then no longer applicable.“Officers did attend the daughter’s school – however this was in relation to the initial concern for safety.”Explore more on these topicsSurreyPoliceEnglandChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

She wrote: “This fucking dude. GROSS” and relayed the account in writing over a copy of a BBC article reporting that Celebrity Big Brother’s producers had reprimanded him for aiminghomophobic commentsat the singer JoJo Siwa while they competed on the reality show.A representative of Rourke did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thorne’s allegations.Thorne’s post recounted how she and the Oscar nominee were sharing a scene in which she was kneeling with her hands zip-tied around her back. “He’s supposed to take a metal grinder to my knee cap and instead he used it on my genitals [through] my jeans,” Thorne wrote. “Hitting them over and over again. I had bruises on my pelvic bone - Working with Mickey was one of the all time worst experiences of my life working as an actress.”She also shared a screenshot of a post on X in which she alleged that Rourke separately revved an engine and covered her “completely in dirt” for another scene.“I guess he thought it was funny to humiliate me in front of the entire crew,” Thorne – the 27-year-old former Disney star whose credits also include The Duff and Amityville: The Awakening – said of Rourke, 72.Thornethen asserted that she had to take it upon herself to “go in his trailer absolutely alone” and talk him into finishing up the movie “as he shouted crazy demands that he wanted” from those helming the project written and directed by Chad Faust.“He refused to speak to the director or producers – so I had to convince him to show up and complete his job,” Thorne continued. “In fact I had to beg.”She said it was “uncomfortable”. But she said she endured it because “the movie could not be finished without him [and] everyone’s work would’ve just been lost and completely for nothing”.Thorne’s comments about her on-set experience with Rourke on Girl capped off a week of unflattering headlines for the actor whose work on 2008’sThe Wrestleronce won him Golden Globe and Bafta awards.He earned a formal warning from Celebrity Big Brother UK’s producers after going on the show and boasting to Siwa, who is gay, that he would “make her straight”.Rourke also invoked a British slang word for cigarette that is also a homophobic slur in the US before directing himself at Siwa and saying: “I’m not talking to you.”Celebrity Big Brother UK’s producers indicated to Rourke that they would remove him from the show if he kept up with the homophobic language.Explore more on these topicsMickey RourkeThrillersnewsShareReuse this content"

But because the local Met officers became so well known to these gangs, the police had to come up with “creative plans” to “deliver vengeance”.Insp Darren Watson, who is responsible for local neighbourhood policing in Lambeth North West and is now “also known as Batman”, said: “We know that two repeat offenders have been operating on Westminster Bridge and have come to recognise me and my team from our patrols.“I knew that if we were going to catch them we would have to think outside the box, and then I remembered that I had Batman and Robin costumes to hand which could come in use.“Although dressing up may not be the most conventional policing method, we were thrilled to see that in this case it worked perfectly and the team were able to get some great results, taking these people off the street and protecting tourists and Londoners from being fleeced.”Eugen Stocia, 32, of no fixed address and Constica-Gherorghe Barbu, 53, of Herbert Road, Greenwich were arrested on 15 February for providing the facilities to gamble.Barbu was convicted at Croydon magistrates court in February after being remanded by police and fined £925.Stocia was convicted in absence at Westminster magistrates court on 10 April after failing to appear in court.

They expect Taiwan’s military and maybe police will be sent to frontlines, leaving civilian first responders in charge of care and control.Outside assistance would almost certainly be cut off by a blockade. Domestic train lines might be taken out, and airspaces closed to non-military flights like cargo. The internet and maybe phone signal would probably be cut off.If all this happened, Taiwanese residents could walk to one of the island’s more than 13,000 convenience stores to pick up rations and medical supplies, delivered by the chains’ own logistical transport systems, according to four people familiar with the discussions.They could read government communications which have been faxed to the stores and displayed on the window. Or maybe they would be able to send a message using the store’s emergency hotspot.Convenience stores, including 7-Elevens, worked with Taiwan’s government during the pandemic toration out masksduring the early times of shortages. Turning them into a wartime community hub would need a lot more preparation, but that is being discussed by a committee created by Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, to make his people resilient in the event of an attack or disaster.This idea is among a number of scenarios being considered by Lai’s team of 27 senior cabinet and national security ministers, NGOs, and figures from the business, social and religious sectors.The “whole of society defence resilience committee” is charged with preparing Taiwan’s society for war or disaster.China’s annexation plansChina’s government wants to annex Taiwan. It says this would ideally be peaceful but military force will be used if needed. Analysts say China is not capable of the required full-scale invasion yet, but is getting closer.In the meantime it bombards Taiwan with grey zone harassment; legal, economic, and cyberwarfare; disinformation and influence campaigns and espionage.China’s military also frequently rehearses blockades of Taiwan’s main island,as recently as last week.“If Taiwan loses its sea supply lines, its domestic resources will be quickly exhausted, and its social order will descend into chaos,” said academic and former Chinese general Meng Xiangqing on Wednesday.While hoping for the best, Taiwan is also preparing its citizens for the worst.View image in fullscreenScreenshot of aircraft carrier Shandong from a video released by the Eastern Theatre Command of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on 1 April 2025.Photograph: Eastern Theatre Command/Reuters“Faced with threats, whether they are natural disasters or authoritarian expansion ambitions, we believe that as long as the government and society as a whole are prepared, they can respond,” Lai told the committee at its second meeting in December.The aim of the committee is to ensure that in the event of a crisis the government and core services continue, critical supplies, networks and infrastructure are protected, and that the community can give civil support to the military if needed.A lot of the work builds oncivilian programmesalreadystarted by NGOs, and the tens of thousands of new disaster relief centres andevacuation and air raid shelters. There is also the existing government response strategies for Taiwan’s frequent earthquakes and the pandemic. Convenience stores served as community hubs for both.“Private businesses can play a crucial role in issues such as distributing critical supplies,” said Wen Lii, spokesperson for the president’s office.“Private businesses have also joined discussions on providing shelter space, medical supplies and stockpiling.”The committee has met just three times so far, but have already held one multi-branch tabletop exercise in December and one live drill in Tainan last week which involved civil responders and no military.The tabletop exercise revealed some glaring weaknesses, and dangerous presumptions. One department in charge of food provision had no plan for the police force being unavailable to distribute it.Another department representative had not considered they might be unable to post statements online or send communiques to neighbourhood leaders.“After the tabletop exercises, things changed very fast because every ministry realised how unprepared they are,” said Poyu Tseng, a consultant at NGO Doublethink Lab, and committee member focused on civilian force training and utilisation.“They’re just, one by one, realising, oh, this is a very weak plan … it’s forced people to think more.”Energy and communication systemsView image in fullscreenA satellite image taken recently shows three Chinese barges in waters off Zhanjiang city, in southern China’s Guangdong province. These could be used to land heavy equipment and thousands of personnel in a possible invasion of Taiwan, defence experts say.Photograph: Planet Labs PBC/AFP/Getty ImagesThere are also critical weaknesses in Taiwan’s energy and communications systems.Energy security is highly vulnerable to a blockade. About97% of Taiwan’s energy supply is imported. There are strategic reserves depending on the fuel type, with about 90 days worth of coal and petroleum and 40 days of liquid natural gas.“Energy will be the most critical problem that people will talk about, because the shelters, the transportation, the hospitals, they all need the energy,” said Dr Wen-ling Tu, a committee member focused on energy and critical infrastructure.The Research Institute for Democracy, Society And Emerging Technology (DSET), of which Tu is director, has analysed potential blockade scenarios and resulting electricity restrictions, finding a need for more renewables, while Ukrainian delegations have advised Taiwan to ramp up battery storage and power bank production.The state-owned Taipower’s electricity grid is also too centralised, with long transmission lines between large power plants all vulnerable to strikes.Tsai-ying Lu, director of DSET’s climate resilience and sustainability programme said the government is diversifying imports and pursuing renewables, but needs to improve incorporating solar and wind energy into the grid, and preparing the private sector for potential power cuts during a crisis.China is already exploiting Taiwan’s communication and information network frailties. In 2024 China made an average of2.4m cyber-attacks a dayon Taiwan’s government.They have hacked into Taiwan’s government websites, train station displays and 7-Eleven screens, and allegedlya hospital administration system. China is also suspected of cutting undersea cables that supply Taiwan’s internet.Taiwan does not have access to the Starlink satellite network after early negotiations with the Elon Musk-owned company fell over. Instead it is pursuingjoint commercial low-Earth-orbit coverage, and its own domestic system, including 700 hotspots planned across the country for government and military but potentially civilian use as well.Disinformation campaignBut before it takes out Taiwan’s internet and phone signals, Beijing would probably use them tospread disinformation and chaos. And Taiwan’s media is seen ashighly vulnerable to planted fake news.Staff at some major news outlets have described high quotas which allow little time for factchecking, while other outlets even have content sharing arrangements with Chinese state media.But there appears to be little official appetite to address this vulnerability – one government official suggested Taiwanese people were pretty sceptical about any news report already.Tseng said it is a “huge loophole”.“From a [foreign information manipulations and interference] perspective, I think we really need a stronger stance, especially on malicious actors.”The committee members and analysts who spoke to the Guardian were all cautiously optimistic about its goals.Some said there was not a clear sense of direction yet, although it was early days. Others worried about the bipartisan support needed for its success.View image in fullscreenPeople at a night market in Taipei. Defence analysts say Beijing could spread disinformation and chaos using Taiwan’s internet and phone signals.Photograph: Roland Nagy/Alamy“We are on the right direction, but the reason I’m not so confident about the implementation is because it also depends on what kind of the resources that we can gather to invest,” said Tu.Opposition parties currently control Taiwan’s legislature and have been slashing budgets including for Taipower (and its ability to strengthen its infrastructure) and for the ministry of digital affairs, which among other curtailment has had to drastically cut back the number of satellite hotspots being installed.The political division also affects social cohesion, said Tseng.“When you’re more polarised, you’re more chaotic, and when you’re more chaotic, you’re weaker,” she said. “Polarisation reverses resilience.”7-Eleven and other companies represented on the committee declined to comment.“For a society constantly threatened by natural disasters and other risks, there’s a useful principle: Don’t panic, but don’t relax,” said Wen Lii from the president’s office.“We need to achieve a balance, in which we continue to build confidence and ensure economic growth, while also raising awareness about potential threats.”Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But neither factor appears to have been what motivated the president’s sudden volte-face this week, when hepaused most of his “liberation day” border taxes for 90 days.The fact Trump could not ignore was amass sell-off by investors of US government bonds. But what exactly are bonds, how are they traded – and why are they so central to the current crisis?What is a bond?A bond is a certificate confirming that its owner has lent money to a specified borrower that will be repaid at a fixed date, typically with a fixed rate of interest. Known as fixed-income securities, they appeal to investors who want stable returns.Corporations issue bonds to borrow money and so do governments – to pay for investments and other expenditure. The UK government’s bonds are called gilts, while US government bonds are known as treasuries, traditionally seen as a safe haven because they are guaranteed by the world’s biggest economy. They are issued with different maturity dates when they must be paid off in full, with two-year, 10-year and 30-year bonds being common.How are they traded?Bonds can be bought and sold like shares on a secondary market – an exchange – but, unlike shares, they offer guaranteed annual returns. The bond market is the world’s biggest securities exchange, worth almost $130tn (£99tn), with the US market accounting for about 40% of debt worldwide.Government bonds are usually sold to financial institutions in auctions, and can then be resold on the secondary market for more or less than their face value.What is a bond yield?Bond yields represent the amount of money an investor receives for owning the debt as a percentage of its current price. When the price of a bond falls, yields rise. The yield is commonly referred to as an interest rate, or the cost of borrowing to an issuer.Rising yields suggest dwindling appetite to own the debt among investors, which can be influenced by a range of factors including an issuer’s ability to repay. For governments, this centres on the prospects for the country’s economy and finances.Inflation expectationsalso have a significant impact. This is because inflation undercuts the future value of money received for owning the debt. This means investors could demand a higher yield to compensate for the risk.And because other financial products, such as mortgages, are priced off the yield, there is a spillover into the broader economy.What have Trump’s tariffs done to bonds?At first the US president considered his tariff plan to be working, having anticipated stock markets would react badly to tariffs and the dollar would fall.Trump was sure the bond market would remain calm because he promised to pay for tax cuts later in the year with revenues from tariffs, meaning the US government could limit the number of bonds it issues, keeping supply and demand in sync and putting a cap on overall government debt levels.However, the tariff war has prompted fears of a US recession, making it riskier to lend to the US. There are concerns that the US will become locked in a titanic struggle with China, which would damage both economies over a long period and drag down global growth.In response, investors have sold US bonds in huge quantities, driving down their value and sending the yield higher, making future government debt more expensive to issue.Where did this leave Trump?There was a fear in the White House that paying a higher interest rate on national debt would increase the government’s annual spending deficit, adding pressure to an already stretched budget and increasing the overall debt mountain.Worse, the $29tn market in US treasuries is the bedrock of the global financial system and heavy selling could put pressure on other parts of it, forcing banks or other institutions to default and causing a wider financial crisis.Has the situation eased?After the US president said he would suspend punitive tariffs on all countries other than China for 90 days, bonds markets began to settle. However, yields remain high, with the effective interest rate on a 10-year Treasury bond at 4.52% on Friday compared with 3.99% on 4 April.Is this Trump’s Liz Truss moment?The UK’s 49-day prime minister was brought down by her own skirmish with the bond markets, whichconsidered her mini-budget to be reckless. That verdict sent the yield on UK gilts rocketing as bond values dropped like a stone, which forced mortgage companies to increase borrowing rates and wrecked Truss’s premiership.While Trump has more resources, he faces similar concerns about the spillover effects. If his policies do drive up inflation as expected, with some analysts forecasting a rate of 4.5% by next year, that could alienate the Republican core vote that brought him in on promises to cut soaring food prices. Voters could see tariffs as a tax on mortgages if banks start to charge more for home loans on the back of higher yields, denting his popularity with his base.Explore more on these topicsBondsGiltsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsTrump administrationexplainersShareReuse this content"

Following the news the show is to berebooted after 24 years off air, people have shared their recollections of its featured world record attempts, beloved and controversial presenters and theme song, Dedication.View image in fullscreenAndrew Brooke.Many of those who responded to the Guardian’s callout warmly remembered Roy Castle, one of the original presenters, as an all-round showbiz trouper. Castle, an accomplished trumpeter who performed Dedication at the end of each episode, broke nine world records himself and worked on the show until just months before his death from lung cancer in 1994.“Roy Castle brought joy to proceedings – I loved his warm and witty everyman persona,” said Andrew Brooke, 56, a retired teacher from Wells in Somerset. “Dedication must rank as one of the finest theme tunes in history, particularly as he sang and played a trumpet solo live each week. The lyrics were tweaked to fit the featured records attempts. I would occasionally sing them to inspire my pupils: ‘If you want to be the best, if you want to beat the rest, dedication’s what you need.’ Though there was usually no response at all from the children!”A letter from Roy Castle to Philip Reader.Brooke was one of many respondents who particularly enjoyed the attempts to break records live on the show. One that has stuck in his memory involved a barber trying to complete the most number of shaves in a minute: “He used a cut-throat razor on these men with five o’clock shadows and cut someone’s face in the process.”Sarah Shepley, 60, a retired scientist from Devon, recalled meeting Castle when she took part in two record attempts on the show in 1977. Then aged about 12, her church youth club in Ealing, west London, was invited toBBCWhite City to be part of a big tap dance ensemble in the courtyard. “We then joined a huge group of kids peeling onions. They gave us plastic knives for it which were useless. It was a hoot. Roy Castle sang ‘Don’t cry for me onion peeler’. Don’t Cry for Me Argentina was a No 1 hit that year. He was just a nice bloke, hilarious, a big kid.”A few people said the show inspired them to attempt to break records. Among them was Philip Reader, 56, from London, who back in his infant school in Brentwood in Essex roped in his best friend to see how far they could hop on one leg. He wrote to the programme and was delighted to receive a signed response from Castle, along with a “showbizzy” autographed photo. But he was disappointed to hear from the presenter that there was no recognised category for his record attempt.Reader, who works for Waitrose, said the show encouraged him to pursue his passion for music to this day. “It taught me about following your own ideas and not being afraid to stand out from the crowd,” he added. “‘Dedication’s what you need’ is the advice and encouragement that I have carried throughout my life.”View image in fullscreenMany readers said their memories of the show had been tainted after learning about the far-right politics of the two presenters, twins Norris and Ross McWhirter.Photograph: David Graves/Rex/ShutterstockAnother callout respondent had his hopes of breaking a record dashed by his parents’ revelations about a purportedly long-lived pet. Peter Allan, 60, a self-employed management consultant from East Renfrewshire, Scotland, said: “It was thanks to Record Breakers that I discovered my hamster had died.”Allan explained: “I had read that the average life expectancy of a hamster was 18 to 24 months. My 10-year-old self was so excited because my hamster ‘Jeemy’ was seven years old! I was busy composing a letter to Roy hoping Jeemy would become a record breaker when my dad informed me that Jeemy was actually Jeemy IV. Every time Jeemy died he was surreptitiously replaced. I was upset – not at the sad demise of my pets but at the wasted time and effort of letter writing!”Many readers said their childhood memories of the show have subsequently been tainted by learning about the far-right politics of the two other original presenters, twinsNorris McWhirterand Ross McWhirter.The Guinness World Records founders astounded many viewers with their recall of record-breaking facts and figures. But the brothers also co-founded the rightwing National Association for Freedom (Naff), later the Freedom Association, which campaigned against sporting sanctions imposed on apartheid-era South Africa.Ross McWhirter, who was assassinated by an IRA gunman in 1975, also advocated restrictions on the freedom of the Irish community in Britain, including compulsory registration with the police. Andrew Brooke said: “As my family is from Belfast, I guess that would have included us.”“As a child, Norris McWhirter just seemed to be a kindly old and eccentric uncle, wheeled out to amaze us with his remarkable memory,” Brooke added. “I also remember feeling very sorry for him after Ross was murdered.Terry ‘Turbo’ Burrow, who broke a record for cleaning windows, with presenter Cheryl Baker.Photograph: Handout“As I grew older and became more politically aware, I developed a severe aversion to Norris, after finding out that he ran a nasty rightwing thinktank. I couldn’t understand how the BBC would employ someone with such extreme views. Then again, vetting children’s TV presenters wasn’t exactly the BBC’s forte back then.”Other readers’ recollections of later series, after Norris McWhirter had left the show in 1985, were not tarnished by the subsequent presenters’ political leanings. Sue Wilde-Greer, 56, from Spain, recalled how her father, Mike, then a sales director for a window-cleaning kit company, was invited on the show in 1995 to judge an attempt to break the fastest window-cleaning record. “He loved being on the show,” she said. “He wore his best suit and we all sat down as a family to watch it.”The record-breakerTerry “Turbo” Burrowssaid his time on the show, then hosted by the former Bucks Fizz singer Cheryl Baker and the former Olympic and Commonwealth medal-winning athlete Kriss Akabusi was “truly amazing”. He went on to break his window-cleaning record a further nine times, bringing the record time down to 9.14 seconds.Explore more on these topicsChildren's TVBBCFactual TVTelevisionThe news on TVnewsShareReuse this content"

And this is a recurring theme in many of his updates on X.Be it sipping ale in the Turf Tavern in Oxford or downing much of a pint in one gulp while propped on a bar stool in a pub at new year, the traditional British thirst-quencher features regularly.Took a little break@TheTurfTavernpub, another place which the Emperor often visited during his time as a student@UniofOxford!pic.twitter.com/A3S83SI6Dw— Hiroshi Suzuki (@AmbJapanUK)March 3, 2025In the latter, he exclaims Happy New Year before pointing to a bottle clasped by a bemused bartender. “This is roku from Japan,” he says, before giving a thumbs up.

And features some unabashed product placement.Happy New Year !! ㊗️pic.twitter.com/jK3BbhyZiG— Hiroshi Suzuki (@AmbJapanUK)January 1, 2025Suzuki’s love for the UK spans all corners; he posted messages of goodwill on Burns Night (“Congratulations on Burns Night! Auld Lang Syne is very popular and always sung on graduation ceremonies”) and his rendition of the Welsh national anthem, posted on X, went viral.Looking forward to my trip to 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Hwyl, gweld chi’n fuan!pic.twitter.com/MGFtzZuEoC— Hiroshi Suzuki (@AmbJapanUK)January 6, 2025On St David’s Day, Suzuki posted a video of himself silently eating a Welsh cake, washed down with a cup of tea in a mug adorned with a red dragon, as well as highlighting a merging of the Japanese and Welsh cultures through his daffodils made from paper using origami.Dydd Gŵyl Dewi Hapus! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿pic.twitter.com/jeNHSdrYIK— Hiroshi Suzuki (@AmbJapanUK)March 1, 2025Sampling local delicacies is one of the most popular themes on Suzuki’s social media feed. Most recently, he was seen at Sarson’s vinegar factory in Manchester, a British name owned by the Japanese company Mizkan.“So when you enjoy fish and chips Sarsons is a must have, I just can’t think of fish and chips without Sarsons,” he says, before pouring the vinegar over a plate of fish and quietly sampling the fare, and giving his trademark thumbs up.Great visit to Sarson’s factory in Manchester!pic.twitter.com/DImdYICPkf— Hiroshi Suzuki (@AmbJapanUK)April 9, 2025In December, he feasted on New Forest ham and Sussex sparkling wine in a video explainer for geographical indication labels, that assure consumers of the authenticity of a product. “If you see kobe beef with this stamp, you can rest assured you’re going to get the real deal,” he says.GI (Geographical Indication) will give you a “real deal” of authenticity!pic.twitter.com/GMJqZ51cTr— Hiroshi Suzuki (@AmbJapanUK)December 20, 2024Further explaining his bond with the UK, Suzuki speaks of his passion for theSakura Cherry Tree Project.“In 2017, as a symbol of the never-changing friendship between Japan and the UK in the wake of Brexit, we started the project with Mr Keisaku Sandy Sano, then chairman of the Japan Association in the UK, and Mr Takashi Tsukamoto, then chairman of the Japan-British Society, to plant cherry trees across the UK,” he writes.“When we started, we set the target of planting 1,000 trees, but now we have planted 8,000 trees and they are blooming in many places in the UK.“Before I left Japan, the three of us got together again and set a new target of planting 10,000 trees. In Japan,ohanamiis a traditional springtime event, where people enjoy parties under the cherry blossoms.“I hope that British people throughout the country will similarly enjoy a day in spring by having a picnic under the cherry blossoms.”Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The actor chats stunts, space and why she’s hungry for moreFri 11 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTShareMost teenagers rebel against their parents in small ways: sneaking out, stealing a nip of Cointreau, arriving home past curfew. Not Varada Sethu, the Newcastle-raised actor who’s about to grace screens as new companion Belinda Chandra in the forthcoming season ofDoctor Who. Her rebellion took on a go-big-or-go-home attitude befitting a future screen star: when she was 18 she entered, and subsequently won, the Miss Newcastle beauty pageant. “Oh my God, I thought that was gonna be buried somewhere!” she exclaims when I bring it up. The whole thing was “kind of an accident”, she explains: “My sister and I were walking around in Eldon Square shopping centre, and they asked us if we wanted to enter, and I thought: ‘Yeah, I’ll give it a go’ – I thought it might piss off my parents a bit!”The decision to enter definitely caused “a bit of friction”, but Sethu’s parents didn’t raise a quitter. “On the day we had the rehearsals, I called my mum up and said: ‘I don’t want to do this, can you please take me home?’ And Mum was like: ‘Well, you’ve signed up for it, so you’re doing it,’” she recalls. “None of us expected me to win – the whole thing was a bit of a bodge job for me!”Now 32, the beauty pageant world “doesn’t really align with” Sethu’s value system, and her chosen vocation is miles – galaxies, really – away from that world of tiaras and special skills. In recent years, thanks to a starring role in the acclaimed Star Wars series Andor and her forthcoming turn as Belinda, as well as a part in the 2018 BBC drama Hard Sun, she’s become known as a go-to British sci-fi actor. “You don’t often see brown people in space – well, you do more than in other genres, because they’re futuristic – but I don’t think I necessarily saw myself as part of the sci-fi world,” she says. “So I don’t quite know how I ended up here, but I love it, and I’m very, very happy to be here.”View image in fullscreenScreen queen … Sethu as Belinda Chandra in episode two of the new series of Doctor Who.Photograph: James Pardon/BBC Studios/Bad WolfBorn in Kerala, India, Sethu moved with her parents and twin sister to Newcastle upon Tyne when she was six. Her entire family are artistic – her father sings and her mother is a dancer – but “everybody does it as a hobby”, so when she caught the acting bug after doing National Youth Theatre as a teenager, her parents insisted she pursue a veterinary degree as well. After a few months in vet school, she was ready to drop out. “[One day] my dad outright asked me: ‘Are you actually happy?’ and I completely fell apart. I was honest, saying: ‘No, this isn’t what I want to do – I want to follow my dreams, I want to go into acting,’” she says. “My mum thought it was an impulsive decision – she thought that I found uni quite hard and I didn’t want to do it any more, which is, you know, maybe a fair thing to say – I am impulsive!”After Sethu landed a few jobs – including in Russell T Davies’s 2016 TV adaptation of A Midsummer Night’s Dream – her mum came round. “When she saw that I’m able to support myself, [her opinion] changed,” she says. “She’s very much onboard now that she knows it’s what I love doing, and that I’ll find a way to survive.”Sethu’s breakout came in 2022 when she was cast as the medic Cinta Kaz in Andor, a prequel to the acclaimed 2016 Star Wars spin-off Rogue One. Andor has been praised as one of the best Star Wars properties in many years – the franchise has been hampered, of late, by a deluge of tepidly received streaming shows – and Sethu says she “knew that it would do well, because it’s such beautiful writing, it’s so considered and layered and complex”.In the show, Sethu’s character is in a same-sex relationship, still a rarity in mainstream franchises. “It meant a lot to me – I think the best thing about that part was that it wasn’t this huge deal, it was just normalised, nobody bats an eyelid,” she says. “I believe that’s how it should be. Unfortunately, there are certain parts of the world where it’s illegal to be gay or to be queer in any way. It’s a fundamental part of someone, but it’s also so arbitrary, and sadly there’s still a ways to go. So anything that is moving towards highlighting how totally normal and fine it is to be queer, I’m on board with. It meant a lot to have that representation in the Star Wars world as well – the first, I think we were told, openly queer relationship [in Star Wars].”View image in fullscreenHospital pass: Sethu and Ncuti Gatwa in episode one of the new series of Doctor Who.Photograph: James Pardon/BBC Studios/Bad WolfDespite the shows being vastly different, Andor gave Sethu a little bit of experience in terms of shouldering a massive, beloved franchise when it came to stepping into Doctor Who, which she wasn’t a fan of before appearing on the show. In 2023, she filmed a guest spot as a soldier who comes to the aid of the Fifteenth Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa) in the episode Boom, and later that year was asked to take a meeting to be Gatwa’s new companion. “I wasn’t expecting to come back,” she says. “It was amazing to be able to come back, and it was great because it didn’t feel like the first day at school, not knowing anybody – I had already had a little taste of it, and everyone knew me.”Although Sethu is forbidden from revealing too much about Belinda’s arc this season, she liked that “she was able to stand on her own, and she felt very much like the main character in her own story”, she says. “She felt very independent from the Doctor – it really feels like they’re equals.”Working with Gatwa, whose turn as the first non-white Doctor has won rave reviews, was a dream come true. “He’s so talented, and to watch him every day you have to match that energy. I think that’s what was great about us – if one of us was feeling knackered or whatever, the other one pulled our weight,” she says. “I never got sick of [seeing him act] – I’d think: ‘God, I can’t believe I’m getting paid to do this, to watch Ncuti, one of the greatest actors of our time, perform this great piece in front of me.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I don’t want to give a lot away!”In the meantime, Sethu is hoping to pick up roles outside of the sci-fi niche she’s becoming known for. “I’m hungry for more of all of it – drama, comedy, tragedy, all of it. I would love to do something silly, like a fun romcom, or a very, very serious drama,” she says. “The reason I went into acting, or what I love most about acting, is that you get to experience the full spectrum of the human experience – and sometimes outside of it. I love that I’ve been able to explore space without actually having to, you know … go there!”Doctor Who returns12 April, 6.50pm, BBC One.Explore more on these topicsDoctor WhoTelevisionFantasy TVDramainterviewsShareReuse this content"

One 2023surveyfound that 37% of US couples who live together have been to couples therapy. In 2022, nearly 30% of UK therapistsreporteda rise in the number of inquiries for couples counseling.I’m a sex educator. Here’s what you should know about sexual incompatibilityRead moreIt’s also more successful. “Success, how we define it, is the couple establishing a closer friendship, a closer sense of connection … and better conflict management,” says Dr Julie Gottman, a clinical psychologist and co-founder of the Gottman Institute. According to Gottman, the success rate of couples therapy used to be about 17%. Now, the Gottman Institute’smethodshave about a 75% success rate.But what about when a relationship truly seems to be on its last legs? Will a couples therapist ever tell a pair to break up?“I would not, personally,” says Siblo.Siblo says he has never directly told a couple that he thinks they should break up, because he doesn’t think it would be appropriate or productive.“I’m there to create a space of greater understanding,” he says. If that leads to people deciding to separate, Siblo can help them navigate that process. But telling a couple their relationship is not viable risks distracting them from the issues at hand; the focus becomes the therapist’s opinion rather than the pair’s relationship. Not only that, it could end up pushing the couple closer together by uniting them against a common enemy: the therapist.“It would backfire,” Siblo says.Telling clients what to do puts them in an “infantilized position”, says Gottman. If a couple is at a complete loss on how to move forward, Gottman might present them with several different options – including separation, in some cases – and talk them through each.The goal is to empathize and disarm some of the defensiveness or critical ways of communicatingDr Negin MotlagharaniGottman has intervened more directly in certain situations, she says, including cases involving domestic violence. There are two types of domestic violence, Gottman explains.Roughly 80% is “situational”, meaning both people are involved and the violence is mild to moderate – for example, pushing, shoving or slapping. In these cases, Gottman says, “both people really want to change” and “they both might feel deeply ashamed and guilty”. Situational domestic violence is often the result of both partners getting emotionally “flooded” – going into fight-or-flight mode – during conflict. This dynamic can be successfully resolved with proper couples therapy, Gottman says.But in the 20% of cases that are “characterological” – meaning there’s a clear victim and a perpetrator who takes no responsibility for the violence and inflicts major injuries – Gottman says intervention is appropriate.“It’s crucial that the couple break up and the [victim], typically the wife, get somewhere safe,” she says.In these instances, Gottman says she talks to the couple separately, and works with the victims on a safety plan to extricate themselves and any children from the relationships.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One of the biggest is that it will serve as a sort of courtroom in which one partner will be declared guilty, and the other innocent.“Everybody comes to couples therapy assuming that their perspective is going to be vindicated by the therapist, and that the other person is going to see the error of their ways,” says Siblo.Take good pictures and embrace the apps: how to start datingRead moreThe goal is not to decide who is right and wrong, but to provide partners a greater understanding of why they behave the way they do within a relationship.“The goal is to empathize and disarm some of the defensiveness or critical ways of communicating, and engage in perspective taking,” says Motlagharani. People also need to understand that their partner is their own person with their own ideologies, beliefs and opinions. “It’s OK for you to disagree as long as there is compassion,” says Motlagharani.All of this is no small task, and can take time. Siblo says clients often expect couples therapy to move more quickly than it actually does. “Nobody should expect anything in only 10 to 12 sessions,” he says.Ultimately, therapists say that only a couple can decide if what they need to do is to separate.“How can I be so arrogant as to think I know what’s best for somebody?” Gottman says.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyCounselling and therapyRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But with his acting career taking off and a genre-jumping new solo album, one of rock’s great polymaths is backFri 11 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTShareSitting in the belly of north London’s Islington Assembly Hall in the middle of four sold-out nights,TV on the Radiofrontman Tunde Adebimpe is recalling the precise moment he wanted to quit his band – and music – for ever. It was 2019 and the group, an art-rock four-piece who haven’t made a record that wasn’t adored by critics since emerging from Brooklyn in the early 00s, were opening for Weezer and Pixies at Madison Square Garden in New York.Over the years, they’ve made five studio albums and also lost bass playerGerard Smith, who died suddenlyin 2011. They’ve grieved and grown together. Adebimpe is their talisman. A tall, expressive focal point, able to rabble-rouse with songs such asWolf Like Me, or calm the congregation with low-slung tracks such as DLZ orYoung Liars.But by 2019, the ties that bound the band had begun to fray, due to a familiar mix of a demanding tour schedule and too much time living in each other’s pockets. “It should have been such a high point,” says Adebimpe of the Madison Square Garden gig. “But I remember thinking: ‘That was a good show, but I just never want to do this ever again.’”I had a very weird feeling of: I just want silence … as much as I can getThe malaise went further than one performance after a hard tour. “There’s a point where I had a very weird feeling of, like: ‘I think I’m done,’” he says, a few flecks of white in his beard giving away the fact he’s about to turn 50. “I think I’m just done listening to music. I don’t give a fuck about bands. I just want silence … as much as I can get it.”Adebimpe pressing pause seems about as likely as Donald Trump staying silent. Over the past 25 years, he has become one of the world’s most successful creative chameleons. The son of middle-class Nigerians who moved between St Louis, Pittsburgh and Lagos during his childhood, Adebimpe is able to oscillate between hyperbolic indie frontman, actor and visual art practitioner (he once worked as an animator on MTV’s Celebrity Deathmatch).He and TV on the Radio emerged in the aftermath of 9/11, in pre-gentrification Williamsburg, New York. Adebimpe lived in a loft offered to him by a friend. “He brings me to the third floor of this place, and it’s just, like, plywood on the windows and it’s freezing cold,” he recalls. “Just imagine a gigantic empty floor at the very end of it, there’s a lightbulb, a toilet and a sink, but you can see all of the pipes … going into the ground. And he’s like: ‘Yeah, we’re still working on it.’” The upside was the rent, $100 a month, which gave Adebimpe the space to work on the nascent version of TV on the Radio with guitarist Kyp Malone (they left copies of 2002’s OK Calculator, their ultra-rare debut CD, in Williamsburg coffee shops). But music wasn’t Adebimpe’s only pursuit. He also tried acting while at university and he has recently carved out a third career in film.On screen, he has proved incredibly versatile, able to handle the arthouse demands of being a lead in Sebastián Silva’s Nasty Baby and also deliver tender performances in Disney+ Star Wars spin-off Skeleton Crew and weather disaster sequel Twisters. The Hollywood moments have transformed the way his young daughter Echo (Adebimpe is married to French cartoonist Domitille Collardey) sees him. He’s gone from “dad who potters around in the garage with music and puppets” to a movie star. “There was a premiere for the first Skeleton Crew episode at Disneyland, and she was sitting next to me the whole time hitting me, just like: ‘You’re in this, daddy,’” he says, mimicking her shock and awe. “I was like … ‘I know.’”View image in fullscreenTunde AdebimpePhotograph: Xaviera SimmonsToday, we’re here to talk about his latest transformation, into a solo musician; a move that came after TV on the Radio’s mini-implosion. After the tour, he implemented a music ban. Then weeks passed. Slowly, Adebimpe, who’d thrown himself into making art, started to feel the musical urge. “It’s like a patch of weeds that you clip,” he says. “Things grow back, and thoughts grow back, and you hear melodies. I started having fun again, I was really trying to go back to zero.”After the hard reset, Adebimpe disappeared into his garage in Silver Lake, Los Angeles. He began to play with old demos. Mostly using simple drum machines and a couple of synths, he started crafting what would become the basis for his debut solo record, Thee Black Boltz. It sees Adebimpe and his co-producer, Wilder Zoby, the former frontman of Brooklyn indie-funk band Chin Chin, play with pop, hip-hop and glam rock, while snarling it all up with distortion and pounding drum patterns. If some of TV on the Radio’s more expansive songwriting pushedthe limits of what rock could be, Thee Black Boltz sees Adebimpe detach completely from the mothership and set off to coordinates unknown.It almost didn’t happen. Adebimpe had been shopping around some demos in 2020 and got a lot of polite nos. “I wasn’t expecting that much, but it was a very humbling experience,” he said. “Whatever cultural capital in the back of my head that I thought I, or we, might have amassed, didn’t exist.” Then he changed tack and decided to approach labels that had inspired him growing up. Sub Pop, the home of Nirvana and Earth, bit his hand off.The album’s lead single, the throbbing electropop of Magnetic, was a statement of intent but also a red herring. The record jumps between genres constantly. Ate the Moon and Blue aren’t far off the industrial hammer blows of Nine Inch Nails; Pinstack has the swagger of glam; second single, Drop, is gentle pop underpinned with scuzzy beatboxing; while The Most combines pulsing stabs of synthesiser with a sample of dancehall classicUnder Mi Sleng Teng.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The sentiment is: this is a gift for youThat might sound overwhelming, but it’s all tied together with Adebimpe’s voice – baritone and rich as ever – and lyrics that are nearly always about love, lost or otherwise. “It feels like the kind of mixtape I would have given to somebody in high school and said: ‘Here’s a couple of my favourite bands,’” says Adebimpe. “It all hangs together because the sentiment is: this is a gift for you.”TV on the Radio review – NYC art-rockers remain singular, energised and lupineRead moreOne song that stands out is ILY, a soft ode dedicated to Adebimpe’s younger sister, Jumoke, who died suddenly just as the Covid pandemic was nearing its end. She lived in Florida; his father had died and Adebimpe’s mother had moved back to Nigeria, so the responsibility fell on him to make arrangements. “I was the only family member, so I had to go down and essentially plan this funeral in the course of a week, call all of my relatives, put them on Zoom during this thing. I had to give the eulogy … in a mask,” he says, lowering his head. “It was the worst possible thing.”The song became a way for Adebimpe to channel his grief. “I had a sketch for it, and when we started writing the record, I found that again, and then finished it pretty quickly. I’m glad that had been floating around and I had a venue for those feelings, because your grief is proportional to the amount of love you have for this person who is, like …” he pauses. “I mean, she’s my best friend and I’m glad I had a place to put that.”The patch of weeds grew back, again.Thee Black Boltz is released via Sub Pop on18 April.Explore more on these topicsMusicTV on the RadiofeaturesShareReuse this content"

How do I move on?Your sadness at losing reminders of happier times may have been heightened by the traumatic loss of your dadEvery week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a problem sent in by a readerAnnalisa BarbieriFri 11 Apr 2025 09.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 13.32 EDTShareNot long before the Covid pandemic, my dad threw out my cardboard box ofmementoes that I had stored in his garage for“safekeeping”: years’ worth of personal journals, Polaroids and photos with no negatives, love letters, all of my degree essays, reams of teenage poetry, etc – the classic priceless timecapsule stuff that one looks forward torevisiting one day.It was one of his final acts before taking his own life, so it was a doublewhammy of bereavement in which my first loss was buried by the second. And, with the pandemic arriving shortly afterwards, it stayed buried for further years as, again, I was distracted by somethingelse serioushappening. But once that hadpassed, the original grief returned with a vengeance and has become an abiding sorrow that’s been difficult to shake off: the feeling that part of me died when that box went into landfilland can never be recovered, and how its significance seems to grow with time, not diminish.I know it’s just“stuff”, as people have reminded me when I’ve told them about it, but I don’t know why it remains so significant,or how to truly get over it. I’ve spent so much time cursing myself for notliberatingthat box a lot sooner and keeping it with me – I’d been moving from house to house throughout the previous decade, so kept it atDad’s for practicalreasons.Any advice would be appreciated.I’m often amazed how people bury seismic news within other details. What you have suffered is a significant tragedy and loss, and I’m sorry.I went to bereavement specialist Mandy Gosling, whose first comment was: “What happened to you was devastating. Objects as symbols can bridge our inner and outer world, linking memories, perhaps, to feelings in the body. The feelings evoked by what was in your memory box sound like good feelings that you want to revisit.”Is it any surprise you want to revisit these feelings? Almost as if the recovery of the box may undo all the tragedy of what happened afterwards? The “before”? “The box isn’t just ‘stuff’,” Gosling said: “They are your memories from your past and hold something special for you.”You are allowed to feel angry about your dad’s actions – it doesn’t dilute the love you felt for himGosling added that compounded grief, when there is loss layered upon loss, “can add to the intense feelings. It’s sometimes difficult to separate out losses so there may be a sense of overwhelm or heightened response about the box, which is associated with the traumatic loss of your dad. It may even seem easier to grieve the box than face your dad’s death? Complicated grief is prolonged and intense.”Whenever we are presented with difficult feelings, we often dip a toe in the water and then pull back before things can get too painful. But in so doing we can’t ever really explore and process those feelings, and processing grief is essential if we are to fold it into our lives.I wonder if you could really lean in (we’d prefer it if you did this with someone such as a therapist or grief counsellor) to how you feel. Imagine you did keep the box – what then? Would you look at it? Would it really help you now? Could you make a new, different memory box by asking friends of that time for any mementoes. The reality is that you probably wouldn’t look in the box very much and there was a valid reason you kept it at your dad’s – can you think why that might have been?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

How can I set some boundaries? | Ask Annalisa BarbieriRead more“Both of your losses,” says Gosling, “need to be grieved. There is no getting over it, but you can find ways to integrate them into your life.” In terms of remembering the contents of the box, Gosling recommends “you do some visualisations of what was in the box, see how remembering the items feels in your body”.By thinking of it as “just stuff” you’re not really allowing yourself to grieve and process its loss, so you’re stuck in melancholia and not allowing yourself to mourn. Also, you are allowed to feel angry about your dad’s actions – it doesn’t dilute the love you felt for him.

Behold: sunshine, green shoots, cherry blossom, fresh hope and all that good stuff. And, soon, a glut of bank holidays during which we can unveil our factor 50-smeared knees at the seaside and quickly declare that it’s far too hot.But not all British seaside experiences are built the same. Nibbling a Waldorf salad while sipping a glass ofOxney organic English sparklingat the charmingHarry’sat the Gallivant hotel on the East Sussex coast is not remotely similar to scoffing a battered sausage on Blackpool front. Both have their merits, but Harry’s is a far more refined affair, it being a recently restyled and renamed restaurant inside a blissful, bougie boutique hotel. This is a hotel, incidentally, that will create a sort of Famous Five Do Santa Monica seaside experience for you, albeit at a price. Cocktails on the sand dunes? They’ll mix and pack them in flasks, and find you suitable garments to wear, too. A spot of flow yoga before your breakfast ginger shot? Not a problem, madam. Then, later on, dinner atHarry’sby Matthew Harris, once of Bibendum (and, incidentally, brother of Henry ofBouchon Racinefame), for a menu that focuses on the heartier, homelier side of classic French cookery. Terrine de campagne with pistachios, oysters with sauce mignonette, braised rabbit in riesling and St Émilion au chocolat for pudding, that kind of thing.View image in fullscreen‘Generous, crisp-skinned and perfectly cooked’: Harry’s hake with sauce Maltaise.Regular readers will know my thoughts on restaurants inside fancy hotels, and their habitual tyranny of deadly dull, overpriced menus that trap hotel guests who know no better. They’re rarely allowed to fancy something as sating as “lamb chop and chips”; no, they have to be hostage to nine courses of consommé and froth. Harry’s, I stress most emphatically, is not at all like this. First, it is not fussy or stiff, although it is decidedly glamorous, and a bit like a 1950s beach shack given a Soho Farmhouse makeover. Dim, smoky lighting, soft music, tables positioned strategically for maximum privacy, with giant fronds placed between the closer-together ones, so you could be dining next to Tom Cruise and feasibly not even suss.We began with a plate of smoked eel and a soft, runny boiled egg perched on the plate alongside an assertively mustardy celeriac remoulade. We also ordered that old-school favourite, the Waldorf salad, made with apple, grapes, celery and walnuts, which has become something of a joke in recent times, and possibly why it’s so rarely seen on menus these days. In fact, it’s almost impossible to eat one – especially one served out of a silver sundae bowl and decorated with a delicate parmesan crisp – and not feel as if you’re Wallis Simpson. Those two starters, along with a round of oysters, were pretty much faultless.View image in fullscreen‘Impossible to eat without feeling as if you’re Wallis Simpson’: Harry’s Waldorf salad.Next up, a generous slab of hake with crisp skin and perfectly cooked flesh on what looked like a mermaid’s seat of monks beard and pine nuts, and dressed with an orange segment-flecked sauce Maltaise (that’s a hollandaise made with orange for anyone not au fait with French classic cookery, though it will be impossible to remain so by the time you leave Harry’s). This restaurant calmly serves precise, timeworn recipes using techniques dating from Escoffier onwards, but without making a huge song and dance about it. No one talked us through the dishes at any great length, or demanded that we pay due homage to the chef’s prowess. Quite the opposite: plates were delivered to our table with a cheery “Bon appetit!”, as if they were just serving cod and chips.Even so, when a humble Barnsley chop comes with a good, fresh, rich hazelnut pesto, you know you’re not really in a place that’s truly casual. A side of champ could perhaps have been more buttery and the sauteed spinach was forgettable, but both were more than made up for by a slice of another much-ignored classic, St Émilion au chocolat, which is what happens when amaretti biscuits are soaked in sherry, topped with a rich chocolate cream and chilled for many, many hours, so the boozy biscuits and cream meld together into something that’s truly majestic.View image in fullscreen‘Truly majestic’: Harry’s St Émilion au chocolat.This was a startlingly good dinner, and it was lovely to get some sand between my toes and remember that there is a world out there beyond the radiator, the hot-water bottle and the seasonal affective disorder lamp.

Rory McIlroy had opted to keep his thoughts to himself after thewounding end to his first roundat the 89th Masters. An inspired follow up by the Northern Irishman made it easy to assume he had taken things personally. Did you think the two double bogeys in four closing holes ended his latest attempt at claiming the career grand slam? Think again. Courtesy of spellbinding, stunning golf, McIlroy blasted his way through the Georgia pines and back into contention.Statistical gurus had insisted glory was already beyond him. Craig Stadler was the last man to triumph here with more than one double bogey on his card. That happened in 1982. What the numerati failed to acknowledge was that McIlroy had 54 holes to recover. With 36 remaining, he sits two from Justin Rose. Buckle up.McIlroy’s front nine of 35 was solid and unspectacular. He reached the turn and hit the accelerator. The 35-year-old also demonstrated why he remains golf’s most entertaining player. Rory-land is seldom dull. “It is only halfway,” McIlroy said. “Anything can happen.” He knows that better than anybody in this field.Rory McIlroy back in the mix after prayers answered around Amen CornerRead moreA magnificent approach to the 10th left a tap in birdie. He had only a little more to do at the 11th. On the 12th, McIlroy encountered the kind of good fortune that suggested someone, somewhere might finally be looking favourably upon his Masters quest. His tee shot flew towards foliage after a wicked greenside bounce. Seconds later, the ball emerged close to the putting surface. He retrieved a par three. His second to the par-five 13th was jaw-dropping, from pine straw and 214 yards to within 10ft of the cup. Eagle landed. At the next, he looked in serious difficulty amid trees. He launched an outrageous iron to inside 20ft. “I rode my luck on 13 and 14,” McIlroy said. “I feel like those are the sorts of things that need to happen in major championships.” This felt needlessly self-deprecating.The 15th, where McIlroy had come unstuck a day earlier, delivered a birdie. At the 17th, another Thursday nemesis, he was unfortunate not to collect another shot. A routine par at the last and a day’s work added up to 66. This matches his career-best second round at Augusta. That pair of Thursday scorecard blemishes aside, McIlroy has not dropped a shot. For 34 out of 36 holes, he has looked in complete command.Corey Conners later joined McIlroy on six under. Scottie Scheffler hovers, obviously, as does Tyrrell Hatton. Scheffler received a piece of outrageous luck at the 12th before chipping in for a birdie two. He would be the most infuriating of opponents. Both Scheffler and Hatton closed on five under after messy finishes.Rose reached eight under par in battling fashion, courtesy of a 71. The Englishman had to scrap and scrape for much of his morning. Understandably, he branded this a “decent day”.View image in fullscreenJustin Rose splashes out of the bunker on the 17th hole on his way to a 71.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersThe high points involved birdies at the par threes, the 12th and the 16th, after glorious tee shots. Rose did, however, hand sloppy shots back to the course at the 14th and 17th. A dozen years have flown by since he won his only major, at Merion’s US Open. He smiled when asked whether Masters victory would mean more to him now, at the age of 44.“I’ll take it anytime, beggars can’t be choosers,” Rose said. “I would take it right now for sure. Sometimes if it happens too early in your career, you’ve got a lot to live up to. I think if it happens now, I would enjoy it, I think, probably a lot more. You know, come a bit more as a gift towards the end of your career. So I think there would be a lot more satisfaction in it for sure.”Bryson DeChambeau is threatening to have the last laugh at those who derided him for once declaring Augusta National played as a par 67. A sixth-placed finish here last year preceded victory at the US Open. Now, DeChambeau has eyes fixed on holding half of golf’s majors at one time. A 68 (one over?) means he is just one adrift of Rose. The American punched the air at the last having holed out from 8ft for par. It is easy to fixate on his occasionally wild theories and obsession with content creation; the fact is he has developed hugely as a competitive force. DeChambeau will do things his way and his way has an increasing tendency to work. “I’m learning,” he said. “I have a little more wisdom than the last year and hopefully the year before.

Things fall apart. But sometime they also don’t. And the centre does actually hold.Perhaps the most interesting part ofMohamed Salah’s contract extensionat Liverpool is the fact this is a rare crossover story, a signing that steps outside its own tribal margins. There will of course be localised delight. Liverpool fans can look forward to their own lost weekend in the sun, a sense that the good times will now continue to roll, that the time bar has shifted. Return to your seats. This is a lock-in.Salah signs new Liverpool deal and is challenged by Slot to ‘reach perfection’Read moreMore widely, Salah staying is a shot of adrenaline for the Premier League, which is sold on fat, wet personality driven storylines, a star factory that does sometimes have to scrape the walls for actual stars. The commercial logic is obvious. Salah is the league’s best player. Salah is the most famous African footballer. Salah is the biggest sporting star in the Muslim world.Salah is also a one-man blue-chip brand, instantly recognisable, the beaming, scurrying cartoon squirrel of elite football, his cut-through benevolent and broad. Never mind Liverpool’s global fanbase. Richard Masters will have been doing the running man in his underpants on Friday morning. This is like Disney re-signing Mickey Mouse.Given the widely trailed nature of the deal it will be necessary now to have takes about the takes, to identify wider points of jeopardy. With this in mind it perhaps won’t be long before some contrarian suggests that if Liverpool’s owners really are the hedge fund sharks of the popular imagination, all vampire teeth, faces thin and glossed as the corporate credit card, they will put Salah up for sale.Seriously. Sell him to Paris Saint-Germain for £90m this summer. This would be the economically rational decision. Instant gain for the cost of a little ink and some printed sheets. Corporate policy retained. Duty to shareholders observed. Nothing personal kids. It’s always, always business.This would also be entirely wrong, of course, and for reasons that go beyond armed insurrection in L4. The fact is Liverpool’s executive had no choice. Losing Salah for nothing would have been sackable corporate incompetence. Here is your data outlier, a player with 32 goals and 22 assists this season. Here is your chief branding item, the most followed Premier League player on social media by an absolute mile, a one-man bonus streaming rights deal.Plus there is a kind of institutional debt here. Salah’s presence over the past eight seasons has defined not just an era of success, the lifting of an emotional cloud, but the owners’ wondrous returns on their financial investment. There is an argument it would make commercial and cultural sense for FSG to pay Salah just to sit in the stands for the next two years, put him on gardening leave, pay him to wave on posters.So yes, there is no downside on the face of it. Except, this is football, and there must always be variables, lurking doom, potential collapse, all of which are key to the game’s strangely inelastic appeal. The fact is, this is not entirely a free ride. It comes with challenges, not least for Arne Slot.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah has provided relentless value for money for Liverpool.Photograph: Nikki Dyer/LFC/Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesSigning Salah doesn’t change one key point. With or without him, next season still has to be the start of a rebuild. There was a tendency during the first half of the season, as Slot’s team played with a kind of light around them, to dismiss Jürgen Klopp as a kind of woad-smeared energy guy, to see Slot sifting successfully through the parts, finally bringing order to this first draft of history.By now it seems clear the current title-bound season is also a hybrid triumph. Slot has overseen the first fix with remarkable skill. But he will now have to effect a more profound building job. For the first time there will be a slight sense of pressure around Salah too.The football has very clearly not left him, is still clinging to his collar, giddy on the ride. Salah isn’t even very old. It might seem as though he has been around for ever, 10 years since he was skittering down the Chelsea right, peak malevolent José Mourinho up there taking bites on his touchline, but Salah is 32, not 35.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Salah’s form – we can talk about this now – has been poor. In seven games since the Etihad he has had three shots on target. He has scored one league goal from open play at Anfield since Boxing Day. He has basically been a shadow since the home leg against PSG.Slot knows Salah-dependence in attack has been the story of the season up to a point, which is fine as long as it worksThe Roy Keane theory of Big-Men-For-Big-Stuff would see this as shrinking in the face of destiny. But it would also be wrong to suggest Liverpool have dipped because Salah has dipped, rather than the other way round or, as ever, a bit of both. Teams are more complex than this. Slot has always seemed more interested in Salah’s defensive work, which has been good this season, and speaks more clearly to his ability to fit an evolving shape.But Slot also knows Salah-dependence in attack has been the story of the season up to a point, which is fine as long as it works. This has to change, and with a little less in the way of revolution now.Slot also knows he owes Salah. The manager has been rightly praised for his tinkering, his command of small details. But it is clearly a bonus on this front when you also happen to have a ruthless goal maniac up front justifying every choice by kicking the ball into the net. The more I walk around the place with my finger on the trigger of this AK-47 the more people keep calling me a genius and laughing at all my jokes.From here Slot still needs not only a post-Salah plan but a current one too. Salah’s departure would have been a disaster. But it would at least have offered something closer to scorched earth, a refresh from ground zero. No doubt some will point out PSG got shot of Kylian Mbappé two years too late. Salah barely registers on the Mbappé Scale of mega-divas, but he does have an ego, does say stuff in the mixed zone when it suits him, does look cross when he gets subbed off. This will require managing.Salah is also the one player in the league who has basically just given for the last eight seasons, offering up only relentless value for money. He deserves this two-year run into whatever version of the future Slot can build around him. All logic suggests that job just got a little easier. But it will come with challenges too. Caveat re-emptor. The rebuild still starts here.Explore more on these topicsMohamed SalahLiverpoolcommentShareReuse this content"

Wafer lays down the gauntlet to the defending champions on a video call, which she joins fresh from training in full kit, with her leg still strapped with tape.Belief and confidence emanate through the laptop screen as she speaks about the possibility of ending England’s 31-game dominance in the tournament in Cork. “We want to show them that Ireland are not just there to sit down, we want to put it up to them,” the 22-year-old says. “We will have parts of our game we really want to go after and we think will work and maybe shock the English a little bit. We are all raring to go.”Women’s Six Nations 2025: team-by-team guide to the tournamentRead moreThe possibility of beating England, something Ireland have not done in a decade, may seem out of reach on the surface but Ireland’s progress in the past 12 months suggests an upset is attainable. In April 2024 Ireland lost 88-10 to England, conceding the most points they ever have against the Red Roses, but they ended the Six Nations tournament in third.Their finishing spot qualified them for WXV 1 where they defeated New Zealand, the world champions, 29-27, a game in which Wafer scored two tries, and also recorded a victory over the USA. In the opening two rounds of the 2025 Women’s Six Nations they ran France close in a 27-15 loss and claimed their first Six Nations away win since 2021 in a huge 54-12 victory against Italy.Wafer, who spent some time in her home county of Wexford during the fallow week, credits the uptick in form to many different factors. The Celtic Challenge competition has allowed time for combinations between players to grow, “crucial” players who compete in sevens rugby have returned to the 15s game and there has been a shift in culture – spearheaded by the leadership and culture lead, Sean Ryan. Wafer says the new coaching staff, including the head coach, Scott Bemand, who was previously England’s backs coach, and their honest approach have made a big difference.She says: “They have impacted us in a huge way. It has just accelerated the way that we play. They bring that honesty factor and they are not afraid to be honest and be brave in that which trickles down into what we do.“I think in the past there has probably been that thing of: ‘Oh, I don’t want to say X because it might hurt their feelings or it might not make them happy.’ But the lads and us as a group are very conscious that sometimes if someone hasn’t done something right they just need to be told because they might not even know. That honesty, it is there because at the end of the day we want Ireland to be successful.“You need to know if you are doing it right or wrong. It’s honesty whether that is good or bad. It’s celebrating big wins and working on the little things.”View image in fullscreenEngland’s Ellie Kildunne goes over to score during England’s 88-10 rout of Ireland last year.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The ObserverAll of those factors have produced magnificent wins for the team and while they have improved several elements of their performances, for Wafer it is their adaptability from game to game which is bringing this Irish team results. Wafer, who was voted Ireland’s player of the year in 2024, says it is not something the group had in their back pocket previously and that it is what teams need to do in order to be successful.She adds: “I think on our day and when we are at our best, we can beat anybody. That is something that has changed in our mindsets, we all believe that. We acknowledge that England are the best in the world but we also believe that we can do a job and that we can put our gameplan into action on Saturday. They are the best in the world but we also have a point to prove too.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When Wafer’s message is delivered to Botterman, she responds: “Every team is going to say that. It is if they can actually back it up and do it. We don’t focus massively on the opposition, we have things we go after game to game but our focus is on ourselves and how we want to play.“It is great for Ireland and for a lot of teams. Sometimes they can go into games and probably not have a lot of hope that they are going to come away with the result that they want.“For Ireland coming off WXV1 and this Six Nations they are going to be full of confidence and belief coming into this game. It is our job to shut that down as quickly as possible.”Cork is expecting a sell-out crowd for the visit of the favourites. If the hosts do win it would not only shake up England but the entire tournament, and leave Ireland as unexpected title contenders.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Six NationsIreland women's rugby union teamEngland women's rugby union teamWomen's rugby unionRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rice had never scored a free kick in 338 appearances but said Jover’s instructions “didn’t make sense” and opted to shoot instead after being encouraged by Bukayo Saka.“They have to make the decision,” said Arteta. “We are here to help them, to paint the picture of what the options are, but I loved it. When we talk about taking the next step, it is a lot about that: taking the initiative, making things happen on the pitch and believing you can actually win the game by yourself sometimes. I was really impressed with the way he did it.”The manager added: “It’s related to confidence as well and feeling and owning that moment, which is really important. So there’s no coincidence that all the top teams, you look at their games in the Champions League, the amount of individual moments that won the football matches … that’s a necessity.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bukayo Saka has just returned from a similar injury that caused him to miss three months and the Champions League final on 31 May is a potential target for Havertz should Arsenal make it to Munich.“Let’s see,” Arteta said when asked whether Havertz could be back before the end of the season. “The mindset of those two is very, very similar. Great injury history, great work ethic, desperate to get back playing as quick as possible. And great medical staff as well to look after them. So hopefully we can have him, but let’s wait, I think.

It means a career haul of 1,126 first-class wickets will only swell further.“Congratulations SirJimmy Anderson,” said Richard Thompson, the current chair of the England and Wales Cricket Board. “This is a really well-deserved honour for an England legend who has given so much to our sport.“Jimmy’s career has been marked by extraordinary achievements, not least in winning the Ashes four times and becoming England’s all-time leading wicket-taker.“His skill, determination, and sportsmanship have inspired millions of cricketers and fans alike, in England and around the world.“This is fitting recognition for a true world-great who has given so much to the game on and off the field.”View image in fullscreenJimmy Anderson bowls during an Ashes Test at Old Trafford in 2023.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAnderson, whose 188 Test caps are second only to India’s Sachin Tendulkar (200), is the third English cricketer of his generation to receive the honour, with former teammates Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook both knighted back in 2019.Lancashire’s director of cricket performance, Mark Chilton, said:“Everybody associated with LancashireCricketis incredibly proud of James. “His contribution to the game of cricket, spanning across three decades, has been immense and he is extremely deserving of this honour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Everything points to a chance for McLaren to dominate at the Sakhir circuit but there may also be some indication if Red Bull are making real steps forward with their car.ForMcLaren, Bahrain is a chance to throw off their hoodoo at the track where they have never won and at which, in recent years, they have struggled for form. This season in testing at the circuit they gave their first evidence that they had a much-improved package; one swiftly reinforced with dominant victories for Lando Norris in Australia and then his teammate, Oscar Piastri, in China.Robert Reid, deputy president for sport, becomes latest FIA executive to resignRead moreLast week in Japan a combination of exceptionally low tyre degradation on a newly resurfaced circuit and it being all but impossible to overtake, meant track position was crucial and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen converted a stunning pole to a superb win.The circumstances at Suzuka were very much an outlier however; in Bahrain if the McLaren is as strong as has been anticipated they can expect to show it. In hot conditions on a high degradation track its advantage in being very easy on the tyres, allied to a fearsome pace, could lead to a whitewash. If it does it would be an ominous signal of the gap the rest must bridge.McLaren, as has often been the case this year, are playing down their chances and there is the caveat that their car can be difficult to wrangle over a single lap on low fuel, making it trickier to qualify, but in race pace Piastri conceded the MCL39 was as good a ride as he has ever had.“This has not been a great track for us in the past couple of years, well even longer than that, to be honest,” he said. “So it will be a good test for us. But we’re as confident as we have been in my time at the team. We are in a position to win this weekend.”For the understated Australian, those words are the verbal equivalent of ripping off his shirt, beating his chest and declaring the opposition might like to eat his shorts.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri, signing a cap for a fan, is in a confident mood before the Bahrain Grand Prix.Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Formula 1/Getty ImagesVerstappen remained optimistic that the steps his team were taking were bringing their car back into contention, having remarkably managed to stay just one point behind the championship leader, Lando Norris, with Piastri 13 points back in third. However, the numbers the Dutchman may be more interested in are how close he can stay to the McLarens in the desert. Pulling another win out of the bag on Sunday would be extraordinary.McLaren’s major test in Bahrain then may be how best to manage their approach and the two drivers, both of whom are hungrily eyeing the title. Norris was critical of the team’s strategy in Japan, where he was second, unable to pass Verstappen on track after a conservative pit stop strategy. “Could it have been better and could we have potentially taken more risks and been a bit more attacking as a team? Yes,” he said, “I am here to win races and not settle for second, so definitely I would love to kind of go back and redo things with a slightly more aggressive approach.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With 21 races to go clocking up every possible point may be crucial. But their decision not to switch drivers in Japan to allow Piastri a shot at Verstappen was questioned as demonstrating a lack of will to hurl their all into the attack.Equally, the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, has noted that McLaren have made their position harder by insisting on allowing both drivers to race freely. They will take points off one another and Verstappen will keep chipping away to stay on their tails.The McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, reiterated in Bahrain his belief that having two top performing drivers was a benefit rather than a hindrance, with each pushing the other on to greater heights. Certainly in practice in Bahrain the McLaren looked absolutely formidable. Norris was on top in the first runs, two-tenths clear of Alpine’s Pierre Gasly. While in the second session Piastri had the edge, a tenth up on his teammate but a full half a second ahead of Mercedes’ George Russell in third, with Verstappen, eight-tenths down in seventh.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportMcLarenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Down a set and a break against a cunning opponent, the British No 1 had been junkballed into oblivion and defeat drew near. Her recent difficult form and her lack of confidence in the surface beneath her feet was plain for ll to see.From that uncomfortable position, Boulter showed her mental fortitude in full as she emerged with a strong 1-6, 6-3, 6-1 win over Tatjana Maria to clinch a 2-1 win for Great Britain over Germany in their opening tie of theBillie Jean King Cupqualifiers in the Hague.Alex de Minaur records first ‘double bagel’ with whitewash of Grigor DimitrovRead moreEarlier on Friday, Sonay Kartal produced an impressive 6-4, 6-2 win over the world No 120 Jule Niemeier on her BJK Cup debut. The tie concluded with a 6-4, 6-1 win for Laura Siegemund and Anna-Lena Friedsam over Harriet Dart and Olivia Nicholls in the doubles rubber.Great Britain will now face the Netherlands on Saturday in a match that will determine the group winner and participant in the BJK Cup Finals, which take place in Shenzhen, China in September. The Netherlands defeated Germany 3-0 on Thursday.The BJK Cup remains an event in flux after the ITF opted to align the tournament with the Davis Cup by reducing the number of teams in its Finals tournament from 12 to eight. As the event shifts to its new format, the finalists will be decided in this clunky three-team group stage before reverting to traditional home and away ties next year.Despite an unsurprisingly sparse turnout at the indoor clay courts in Sportcampus Zuiderpark for the neutral tie of the week, only a couple hundred fans present, both sets of travelling fans created a solid atmosphere.The tie began with a significant breakthrough moment for the fast-improving Kartal. Now the British No 3, over the past year the 23-year-old has won her first career WTA title and has established herself as a top 100 player. She further fortified her position among the elite last month by reaching the fourth round in Indian Wells and rising to a new career high of No 60.View image in fullscreenSonay Kartal chases down the ball during her victory over Jule Niemeier.Photograph: Nathan Stirk/Getty Images for LTAIn a sport filled with tall, imposing athletes, at 5ft 4in Kartal is a diminutive competitor but she ground down an increasingly erratic Niemeier with her consistency, depth and defensive skills. Kartal also smartly chose her moments to force herself inside the baseline and impose herself with a heavy forehand. With a professional, assured performance, Kartal closed out her first BJK Cup victory.“I’m so proud to get a debut like that,” said Kartal. “In terms of how up there it is in my career, it’s probably my second biggest achievement [after winning her first match at Wimbledon]. Personally, it’s one that I’ve wanted to get ticked off for a long time.”There were ample questions surrounding Boulter, who is still finding her form after a foot injury in February and has a tough record on clay, as she entered the court.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Forced to generate her own pace on every last shot, Boulter was continually baited into overhitting and her unforced error count rose.To her credit, Boulter dug deep and she impressively found her way by closing down the net earlier and making some key volleys before ending the match with a supreme exhibition of shotmaking. From 1-6, 2-3 down, Boulter completely overpowered Maria, winning 10 of the final 11 games.“I pride myself on being a fighter and knowing that I can get myself out of those moments,” said Boulter. “I feel like that’s probably experience. There’s not many times I can count in this competition that I felt like I’ve lost a match convincingly.”Explore more on these topicsBillie Jean King CupKatie BoulterTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

But this was another cruel indication of the final steps they are still to take as a team if they are to topple Super League’s very best.There can be no doubting that Rovers have made immense strides in recent years. They are now a bona fide force and an example for many to follow on and off the field, underlined here by another sell-out inside Craven Park. But how they must be sick of the sight of Wigan – and one or two of the Super League champions’ star players to boot.NRL takeover of Super League depends on keeping French sidesRead moreEven though we are only seven rounds in, this had all the hallmarks of a statement evening for the Robins. They came into this game as the only remaining unbeaten side, and on their best start to a league season since they were last crowned champions in 1985: incidentally, the last time they won a major trophy, too.Victory here in a rematch of last year’s Grand Final, and the gap at the top between themselves and a Wigan side who won every trophy on offer last year would have been six points. Not insurmountable, but mightily significant at such an early stage in proceedings. And with 20 minutes remaining, it looked like they were on course to do exactly that.Rovers were undoubtedly the best team for the first hour. But as Wigan have reminded us in recent years, it’s not how you start, it’s how you finish. The champions went ahead for the first time with barely 10 minutes remaining as Harry Smith jinked through a tiring defence to nudge the champions ahead by two points.Then three minutes later as the hosts pushed for a try to go back in front, Bevan French – scourge of Rovers in last year’s grand final – combined with Jai Field to send the full-back racing away for the try that killed the contest. When Abbas Miski scored with seconds remaining, it merely added gloss to another Wigan victory.View image in fullscreenJake Wardle beats the Hull KR defence to score a try in the corner.Photograph: Mark Cosgrove/News Images“Hull KR had a bit of bad luck and we managed to capitalise upon it,” Wigan’s coach, Matt Peet, said. “It’s a long season and we won’t get carried away. I’m very proud.” Perhaps the Warriors were able to peak in the final moments because they had a week off during last weekend’s Challenge Cup quarter-finals, while Rovers faced local rivals Hull FC? What is certain is thatHull KRwould not use that as an excuse. “It does hurt but I’m proud of the players,” their coach, Willie Peters, said. “We were in control for long periods. But it’s fine margins against them. We’re not far off.”He is right: they are not far off. In fact, they are without question Wigan’s closest challengers again in 2025.They began superbly, taking the lead with a stunning one-handed finish from Joe Burgess and while Wigan replied through Zach Eckersley’s long-range effort, Rovers deservedly led at the break when Peta Hiku cut through to score.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Burgess thought he had scored his second but was adjudged to have knocked on, and seconds later Wigan surged up the other end and a fine team move led to Jake Wardle’s try cutting the gap to just two.It remained 12-10 in Rovers’ favour right until the final 10 minutes approached. And just when you began to wonder if they could hold on and send an emphatic message to the rest of Super League, Wigan struck like all good champions do: at exactly the right time.Smith took full advantage of a set restart, before French and Field combined to devastating effect to swing it Wigan’s way. But on this showing, you would not bet against these two meeting much later in the year again when the stakes are at their highest.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueHull KRWigan WarriorsRugby leaguematch reportsShareReuse this content"

This week, humiliated by Nigel Farage. Next week, who can tell?Fri 11 Apr 2025 07.35 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 13.53 EDTShareIt’s intriguing to watch the Conservative party treating next month’slocal electionsin England like a movie in which it has a secret cameo. Please don’t spoil the surprise for the fans! But yes – it turns out it is actually in this film. Who knew? For all of Labour’s many upsets since it came to power, it doesn’t feel as though a single one has been skilfully turned in the Tories’ favour. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is very, very bad – so bad that you can’t even be bothered to come up with anything other than a will-this-do nickname for her. Kemi Very Badenoch.More often than not since KVB beat Robert Jenrick in the leadership equivalent of Argentina v West Germany, she has seemed to be running the party like a performance art project you really wouldn’t want to see. Sorry – that’s obviously a tautology. We can just say “like a performance art project”. For almost six months now, Badenoch has made a huge deal of the fact that she quite deliberatelydoesn’t have any policies, instead repeatedly promising the “biggest policy renewal programme in 50 years”. Given what minuscule amount has actually emerged, I’m afraid my ears can now only rearrange that declaration into “I will come up with some policies in about 50 years”.Instead of policies, Badenoch has bandwagons, whose drivers regard her as an unwanted ride-hitcher. She’s sort of hiding in the bike rack of the bandwagon, or possibly beneath the bandwagon, clinging on to its chassis. Eventually, her presence becomes detected, and those pushing for new or different grooming gang inquiries note she’s suddenly noisily on board. Which is odd, considering that Rishi Sunak’s government could only be arsed to implementonly a very fewof the last inquiry’s recommendations – and that the role of women and equalities minister in that government was held by one Kemi Badenoch.But leaving aside her policy (singular?) for a while, this week Very Badenoch could be found on the airwaves declaring that the Tories were open to making deals with Reform UK on local councils. “I have categorically said that I’m not doing deals with Reform,”she said, going on to effectively list several examples of ways the Tories could do deals with Reform at local level. What has brought on this logical collapse? According to Kemi: “When someone says they want to destroy you, you don’t invite them into your house and ask to do a deal.” But also you sometimes do, because: “You don’t get to have a rerun of an election at a local level.” Do you get to have reruns of elections at a national level? If not, what is she on about? AGAIN?View image in fullscreenNigel Farage on the local election campaign trail in Ripley, Derbyshire, 10 April 2025.Photograph: Jacob King/PAThis is a rhetorical inquiry that appeared to be shared by Nigel Farage, who lost no time in playing a similar hand rather better. Farage won’t do a deal, until he will, but unlike Badenoch he did remember that what you’re supposed to do when asked these types of questions is explain why the other lot would be an absolutelyterrible choiceto vote for.But look, Badenoch has other idiosyncratic ways of rallying her troops, launching her party’s local elections campaign on Thursday by explaining to members that if you map the 2024 general election results on to the local council seats being contested, “we lose almost every single one”. Thanks for dialling in, Braveheart. Thus far, the sole point Kemi seems to have taken in the campaign is down to BBC Breakfast’s ludicrous decision to try to shame her fornot having watched Adolescence– a crime that is fast becoming on a par with not having cried in the street when Princess Di died. That said, back in real life, we can scientifically estimate that her Adolescence retort is worth about a 0.0001% swing in Broxtowe.I’ve quit the Tory party because it’s become a Trumpesque mess. Others will follow | Jamie GreeneRead moreAlas, away from her safe space – minor culture-war skirmishes and posting on X – Badenoch tends to come off as incredibly poorly prepared, given to relying on a set of about four assumptions in the absence of that preparation, and consequently can only be regarded as terminally out of her depth.This may well be the conclusion of various donors, with a Times story on Thursday ascribing adrop in donationsto the Conservatives to concerns over her leadership. It certainly features some eye-catching quotes from big donors. “It’s a bit like a new Tesla,” decided one. “Do you really want to put your money in it until you see if it’s actually going to get to the end of the road?” Tesla! If there’s one stock that the Tory leader would prefer not to be equated with right now, our anonymous friend may well have alighted upon it. Even so, that flight of fancy was a lot more appealing than another big Tory donor, who confirmed the withholding of funds from the Badenoch-led iteration of the party by explaining affectlessly: “My lot are waiting for evidence that their money will actually buy influence.” I suppose it’s quite bracing to hear people talking openly about the purchase of political influence, even if they won’t put their name to it (yet).All of which suggests we might as well brace for another summer of Conservative attempts to blood-let. As the grasshopper rubs its legs, so the Tory party sharpens its axe. Really, very little is starting to suggest the onset of long balmy days like the unmistakable desire to throw open the windows, and then to throw a leader out of one.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsConservativesOpinionKemi BadenochLocal electionsNigel FarageReform UKLocal politicscommentShareReuse this content"

All the crises around the world that we’ve no time to fixJonathan FreedlandThe US president adores the attention, but while leaders struggle to mitigate the damage he causes, other emergencies are getting worseFri 11 Apr 2025 11.50 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 13.53 EDTShareWe’re all having to master a vocabulary that was once the preserve of specialists. Now everyone needs to know their tariffs from their treasuries, their levies from their yields. But there’s one more term from the realm of economics that urgently needs to enter our lexicon. Given whatDonald Trumpis doing to the world economy – and the world – we need to talk about opportunity cost.Put simply, opportunity cost is the value of opportunity lost. It’s the benefit you could have had if you had chosen a different path. For an economist, the opportunity cost of the Mars bar you bought is the Twix you didn’t.But the principle extends beyond money. It applies to time, too. The hour you spent scrolling on your phone cost you the hour you could have had walking in the park. It can apply to anything, including our energy and attention.Enter Trump. For weeks, the resources of governments and businesses around the world have been focused squarely on the White House and its whipsawing, on-again-off-again series of tariffs imposed on enemies and friends alike.Last week, it was Trump asgameshow hostin the White House Rose Garden, proudly unveiling his Price is Right table of import duties, listing each country alongside the percentage by which it was about to get whacked. He called it “liberation day”. This week, it wasthe 90-day “pause”– climbdown would be another word – for everywhere except China, which got hit with extra levies. Throughout, people inevery ministry and trading floor on the planet held their breath, along with the boardroom of every company that buys or sells overseas, as they watched to see what Trump would do next to the global economy currently held hostage in the Oval Office. With a gun to the temple of the world trading system, Trump’s every twitch has commanded humanity’s attention.And, my, how he loves it. You could see his pleasure as he told a Republican dinner on Tuesday that the world’s nations were “kissing my ass” to negotiate a deal that would spare them tariff pain. For him, the uncertainty is all part of the fun. As the Economistrightly observed, he relishes “being the focus of a planetary guessing game”. Trump used to get his dopamine hit from a mention in the gossip columns of the New York tabloids; now he’s tasted the thrill of commanding an audience in the billions and he’s hooked.But consider the price we are all paying. I don’t (only) mean those trillions of dollars wiped out at a stroke through tumbling stocks, or even the investments put on hold as businesses decide that, amid all this uncertainty, now is not the right time to open that new factory or launch that new product, thereby delaying, perhaps for ever, the jobs or wages that would have found their way to people who need them.I mean instead the opportunity cost: the action the world could be taking if it were not forced to monitor, adjust to and accommodate the whims of one man, whose ideas on economics were formed five decades ago and werewrong even then.Right now, all the capacity governments have is devoted either to saving or replacing a global trading system that was, however imperfectly, functioning. Huge intellectual and political energy is, and will be, dedicated to ensuring that national economies can survive now that that system has been upended and a previously indispensable trading partner has gone off the rails.There are already some strong ideas. Gordon Brown has called for an “economic coalition of the willing” that would mobilise the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to protect the poorest nations and coordinate action on both interest rates and credit for companies in trouble. That approach fits with thesuggestionthat the likes of Japan, Canada, South Korea and Australia join forces with Britain and the EU to form a free trade alliance minus the US.I would embrace both those developments. But just think where all that collective energy could be going if it were not having to confront a crisis started so needlessly by Trump. Those same powers would be free to act together to tackle the climate emergency, to name the most obvious example. Europe has just experienced itswarmest ever March, 1.6C hotter than pre-industrial levels, while figures released this week show that Arctic sea ice reached its lowest extent for March since satellite records began.Naturally, no one expects Donald “Drill, baby, drill” Trump to care about that, not when he actively wants to see the world burning more, not fewer, fossil fuels. But much of the rest of the world does care about the climate crisis. Of course, it would be naive to imagine that, absent Trump, they would be devoting every waking hour to reducing carbon emissions. But what little capacity the international system has for collective action has been gobbled up by a crisis that was not born of natural disaster or pandemic, but the caprice and vanity of one man.Witness the plight of Sudan. Figures are hard to come by, but a monitoring lab at Yale puts the number of dead in the civil war that has raged there since 2023 as high as150,000, with the UN accusing both sides of “harrowing” crimes, including mass rape and torture. International action is essential. Instead, say campaigners, there’s been a “loss of leadership, coordination and money”, traceable to the day Trump took office.Part of that is down to Elon Musk’s dismantling of the lead US aid agency, but part of it is other governments having their hands full managing the Trump hurricane. As Kate Ferguson of Protection Approaches told me, the gutting of USAid and “the anxiety triggered by tariffs” mean US funding to on-the-ground emergency response rooms – health clinics and the like – has collapsed, “and other states are hesitant to fill the gap”. Next week there’s a chance to put that right, as foreign ministersgather in Londonon Tuesday to discuss Sudan. But it’s hard to be hopeful. David Lammy won early plaudits for highlighting the bloodshed in Sudan, but in recent weeks, the foreign secretary’s focus has necessarily been elsewhere. You can say the same of Gaza or Ukraine, forced down the list of international priorities by a trade war that did not have to happen.This is how it is. Political bandwidth is limited. I’ve been told often that governments can handle only one crisis at a time, two at most. Now a huge chunk of that capacity has had to be diverted to dealing with something that decision-makers could previously take for granted: relations with the US and the functioning of the global trade system. Currently, both are in a state of permanent crisis. Britons have seen this movie before, when Brexit consumed several years of political and policymaking energy, and the entire apparatus of the UK state was forced to deal with an issue that never needed to arise, energy that could have gone on real problems that desperately needed solving.To repeat, Trump will lose no sleep over any of this. He likes the thought that his foes – and even his allies are foes – will be snarled up, trying to untangle knots he’s created: it’s a tactic he’s used since the 1970s, when he liked to tie up opponents in lawsuits. He loves tariffs especially, because they give him the power to exempt countries or even individual companies he favours – those who “kiss his ass” – ina system that all butinvites bribery and corruption. He loves these games. But they cost everyone else dear – until, that is, the rest of the world decides to stop playing.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump tariffsTariffscommentShareReuse this content"

Never would I have imagined that 35 years later, I would be speaking at a rally in the same square, this time urging the preservation of democracy.Back then, when I was a young social anthropology academic at our local university, activism was far from my mind. But everything changed for me in 2013 whenMarian Kotleba, leader of the neo-Nazi People’s Party Our Slovakia, was elected as regional governor. The shock was enormous. No one I knew had believed that such an outcome was possible, yet it happened. Realising the dangers this posed, many like-minded individuals knew we couldn’t stand by idly.View image in fullscreenMarian KotlebaIllustration: Guardian Design/Reuters/Getty ImagesOn the night after the election, a group of us gathered on the steps of the Museum of the Slovak National Uprising, a site symbolising resistance against Nazi Germany and its Slovak puppet state. Echoing the past, we lit candles, shed tears, sang songs and embraced. That moment marked the beginning of our discussion of how to promote democratic values actively. Our goal was not to oppose a democratically elected candidate but to cultivate democratic awareness throughout the region andSlovakia. Not to talk but to do.From this small gathering emerged an informal grassroots movement that played a crucial role in mobilising civil society against Kotleba and his extremist party. A few hundred volunteers, with no prior activism experience, were driven by the passion to defend our freedoms and ensure Slovakia never returned to its history of Nazi or communist tyranny.The struggle was long and often discouraging. In 2016,Kotleba’s party gained seats in the national parliament, emboldening his supporters. Yet in 2017, after four years of relentless effort, we succeeded in helping to oust Kotleba as regional governor. Our movement, Not in Our Town (Niot), exposed his extremist ideology through public discussions, educational programmes, protests and cultural events. We worked with journalists, academics and activists to distribute fact-based flyers detailing his mismanagement of the economy, hisracist statementsand harmful policies. We organised screenings of films likeA Hole in the Head (about the Roma Holocaust) and The White World According to Daliborek (a documentary about contemporary neo-Nazis). We also engaged schools and local organisations to educate young people about democracy, tolerance and Slovakia’s history of extremism. Our Schools for Democracy programme, a joint initiative of Niot and the Centre for Community Organising, used a method called living libraries, where individuals from various minority groups shared their life stories in classrooms.More from this seriesLoading...A critical strategy was increasing voter participation, since Kotleba’s 2013 victory resulted largely from low turnout and apathy: in the run-off that elected him,only 25% turned up to vote. Through social media campaigns, door-to-door outreach and public events, Niot encouraged citizens to vote in the 2017 elections. Our campaign Spolu je nás viac (Together We Are Stronger) directly engaged voters, explaining how abstention enabled extremism. For example, we showed how Kotleba rejectedmillions of eurosin EU funds that could have improved schools and hospitals.Most impactful, however, was talking to people face to face. This way we were able to explain Kotleba’s failures as a governor: blocking EU funds, neglecting economic growth and implementing discriminatory practicestargeting the Roma, Jews and migrants. None of these had put money in people’s pockets – in fact, Kotleba’s governorship had made life worse for many ordinary voters.

Ján Lunter, a respected businessman and credible alternative to Kotleba, emerged as the strongest challenger.Our efforts paid off. In the 2017 regional elections, Lunter won nearly 49%, while Kotleba suffered a crushing defeat with only 23%. It was a decisive moment, proving the power of grassroots activism. We were happy, but we knew this was only one battle in a longer struggle.Then, in October 2023, Robert Fico became Slovakia’s prime minister for the fourth time, adopting an increasingly anti-EU and pro-Russia stance. His governmentintroduced legal changeswidely seen as attempts to shield party affiliates from corruption investigations. Civil society mobilised once again.On 22 December 2024, Ficovisited Vladimir Putinin Moscow – without any public explanation. The next day, just before Christmas, Niot organised the first protest against Fico’s visit to Moscow and his foreign policy. Despite the holiday season, hundreds gathered in Banská Bystrica.Since then, Niot has held weekly protests and marches each Friday, featuring speeches by activists, artists and academics. We coordinate closely with movements – such as Peace for Ukraine – in other cities, maintaining a peaceful, non-violent and pro-democratic stance. Police cooperation has been excellent.Our key message since December 2024 is simple: “Slovakia is Europe. We are Europe”. Living less than 220 miles (350km)from Ukraine’s border, the prospect of Slovakia aligning with Russia is alarming. Our protests have grown,now attracting 5,000 to 10,000 weekly participants in Banská Bystrica, a town of 75,000.On 7 February 2025, more than 100,000 people took part in protests in more than 40 Slovak cities as well as in cities abroad such as Prague, Brno, London, Luxembourg, Paris, Stockholm, Copenhagen and New York.Tens of thousands in Slovakia protest against PM’s shift towards RussiaRead moreDespite threats, we refuse to be silenced. In January 2025, aTelegramchannel published the home addresses of several Niot activists, leading to increased police monitoring of local activists. Nevertheless, Niot continues to organise protests and public discussions across Slovakia to foster dialogue and engagement among diverse communities.Our organisation remains an informal grassroots platform, without a legal status. Decisions are made collectively, and our mailing list includes only about 150 citizens. The initiative’s strength is in its diversity and authenticity. And in lots of off-line, face-to-face discussions that contribute to building mutual trust. We simply follow our right to gather, express our views and act on facts.Slovakia is one of Europe’s most beautiful yet often overlooked countries. Though small in size, the Niot movement is determined to defend democracy here. It is not extremism but indifference that is the real enemy of freedom.Since the Velvet Revolution and our accession to the EU in 2004, Slovakia has flourished despite the challenges of populism. History has taught us painful lessons: we were invaded by the Nazis in 1939, fell into communist totalitarianism in 1948 and suffered Soviet occupation in 1968. Not in Our Town says, “Never again. We will not be silent.”Professor Alexandra Bitušíková is a social anthropologist at Matej Bel University in Banská Bystrica, SlovakiaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For 6 April 1990 was the day that married women became recognised by HMRC as beings – get this! – independent from their husbands, and started having their incomes taxed separately from their spouses’. Of course, many said the rot would set in and it’s true that just a few short years later rape in marriage became a crime, as people started to think that maybe wives’ bodies as well as their earnings were their own and things briefly started looking up all round.The feminist story has, gosh, had its ups and down since, but I think it’s important to remember and celebrate the wins. Otherwise, you know, you might just lie down and cry instead.TuesdayDire wolves are back, baby! And to answer your first question – no, apparently they weren’t just an invention of Game of Thrones but a real thing that became extinct 10,000 years ago. And now they are not. Sort of. The peerlessly excellently named company Colossal Biosciences Inc extracted dire wolf DNA from fossilised remains, whacked it into some grey wolf cells (stop me if I’m getting too technical) and, hey presto, three extremely muscular pups were born and are now being held at a secret 800-hectare (2,000-acre) facility in the northern US while someone, I guess, works out why they did this and what should happen next.Of course a lot of experts claiming to know better than me and the good people of Colossal Biosciences about whacking fossilised DNA into living cells are saying that they are just slightly odd wolves and the headlines are ridiculous hype. All I know is they have nothing to do with a trade war with China and do not require me to try to understand tariffs, which seem a lot more complicated than DNA, and so I say dire wolves are back, it must be dragons next and let’s go!View image in fullscreenDigested photo: ‘It’s meee, Ed Daveeeeeey, on the election trail agaaaiiiin!’Photograph: Ben Birchall/PAWednesdaySay what you like about Donald Trump but when he’s right, he’s right. Today he signed an executive order to “end the Obama-Biden war on water pressure” and “make America’s showers great again”. Apparently he has long been frustrated by the low pressure that makes it hard for him to wash his “beautiful hair”, and has always blamed it on federal water conservation standards.I am on a book tour and staying in a variety of hotels around the country, so am currently prepared to support the leader of any movement towards the standardisation of showers at all. How are there so many ways to get water out of a tube and perforated overhead thingy and so many, many ways to adjust the temperature? And why are all of them baffling, non-instinctive and indecipherable without your glasses on, which you do not have, because you were – foolishly, it turns out – hoping to have a shower?No, fair play to Trump. Global trade war or no global trade war – this is what the people want.ThursdayYou’ll never believe what I did today. Travelling from Edinburgh to London, I asked the train manager how much it cost to upgrade to first class and when I found out it was £45, I did it.It was a heady joy. Not just the new, full complement of luxuriously padded seat but the feeling of striking out into new territory, of staking a claim to country untraversed by any Mangan before her. We don’t spend money unnecessarily, you see. And by “unnecessarily” I mean “on improving, making more comfortable or slightly less painful anything that can be endured without death as the most likely outcome”. We don’t get taxis. We don’t buy clothes until the previous ones fall apart. Ditto furniture. We lead uncomfortable, aesthetically displeasing lives because it is immoral to spend money on anything that might lead to happiness.Around about Berwick, as I bit into my complimentary bacon butty, washed it down with a free coffee, stretched my legs across the copious space allocated to me and sighed with delight as the blood flowed freely through my veins again, I uncoupled myself from this thinking. From now on, it’s the sybaritic life for me.FridayEaster is nearly here, which is great, because Easter isthe best. It’s in spring, when all the green shoots, daffodils, lambs and general suffusion of the air with life and hope can bestir even the most inert spirits to rise and take interest in existence again. It’s warm but not too warm. There’s chocolate in egg form, which is simply the best and tastiest way to eat chocolate. The school holiday is long enough to allow for some actual relaxation (unlike the skid to a halt and then immediate cranking back up that is stupid, stupid half-term) but short enough not to allow boredom and desperation to take over (summer holidays, which we haven’t needed since the last school-aged child stooked his last stook on the last family farm, I’m looking at you). And it doesn’t require frantic present-buying, turkey-cooking or attendance at a fireworks display. It is a calm, manageable holiday and I thank both Jesus and our pagan forefathers for this welcome, welcome gift.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekcommentShareReuse this content"

Then he chickened outSteven GreenhouseIn a second term of fiat, flubbing and flip–flopping, Trump pursued his desire to wield a club over everyone and everythingFri 11 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 11.22 EDTShareBy imposing punitively high tariffs,Donald Trumpwas playing a high-stakes game of chicken with the US’s trading partners – but it was Trump who chickened out and suspended his tariffs just hours after they took effect. The president couldn’t ignore the worldwide economic havoc that he had caused singled-handedly – stock markets were plunging, business executives were panicking and consumers were seething.Eager to persuade manufacturers to build new plants in the US, Trump said on Monday that many of his tariffswould be permanent. But for Trump, permanent evidently meant two days.Once again, Trump showed that his second term is one of fiat, flub and flip-flop, of bluster and blunder, of shooting first and aiming later. It’s also a mix of cutting, gutting and cruelty.And foolery. Trump’s tariffs are worse than, as the Wall Street Journal put it, the “dumbest trade war in history”: they are the dumbest economic policy that any US president has ever adopted. His tariffs quickly caused vast and totally unnecessary damage to stock markets, industries and diplomatic relations across the globe. Before Trump unexpectedly suspended the tariffs, US stock markets had lostmore than $10tnin value, and stock markets overseas plummeted, too. Millions of retirees had seen their 401(k)s plunge in value, consumers were facing substantially higher prices and many workers were already losing their jobs as Trump’s tariffs sent shockwaves through the global economy.The Guardian view on the tariff war pause: the Trump trade shambles is not over | EditorialRead moreTrump’s embarrassing climbdown on tariffs was one of the rare times he bowed to common sense. If only he would do the same when it comes to his dangerously myopic cuts to scientific research, environmental protection and foreign aid.Trump has not climbed down, however, in his showdown with China. In a fit of pique over China’s retaliatory tariffs, Trump has imposedstratospheric 145% tariffs on China. Attention Walmart shoppers: that is going to more than double the price of many things you buy.When it came to tariffs, Trump made some basic political fumbles. Not only did he gogolfing and speak at a million-dollar-a-headfundraiser as this economic disaster unfolded, but he failed to give a coherent explanation for his screw-everyone-else tariffs. Trump and his team pointed to a potpourri of often-conflicting goals: to erase trade deficits, to collect trillions of dollars for the treasury, to bring back manufacturing jobs, to give Trump negotiating leverage to crack down on fentanyl and immigration and reduce other countries’ tariffs.Let’s not delude ourselves. There are two main reasons for Trump’s tariffs: first, to satisfy his never-ending thirst for vengeance against those he feels have wronged him (which seems to mean every country in the world except Russia) and second, to fulfill his desire to wield a club over everyone and everything. By using staggeringly high tariffs as a weapon, Trump has been acting like a mob enforcer, telling every business in town: I’m going to clobber you with my baseball bat unless you do what I want.There’s another reason for Trump’s tariffs: his ignorance about how the world’s economy works. Trump’s “liberation day” speech on tariffs gave the looney, but unmistakable, impression that he believes that Vietnam, for instance, is looting and pillaging the US by selling more sneakers and other goods to the US than the US sells to Vietnam. Trump thinks this even though millions of Americans are delighted to buy well-made sneakers from Vietnam (which would cost consumers far more if they were made in the US).With his grievance-driven, zero-sum worldview, Trump no doubt believes that other countries are unfairly taking advantage of the US whenever we trade with them – and he wants to get even.With the nation’s low 4% unemployment rate, it will be hard to find workers to do the manufacturing jobs that Trump wants to bring backTrump thinks that trade deficits are evil. If Trump had taken a class with Robert Solow, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at MIT, he might have heard Solow’s wisdom about why there’s no big worry about bilateral trade deficits: “I have a chronic deficit with my barber, who doesn’t buy a darned thing from me.”That Trump got to impose his calamitous tariffs at 12.01am on Wednesday reflects the dismal quality of his cabinet and advisers. Too many are lackeys who automatically cheer whatever he does, while some others, like the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, no doubt realized that his tariffs were dumb and disastrous, but they’re too cowardly to tell the Tariff King. The tariffs would inevitably increase inflation and probably push the US into recession. Even though Republicans have vowed never to raise taxes, Trump’s tariffs are unarguably a tax, a regressive tax andthe largest tax increase in 60 years. Trump’s tariffs were bound to destroy smoothly running supply chains and hurt untold numbers of US companies. They were also a disaster for relations with our allies. They were already triggering massive retaliation.If Trump had some smart, principled advisers, they might explain to him that many obstacles might prevent his tariffs from achieving their goals. With the nation’s low 4% unemployment rate, it will be hard to find workers to do the manufacturing jobs that Trump wants to bring back, especially when he’s rounding up and expelling many immigrant workers. Moreover, US corporations have largely lost the technological knowhow to compete in various industries and that complicates hopes to bring back far more factories.Then there’s another big problem – the chaotic Trump is the worst possible president to persuade companies to build factories in the US to produce goods they now obtain from abroad. King Donald the Capricious does not exactly exude the air of stability that executives insist on before they decide to make big investment decisions, like building new factories.Trump trumpeted his tariffs in part to show strength, but he ended up in an embarrassing retreat (he did maintain a 10% tariff on many countries). Trump is eager to get China to heed his wishes, but China, the world’s leading manufacturing country, can now see that Trump will back down when the heat is too great.China doesn’t have clean hands on trade. It improperly subsidizes many industries to help them outcompete manufacturers in the US and elsewhere. China also has ambitions to vastly increase its manufacturing capacity – a strategy that could kill off important industries in the US, Canada, Europe, Japan and other countries. If Trump were smart and strategic, he – instead of alienating those countries with his tariffs – would have formed an alliance with those countries to pressure China. But now those countries are too angry at the Trump to do that.Trump, never one to admit defeat, insists that his climbdown was a victory, that the mess he made was marvelous strategy. He says many countries are eager to make deals with him. “I’m telling you, these countries are calling us up,kissing my ass,” he said on Wednesday. “They are dying to make a deal.”Our allies are no doubt furious with Trump. Not only were they already angry that he stabbed Ukraine in the back and sidled up to Putin, but they’re unhappy that his tariff foolishness violated numerous international agreements and sought to blow up a smoothly running trade system. And then Trump ridicules them by saying they were rushing to kiss his behind.I hardly ever agree with Elon Musk, but he was right that Trump’s tariffswere the work of moronswho were “dumber than a sack of bricks”.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issues.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionDonald TrumpTariffsTrump administrationUS economyUS foreign policyUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It was thedifferencebetween the 20% levy imposed on all continental exports and the 10% baseline figure payable on British goods.Sadly for the Brexiters, the gap closed a week later when Mr Trump aborted his plans. What the tariff schedules will look like at the end of the 90-day “pause” is no more predictable than any other feature of current US policy. There is no obvious concession from the UK government that might induce the White House to lower its 25% barrier against car exports, and the 10% rate on everything else looksnon-negotiable.Meanwhile, talks with the EU about closer cooperation continue apace. The government hopes to have a framework agreement in place in time for a summit in London on 19 May. The primary focus is security, but that is intended to be a precursor to closer trade cooperation.As an indication of accelerating rapprochement, Rachel Reeves attended a meeting of EU finance ministers inWarsaw on Friday. The chancellor supports plans for a pan-European defence procurement fund and wants Britain to be included. There are hurdles still to be overcome but also strong will on both sides to make it happen, which is a measure of how much more constructive diplomacy has become under Labour. No Tory chancellor would have sought such a dialogue.Regime change in Westminster made a closer EU-UK relationship possible, then Mr Trump’s rampage of destruction through the norms of transatlantic security and global trade made it urgent.Recognition of a mutual strategic interest and a more constructive disposition are necessary, but not sufficient conditions for a deal. The Brexit withdrawal treaty and subsequent trade and cooperation agreement were deliberately shaped by Boris Johnson’s government to impede reintegration on any level. Irreversible divergence was the whole point. There is not a great appetite in Brussels to revisit terms of divorce that damaged British businesses and interests more than the EU. The goodwill earned by Sir Keir Starmer’s diplomatic advances has been hampered by his insistence on operating withinred linesdrawn by domestic electoral imperative more than any long-term economic rationale.European leaders understand that democratic politicians must defer to public opinion. But the prime minister’s reluctance ever to challenge the fallacious premises of Brexit, even after winning a landslide victory last year, raises doubts about the true scale of his ambition when it comes to the EU reset. That misgiving is boosted whenever British ministers talk enthusiastically about their dealings with Mr Trump, who doesn’t hide hishostility to the European project. Sir Keir insists it is not a binary choice, but it will become one as soon as concessions to the White House threaten to destroy trust in Brussels or further impede access to the single market.The claim that Britain can be equidistant between Europe and the US may feel like keeping options open in Downing Street, but in Brussels it looks like a reversion to typical British Eurosceptic ambivalence, which bleeds trust from the negotiations. The prime minister faces a stark strategic dilemma, and his options get worse the longer he defers the choice.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now his prints are everywhere. He would be thrilled and appalledFri 11 Apr 2025 12.11 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 13.53 EDTShareThe great 19th-century designerWilliam Morriswasn’t thinking of a £2 floral iPhone cover when he wrote “Tomorrow, the civilised world shall have a new art, a glorious art, made by the people and for the people.” In his lifetime he failed in his dream of making art for all, while paying his workers fairly. Only the homes of the wealthy were decorated by Morris & Co. As he feared, he had simply been “ministering to the swinish luxury of the rich”.But today his designs can be found everywhere, from John Lewis to Chinese online marketplace Temu. His Strawberry Thief print is the most popular item in the V&A museum shop, and the internet is awash with AI-generated posters for fake William Morris V&A exhibitions. A new show,Morris Mania, at the William Morris Gallery in Walthamstow, explores how his botanical prints went viral, with a callout to the public to loan their own Morris ephemera.Morris would be thrilled and appalled at this democratisation of his work. His legacy, like his life, is one of contradictions: he was a radical socialist and hugely successful businessman, who made wallpaper for Queen Victoria;a passionate champion of craftsmanshipandworkers’ rights, whose designs have become a template for mass-produced tat.Anearly environmentalist, he raged against the waste and pollution of the industrial age. His 1890 utopian sci-fi novelNews from Nowhereimagined a future in which there is no money, private ­property or big cities. In the end, he thought only upending the whole capitalist shebang would do. But Morris’s ideals survived into the next century, influencing political thinking about the arts. Labour’s Clement Attlee, Aneurin Bevan and Tony Blair were all fans. The ethos behindthe Design Council, which celebrates its 80th anniversary this month, was not just to help rebuild the economy after the second world war but to improve people’s everyday lives. Shops like Habitat and designers such as Terence Conran took up Morris’s challenge to bring good design to the high street. In the return to “Victorian values” of the Conservative 1980s, Laura Ashley filled homes with Morris-inspired soft furnishings. Even British nuclear submarines wereupholsteredin his rose-print linen (Morris would not have approved).Now we are having another Morris moment. Perhaps the joyful expression of nature in his patterns is the key to their enduring appeal. His motto, “Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful”, may have struck a chord in lockdown. Gen Z turned tocrafting,and “cottagecore” took off. For many, our homes are also our offices; we want them to be “beautiful”.Morris has always been design’s visionary and conscience. Today, we need him more than ever. As Morris mania proves, designers – however unwittingly – have played no small part in fuelling overconsumption. They have the power to shape our world and future.Eighty per cent of the environmental impactof any new product is determined at the design stage. Good design is no longer just about form and function. Designers are responding to the climate emergency with innovations that are aesthetic and sustainable.As globalisation itself is under scrutiny thanks to US tariffs, Morris reminds us to think about where goods come from and how they were made.

Having been brought up to enjoy debate and argument, a good old “ding dong at dinner parties” was always fun. It wasn’t, however, lost on me that it could lead to frayed friendships, even if, in most circumstances, bridges were rebuilt. At work, winning the argument and driving change was all – regardless of the cost.More problematically though, as a “good parent”, who wanted to impart the skill of debate, ensure knowledge of the facts and set clear boundaries for my son, especially as he moved into his teens, I found myself easily triggered to defend a position or argue a point – calmly – thinking that I was helping in some way. Actually, I was driving a bigger and bigger wedge between us, to the point where we had a truly awful to non-existent relationship.It wasn’t until I went on some excellent Gandhi- and Martin Luther King-inspired non‑violent resistance sessions for parents and rediscovered the skill of disagreeing agreeably and “striking while the iron is cold” (letting it go until a calm discussion can be held) that the dynamics between us massively started to improve. We are now back at the point where every time we meet, we hug, we can hold good and calm conversations, and we feel like a good father and son. I have stopped trying to imagine him as the person I wanted him to be, and just enjoy him as the young man he has become.Name and address suppliedEver since retiring last year at the age of 84, I have – in a bid to stay in touch with community affairs in the small town of Ellon in deepest rural Aberdeenshire – been keeping a daily record of all the people I meet and chat to. Basic greetings of “hello” don’t count. To date, I have averaged 15 hits per day, barring Sundays when I tend not to go out.Although I am reasonably active in the town, participating in a number of activities, this simple, daily communication has proved to be rewarding and informative, giving me, as a former journalist, the perspective hinted at by Simon Usborne. I would recommend it to others of my vintage.Jack NixonEllon,AberdeenshireLike many over the last decade or so I have developed a more polarised worldview: you’re pro‑Brexit or not; pro-environment or not; pro-immigration or not; pro‑cycling or not. I recently completed jury service and had expected my fellow jurors to be equally tribal, and to have to have some difficult conversations, but found almost everyone to be sensible, balanced, sympathetic and keen to get on with their fellow man and wider society. Mainstream and social media, by the design of those wielding power, has led us to develop a worldview focused on the extremes and, as Simon Usborne highlights, discussions related to these topics never end well. We are not so divided and need to focus more on the middle to build a broader society that works for everyone.Tom LavenderWhitley Bay, Tyne and WearI read with interest and empathy Simon Usborne’s article,which proposes an attractive zen approach to political squabbles at the dinner table. While I agree that avoiding hot topics that will turn a pleasant evening at home into a tension-filled battlefield is helpful to one’s quality of life and maintaining family ties and a measure of sanity, there is a philosophical issue that goes unmentioned: when does someone’s siding with the morally despicable make them unlovable? And, in that case, what are we preserving by maintaining a relationship with them?Here in the US, lines are sharply drawn between Maga Republicans and anyone who believes in a kinder, less armed, more diverse, fair, equitable and just society. As we teeter on the brink of true fascism, intimate relationships with those whose values lie with the perpetrators of hateful politics can feel like a form of self-abuse. How much can we depend on or trust those to whom we cannot speak our heart? Can we trust that they would fight for us if we were detained or disappeared for opposing the president? There are practical considerations, not just moral or emotional ones, that must be considered.DP SnyderHillsborough, North Carolina, USI fully agree with Simon Usborne’s article and applaud his efforts. I have lived with non-confrontational tactics for a long time. I am the eldest of four children, and as adults we had our parents with us until fairly recently. They were both alive and pro-Trump for the first presidency term. So were my three younger siblings.Needless to say, with this last election, and the fact that we had recently spent a great deal of time together caring for my parents, I listened to a lot of short-sighted discussions in favour of Trump.Once I finally made my politics known, it was too late to change the outcome of the election. I had tried my level best to present them with other logical possible outcomes than the ones presented by the winning party, and evidence of past duplicity and actions versus speeches by same. But, after an embarrassing crying jag online with them, we just don’t discuss politics.Certainly, things may change rapidly with the most recent developments in the headlines, but until something personally financially drastic happens, it will be passed by as “Disturbing news, right?” Then it will be “Why is this happening?” with lots of hand‑wringing for them, and tongue-biting for me.Michaline MorrisonNooksack, Washington, USI agree with Simon Usborne to the extent that arguing with someone about a powerful emotional issue is fruitless in that the likelihood of changing their mind is close to zero. However, if a close friend or family member displays values that are not yours, it affects the closeness one is able to have with that person. After all, deep connection doesn’t endure with people whose core values are antithetical to one’s own.Usborne writes: “I try to look for common ground, rather than the battleground, and try harder to understand where people are coming from along the way. At the risk of sounding virtuous, it feels good.” For me, that’s a cop out. As Elie Wiesel famously stated: “We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.” It’s not about understanding where the people are coming from. There is no room for “understanding” values you deem abhorrent.Paul HoffmanEast Greenwich, Rhode Island, USHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

There is little that clinicians can do about the political context, yet some of the personal injustices that patients have experienced do have a direct impact on their condition.I have been an NHS psychiatrist for 50 years and have witnessed the increasing dominance of disease classification among my colleagues. Once we know what the patient has “got”, the less interest there is in how they reached this point. As things stand, even with far greater numbers of specialists, our model of care would not be fit for purpose.(Does the UK have a mental health overdiagnosis problem?, 5 April). We have a problem with overdependence on diagnosis.The case of schizophrenia – the archetype of 20th-century psychiatry – is instructive. One of our foremost clinical scientists, Prof Sir Robin Murray,said: “In the last two decades, it has become obvious that child abuse, urbanisation, migration, and adverse life events contribute to the etiology of schizophrenia and other psychoses”, adding that “my preconceptions had made me blind to the influence of the social environment”. This courageous confession exposes the tip of an iceberg of indifference to the developmental origins of mental disorder, which has impoverished the curiosity and imagination of the besieged workforce that so many are waiting to meet.Dr Sebastian KraemerTavistock and Portman NHStrustIt was a privilege to work with the lateProf David Goldbergon his project about common mental illnesses for the WHO. In general, across places and languages, the same common conditions came up (an exception was depression, where the diagnostic questions used then were offensive, in Chinese). The prevalence of problematic anxiety, depression and alcohol use varied a lot, even in one country. Residents in “depressed” (disadvantaged) communities were more often depressed and anxious, and likely to drink until they were “disabled”. Questioning clients at a job centre not only found many had mental disorders but had struggled since their teens.How much the UK spends on benefits is a matter of policy. But it is clear that the government is failing to ask whyrates of common mental disorder have increased so “steeply”. Keir Starmer is overseeing conditions that are making more and more people ill. The young are most vulnerable. The postwar Attlee government had little money, but it shared a vision of reconstruction. When do we all start, Sir Keir?Woody CaanFormer editor, Journal of Public Mental HealthYour article on mental health and disability benefits is apposite but asks the wrong questions. Wes Streeting asserts that society cannot afford a disability benefit bill of £48bn per annum, so the correct questions revolve around what support is required to achieve full employment, including those in prison and those with interacting physical and mental health problems. To not work is bad for one’s health.The medical sociologists quoted in your article are closer to the solution than health professionals, who seem unable to determine what a mental disorder is, let alone agree overdiagnosis v underdiagnosis. The answer lies in whole-scale exercise, be it walking, yoga, or passive exercise in the gym. Social prescribing benefits all mental and physical conditions, including depression. If you can exercise, you can work.The correct questions revolve around: how can workplaces predicated on global capitalism be induced to profitably employ and support a much wider range of employees, including people with mental illness? Employment practices in Denmark, the “well man” of Europe, suggest that this is possible through political change.Jeremy SeymourRetired psychiatrist, SheffieldHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This is intended to encourage them to adapt their ships to use low-CO2fuels and to operate more efficiently, for instance by slowing down and thereby using less fuel, instead of the current wasteful practice of rushing to ports then idling nearby.The measure is forecast to raise about $10bn (£7.6bn) a year, which is much lower than the $60bn a year that had been hoped for from a straightforward carbon levy. The revenues are also likely to be used within the shipping industry to help introduce cleaner technologies, rather than being diverted to vulnerable countries suffering the effects of extreme weather, as a levy would have been.The emissions reductions likely to be achieved will also be modest, at least in the early years: about 8% by 2030, according to estimates from Umas, a commercial shipping consultancy. That falls far below the 20% reduction required by the IMO’s climate strategy set out in 2023.Emma Fenton, a senior director at the campaign group Opportunity Green, said: “The IMO has made a historic decision, yet ultimately one that fails climate-vulnerable countries and falls short of both the ambition the climate crisis demands, and that member states committed to just two years ago.”While shipowners might be tempted to opt for liquified natural gas as a cleaner alternative to the heavy, dirty bunker fuels commonly used, the rules are expected to tighten in the 2030s to penalise LNG more heavily.Nevertheless, according to Tristan Smith, an associate professor in energy and transport at University College London, the rules could encourage the use of biofuels, which can be damaging to the environment.He said: “[This is a] massive boost for biofuels, the likely least-cost compliance option for 85% of the fleet for the first five years. [That means] tens of millions of tonnes more demand.”He said further negotiations on refining the carbon trading rules between now and their formal adoption in October would be “critical to limit the damage”.Jonas Moberg, the chief executive of the Green Hydrogen Organisation, which advocates for hydrogen, said: “The IMO’s decision today sends an important signal to green fuels companies to go forward with projects. It is now clear that near-zero emissions fuels like green ammonia [a form of hydrogen fuel] will play an ever larger role in shipping in the years ahead.”Many small island states abstained on the final vote, signalling their disappointment. Simon Kofe, the transport and energy minister for Tuvalu, said: “We came as climate-vulnerable countries with the greatest need and the clearest solution [in the form of a levy]. And what did we face? Weak alternatives from the world’s biggest economies – alternatives that won’t get us on a pathway to the 1.5C temperature limit [above pre-industrial levels]. They asked us to settle for less, while we are the ones losing the most.”They vowed to fight on for stronger measures. The rules must now be refined and could be subject to substantial alteration before they can be formally adopted at an IMO meetingin October. Albon Ishoda, the special envoy for maritime decarbonisation for the Marshall Islands, said: “We are not done. We will be back. Alongside our friends from the Caribbean, the Pacific, Africa, Central America and the UK. Still standing. Still steering.”The US, which had been present at the talks, stopped negotiating after sending a missive to other countries making clear thatDonald Trump opposed the proposed carbon levy. It is not clear whether the US will accept the carbon-trading compromise agreed, but other countries are confident they can impose the rules in any case.One developed country participant told the Guardian the compromise deal was probably the best that could have been hoped for. The EU had been strongly in favour of a levy, but before the talks began in earnest this week itchanged its position to back carbon trading instead.China, Brazil and several other emerging economies opposed the levy, but voted in favour of the carbon trading compromise.Ralph Regenvanu, the environment minister for Vanuatu, said: “Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5C [the more stringent of the temperature goals in the 2015 Paris agreement].Saudi Arabia, the US, and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn.“These countries – and others – failed to support a set of measures that would have gotten the shipping industry on to a 1.5C pathway. And they turned away a proposal for a reliable source of revenue for those of us in dire need of finance to help with climate impacts.”Explore more on these topicsShipping emissionsGreenhouse gas emissionsParis climate agreementSaudi ArabiaRussiaUnited Arab EmiratesCarbon offsettingnewsShareReuse this content"

They say this should apply to substances already in use, as well as those yet to be approved.In preliminary findings from the largest study of its kind,scientists examining household dustfrom homes in 10 European countries in 2021 detected 197 pesticides in total.More than 40% of the pesticides found in the dust have been linked to highly toxic effects, including cancer and disruption of the hormonal system in humans.The number of pesticides in each home ranged between 25 and 121, and levels of pesticides tended to be higher in the homes of farmers.Prof Paul Scheepers, of the Radboud Institute for Biological and Environmental Sciences, said: “We have many epidemiological studies showing that diseases are associated with mixtures of pesticides.”He said the pesticides in dust found their way into people’s homes via shoes, as well as cats and dogs. “If we don’t take off the shoes at the doorstep, then we take in a lot of dirt from outside. Pets are also a source,” Scheepers said.“There are many studies indicating that animals collect certain contaminations, also including pesticides, from outdoors. Another group are the consumer products that we bring into our homes … any pesticides that we buy in the shop for certain reasons, and an important source is flea and tick treatments for pets.”Though the concentrations of each pesticide in the dust were small, the mixtures of dozens of chemicals could have an impact on health, as well as increasing exposure to pesticides when they were also often encountered in higher concentrations on fruit, vegetables and flowers.The study found that DDT remained in the environment despite the pesticide having been banned in some countries in 1972.Scheepers said those authorising the use of products should take environmental persistence into account, and that even if productssuch as Pfaswere banned now, they would probably remain in the environment.Pfas are known as “forever chemicals” because they do not break down in the environment. They are used in a wide range of consumer products and industrial processes, and some have been linked to serious diseases in humans and animals, including cancers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This is a fresh blow to green energy developers in the US, still reeling from the Trump administration’svow to roll back the Biden era’s green incentives.Leslie Abrahams, a deputy director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington DC, said the tariffs would probably hinder the rollout of clean energy in the US and push the country to the margins of the global market.‘Oligarchy’: Trump exempts big oil donors from tariffs packageRead moreSpecifically, they are expected to drive up the price of developing clean power, because to date the US has been heavily reliant on importing clean power technologies. “And not just imports of the final goods. Even the manufacturing that we do in the United States relies on imported components,” she said.The US government’s goal to develop its manufacturing base by opening new factories could make these components available domestically, but it is likely to take time. It will also come at considerable cost, because the materials typically imported to build these factories – cement, steel, aluminium – will be subject to tariffs too, Abrahams said.“At the same time there are broader,global economic implicationsthat might make it difficult to access inexpensive capital to build,” she added. Investors who had previously shown an interest in the US under the green-friendly Biden administration are likely to balk at the aggressively anti-green messages from the White House.Abrahams said this would mean a weaker appetite for investment in rolling out green projects across the US, and in the research and development of early-stage clean technologies of the future. This is likely to have long-term implications for the US position in the global green energy market, meaning it will “cede some of our potential market share abroad”, Abrahams added.Instead, countries likeChinaare likely to divert sales of their clean energy tech away from the US to other countries eager to develop green energy, Abrahams said. “So on the one hand, that should help to accelerate adoption of clean energy in those countries, which is good for emissions, but for the US, that is future market share that we’re ceding,” she said.‘Clean energy is unstoppable, with or without Trump’It’s important to distinguish between the US and the rest of the world, according to Kingsmill Bond, a strategist for the energy thinktank Ember.“The more the US cuts itself off from the rest of the world, the more the rest of the world will get on with things and the US will be left behind. This is a tragedy for the clean energy industry in the US, but for everyone else there are opportunities,” he said.Analysis by the climate campaign group 350.org has found that despite rising costs and falling green investment in the US, Trump’s trade war will not affect the energy transition and renewables trade globally.It said the US was already “merely a footnote, not a global player” in the race to end the use of fossil fuels. Only 4% of China’s clean tech exports go to the US, it said, in a trade sector where sales volume grew by about 30% last year.“Trump’s tariffs won’t slow the global energy transition – they’ll only hurt ordinary people, particularly Americans,” said Andreas Sieber, an associate director at 350.org. “The transition to renewables is unstoppable, with or without him. His latest move does little to impact the booming clean energy market but will isolate the US and drive up costs for American consumers.”View image in fullscreenPeople work on a production line for wind turbine blades in Jilin province, north-east China.Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/ShutterstockOne senior executive at a big European renewable energy company said developers were likely to press on with existing US projects but in future would probablyinvest in other markets.“So we won’t be doing less, we’ll just be going somewhere else,” said the executive, who asked not to be named. “There is no shortage of demand for clean energy projects globally, so we’re not scaling back our ambitions. And excluding the US could make stretched supply chains easier to manage.”Countries likely to benefit from the fresh attention of renewable energy investors include burgeoning markets in south-east Asia, where fossil fuel reliance remains high and demand for energy is rocketing. Australia and Brazil have also emerged as countries that stand to gain.“In times like these, countries will be increasingly on the hunt for domestic solutions,” Bond said. “And that means clean energy and local supply chains. There are always climate reasons to go green, but there are national security reasons now too.”The challenge for governments hoping to seize the opportunity provided by the US green retreat will be to assure rattled investors that they offer a safe place to invest in the climate agenda.Dhara Vyas, the chief executive ofEnergyUK, the UK industry’s trade body, said: “Certainty has always been the thing that investors say they need. The UK is seen as a stable country with a stable government, but now more than ever we need to double down on giving certainty to investors.”“Investors do like certainty,” Bond agreed. “But they also like growth and opportunity, so that’s why there is some confidence that they will continue to deploy capital in the sector.”‘The US still matters’Although the green investment slowdown may be largely limited to the US, this still poses concerns for global climate progress, according to Marina Domingues, the head of new energies for the consultancy Rystad Energy.“The US is a huge emitter country. So everything the US does still really matters to the global energy transition and how we account for CO2,” she said. The US is the second most polluting country in the world, behind China, which produces almost three times its carbon emissions. But the US’s green retreat comes at a time when the country was planning to substantially increase its domestic energy demand.After years of relatively steady energy demand, Rystad predicts a 10% growth in US electricity consumption from a boom in AI datacentres alone. The economy is also likely to require more energy to power an increase in domestic manufacturing as imports from China dwindle.In the absence of a growing energy industry, this is likely to come from fossil fuels, meaning growing climate emissions. The US is expected to make use of its abundance of shale gas, but it is planning to use more coal in the future too.In the same week that Trump set out his tariffs, he signed four executive orders aimed at preventing the US from phasing out coal, in what climate campaigners at 350.org described as an “abuse of power”.Anne Jellema, the group’s executive director, said: “President Trump’s latest attempt to force-feed coal to the US is a dangerous fantasy that endangers our health, our economy and our future.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisEnergy industryGreen economyEnergyEnergy efficiencyOil (Business)Oil and gas companiesanalysisShareReuse this content"

Within the services sector, computer programming, telecoms and car dealerships all had strong months.Sectors growth graphicHowever, the turnaround in the economy may not last. This month, consumers have been hit byinflation-busting utility bill and council tax increases, while employers must cope with £25bn of tax rises.Simon Pittaway, an economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the surprise turnaround in fortunes was unlikely to continue into the spring and summer. “It is questionable whether this momentum will last, however, as Britain moves into an era of higher tariffs, and higher economic uncertainty,” he said.The ONS figures indicated that consumers were more confident about spending despite many surveys that showed households were feeling the weight from shop price inflation over the previous three years.Services expanded 0.3% on the previous month and consumer-facing services output rose for the fourth month in a row, by 0.7% month on month.CapitalEconomicssaid it was possible the manufacturing sector had benefited from “tariff frontrunning” as companies in the US built up inventories to beat higher import costs.Industrial production rebounded by 1.5% month on month after a fall in January of 0.5%. A rise of 2.2% in manufacturing from January was driven by a 2.1% increase in metals output, a 1.8% increase in transport equipment and a 4.4% rise in pharmaceuticals output.Reflecting the boom in air travel as households used their disposable incomes to go on holiday, travel agents and tour operators experienced an 8.1% increase in income in the three months to February on the previous three-month period.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That helps drive up investment, which drives up employment, drives up growth, and that is good news, of course. There is still a very long way to go.”Reeves said the government was aware that impending tariff increases on goods exports to the US would be a heavy burden for many businesses. The chancellor said: “This government will remain pragmatic and cool-headed as we seek to secure the best deal with the United States that is in our national interest. At the same time we will be relentless in our work to kickstart economic growth, provide security for working people and renewal for Britain.”Capital Economics said that stepping back and looking at “the big picture” showed the UK economy had grown in only four of the last nine months and that it was hard to see it “strengthening much from here”.Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said: “Since coming to office, Labour’s choices have killed growth stone-dead and there is still a long way to go to recover.“At the emergency budget, the forecasts for growth, inflation and borrowing all moved in the wrong direction because of Labour’s decisions.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsRachel ReevesOffice for National StatisticsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

His ennoblement opens the door to a potential return to Conservative politics in the future.Others given seats in the House of Lords includeMark Harper, the former transport secretary, and Simon Hart, the former chief whip.Hart sent shockwaves through Westminster earlier this yearwith the publication of his memoirs, which lifted the lid on the sexual misadventures of Tory MPs and infighting during the Johnson and Sunak governments.The list includes Alister Jack, the former Scotland secretary who admittedplacing three bets on the date of the 2024 general election, and Eleanor Shawcross, who was head of theNo 10 policy unit under Sunak.Shawcross is the daughter of Sir William Shawcross, the commissioner for public appointments, and is married toSimon Wolfson, the chief executive of Next, who is also a Conservative peer.The former attorney generalVictoria Prentisand former chief executive of the Conservative party Stephen Massey will also receive peerages.Several other former Conservative cabinet ministers have been given knighthoods. They includeJeremy Hunt, who was chancellor in Sunak’s cabinet, andJames Cleverly, who served as foreign secretary and home secretary and ran for the Tory leadership last year.Grant Shapps, the former transport and defence secretary, and Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor and former work and pensions secretary, were also given knighthoods. Theresa Villiers, the former environment secretary, was given a damehood.Daisy Cooper, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, dismissed Sunak’s nominations as “an ID parade of political flunkies whose fingerprint of failure are still felt on family finances”.“They are rewards for the failure of a dreadful Conservative government that was rightly kicked out of office,” she said. “The fact that Rishi Sunak has dished out honours to his mates after all the damage they did is yet more proof of how out of touch theConservativesstill are.”Darren Hughes, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said Sunak’s list meant that the last three Conservative prime ministers “shovelled over 140 new peers in total into the House of Lords”.“The public is again witnessing the spectacle of a former prime minister stuffing even more friends and allies into the already ludicrously bloated House of Lords – handing each one a job for life in Parliament,” Hughes said. “At over 800 members, the Lords is already the second largest legislative chamber in the world after China’s National People’s Congress.”The former England cricketerJimmy Anderson, who retired from international cricket in July having taken more wickets than any fast bowler in Test history, and the film-maker Matthew Vaughn, a longstanding Conservative supporter, were also on the list of knighthoods.More than a dozen former aides to Sunak in Downing Street were given lower-ranking honours, including Nerissa Chesterfield, who worked as No 10’s director of communications, Will Tanner and Rupert Yorke, who were deputy chiefs of staff, Lucy Noakes, who was press secretary and Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, who was director of strategy.A handful of Sunak’s political allies, including his former chief of staff Liam Booth-Smith and former deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden,received honours when parliament was dissolvedfor the general election last summer.Gove, who ran for the Tory leadership in 2016, was an education secretary, environment secretary and housing secretary, but never held a great office of state.He was a central character in the Tory drama that consumed the final days of Boris Johnson’s government. In one of his last acts as prime minister in July 2022,Johnson sacked Govein what was seen as an act of revenge forderailing his 2016 leadership campaign.Explore more on these topicsRishi SunakConservativesMichael GoveJimmy AndersonJeremy HuntJames CleverlyBoris JohnsonnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not really just a humanist issue, it’s an issue of fair treatment for everyone.”Humanism, a non-religious worldview that emphasises human agency, is not recognised under marriage laws, meaning couples having a humanist celebrant must also have a civil registration service.In 2020, the high court ruled the lack of legal recognition for humanist marriage in England andWales“gave rise to discrimination”, with Mrs Justice Eady saying the then justice secretary, Robert Buckland, “cannot simply sit on his hands”.Humanist marriages are legal in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and elsewhere in the world including New Zealand, Canada and Australia. In Scotland in 2022 there were 9,140 humanist wedding ceremonies compared with 8,072 based on faiths or other beliefs.“It just feels like it has been fobbed off,” O’Sullivan said. “It makes no sense that it’s perfectly fine in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but it’s just not here. There’s nothing really outlandish or bizarre about our views, they’re pretty common.”Berrill, 42, said he “started secondary school as a Catholic and left it as an atheist”, before discovering humanism 15 years ago.“It’s important for someone to represent the views and the rights of the non-religious, to stand up for us and make sure we’ve got the same representation and are afforded the same opportunities,” he said.Shasha, who is a humanist funeral and wedding celebrant, co-runs a humanist group in Leicester with Booth, her partner of 11 years.“I think sometimes people can assume that [humanism] is a vague ephemeral thing,” Booth said.“We run a community group much like many religious people do …. So being able to have the humanist philosophy as part of our wedding would be a really lovely thing for us. It’s an equalities issue.”The government is expected to announce plans this year for an overhaul of marriage laws, which could allow weddings to take place at a variety of venues, based on recommendations from the Law Commission.Stephen Fry and Sandi Toksvig lead call for recognition of humanist marriagesRead moreHumanists are concerned a major shake-up would take years to implement, and are calling on the government to move quicker to legalise humanist ceremonies.Andrew Copson, the chief executive of Humanists UK, which is supporting the action, said: “Since 2013, every leader of theLabourparty has said they supported legal humanist marriage and every Labour frontbench spokesperson has urged the government to act without delay.“But today the same bad arguments that Labour comprehensively debunked from the opposition benches are made by Labour ministers without a blush. I can completely understand the frustration of these couples.”He said expensive legal action was “nobody’s first resort” and that “humanist marriage could be made legal within weeks at no cost and with no detriment to anyone, if the government chose to do so”.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said:“It is right the government takes the time to consider this important issue, including the Law Commission’s 2022 report, and will set out its position in due course.”Explore more on these topicsHuman rightsMarriageLabourFamilyEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Dr Davenport had previously pleaded guilty to his manslaughter.Handing her a two-year suspended prison sentence, Judge Linden said he recognised Davenport’s “sole motivation was to bring your father’s suffering to an end” and that she had “acted because his death was close”.The sentencing comes as assisted dying legislation moves through parliament. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) bill is designed to allow individuals with a terminal illness and six months or less to live to request and be provided with assistance to end their own life, subject to safeguards and protections.John Price KC, prosecuting, said that staff at Davenport’s retirement complex and a doctor did not suspect foul play because his death was expected to be imminent.Price said: “When the doctor certified his death at 10pm on 17 October it was believed to be due to natural causes. But that was not so. Mr Davenport had been in fact unlawfully killed by his daughter: this defendant, Lisa Davenport.“At about 7pm she had smothered her father with a pillow as he lay in his bed.”Price said Davenport had confessed an hour later to a neighbour and friend of her father about what she had done and asked her not to say anything.The following morning, Davenport also confessed to the manager of the retirement complex, who then reported it to the police.Price said: “Were it not for those confessions subsequently saying he had been unlawfully killed, it would have not been discovered. The evidence suggests that following his terminal diagnosis this defendant was a devoted carer of her father as his health declined.“It is accurate to say that no one could have done more for a clearly dying parent than she did.”The court heard that Davenport was in a great deal of discomfort and there were difficulties in getting his pain management under control.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She asked for him to receive more pain relief. This background might explain why a devoted daughter did what she did to her father that evening.“The prosecution has always accepted that had there been a trial, it would have been the prosecution’s case that the motivation was clearly done in a ‘belief by the offender that it was an act of mercy’.“This phrase is accurately describing her motivation for doing what she did.”Angela Pountney, to whom Davenport initially confessed, told police: “Lisa said: ‘I smothered him.’ I was shocked and could not say anything, and said: ‘Please don’t tell me.’ She said: ‘I smothered him.’ She said: ‘You must not tell anybody and the family must not know because I will be sent to prison.’”Passing sentence, Linden said: “I recognise I have taken a merciful course. I have done so because of the mitigating features of your case, which in my judgment are exceptional.”Explore more on these topicsOxfordshirenewsShareReuse this content"

It was closed by Ofsted, along with other linked premises, on 14 December 2022 after the watchdog said “children may be at risk of harm” and suspended its registration.The defendants will appear at Dudley magistrates court on Tuesday 13 May.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The MP’scode of conductstates: “Members must declare any relevant interests when speaking in the house.”View image in fullscreenSteve Yemm mentioned the firm in a Commons speech last month.Photograph: Laurie Noble/Laurie Noble PhotographyIn a statement, Yemm said: “I fully apologise for not declaring this interest prior to referencing the work of this company located in my constituency. I have made contact with the parliamentary standards commissioner and will formally correct the record at the earliest opportunity.” He said he had no personal connection with the firm.Rose Whiffen, a senior research officer forTransparency International UK, said: “When parliamentarians accept funding from private companies, they must scrupulously avoid the perception that the donor gets anything in return. MPs should ensure that everything they do in the Houses of Parliament is in the public interest. They must also declare all relevant private interests so that their decision-making is fully transparent for us all.”Yemm was first elected in July 2024, winning back Mansfield from the former Conservative MP Ben Bradley with a majority of nearly 3,500. Bradley had won Mansfield in 2017, a result that foreshadowed the Conservatives’ strong performance across the various “red wall” seats in Labour’s former industrial heartlands two years later.Yemm was selected as Labour’s candidate for Mansfield in the spring of 2023, having previously worked in a management role for a life sciences software company. He was chair of the Mansfield constituency Labour party between 2008 and 2017 and ran to be mayor in 2011.In the run-up to the general election last summer, Yemm received donations from Unison and the thinktankLabour Together. He has also received support from Unite and GMB.During the debate on construction standards on 25 March, Yemm praised work carried out by Mansfield district council to build new homes in his constituency, including through a £7.7m development scheme. He said it was important “councils and housebuilders look to British industry for solutions in construction”.Other issues he has addressed in the Commons since being elected include antisocial behaviour, apprenticeships and the war in Gaza.Explore more on these topicsHouse of CommonsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Geese are gently honking in the distance.This was once the Ferrier estate, a postwar housing estate that was demolished in 2009 to regenerate the area.Now the grey, harsh concrete has been replaced by redbrick blocks that sit in a “green corridor” linkingSutcliffe Parkin the south with the nature reserves at Kidbrooke Green and London Wildlife Trust’sBirdbrookin the north. Many of the flats overlook new ponds and the expanded wetland of the River Quaggy, which used to flood, putting local businesses and property at risk. While some planning applications elsewhere have been halted because the developers did not survey for bats or consider rare newts, this development has incorporated nature throughout, with bat boxes hanging from trees, and wetlands for newts directly next to the blocks of flats.The quality blue and green space woven between the flats includes a children’s playground and benches overlooking the wetlands. In the summer, the ponds are fringed with reeds, among which residents can spot reed buntings and kingfishers. When the Guardian visited, it was full of people enjoying a spring day.Concern for newts and bats holds back the building of new houses, according to Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves. Yet here, 5,000 new homes are being delivered alongside a paradise for newts.Wildlifetrusts have been working closely with housing developers to get good quality homes built alongside habitat for nature.View image in fullscreenThe Ferrier housing estate in Kidbrooke, Greenwich, south London, which was demolished in 2009.Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/AlamyOther wildlife trust housing sites include Trumpington Meadows in Cambridgeshire, which used to be a potato field. Now it teems with wildlife, including blue butterflies, waxcap fungi and twittering stonechats. Priest Hill, near Epsom in Surrey, has been transformed from abandoned playing fields plus some previously developed land to provide 15 new homes alongside a nature reserve, and the charmingly named Tadpole Garden Village in Wiltshire will have 28 hectares (68 acres) of green space and nearly 2,000 homes.UK charities urge ministers to stop scapegoating nature for planning failuresRead moreDavid Mooney, the chief executive of theLondonWildlife Trust, said of Kidbrooke Village: “We were initially brought in to find a nature-based solution to the flooding of the River Quaggy. We linked it to a floodplain and created sustainable urban drainage systems, and then worked with Berkeley Homes to get these flats built around the new wetlands.”The planning and infrastructure bill, which is going through parliament, strips some requirements for developers to bear nature in mind, and will make it easier for homes to be built without this green infrastructure.“The Treasury is driving this false wedge between homes and nature,” Mooney said, “but we have been working with housing developers for years and years in harmony. Some developers aren’t as conscientious as others, but the good companies want nature around the new-builds. It improves the mental health of people who live there, to have nature on their doorstep, reduces flooding, provides shade and has so many benefits.”It also saves money and maintenance to have wild spaces as they do not have to be mowed or tidied. The pretty grassland will, in summer, be a waist-high wildflower meadow.Gesturing to the meadows and ponds, he said: “They could have built on this. This wasn’t green space, it was concrete. It was a no-go zone wasteland. To some unscrupulous developers, and evidently to Rachel Reeves, this should be built on. But what does that achieve? People love being in this space.”View image in fullscreenA nature space at Kidbrooke Village.Photograph: CCullenAnd newts, evidently, do too, in the ponds of different depths and sizes. “Tell me someone that doesn’t want to have wildlife in their window, nature on their doorstep, you know, who doesn’t want to see a dragonfly buzzing past their window when they’re doing the washing up? People have a really strong affinity with the natural world, and especially when you’re established, and people live here and now take care of it, and volunteering is going on. There’s education. We’re just about to rebuild a nature pavilion.”He said the presence of bats had been incorporated into the design of the estate. “We have built boxes, and there are also ‘swift bricks’ in which birds can nest in the architecture. It can be done, easily and cheaply.”The rubble and old waste from the site has been used to create nature mounds rather than going to landfill, on which wildflower seeds will be scattered. People will be able to perch on the little hills, have a picnic and look over the ponds.Mooney said he felt wildlife trusts were mischaracterised by the government: “We aren’t saying let’s restore all of England back to nature. But there are clear maps that we can produce, and say: this is where nature can go, and therefore that’s where housing can go, rather than this wild west approach. Nature and housing can be woven together.”He said he was worried the new rules would mean developments such as Kidbrooke would remain exceptions, and more badly considered developments with no nature involved would be built instead.“There’ll be some developers who shall remain nameless, who are rubbing their hands with glee at what Rachel Reeves is saying, because they were never involved in the first place,” he said, “because they’re the greediest ones. They’re the ones that want to maximise their profit, densify everything, no consideration to the landscape, to the quality of life of the people who will actually live in the houses they are building.”Explore more on these topicsWildlifeAmphibiansConservationLondonPlanning policyHousingCommunitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This has been such a nice village. It’s been safe and it’s been left to go to rack and ruin. It’s just becoming a hellhole.”The same article quoted Mo Tariq, who lives in the village and owns a cafe, defending the hotel and its residents.“If you speak to these men, they’re all very polite. They all come from difficult situations. They are not criminals, they are not nasty people.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

James White was convicted of assaulting a security guard in August 2020 after attending a Britain First demonstration outside the hotel.Britain First stormed another hotel earmarked for removals. People barged their way into the 425-capacity Britannia Daresbury Park hotel near Warrington, Cheshire, in 2020 and filmed people from Sudan and Iraq cowering in cramped rooms.The other hotels which will no longer house migrants are the Best Western Cambridge Bar Hill hotel, which has been used to house up to 272 asylum seekers; the Icon hotel in Luton, Bedfordshire; the 78-capacity Dorchester hotel in Hull; the 80-capacity Embassy hotel in Gateshead; the EasyHotel near Hillingdon, west London; and an unnamed hotel near Kings Cross, central London.Figures obtained by the BBC showed there were 213 hotels in use during June’s general election campaign. While that number initially fell, it increased to 218 in December.The Home Office source said the removals can take place because the government is processing more asylum claims, increasing returns and rationalising the asylum estate.“We are processing applications, which had almost ground to a halt under the Tories, removing over 20,000 of those with no right to be here,” the source said.“It also means rationalising the chaotic system we inherited, utilising much cheaper accommodation options than hotels, and rationalising hotels where we have additional buffer, especially in family accommodation.”A Labour source added: “We know hotels are not the best accommodation for vulnerable children and families, so it’s right we prioritise moving them.”Nearly 7,000 asylum seekers have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel in small boats so far this year, according to the latest figures.In 2024, 36,816 were detected making the dangerous crossing.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeEnglandRaceThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

Her only child, Michal Olszewski, 52, an aeronautical engineer and dual British-Polish citizen, who lives in Lincoln with his wife, had been travelling regularly to the Polish capital to support his mother.As his mother had become increasingly frail he wanted her to move to the UK so he and his wife could care for her properly.Olszewska arrived in the UK last year on a six-month visitor visa. Shortly afterwards, an application containing the correct information was made online for her to live permanently in Britain with her son and his wife.On 25 March, the Home Office responded, informing the family: “Unfortunately your application is not valid and we are unable to accept it … The required application process for someone applying as a family member of a relevant naturalised British citizen is to use the appropriate paper form.“Your application was made online. There is no right of appeal in respect of an invalid application.”Owing to the delay in Home Office officials informing Olszewska that the wrong form had been completed, her visitor visa had expired and she had become an overstayer.The letter warned her that the consequences of staying in Britain unlawfully included being detained, fined and imprisoned, along with being removed and banned from returning to the UK.After the Guardian highlighted the case, the Home Office emailed the correct form to print and post back to them – and within days it approved the application, granting five years pre-settled status under the EU settlement scheme.A very different letter was sent by the Home Office this time, stating: ‘I am pleased to inform you …” and confirming the right to work, use the NHS and study in the UK.The case received widespread attention in the UK and inPoland. One elderly British man even offered to marry Olszewska. He said he was not looking for a relationship but wanted to make the offer as a gesture of Polish-British friendship.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ruling followed a three-and-a-half-year OfS investigation following Stock’s resignation.A legal challenge to the ruling and fine – which is 15 times larger than any previous OfS penalty, despite being reduced as it was the first case of its kind – has been launched by the university. A letter sent under the pre-action protocol for judicial review claimed the OfS “acted unlawfully, irrationally and is wrong in law”.Writing for the Higher Education Policy Institute this week, Sussex vice-chancellor, Sasha Roseneil, said the implications of the OfS finding were “wide ranging and highly corrosive of attempts to create diverse, inclusive and equal working and learning environments, and threaten university autonomy”.Stimulate debate on contentious topics, expert urges English universitiesRead moreArif Ahmed, the OfS’s director for freedom of speech and academic freedom, addressed vice-chancellors at aUniversitiesUK meeting last week. The mood among them was described as “frightened”, with the risk of fines running into millions hanging over their heads, at a time when the sector is facing severe financial difficulties.The OfS haswritten to a small number of institutionsthat have, and may be reviewing, policies where its findings on Sussex are relevant. The regulator says it wants to engage with institutions and be supportive, but it is not clear whether they will face investigation.Green condemned the fine imposed on Sussex: “Instead of taking courageous action at the time, followed by reasoned criticism of the actions of Sussex and others, the OfS has chosen to deal Sussex and all England’s higher education institutions a lesson in authoritarianism, with threats of more to come.”He said there was no need to fine Sussex. “The policy changed as soon as new vice-chancellor Sasha Roseneil started in 2022. A highly critical report of Sussex’s failures would have achieved the objectives of strengthening democratic culture and encouraging vice-chancellors and university leaders to champion freedom of speech in future.”Sir David Bell, vice-chancellor at Sunderland University, said: “We’re not overreacting as we’ve never had any free speech problems in Sunderland. We’ll take a look at our policies given the publicity around the Sussex case.“However, we don’t envisage making any changes as we’ve always had a sensible, pragmatic, tolerant and, crucially, balanced attitude here.” Another university leader said: “I hope that the matter will be expedited given the importance and potential impact on the sector.”Vivienne Stern, the chief executive of Universities UK, said: “The most important question is how measures which universities might have put in place to prevent bullying, harassment and abuse, interact with the requirements around freedom of speech.“The question we have asked the OfS is whether they are suggesting that it is always inappropriate to place restrictions on speech or material which is bullying, harassing or abusive, or only in some circumstances? And if the latter, then which circumstances?”The OfS’s final ruling on Sussex focused on a trans and non-binary equality policy statement passed in 2018 which the regulator argued had a “chilling effect” that could result in self-censorship by staff and students.An OfS spokesperson said: “Freedom of speech and academic freedom are foundational principles for higher education and the pursuit of knowledge. It’s right that we investigate where we have concerns that students may not be benefiting from the free and robust exchange of ideas, or that academics are not able to teach or research what they choose.”The regulator is due to share further guidance before new free speech duties come into effect this year. It said: “Our published case report explains our findings in relation to the University of Sussex and sets out the reasons we concluded it had breached our regulatory requirements.”Explore more on these topicsHigher educationUniversitiesUniversity of SussexOffice for StudentsFreedom of speechTransgenderRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

His forces continue to fire on Ukraine, military and civilian targets alike.”The UK and Germany jointly convened Friday’s Ramstein meeting, which was attended by more than 40 countries but not the US. Pete Hegseth, Trump’s defence secretary, joined by video instead.Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, played down the Trump administration’s absence. He conceded that peace “appears to be out of reach in the immediate future” and said Ukraine was at the “epicentre of a broader conflict”.View image in fullscreenGermany’s Boris Pistorius said Ukraine was at the ‘epicentre of a broader conflict’.Photograph: Omar Havana/Getty“It is between freedom and oppression, between the recognition of global standards and aggressive imperialism, between democracy and authoritarianism,” Pistorius said, adding that military support for Ukraine would continue.The US’s attempts to bring about a quick end to the war have so far not succeeded. Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, held talks on Friday with Putin’s investment aide, Kirill Dmitriev, in St Petersburg. This followed avisit last weekby Dmitriev to Washington.Witkoff was also due to meet Putin, as the Kremlin cautioned that no breakthroughs and “nothing momentous” should be expected.Ukraine war briefing: Europe unveils new military support for Kyiv ahead of defence summitRead moreIn conversations with the White House,Russiahas refused to make concessions. Moscow demands control over four Ukrainian regions, the removal of Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s pro-western government and a ban on Nato membership for Ukraine. It also wants the lifting of sanctions.Trump issued a rare warning to Putin before the meeting on his social media platform, Truth Social. “Russia has to get moving. Too many people ere [sic] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war – A war that should have never happened, and wouldn’t have happened, if I were President!!!” he wrote.Trump has previously said he is“pissed off” by Putin’s failure to stop fightingbut he has not taken any serious measures to put pressure on Russia’s president. In interviews, Witkoff has parroted Kremlin talking points, telling the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that Russian-occupied Ukrainian regions had voted to join Moscow.The US envoy to Ukraine, Gen Keith Kellogg, appeared to echo such suggestions in an interview with the Times on Friday, in which he said that a demilitarised zone between Ukrainian and Russian forces could be established along the existing frontline.He also said that British and French troops could adopt zones of control in the west of the country as part of a “reassurance force”.“You could almost make it look like what happened with Berlin after World War Two, when you had a Russian zone, a French zone, and a British zone, a US zone,” he said.Since Ukraine agreed to a US ceasefire last month, Russia has dramaticallyescalatedits aerial bombing campaign. This week it launched a big military push in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions, seizing several border villages.There is speculation Russia is trying to grab as much territory as possible by 9 May, the day Russia celebrates its victory during the second world war, and before a possible peace deal.Estonia’s defence minister, Hanno Pevkur, said: “This is why we need to speed up the deliveries as quickly as we can.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This week a Russian ballistic missilehit a playgroundin the city of Kryvyi Rih, where Zelenskyy grew up, killing nine children and 11 adults.“Our priority is air defence. Patriots that remained unused in storage with our partners should be protecting lives,” Zelenskyysaid, adding that 10 more were urgently needed.Speaking at apress conferenceafter the Ramstein meeting, Pistorius said Germany had already given four Patriot systems to Kyiv and was waiting for more to be delivered. He said a global search was under way. “We will buy anything we can get,” he said.Germany will provide four Iris-T air defence systems as well as 15 Leopard 1 tanks, more reconnaissance drones and 100,000 artillery rounds, he added. Other governments announced fresh contributions.Healey said the UK and Norway would supply radar systems, anti-tank mines and “hundreds of thousands of drones” as part of a $560m defence package, on top of £4.5bn committed by Downing Street this year. The figure includes the repair of military vehicles damaged on the battlefield.Friday’s meeting did not clarify how many countries were ready to send troops to Ukraine as part of a “coalition of the willing”. Speaking to the BBC, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “Different member states have different opinions”. Discussions were still taking place, she added.The UK, France and Baltic nations have said they will put boots on the ground in the event of a peace settlement. AFP reported that six nations had signed up.Healey said planning for a so-called reassurance force was “real, substantial and well-advanced”. It envisages foreign soldiers being deployed away from the 1,000km-long frontline and boosting existing Ukrainian ground forces, he suggested.Russia has categorically rejected the idea. Sweden’s defence minister, Pål Jonson, said Stockholm needed answers to “a number of questions” before it could make a commitment. “It’s helpful if there’s a clarity of what that mission would entail, and what do we do – if we are peacekeeping, deterrence or reassurance,” he said.The UK has said the US military “backstop” – meaning comprehensive air cover – is essential for any mission to work. The Trump administration, however, has ruled this out and has indicated that Ukraine’s future security needs are now Europe’s problem.The Biden administration set up the Ukraine defence contact group after Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion and chaired meetings. In February the US relinquished this leadership role, handing it over to London and Berlin. Hegseth said the Trump administration had priorities elsewhere – in Asia and on America’s own borders.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaNatoEuropeJohn HealeyDefence policynewsShareReuse this content"

They also want the court to prevent the government from “enforcing the speech restrictions” imposed by the order.In 2021, a federal court in California considered a similar legal challenge after Trump imposed sanctions against Khan’s predecessor. In that case, the judge barred the government from enforcing the order against four law professors who assisted the ICC prosecutor, who she said were “likely to succeed on their first amendment challenge”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationInternational criminal courtDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to acquire the island and has not ruled out military or economic force to do so.The US Space Force said in a statement on Thursday night that Meyers had been removed from the position of commander on Thursday due to a “loss of confidence” in her ability to lead.“Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties,” it added.Vance’s posturing in Greenland was not just morally wrong. It was strategically disastrous | Timothy SnyderRead moreThe statement did not expand further, but the US websiteMilitary.comsaid Meyers sent an email to all personnel at Pituffik on 31 March “seemingly aimed at generating unity among the airmen and guardians, as well as the Canadians, Danes and Greenlanders who work there, following Vance’s appearance”.Vance visited the base on 28 March in a trip that was substantially changed at the last minute amid increasingly strained relations between the US, Greenland andDenmark. During the visit he told troops that the US had to gain control of the Arctic island to stop the threat of China and Russia.

But after outrage over the timing after the election – the new coalition government had yet to be sworn in – the plans were changed.The vice-president said during a press conference at the base: “Our message to Denmark is very simple: you have not done a good job by the people of Greenland.

Species-recovery grants, habitat conservation and restoration, and the interjurisdictional fisheries grant program, which supports coordinated management and research with the states, would all lose funding. The document also outlines a plan to move the NMFS under the US Fish and Wildlife Service.Noaa is facing a $1.3bn cut to overall operations and research, with various programs on the chopping block, and the National Ocean Service would be cut in half.Science done outside the agency would also be undermined with cuts to Noaa’s climate research grants program, which provides roughly $70m a year.Noaa fires hundreds of climate workers after court clears way for dismissalsRead more“It’s a really disturbing and concerning development – but I would say it is not all that surprising,” Spinrad said of the plans outlined in the document, noting that there have been many indications the administration would take steps such as these. “But it also has an element of randomness associated with it,” he added. “There are specific programs called out, the reasons for which are absolutely not clear.”The fallout from cuts this deep, should Congress adopt the president’s plan, would be felt in communities around the world, and in far-ranging sectors, from agriculture to emergency management.“By making a complete divestiture in science and in our research enterprise, we are basically saying we are not interested in improving our quality of life or our economy,” Spinrad said.The administration also outlined plans to severely defund research at Nasa, the country’s space agency. The agency is slated for a 20% overall budget loss, but deeper cuts would be directed at programs overseeing planetary science, earth science and astrophysics research,accordingto Ars Technica,which first on Trump’s planswhen agency officials were briefed last month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionNow documents have been issued to back up those plans, halving funding for science atNasa.The plan for Nasa would also scrap a series of missions, including some that the federal government has already poured billions of taxpayer dollars into. The Nancy Grace Roman space telescope, which could offer glimpses into distant galaxies after its scheduled launch next year, is among them, along with the Mars Sample Return and the Davinci mission to Venus. The GoddardSpaceFlight Center in Maryland, which employs roughly 10,000 people, would also be closed.“This is an extinction-level event for Nasa science,” Casey Dreier, chief of space policy for the Planetary Society, told the Washington Post. “It needlessly terminates functional, productive science missions and cancels new missions currently being built, wasting billions of taxpayer dollars in the process. This is neither efficient nor smart budgeting.”Still not set in stone, these “passback” documents are a part of how the government goes about budgeting. They are issued by the White House to federal agencies before the discretionary budget is released and are seen as a guidance on presidential priorities. The numbers aren’t final and could be changed, and Congress will also have to act on the plans to finalize them.Spinrad is confident that many legislators won’t support the cuts. “Many of the actions put forward by [the White House’s office of management and budget] are in direct contradiction to congressional intent,” he said. “Zeroing out programs that Congress has worked hard to authorize over the years – that’s a clarion call to specific members and sponsors.”There’s also likely to be strong pushback from the public and from industries that rely on the tools and services made possible by the country’s scientists.But the drastic degree of these cuts also shows the administration’s position on climate science and its determination to hamper US research, experts say. That alone is enough to cause concern.“This proposal will cost lives,” McLean said of the document if it is enacted. “When a room full of doctors tell you that it’s cancer, firing the doctors does not cure you.”Explore more on these topicsNasaClimate scienceTrump administrationDonald TrumpSpaceUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

There’s no age limit that I’m aware of, which is crazy.Search resumes for parts of helicopter that ‘fell into pieces’ killing six people in New YorkRead more“This was entirely predictable, and preventable. If we had a rollercoaster that killed people every two years, we would not keep it operating, yet we have the same kind of joy ride in the sky that kills people every couple of years, and we keep changing nothing,” he said.Investigators are working to establish the cause of Thursday’s crash, in which witnesses reported seeing the helicopter break up in midair and plunge in pieces into the river that runs between the west side of Manhattan and the eastern shore of New Jersey.According to the Associated Press, at least 38 people have died in helicopter accidents in New York City since 1977.A collision between a plane and a tourist helicopter over the Hudson in 2009killed nine people, and five died in 2018 when a charter helicopter offering “open door” flightswent down into city’s the East River.Stop the Chop has documented asuccession of other non-fatal incidentsinvolving helicopters in and around New York City in recent years, and Rosenthal said it was beyond time that city officials ended tourism flights from the downtown Manhattan heliport from which the Bell 206 chopper took off on Thursday, and two other public-use helipads on the island of Manhattan.According to theAviation Property Network, a specialist real estate company, the facilities generate a combined $2.7m annually for New York in lease payments from companies that operate more than 42,000 sightseeing trips annually.“The mayor can close down the Manhattan downtown heliport tonight, if he wanted to, one stroke of a pen and no other legislation needed,” said Rosenthal, whose group said more than 30,000 of the flights took off from there.“This is not the first crash, it’s another one in a long series. It’s predictable. It’s going to happen again, it’s just a matter of numbers. We’re OK with police, military, government, news, those are considered essential in our definition, but these non-essential flights are totally not needed.”Six people killed after helicopter crashes into Hudson River in New YorkRead moreEric Adams, the New York mayor, was asked about sightseeing flights on Friday on the Good Day New York TV show.“After any form of malfunction, crash or challenge, sometimes that’s [the] immediate thought … we should ban the helicopters or we should not have this tourism type of attraction in our city,” he said.“We have 65 million tourists that came into the city last year. This is all part of the attraction of being in New York. People want to see the city from the sky.“What is crucial is that any airport or any air device, that is done with the proper maintenance and proper safety.

His attorneys fought in recent days to block the execution, arguing he had suffered significant abuse and torture in his childhood and was denied a fair trial, but the state courts and US supreme court rejected the final petitions.Lawyers fight to stop South Carolina man’s execution by firing squadRead moreSouth Carolina’s Republican governor, Henry McMaster, announced minutes before Mahdi’s execution that he would not be commuting Mahdi’s sentence. No governor in the state hasgranted clemencyto a death row defendant in the last 50 years of the modern death penalty era.The state resumed executions last year after a 13-year pause caused by its inability to procure lethal injection supplies. Officials now direct people on death row to choose their method of killing – either electric chair, lethal injection and firing squad. Mahdi’s lawyers said he selected the “lesser of three evils” and opted to be shot instead of “burned and mutilated in the electric chair, or suffering a lingering death on the lethal injection gurney”.The state’s firing squad protocols called for Mahdi to be strapped to a chair and shot by three prison employees aiming at a bullseye placed on the chest. Mahdigave no final statementand did not look toward the witnesses in the room, which included his lawyer.Mahdi cried out when he was shot, his arms flexed, and he groaned two more times roughly 45 seconds after the bullets were fired, according to an Associated Pressreporter, who served as a media witness. His breaths continued for roughly 80 seconds before he appeared to take a final gasp. He was pronounced dead around 6.05 pm, less than four minutes after he was shot.“Mikal Mahdi was a smart, creative, intellectually curious person who could have done so much more with his life. He just never got the chance,” his lawyer, David Weiss, said in a statement on Friday evening. “Tonight, the state of South Carolina executed him by firing squad – a horrifying act that belongs in the darkest chapters of history, not in a civilized society … We love Mikal and will miss him deeply.”Unlike the state’sfirst executionlast year of a man whopresented evidence of his innocencein his final days, Mahdi’s lawyers have not disputed his conviction or the facts of his case.His attorneys argued his constitutional rights were violated and that he should not have been sentenced to death, documenting an upbringing of violence and neglect in a US supreme court petition.Some of Mahdi’s earliest memories were of his father abusing his mother, who fled when he was four, and by age nine he was suicidal and briefly committed to a psychiatric facility. He did not get further treatment, and was homeschooled by his father who embraced conspiracy theories, the petition said. Mahdi entered the prison system as a young teen.View image in fullscreenMembers of South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty speak in Columbia, South Carolina, before presenting petitions to ask the governor to grant clemency to Mikal Mahdi on Thursday.Photograph: Jeffrey Collins/APBetween ages 14 and 21, Mahdi spent an estimated total of 8,000 hours in solitary confinement while incarcerated, enduring prolonged isolation in conditions now widely regarded as torture, his attorneys said.At age 21, two months after a release from prison, he committed a series of violent crimes, including robbing a convenience store, fatally shooting the clerk, fleeing police and breaking into a shed at Myers’s home and killing him.Mahdi pleaded guilty, but his trial lawyers failed to properly advocate for him at sentencing, his attorneys argued. While prosecutors called 28 witnesses, Mahdi’s attorneys at the time called two individuals, only one of whom offered minimal testimony on his history of trauma.The judge did not learn about instances of extreme violence committed by his father, Mahdi’s severe mental health crises at a young age, or that he had spent the vast majority of his teenage years imprisoned without getting necessary treatment, often languishing in solitary, his lawyers said.After Mahdi’s trial counsels presented “barely half an hour” of “mitigating evidence”, the judge sentenced him to death, saying Mahdi lacked “humanity” and that it didn’t seem as if his “turbulent and transient childhood … contributed in any significant way” to the crimes.The South Carolina’s attorney general’s office argued Mahdi had exhausted his appeals and that his claims of ineffectual counsel had already been litigated.“Mikal died in full view of the system that failed him at every turn – from childhood to his final breath … Mikal’s life was a testament to systemic neglect, and his death was its final, cruel punctuation mark,” said Weiss, an assistant federal public defender. “We condemn the violence done to him as a child, as an adolescent in prison, and as an adult. Mikal’s story of abuse and neglect by the state is sadly not unique – but for the state to condemn a man who they broke as a child is not only a tragedy, it’s a collective failure of empathy by our society and by our entire system of justice.”Life on South Carolina death row: months of ‘barbaric’ isolation before executionRead moreOn death row, Mahdi had spent time reading history and nonfiction and trying to learn Spanish by watching Telemundo, Weisstold the Guardianin an earlier interview. In his final days, he had also asked to have his organs donated after his death, but his attorneys were told healthcare protocols would bar the donations.Anti-death penalty advocates held vigils this week calling for McMaster to grant clemency, and two of Mahdi’selementary school teachersalso publicly urged for his life to be spared.Mahdi is the 12th person executedthis yearso far. His killing comes one month after South Carolina shot dead 67-year-old Brad Sigmon, who was the first personexecuted by firing squadin the US in 15 years. There have only been three other firing squad executions under the contemporary death penalty,all in Utah, but Idaho recentlypasseda law to make shooting theprimary execution methodin the state. Last month, Louisiana carried out a rare executionusing nitrogen gas, an experimental method banned under state law foreuthanizing dogs and cats.South Carolina has executed five people in the last seven months and continues to face scrutiny over thesecrecy of its methodsand thebrutal conditionsmen face on death row.Explore more on these topicsSouth CarolinaCapital punishmentUS crimeUS prisonsnewsShareReuse this content"

These changes, which some saw as aligning Meta with the then incoming Trump administration, informed the LDF’s decision to leave the civil rights advisory group.That month, following Meta’s decision to its changes, the LDF joined a coalition of other civil rights organisations that were part of Meta’s external civil rights advisory group to express discontent with the company’s decision.“These changes are devastating for free expression because they will subject members of protected groups to more attacks, harassment, and harm, driving them off Meta’s services, impoverishing conversations, eliminating points of view, and silencing dissenting and oft-censored voices,” the companieswrote in a 14 January letterto Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. “Meta has apparently entirely failed to consider the chilling effect of its policy changes – and the result will be more self-censorship, not less.”Those concerns are still crucial for the LDF.“I am deeply disturbed and disappointed by Meta’s announcement on January 7, 2025, of irresponsible changes to the content moderation policies on its platforms that pose grave risks to the health and safety of Black communities and risk further destabilizing our republic,” the LDF associate director counsel Todd A Coxwrote in a letterdated 11 April.“For nearly a decade, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (LDF) has invested a great deal of time and resources working with Meta as part of an informal committee advising the company on civil rights issues. Yet Meta made these content moderation policy changes without consulting or warning this group, and many of the changes directly conflict with guidance from LDF and partners. As a result, LDF can no longer in good conscience participate as part of Meta’s civil rights advisory committee.”The LDF also took issue with Meta’s decision to roll back itsDEI policies. Before Meta’s January decision, the company reported success with its DEI initiatives: the company doubled the number of Black and Hispanic employees in the US two years ahead of its goal. Per a statement, the LDF is concerned that reversing DEI policies “could reinforce discriminatory barriers to employment at Meta and further exacerbate the potential for harm to Black communities using Meta’s platforms”.In ina separate letter to Meta, also dated 11 April, Cox wrote: “While Meta has altered its policies, its obligations under federal civil rights laws are unchanged. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other civil rights laws prohibit discrimination in the workplace, including disparate treatment, workplace policies that have an unfair disproportionate effect, and hostile work environment. Nor have the Trump administration’s false attacks on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility programs changed the legality of these efforts. If Meta fails its antidiscrimination obligations due to the absence of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility programs, it exposes itself to further legal liability.”In a statement, Cox said that “the grave impacts of Meta’s policy changes cannot be understated”.“Our country is in a perilous moment,” he said. “Meta’s changes exacerbate the risks to the health and safety of our communities. We hope that Meta reconsiders these policy changes. At minimum, we hope that Meta will evaluate whether the Community Notes system effectively reduces user engagement with false content. We also hope that Meta publicly reports the hateful posts on its platform and publicly discloses how the policy changes impact the number of posts that are reported and removed. To this end, we hope Meta will cooperate with the various scholars collecting this data and evaluating its impact on users.”Meta did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsMetaDEI policiesnewsShareReuse this content"

The cable also specifically points to “policies related to preferred personal pronouns” as potentially discriminatory against religious employees.While the document acknowledges that discrimination based on any religion violates federal law, the repeated emphasis on “anti-Christian bias” highlights a key theme Trump was happy to hit while on the campaign trail. At rallies, Trump vowed to be a champion to conservative Christian causes. Ahead of his executive order signing on 6 February, he indicated that the Department of Justice, the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service would be looked at for bias as well, through a taskforce led by the attorney general, Pam Bondi.But under the first amendment, thefounders wrotethat Congress shall “make no law respecting an establishment of religion”, a clearcut admonition to steer clear of imposing specific religious beliefs in government affairs.The state department cable encourages anonymous reporting, and the department asks staff to provide “names, dates, locations” of alleged incidents. Examples will be compiled for a preliminary report due by 22 April – just 11 days after the cable’s distribution – and incorporated into a government-wide assessment due in June.The cable instructs employees to report if they faced consequences for “refusing to participate in events or activities that promote themes inconsistent with or hostile to one’s religious beliefs”, which could potentially encompass diversity initiatives and LGBTQ+ inclusion efforts that were part of state department policy under the previous administration.According to Politico, some state department employees reacted with shock to the call to report their colleagues, saying it created a culture of fear. “It’s very Handmaid’s Tale-esque,” one department official told Politico.The state department did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpChristianityReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

The film, which competed at the 2024 Berlin film festival and won prizes in Europe and the US, shows the romantic awakening of a woman in Tehran who notably appears without the headscarf that is obligatory for women in Iran.The pair were sentenced to 14 months in prison, suspended for five years, and a fine on charges of “spreading lies with the intention of disturbing public opinion”, Dadban said. In addition, they were sentenced to one year in prison, also suspended for five years, and all equipment ordered confiscated for the charge of “participating in the production of vulgar content”. Another fine was ordered on the charge of “showing a film without a screening licence”, it added.‘We’re charged with propaganda, vulgarity and spreading prostitution’: the directors of My Favourite CakeRead moreThe New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran commented on the verdict, saying: “Artists in Iran endure significant hardships, including increasing censorship, arbitrary detentions and the constant threat of legal repercussions for expressing dissent through their work.”Even before their conviction, Moghaddam and Sanaeeha were banned from leaving Iran to attend the Berlin film festival and then promote the film when it was released in Europe. “We wanted to tell the story of the reality of our lives, which is about those forbidden things like singing, dancing, not wearing hijab at home, which no one does at home,” Moghaddam said earlier this year.News of the verdict came as the Cannes film festival announced that the new movie by another leading director banned from leaving Iran, Jafar Panahi,would be screenedat its 2025 edition. Another recent Iranian film, Mohammad Rasoulof’s The Seed of the Sacred Fig, which explicitly deals with the 2022-23 protest movement, resulted in the director and several of its actors fleeing the country, and those who remained unable to leave and subject to prosecution.Explore more on these topicsFilmIrannewsShareReuse this content"

Conceived on a symphonic scale, the huge demands this great and weightiest of choral masterpieces makes on his voices, treating them as instruments, are a deterrent to any but the finest choruses. Here, under the baton ofAndrew Manze, the fearless and very fine BBC National Chorus of Wales – schooled by chorus director Adrian Partington – acquitted themselves admirably. They tackled the high tessitura, notably the sopranos, and the tricky fugal writing with impunity and remarkable stamina. In the context of Llandaff Cathedral, despite their slightly awkward placement in the choir stalls behind Jacob Epstein’s Majestas, they maximised the resonance and, in the parts of the mass whose prevailing mood is not at all solemn, were joyful and exultant.Yet it was the exceptional quality of the solo quartet – treated by Beethoven as a micro-chorus, without any individual arias and set against the body of massed voices – that allowed the music’s complex structure to emerge clearly. Soprano Carolyn Sampson, mezzoSophie Harmsen, tenor Ed Lyon and bassDarren Jefferywere particularly well-matched in terms of vivid projection and richness of tone. In music as testing as any key operatic role, they nevertheless blended together, each ceding one to the other, in the manner of a string quartet, with Sampson soaring gloriously high in crowning passages.View image in fullscreenExceptional quality: the solo quartet(l to r)Carolyn Sampson, soprano; Sophie Harmsen, mezzo-soprano; Ed Lyon, tenor; Darren Jeffery, bass.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianAt the heart of the Sanctus section, the Benedictus is simply extraordinary. In it, these four voices realised a sublime expressive beauty, heightened by Beethoven’s interpolation of an ethereal solo violin, weaving in and around the vocal lines, perhaps inspired by the example of Bach and wonderfully played here by leader Lesley Hatfield. Eloquent playing by principals in theBBC National Orchestra of Walesalso marked this memorable evening.

Historians, critics and heritage tour guides give us their thoughtsAda PetriczkoFri 11 Apr 2025 09.16 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 09.18 EDTShareAReal Pain, Jesse Eisenberg’s film about two cousins on a heritage tour of Holocaust-related sites in Poland, has been largely embraced by Polish audiences, who appreciated its understated humour and conspicuous good intentions. Within a month of its release, the film had grossed more than $1m at the Polish box office – no small feat for an indie production in Poland. “There was a collective sigh of relief,” says Vogue Poland film critic Anna Tatarska, “that here was a Hollywood Holocaust narrative that didn’t cast Poles as historical villains.”Poland’s fraught relationship with Holocaust narratives has made films touching on it into political battlegrounds for at least a decade. Since the nationalist backlash against films such as Aftermath (Pokłosie) in 2012, andIdaa year later – each of which confronted Polish complicity in wartime Jewish persecution – cinema has become a flashpoint in Poland’s ongoing struggle with historical memory. Against this backdrop, A Real Pain occupies an unusually diplomatic position, and this political neutrality helped Eisenberg’s film achieve what others couldn’t: acceptance not only from Polish audiences but also officialdom.It’s a joy that people keep on coming here – to restore memory, to catch these threads from before the HolocaustWitold WrzosińskiPresident Andrzej Duda went so far as granting Eisenberg Polish citizenship during a ceremony in New York in March. Eisenberg, who had been interested in becoming a Pole for nearly two decades, called it an honour of a lifetime. “Poland as an idea gave me a certain meaning that I was missing,”he told the New Yorker in November. “Having a connection to something bigger, something historic, something traumatic, made me feel like I was a real person and not just floating through a lucky life of shallow emptiness.”But whileA Real Painwas promoted as Eisenberg’s love letter to Poland, many Poles still feel it failed to represent them adequately. Perhaps most tellingly, the film’s only significant interaction with the locals occurs in a single scene near the end, when the Kaplan cousins arrive at the house where their grandmother used to live and briefly talk with two neighbours. Poles are otherwise background characters – a mostly voiceless crowd of receptionists, waiters and taxi drivers. “Poland is only a backdrop here, a beautiful and wealthy decoration that is essentially empty, because no real people inhabit it,” historian and writer Irena Grudzińska-Gross said.Witold Wrzosiński, the director of the Jewish Cemetery in Warsaw, noted that Polish Jews, a community that today numbers some 30,000, are completely absent from the film. (Before the Holocaust, Jews made up 10% of Poland’s population; of the 3.5 million living there in 1939, only about 300,000 survived.) “It felt as if Eisenberg sent his love letter without an addressee,” he said. “And we watched it as outside spectators.”View image in fullscreenEisenberg and Jennifer Grey in the film.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyWrzosiński recalled that after a special screening for representatives of the Jewish community in Warsaw, there was a sense that the film missed some opportunities, mostly because of its choice not to develop local characters. “The most unexpected, cinematic situations during heritage tours happen at the crossroads between the visitors and Poles,” said Wrzosiński, who spent years leading such tours. The Kaplan cousins arrive and leave Poland more or less unchanged – a narrative choice that is intentional and self-aware. But perhaps by focusing primarily on their relationship and their pain, the film is doing precisely what it claims to be against – it fails to engage with Poland and the Holocaust in a meaningful way.Poland is only a backdrop here, because no real people inhabit itIrena Grudzińska-Gross“I think that people on these trips put a lot of pressure on themselves to feel something. We’re very good at manufacturing the kind of experiences that we expect to have,” said Adam Schorin, a writer from New York who has worked as a heritage tour guide in Poland. “But what I found more interesting when visiting Holocaust-related sites are questions about the nature of remembrance, such as what are we actually seeing and how can we engage with a place that has been photographed a million times and perhaps recently renovated?”The most biting critique, perhaps, lies in the film’s selective amnesia, sidestepping uncomfortable conversations about wider antisemitism in Poland. “We don’t get to find out what happened to the cousins’ family during the war, and why their grandmother emigrated soon after. She must have had a good reason to leave, right? Otherwise she would have stayed,” says Grudzińska-Gross, who was forced to flee Poland in 1968 amid an antisemitic campaign.‘Every day is 24 hours of panic to just get out the door’: Jesse Eisenberg on self-indulgence, candid aunts and his Oscar-tipped Holocaust comedyRead more“I think many people fell into the trap of expecting too much from this film, and assuming that since it’s connected to the Holocaust, it must be epic, it must be anotherSon of Saul,” says Tatarska. “You can interpret these [artistic] decisions negatively, and there were people in Poland who did, but I would expect them to be mostly financially driven. I think this is a genuine love letter, but written by someone who has less lived experience and more ideas about what Poland could be.”But despite its shortcomings, Wrzosiński sees the film as a heartfelt attempt at overcoming disconnections. “There’s a sense of joy that people keep on coming here – and we see more of them each year – to restore memory, to catch these threads from before the Holocaust and to talk not only about how their ancestors died, but also about how they lived here for 20 generations. And if this film encourages anyone to do this, that’s great.”Explore more on these topicsA Real PainPolandJesse EisenbergKieran CulkinEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

So it is with the super-rich spa satireThe White Lotus. The gunsmoke is still clearing from the finale of the third season but speculation is rife about where the HBO hit will head next.This week’s climax ofMike White’s drama might have divided critics, but it was still group chat-dominating, column inch-gobbling TV, notching its highest ratings yet. The show was renewed for a fourth trip before the third had even aired, with White reportedly pitching HBO execs his next idea while still filming in Koh Samui. Buzz is now building about the next chapter, expected on our screens in late 2026.View image in fullscreenMike White accepts a Golden Globe for The White Lotus in January 2023.Photograph: Rich Polk/NBC/GettyEach season has unfolded at a luxury resort in a different region. Viewers have been whisked to the Pacific (the debut season in Hawaii), Europe (the Sicily-set sequel) and Asia (the third hotel from hell, filmed in Thailand). White has previously said his dream for the show is to “hit every continent”.If the pattern continues, options are likely to be Africa (there are rumours of a Moroccan riad, Kenyan safari or a sightseeing tour of Egypt), South America (Buenos Aires has been mentioned) or Australia (White has alluded to its “wealth of talent”).A factor is the production’s partnership with Four Seasons, after signing a reported £25m deal in 2021 to film exclusively in the high-end chain’s resorts. Its five-star hotel in Marrakech’s ancient medina has emerged as a frontrunner. White apparently stayed at the Four Seasons Tamarindo in Mexico before Christmas, potentially on a research trip. He is also said to have looked at £1,000-per-night glamping at the Four Seasons in Tanzania’s Serengeti national park.View image in fullscreenThe Juvet Landscape hotel in Norway featured in HBO’s series Succession.Photograph: Juvet LandskapshotellThere is conjecture that after three sun-soaked stories, a cold climate would provide a change of gear. White had been spotted in Norway, making that a strong favourite. Local press reports suggest it nearly happened for season three. There are no Four Seasons sites in Norway, but spectacular alternatives include the Juvet Landscape hotel, which featured in theHBOseries Succession.However, the show’s producer, David Bernad, has hinted this is a longshot, saying: “Mike doesn’t like the cold. He’s a California guy. He’s not built for snow.” For his part, White has teased that the fourth season could move away from beach settings, saying: “I want to get a little bit out of the ‘crashing waves on rocks’ vernacular.”View image in fullscreenMike White is said to have looked at glamping sites at the Four Seasons in Tanzania’s Serengeti national park.Photograph: Richard WaiteTax incentives and subsidies will play a part in the decision, making Japan an attractive proposition. Four Seasons Kyoto or Osaka head the shortlist here. However, there have been calls for the production to stay closer to home. The media union Sag-Aftra wants the fourth season to be shot in California as part of its “stay in LA” initiative.Perhaps the most definitive clue came from HBO’s head of drama, Francesca Orsi, who said in February: “We’re location scouting in the next couple of weeks. I can’t really say where we’re going to land but chances are somewhere in Europe.”View image in fullscreenCould Simona Tabasco from White Lotus season two be in the running?Photograph: Fabio Lovino/APThere are plenty of Four Seasons spots in mainland Europe to choose from, notably Cap-Ferrat in the French Riviera. However, White will not take an obvious path. “Where we choose to go next could be hugely impactful to that destination,” he told the Hollywood Reporter. “That’s why it was so cool to shoot in Thailand. It’s hard to go backward. Doing it in Paris feels like a cop-out.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stick a pin in a list of A-list acting talent. Woody Harrelson came close to being cast in season three as the Bangkok berserker Frank, ultimately played by Sam Rockwell. It was only scheduling conflicts that scuppered Harrelson’s involvement, so he could be high on the hitlist next time. Hollywood names will probably be joined by a scene-stealing British actor or two, with big impressions made by Tom Hollander, Leo Woodall, Jason Isaacs andAimee Lou Woodin previous series.Each season has featured overlapping characters.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Not in living memory has a generation received more abuse than millennials. First the older generation told them their economic woes were due to a weak handshake in job interviews and a crippling addiction to brunch. Now, an even more malignant torrent of abuse is coming from below. Gen Z, in an attempt to distance themselves from the tragic fate of their forebears, have declared war.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Every young person seems to be mocking the sincerity and optimism of a generation – born roughly between 1981 and 1996 – who imbibed the spirit of the Obama era and seemed to believe that if they worked hard, their dreams would come true. Except they didn’t: instead came Brexit, Trump, Covid and AI-generated videos of Elon Musk doing the moonwalk.TikToker Kyle Gordon, for example, is now going viral for a parody millennial folk-pop song called We Will Never Die that blends We Are Young by Fun and Ho Hey by the Lumineers with the waistcoats and flat caps of Mumford & Sons. The song’s lyrics satirise the simplistic political messaging prevalent in the era of Occupy and Kony 2012: “Yup, we did a thing / We let our voices ring / Politicians, hear us sing, stop lyin”.As a gen Zer (just – I’m 1997) who has been shaped by millennial culture, I have seen a sharp rise in this sort of elder abuse. So much so that it informs much of my new show, Return of the Space Cowboy, which mines the tension between my innate gen Z scepticism and my desperate need to find something to believe in. As such, I simply cannot take the slander of my noble elders any more.They are a generation too old to be cool but too young to be viewed through rose-tinted (and fashionably oversized) frames. But mark my words, the near future will see the streets lined with millennial-themed bars with exposed brick walls and cocktails served out of mason jars. MGMT’s Time to Pretend will be triumphantly blasting out of the speakers as you remark that your “dad loves these guys”. People will start taking bathroom selfies with an iPhone 3G for that retro digital feel, while clad in smart-casual numbers, waistcoats with jeans, blazers with skinny chinos, fedoras and fraying festival wristbands snaking up their arms. Soon young people will be lamenting being born in the wrong era and say things like “take me back to 2013 so I can wear a bow tie while I penny board to my job making BuzzFeed listicles about which Friends character you are”.As a tribute to this maligned group of pioneers, I’ve collected four masterpieces made by millennials that have inspired me and deserve their place in the cultural canon.1.Girls (2012-2017)View image in fullscreenJilted generation … (l-r) the characters Marnie Michaels, Jessa Johansson, Hannah Horvath and Shoshanna Shapiro of Girls.Photograph: HBO/AllstarInGirls, Hannah Horvath says to her parents: “I don’t want to freak you out but I might be the voice of my generation … well a voice … of a generation.” The line was intended to highlight Hannah’s narcissism and self delusion but I do sincerely think that with Girls, Lena Dunham, who created the show and stars as Hannah, stakes a solid claim to being the voice of the millennials.Lena Dunham’s Girls: the show that turned TV upside downRead moreNo show better captures the essence of the 2010s more than Girls. A sitcom for an era that felt uniquely confusing and hard to define compared to the ones that came before. The groundbreaking realism of relationships shown for all their glorious awkwardness and weirdness – a far cry from the gloss of Friends or Sex and the City. A show that paired the uncertainty of being in your 20s with the uncertainty of post-financial crash New York.A show that was as heartbreaking as it was hilarious – take the opening scene where Hannah is being cut off from her middle-class parents and she reminds them, “I could be a drug addict. Do you realise how lucky you are?” Or there was the truly excruciating moment when Marnie tries to get back at her ex-boyfriend by singing a sincere rendition of Kanye West’sStronger; a scene so toe-curling that I have to hide behind the sofa like a dog on Bonfire Night whenever I watch it.It is one of the few shows I can watch over and over again because unlike most 30-minute TV shows it doesn’t follow a repetitive formula. Every episode is so unpredictable, the depth and complexity of the characters so much more than your usual sitcom archetypes, that I learn something new on every rewatch.2.Submarine (2010)View image in fullscreenKiller Wales … Craig Roberts in Submarine.Photograph: Film4/AllstarAt their worst, millennial films become pretentious aesthetic exercises in style over substance. But when it’s done right, as it was by Richard Ayoade in his debut feature, it results in a charming and hilarious coming-of-age film enriched with a patchwork of aesthetic references from French, Italian and British new wave cinema.We follow teenage oddball Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts) in his quest for love in front of the bleak industrial backdrop of 1980s Swansea. I saw this film in the cinema when I was 13 years old and couldn’t believe that a film could be so beautifully made and cinematically vibrant while simultaneously being so packed with so many great jokes. The 2010s was the era of the “dramedy”, AKA the blending of comedy and drama, and maybe there is no better example of this thanSubmarine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Millennial giants such as Eric André. The first time I saw André’s truly bizarre talkshow parody when I was 16 years old it felt as if I was watching a new sense of humour come into being. It is not as characteristically “millennial” as other things on this list because in many ways it was laying the ground for the unhinged brain-rot humour that defines the TikTok generation today.Comedian Eric Andre: 'We don't tell guests a thing ...'Read moreThe Eric Andre Show felt like it was only understandable to a generation that grew up with the internet. Whether it was getting seemingly unsuspecting celebrities on as guests and then making the atmosphere as deranged and chaotic as possible – the host throwing up and eating his own sick until the guest leaves, or the consistent smashing up of his desk – André was an early proponent of the unhinged humour that is now very much in the mainstream. The absurdist end of TikTok virality can be traced back to André’s underrated masterpiece.4.Alt-J – An Awesome Wave (2012)View image in fullscreenGive us a wave … Alt-J.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianAlt-J’s Mercury prize-winning debut album An Awesome Wave is a true millennial masterpiece. Not only because it’s a great album, but the rise and fall ofAlt-Jas a band is one of the great millennial tragedies. I was 14 when this album came out and people were musing that the new Radiohead, or even Pink Floyd, had arrived. The album was packed with obscure literary and cinematic references over a rich pulsating soundscape of haunting voices. White guys finally had new music to lecture women about.Until, in 2016, disaster struck. A video went viral of two drunk students making a parody of Alt-J’s music using a loop machine, a tambourine and repeatedly singing “put it up my butt” in different harmonies. It showed that anyone could make a song as good as any Alt-J song. Never before have I seen a parody song so quickly unpack a band’s mystique, and frankly Alt-J never recovered. Part of the reason they never recovered was because the band members have as much charisma as a recycling bin. Do you even remember any of their names? Exactly.Millennial internet culture had a tendency to eat itself – things became cool and uncool at ever quickening rates leaving little to hold on to. But sifting back through the archives of the early 2010s, I do think An Awesome Wave is a gorgeous album, worthy of its acclaim.Horatio Gould is touring the UK withReturn of the Space Cowboyfrom 2 to 23 May; tour starts Glasgow.

The 2025 edition is being viewed by some as an unofficial comeback with headliners Lady Gaga,Green Dayand Post Malone, who together boast 24% higher global Spotify streams than the previous trio.Gaga previously headlined Coachella in 2017, when she also filmed scenes for A Star Is Born. In arecent interview, she said she would focus on her new album, Mayhem, but also give fans the older hits they want. She said she saw it as “an opportunity to do something unique and special” but remained tightlipped about specifics.“I genuinely don’t want to give anything away aboutCoachella,” she said. “I know that is heartless of me, in a way, but I could honestly cry on the phone with you just thinking about how excited I am to do this show, and I want it to be a total surprise, and want everyone to have as much fun as possible.”The lineup boasts a wide variety of acts from different genres and eras. The newer guard is represented by Lola Young, Shaboozey, Amyl and the Sniffers, Rema, underscores and Glorilla, while nostalgia plays are led by Jimmy Eat World,Missy Elliott, Kraftwerk, Basement Jaxx and the Go-Gos.The weekend will also see the Prodigy play, returning to Coachella for the first time sinceKeith Flint died in 2019. “I will say that us carrying on isn’t a Keith tribute show,” band member Liam Howlett recently told theLos Angeles Times. “We want to honor him, and we will continue to do that, because Keith is more than just a person they saw on stage. Even though he wasn’t a musician, he was such an important person in the studio as a right-hand man.”Another throwback act playing is Weezer, a band who have been making headlines this week after bassist Scott Shriner’s wife, Jillian Lauren, was shot by police.Reports claimthat she aimed a handgun at officers as they investigated an unrelated hit-and-run incident and she is now being charged with attempted murder.The band is still set to perform as scheduled with Scottsaying“see you at Coachella” to journalists on Thursday.One act who won’t be performing is FKA twigs, who wasforced to pull out“due to ongoing visa issues” related to her production team reportedly failing to fill out the correct paperwork in time. The star wrote that she was “devastated” in an Instagram statement.Rising costs and more complicated logistics have also caused trouble for other artists seeking visas to perform. “I just did visas for a Coachella band and it was $8,000,” a booking agency executive told theLos Angeles Times. “It’s becoming a huge financial hurdle because it takes so long through regular channels, you have to go for the heavy-duty expediting.”Explore more on these topicsCoachellaLady GagaCharli xcxGreen DayEd SheeranThe ProdigyWeezernewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Secateurs are the single most valued tool in the gardener’s trug, an implement as personally prized as the bricklayer’s trowel. With time, their weight and shape wear familiarly into the hand, becoming a companionable tool for all garden tasks, from pruning woody shrubs and cutting back perennials to slicing twine and preparing cut flowers.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There are two main types of secateurs, bypass and anvil. The latter comprises a single blade that cuts against a flat, blunt surface, designed for cutting tougher, woodier or dead stems. Bypass secateurs – by far the most commonly used of the two, and what I’ve focused on here – comprise two blades that pass each other closely, providing a clean and accurate cut. These secateurs tackle the everyday things: lighter shrub pruning, deadheading, slicing twine and so on.If well looked after (see below), a quality pair of bypass secateurs can last decades; as a result, gardeners declare staunch loyalties to particular models. I wasintroduced to a brand early on in my gardening career and have used the same one for more than 15 years, so it’s high time I stepped out of my comfort zone and considered some new candidates.To help me, and you, navigate a bewildering number of models – and with the arrival of spring – I put 12 pairs through their paces. Here are the nine best secateurs from my tests.At a glanceBest secateurs overall:Burgon & Ball bypass secateurs£23 at Farrar & TannerBest secateurs for tough stems:Felco Model 2£64.99 at B&QBest budget secateurs:Spear & Jackson Razorsharp Advantage bypass secateurs£9.95 at AmazonBest secateurs for comfort:Niwaki GR Pro£84 at Burford Garden CoWhy you should trust meIn my almost two decades as a professional gardener, I have encountered every possible use for a trusty pair of secateurs – from sculptural pruning to paint tin opening (ill-advised). I know the strain they’re often put under and what is required of a durable pair. I’m also something of a neat freak: if a stem or branch can be cut to smarten a scene, I’ll likely have chopped it five minutes ago.My day-to-day as head gardener at London’sGarden Museumincludes anything from shaping shrubs and sprucing perennials to snipping stems for indoor flower arrangements. My role also entails leading a hearty and commendable crew of regular volunteers of all ages, who will be the recipients of these secateurs.How I testedView image in fullscreenA game of secateur hide and seek helped me test their visibility.Photograph: Clemmie Power CollinsWith spring in the air, the time for cutting back perennials and grasses in advance of new growth, I took each pair to task in my own garden. I tidied up the small stuff first: old aster stems, scrappy libertia leaves, brittle mounds of purple moor-grass.While affordability, maintainability and sleek appearance are all considerations when selecting secateurs, for me, there are four key criteria they ought to meet. The first is sharpness. If ever I am frustrated with a pair of secateurs, it is most likely due to their failure to cut through finer plant material: slender or fibrous flower stems, the matted hair of ornamental grasses.The second criterion concerns how well they cut through thicker stems: small shrub branches, roses, the hardened stalk of a sunflower. This is as much down to the body of the secateurs as the blade. With plenty of living and lignified hazel, elder and buddleia around the garden, I tested each pair on various tougher materials.The third important consideration is comfort: handles areeverything. Whether or not a pair feels securely gripped in the hand comes down to the coating, be it plastic, rubber or metal. Comfort, however, tends to be dictated by their shape and girth.The fourth is the catch lock. Being able to lock secateur blades shut with ease is crucial. Left open they become a hazard, the sharp blade easily knocked against or catching a finger. Most secateurs are configured with a catch easily manoeuvred with the thumb; in some models, this is substituted with a latching lock at the bottom of the handles. Convenience makes all the difference, as locking is frequent between cuts.There is one other factor I thought was worth testing: visibility. Secateurs are frequently put down, dropped or absent-mindedly stowed, and therefore easily lost. So, a level of conspicuousness can help, and some brands have opted for vibrant, standout colours. To test this, I asked our five-year-old to do what five-year-olds do best and lose each pair, one by one, in the garden – under parental supervision, of course. My wife timed my subsequent searches.The best secateurs in 2025View image in fullscreen‘A mid-range contender that jostles with the premier pruners’: Burgon & Ball bypass secateurs.Photograph: Clemmie Power CollinsBest secateurs overall:Burgon & Ball bypass secateursView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Clemmie Power Collins£23 at Farrar & Tanner£20.99 at TescoDespite alloy handles, a carbon-steel blade and an endorsement from the Royal Horticultural Society, I didn’t expect a workaday pair of secateurs like Burgon & Ball’s to top the lot. They’re not only sharp, robust and comfortable but also reasonably priced: a mid-range contender that jostles with the premier pruners.Why we love itOn the surface, there’s nothing extraordinary about these secateurs. In appearance, they adopt a look recognisable in many other brands – the long shaft, swivelling thumb clasp, volute spring and indented handles. However, these unremarkable features are put together remarkably well: in the hand, Burgon & Ball’s secateurs feel comfortable, lightweight and well-balanced, while the blade had little trouble slicing through matted grass and larger stems alike. When cutting 2cm+ diameter material, you might need to apply some brute force – or consider the loppers – but for anything below, these make light, easy and precise work.They stood out well in the visibility test, too. Owing to the intentionally conspicuous orange of the handles, it took a mere 17 seconds for me to locate them in the garden (half hidden beneath a cistus shrub). They’re also built with maintenance in mind: the blade and spring can be removed for cleaning or replacing (they come supplied with a spare of each, though I’m not sure whether that’s reassuring or disconcerting!). All in all, an excellent, robust and comfortable model that, even after long use, doesn’t strain the hands and wrists.It’s a shame that …the screw head on the blade has been left exposed – it’s sure to collect mud.Max cutting diameter:up to 2.5cmLeft handed available?Yes (£22.95 at Amazon)Best secateurs for tough stems:Felco Model 2View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Clemmie Power Collins£64.99 at B&Q£55.55 at AmazonSwiss company Felco is amongthe best known of all secateur brands. Individually numbered, its series of red-handled pruners ranges from compact, professional and premium models to left-handed and rotating-handled options. Model 2 is its original, classic pair, hyped by working and amateur gardeners.Why we love itThere’s an undeniable heft to Felco secateurs that offers reassurance: going at the thicker growth of my rampant buddleia, I never doubted the robustness of the body or the force behind the blade. Felco was founded in 1945 and operated out of an old watch dial factory – so the origin story goes. It introduced clockwork precision and finesse to the rugged world of garden maintenance (it also makes loppers, knives and saws). Its tools are made from 70% recycled aluminium and any steel it uses is 95% recycled alloy. All parts can be replaced and the company offers a reconditioning service: secateurs for life, in theory.When put to the test on the small stuff, the blades cut cleanly each time, never folding or squashing material in that annoying way that secateurs sometimes can. They felt nicely balanced and undemanding on the wrist, the handles pleasantly cushioned by rounded rubber pads. The thumb clasp is second to none, and there’s no two ways about it, that blazing red was engineered for prominence: it took me all of six seconds to spy the pair hidden among the plant pots.It’s a shame that …they’re just not quite as affordable as other brands.Max cutting diameter:2.5cmLeft handed available?NoBest budget secateurs:Spear & Jackson Razorsharp Advantage bypass secateursView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Clemmie Power Collins£18.95 at Tooled Up£9.95 at AmazonPossibly the most simply designed and hard-working budget secateurs I’ve had the pleasure of trying, Spear & Jackson’s economic offering is a genuine gem. The quality of performance is a level above their station.Why we love itWith any budget item, there will be inevitable compromises. When it comes to secateurs, however, the element you least want to sacrifice is the quality of the blade, and this, clearly, is what Spear & Jackson prioritised with its Razorsharp Advantage bypass secateurs. The carbon steel blade is durable and smooth and glides neatly beside its chrome counterpart for a faultless cut.The drawbacks lie elsewhere: the basic coil spring; the lightweight plastic handles; and I wasn’t wild about the lock slider at the top. However, they’re extremely comfortable for the price – no mean feat in the world of secateurs – and the 10-year guarantee aids confidence.Cutting a mixture of grasses and perennials, the Razorsharp Advantage secateurs delivered a satisfyingly smooth “chop”, and handled most shrubby material well, provided it wasn’t too large. Aesthetically speaking, I’d say they look pretty good, too: no frills, but no clumsy components either.Spear & Jackson doesn’t offer a reconditioning service, though it does offeradvice on cleaning and restoring secateur blades.It’s a shame that …they’re not just a little tougher with larger material.Max cutting diameter:1.5cmLeft handed available?NoBestsecateurs forcomfort:Niwaki GR ProView image in fullscreen£84 at Burford Garden Co£92.40 at AmazonYou’re not just purchasing a pair of secateurs here: you’re subscribing to a certain quality, comfort and aesthetic in agardening hand tool. Niwaki’s bestselling secateurs are a masterclass in elegance and functionality.Why we love itSpy a gardening colleague unsheathing any one of Niwaki’s sleekly designed, uber-refined tools, and you know they’re not messing around. The brand is the brainchild of Wiltshire-based founder Jake Hobson, and it adheres to the traditions of Japanese tool craft, producing primarily Japan-made hand tools that are as beautiful as they are useful.Professional gardeners swear by the GR Pro secateurs for good reason. For one, my goodness, do they feel good. There’s a balance in the palm that I’ve genuinely never felt before, and although there are no finger indentations on the handle, they are ingeniously shaped for support. When you open them up, the stylish central spring pushes apart the handles (and, by proxy, the blades) to just the right extent, stabilising them pleasantly in your hand and presenting a wide mouth to the material at hand. Indeed, the top blade itself is noticeably larger than most: unusually for secateurs, it neatly meets the bottom of the corresponding bypass.Practically speaking, the cut is unreal. True to the Japanese heritage, the GR Pro’s blades cut so cleanly that I got sidetracked shaping leaves to within a millimetre. Similarly, they handled the shrubby stuff with comparative ease. So what’s the snag, you might ask? For me, it’s the catch lock. Located at the bottom of the handles, locking and unlocking becomes a little more cumbersome than with a thumb clasp. Perhaps this is a matter of practice, though – when I queried a gardening pal on how she locks hers, she pinged me a video demonstrating a swift knock against the leg – apparently so intuitive a knack she’s never actually realised she does it. As for visibility: sure, with their muted yellow handles they took a fraction longer to spot among the perennials. Let’s face it, though: you’re unlikely to let these covetable cutters out of your sight in the first place.Niwaki doesn’t offer secateur blade replacements but it does have asecateur sharpening service. And it supplies replacement springs – the GR Pro comes with one.It’s a shame that …it takes two hands to unlock them, and they’re on the more expensive side. Everything else is perfection.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Okatsune is a Japan-based manufacturer conceived by a former blacksmith. It boasts blades made from the same steel from which Samurai swords are fashioned: a confidence boost for sure when it comes to keenness and durability. I particularly liked the red-and-white colouration of the handles, which, according to Okatsune, symbolises happiness in Japan. I liked the more affordable price tag, too.It didn’t make the final cut because …they feel just a little top-heavy in the hand, with the blade ever so slightly outweighing the handles.Max cutting diameter:2.5cmLeft handed available?NoJiveSnip Premium titanium garden secateursView image in fullscreen£7.99 at AmazonBest for:a satisfying snipGardeners will concur that there is no one generic “snip” sound common to all secateurs; each has its signature slice. As is implicit in the name, JiveSnip’s uniquely satisfying snip is the product of its titanium blade, which severs smaller diameter garden material with a curiously pleasing feel – worth the price alone. The other, less subtle distinguishing feature of these secateurs is their overtly padded handles, which, according to the manufacturer’s blurb, provide non-slip, fatigue-free pruning. Excepting larger, woodier material, I found this to be true enough, though I imagine they may collect soil with extended use.It didn’t make the final cut because …the handle grips are just a little too spongy for my liking.Max cutting diameter:2cmLeft handed available?NoDarlac Cut’n’Hold bypass prunerView image in fullscreen£17.99 at Charlies£20.95 at B&QBest for:deadheadingDarlac produces a range of bypass secateurs, but I was intrigued by its Cut’n’Hold pruners in particular, contrived with a clasp function intended to ease deadheading and cut-flower gathering. Closing in unison with the adjacent bypass blades, the lightly serrated clasp will hold a stem in place while the blades sever it from the plant. Rather brilliantly, I found this works as effectively for soft, slight stems (eg pulmonaria, geranium) as for woodier examples such as rosemary and helichrysum, each time keeping hold of the stem until released. Add to that a nice metal top clasp (at last, a top clasp that works smoothly!), comfortable handles and Felco-like red visibility, and you’ve got a really solid, if slightly niche, pair of secateurs.It didn’t make the final cut because …I found that offcuts can occasionally trap between the clasp and the blade.Max cutting diameter:2cmLeft handed available?NoKent & Stowe Garden Life all-purpose mini secateursView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Clemmie Power Collins£14.99 at Marshalls Garden£14.99 at BentsBest for:small hands and surprising strengthTrialling a few Kent & Stowe mid-price secateurs, I’d intended to review its all-purposeEversharpmodel. However, I was so impressed with its more compact mini pair, I had to give them a shoutout instead. The big surprise here is that, despite the low price and dainty size (17cm in length), this little model can tackle stems that have proven challenging for average-size secateurs. The snip is clean, the grip is fast and the handles are rigid: an excellent pair for delicate propagative work and rigorous chopping alike. But, buyers take heed: dressed in muted greys and earthy brown handles, this little wonder is liable to vanish into the undergrowth if dropped – it took me the longest to find by a good minute.It didn’t make the final cut because …the catch lock is somewhat fiddly, which might be expected for so compact a pair of secateurs.Max cutting diameter:1.5cmLeft handed available?NoRyobi 18V ONE+ cordless secateursView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Clemmie Power Collins£114.99 (bare tool) at Ryobi Tools£122 (bare tool) at B&QBest for:effortless pruning and for those requiring cutting assistanceA few electric-assisted secateurs are available, with companies such as Stihl and Worx throwing their hats into the ring. However, Ryobi’s cordless 18V One+ model is among the most competitively priced. If, like me, you’ve not tried electric sheers before, you’re in for a novel experience. Activated and deactivated with a hold of the trigger, once you get snipping it’s addictive – without restraint, beloved shrubs will soon be reduced to kindling. Comfortable and unexpectedly precise, this is a fantastic option for thicker stems, and for those who require some assistance with their pruning. You’ll need to buy abattery and charger, andsafety glassesare advisable, all available from Ryobi.It didn’t make the final cut because …it wouldn’t be fair – this one’s got an 18V battery!Max cutting diameter:2.5cmLeft handed available?No, but they are ambidextrousHow to look after your secateursView image in fullscreenOil the clasp and spring for a smooth action.Photograph: Clemmie Power CollinsThe key to prolonging the life of any pair of bypass secateurs is to keep them clean, oiled and sharp. After rigorous use, wipe away any soil or debris from the body and blade using a damp cloth. If there’s a detachable central spring, remove this and clean inside it. Using a whetstone, carefully sharpen the edge of the blade before wiping it with another clean, oiled cloth. Finish by oiling the clasp and spring for a smooth action.Some secateur suppliers offer a maintenance service.Felcodoes this with a 28-day turnaround, returning your pair by post fully restored and sharpened. Lastly, it may look a little dorky, but a secateur holster – worn on the belt – will help ensure your cherished pair is kept dry and clean, and safely stowed after each use.Matt Collins is a garden, nature and travel writer, and head gardener at the Garden Museum in LondonExplore more on these topicsGardensThe FilterGardening advicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

She has grown up with her phone and is always on it, but with me she takes hours or days to text back, and sometimes ignores my messages entirely.I don’t understand it. She’s on social media all the time and I see her liking and commenting on posts. But when it comes to responding to me, she takes for ever. I’ll send her a message about something simple and she’ll blank it. Then, days later, she’ll send me a meme on Instagram. I’ll nudge her in the text chat and she will apologise and reply, but I don’t understand why she can’t just respond within a normal time, which I think is 48 hours.I don’t want to sound like a desperate friend, but if she has time to scroll on Instagram, why can’t she take 10 seconds to send me a reply? Often I’m not expecting long conversations, but I can never rely on her for an impromptu catch-up or a brief back and forth. I have to schedule calls or meet-ups weeks in advance, or triple text her to get a response.Once, I asked her if she wanted to meet up, and she replied a month later. She said she just forgotTo be fair, she’s always been like this, and her boyfriend says it also drives him mad. But with things getting busier – I’m pregnant and we don’t live close to one another any more – I feel she needs to step up. I’m worried that we won’t stay connected when I have my baby.Once, I asked her if she wanted to meet up, and she replied a month later. She said she just forgot. Sometimes, I find myself thinking: “OK, I’m going to wait five days to get back to Mandy.” But I know that’s not healthy.Mandy says she feels overwhelmed by notifications, which I do get. But, if I send a voice note to update her and ask how she is, and she takes two weeks to reply, it’s hard to keep up. Things have moved on by the time she’s replied. I mentioned this to her and she agrees, but says it takes effort. I know she’s busy with work, but so am I. And she works largely at home, whereas I’m in an office.When we do call or meet up, it’s great and we laugh like old times, but it’s getting harder to arrange. I just want her to treat my communication the same way I treat hers: as a priority.The defence: MandyI see a text and think, ‘I’ll reply later when I have time’, then just forget. I’m not brushing Priya offEveryone tells me how bad I am with my phone. I will be texting my boyfriend about something and then put my phone down and just forget because I need to reply to an email or make coffee. I think I have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.With Priya it’s the same, so I tell her not to take it personally. We’ve been friends since university, and lived together for years in London. Now, I’ve moved to Manchester, and she’s pregnant, so life has changed a lot. Friendships become difficult as you get into your 30s, but I know that taking a month to respond makes it harder still. I genuinely don’t mean to. I just get overwhelmed with messages.Yes, like everyone I’m on my phone a lot, but that doesn’t mean I’m emotionally available to have a conversation at that moment. My phone isn’t just for texting – it’s where I manage work, check emails and sometimes just decompress. Scrolling through social media doesn’t require the same energy as responding to a message, especially one from Priya, because I want to reply thoughtfully.I’m on my phone a lot, but that doesn’t mean I’m emotionally available to have a conversationI know she thinks I’m brushing her off, but it’s not about her, it’s about me. As an architect, my phone is always buzzing with work notifications. Sometimes, I see a text and think, “I’ll reply later when I have time”, and then I forget. It’s not intentional. It’s just how my brain works when I’m juggling 100 things at once.I know Priya thinks that because I don’t have kids, I don’t have an excuse. She’s pregnant and also working a lot, but she’s just better at managing messages than me.I got worse at communicating during Covid, as there was just too much noise on my phone. Then, in 2022, I moved to Manchester with my boyfriend, and there was a physical distance between me and Priya. Friendships take work, but I actually think phones and texting can make us all feel mad. I look forward to putting plans in the diary and having calls. Messages aren’t for me.I tell Priya: “If it’s urgent, call me!” Sometimes I assume it’s not urgent if it’s just a text. And if I really am taking too long, she should send me a follow-up – I won’t be annoyed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Mandy should have a long think about whether she wants close friends or not, because this isn’t the way to keep them.Sam, 63It’s OK not to message friends constantly – lots of people struggle with it, me included. With my best friend, it’s not the quantity of texts and chats that matters, but the quality. They should try to find a way of communicating that works for them both.Georgia, 28I appreciate what Mandy says about having the emotional energy to reply, but friendship is a two-way street and she needs to put some effort in. Priya isn’t her PA and shouldn’t be expected to chase her all the time.Ben, 32If Mandy is on her phone already and scrolling on Instagram, then ignoring Priya is a kick in the teeth. The bottom line is that Priya just isn’t Mandy’s priority. If I was Priya, I’d go and find a new best friend.Molly, 33Priya should take it easy and respect Mandy’s differing priorities, as demands on our time increase when we enter our 30s. If Priya takes a step back, their friendship may become more balanced. But if she feels she needs more attentive friends, then perhaps she’d be better off investing her time and emotions in other relationships which match her needs more closely.Cameron, 49Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: should Mandy be speedier in responding?The poll closes on Thursday 17 April at 10am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherAhmed should stop spitting in public.99%of you said yes –Ahmed is guilty1%of you said no –Ahmed is not guiltyExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On the hardest day I was up to my knees in snow. That tested my resilienceKaren KyllesøFri 11 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 06.30 EDTShareGrowing up in Norway, I had heard a lot about polar exploration, including how Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen was the first person to reach the south pole in 1911. As a child I spent a lot of time outdoors – building bonfires, camping and skiing in the mountains.Aged 14, seven years before my south pole expedition, I decided I wanted to become the youngest woman to ski across Greenland. I’m just under 5ft tall, and people are still shocked that I’m a polar explorer. When I became interested in skiing across Greenland, several guiding companies were unwilling to take me because I was so young. Then I met Lars Ebbesen, an experienced polar guide. Straight away, I felt he respected my ambitions.I had to go on an expedition to Finnmark first – a county in northern Norway – to prove I was capable. It was dark and cold – temperatures dropped as low as -35C, but I fell in love with it. Crossing Greenland itself took 28 days because we had very bad weather. At one point, we couldn’t leave our tent for three days. When our guide went outside to dig snow away from the tent walls, we had to hold him with a rope because the winds were so strong.I wasn’t scared, which I think was a little naive. The others on the expedition have since told me that they were very afraid and wondering how to protect me if the tent blew away. I was 14; the next oldest person was the guide, who was 30. I really grew up during that time. My mum says she can’t remember me being a teenager.It was on my 15th birthday that I decided to go to Antarctica. I didn’t tell my mum about my plans at first. I just told my dad – he’s like me, a big dreamer. My mum is more pragmatic.My dad and I contacted Lars to work out the logistics. When I told my mum, she realised I had already made up my mind. My parents are great role models – a lot of parents tell their children to wait until they’re older to explore their dreams. But if you wait too long you’ll have other commitments.View image in fullscreenA selfie in her tent.Photograph: Karen KyllesøWhen I began the expedition last November, I was 21. Pierre Hedan, the last person to break the record, was 26 when he arrived in January 2024.The journey is 1,130km: from Hercules Inlet, on the edge of the Antarctic continent, to the geographic south pole. I had to increase my body weight by 10% to be able to pull the supplies on my sledge, so I did a lot of strength training to gain muscle. In the two months before leaving, I often ate two dinners, lots of ice-cream and chocolate pudding. Because of my height, I found it hard to find expedition clothing that fitted me. Buta companyin London made a suit that was perfect.To prepare, I spoke to former polar explorers, watched documentaries and read every book on the subject. To keep me occupied on the trip, I had podcasts and music – my brother made me a playlist with everything from Norwegian house party music to the Beatles. But, the further I went, the more I enjoyed just experiencing the silence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

On the hardest days, I was in fresh snow up to my knees and could only go 9.5km in 10 hours. That tested my resilience. Then, when I arrived on the plateau 2,800m above sea level, I really felt the thin and cold air affecting my lungs. Towards the end, my lungs were painful, and I struggled to breathe.Before finishing, I didn’t allow myself to feel much, because I had to be focused. So when I arrived, 54 days after setting out, it was fantastic to revel in what I had achieved, though I also felt a slight emptiness because my life for so long had been about planning this project. In January, I received official accreditation from Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions confirming I had broken the record.When I crossed Greenland, Lars nicknamed me “the polar egg”. The idea was that one day I would hatch and do a bigger expedition on my own. When I reached the south pole I sent him an emoji of a chick emerging from an egg. Though with everything I’ve experienced I feel much older than that.As told to Rachel HalliburtonDo you have an experience to share?

It’s simple.

Her ingenious bar, filled with crunchykataifipastry and a luscious pistachio cream, took the internet by storm with its well-balanced flavour combination and addictive texture. I’ve skipped ready-made pistachio cream in favour of a homemade blend, which is free from artificial colours and flavours, and if you can’t find kataifi pastry (it’s normally available fresh in international supermarkets), Shredded Wheat makes an excellent substitute. The result is a luxurious, crunchy treat that’s perfect for sharing – it stores well, too.Crunchy pistachio chocolate barView image in fullscreenPrep10 minCook1 hrChill3 hr 30 min+Makes1 largebar, to serve 6Use the best-quality chocolate you can get your hands on. You will need a deep,two-piece silicone chocolate bar mould.75g kataifi pastry, or Shredded Wheat180g dark chocolate, or milk chocolate, if you prefer, chopped10g coconut oil60g pistachios, shelled180g white chocolate, choppedA large pinch ofsea salt30g tahiniRoughly chop the pastry into small pieces, then transfer to a baking tray in an even single layer. Bake at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for 35 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes, until golden all over, then remove and leave to cool.Put the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water, and heat gently until it’s nearly melted. Add the coconut oil, then take off the heat and stir until fully melted. Set aside to cool slightly.For the filling, blend the pistachios in a food processor until clumpy and just starting to release their oils (you don’t want a paste, though).Put the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of gently simmering water until nearly melted. Take off the heat, stir until fully melted, then mix in in the salt, tahini and pistachios. Mix until it turns green and homogeneous, then stir in the crisp pastry.To assemble, use three-quarters of the melted dark chocolate to coat the inside of a deep two-piece silicone chocolate bar mould, making sure that it is filled deeply enough that the bar will be stable. Put the mould in the fridge for 20–30 minutes, until the chocolate looks dull and set.Spoon the pistachio filling into the mould, leaving a small gap at the top, then return it to the fridge for an hour.Melt the remaining chocolate again, if necessary, then pour it all over the filling, levelling the top with a spatula to neaten and seal. Refrigerate for at least two hours, or overnight, until fully set, then carefully unmould. Keep refrigerated and consume within a few days. The bar should be served cold, because the chocolate is not tempered.Explore more on these topicsEasterThe sweet spotMiddle Eastern food and drinkBakingFoodPastryDessertSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"

They rise to 70ft (21 metres), tilt forward and zip away in different directions, each carrying a paper bag.On a sleepy morning in the Irish capital the takeoffs build to a steady one every few minutes, with barely anyone glancing at the constant stream of aircraft buzzing back and forth.“No one’s looking up – no one ever looks up,” says the man responsible, Bobby Healy, the founder of the Dublin startup Manna Aero.People probably should take notice, because the drones are part of an effort to realise an ambition shared byAmazon, the Google sister company Wing and the Californian startup Zipline: instant, autonomous home delivery. Healy and his big-tech rivals hope drone delivery will change the course of the retail industry across Ireland, and then into the UK as soon as this year.Drones have already made a huge impact on things ranging from photography to light shows, humanitarian missions to thewar in Ukraine. The promise is obvious: skip terrestrial congestion. However, the companies now have to persuade investors and the public. Previous Wingtrials in Australia faced public opposition.View image in fullscreen‘In suburbs that delivery driver thing is a broken model,’ says Manna Aero’s founder, Bobby Healy.Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The GuardianAmazon is operating in Texas, Arizona and Italy, and is seeking permission to fly drones from warehouses in England, whileWing is already operating in several countries. Yet Manna Aero appears to be right in the mix. It has flown 200,000 delivery flights in the Dublin suburb of Blanchardstown, as well as in Helsinki, Finland. Deals with Just Eat and DoorDash could help as it to expand and attract businesses ranging from restaurants, tool stores and bookshops.On Manna’s app the Guardian orders two coffees to be delivered to a borrowed house. A speck on the horizon gradually resolves itself into a quadcopter as it skims over the Dublin suburban skyline. It approaches the garden, hovers momentarily, and then drops the paper bag on a biodegradable string. The drone flies off, leaving two warm, unspilled coffees.The coffees arrived 16 minutes after we put in the order on the app, including time for preparation. That compares with preparation time plus a minimum of 11 minutes for someone delivering the same on an e-bike.Crucially though, the drones do not need to lug around a human, meaning they use less energy, Healy says. Each aircraft does about 80 deliveries a day, he says – well over double what a delivery driver or rider would generally do. On top of that, a drone “pilot” is able to oversee up to 20 aircraft at once, Healy adds.View image in fullscreenAutonomous drones mean fewer people are needed. The ‘pilot’ is able to oversee up to 20 aircraft at once, says Manna’s CEO.Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The GuardianAutonomous dronesThe drones are autonomous from the point that they are loaded and given the OK to lift off from the base. Six minutes later, on average, the drones arrive at the house, and hover above the garden. The only intervention from a pilot is when a video flicks on back at the base to check whether the ground is clear of people or cars.“In suburbs that delivery driver thing is a broken model,” says Healy. “There’s no way you can get a delivery driver to do that and make it profitable.”Healy, a Dubliner, describes himself as a “tech guy”. He left school at 17 to make video games and then started and sold six businesses, most recently CarTrawler, which operates vehicle rental services for airline websites. He founded Manna in 2018 because he wanted to make “measurable impact planet-wide”, bringing coders with him to take on the challenge of creating autonomous drones.The drones were designed by Manna’s teams in Monmouth, Wales, and Dublin, with aerospace-grade parts made mostly in China. Each one weighs 23kg (51lb), including up to 4kg of cargo, a weight that will allow them to fly in the US.View image in fullscreenManna’s drones can carry cargo weighing up to 4kg, enough to carry four 15-inch pizzas.Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The GuardianThat is easily enough to carry four 15-inch pizzas for a family, or transport several books, although “volume is harder than weight”. One delivery of 24 toilet rolls in Finland had to be halved because they would not all fit. “Must have been an emergency,” says Healy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is also an inbuilt parachute, although that has only been used once in 200,000 flights over four years, and European aerospace regulators have audited the company’s tech.The drones operate from bases squeezed in bits of land that can fit a couple of shipping containers and five 2 metre squaredlanding zones. Manna employees in the containers prepare the orders, charge the batteries, which are swapped out after each flight, and oversee the drops in a 2.1-mile (3.4km) circle.Expansion plansManna’s catchment area covers 150,000 people in Blanchardstown. By the end of the year, the company expects to cover about a million people across Dublin. That would be most of the city outside the centre, where shorter distances and fewer private gardens for drops rule out Manna for now. (City centre rooftop deliveries hold promise, but the idea of deliveries to flats on the fourth floor seems unlikely, Healy says.) By the end of the year Healy hopes to be at a rate of 2m flights annually.View image in fullscreenManna has flown 200,000 delivery flights in the Dublin suburb of Blanchardstown and in Helsinki, Finland.Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The GuardianHealy says the UK launch has beenheld up by regulation, although the adoption of EU drone standards on 1 April could open the door as soon as this year, or “definitely” 2026. Customers in Ireland pay a €1.99 (£1.73) delivery fee, but Healy pledges that deliveries will be free for users when the service starts in unnamed UK cities. Businesses will instead pay a commission.Manna still has a lot of obstacles ahead. Each flight is profitable now, but the cost of expansion will still be high for the loss-making company. It has done everything so far on a shoestring €60m in venture capital money, with Coca-Cola and Patrick Collison, the founder of the fintech firm Stripe, on board as investors.Healy also knows that some people will balk at the idea of instant retail gratification. Birds know to keep away, but the company may in the future have to solve the problem of avoiding rival operators’ aircraft.Yet Healy is ebullient about the future of drone deliveries.“It will enable a totally different form of commerce to what we have today,” he says. “People in small businesses beating the giants.

The trip was so brief he didn’t even pack a laptop charger.The Australian says he was detained and deported when returning from the memorial in March, despite holding a working visa still valid for more than a year. He has been living on the US east coast for the better part of a decade – where his American partner, apartment, work studio and clients remain.Jonathan, who spoke on the condition his real name was not disclosed, says he is now couch surfing in Australia, separated from his “whole life”.The Guardian view on the US immigration crackdown: what began with foreign nationals won’t end there | EditorialRead moreThe situation, he says, is “a bit disastrous”.The disaster began at border control in transit in Houston, Texas, when he was pulled aside and taken to a “secondary” room, he says. Posters hanging on the walls that had once celebrated diversity, equity and inclusion, had been crudely updated with a black marker pen, with mentions of DEI scribbled out. About 100 people from around the world sat and lay in various states of worry and exhaustion, he says.“There were so many people in this room. A heavy percentage of them were from South America. I met a girl from Berlin. There were a bunch of people from Canada. There were two Brits.”After about half an hour, he says, his name was called out. He was asked if he wanted to call the Australian consulate, but declined.Part of me wants to go back, part of me is doneJonathan“I thought I was just going to be given my passport and sent on my way, or maybe asked a couple of questions, but they made some pretty outlandish accusations. They said, ‘We know you have two mobile phones. We’ve been tracking your calls. We know you’ve been selling drugs’.”He says he told the border officer he did not drink, smoke or take drugs and owned just one phone. He was asked for his passcode.“That didn’t sound right. I asked to talk to a lawyer and they told me I had no rights.” He says he was given a brochure explaining that he must surrender his phone and so handed it over, along with his smartwatch.He says things “seemed really fucking weird” but he was careful to remain “overly polite”. He says when he asked the officer to repeat a comment he hadn’t heard, the man replied: “Are you deaf or just retarded?”‘You live here, do you?’Back in the secondary room, several families sat to one side in a family room beside cots, he says. People vied for half a dozen recliner seats. After about five or six hours, he was called into an interview room by a different officer.He says the interview“went round and round in circles”.Australian comedian ditches US trip due to concern she could be denied entry over Trump jokesRead more“He suggested I was working for people I shouldn’t have been working for.”Jonathan says the official suggested he was carrying human remains and sent for Centers for Disease Control agents to assess the empty ashes urn. He says when he explained he had been living in the US for more than five years, he was asked: “Oh you live here, do you?”Jonathan says: “Then he told me I didn’t have the right visa – apparently saying I lived there showed that I had intent to stay and not leave.”He says his visa was still valid for more than 12 months and he had left and re-entered the US without any problems about 20 times holding the same class of visa.He says that over a series of short interviews amounting to about half an hour, the official told him his visa had been cancelled and that he was banned from entering the US for five years, including as a transit passenger. He was told he would be placed on a flight to Australia and was handed a document informing him that he was an “immigrant not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa” as required by the Immigration and Nationality Act. He says he felt he had no choice but to sign the document, which Guardian Australia has seen.He says the official then told him: “Trump is back in town; we’re doing things the way we should have always been doing them.”Jonathan says he was told he could ask to speak to the man’s boss, who, he was warned, usually “didn’t have much to say”. He says the boss pointed to the official and told Jonathan: “Whatever he said.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just before boarding – he was the first passenger on to the plane – he was passed an envelope containing his phone and watch. His passport was handed to him shortly before landing.String of casesBack in Australia, he is still searching for answers.“They didn’t give me any valid reasons for cancelling my visa. I’ve spoken to a bunch of lawyers and they all say I could fight it but that it would cost thousands and probably take five years anyway.”He says he has been told he can apply for a new visa, but that he would need to get a waiver to do so.“Even if they recommend me for a waiver, it goes through Homeland Security and they are under a directive to not let people back in who have been kicked out,” he says.After what he describes as “an awful time” – punctuated by an injury, his sister’s death and his deportation, in quick succession – he is now living in limbo.Deported over a speeding ticket?

I brought enough clothes with me for two days – my entire life is there,” he says.Jonathan’s girlfriend, who also asked not to be named, said she was “devastated” by the turn of events. When the time of his arrival came and went, she “started to get a sinking feeling”, she said via email from the US.“My thoughts went to whether or not the plane went down. We had just finished a call before he boarded the flight back to [the US] and I hadn’t gotten any updates.“Finally after being held for over 36 hours with no phone, he delivered the news that he was being sent back.“We live together and while I can’t get time away from work right this second, all I want is to be reunited with him as soon as possible.”She said she was doing her best to manage her anxiety and support her partner from afar.“I am choosing hope and working hard to overcome the many obstacles that this administration has put in our path. Our plan is to start a family after all.“Others have been having similar experiences and my hope is that they don’t feel like they’re alone in their struggles,” she said.Jonathan’s experience reflects a spate of similar border horror stories in recent months. In February,British tourist Rebecca Burkewas stopped, interrogated and branded an illegal alien by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) division when attempting to leave the US. GermansLucas Sielaff,Fabian SchmidtandJessica Bröschewere all detained upon entering the US. A Canadian, Jasmine Mooney,said she was detained by Icefor nearly two weeks and deported, despite having a work visa.Guardian Australia contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment without revealing any identifying details about Jonathan, explaining that he did not consent to having his name disclosed in order not to jeopardise any future appeals.Guardian Australia asked “what grounds would be reasonable for someone to be denied entry to the US when they have a valid work visa” and whether it was “considered acceptable for any traveller to be called a ‘retard’ by US border officials”.A Department of Homeland Security media representative replied that the department “cannot answer questions on something we cannot verify the veracity of”.“Just like I cannot confirm the existence of big foot.”Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will release data detailing consular assistance to Australians in the US for the period covering the start of Trump’s second term in late 2025.Australia’s Smartraveller websiteadvises visitors to the USthat a valid visa “doesn’t guarantee entry to the United States”.“Authorities have broad powers when deciding if you’re eligible to enter and may determine that you are inadmissible for any reason under US law,” it states.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

And Sanchez was not only able to finish college, but enroll in nursing school. With a scholarship that covered her tuition and free childcare, Sanchez could afford to commute to school, buy groceries for her growing family – even after she had two more children – and pay down the family’s mortgage and car loan.“We are a one-income household,” said Sanchez, whose husband works while she is in school. Having free childcare “did help tremendously”.View image in fullscreenGiovanni Aguilar, three, and pre-K students listening to a story read by Brenda Soria, pre-k teacher in Albuquerque on 27 March 2025.Photograph: Isabel Miranda/The GuardianAround the same time, Ofelia Gonzalez and her sister began receiving assistance from the state to develop their at-home childcare center in south-western Albuquerque, called Mis Conejitos. The state started reimbursing their work at higher rates, which allowed them to buy toys and swings for the backyard, and raised wages for childcare workers across the state, which allowed Gonzalez to begin saving “so that I can have good credit and in time I can have my own home”, she said in Spanish.The changes in Sanchez and Gonzalez’s lives are intertwined. Three years ago, New Mexico became the first state in the nationto offer free childcareto a majority of families. The United States has no federal, universal childcare – and ranks 40th ona Unicef rankingof 41 high-income countries’ childcare policies, while maintaining some ofthe highest childcare costsin the world. Expanding on pandemic-era assistance, New Mexico made childcare free for families earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level, or about $124,000 for a family of four. That meant about half of New Mexican children now qualified.In one of the poorest states in the nation, wherethe median household income is half thatand childcare costs for two children couldtake up 80% of a family’s income, the impact was powerful. The state, which had long ranked worst in the nation for child wellbeing, saw its poverty rate begin to fall.View image in fullscreenPortrait of Ofelia Gonzalez, director at Mis Conejitos in Albuquerque.Photograph: Isabel Miranda/The GuardianAs the state simultaneously raised wages for childcare workers, and became thefirstto base its subsidy reimbursement rates on the actual cost of providing such care, early childhood educators were also raised out of poverty. In 2020,27.4%of childcare providers – often women of color – were living in poverty. By 2024, that number hadfallen to 16%.During the state’s recent legislative session, lawmakers approveda “historic” increasein funding for education, including early childhood education, that might improve those numbers even further.“This is a big investment that we know is going to pay off,” said Elizabeth Groginsky, cabinet secretary of New Mexico’s nascent early childhood education and care department. She points toresearchfrom the Nobel-winning economist James Heckman that “every dollar spent on high-quality, birth-to-five programs for disadvantaged children can deliver a 13% per annum return on investment from better education and health outcomes for children, employment gains for parents, greater economic productivity and reduced spending on healthcare and crime.“The governor has seen that this investment in our human capital is as important as all the investments we’re making in our infrastructure,” said Groginsky.Despite the fact that widespread poverty has kept the state’s child wellbeing rates low, “New Mexico had, almost from statehood, a real culture around caring for children,” said Hailey Heinz, a senior research scientist and deputy director of the University of New Mexico’s Cradle to Career Policy Institute.View image in fullscreenPre-K students doing movement exercises at Mis Conejitos in Albuquerque.Photograph: Isabel Miranda/The GuardianBoth Republican and Democratic administrations have never been “particularly stingy with the social safety net”, she said, citing the Democratic lieutenant governor, Diane Denish, who led efforts to offerfree pre-kindergartento all the state’s four-year-olds in 2005, and the Republican governor, Susana Martinez, whoexpanded Medicaidin 2013.After Medicaid was expanded in the state, a coalition of community groups came together to advocate for the next policy they thought could advance child wellbeing: universal childcare.When now-governor Michelle Lujan Grishamannounced her candidacyin late 2016, she emphasized her desire to address the state’s low child wellbeing rating. And when she took office in January 2018, she described her aim to have a “moonshot for education”: major investments in education across the state, fromearly childhoodthroughcollege.That led to her opening the state’searly childhood education and care departmentin 2019 – and tapping Groginksy, who had overseen efforts toimprove early childhood policiesin Washington DC, to run it. Then, in 2020, Lujan Grisham threw her support behind a bill in the state legislature that would establish an Early Childhood Trust Fund: by investing $300m – plus budget surpluses each year,largely from oil and gasrevenue – the state hoped to distribute a percentage to fund early childhood education each year.But then, just weeks after the trust fund was established, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic.“Covid created a really enormous moment for childcare,” said Heinz. “We had somewhat of a national reckoning about the fact that we don’t have a workforce if we don’t have childcare.”As federal funding flooded into New Mexico, the statedirected millions of dollarstoward childcare, including byboosting payfor entry-level childcare providers to $15 an hour,expanding eligibilityfor free childcare to families making 400% of the poverty level, and becoming the first state in the nationto set childcare subsidy ratesat the true cost of delivering care.“The governor saw this as an opportunity to accelerate and advance her agenda for children and families because we had the relief money,” said Groginsky.View image in fullscreenPre-K students having lunch at Mis Conejitos.Photograph: Isabel Miranda/The GuardianView image in fullscreenOfelia Gonzalez, director at Mis Conejitos preparing enchiladas for lunch.Photograph: Isabel Miranda/The GuardianAs pandemic-era relief funding dried up in 2022, the governor and Democratic lawmakers proposed another way to generate funds for childcare – directing a portion of the state’sLand Grant Permanent Fundto early childhood education and care. Like the Early Childhood Trust Fund, the permanent fund – which was established when New Mexico became a state – was funded by taxes on fossil fuel revenues. That November,70% of New Mexican votersapproved a constitutional amendment directing 1.25% of the fund to early childhood programs.By then, the Early Childhood Trust Fund had grown exponentially – due to the boom in oil and gas prices. Beginning with $300m in 2020, the fund had swollen toover $9bnby the end of 2024.View image in fullscreenBrenda Soria, pre-K teacher and Christian Reyes, four, playing with playdough during recess at Mis Conejitos.Photograph: Isabel Miranda/The GuardianView image in fullscreenDafne Duran, four, doing a drawing activity at Mis Conejitos daycare in Albuquerque.Photograph: Isabel Miranda/The GuardianThesecond greatest oil- and gas-producing statein the US, much of New Mexico’s state budget comes from fossil fuels.“It’s the blessing and curse of living in New Mexico,” said Gabrielle Uballez, executive director of NM Voices forChildren. But while oil and gas is booming, she says advocates hope to “take advantage of that so that kids and families are benefiting – not the oil and gas industry by itself, and not corporations by itself”.New Mexico has long had one of the highest “official poverty rates” in the nation.But using a metric that accounts for social safety net programs – like universal childcare – that’s slowly shifting. According to “supplemental poverty” data, 17.1% of New Mexicans fell below the federal “supplemental” poverty line from 2013 to 2015 (a metric that takes into account cost of living and social supports) – making it the fifth poorest state in the nation by that measure. But today, that number has fallen to 10.9%,one of the biggest changes in the country, amounting to 120,000 fewer New Mexicans living in poverty.New Mexico’schild wellbeingranking – which is based heavily on “official poverty” rankings – probably won’t budge, says Heinz because “the amount of money coming into households, that they have to run their budget, remains very low.“However, the thing New Mexico has done that’s fairly tremendous, I think, is around families not having to have as much money going out,” she said.During the recent legislative session, lawmakers deepened their investments in early childhood education even further, approving a 21.6% increase of $170m for education programs – including early childhood education. However, other legislation that advocates had hoped might pass stalled in the legislature, including a bill to require businesses to offer paid family medical leave.View image in fullscreenPre-K students playing games during recess with Brenda Soria, teacher, and Sofia Quezada, caretaker, in Albuquerque.Photograph: Isabel Miranda/The GuardianIn herbudget recommendations, Lujan Grisham asked the state to up its commitment to early childhood policies, by raising the wage floor for childcare workers to $18 an hour and establishing a career lattice for them. Because of that, Gonzalez has been able to start working on her associate’s in childhood education at Central New Mexico Community College where her tuition is waived. The governor also backed a house bill that will increase the amount of money distributed annually from the Early Childhood Trust Fund – since its dramatic growth due to oil and gas revenues.Although funding childcare through the Land Grant Permanent Fund is unique to New Mexico – and a handful of other states with permanent funds, like Alaska, Texas and North Dakota – Heinz says the Early Childhood Trust fund “holds interesting lessons for other states” about investing a percentage of revenues into early childhood programs.In New Mexico, those revenues come largely from oil and gas, but New Mexico Voices for Children has put forthrecommendationsabout how the state can continue funding childcare while transitioning away from fossil fuels, largely by raising taxes on the state’s wealthiest earners. Although other states have not yet followed in New Mexico’s footsteps, a growing number are making strides to offerfree pre-Kto a majority of their residents.Heinz cautions that change won’t occur overnight. “What New Mexico is trying to do here is play a very long game. And so I am not without worry that people might give it five years, and it’s been almost five years now, and then say, where are the results? Why is everything not better?” she said. “This is generational change” that New Mexico is only just beginning to witness as the first children who were recipients of universal childcare start school.Sanchez urges other New Mexican families to take advantage of the opportunity to access free childcare.“Being able to work for free or go to school for free, that can make a big difference in your life and your children’s – everybody’s – life.”Explore more on these topicsNew MexicoUnequal beginningsChildcareChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Overnight, US President Donald Trump hadreversed course, announcing a 90-day pause on his so-called “reciprocal tariffs” of up to 50% for dozens of countries. Although China got no such reprieve – instead, the levy on Chinese goods was increased to 145% – the temporary return of normal trade channels showed Chinese businesspeople that all was not lost.Trump’s announcement of punitive tariffs on countries across south-east Asia had risked closing off the routes that Chinese companies have been using since his first term in office to circumvent his levies.Will Trump’s tariff chaos be China’s gain in global trade wars?Read moreSince 2017, thanks to tariffs on Chinese goods, the share of China’s exports bound for the US has dropped from about 20% to less than 15%. But much of that trade has simply been re-routed through third countries, as Chinese firms set up shop in places with cheaper labour costs and easier access to the US market.Chinese foreign direct investment in Asean countries reached $24bn in 2023, up from less than $10bn in 2017. Several of China’s major solar companies have shifted manufacturing to south-east Asia. So despite the fact that “made in China” solar panels are virtually nonexistent in the US market,80% of the US’s solar panelscome from Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand. Next week, President Xi Jinping will visit Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia, on his first official foreign trip this year.Hobbling those countries’ ability to export to the US would inflict more true economic pain on Chinese companies than bilateral tariffs ever could. So in Shanghai, China’s commercial capital, a return to anarrowly US-China trade war, while still unwelcome, is some comfort.But on the ideological front, the mood in China is hardening over Trump’s imposition of 145% tariffs. State media and the foreign ministry have been sharing a clip of the former US president Ronald Reagan decrying tariffs in 1987. On X, foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning has been trolling the US, posting a meme of a Make America Great Again baseball cap increasing in price from $50 to $77.The most telling propaganda has been the resurfacing of a video clip of former Chinese leader Mao Zedong from 1953. “As to how long this war will last, we are not the ones who can decide,” Mao says. “No matter how long this war is going to last, we will never yield,” he says to applause.‘We will have to raise prices’: gloom and resolve in Yiwu, on China’s trade war frontlineRead moreMao was referring to the Korean war, a conflict which is remembered in China as a time when China successfully stood up to the US through China’s support of North Korea. But in 2025, the combative rhetoric is being applied to the trade war, in which China has vowed to “fight to the end”. With suggestions from influential commentators that China mightsuspend cooperation with the US on fentanyl controlas a retaliation for the tariffs, some are comparing the present moment to the Opium Wars, which were fought over an unsavoury mix of addictive opiates and anger about trade imbalances – just like in 2025.Ren Yi, an influential commentator who writes under the name Chairman Rabbit, wrote on Thursday: “The trade war is a war of public opinion, public sentiment, and information … China should adopt a ‘wartime’ state of tension in terms of public opinion, and all sectors should move in one direction and one goal. This issue is by no means a joke.”There is an ominous sense that the US-China relationship could still get worse. On Thursday, in a largely symbolic move, China said it wouldrestrict the importof Hollywood movies. China’s tariffs on US goods were increased on Fridayto 125%. Six US companies have been added to Beijing’s list of “unreliable entities”, restricting their ability to do business in China.Discussion on Chinese social media, massaged by censors to ensure only the most nationalist comments are prominent, are full of defiance and bombast. One meme joked that Trump’s new slogan should be “MCGA” – Making China Great Again.But some commentators have warned against rampant nationalism on the Chinese side. In a recent essay published in Chinese media, Zheng Yongnian, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in Shenzhen, wrote: “We must not underestimate the vitality of American society. The vitality of the United States has never been in the government, but in society and capital.“There are still a large number of people in domestic media, especially social media, who feel that they have ‘won’,” Zheng wrote. “This is very dangerous. If this happens, we will be confused by the west … and in the end will make strategic mistakes.”Offline, some fear, that without the linchpin of trade keeping the US and China on co-operative terms, the reasons for avoiding more dangerous conflicts, such as war in the Taiwan Strait or the South China Sea, are becoming less compelling.Explore more on these topicsChinaTariffsAsia PacificDonald TrumpTrump tariffsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Despite following ancient traditions painters now also draw inspiration from Google ImagesThe oldest surviving Ethiopian manuscripts are the Garima Gospels, a set of two illuminated texts, brightly decorated with purple, green and blue paintings and written in about AD500. Today they are closely guarded by monks at the Abba Garima monastery in a remote part of Ethiopia’s mountainous Tigray region. Dozens of other churches in northern Ethiopia, many of them cut into rocky mountainsides, hold manuscripts that are also more than 1,000 years old.The manuscripts produced by the Addis Ababa workshop, run by the Hamere Berhan Institute, could last just as long. “I hope, in 1,000 years, or more, people will find the books I wrote,” says Dawit Fantaye, who is writing a life of St George, a key figure in Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity.“For that reason, our work has to be perfect.”View image in fullscreenBlack inks are mixed from soil, barley water and crushed leaves, while red inks are enriched with wax from acacia treesThe workshop follows ancient methods, but with modern touches. It mixes black ink from soil, barley water and crushed leaves. The red ink and the paints are store-bought, but enriched with wax from acacia trees. The writers copy their texts from cheaply printed paper books, while the painters draw inspiration from Google Images.Each year, the institute gets through 3,500 goat skins, which are donated by locals after they slaughter animals on feast days. These are cured, scrubbed clean and dried on metal frames at another site on the southern edge of Addis Ababa, over which the smell of the skins hangs heavily.Since it was founded seven years ago, the Hamere Berhan Institute has produced about 315 manuscripts. They are made to order, but lately the institute has struggled to get them to customers. Many of these are religious institutions in regionsbeset by conflict, such as AmharaandOromia, Ethiopia’s two most-populous states.View image in fullscreenIllustrations are an important to convey messages for people who cannot readAs a result, about a dozen completed, red leather-bound volumes sit in a cabinet at the back of the workshop, waiting to be shipped.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The writers at the institute work 12-hour shifts, six days a week. They write in a dead language, which is not spoken outside church services and has a complex verb system. Just writing the word “God” in Ge’ez takes about one minute, says Dawit, a 25-year-old who spent 10 years studying calligraphy at a monastery.View image in fullscreenWorkers scrub, clean and dry goatskins at Hamere Berhan’s site on the edge of Addis Ababa“It takes a lot of concentration and effort, but I enjoy it.

In truth, Borgnine didn’t get his start as a screen actor until his early-to-mid 30s, having spent his young adulthood serving in the navy after high school and re-enlisting after the attack on Pearl Harbor. With his stocky figure and boisterous gap-toothed grin, Borgnine had no conventional leading-man qualities, yet his unique magnetism made him an unlikely star, someone who could play tough guys or working stiffs with broad relatability. He was the people’s star.The Sound of Music at 60: a flawed but enduring cultural touchpointRead moreBorgnine hadn’t been in movies very long when he took the title role in Marty as a pug-ugly butcher who’s 34, still lives with his widowed mother in The Bronx and has all but given up on the prospect of marriage. To say the part resonated with viewers would be a understatement: Marty won both the first-ever Palme d’Or and best picture Oscar, and Borgnine won best actor for a performance that spoke (and still speaks) to the yearning of lonely souls who have a lot of love to give, but need someone to discover it. There’s a sweaty earnestness to Borgnine here that’s completely winning, because he’s incapable of playing it cool or disguising his inexperience. He can only be himself.Scripted by Paddy Chayefsky – he also won an Oscar, and added two more later with The Hospital and Network – Marty was a teleplay before it became a movie, and it emphasizes much of the grimy naturalism brought to TV in the early 50s. Stripping away the gloss of studio productions, director Delbert Mann brought the action out into the open as much as possible, with real Bronx locations that underlined the modesty and insularity of his hero’s world. The year 1955 was quietly one of the greatest years in film history –according to me, anyway– and Marty was part of a transition in screen realism, with Borgnine making his own contribution while James Dean was galvanizing audiences with Rebel Without a Cause and East of Eden. He was the opposite of a matinee idol.There’s an immediately touching affability to Borgnine’s Marty as he cheerfully greets customers at the butcher shop, despite nearly every one of them reminding him that he’s a loser for not being married. Two tell him he should be ashamed of himself and the abuse seems to wash over him like white noise, because he’s internalized it so deeply. When he and his buddy Angie (Joe Mantell), another hopeless case, talk about what to do on a Friday, it’s easier to retreat to another night sucking down beers in front of the television than face another round of rejections. It’s only after Marty’s married brother Tommy (Jerry Paris) suggests the Stardust Ballroom to their mother as a good meeting place that he’s goaded into trying again. (His mom’s encouraging pitch: “It’s loaded with tomatoes!”)Braced for another excruciating night of polite refusals, his fortunes shift at the Stardust when he discovers a figure who’s even shier and more pitiable than he is. Shortly after Clara (Betsy Blair), a plain-featured high school science teacher, arrives at the club on a blind date, Marty notices her crying alone at a table, abandoned by a smug bachelor who didn’t bother to hide his contempt for her. He asks her to dance and she obliges, and the two start having a conversation that’s remarkably intimate for a couple of strangers. Clara talks about a time when she came to the Stardust alone, sat in the same spot for an hour and a half without getting any attention, and then cried. “I cry a lot, too,” says Marty, sympathetically. “I’m a big crier.”The heartrending allure of the film is reflected in that exchange and the scenes that follow. Marty and Clara are socially inept, incapable of disguising their desires or vulnerabilities or suggesting some image of themselves that’s more glamorous than the real thing. Their relationship feels breathlessly accelerated, so much so that Clara refuses an awkward first kiss attempt from Marty because she’s too overwhelmed to process it. There’s almost a sense that they could get engaged that very same night if the people around them — the same sort of people shaming Marty for being single – weren’t discouraging him for seeing such “a dog”.View image in fullscreenA still of Ernest Borgnine and Joe Mantell in Marty.Photograph: Harold Hecht/Burt LancasterAround the edges of Marty, Chayevsky and Mann also give a generous amount of time to Esther Minciotti as Marty’s mother Teresa and Augusta Ciolli as his aunt, who’s become such a pill around Tommy, his wife and their toddler that Tommy is begging Teresa to take her sister away. Much like Tokyo Story from two years before, the older women are struggling to figure out their place among grown children who don’t necessarily want them around. Perhaps their Italian roots raised them with the expectation that they would always stay close to their immediate family, but US culture is telling something else.The smallness of Marty suits the man at its center, and it gives an underdog quality to the film itself, which wouldn’t seem to have the scale to win all the awards it did, much less be remembered so fondly 70 years later. But that same formula explains how Sylvester Stallone would triumph in 1976 withRocky, another story that hinges on the romance between a working-class brute and the shy, sweet-natured woman who draws his affection. Just as Rocky isn’t as formidable as the murderer’s row of classics it beat the Oscars (All the President’s Men, Network, Taxi Driver and Bound for Glory), Marty doesn’t tend to get the same respect as a work of art. It’ll just have settle for being loved.Explore more on these topicsErnest BorgnineDrama filmsComedy filmsRomance filmsOscarsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then a new relationship changed his concept of love. His radiant new album shares the revelationsByLaura SnapesFri 11 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 06.35 EDTShareJustin Vernon would rather not be doing any of this. Releasing a newBon Iveralbum, promoting it. He absolutely isn’t going to tour it. “I don’t need to do this any more,” he says. “I want to be done with this whole thing. But I am dead serious about these songs. That’s how much I care about them, that I’m going to do something I haven’t been comfortable with to put them out.”As soon as Vernon hit the public eye in 2008, he started pulling away from its obsessive glare – and from the caricature of him as the lonely woodsman who made his era-defining debut, For Emma Forever Ago, in a hunting cabin in his native Wisconsin. His sound grew cryptic and mutated, though he was no less popular for it. Kanye West and Taylor Swift wanted to collaborate. But anxious from the demands to flay himself for entertainment, he clouded his image. He intimated that he would retire, which only created more distorting attention. As Vernon puts out his first album in six years, he knows better than to make such declarations, though he “might peace out” after releasing Sable, Fable.If he is going to give these pivotal songs a chance, he wants to go all out. As well as an album, he’s selling a salmon-hued – to him, the colour of life – T-shirt bearing the image of a giant salmon, plus a tinned smoked salmon collaboration, and a fragrance (not salmon). “I’m not gonna hide my face any more,” he says. “I’m gonna be out here full-bore, full-scene. I wanna see how bad it feels.”It’s why the 43-year-old songwriter is sitting cross-legged on my sofa in north London in mid-March. He’s kicked off his “footies” – hand-sprayed in salmon – freeing the ankle he recently sprained playing basketball. Wearing a blue hoodie advertising a hometown brewery, he relays the dark and light of his past half-decade with dude-ish enthusiasm and ease.View image in fullscreenBon Iver performs during Lollapalooza 2009 in Chicago, Illinois.Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty ImagesSable, Fable documents a period when what had felt like irrevocable darkness became light. The Sable part arrived as a three-track EP last autumn: lovely, straightforwardly sad songs about hitting a wall. “I wanted to try to be basic,” says Vernon. The last of the three, Awards Season, is a pivot, as new love enters his life: “You can be remade,” he sings. The revelation invites the radiantly funky secular gospel of nine infatuated songs that make up the remaining Fable part of the album, made with Jim-E Stack and, often, Danielle Haim. The lyrics have strikingly simple repeated internal rhymes, like nesting dolls. “I just want it to feel good and feel happy,” says Vernon. “To have a song about sex where the only way to listen to it is tomoverather than be like, let me introspect.”Vernon wrote Everything Is Peaceful Love, Fable’s centrepiece, in 2019. It has a beautifully silly chorus that crests like a sunrise: “Damn if I’m not climbing up a tree right now!” – childish ecstasy meeting the fear of what you do once you get that high. “It was almost like, I feel so good I don’t know what to do,” says Vernon. He wanted to harness that mood. “We put it on the wall to see what else gathered around it.”The feeling was mostly aspirational. Then, the future really “looked like a brick wall that I didn’t have the mechanics to go around”, he says even‑handedly. “I didn’t have suicidal ideation, but I remember telling my therapist: if a bus hit me today that would be a fucking relief.”Vernon’s body had been “buzzing with anxiety for a dozen years”. After his massively successful debut, making 2011’s Grammy-winning followup Bon Iver, Bon Iver, was almost a lark. “It was so funny to me that we had blown up so hard. It was almost like I couldn’t lose, so I had all that courage: y’all are crazy. I’m gonna do a record where it starts out like metal and ends as 80s sex rock.”But by the time Vernon got to the symbol-laden22, A Millionin 2016, he was “struggling with not really having anything new to say”. Profound anxiety meant he cancelled a European tour: “I couldn’t even leave the house.” Performing drained him. “Not to say I’m special, but some of my music, you have to get downin thereto find the source, to actually speak the music,” he says. “That’s a mechanism like anything else. It breaks down and needs recuperation, and it just wasn’t getting enough.” He managed to “get back in the groove” for2019’s expansive i, i. His mental health was “patched together, and I loved the touring family so much”.The pandemic soon prompted Vernon to ask himself some “hard questions” about the future. He was back in the Wisconsin woods again, and wrote the incantatory Things Behind Things Behind Things. “I would like the feeling / I would like the feeling / I would like the feeling gone / Cause I don’t like the way it’s / I don’t like the way it’s / I don’t like the way it’s looking,” he sings. “It was like, this feeling sucks,” he says, dejected. “Kind of prayering it out, summoning it so that you could throw it in the wind and have it blow away like dust.”Still, Bon Iver got back on the road in 2022. “I was excited for about a week, then immediately started having this panic, exhaustion.” He felt trapped until the tour ended. In September 2023, he definitively sold or donated all his live gear: “If I didn’t, I was almost afraid that I could get pulled back into it accidentally.” He still felt unwell for another year.There was one immediate improvement: he attended a five-week programme to quit smoking. He had started in his mid-20s while working as a chef, which he hated. (Quitting that, and his then-band, brought Bon Iver into being.) It worked: Vernon replaced smoking with nicotine toothpicks, which he tweaks as we talk. It was another “big brick wall”, he says. But this time, “all the good parts of me kept going and all the shitty parts kind of hit that wall.”Smoking became a metaphor for other ways Vernon wanted to better himself. He asked: “What validation was I getting from being this sad, bruised boy? The attention came to me and of course I’m going to react, like: I’m worth it, or something. Then, subconsciously you steer towards a little more self-destruction.”View image in fullscreenThe colour of life … Vernon in his beloved salmon pink.Vernon questioned whether fame and his fried system had made him a “shithead”: a bad brother, boyfriend, friend. “I don’t really want to talk about Kanye,” he says – having worked onMy Beautiful Dark Twisted FantasyandYeezus, long before the rapper’s heel turn – “but it’s a good example of observing when people have their head up their ass a little bit, or they’re so busy, and so needed, that you start getting soft.”He concluded that his problems weren’t “that hard”. If touring was the problem, then “Juststop it,” he says. “I know there’s alotof pressure on you, but the answer is either yes or no, and if it’s no, you better get the fuck out of here because you can’t keep acting like this. I could see the quality of my character slowly diminishing from trying to be too much to too many people.” He believes the world needs more hard decisions. “My buddy Trevor says: ‘Hard decisions, easy life. Easy decisions, hard life.’”Vernon faced that scenario again with the new love he sings about in Awards Season. “I wasn’t feeling too good about myself, and this person made me feel really good about myself,” he says. “Like everything I had done to this point had been OK.” Then came the classic next step: “Let me just give you everything. I need that feeling. Please give it to me constantly.” He had to pull back from the relationship. “Where’s the personal growth? How much can you depend on another person? What parts of me are just rushing to conclusion?”Growing up with such a strong family, every day since I left the house at 18 was kind of a letdownVernon says that the relationship is neither over nor ongoing, “and I don’t mean to be vague”, he says. “This person is a central part of my life. But it wasn’t in the cards to be like,now we’re together.” That’s the Fable part: “Little lessons about what happens after that” – messages he’s still getting from the songs. His favourite is the gleaming benediction There’s a Rhythmn. “It says: I don’t know what’s gonna happen. It might not matter whether we’re together or not because you changed me for the better. We shouldn’t squander what didn’t happen. We should just be thankful for what we do have.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Growing up with such a strong family, every day since I left the house at 18 was kind of a letdown. So was I looking for that relationship because I wanted to have that peace? I have to make that for myself before that can ever happen.”Fittingly, when Charli xcx asked Vernon to appear on herBrat remix albumlast year, he refashioned I Think About It All the Time, about whether career and motherhood are incompatible. “What she’s talking about in that song, like, I’m always two steps ahead of myself, it was really easy for me to react to that,” says Vernon. “It was great timing because it felt like a coda for all the lessons I’ve been learning.”Vernon might be technically middle-aged, but he’s stopped feeling as if he is running out of time. “I’ve done enough personal work where now I feel young,” he says. “When I was 33, I was like, oh my God, I’m gonna die soon – like, life is short. But now, I’ve got my health. I feel like I’ve got a lot of years to live. To be able to say that and feel truthful, I feel like I really overcame some shit.”He knows some listeners might hate this sea change: after all, everything today is not exactly peaceful love. “I’m not really afraid of that,” he says. “I know that I need to do this for me. I would hate to think it feels like a distraction or that I’m ignoring the problems of the world to sell myself. But I give myself permission to put this kind of art into the world because it is about love, and we’re animals out here.”Days before Sable, Fable’s release, I speak to Vernon again: he has just flown to a cottage he’s been renting in Los Angeles, where he’s been splitting his time, after seeing Bob Dylan play Eau Claire at the weekend. Dylan was apparently in the mood to play It Ain’t Me, Babe in the style of Irving Berlin’s Puttin’ on the Ritz. “I didn’tlikeit? I wasn’t having a good time?” Vernon says over a video call, questioning himself. “And yet, every time words start to come out of my mouth, I’m like, you don’t need to say anything about it! The guy is a free fucking spirit.”In LA this week, he has a few more promotional duties, including hosting a basketball tournament. (“I bought ankle braces today.”) A month of being “full-bore” turned out to be all right. “I barely recognise myself,” he says, reclining in a black T-shirt. “I don’t think I would do this for ever. I don’t know if I’ll do it again. To have really given myself a gift – to not be getting ready to do the whole touring rigmarole, and to have been present enough to talk about something that I worked hard on for a super long time – has been really rewarding.” His system finally feels calm and reset. Friends have noticed the difference. “They’re like: ‘You seemgood,’” he says.As much as Sable, Fable reflects a radiant period, it also, fundamentally, emerged from depression, as did all Bon Iver records. Vernon has been learning to handle it differently. “I haven’t had a bad day since New Year’s,” he says. Back then, for the second year running, he was ill, home alone and miserable. Then his friend Aiden suggested: “‘How about 2025 – no defeatism?’ It was like a switch went off,” says Vernon. “What the fuck have I been doing? What do I have to feel sad about?” With any anxiety since, he says, “you notice it, you absorb it, you consider it and you breathe through it”.Vernon hopes that anyone initially drawn to the lonely woodsman of For Emma might find similar solace in Sable, Fable. “Running away to a cabin is very powerful because it’s an example that you can choose to do anything,” he says. “That’s the crazy part of having any freedom in this world.” Quitting touring or accepting a relationship’s end is no different. “In There’s a Rhythmn, I sing: ‘Get tall and walk away.’ Have the courage to walk away from something that seems to be the greatest thing on Earth, but it’s not serving you. Have courage to do something bold, not just for bold’s sake, but because you have the patience to locate what’s wrong.”Cottage industry: the enduring power of the ‘cabin in the woods’ albumRead moreIt didn’t initially dawn on him that both Sable and Fable contain the word “able”. If the album is about aptitude, he says, it’s: “Can you conceive of having the strength to move forward?” Next he might start a new group, make an album with Tobias Jesso Jr, reunite with Hadestown’s Anaïs Mitchell (who cast him as Orpheus in the original album) or create “a secular music church with the greatest sound system in the world”, he says. “What can I take from what me and my team have accomplished to break down the format of this tired thing that is touring? I’m in my early 40s. It’s a good time to still be young and to try to rattle the cage.”It’s why he can’t diss that weird Dylan show. “This motherfucker is not of this planet. And just because I was uncomfortable with everything musically, I still watched something real, at least.”Vernon thinks he has now taken all he can from Sable, Fable. “It makes me quite emotional, because it’s therapy,” he says. “It’s me constructing this giant map and then staring at it, and the wind is about to blow it away and then it will be for everyone else.” It’s another fable: just because a moment might not last, doesn’t mean it’s not meaningful or worth doing. Vernon had resisted being Bon Iver again, but he’s showing up for it, for love. “That’s it,” he laughs. “That’s what I’m trying to do.”Sable, Fable is out now on JagjaguwarThis article was amended on 11 April 2025.

This toad patrol is one of more than 200 across the country that take part in the national Toads on Roads project run by the amphibian and reptile conservation charity, Froglife.Across the six weeks, more than 50 volunteers on the Charlcombe Toad Rescue group spent more than 648 hours in high visibility jackets, armed with torches, buckets and special gloves, walking slowly up and down the road.Toads, frogs and newts are carefully picked up and taken safely in buckets to five drop off points to help them on their journey towards the lake.Chris Melbourne, who manages the collection of data for Charlcombe Toad Rescue, said: “This has been a gamechanger for our local amphibian population, with the casualty rate dropping from 62% before the patrol started to 3% this year, bucking national trends and giving the frogs, toads and newts a fighting chance of flourishing.“Throughout the 2025 season there were long stretches of cold and dry weather. This was followed by wet and warm conditions that were ideal for amphibians to be on the move. In one night on 23 February volunteers helped 1,119 toads, frogs and newts cross the road.”View image in fullscreenA newt on the road in Charlcombe Lane.Photograph: Courtesy Charlcombe Toad Rescue GroupBack in 2016, Froglife used data collected by toad patrols to explore what had been happening to the population of common toads across the UK. The research demonstrated that the populations had declined on average across the UK by 68% in just 30 years.The biggest challenges facing amphibians include habitat fragmentation due to roads, changes in farming practices and development, and the loss of habitats, such as ponds and the impact of pollution. The climate crisis is also adversely affecting amphibians, with milder winters leading to them waking up from their hibernation more frequently.Explore more on these topicsAmphibiansConservationSomersetWildlifeEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

For Brice Nguema, the junta leader turned civilian head of state, it could be a chance to cement his democratic credentials.Last November, 860,000 registered voters approved a referendum for a new constitution with two seven-year presidential terms and an amnesty for participants in theremoval of Ali Bongo, who had succeeded his father in 2009. Officials are yet to release data on the updated voters’ register but previously said they expected an additional 300,000 new registrations, including from those who have recently come of age.Observer missions are already in place, including that of an eight-person Commonwealth team led by Danny Faure, a former president of Seychelles.Four independents are in the race for president but analysts say the favourite is Nguema. Since coming to power, 50-year-old Nguema has styled himself as an anti-corruption crusader who had to resort to a coup to end an unpopular family dynasty, despite also being a cousin to Bongo. In October 2023, he made headlines for reportedly refusing to draw a salary for the presidency.Those announcements drew plaudits in the oil-rich central African state where a third of the 2.3 million people live in poverty.“Gabonese tell themselves that someone who works with this much ardour is trying to transform things,” Joseph Tonda, a sociologist at Omar Bongo University in Libreville, told Reuters news agency earlier this month.But like his cousin, Nguema has maintained close ties with France even in the face of high anti-French sentiments in the region. And a 2020 investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) revealed multimillion-dollar assets abroad, believed to be the proceeds of embezzlement during his time in the presidential guard.His closest challenger is the ex-prime minister Alain Claude Bilie By Nze, who was in government until the coup. Nze, who has campaigned as a pragmatic veteran seeking to create jobs and reduce the size of government, has also tried to dissociate himself from the old guard.Other candidates include the former tax official Joseph Lapensée Essingone and Stéphane Germain Iloko, previously a member of the former ruling Gabonese Democratic party (PDG).The coup, one of a string of military takeovers in west and central Africa between 2020 and 2023, was well received in Gabon, with many citizens trooping to the streets of Port Gentil and Libreville, its two biggest cities.But there are concerns that Nguema may also be using the same Bongo playbook of muzzling dissent.In particular, the Union for Democracy and Social Integration (UDIS) party – once allied with the former ruling party – has accused the administration of targeting its exiled leader, Hervé Patrick Opiangah, who is the subject of a criminal investigation for alleged incest and undermining state security.Opiangah, 54, a former mining minister, has proclaimed his innocence and filed a complaint with the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights.Edmond Ngadi, a UDIS spokesperson who has called the matter a “state conspiracy”, said Opiangah was being targeted for mobilising for people to vote no during the 16 November referendum.“This is a blatant violation of human rights … he is a Gabonese citizen who simply asks to return to his country safely to be able to secure his family, secure his businesses and also participate in the life of his country,” Ngadi said.Explore more on these topicsGabonAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

That is much lower than the current yield on a two-year US treasury bond of about 3.8%.Zimbabwe’s finance minister, Mthuli Ncube, said: “The payments will continue. We are very serious about this.”Mugabe’s governmentseized more than 4,000mostly white-owned farms,often violently, from about the year 2000 to redistribute to black people in what it claimed was restitution for the dispossession of British colonial rule.However, Mugabe and his croniestook nearly 40%of the 14m hectares (about 35m acres) confiscated for themselves, according to a 2010investigation by a local news outlet, ZimOnline. Agricultural production, which had accounted for 40% of exports,plungedand the economy collapsed, with hyperinflation reaching a staggering500bn%in 2008.Zimbabwe cannot borrow from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund as it has been in arrears since 2000 and 2001, respectively. Governmentdebtwas$21bn late last year, about half of which was arrears and penalties.The compensation payments to the displaced farmers are one of the requirements of international lenders to start a debt restructuring process with Zimbabwe, including a new IMF programme.Andrew Pascoe, who signed the 2020 compensation deal while head of the Commercial Farmers’ Union, confirmed the first payments had been received on 24 March and thanked Zimbabwe’s government, in comments included in the ministry of finance statement. He said: “We are extremely grateful.”However, Tony Hawkins, a retired University of Zimbabwe economics professor, called the payments a “publicity stunt”, noting that the US could block an IMF programme. A US law “restricts US support for multilateral financing to Zimbabwe until Zimbabwe makes concrete governance and economic reforms”, according to theUS state department.Of using government bonds to pay farmers, Hawkins said: “We continue to accumulate arrears because we are unable to service our foreign debt, so we can’t really afford to take on new debt commitments … It’s derisory, the more you look at it.”About 1,000 former farmers had signed up for compensation, said Harry Orphanides, one of Pascoe’s co-negotiators. He said: “Look, it’s not a perfect deal. But there was no other alternative.”Explore more on these topicsZimbabweLand rightsRaceInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)AgricultureFarmingWorld BanknewsShareReuse this content"

Despite being jailed,attacked, shot, and facing threats of violence, including from Museveni’s son, Wine said he felt he had little choice but to try to advance the hope for change that was energising Ugandans, especially the young.“We cannot just give the election to General Museveni,” he said, in an interview with the Guardian.Theleader of the National Unity Platform(NUP) party, Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu,said he expected the January 2026 election, in which Museveni has said he will stand for what would be his seventh term in office, to be bloody.But, with80% of the Ugandan populationunder the age of 35, Wine believes change can come.“Young people are so hopeful because they see the possibility,” he said. “Ultimately the good will of the people is what is important for this election and for our campaign. They know if you are not given freedom, you don’t have a life.“I think I stir a lot of hope because I don’t shut my big mouth, and that’s a big challenge to the regime.”Museveni, now in his eighties, has held power inUgandasince 1986, one of the world’s longest standing national leaders.In 2021, Africa Elections Watch observers saidthe electionwas conducted with “irregularities”, while the US state department called it “fundamentally flawed”. During that campaign,Wine was imprisonedand faced attacks and death threats.View image in fullscreenBobi Wine is detained during an anti-government demonstration in Kampala, 15 March 2021.Photograph: Abubaker Lubowa/Reuters“I am worried about what is ahead, of course,” said Wine. “Thinking about how brutal it is going to be, it’s going to be terrible. We are already seeing signs it will be more brutal. Last month, we had a byelection and one of my MPs died. Died after being tortured by the regime. Journalists were very badly beaten and observers from the US embassy had to leave the field.”Among the enemies Wine and his NUP party have made is Museveni’s son, 50-year-old Muhoozi Kainerugaba. He was made chief of defence forces by his father and is also chair of the Patriotic League of Uganda, which lobbies heavily for him to succeed the presidency. Kainerugaba has made vicious public threats to Wine on his social media accounts, including saying he was keeping a bullet specially for him.“More reason to stand up,” said Wine.“I am convinced that if the world stands firm with us, 2026 could be a turning point. If the world leaders do not stand on the side of oppression, but help; if they criticise and distance themselves from the absence of human rights and democracy.View image in fullscreenWine greets supporters on the campaign trail near Kayunga, December 2020.Photograph: Sumy Sadurni/AFP/Getty Images“I get the feeling right now that the international community is more concerned with diplomacy rather than democracy; more concerned with business than rights and freedom.”Asked about the impact of Donald Trump’s populist presidency on Uganda,including the huge aid cutsand disinterest in peacekeeping or humanitarian concerns, he said: “We are now in a situation where there is less concern for Africa. If lifesaving aid is cut then how will aid for democracy fare?“Aid cuts are going to impact Uganda very negatively. But also much aid is diverted to support this corrupt regime. The aid that was helping in the health sector is not there any more, so we are going to have less medicines and more bullets,” he said.“We have always been asking for targeted sanctions on those in the regime and asking the US not to send their taxpayers’ money to be spent on things that can be used against our people. The guns that kill our people are American guns. The soldiers who torture our people are trained in America.Lawyer for Ugandan opposition politician ‘arrested and tortured’Read more“So we want America and other world powers not to be partners in crime, but to call out General Museveni for the absence of human rights.“I believe foreign aid, in many ways, is lost in patronage and corruption, only to have the burden of repayment on next generations. The aid we need is in sticking to values. If we have a good democracy and human rights, that will bring leaders who will stamp down on corruption.“We lose two-thirds of our annual revenue to corruption – 10tn Ugandan shillings ($2.5bn) stolen every year. That figure comes from the inspector general of government, so it could be more. He could be giving us a low figure. Whichever way, it is huge,” he said.“Our debt burden is heavy, it will take us 97 years to pay back and of course we have new predators. But I believe it is fixable. We have human resources, we have a young, energised population. We are endowed with natural wealth and resources. If corruption is stamped out, we can make every sector work that could rise us from poverty and indebtedness.”View image in fullscreenWine and his wife, Barbie Kyagulanyi, at the 96th Academy Awards in Hollywood, California, 10 March 2024.Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesWine’s wife, the author Barbie Itungo Kyagulanyi, was a linchpin in Wine’s first parliamentary campaign in 2017 and joined him on the presidential campaign trail in 2020 with her own manifesto for women’s rights.Their struggle was documented in theOscar-nominated film Bobi Wine: The People’s President, which was released after the 2021 campaign.Kyagulanyi washeld under an illegal house arrestwith her husband in 2021. But she is “energised” for 2026 he says.“Those who are fighting for freedom, I’m afraid they don’t decide [to do it], they don’t apply. It happens to them,” he said. “For me, I would like to be making music not risking my life, but there is no choice.“While I am here speaking to you, I don’t know if I’ll be in jail next week. If I am still alive and not in jail by the end of this year, then I’m going to run for presidency, again.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentBobi WineUgandaAfricaYoweri MuseveninewsShareReuse this content"

A proposal had already been sent to US officials, she said.Mexico’s failure to keep up with its water deliveries hassparked a diplomatic spat with its largest trading partner. A day earlier, Trump said he would escalate consequences, including tariffs or sanctions on Mexico. Texas Republicans have also publicly accused Mexico of flagrantly ignoring the treaty, harming farmers who depend on the water deliveries.“ForTexasfarmers who are requesting water, there will be an immediate delivery of a certain number of millions of cubic meters that can be provided according to the water availability in the Rio Grande,” Sheinbaum said.Under the 1944 treaty that outlines water sharing between the two countries through a network of interconnected dams and reservoirs, Mexico must send 1.75m acre-feet of water to the US from the Rio Grande every five years. An acre-foot of water is enough to fill about half an Olympic swimming pool.US rejects Mexico’s request for water as Trump opens new battle frontRead moreThe treaty’s current five-year cycle is up in October, but Mexico has sent less than 30% of the required water, according to data from the International Boundary andWaterCommission.Sheinbaum has said Mexico is complying with the treaty based on water availability, pointing to drought conditions that have sapped Mexico’s supply. She expects an agreement in the coming days, she said on Friday, and did not see further conflict. The treaty was “fair”, she added.Mexican officials were scrambling to come up with a plan to increase the amount of water sent to the United States because of growing concern that Trump could drag the dispute into trade negotiations.Mexico’s federal government may clash with northern Mexican states that closely guard their water supply if it looks to enforce a controversial amendment inserted into the treaty last year that empowers federal officials to take extra water to comply with obligations, sources told Reuters.Explore more on these topicsMexicoTexasWaterAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

US government bonds – typically seen as one of the world’s safest financial assets – continued to be sold off, and were on course for their biggest weekly loss since 2019. The dollar also fell against a basket of currencies, and was down against the euro and the pound.Leading stock indices paused for breath on Friday after days of torrid trading. The FTSE 100 rose 0.6% in London. The S&P 500 increased 1.8% and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.6% in New York.The S&P 500 finished an extraordinarily volatile week for markets up 5.7%, its biggest weekly gain since November 2023.“We are doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly. DJT”Some of Wall Street’s most influential figures were unconvinced. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Larry Fink, CEO of the investment giant BlackRock, told CNBC. Far from providing certainty, the 90-day pause on higher US tariffs on much of the world “means longer, more elevated uncertainty”, he added.Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the US’s largest bank, said the world’s largest economy was facing “considerable turbulence” as a key measure of consumer confidence tumbled to its lowest level since the Covid-19 pandemic – and the second-lowest level on record.US consumer sentiment has dropped 11% to 50.8 this month, ahead the pause announced by Trump earlier this week, according to a regularly survey compiled by the University of Michigan.Expectations for inflation meanwhile surged, with respondents indicating they are bracing for prices to rise by 6.7% over the coming year – the survey’s highest year-ahead inflation expectation reading since 1981.“There is great optimism in this economy,” Leavitt claimed at the White House briefing when asked about the survey. “Trust in President Trump. He knows what he’s doing. This is a proven economic formula.”Trump won back the White House last November by pledging to rapidly bring down prices – something he has claimed, in recent weeks, is already happening. US inflation climbed at an annual rate of 2.4% last month, according to official data.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added, however, that a bipartisan divide – with Democrats growing more pessimistic, while Republicans become more upbeat – suggests that people are allowing their political views to cloud their economic confidence.The US’s top markets watchdog is facing demands from senior Democrats to launch an investigation intoalleged insider trading and market manipulationafter Trump declared on social media that it was “A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!” hours before announcingWednesday’s climbdown on tariffs.Days of erratic policymaking constructed a rollercoaster week for markets, with the S&P 500 dropping 12% in just four sessions, before surging back almost 10% in a single day after the administration pulled back from imposing higher tariffs on most countries, exceptChina, which is facing a 145% tariff on exports to the US.In a letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),Senate Democratsincluding Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer wrote: “It is unconscionable that as American families are concerned about their financial security during this economic crisis entirely manufactured by the President, insiders may have actively profited from the market volatility and potentially perpetrated financial fraud on the American public.”‘The damage is done’: Trump’s tariffs put the dollar’s safe haven status in jeopardyRead moreTesla meanwhilestopped taking orders in Chinafor two models it previously imported from the US, as companies scramble to adapt to prohibitive tariffs imposed in Trump’s trade war.The manufacturer, run by Trump’s close allyElon Musk, removed “order now” buttons on its Chinese website for its Model S saloon and Model X sports utility vehicle.Tesla did not give any indication of why it had made the changes but it came after the rapid escalation of the trade war between the US and China.The border taxes make the goods trade between the two countries prohibitively expensive and mean cars imported from the US are now much less attractive inChinathan those produced locally.In the UK, economists warned that stronger than expected growth of 0.5% in February is likely to prove short lived as the impact of Trump’s trade war is felt throughout the global economy.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpChinaAsia PacificTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In tit-for-tat moves, Trump has raised total tariffs on China to 145%, while China responded on Friday byincreasing its levies on US exports to 125%.The border taxes make the goods trade between the two countries prohibitively expensive and mean cars imported from the US are now much less attractive inChinathan those produced locally.New orders for the two imported models were also no longer available on Tesla’s mini-program account on the Chinese social media app WeChat, Reuters reported. The “order now” buttons were replaced with “view available cars” for the Model S and Model X on the US carmaker’s website, with some remaining cars appearing to be available for Chinese buyers.Since 2020 Tesla has produced its Model 3 and Model Y cars in a large factory in Shanghai, giving it some insulation from the tariffs. However, the company is still likely to be heavily affected. Analysis by Nikkei Asia in 2023 suggested that about 40% of the companies supplying Tesla with battery materials were Chinese, although the carmaker has sought to source parts and materials from outside China as trade tensions between the US and China have increased.Musk has been a key player in the Trump administration, leading the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, in its efforts to slash the US federal budget that have beendescribed as illegal by constitutional experts. Yet he has also appeared to criticise the tariffs, saying last week that there should be“zero tariffs” between the EU and US. That is a stark contradiction to the 10% tariffs imposed by Trump on every nation in the world for 90 days, with the threat of the return of even higher levies.Tesla last month warned the US government that tariffs could harm American companies, in a letter to the White House’s trade representative.The possible loss of orders would represent a significant financial blow to Tesla, at a time when it is already struggling withslumping demand, particularly in Europe. Although it is tricky to work out the motivations of buyers, analysts have said that Musk’sclose association with Trump has tarnished the brand, contributing to the sales slump. The company also has an ageing lineup of models that are struggling to compete with newer offerings, particularly from Chinese rivals such as BYD.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The statement also suggested it may be Beijing’s last move in the tit-for-tat tariff rises as “at the current tariff level, there is no market acceptance for US goods exported to China”.“If the US continues to impose tariffs on Chinese goods exported to the US, China will ignore it,” it said, flagging that there were other countermeasures to come.Some marketscontinued to tumbleon Friday, as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, described theUS president’s 90-day tariff pause– which sets most tariffs at 10% until July – as “fragile”.Asian indices followed Wall Street lower on Friday, with Japan’s Nikkei down nearly 5% and Hong Kong stocks heading towards the biggest weekly decline since 2008. Oil prices were also expected to drop for a second consecutive week.Graph of market fallsChinese officials have been canvassing other trading partners about how to deal with the US tariffs, after the country was excluded from Trump’s 90-day pause of the steepest global tariffs. Instead the US president made consecutive increases to duties on Chinese imports, which are now 145%.On Friday, Xi welcomed Spain’sPedro Sánchez, after also talking to counterparts in Saudi Arabia and South Africa. According to the official Chinese summary of the talks, Xi said “there will be no winners in a tariff war, and going against the world will isolate oneself”, in an apparent reference to the US.“China and the EU should fulfil their international responsibilities, jointly maintain the trend of economic globalisation and the international trade environment, and jointly resist unilateral bullying, not only to safeguard their own legitimate rights and interests, but also to safeguard international fairness and justice, and to safeguard international rules and order,” the summary said the Chinese president told Sánchez.0:40China condemns US  'bullying' as Trump's 104% tariffs kick in – videoSpain said Sánchez told Xi his country favoured a more balanced relationship between the EU and China based on negotiations to resolve differences and cooperation in areas of common interest.Xi plans to travel to south-east Asia, including Vietnam and Cambodia, next week.Macronwrote on X early on Fridaythat Trump’s partial tariff suspension, pausing new rates on various countries that would have risen as high as 50%, “sends out a signal and leaves the door open for talks. But this pause is a fragile one.”He added: “This 90-day pause means 90 days of uncertainty for all our businesses, on both sides of the Atlantic and beyond.”Battered financial markets were given a brief reprieve on Wednesday when Trump decided to pause duties on dozens of countries. However, his escalating trade dispute with China, the world’s second-largest economy,has continued to fuel fears of recession and further retaliation.The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, tried to assuage the fears of sceptics by telling a cabinet meeting on Thursday that more than 75 countries wanted to start trade negotiations, and Trump had expressed hope of a deal with China.Life in Shanghai, China’s commercial capital, goes on but anti-US sentiment is hardeningRead moreBut the uncertainty in the meantime extendedsome of the most volatile tradingsince the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.The US’s S&P 500 index ended 3.5% lower on Thursday and was now down about 15% from its all-time peak in February. Some analysts believe stocks have further to fall owing to the uncertainty surrounding the US tariff policy.Bessent shrugged off the renewed market sell-off on Thursday and predicted that striking deals with other countries would bring more certainty.The US and Vietnam agreed to begin formal trade talks after Bessent spoke to the Vietnamese deputy prime minister, Ho Duc Phoc, the White House said.The south-east Asian manufacturing hub is prepared to crack down on Chinese goods being shipped to the US via its territory in the hope of avoiding tariffs, Reuters reported on Friday.Taiwan’s president said his government would also be among the first batch of trading partners to enter negotiations. Taiwan, listed for a 32% tariff, has offered zero tariffs as a basis for talks.Japan’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, has set up a taskforce led by a close aide that hopes to visit Washington next week, according to local media.View image in fullscreenA man looks at digital boards at the Taiwan stock exchange in Tapei after Trump’s surprise decision to pause global tariffs.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesWhile Trumpsuddenly paused his “reciprocal” tariffson other countries hours after they came into effect this week, he did not include China, instead increasing duties on Chinese imports as punishment for Beijing’s initial move to retaliate.Trump had imposed tariffs on Chinese goods of 145% since taking office, a White House official said.Meanwhile, Trump told reporters at the White House he thought the US could make a deal with China, but reiterated his argument that Beijing had “really taken advantage” of the US for a long time.“I’m sure that we’ll be able to get along very well,” the US president said, referring to Xi. “In a true sense, he’s been a friend of mine for a long period of time, and I think that we’ll end up working out something that’s very good for both countries.”Xi and Trump are not known to have spoken since before Trump’s inauguration. Beijing has said it has no intention of backing down to what it terms as Trump’s “bullying” with tariffs.“We will never sit idly by and watch while the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people are infringed, nor will we sit idly by as international economic and trade rules and the multilateral trading system are undermined,” the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said on Thursday.As well as retaliatory tariffs, Beijing has restricted imports of Hollywood films, and put 18 US companies on trade restriction lists.The commerce ministry said China’s door was open to dialogue but this must be based on mutual respect.The US tariff pause does not apply to duties paid by Canada and Mexico, whose goods are still subject to 25% fentanyl-related tariffs unless they comply with the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement’s rules of origin.With trade hostilities persisting among the top three US trade partners, Goldman Sachs estimates the probability of a recession at 45%.Even with the rollback, the overall average import duty rate imposed by the US is the highest in more than a century, according to Yale University researchers.It also did little to soothe business leaders’ worries about the fallout from Trump’s trade dispute and its chaotic implementation: soaring costs, falling orders and snarled supply chains.One reprieve came, however, when the EU said it wouldpause its first counter-tariffs.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsGlobal economyTrump administrationTariffsInternational tradeDonald TrumpChinanewsShareReuse this content"

This is a fresh blow to green energy developers in the US, still reeling from the Trump administration’svow to roll back the Biden era’s green incentives.Leslie Abrahams, a deputy director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington DC, said the tariffs would probably hinder the rollout of clean energy in the US and push the country to the margins of the global market.‘Oligarchy’: Trump exempts big oil donors from tariffs packageRead moreSpecifically, they are expected to drive up the price of developing clean power, because to date the US has been heavily reliant on importing clean power technologies. “And not just imports of the final goods. Even the manufacturing that we do in the United States relies on imported components,” she said.The US government’s goal to develop its manufacturing base by opening new factories could make these components available domestically, but it is likely to take time. It will also come at considerable cost, because the materials typically imported to build these factories – cement, steel, aluminium – will be subject to tariffs too, Abrahams said.“At the same time there are broader,global economic implicationsthat might make it difficult to access inexpensive capital to build,” she added. Investors who had previously shown an interest in the US under the green-friendly Biden administration are likely to balk at the aggressively anti-green messages from the White House.Abrahams said this would mean a weaker appetite for investment in rolling out green projects across the US, and in the research and development of early-stage clean technologies of the future. This is likely to have long-term implications for the US position in the global green energy market, meaning it will “cede some of our potential market share abroad”, Abrahams added.Instead, countries likeChinaare likely to divert sales of their clean energy tech away from the US to other countries eager to develop green energy, Abrahams said. “So on the one hand, that should help to accelerate adoption of clean energy in those countries, which is good for emissions, but for the US, that is future market share that we’re ceding,” she said.‘Clean energy is unstoppable, with or without Trump’It’s important to distinguish between the US and the rest of the world, according to Kingsmill Bond, a strategist for the energy thinktank Ember.“The more the US cuts itself off from the rest of the world, the more the rest of the world will get on with things and the US will be left behind. This is a tragedy for the clean energy industry in the US, but for everyone else there are opportunities,” he said.Analysis by the climate campaign group 350.org has found that despite rising costs and falling green investment in the US, Trump’s trade war will not affect the energy transition and renewables trade globally.It said the US was already “merely a footnote, not a global player” in the race to end the use of fossil fuels. Only 4% of China’s clean tech exports go to the US, it said, in a trade sector where sales volume grew by about 30% last year.“Trump’s tariffs won’t slow the global energy transition – they’ll only hurt ordinary people, particularly Americans,” said Andreas Sieber, an associate director at 350.org. “The transition to renewables is unstoppable, with or without him. His latest move does little to impact the booming clean energy market but will isolate the US and drive up costs for American consumers.”View image in fullscreenPeople work on a production line for wind turbine blades in Jilin province, north-east China.Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/ShutterstockOne senior executive at a big European renewable energy company said developers were likely to press on with existing US projects but in future would probablyinvest in other markets.“So we won’t be doing less, we’ll just be going somewhere else,” said the executive, who asked not to be named. “There is no shortage of demand for clean energy projects globally, so we’re not scaling back our ambitions. And excluding the US could make stretched supply chains easier to manage.”Countries likely to benefit from the fresh attention of renewable energy investors include burgeoning markets in south-east Asia, where fossil fuel reliance remains high and demand for energy is rocketing. Australia and Brazil have also emerged as countries that stand to gain.“In times like these, countries will be increasingly on the hunt for domestic solutions,” Bond said. “And that means clean energy and local supply chains. There are always climate reasons to go green, but there are national security reasons now too.”The challenge for governments hoping to seize the opportunity provided by the US green retreat will be to assure rattled investors that they offer a safe place to invest in the climate agenda.Dhara Vyas, the chief executive ofEnergyUK, the UK industry’s trade body, said: “Certainty has always been the thing that investors say they need. The UK is seen as a stable country with a stable government, but now more than ever we need to double down on giving certainty to investors.”“Investors do like certainty,” Bond agreed. “But they also like growth and opportunity, so that’s why there is some confidence that they will continue to deploy capital in the sector.”‘The US still matters’Although the green investment slowdown may be largely limited to the US, this still poses concerns for global climate progress, according to Marina Domingues, the head of new energies for the consultancy Rystad Energy.“The US is a huge emitter country. So everything the US does still really matters to the global energy transition and how we account for CO2,” she said. The US is the second most polluting country in the world, behind China, which produces almost three times its carbon emissions. But the US’s green retreat comes at a time when the country was planning to substantially increase its domestic energy demand.After years of relatively steady energy demand, Rystad predicts a 10% growth in US electricity consumption from a boom in AI datacentres alone. The economy is also likely to require more energy to power an increase in domestic manufacturing as imports from China dwindle.In the absence of a growing energy industry, this is likely to come from fossil fuels, meaning growing climate emissions. The US is expected to make use of its abundance of shale gas, but it is planning to use more coal in the future too.In the same week that Trump set out his tariffs, he signed four executive orders aimed at preventing the US from phasing out coal, in what climate campaigners at 350.org described as an “abuse of power”.Anne Jellema, the group’s executive director, said: “President Trump’s latest attempt to force-feed coal to the US is a dangerous fantasy that endangers our health, our economy and our future.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisEnergy industryGreen economyEnergyEnergy efficiencyOil (Business)Oil and gas companiesanalysisShareReuse this content"

China has previously accused Taiwan of “manipulating” possible Chinese involvement in the case, saying it was casting aspersions before the facts were clear.Taiwan has reportedfive cases of sea cable malfunctionsthis year, compared with three each in 2024 and 2023, according to its digital ministry.Taiwan’s coastguard has in recent months stepped up efforts to protect its sea cables, including monitoring a “blacklist” of close to 100 China-linked ships registered to a country other than that of its owner near Taiwan, officials familiar with the matter told Reuters.Taiwan said in January it suspected a China-linked ship of damaging an undersea cable off its northern coast. The shipowner denied the accusations.Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has repeatedly complained about“grey zone” Chinese activities around the island, designed to pressure it without direct confrontation, such as balloon overflights and sand dredging.Taipei was alarmed after another Chinese-linked ship was suspected of damaging a different cable this year, prompting the navy and other agencies to step up efforts to protect the undersea communication links, which are vital to the island’s connections to the rest of the world.Taiwan, whose government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims, has pointed to similarities between what it has experienced anddamage to undersea cables in the Baltic Seafollowing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Illustration: Meeri AnneliThe total amount of destroyed forest and bush covered an area larger than greater Sydney, taking in the Blue Mountains, the Illawarra, the southern highlands and the Goulburn and Shoalhaven regions.It is more than 10 times larger than the area the NSW government is assessing for a possible “great koala national park”. But most of the cleared area – 81% – was inQueensland.About three-quarters of the lost forest is estimated to have been cleared for agriculture, to create cattle pasture and crop fields. The analysis found 13% was removed by the forestry industry and 5% for development of infrastructure, including mining. Just 4% was likely due to natural causes, such as bushfire and drought.Nearly all of the forest destruction occurred on a small scale that did not require consideration under federal environment law. Less than 2% of it was approved by the federal environment minister.Get Guardian Australia environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as an emailCampaigners say it shows the national Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act – which the Albanese government promised to rewrite in this term before delaying its plans indefinitely – is deeply flawed.‘Every year matters’: Queensland’s critically endangered ‘bum-breathing’ turtle battles the oddsRead moreDarcie Carruthers, an Australian Conservation Foundation nature campaigner, said: “It beggars belief that with nearly 2m hectares of potential koala habitat gone in just a decade, the federal government would continue to approve projects that bulldoze koalas’ homes. But that’s exactly what’s happening.”A separate analysis by the foundation found that almost 3,000 hectares of potential koala habitat were approved for clearing in 2024.Carruthers said the outsized contribution of the beef industry towards habitat loss showed “the food system can do much more for koalas”.“There are solutions to make sure people, farms, koalas and the forests we all depend on can all thrive,” she said.View image in fullscreenA koala in a tree near Bagotville in northern NSW.Photograph: Aston Brown/The GuardianGemma Plesman, a senior campaigner atGreenpeaceAustralia Pacific, said the data showed the “complete failure” of federal environment laws to protect “Australia’s most iconic” endangered species. “Every year koalas lose more of their home – mostly driven by beef production – and neither of our major parties have been able to stop the destruction,” she said.Koalas in Queensland, NSW and the Australian Capita Territory were formally listed as being vulnerable to extinction in 2012. In 2022 the threat level was raised to endangered after scientists concluded that numbers were likely to have dropped by half over the previous 20 years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dr Christine Hosking, a conservation scientist at the University of Queensland who has researched how the climate emergency will shrink the koala’s habitat, said the threat was “playing out now in real time”.‘Like finding gold’: plains-wanderers spotted in Melbourne’s west for first time in 30 years with help of AIRead more“Areas of New South Wales and Queensland have seen big reductions [in koala numbers] and that’s been down to protracted droughts and heatwaves,” she said. “Koala’s can’t thermoregulate above about 37C and we now get successive days above that [as well as] days over 40C in a row. They simply can’t survive.”Hosking’s research shows that as temperatures rise the koala’s habitat in Queensland and NSW contracts eastward, pushing them into already developed areas where they face other risks such as vehicles and dog attacks.AUniversity of Sydney studyin February on one of the country’s few chlamydia-free koala populations – located in south-western Sydney – found urban development had effectively isolated the population, leading to high levels of in-breeding that made the species more susceptible to disease.“We’re losing koalas for complex reasons,” Hosking said. “Habitat loss is the No 1 threat because they’re so limited in what they can eat, but then you have roads, urbanisation, chlamydia and, of course, climate change.”Prof Mathew Crowther, a conservation biologist and koala ecologist at the University of Sydney, said the marsupial’s specialised diet – eucalyptus leaves – put it in conflict with humans.Eucalyptus trees that grow on flatter, more fertile soils generally produce leaves higher in nutrients and lower in toxins. But those flat, fertile soils are where humans like to settle and grow food. “Koalas and people want the same kind of land,” Crowther said.He said national parks tended to be in more rugged country, which was not the koala’s preferred habitat. Many live outside national parks on private land.“We need to make sure there’s enough habitat that is linked together, we need to make sure regrowth and plantings are allowed to happen and we have to give incentives for landholders,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Last chanceEndangered speciesWildlifeEndangered habitatsConservationAnimalsLabor partynewsShareReuse this content"

The 2005 HRW report does not mention these acts.The allegations led members of the Hazara community, which has a significant presence in the electorate of Bruce, to lodge their own dissenting submissions to the inquiry, alleging the claims relied on “racist tropes” and sought to erase the “well-documented persecution of an entire ethnic group”.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterSafi did not directly comment on those allegations when contacted by Guardian Australia, instead stating he was “a staunch advocate for freedom of religion or belief for all individuals worldwide”.“As someone who fled the country because of war, I know everyone under the Taliban suffered, and my advocacy for human rights is shaped by those experiences,” Safi said.The Senate submission co-authored by Safi said, in reference to conflict in Afghanistan, “that victims of war are not based on ethnicity”.“The victims of war are targeted based on ideology,” the joint submission said. “This means, whoever opposes the Taliban and their ideology, is perceived as the Taliban’s enemy. Therefore, their perceived animosity is not based on ethnic division.”A 2022 briefing paper on Afghanistan, prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, states the Hazara community are an ethnic group that represents an estimated 10-20% of the country’s population. It states the Hazara face “a high risk of harassment and violence (…) on the basis of their ethnicity and sectarian affiliation”.The department notes the Hazara community has been historically persecuted, noting it was subjected to “the worst single recorded massacre in the country’s recent history” in August 1998, when the Taliban, a predominantly Pashtun organisation, “massacred at least 2,000 Hazaras”.The submission co-authored by Safi also expressed frustration that other ethnic groups from Afghanistan had allegedly been “sidelined” by the Australian government and media, due to an alleged prioritisation of the Hazara community.“Pashtuns have had the most casualties compared to others and this needs to be acknowledged by the Australian government as the 20 years’ war existed mostly in the Pashtun provinces,” the submission stated.Thousands of Hazaras who fled Afghanistan after persecution from the Taliban in the 1990s settled in Melbourne’s south-eastern suburbs, within the federal electorate of Bruce. The electorate is also home to other Afghan ethnic groups.Safi said: “A full and fair reading of my submission makes clear that I advocated for every single living individual at risk from the national atrocity and humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan under the Taliban.”Guardian Australia has spoken to other co-authors of the report who stand by its claims.Bruce is held by the incumbent Labor MP, Julian Hill. A margin of 6.6% at the 2022 election has been reduced to 5.3% after a redistribution. .skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is our finding that these attacks were in fact based on ethnicity – in that the victims were targeted because of their ethnicity.”A dissenting submission made by members of the Hazara community, who asked for the Senate to withhold their names, said the submission co-authored by Safi had “the effect of amplifying racist tropes”.“It highlights the actions of a few actors in a past civil war, drawing attention to ethnicity to imply the guilt of entire ethnic groups, or to imply that people who belong to ethnic groups other than Pashtun are violent in nature,” the dissenting submission said.A separate dissenting report by two academics specialising in Afghanistan at La Trobe University and Deakin University, along with solicitors and PhD candidates, accused the submission of containing “a series of factually incorrect statements and racist prejudices”.“Instead of acknowledging the historical and current persecution of the Hazaras, and the significant risks faced by Hazaras in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime; the authors deliberately blame the Hazaras for the general violence and human rights abuses that were perpetrated during several phases of the war in Afghanistan,” the academics and lawyers said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Liberal partyAustralian politicsAfghanistanCoalitionnewsShareReuse this content"

It led to perverse outcomes such asobscure and unpopulated islands being whacked with trade sanctions.Revealed: Norfolk Island and uninhabited Australian territories hit with Trump’s tariffs based on mislabelled shipmentsRead moreAustralia, which has a trade deficit with the US (we buy more stuff than we sell), escaped with the relatively low – in a world of vastly changed expectations – tariff rate of 10%.Others were less fortunate.Goods from the EU were hit with an import duty of 20%, and Japanese goods 24%. China was hit with tariffs of 34% – which came on top of the 20% existing rate.China imposed its own tariffs of 84% on US imported goods – andagain to 125% on Friday.By then, in a series of tit-for-tat retaliations, America’s tariff on Chinese goods had reached an unbelievable 145% – raising the prospect that trade between the world’s two economic giants will simply disappear.Donald Trump’s trade warAn act of economic self-harmAustralia ships less than 5% of the total value of exports to the US. Experts say we should be shielded from the fallout from a global trade war – a recession is not on the cards – but we are not immune.The Reserve Bank is expected to cut rates when it next meets on 19-20, even as the RBA governor, Michele Bullock,pushes back against calls for more aggressive policy easing.Instead, economists say the US will be the biggest loser from its trade aggression.Tariffs are a tax on imports and will raise the prices of goods for everyday Americans, costing an average of $US4,700 in 2024, according to estimates by The Budget Lab.Americans will be paying 64% more for clothing in the short run, while prices for electric equipment will be 46% higher, and car prices 12% higher.0:52Donald Trump explains decision to pause US tariffs for 90 days - videoAs was widely reported, JP Morgan said there was a 60% chance the trade shock would drive the US into recession.Trump assured the world that “I know what the hell I’m doing”, but investors around the world were panicking.And within 12 hours of the reciprocal tariffs coming into effect on 9 April, Trump had reversed course. He paused them for 90 days (with the notable exception of China), which he said would give countries the chance to come and do a deal.But what really changed Trump’s mind?The markets get ‘the yips’On 2 April, Trump declared that his tariffs would “make American wealthy again”.But a week later, when the higher duties came into effect, it was clear that Americans were suddenly and substantially less wealthy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

DJT,” Trump wrote on Wednesday morning, 9 April, US time.Hours later, Trump announced the pause.The US’ chief benchmark, the S&P 500, closed up 9.5% that day, gaining about US$4tn, regaining more than two-thirds of the value it had lost over the previous four trading days.It was one of the biggest rises since the second world war.Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 caught some of the exuberance, closing up 4.5% to record its strongest trading day since the pandemic.Days earlier it had also recorded itssteepest one-day fallsince the pandemic.How it started vs how it’s goingThe Australian dollar, which threatened to plunge below US59c earlier this week, hadspiked above US62c on Friday.Despite the rebound, after eight days of chaotic trading, the S&P/ASX 200 was down about 4%, taking the benchmark back to levels reached mid last year.“Equities probably do go lower from here, but you’re also going to see some massive rallies along the way. It’s not just going to be one way down or one way up,” Oshi says.Trump’s ‘Liz Truss’ momentMeanwhile, something curious is happening outside equities.Traders have also been selling the American dollar, a counterintuitive move given money tends to flow into the greenback during volatile times.AMP’s chief economist, Shane Oliver, says the panic in the bond market reflected investors losing faith in American assets as the ultimate safe port of call in a storm.“It has an echo of Liz Truss,” Oliver says, referring to when a meltdown in British bonds forced the former UK prime ministerto cancel plans for major tax cuts.Markets slide further amid fears of escalating trade war between China and USRead more“But it’s not just that. I don’t think Truss destroyed confidence in [her] government like Trump has [in his].”It was this spectre of a bond market revolt – or in other words, the threat to a hugely indebted country from a big rise in borrowing costs – that eventually appeared to convince Trump to press pause on his reciprocal tariffs.Asked to explain, Trump told reporters: “Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line”.“They were getting yippy, you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid.”But with the US president determined to reshape the global trading system, whatever the cost, the yips are here to stay.Explore more on these topicsAustralian economyTrump tariffsStock marketsBusinessInternational tradeanalysisShareReuse this content"

By this point, he’s been to six of them in the last seven days – mostly cleared of regular punters – selling his party’s promise to bring down petrol costs by about $14 per car a week. Economic analystsput that estimate a lot lower– about $7.56.Dutton tight-lipped over how many voluntary redundancies would be offered in public service cuts planRead more“Are you related to Albanese?” Sammy asks, peppering Dutton with questions he can’t duck and weave from like in a regular press conference.Sammy’s unexpected intervention at a Caulfield petrol station lasts just two minutes – and is a rare moment in an otherwise scrupulously controlled federal election campaign.Before Sammy wandered through the tangle of cameramen with their lenses on Dutton, the only people attending the seven-minute bowser visit were politicians, their staffers, media and the petrol station staff, who were informed of the impending visit.The meticulous planning is a regular feature of the modern Australian election but 2025 marks another change in how tightly scripted every handshake, smile, wave and petrol fill up has been.The Australian federal policewarned in Marchthreats against elected officials have continued to rise. In the first days of both major parties’ campaigns, protesters crashed press conferences, masquerading as media and capturing headlines about their causes.View image in fullscreenPeter Dutton visits a steel facility in Erskine Park, in western Sydney on day 11 of the election campaign, Wednesday, 9 April 2025.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPFor those in the press pack, these interventions add colour and movement to the day’s story – a welcome addition for media trying to attract attention from a public typically uninterested or disillusioned by the political news cycle. But for politicians and protective personnel, these breaches demonstrate how quickly threats can become disasters if the intruders have violent intentions.While the threat might be very real, further locking down a politician’s visit results in an even more sanitised campaign.Australia is a fortnight into a five-week election campaign and there’s seldom a glimpse in the nightly news of leaders having unvetted public interactions, let alone on social media.For two men vying to become leaders of the Australian people, neither have spent very much time with them – those outside the political class anyway.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterWhile a public street walk was already a rarity in previous elections, it’s now a national security risk.Both the public and the media are worse off for it, but politicians are too. When public trust in democratic institutions is at an all-time low, genuine engagement with the public, without all the smoke and mirrors, is crucial.On Friday, Dutton denied there had been any changes this election campaign because of security concerns.Albanese says ‘nonsensical’ Dutton plan to axe vehicle efficiency standard fines won’t lower fuel costsRead more“It hasn’t stopped me from doing anything, and it won’t on this campaign,” he said.“I think this is an opportunity to speak to the Australian people, to see as many people as humanly possible, and we’ll continue that over the course of the campaign.”Bringing order to the press packBack in Dutton’s camp, the mood and strategy has shifted.After a train wreck opening campaign week, the former policeman turned property investor turned MP is taking back control.At the start of the week, theCoalitionannounced a spectacular about-face on its working from home policy, worried it was further bleeding votes from women. It also sought to put to bed some of the confusion around its promise to sack 41,000 public servants.While many questions still remain about how the opposition would actually achieve the target with no forced redundancies, the opposition at least ruled out immediate mass cuts in Canberra.On Tuesday, after Dutton apologised for the misstep – something the former Coalition prime minister often refrains from – the opposition leader was back in charge.Dutton muzzled the press pack in a way Albanese has often struggled to achieve. Instead of pitting travelling journalists against each other in order to get Dutton’s attention during press conferences, the opposition leader has prioritised order.In three press conferences between Wednesday and Friday, Dutton methodically gave each journalist a question in order of where they were standing.View image in fullscreenDutton at a press conference after visiting a manufacturing facility in Bayswater, in eastern Melbourne on day 13 of the campaign, Thursday, 10 April 2025.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPThe result meant media didn’t scream over one another to get their questions in. It also gave Dutton time to respond to each answer and disrupted any control the press pack might have tried to gain over a politician only wanting to deliver speaking points, not answers.In a staid, scripted election campaign, press conferences can offer the only windows into a politician’s mindset, or sometimes the cracks in their facade. It’s not about the media gaining a scalp, but showing the unpolished parts of a person hellbent on being a perfect specimen for voters.The whole script for election campaigns should be thrown out, but that’s unlikely to happen, given the major parties enjoy the political conventions that benefit them. And it’s unclear what an election campaign without the major political parties controlling them could even look like.In the absence of difficult press conferences and leaders visiting real voters in real scenarios, it is more challenging for the Australian public to determine which leader makes the most sense for them.Personal safety and control is paramount for those who want to lead, but it can only lead to worse outcomes for democratic institutions if it comes at the cost of genuine engagement.And genuine engagement should not be defined by campaign managers and political party strategists.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Peter DuttonAustralian politicsCoalitionanalysisShareReuse this content"

However, he does not know exactly why the chopper came down.New York helicopter crash was ‘entirely predictable’, say campaignersRead moreAs well as the pilot, the crash killed five members of a Spanish family. The victims were identified as Agustín Escobar, an executive of the technology company Siemens, his wife, Mercè Camprubí, who was celebrating her 40th birthday, and their three children, aged 10, eight and four, according to Eric Adams, the New York mayor.The middle child would have celebrated their ninth birthday on Friday, Adams said.Steven Fulop, the Jersey City mayor, said a relative was arriving from Spain on Friday to take home the family members’ remains.The pilot has not yet been officially named, and the firm did not immediately respond to a request from the Guardian for comment.But a report on Friday afternoon fromthe Gothamistidentified the pilot as Sean Johnson, a 36-year-old veteran of the Navy Seals who had recently moved to New York City to continue his aviation career, according to family members and his Facebook profile.Johnson’s wife, Kathryn, told the outlet that after his military career he took on a variety of jobs, including on a TV show and as a bodyguard for celebrities – but that through it all, Johnson “always wanted to fly”,Kathryn said that she was struggling to process news of his death. “ It’s just hard right now,” she said.Divers returned to the river early on Friday morning to salvage sections of the helicopter. Fulop said “major parts” of the Bell 206 chopper broke apart in midair and plunged into the water.Videos posted on social media captured large chunks of the helicopter, including rotor blades spinning independently of the fuselage, falling from the sky and splashing into the river on Thursday afternoon, not long after the tourist flight had taken off from a popular heliport at the tip of Manhattan.Other footage showed the aircraft mostly submerged, upside down in the water, and rescue vehicles crowding the streets in New Jersey as emergency workers raced in.View image in fullscreenEmergency divers respond to the scene where a helicopter crashed in the Hudson River in Jersey City, New Jersey, on Thursday.Photograph: David Dee Delgado/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThe Hudson River divides the west side of Manhattan from New Jersey and flows into New York harbor past the Statue of Liberty. The weather on Thursday afternoon featured gray skies, light winds and cold rain.On Friday, witnesses spoke of the shocking moments shortly after 3pm when the sightseeing helicopter, operated by New York Helicopter Tours, broke into pieces about 16 minutes into flight.“I heard very loud sounds, I thought it had to be gunshots, it was that level loud,” Dani Horbiak toldABC’s Good Morning America.Six people killed after helicopter crashes into Hudson River in New YorkRead more“When I looked out my window I saw a helicopter falling into pieces. It all happened in seconds.”Another witness, Bruce Wall, said he also saw the helicopter breaking up in flight.“I heard some crackling, looked up, and I just see a plane falling apart,” he said. “The tail broke off and the plane tumbled into the water with the propeller still in the air.”Sean Duffy, the US transportation secretary, said officials from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) were on site and leading the investigation, and that the aircraft was not being monitored by air traffic controllers on the ground at the time it crashed.Tributes were paid in Spain to Escobar, 49, chief executive of rail infrastructure at Siemens Mobility, and his family, who were enjoying a sightseeing excursion of New York City.Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, posted to X on Friday: “We have had devastating news about the helicopter accident in the Hudson River.“Five Spaniards from the same family, three of them children, lost their lives along with the pilot. It’s an unimaginable tragedy. I share the pain of the victims’ loved ones in this heartbreaking moment.”View image in fullscreenA crane lifts the wreckage of a helicopter that crashed into the Hudson River in Jersey City on Thursday.Photograph: Seth Wenig/APSpain’s transport minister, Óscar Puente, said : “Reading with horror that the victims of the awful helicopter accident in the US were Agustín Escobar and his family. I met him over the past year in his capacity at Siemens Spain. He was a charming, hard-working and talented person.”1:21Helicopter crashes in Hudson River in New York – videoThe German industrial conglomerate Siemens confirmed that Escobar worked for the company as head of rail infrastructure at its mobility division.“We are deeply saddened by the tragic helicopter crash in which Agustín Escobar and his family lost their lives,” Siemens said in a statement.Camprubí, Escobar’s wife, was a global manager at an energy technology company.Fulop said in apost to Xon Friday that Escobar was in New York for work, and his family joined him for some leisure time.“I’m sharing this because life moves quick and we don’t always think about the fact it is unpredictable and extremely fragile,” he wrote.“The husband was here for a business trip and the family flew out to extend the trip a couple days in NYC. They were celebrating the mom’s 40th birthday with the tourist helicopter flight.”View image in fullscreenDivers search for the downed tourist helicopter in the Hudson River off Jersey City on Thursday.Photograph: Milo Hess/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockJessica Tisch, the New York City police commissioner, said most of the passengers were already dead when they were removed from the water, but two were taken to a nearby hospital, where they died soon after.Tisch said the helicopter took off from a downtown helicopter pad at about 3pm and flew north over the Hudson. It turned south when it reached the George Washington Bridge and crashed minutes later, hitting the water upside down and sinking near Lower Manhattan about 3.15pm, just off Hoboken, New Jersey.Justin Green, an aviation lawyer and former Marine Corps helicopter pilot, told the AP: “There’s no indication they had any control over the craft. No pilot could have prevented that accident once they lost the lifts. It’s like a rock falling to the ground.”Green added that videos of the crash suggest a “catastrophic mechanical failure” and it is possible the helicopter’s main rotors struck the tail boom, breaking it apart and causing the cabin to free fall.The agency said at least 38 people had died in helicopter accidents in New York City since 1977. A collision between a plane and a tourist helicopter over the Hudson in 2009 killed nine people, and five died in 2018 when a charter helicopter offering “open door” flights went down into the East River.Explore more on these topicsNew York helicopter crashNew YorkSpainAir transportHelicopter crashesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

After financial markets plummeted, the US presidentannounced a temporary reprieveon Wednesday, reducing tariffs on almost all other countries to his baseline of 10%. Car, steel and aluminium imports continue to face a higher tariff of 25%.The government is in advanced negotiations with the US overa trade dealto secure more favourable arrangements for the UK. However, Kevin Hassett, an economic adviser to Trump, told CNBC on Thursday that any deal that would persuade the president to go below 10% would need to be “extraordinary”.Asked if she was losing confidence in the prospect of a US trade deal, Rachel Reeves told reporters on Friday: “We continue to engage with our counterparts in the United States.”‘The damage is done’: Trump’s tariffs put the dollar’s safe haven status in jeopardyRead moreShe added: “At the same time, we also want to improve trading relations with other countries around the world. It’s why I hosted the Indian finance minister in London this week as part of our economic and financial dialogue, and to try and secure a free trade and investment treaty with India. It’s also why we are having a summit with the European Union in May to improve our trading relations.”The Guardian reported this week that the government had told businesses a free trade deal with India was 90% complete. Ministers are also putting stock in building economic ties with China, with the trade minister Douglas Alexander travelling to Beijing this week for talks.Liam Byrne, theLabourchair of the Commons business and trade committee, called for a “big, ambitious reset” with the EU and said it would “deliver an economic uplift bigger than the hit we are going to take from tariffs”.He said: “We need to prioritise our trading relationship with the EU because it is big and close … There is a real frustration in Brussels about the UK not being clearer in what it wants in the reset. This is in the EU’s interest, the UK’s interest, and the urgency of the situation demands that we crack on with this.”Stella Creasy, a Labour MP and chair of the Labour Movement for Europe, said: “Get the deal with Europe. Stop talking about red lines. We have shown we can work with Europe on defence security and our economies are intertwined … we do five times as much trade with Europe as with America.“At the moment, we have tariff-free trade with Europe but we have a massive drop in trade because of all the paperwork. There are many ways we could negotiate to remove those barriers and get a sugar rush of growth from improving trading with our neighbours.”Harriet Harman, the former cabinet minister and Labour peer, said ministers needed to address “the elephant in the room, which is that Trump is wrong on this, we don’t agree with him”.Speaking to Sky News’ Electoral Dysfunction podcast, Harman said that when the USput tariffs on imported steel in 2002, Tony Blair “did say this is unacceptable, this is wrong, it’s unjustified, it is breaching the World Trade Organization rules”.“He was able to say we do not believe this is how you should be within the world organisation and Bush has got it wrong,” she added. “I think it feels as if there’s a kind of restricted vocabulary amongst ministers at the moment where they are speaking in code.“I think the story needs to be told to the country that this is a really difficult problem and Trump has caused it and he is wrong to do this, but we will be OK with this government,” Harman said.Hassett told CNBC this week: “Everybody expects that the 10% baseline tariff is going to be the baseline. It is going to take some kind of extraordinary deal for the president to go below there.”Starmeradmitted on Thursdaythat he had not spoken to Trump since the tariffs were introduced.Explore more on these topicsLabourTrade policyEconomic policyTrump tariffsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

His forces continue to fire on Ukraine, military and civilian targets alike.”The UK and Germany jointly convened Friday’s Ramstein meeting, which was attended by more than 40 countries but not the US. Pete Hegseth, Trump’s defence secretary, joined by video instead.Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, played down the Trump administration’s absence. He conceded that peace “appears to be out of reach in the immediate future” and said Ukraine was at the “epicentre of a broader conflict”.View image in fullscreenGermany’s Boris Pistorius said Ukraine was at the ‘epicentre of a broader conflict’.Photograph: Omar Havana/Getty“It is between freedom and oppression, between the recognition of global standards and aggressive imperialism, between democracy and authoritarianism,” Pistorius said, adding that military support for Ukraine would continue.The US’s attempts to bring about a quick end to the war have so far not succeeded. Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, held talks on Friday with Putin’s investment aide, Kirill Dmitriev, in St Petersburg. This followed avisit last weekby Dmitriev to Washington.Witkoff was also due to meet Putin, as the Kremlin cautioned that no breakthroughs and “nothing momentous” should be expected.Ukraine war briefing: Europe unveils new military support for Kyiv ahead of defence summitRead moreIn conversations with the White House,Russiahas refused to make concessions. Moscow demands control over four Ukrainian regions, the removal of Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s pro-western government and a ban on Nato membership for Ukraine. It also wants the lifting of sanctions.Trump issued a rare warning to Putin before the meeting on his social media platform, Truth Social. “Russia has to get moving. Too many people ere [sic] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war – A war that should have never happened, and wouldn’t have happened, if I were President!!!” he wrote.Trump has previously said he is“pissed off” by Putin’s failure to stop fightingbut he has not taken any serious measures to put pressure on Russia’s president. In interviews, Witkoff has parroted Kremlin talking points, telling the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that Russian-occupied Ukrainian regions had voted to join Moscow.The US envoy to Ukraine, Gen Keith Kellogg, appeared to echo such suggestions in an interview with the Times on Friday, in which he said that a demilitarised zone between Ukrainian and Russian forces could be established along the existing frontline.He also said that British and French troops could adopt zones of control in the west of the country as part of a “reassurance force”.“You could almost make it look like what happened with Berlin after World War Two, when you had a Russian zone, a French zone, and a British zone, a US zone,” he said.Since Ukraine agreed to a US ceasefire last month, Russia has dramaticallyescalatedits aerial bombing campaign. This week it launched a big military push in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions, seizing several border villages.There is speculation Russia is trying to grab as much territory as possible by 9 May, the day Russia celebrates its victory during the second world war, and before a possible peace deal.Estonia’s defence minister, Hanno Pevkur, said: “This is why we need to speed up the deliveries as quickly as we can.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This week a Russian ballistic missilehit a playgroundin the city of Kryvyi Rih, where Zelenskyy grew up, killing nine children and 11 adults.“Our priority is air defence. Patriots that remained unused in storage with our partners should be protecting lives,” Zelenskyysaid, adding that 10 more were urgently needed.Speaking at apress conferenceafter the Ramstein meeting, Pistorius said Germany had already given four Patriot systems to Kyiv and was waiting for more to be delivered. He said a global search was under way. “We will buy anything we can get,” he said.Germany will provide four Iris-T air defence systems as well as 15 Leopard 1 tanks, more reconnaissance drones and 100,000 artillery rounds, he added. Other governments announced fresh contributions.Healey said the UK and Norway would supply radar systems, anti-tank mines and “hundreds of thousands of drones” as part of a $560m defence package, on top of £4.5bn committed by Downing Street this year. The figure includes the repair of military vehicles damaged on the battlefield.Friday’s meeting did not clarify how many countries were ready to send troops to Ukraine as part of a “coalition of the willing”. Speaking to the BBC, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “Different member states have different opinions”. Discussions were still taking place, she added.The UK, France and Baltic nations have said they will put boots on the ground in the event of a peace settlement. AFP reported that six nations had signed up.Healey said planning for a so-called reassurance force was “real, substantial and well-advanced”. It envisages foreign soldiers being deployed away from the 1,000km-long frontline and boosting existing Ukrainian ground forces, he suggested.Russia has categorically rejected the idea. Sweden’s defence minister, Pål Jonson, said Stockholm needed answers to “a number of questions” before it could make a commitment. “It’s helpful if there’s a clarity of what that mission would entail, and what do we do – if we are peacekeeping, deterrence or reassurance,” he said.The UK has said the US military “backstop” – meaning comprehensive air cover – is essential for any mission to work. The Trump administration, however, has ruled this out and has indicated that Ukraine’s future security needs are now Europe’s problem.The Biden administration set up the Ukraine defence contact group after Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion and chaired meetings. In February the US relinquished this leadership role, handing it over to London and Berlin. Hegseth said the Trump administration had priorities elsewhere – in Asia and on America’s own borders.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaNatoEuropeJohn HealeyDefence policynewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to acquire the island and has not ruled out military or economic force to do so.The US Space Force said in a statement on Thursday night that Meyers had been removed from the position of commander on Thursday due to a “loss of confidence” in her ability to lead.“Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties,” it added.Vance’s posturing in Greenland was not just morally wrong. It was strategically disastrous | Timothy SnyderRead moreThe statement did not expand further, but the US websiteMilitary.comsaid Meyers sent an email to all personnel at Pituffik on 31 March “seemingly aimed at generating unity among the airmen and guardians, as well as the Canadians, Danes and Greenlanders who work there, following Vance’s appearance”.Vance visited the base on 28 March in a trip that was substantially changed at the last minute amid increasingly strained relations between the US, Greenland andDenmark. During the visit he told troops that the US had to gain control of the Arctic island to stop the threat of China and Russia. He also criticised Denmark, which he said had “not done a good job by the people of Greenland”.Originally, the delegation had been planned to be led by his wife, the second lady, Usha Vance, who had been scheduled to visit the capital, Nuuk, and a dog sled race in Sisimiut. But after outrage over the timing after the election – the new coalition government had yet to be sworn in – the plans were changed.The vice-president said during a press conference at the base: “Our message to Denmark is very simple: you have not done a good job by the people of Greenland. You have underinvested in the people of Greenland and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful land mass.”1:20JD Vance accuses Denmark of neglecting Greenland and calls for self-determination – videoIn her email Meyers wrote: “I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the US administration discussed by vice-president Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik space base.”The Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said on X: “Actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump’s agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defence.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her only child, Michal Olszewski, 52, an aeronautical engineer and dual British-Polish citizen, who lives in Lincoln with his wife, had been travelling regularly to the Polish capital to support his mother.As his mother had become increasingly frail he wanted her to move to the UK so he and his wife could care for her properly.Olszewska arrived in the UK last year on a six-month visitor visa. Shortly afterwards, an application containing the correct information was made online for her to live permanently in Britain with her son and his wife.On 25 March, the Home Office responded, informing the family: “Unfortunately your application is not valid and we are unable to accept it … The required application process for someone applying as a family member of a relevant naturalised British citizen is to use the appropriate paper form.“Your application was made online. There is no right of appeal in respect of an invalid application.”Owing to the delay in Home Office officials informing Olszewska that the wrong form had been completed, her visitor visa had expired and she had become an overstayer.The letter warned her that the consequences of staying in Britain unlawfully included being detained, fined and imprisoned, along with being removed and banned from returning to the UK.After the Guardian highlighted the case, the Home Office emailed the correct form to print and post back to them – and within days it approved the application, granting five years pre-settled status under the EU settlement scheme.A very different letter was sent by the Home Office this time, stating: ‘I am pleased to inform you …” and confirming the right to work, use the NHS and study in the UK.The case received widespread attention in the UK and inPoland. One elderly British man even offered to marry Olszewska. He said he was not looking for a relationship but wanted to make the offer as a gesture of Polish-British friendship.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tickets sold out almost immediately.Under a military escort in bulletproof buses, small groups will travel up to 2.5km into Syrian territory that was off limits until the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) seized the Golan buffer zone afterthe fall of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in December. Israel has occupied the Golan Heights since 1967 and now controls hundreds more square kilometres of Syrian land.Fear and uncertainty in Golan Heights as Israeli troops drive deeper into SyriaRead moreThe itinerary includes the Syrian side of Mount Hermon, which overlooks Damascus, and Lebanon’s Shebaa Farms at the foot of the mountain. The Israeli-occupied strip of Lebanese land, reputedly the site of God’s covenant with Abraham, has been a flashpoint for violence between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for decades.Visitors will also be able to hike and swim in the Ruqqad river valley which flows into the Yarmouk on the border with Jordan, and see parts of the abandoned Ottoman Hejaz railway, which used to connect the empire’s capital in Istanbul to Haifa, Nablus and holy sites in present day Saudi Arabia.The trips have been organised by the IDF’s 210th Division, the Golan regional council, the Keshet Yehonatan religious education centre, the environmentalist Golan Field School and the Israel nature and parks authority, the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported.The tours are part of a wider initiative, “Returning to a Safer North”, after the end of last year’s Israel-Hezbollah war, which was part of the regional fallout ignited by Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel and the ensuing war in the Gaza Strip.The Israeli military said: “It’s important for us to restore heritage and tourism to the region and to tell the story of the battles fought during the war.”Tourists sign up at their own risk and the trips may be cancelled at short notice if there are security issues. In response to questions from Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the IDF said that the tour was “inside Israel”, rather than Syria, although the visits take place in the Golan Heights demilitarised buffer zone, internationally recognised as Syrian territory.The IDF began a heavy bombing campaign across Syriatargeting the regime’s weapons stockpiles shortly after Assad fled the country, while ground troops advanced in violation of a 1974 agreement.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has demanded that forces belonging to Syria’s new Islamist-led transitional government stay away from the border area and that the IDF remain until an alternative arrangement can be found.Given demand, organisers have said that they hope the security situation will permit additional tours to Syria after Passover.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Surrey police tracked the devices to Brown’s mother’s house in Cobham, Surrey, and later accepted the devices belonged to her children and she was “entitled” to confiscate them.“I find it quite traumatic even talking about this now,” Brown said.“At no point did [the officers] think to themselves, ‘Oh, this is a little bit of an overreaction for a moment, confiscating temporarily her [own] iPads and popping over to her mum’s to have a coffee’. It was just a complete overreaction.”She added: “It was thoroughly unprofessional. They were speaking to my mother, who is in her 80s, like she was a criminal.”Surrey police said a search for the devices began after a man in his 40s reported the theft of two iPads to officers who attended an address in Cobham, following a report of a “concern for safety”.Parents arrested by Hertfordshire police for complaining about daughter’s schoolRead moreCh Supt Aimee Ramm, Surrey police’s northern divisional commander, said: “This led officers to carry out further enquiries at a second address, where a 50-year-old woman from Cobham was questioned about the iPads and denied any knowledge of their whereabouts.“However, a tracking device on the iPads showed that they were at the address. Officers encouraged the woman to return the items and resolve the matter, however the woman did not cooperate and therefore she was arrested on suspicion of theft. A search was then carried out using post-arrest powers and the iPads were located.“During this time, officers called South East Coast ambulance to attend the address following a further concern for safety.”Brown told LBC she was taken to Staines police station, where she was searched and had fingerprints and custody shots taken, before being placed in a cell.She said she was not able to return to her mother’s home until almost 12 hours after police first arrived, and was left in a “catatonic state” as a result of the experience.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All these police cars and police officers going into address over a completely false report of a theft.”Surrey police said Brown was released on conditional bail while further enquiries were carried out to establish the ownership of the iPads.Ramm said: “The police bail conditions included not speaking to anyone connected to the investigation, including her daughters, while officers carried out their enquiries.“Following these enquiries, officers were able to verify that the iPads belonged to the woman’s children, and that she was entitled to confiscate these items from her own children. The case was therefore closed the following day with no further action being taken and the bail conditions which had been set were then no longer applicable.“Officers did attend the daughter’s school – however this was in relation to the initial concern for safety.”Explore more on these topicsSurreyPoliceEnglandChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

The company’s owner, Jingye, has said it is losing about £700,000 a day.The issue of nationalisation will be dealt with separately and is not certain to happen, but senior sources said it was the likely outcome and the government would look at potential private sector partners for a transfer of ownership and co-investment.The company declined to comment and it remains unclear how Jingye will respond to being directed by the UK government.Government sources said generous offers had been made to the Chinese company that any rational actor would have accepted, and that the UK was taking action to keep the furnaces going in order to continue talks about the next steps. Once they had been allowed to stop, the furnaces would be impossible to restart.Speaking on Friday, Starmer said the “future of British steel hangs in the balance” and he would not stand by while the last blast furnaces in the UK were closed, shutting an essential industry.The GMB union said the move looked like “the first step in the process” of nationalisation, saying it was the only way to save the UK steel industry.“The business secretary must be given huge praise for acting decisively to safeguard this vital industry and the thousands of jobs that rely on it,” the union said.A No 10 spokesperson said: “The prime minister has been clear, his government will always act in the national interest. All actions we take are in the name of British industry, British jobs and for British workers.“Tomorrow, parliament will be recalled to debate the steel industry (special measures) bill. The bill provides the government with the power to direct steel companies in England, which we will use to protect the Scunthorpe site. It enables the UK government to preserve capability and ensure public safety. It also ensures all options remain viable for the future of the plant and the livelihoods it supports.“We have been negotiating with British Steel’s owners in good faith ever since coming to office. We have always been clear there is a bright future for steel in the UK. All options remain on the table.”The Commons will sit at 11am, with MPs called back from Easter recess to discuss putting the assets under public control. The government will aim to get emergency legislation through the Commons and Lords in one day of sitting.Labour MPs have been told to tell their whips where they are and to make all efforts to return to Westminster to ensure the passage of the legislation.The Guardian view on steel on the brink: Britain’s last blast furnaces face extinction | EditorialRead moreThis week government sources said nationalising British Steel was not easy, and would be a measure of last resort.The last time parliament was recalled during recess was in 2021, whenAfghanistan had to be evacuatedduring the Taliban takeover. It is also the first recall of parliament on a Saturday since 1982.One MP said the move was “going down extremely badly” with colleagues who had been given no warning about the need to return to Westminster, when it had been known for weeks that British Steel was in trouble.Some opposition parties were also furious that other industrial plants in trouble had not been given the same treatment from the government. Plaid Cymru said “the people of Wales would not forget” that the steel plant at Port Talbot was allowed to close its blast furnaces and convert to electric arc production, while the SNP highlighted the different treatment for Grangemouth – Scotland’s only oil refinery, which could close. Government sources said those plants were facing different situations.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said the government had “bungled” the negotiations with British Steel.“They must have seen this coming for a while,” she said. “Instead of addressing it earlier in the week when parliament was sitting, their incompetence has led to a last-minute recall of parliament.”British Steel makes the vast majority of UK rail track and the government has been seeking a deal to keep the plant open.The industry will be hit by a25% tariff on steel exportsto the US imposed by Donald Trump but the government has insisted British Steel’s problems are not related to this.Talks with Jingye’s chair, Li Ganpo, had dragged on for three days after the government offered to buy raw materials to keep the plant running for the next few weeks while trying to find a longer-term solution.Scunthorpe is the last remaining steelworks capable of making steel from iron ore and so is seen by some people as strategically important for the UK. However, Jingye last month said itplanned to close the plant’s two blast furnaces, putting 2,700 jobs at risk. It has since refused to pay for new raw materials, with coal and iron ore deliveries to Immingham port not yet paid for.The government had offered £500m in financial support to switch the blast furnaces to cleaner electric arc furnaces, but Jingye had requested much more.Talks this week are thought to have stalled when Jingye balked at the conditions attached to the offer to pay for new raw materials. The delays in reaching an agreement had caused increasing alarm among workers, who feared at least one blast furnace might be forced to close as soon as next week, leading to job losses.Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelHouse of CommonsSteel industrynewsShareReuse this content"

This was a wholly unevidenced and inherently implausible case.”At Friday’s conclusion of the trial, which began on 7 March, Millar said that allegations made by Clarke about the motives of the Guardian’s witnesses and its journalists had been shown to be a “complete nonsense”.The conspiracy theory, he said, was “a case born of necessary invention”. Millar said Clarke had “a very clear motive to lie”.For Clarke, Philip Williams said that his client was the victim of an industry attempting to correct itself after the #MeToo movement. He highlighted the Benny Hill and Little Britain series and Carry On films as productions that would now be considered “inappropriate”.He said, in written submissions: “Mr Clarke, with his success despite his outsider status and as a clear product of that time, was simply a casualty of this purge. It represents illiterate historical revisionism and completely ignores any nuance or context.”He told the court: “The court will realise that the Guardian has manifestly failed to do its job properly. They approached the destruction of this man’s life with a cavalier, haphazard and negligent attitude which can only be described as competitive ignorance.”The WitnessesDuring the course of the trial, the Guardian argued two defences: that the allegations in the articles were true and that they were also in the public interest.The court heard from 28 “truth” witnesses who had been prepared to sign statements for the Guardian, included 21 “key witnesses” who said they had experienced misconduct by Clarke themselves or directly witnessed it.Millar said that their evidence supported the claims against Clarke, which were made up of several elements.They were that:Over 15 years, he used his power to prey on and harass female colleagues.He sometimes bullied female colleagues.He engaged in unwanted sexual contact, kissing, touching or groping.He engaged in sexually inappropriate behaviour and comments.He was involved in professional misconduct.He took and shared explicit pictures and videos without consent, including secretly filming a young actor’s naked audition.“The truth witnesses who gave evidence for [the Guardian] have all come up to proof. They have no reason at all to lie and every reason not to,” Millar said.In oral submissions, he told the court that Clarke’s position was that “every one of them is lying about something or, when he can’t remember, then they must be lying because he wouldn’t have said or done what they allege. It’s an extraordinary position to take … That high number [of witnesses] is against him. It’s inherently improbable.”Millar said that that witnesses were variously corroborated by other people and documentary evidence. For example, Jing Lusi messaged a friend a day or too after dinner with Clarke saying she had been “Me-Too-ed” at work, while Imogen*, who, as a “wide-eyed” 20-year-old, said she was propositioned over dinner by Clarke and found him “sexually threatening” wrote a contemporary, unpublished Tumblr post about her experience.Williams said in written submissions that the Guardian had sought to rely on a handful of people who “were plotting and carrying out their scheme from 2019 to bring about Mr Clarke’s downfall, based on vitriolic hatred, professional jealousy, classist snobbery and insidious racialised bias”.He told the court: “The alleged complainants, and the others involved in the campaign, were not acting independently.” As such, he said the court was “not confronted with 20-plus individual complainants, but an interlinked network”.The court heard that five of Clarke’s witnesses did not turn up and Millar said that excepting one, Clarke “could not produce a single witness to support or corroborate his version of events on the key factual issues”.He described Clarke’s witnesses as, bar his wife, “male friends of his who apparently attended trial out of loyalty to him”.Williams said some of Clarke’s potential witnesses had been “frightened off”, claiming that the actor’s former assistant, Gina Powell, and one of his accusers, had sought to “discredit” several with “flawed allegations” made against them.Public interestSeveral Guardian journalists gave evidence during the trial to argue the publication of the articles was in the public interest.In his written submissions, Millar said: “They have no reason at all to lie and every reason not to. And the evidence has shown overwhelmingly that [the Guardian’s] assessment that publication of the articles in issue was in the public interest was not only reasonable, it was correct.”One of the Guardian’s reporters, Lucy Osborne, was described by Millar as “an obviously truthful witness who, as with her colleagues, had impressive command of the detail of the investigation notwithstanding the passage of time”.Sirin Kale, her reporting colleague, and Paul Lewis, the Guardian’s investigations editor, were described as “considered, thoughtful and concerned to assist the court in understanding the work they undertook”.“They were careful witnesses who were conscious at the time of the significance and potential consequences of publication.”Williams’s written submissions on behalf of Clarke contained diagrams of what were described as “primary connections” and “secondary connections” between the actor’s accusers – connections which he said the Guardian should have been aware of.He said the claims against Clarke were “a stitch-up” and that this should have been apparent to the Guardian.Williams said the public interest defence should fail because there was “a lack of verification for some of these major issues that they could not have believed that the allegations were fit for publication”.Millar told the court that the claimant had raised “granular points” in relation to the evidence considered by reporters to try to undermine them.He also dismissed suggestions there were racial undertones to the investigation, saying there was “unsurprisingly no evidence whatsoever” to support the claim.He described the diagram showing purported links between the accusers as “childish” and said that attempts to substantiate the alleged conspiracy as consisting of “speculative questioning and attempts to fish for a case by asking about connections between witnesses and supposed sources”.He told the court: “This was a careful, and thorough, investigation conducted conscientiously by Guardian journalists who were aware of the potential pitfalls.“They received information from a wide range of sources with direct evidence of misconduct and in each case carefully considered and tested the information they were given, electing to publish only such information as they believed was credible. In testing those accounts they did all that could be reasonably expected of them.“They published the allegations accurately and in the case of every published allegation also set out [Clarke’]s response to the allegation. Their belief that publication of the articles was in the public interest cannot be faulted. It was plainly a reasonable belief.”In his written submissions, Millar said the evidence of Viner, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, and her deputy, Owen Gibson, went unchallenged.“It must be accepted by [Clarke] that it was Ms Viner who took the decision that it was in the public interest to publish and she did so in good faith based on the factors she sets out in her evidence.”Clarke’s denialsClarke variously accused his accusers of lying, embellishing incidents and having axes to grind.Williams said: “Complainants were ‘carefully curated’, and encouraged to cooperate with one another in order to create and embellish their complaints.”But he also denied that incidents described by witnesses amounted to sexual misconduct.In contrast to the evidence given by witnesses, Williams described some of the incidents as nothing more than “tapping of a leg for practical purposes, bad taste jokes, unbefitting banter, consensual sex and photographs, and purported threats to silence”.He said: “Mr Clarke was classified as a ‘serial abuser’ – rhetorically, what is the abuse? … Out of this of sea of insinuations and innuendoes, trying to identify actual instances of sexual harassment (which attain the threshold of s.26 of the Equality Act) or sexual assault is akin to finding needles in a haystack.”Making a point about changing standards over time, Williams also said: “The lens of 20 years ago is not the lens of today.”But Millar said rather than admitting fault, Clarke had “made unpersuasive but revealing efforts to normalise and/or excuse conduct that most people would find – and would have found whether 10 or 20 years ago – offensive and unacceptable”.He said the evidence had “shown [Clarke] to be precisely the man depicted in … [the] articles, who has brought this case to trial on an entirely false basis”.Millar referred disparagingly to Clarke’s suggestion that one of his accusers had been motived to perjure herself because of her belief in “women’s rights”.He said Clarke “was an unreliable witness whose evidence on the factual issues should not be believed”.As an example, he cited Clarke’s response to allegations made by one woman that she experienced unwanted sexual touching by Clarke during the filming of a sex scene.Millar said that key aspects of Clarke’s evidence “were admitted by him to be false”, including that he had supported himself on his left leg throughout the scene when the film shows his hips right up against the woman’s.“All these misstatements contributed to a false narrative of the shooting of the scene,” Millar said.He told the high court that Clarke had produced “worthless evidence”.“The evidence which the court has heard shows overwhelmingly that [Clarke’s] case must fail,” Millar told the court. “[The Guardian’s] investigative journalism, and the witnesses who gave evidence of their knowledge of [Clarke’s] extensive misconduct, have been vindicated.”The judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, will give her judgment at a later date.*Not their real nameExplore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeGuardian Media GroupThe GuardiannewsShareReuse this content"

This weekend, parliament will sit for the first Saturday in decades as it tries to keep the last two furnaces running for a bit longer.Keir Starmer has recalled MPs to discuss emergency powers to direct steel companies, including British Steel’s Scunthorpe steelworks, to “preserve capability and ensure public safety”. The move would be short of nationalisation, but it would give the government more influence on the steel industry than at any point since Margaret Thatcher.The government is scrambling to save Scunthorpe after its Chinese owner, Jingye Steel Group, last month said it was considering closing it, with thelikely loss of 2,700 jobs. Starmer and the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, hope to keep the plant running for the next few weeks while they work out the longer-term plan, with nationalisation one option.British Steel is facing a crisis within a crisis: in the short term – the next week or so – it needs materials, including iron pellets and coking coal, or else it faces the prospect of the furnaces cooling beyond easy or affordable recovery. Customers would flee, making job losses inevitable.People with knowledge of this week’s talks between the UK government and Jingye said it appeared that the government had run out of patience with the Chinese company’s negotiating. The government had offered to buy the raw materials to keep the blast furnaces running in the short term but that offer was not taken up. Parliament may be able to avert the short-term crisis on Saturday.Union leaders representing steelworkers said they were relieved that the government appeared to be moving towards public ownership. Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, a former Scunthorpe steelworker and national officer for the GMB union, said nationalisation was “the only way to save the UK steel industry”, and that the ability to direct the company’s actions was “the first step in that process”.Yet even nationalisation will not deliver Scunthorpe’s workers from the bigger questions over its long-term future. Jingye had rejected a £500m offer of support to switch to electric arc furnaces – to match aid given to Tata Steel at Port Talbot, south Wales – but Scunthorpe will need to make the switch if it is to have a future in a world of net zero carbon emissions.The struggling Scunthorpe plant has passed between many owners since theprivatisation of the UK steel industry in 1988. Its Indian former owner Tata Steel sold it to the private equity firm Greybull Capital in 2016, only for Greybull to exit in 2019. Jingye stepped in with a deal hurriedly agreed under Boris Johnson’s premiership to buy the plant out of insolvency.Jingye’s timing appears to have been unfortunate. Since it took over, British Steel has lost a cumulative £350m, according to accounts up to the end of 2023. The company was not helped by the turbulence of the coronavirus crisis and a global glut as the vast Chinese industry, producer of more than half the world’s steel, tried to find buyers.That was before Donald Trump’s tariffs added to the turmoil, making exports to the US more expensive and threatening a global recession.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So the steel industry has been reassured that Labour has so far appeared committed to a manifesto pledge to invest £2.5bn in the sector, which has surviveddeep cuts to spending on international aidandbenefits.That commitment will be tested to its limit if Labour decides to take ownership of a steelworks that is losing money and needs hundreds of millions of pounds of investment. But the chance to guide a nationalised UK steel industry into the decarbonisation revolution will also have its attractions.Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelSteel industryEconomic policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Hochman submitted a motion to withdraw Gascón’s request, saying he did not support the brothers’ resentencing because they had not confessed to lies they told as the case unfolded about why they killed their parents and did not “fully recognize, acknowledge, and accept complete responsibility” for their crime.The Menendez brothers’ resentencing hearings are scheduled for 17 and 18 April.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaLos AngelesWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Species-recovery grants, habitat conservation and restoration, and the interjurisdictional fisheries grant program, which supports coordinated management and research with the states, would all lose funding. The document also outlines a plan to move the NMFS under the US Fish and Wildlife Service.Noaa is facing a $1.3bn cut to overall operations and research, with various programs on the chopping block, and the National Ocean Service would be cut in half.Science done outside the agency would also be undermined with cuts to Noaa’s climate research grants program, which provides roughly $70m a year.Noaa fires hundreds of climate workers after court clears way for dismissalsRead more“It’s a really disturbing and concerning development – but I would say it is not all that surprising,” Spinrad said of the plans outlined in the document, noting that there have been many indications the administration would take steps such as these. “But it also has an element of randomness associated with it,” he added. “There are specific programs called out, the reasons for which are absolutely not clear.”The fallout from cuts this deep, should Congress adopt the president’s plan, would be felt in communities around the world, and in far-ranging sectors, from agriculture to emergency management.“By making a complete divestiture in science and in our research enterprise, we are basically saying we are not interested in improving our quality of life or our economy,” Spinrad said.The administration also outlined plans to severely defund research at Nasa, the country’s space agency. The agency is slated for a 20% overall budget loss, but deeper cuts would be directed at programs overseeing planetary science, earth science and astrophysics research,accordingto Ars Technica,which first on Trump’s planswhen agency officials were briefed last month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionNow documents have been issued to back up those plans, halving funding for science atNasa.The plan for Nasa would also scrap a series of missions, including some that the federal government has already poured billions of taxpayer dollars into. The Nancy Grace Roman space telescope, which could offer glimpses into distant galaxies after its scheduled launch next year, is among them, along with the Mars Sample Return and the Davinci mission to Venus. The GoddardSpaceFlight Center in Maryland, which employs roughly 10,000 people, would also be closed.“This is an extinction-level event for Nasa science,” Casey Dreier, chief of space policy for the Planetary Society, told the Washington Post. “It needlessly terminates functional, productive science missions and cancels new missions currently being built, wasting billions of taxpayer dollars in the process. This is neither efficient nor smart budgeting.”Still not set in stone, these “passback” documents are a part of how the government goes about budgeting. They are issued by the White House to federal agencies before the discretionary budget is released and are seen as a guidance on presidential priorities. The numbers aren’t final and could be changed, and Congress will also have to act on the plans to finalize them.Spinrad is confident that many legislators won’t support the cuts. “Many of the actions put forward by [the White House’s office of management and budget] are in direct contradiction to congressional intent,” he said. “Zeroing out programs that Congress has worked hard to authorize over the years – that’s a clarion call to specific members and sponsors.”There’s also likely to be strong pushback from the public and from industries that rely on the tools and services made possible by the country’s scientists.But the drastic degree of these cuts also shows the administration’s position on climate science and its determination to hamper US research, experts say. That alone is enough to cause concern.“This proposal will cost lives,” McLean said of the document if it is enacted. “When a room full of doctors tell you that it’s cancer, firing the doctors does not cure you.”Explore more on these topicsNasaClimate scienceTrump administrationDonald TrumpSpaceUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

No governor in the state hasgranted clemencyto a death row defendant in the last 50 years of the modern death penalty era.The state resumed executions last year after a 13-year pause caused by its inability to procure lethal injection supplies. Officials now direct people on death row to choose their method of killing – either electric chair, lethal injection and firing squad. Mahdi’s lawyers said he selected the “lesser of three evils” and opted to be shot instead of “burned and mutilated in the electric chair, or suffering a lingering death on the lethal injection gurney”.The state’s firing squad protocols called for Mahdi to be strapped to a chair and shot by three prison employees aiming at a bullseye placed on the chest. Mahdigave no final statementand did not look toward the witnesses in the room, which included his lawyer.Mahdi cried out when he was shot, his arms flexed, and he groaned two more times roughly 45 seconds after the bullets were fired, according to an Associated Pressreporter, who served as a media witness. His breaths continued for roughly 80 seconds before he appeared to take a final gasp. He was pronounced dead around 6.05 pm, less than four minutes after he was shot.“Mikal Mahdi was a smart, creative, intellectually curious person who could have done so much more with his life. He just never got the chance,” his lawyer, David Weiss, said in a statement on Friday evening. “Tonight, the state of South Carolina executed him by firing squad – a horrifying act that belongs in the darkest chapters of history, not in a civilized society … We love Mikal and will miss him deeply.”Unlike the state’sfirst executionlast year of a man whopresented evidence of his innocencein his final days, Mahdi’s lawyers have not disputed his conviction or the facts of his case.His attorneys argued his constitutional rights were violated and that he should not have been sentenced to death, documenting an upbringing of violence and neglect in a US supreme court petition.Some of Mahdi’s earliest memories were of his father abusing his mother, who fled when he was four, and by age nine he was suicidal and briefly committed to a psychiatric facility. He did not get further treatment, and was homeschooled by his father who embraced conspiracy theories, the petition said. Mahdi entered the prison system as a young teen.View image in fullscreenMembers of South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty speak in Columbia, South Carolina, before presenting petitions to ask the governor to grant clemency to Mikal Mahdi on Thursday.Photograph: Jeffrey Collins/APBetween ages 14 and 21, Mahdi spent an estimated total of 8,000 hours in solitary confinement while incarcerated, enduring prolonged isolation in conditions now widely regarded as torture, his attorneys said.At age 21, two months after a release from prison, he committed a series of violent crimes, including robbing a convenience store, fatally shooting the clerk, fleeing police and breaking into a shed at Myers’s home and killing him.Mahdi pleaded guilty, but his trial lawyers failed to properly advocate for him at sentencing, his attorneys argued. While prosecutors called 28 witnesses, Mahdi’s attorneys at the time called two individuals, only one of whom offered minimal testimony on his history of trauma.The judge did not learn about instances of extreme violence committed by his father, Mahdi’s severe mental health crises at a young age, or that he had spent the vast majority of his teenage years imprisoned without getting necessary treatment, often languishing in solitary, his lawyers said.After Mahdi’s trial counsels presented “barely half an hour” of “mitigating evidence”, the judge sentenced him to death, saying Mahdi lacked “humanity” and that it didn’t seem as if his “turbulent and transient childhood … contributed in any significant way” to the crimes.The South Carolina’s attorney general’s office argued Mahdi had exhausted his appeals and that his claims of ineffectual counsel had already been litigated.“Mikal died in full view of the system that failed him at every turn – from childhood to his final breath … Mikal’s life was a testament to systemic neglect, and his death was its final, cruel punctuation mark,” said Weiss, an assistant federal public defender. “We condemn the violence done to him as a child, as an adolescent in prison, and as an adult. Mikal’s story of abuse and neglect by the state is sadly not unique – but for the state to condemn a man who they broke as a child is not only a tragedy, it’s a collective failure of empathy by our society and by our entire system of justice.”Life on South Carolina death row: months of ‘barbaric’ isolation before executionRead moreOn death row, Mahdi had spent time reading history and nonfiction and trying to learn Spanish by watching Telemundo, Weisstold the Guardianin an earlier interview. In his final days, he had also asked to have his organs donated after his death, but his attorneys were told healthcare protocols would bar the donations.Anti-death penalty advocates held vigils this week calling for McMaster to grant clemency, and two of Mahdi’selementary school teachersalso publicly urged for his life to be spared.Mahdi is the 12th person executedthis yearso far. His killing comes one month after South Carolina shot dead 67-year-old Brad Sigmon, who was the first personexecuted by firing squadin the US in 15 years. There have only been three other firing squad executions under the contemporary death penalty,all in Utah, but Idaho recentlypasseda law to make shooting theprimary execution methodin the state. Last month, Louisiana carried out a rare executionusing nitrogen gas, an experimental method banned under state law foreuthanizing dogs and cats.South Carolina has executed five people in the last seven months and continues to face scrutiny over thesecrecy of its methodsand thebrutal conditionsmen face on death row.Explore more on these topicsSouth CarolinaCapital punishmentUS crimeUS prisonsnewsShareReuse this content"

The incident appears to be theTrump administration’s first attempt to enter the city’s public schools since amending regulations to allow immigration agents to enter “sensitive areas” such as schools.At a Thursday press conference, theLos Angelesunified school district superintendent, Alberto Carvalho, confirmed that agents from the Department of Homeland Security were seeking five students in first through sixth grades.Officials attempted to enter two south Los Angeles schools, Lillian Street elementary and Russell elementary, but were turned away after the schools’ principals asked to see their identification. Los Angeles Unified is asanctuary districtand does not cooperate with federal immigration agencies.Ice can conduct enforcement actions in places of worship, US judge saysRead moreThe news comes as the Trump administration has escalatedits attacks against international studentsandramped up effortsto deport undocumented and documented immigrants alike. In January, homeland security rescinded Biden administration guidelines preventing its agents from entering “sensitive areas” including schools and churches.“Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest,” former acting homeland security secretary Benjamine Huffman said ina statementannouncing the new policy. “The Trump administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense.”In response, LA Unified began distributing “Know Your Rights” cards to students and the school police department issueda statementsaying it would not “assist or engage in immigration compliance checks, immigration enforcement activity, or ICE-related task force operations”.“I’m still mystified as to how a first-, second-, third-, fourth- or sixth-grader would pose any type of risk to the national security of our nation,” Carvalho said. “Schools are places for learning.Schoolsare places for understanding. Schools are places for instruction. Schools are not places of fear.”The superintendent told reporters that the immigration agents who arrived at the Los Angeles elementary schools said they wanted to see the “students to determine their well-being” as unaccompanied minors, and that they had received authorization to speak with students from their caretakers. He added that the district later spoke with the students’ caretakers and learned that was untrue.“DHS is leading efforts to conduct welfare checks on these children to ensure that they are safe and not being exploited, abused, and sex trafficked,” the homeland security department said in a statement toFox 11 Los Angeles.“Unlike the previous administration, President Trump and Secretary Noem take the responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to reunite children with their families. In less than 70 days, Secretary Noem and Secretary Kennedy have already reunited nearly 5,000 unaccompanied children with a relative or safe guardian.”US judge rules Mahmoud Khalil can be deported for his viewsRead moreCarvalho contested that, and said as an educator who entered the United States without authorization at the age of 17 himself, he felt “beyond my professional responsibility, a moral responsibility to protect these students”.The incident has drawn attention from congressional lawmakers, including Pasadena Democrat Judy Chu.“I’m absolutely incensed that DHS agents would try to enter elementary schools this week, and I’m so grateful to the brave LAUSD administrators who denied them entry. These are children who should be learning to read and write, not cowering in fear of being ripped away from their homes,” she said.“I’m concerned parents may keep their children home rather than risk sending them to school. As Angelenos, we must lock arms together in moments like these to protect kids from deportation squads and protect schools from Trump’s campaign of terror.”Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesUS immigrationUS educationTrump administrationUS politicsCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

The fact that Northwestern, a university supported by billions in federal funds, would dedicate its resources to support this illegal, antisemitic conduct raises serious questions.”The letter also alluded to “broader concerns about the institutionalization of leftwing political activism at Northwestern Law”, adding that the school’s Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic, led by the law professor Sheila Bedi, was using “Northwestern’s name and resources to engage in progressive-left political advocacy”.According to the letter, the House committee demanded that the university provide all written policies, procedures and guidance related to the function of the law school’s legal clinics, a detailed budget for the Bluhm Legal Clinic, and a list of its sources of funding. The committee also demanded the university turn over a list of all the Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic’s payments to people or groups not employed by Northwestern and any of its clinics and centers since 2020.In addition, the committee asked to review all hiring materials and performance reviews for Bedi.In response, Bedi and a fellow law professor, Lynn Cohn, sued the committee, asserting that its investigation violated their and their clients’ constitutional rights to free speech and due process, among others.The committee subsequently withdrew its request – a move that a Thursday press release from the Center for Constitutional Rights described as a “victory for academic freedom, the rule of law, and bedrock constitutional principles”.In a statement accompanying the press release, Bedi said: “I filed this suit to defend my clients’ rights to representation, my students’ rights to learn, and my right to teach. But today’s decision won’t stop the federal government’s attacks on universities and the legal profession.“Educators and institutions must stand united to protect our students, our communities, and each other … We teach, we advocate, and we stand with communities demanding justice. That’s why Congress is targeting us.”Echoing similar sentiments, Cohn said: “Uniting to support the fundamental rights of all people can still be done even in these turbulent times. We hope others will join this effort – this legal challenge is far from over. Clinical legal educators won’t back down. We will keep doing what we do best: centering students, defending our clients, and standing firm in defense of justice and the rule of law.”Donald Trump’s administration on Tuesdayfroze$790m for Northwestern University as part of the president’s increasing crackdowns on students and faculty members across US colleges who have expressed their opposition toward Israel’s deadly war on Gaza.In response to the federal crackdowns, more than 1,000 faculty members, alumni, students and attorneys have signed letters expressing their support for Northwestern University.One letter signed by hundreds of alumni in part said they were troubled “that the federal government would target legal scholars who have dedicated their careers to upholding constitutional liberties”, WWTWreports.Explore more on these topicsHouse of RepresentativesUS universitiesUS educationTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

US government bonds – typically seen as one of the world’s safest financial assets – continued to be sold off, and were on course for their biggest weekly loss since 2019. The dollar also fell against a basket of currencies, and was down against the euro and the pound.Leading stock indices paused for breath on Friday after days of torrid trading. The FTSE 100 rose 0.6% in London. The S&P 500 increased 1.8% and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.6% in New York.The S&P 500 finished an extraordinarily volatile week for markets up 5.7%, its biggest weekly gain since November 2023.“We are doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly. DJT”Some of Wall Street’s most influential figures were unconvinced. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Larry Fink, CEO of the investment giant BlackRock, told CNBC. Far from providing certainty, the 90-day pause on higher US tariffs on much of the world “means longer, more elevated uncertainty”, he added.Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the US’s largest bank, said the world’s largest economy was facing “considerable turbulence” as a key measure of consumer confidence tumbled to its lowest level since the Covid-19 pandemic – and the second-lowest level on record.US consumer sentiment has dropped 11% to 50.8 this month, ahead the pause announced by Trump earlier this week, according to a regularly survey compiled by the University of Michigan.Expectations for inflation meanwhile surged, with respondents indicating they are bracing for prices to rise by 6.7% over the coming year – the survey’s highest year-ahead inflation expectation reading since 1981.“There is great optimism in this economy,” Leavitt claimed at the White House briefing when asked about the survey. “Trust in President Trump. He knows what he’s doing. This is a proven economic formula.”Trump won back the White House last November by pledging to rapidly bring down prices – something he has claimed, in recent weeks, is already happening. US inflation climbed at an annual rate of 2.4% last month, according to official data.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added, however, that a bipartisan divide – with Democrats growing more pessimistic, while Republicans become more upbeat – suggests that people are allowing their political views to cloud their economic confidence.The US’s top markets watchdog is facing demands from senior Democrats to launch an investigation intoalleged insider trading and market manipulationafter Trump declared on social media that it was “A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!” hours before announcingWednesday’s climbdown on tariffs.Days of erratic policymaking constructed a rollercoaster week for markets, with the S&P 500 dropping 12% in just four sessions, before surging back almost 10% in a single day after the administration pulled back from imposing higher tariffs on most countries, exceptChina, which is facing a 145% tariff on exports to the US.In a letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),Senate Democratsincluding Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer wrote: “It is unconscionable that as American families are concerned about their financial security during this economic crisis entirely manufactured by the President, insiders may have actively profited from the market volatility and potentially perpetrated financial fraud on the American public.”‘The damage is done’: Trump’s tariffs put the dollar’s safe haven status in jeopardyRead moreTesla meanwhilestopped taking orders in Chinafor two models it previously imported from the US, as companies scramble to adapt to prohibitive tariffs imposed in Trump’s trade war.The manufacturer, run by Trump’s close allyElon Musk, removed “order now” buttons on its Chinese website for its Model S saloon and Model X sports utility vehicle.Tesla did not give any indication of why it had made the changes but it came after the rapid escalation of the trade war between the US and China.The border taxes make the goods trade between the two countries prohibitively expensive and mean cars imported from the US are now much less attractive inChinathan those produced locally.In the UK, economists warned that stronger than expected growth of 0.5% in February is likely to prove short lived as the impact of Trump’s trade war is felt throughout the global economy.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpChinaAsia PacificTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In some cases, firms appear to have dropped the word “diversity” from descriptions of their work. In at least one case, a change included revising a quote from firm partners to eliminate mention of diversity and inclusion.The Guardian contacted all of the firms mentioned in this story. None responded to a request for comment.The changes come as the president has waged a blunt and anti-democratic attack on DEI programs as well as the legal profession. He has sought to punish firms and lawyers who challenge him in court. He has used executive orders to punish five firms that have connections to political rivals, revoking their lawyers’ ability to access government buildings, security clearances, and making it extremely difficult for them to represent any client with business before the federal government.Fear spreads as Trump targets lawyers and non-profits in ‘authoritarian’ takedownRead moreTrump has specifically pointed to diversity programs at the firms he has targeted. Several firms have reached agreements with the president to avoid executive orders in which they have agreed not to use DEI in hiring.Many of the steps taken by law firms to capitulate to Trumpare being tracked in a speradsheetby the Coalition for Justice, an alliance of progressive student organizations at Georgetown law school in Washington DC. About a dozen students are keeping a spreadsheet of how hundreds of firms are responding.“The administration’s attacks are so blatantly illegal and unconstitutional that the law firms choosing to comply in advance is really a slap in the face for the legal profession,” said Mari Latibashvili, a second-year law student who is a leader of Coalition for Justice and has been helping with the tracker. “It’s them saying that they’re not willing to stand up for these very basic fundamental constitutional rights – the rule of law, legal ethics and just freedom of speech and expression – I think are just fundamental things that we all learn about first year of law school.”Lawyers at firms have contacted the students with tips, as have general counsels at various companies seeking to place business with firms that have taken a stand against the administration.More than 500 firms signed an amicus brief last week supporting achallengeby Perkins Coie to Trump’s executive order targeting the firm.In addition to the executive orders, the Trump administrationsent letterson 17 March to 20 firms asking about efforts to recruit non-white lawyers and suggesting that they may be discriminating against white people. Experts have raised alarm that the letters are unlawful and that the administration isgiving misleading informationabout the legality of DEI programs.One of the firms that received a letter was Latham & Watkins, which is regularly ranked among top firms in the US.In mid-February, legal recruiters at the firm sent an email to first-year law students across the country inviting them to attend a three-day networking event at the five-star Palace hotel in downtown San Francisco.The all-expenses paid event, the Diversity Leadership Academy, was designed to offer “insight into practicing at a global law firm and fosters community building with Latham lawyers and peers who share a commitment to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in the legal profession”, recruiters said in the email, which was obtained by the Guardian.a screengrab of a website“Participants join interactive seminars and discussions focused on Latham’s commitment to DEI, advancing DEI in the legal profession as a whole, and strategies for career success,” the firm’s website for the event said.But in late March, days before the event was set to take place, the firm sent a follow-up email, abruptly cancelling the event with no explanation. The firm instead would be offering “a series of online events”.Even though earlier messages had referred to DEI extensively, the cancellation message made no mention of diversity. The name of the event had been wholly changed – it was no longer called the Diversity Leadership Academy but instead the Student Pathways Academy.One first-year student from a top law school who had planned on attending the event noticed the changes and said it was clear the firm was capitulating to the Trump administration’s crackdown on diversity initiatives.“It’s very obvious that they don’t want to give an explanation,” said the student, who spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize job prospects. “The cowardice is kind of crazy … it really is just kind of stunning.”Latham & Watkins also has removed the diversity, equity & inclusion page from its website, according to a Guardian review of an archived version of the website. Thenow-deleted page on the sitesaid the firm “is uniquely positioned to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in our profession and in our communities. We value all of our colleagues and their perspectives, we fight for social justice, and we educate ourselves to be better allies for each other.”In its stead is a new page, titled “belong as you are”. It says: “We value colleagues of varied backgrounds, life experiences, and circumstances”. “Our programs are open to all without regard to race, gender, or any other protected characteristics. We seek to bring fresh perspectives from people with varying life experiences to our firm and create an environment in which all can succeed.”Other firms, including Kirkland & Ellis, Sidley Austin, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, have all removed or edited their diversity pages. All three wereamong the 20 firms that received a letterfrom the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in March asking about their diversity programs.But firms not directly targeted by the Trump administration also appear to have made changes.As recentlyas February, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman’s website included a quote from a firm partnerthat said“Pillsbury is committed to structural, sustainable diversity and inclusion. We assess ourselves honestly, and relentlessly push to be better.”That quote has now been replaced with another from the same partner that says “Pillsbury invests in its people, expects consummate professionalism, and drives excellent performance. These three “P’s”, together, deliver unparalleled client service.”Greenberg Traurig, another firm, had the words “culture” “commitment” and “diversity” displayed prominently on the firm’s landing page as recently as January. It has since removed the word “diversity” and replaced it with “engagement”. It also revamped a page on the site focused on diversity to be focused on “Engagement, Culture & Opportunity.”a screengrab of a websiteSeveral firms also appear to have quietly revised their descriptions of pro-bono work to eliminate things that don’t align with the Trump administration’s priorities.The firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, for example, removed “political asylum seekers,” and “victims of racial gender discrimination”from a description of pro-bono clients it has represented. The firm also removed a list of non-profits it has partnered with on pro-bono matters.a screengrab of a websiteKirkland & Ellis, one of the country’s largest and most profitable firms, removed mention of its relationship to “social justice organizations” from a quote from firm chair Leslie Smith on the pro-bono section of its website. The firm also appears to have edited out mention of its work on behalf of death penalty clients from a list of pro-bono work.a screengrab of a websiteTrump signs order targeting law firm behind $787.5m Fox defamation suitRead moreDavis Polk, another major firm, removed mention of immigration and racial justice from a quote on its website from a top lawyer in the pro-bono practice. As recently as February, the lawyers in its pro-bono practice were listed with titles that conveyed which areas they worked on, including racial justice and humanitarian immigration. Those titles have since been removed and all of the firm’s pro-bono lawyers now are listed with the same title: counsel.Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, whichagreed to offer $100min pro-bono work to the Trump administration, has removed much of its past pro-bono work from its website.Latibashvili, the Georgetown law student keeping track of the changes, said the removals from the website were not just cosmetic.“Having information about diversity, equity and inclusion is about what kinds of values you espouse, the people that you hire, the kind of environment that you create in your work, how you talk about legal issues and the cases that you take on,” she said. “If it’s not a big deal, then why are you taking it down?”Do you have a tip?

But neither factor appears to have been what motivated the president’s sudden volte-face this week, when hepaused most of his “liberation day” border taxes for 90 days.The fact Trump could not ignore was amass sell-off by investors of US government bonds. But what exactly are bonds, how are they traded – and why are they so central to the current crisis?What is a bond?A bond is a certificate confirming that its owner has lent money to a specified borrower that will be repaid at a fixed date, typically with a fixed rate of interest. Known as fixed-income securities, they appeal to investors who want stable returns.Corporations issue bonds to borrow money and so do governments – to pay for investments and other expenditure. The UK government’s bonds are called gilts, while US government bonds are known as treasuries, traditionally seen as a safe haven because they are guaranteed by the world’s biggest economy. They are issued with different maturity dates when they must be paid off in full, with two-year, 10-year and 30-year bonds being common.How are they traded?Bonds can be bought and sold like shares on a secondary market – an exchange – but, unlike shares, they offer guaranteed annual returns. The bond market is the world’s biggest securities exchange, worth almost $130tn (£99tn), with the US market accounting for about 40% of debt worldwide.Government bonds are usually sold to financial institutions in auctions, and can then be resold on the secondary market for more or less than their face value.What is a bond yield?Bond yields represent the amount of money an investor receives for owning the debt as a percentage of its current price. When the price of a bond falls, yields rise. The yield is commonly referred to as an interest rate, or the cost of borrowing to an issuer.Rising yields suggest dwindling appetite to own the debt among investors, which can be influenced by a range of factors including an issuer’s ability to repay. For governments, this centres on the prospects for the country’s economy and finances.Inflation expectationsalso have a significant impact. This is because inflation undercuts the future value of money received for owning the debt. This means investors could demand a higher yield to compensate for the risk.And because other financial products, such as mortgages, are priced off the yield, there is a spillover into the broader economy.What have Trump’s tariffs done to bonds?At first the US president considered his tariff plan to be working, having anticipated stock markets would react badly to tariffs and the dollar would fall.Trump was sure the bond market would remain calm because he promised to pay for tax cuts later in the year with revenues from tariffs, meaning the US government could limit the number of bonds it issues, keeping supply and demand in sync and putting a cap on overall government debt levels.However, the tariff war has prompted fears of a US recession, making it riskier to lend to the US. There are concerns that the US will become locked in a titanic struggle with China, which would damage both economies over a long period and drag down global growth.In response, investors have sold US bonds in huge quantities, driving down their value and sending the yield higher, making future government debt more expensive to issue.Where did this leave Trump?There was a fear in the White House that paying a higher interest rate on national debt would increase the government’s annual spending deficit, adding pressure to an already stretched budget and increasing the overall debt mountain.Worse, the $29tn market in US treasuries is the bedrock of the global financial system and heavy selling could put pressure on other parts of it, forcing banks or other institutions to default and causing a wider financial crisis.Has the situation eased?After the US president said he would suspend punitive tariffs on all countries other than China for 90 days, bonds markets began to settle. However, yields remain high, with the effective interest rate on a 10-year Treasury bond at 4.52% on Friday compared with 3.99% on 4 April.Is this Trump’s Liz Truss moment?The UK’s 49-day prime minister was brought down by her own skirmish with the bond markets, whichconsidered her mini-budget to be reckless. That verdict sent the yield on UK gilts rocketing as bond values dropped like a stone, which forced mortgage companies to increase borrowing rates and wrecked Truss’s premiership.While Trump has more resources, he faces similar concerns about the spillover effects. If his policies do drive up inflation as expected, with some analysts forecasting a rate of 4.5% by next year, that could alienate the Republican core vote that brought him in on promises to cut soaring food prices. Voters could see tariffs as a tax on mortgages if banks start to charge more for home loans on the back of higher yields, denting his popularity with his base.Explore more on these topicsBondsGiltsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsTrump administrationexplainersShareReuse this content"

Rory McIlroy had opted to keep his thoughts to himself after thewounding end to his first roundat the 89th Masters. An inspired follow up by the Northern Irishman made it easy to assume he had taken things personally. Did you think the two double bogeys in four closing holes ended his latest attempt at claiming the career grand slam? Think again. Courtesy of spellbinding, stunning golf, McIlroy blasted his way through the Georgia pines and back into contention.Statistical gurus had insisted glory was already beyond him. Craig Stadler was the last man to triumph here with more than one double bogey on his card. That happened in 1982. What the numerati failed to acknowledge was that McIlroy had 54 holes to recover. With 36 remaining, he sits two from Justin Rose. Buckle up.McIlroy’s front nine of 35 was solid and unspectacular. He reached the turn and hit the accelerator. The 35-year-old also demonstrated why he remains golf’s most entertaining player. Rory-land is seldom dull. “It is only halfway,” McIlroy said. “Anything can happen.” He knows that better than anybody in this field.Rory McIlroy back in the mix after prayers answered around Amen CornerRead moreA magnificent approach to the 10th left a tap in birdie. He had only a little more to do at the 11th. On the 12th, McIlroy encountered the kind of good fortune that suggested someone, somewhere might finally be looking favourably upon his Masters quest. His tee shot flew towards foliage after a wicked greenside bounce. Seconds later, the ball emerged close to the putting surface. He retrieved a par three. His second to the par-five 13th was jaw-dropping, from pine straw and 214 yards to within 10ft of the cup. Eagle landed. At the next, he looked in serious difficulty amid trees. He launched an outrageous iron to inside 20ft. “I rode my luck on 13 and 14,” McIlroy said. “I feel like those are the sorts of things that need to happen in major championships.” This felt needlessly self-deprecating.The 15th, where McIlroy had come unstuck a day earlier, delivered a birdie. At the 17th, another Thursday nemesis, he was unfortunate not to collect another shot. A routine par at the last and a day’s work added up to 66. This matches his career-best second round at Augusta. That pair of Thursday scorecard blemishes aside, McIlroy has not dropped a shot. For 34 out of 36 holes, he has looked in complete command.Corey Conners later joined McIlroy on six under. Scottie Scheffler hovers, obviously, as does Tyrrell Hatton. Scheffler received a piece of outrageous luck at the 12th before chipping in for a birdie two. He would be the most infuriating of opponents. Both Scheffler and Hatton closed on five under after messy finishes.Rose reached eight under par in battling fashion, courtesy of a 71. The Englishman had to scrap and scrape for much of his morning. Understandably, he branded this a “decent day”.View image in fullscreenJustin Rose splashes out of the bunker on the 17th hole on his way to a 71.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersThe high points involved birdies at the par threes, the 12th and the 16th, after glorious tee shots. Rose did, however, hand sloppy shots back to the course at the 14th and 17th. A dozen years have flown by since he won his only major, at Merion’s US Open. He smiled when asked whether Masters victory would mean more to him now, at the age of 44.“I’ll take it anytime, beggars can’t be choosers,” Rose said. “I would take it right now for sure. Sometimes if it happens too early in your career, you’ve got a lot to live up to. I think if it happens now, I would enjoy it, I think, probably a lot more. You know, come a bit more as a gift towards the end of your career. So I think there would be a lot more satisfaction in it for sure.”Bryson DeChambeau is threatening to have the last laugh at those who derided him for once declaring Augusta National played as a par 67. A sixth-placed finish here last year preceded victory at the US Open. Now, DeChambeau has eyes fixed on holding half of golf’s majors at one time. A 68 (one over?) means he is just one adrift of Rose. The American punched the air at the last having holed out from 8ft for par. It is easy to fixate on his occasionally wild theories and obsession with content creation; the fact is he has developed hugely as a competitive force. DeChambeau will do things his way and his way has an increasing tendency to work. “I’m learning,” he said. “I have a little more wisdom than the last year and hopefully the year before. So, continuing to grow.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lowry revealed he had breakfast with McIlroy before the pair took to the course. “We talked about what he did yesterday and he was quite frustrated,” Lowry said. “I’m sure last night was tough for him. We both played our way into the tournament nicely.”Matt McCarty is the surprise package on the same score, having won only once on thePGA Tour. Rasmus Højgaard and Viktor Hovland maintain a strong European theme on the leaderboard, the pair sitting at four under par. Ludvig Åberg made bogey at the last two, his 73 nudging him back to three under. The former champion Hideki Matsuyama has the same total.Ángel Cabrera’s return following – among other things – a jail term lasted 36 holes. That equates to six more than the number of months he spent in prison. The Argentinian comfortably missed the cut at 11 over par. Brooks Koepka – remember him? – and Adam Scott were among those to suffer the same fate.Explore more on these topicsThe MastersEuropean TourGolfPGA TourUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Things fall apart. But sometime they also don’t. And the centre does actually hold.Perhaps the most interesting part ofMohamed Salah’s contract extensionat Liverpool is the fact this is a rare crossover story, a signing that steps outside its own tribal margins. There will of course be localised delight. Liverpool fans can look forward to their own lost weekend in the sun, a sense that the good times will now continue to roll, that the time bar has shifted. Return to your seats. This is a lock-in.Salah signs new Liverpool deal and is challenged by Slot to ‘reach perfection’Read moreMore widely, Salah staying is a shot of adrenaline for the Premier League, which is sold on fat, wet personality driven storylines, a star factory that does sometimes have to scrape the walls for actual stars. The commercial logic is obvious. Salah is the league’s best player. Salah is the most famous African footballer. Salah is the biggest sporting star in the Muslim world.Salah is also a one-man blue-chip brand, instantly recognisable, the beaming, scurrying cartoon squirrel of elite football, his cut-through benevolent and broad. Never mind Liverpool’s global fanbase. Richard Masters will have been doing the running man in his underpants on Friday morning. This is like Disney re-signing Mickey Mouse.Given the widely trailed nature of the deal it will be necessary now to have takes about the takes, to identify wider points of jeopardy. With this in mind it perhaps won’t be long before some contrarian suggests that if Liverpool’s owners really are the hedge fund sharks of the popular imagination, all vampire teeth, faces thin and glossed as the corporate credit card, they will put Salah up for sale.Seriously. Sell him to Paris Saint-Germain for £90m this summer. This would be the economically rational decision. Instant gain for the cost of a little ink and some printed sheets. Corporate policy retained. Duty to shareholders observed. Nothing personal kids. It’s always, always business.This would also be entirely wrong, of course, and for reasons that go beyond armed insurrection in L4. The fact is Liverpool’s executive had no choice. Losing Salah for nothing would have been sackable corporate incompetence. Here is your data outlier, a player with 32 goals and 22 assists this season. Here is your chief branding item, the most followed Premier League player on social media by an absolute mile, a one-man bonus streaming rights deal.Plus there is a kind of institutional debt here. Salah’s presence over the past eight seasons has defined not just an era of success, the lifting of an emotional cloud, but the owners’ wondrous returns on their financial investment. There is an argument it would make commercial and cultural sense for FSG to pay Salah just to sit in the stands for the next two years, put him on gardening leave, pay him to wave on posters.So yes, there is no downside on the face of it. Except, this is football, and there must always be variables, lurking doom, potential collapse, all of which are key to the game’s strangely inelastic appeal. The fact is, this is not entirely a free ride. It comes with challenges, not least for Arne Slot.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah has provided relentless value for money for Liverpool.Photograph: Nikki Dyer/LFC/Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesSigning Salah doesn’t change one key point. With or without him, next season still has to be the start of a rebuild. There was a tendency during the first half of the season, as Slot’s team played with a kind of light around them, to dismiss Jürgen Klopp as a kind of woad-smeared energy guy, to see Slot sifting successfully through the parts, finally bringing order to this first draft of history.By now it seems clear the current title-bound season is also a hybrid triumph. Slot has overseen the first fix with remarkable skill. But he will now have to effect a more profound building job. For the first time there will be a slight sense of pressure around Salah too.The football has very clearly not left him, is still clinging to his collar, giddy on the ride. Salah isn’t even very old. It might seem as though he has been around for ever, 10 years since he was skittering down the Chelsea right, peak malevolent José Mourinho up there taking bites on his touchline, but Salah is 32, not 35.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Salah’s form – we can talk about this now – has been poor. In seven games since the Etihad he has had three shots on target. He has scored one league goal from open play at Anfield since Boxing Day. He has basically been a shadow since the home leg against PSG.Slot knows Salah-dependence in attack has been the story of the season up to a point, which is fine as long as it worksThe Roy Keane theory of Big-Men-For-Big-Stuff would see this as shrinking in the face of destiny. But it would also be wrong to suggest Liverpool have dipped because Salah has dipped, rather than the other way round or, as ever, a bit of both. Teams are more complex than this. Slot has always seemed more interested in Salah’s defensive work, which has been good this season, and speaks more clearly to his ability to fit an evolving shape.But Slot also knows Salah-dependence in attack has been the story of the season up to a point, which is fine as long as it works. This has to change, and with a little less in the way of revolution now.Slot also knows he owes Salah. The manager has been rightly praised for his tinkering, his command of small details. But it is clearly a bonus on this front when you also happen to have a ruthless goal maniac up front justifying every choice by kicking the ball into the net. The more I walk around the place with my finger on the trigger of this AK-47 the more people keep calling me a genius and laughing at all my jokes.From here Slot still needs not only a post-Salah plan but a current one too. Salah’s departure would have been a disaster. But it would at least have offered something closer to scorched earth, a refresh from ground zero. No doubt some will point out PSG got shot of Kylian Mbappé two years too late. Salah barely registers on the Mbappé Scale of mega-divas, but he does have an ego, does say stuff in the mixed zone when it suits him, does look cross when he gets subbed off. This will require managing.Salah is also the one player in the league who has basically just given for the last eight seasons, offering up only relentless value for money. He deserves this two-year run into whatever version of the future Slot can build around him. All logic suggests that job just got a little easier. But it will come with challenges too. Caveat re-emptor. The rebuild still starts here.Explore more on these topicsMohamed SalahLiverpoolcommentShareReuse this content"

Everything points to a chance for McLaren to dominate at the Sakhir circuit but there may also be some indication if Red Bull are making real steps forward with their car.ForMcLaren, Bahrain is a chance to throw off their hoodoo at the track where they have never won and at which, in recent years, they have struggled for form. This season in testing at the circuit they gave their first evidence that they had a much-improved package; one swiftly reinforced with dominant victories for Lando Norris in Australia and then his teammate, Oscar Piastri, in China.Robert Reid, deputy president for sport, becomes latest FIA executive to resignRead moreLast week in Japan a combination of exceptionally low tyre degradation on a newly resurfaced circuit and it being all but impossible to overtake, meant track position was crucial and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen converted a stunning pole to a superb win.The circumstances at Suzuka were very much an outlier however; in Bahrain if the McLaren is as strong as has been anticipated they can expect to show it. In hot conditions on a high degradation track its advantage in being very easy on the tyres, allied to a fearsome pace, could lead to a whitewash. If it does it would be an ominous signal of the gap the rest must bridge.McLaren, as has often been the case this year, are playing down their chances and there is the caveat that their car can be difficult to wrangle over a single lap on low fuel, making it trickier to qualify, but in race pace Piastri conceded the MCL39 was as good a ride as he has ever had.“This has not been a great track for us in the past couple of years, well even longer than that, to be honest,” he said. “So it will be a good test for us. But we’re as confident as we have been in my time at the team. We are in a position to win this weekend.”For the understated Australian, those words are the verbal equivalent of ripping off his shirt, beating his chest and declaring the opposition might like to eat his shorts.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri, signing a cap for a fan, is in a confident mood before the Bahrain Grand Prix.Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Formula 1/Getty ImagesVerstappen remained optimistic that the steps his team were taking were bringing their car back into contention, having remarkably managed to stay just one point behind the championship leader, Lando Norris, with Piastri 13 points back in third. However, the numbers the Dutchman may be more interested in are how close he can stay to the McLarens in the desert. Pulling another win out of the bag on Sunday would be extraordinary.McLaren’s major test in Bahrain then may be how best to manage their approach and the two drivers, both of whom are hungrily eyeing the title. Norris was critical of the team’s strategy in Japan, where he was second, unable to pass Verstappen on track after a conservative pit stop strategy. “Could it have been better and could we have potentially taken more risks and been a bit more attacking as a team? Yes,” he said, “I am here to win races and not settle for second, so definitely I would love to kind of go back and redo things with a slightly more aggressive approach.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With 21 races to go clocking up every possible point may be crucial. But their decision not to switch drivers in Japan to allow Piastri a shot at Verstappen was questioned as demonstrating a lack of will to hurl their all into the attack.Equally, the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, has noted that McLaren have made their position harder by insisting on allowing both drivers to race freely. They will take points off one another and Verstappen will keep chipping away to stay on their tails.The McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, reiterated in Bahrain his belief that having two top performing drivers was a benefit rather than a hindrance, with each pushing the other on to greater heights. Certainly in practice in Bahrain the McLaren looked absolutely formidable. Norris was on top in the first runs, two-tenths clear of Alpine’s Pierre Gasly. While in the second session Piastri had the edge, a tenth up on his teammate but a full half a second ahead of Mercedes’ George Russell in third, with Verstappen, eight-tenths down in seventh.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportMcLarenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now it’s time to prove itThe Philadelphia boxer nicknamed Boots, touted as a future pound-for-pound No 1, carries sky-high expectations and an unfinished family legacy into the biggest fight of his lifeBryan Armen GrahamFri 11 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 10.19 EDTShareBozy’s Dungeon never had a fixed address. For years it was tucked two blocks from the clattering El train in NorthPhiladelphia, past strips of weathered rowhouses and corner stores. These days it sits in a quiet residential stretch of the Great Northeast. The location and sign on the door might change, but inside, it’s always the same: a temple of toughness and repetition, where talk is cheap and fighters are made brick by brick, round after round. The ring is sacred, the rules unwritten but understood: work, wait, and one day, your shot will come. For Jaron Ennis, the amply gifted welterweight from Philly known as Boots, that day arrives Saturday night.Ennis, the InternationalBoxingFederation’s champion at 147lb, unbeaten over 33 professional fights with 29 wins inside the distance, will put it all on the line under the vaulted ceilings of Atlantic City’s Boardwalk Hall against Eimantas Stanionis, a rugged, come-forward brawler from Lithuania who holds the World Boxing Association’s version of the title. For Ennis, it’s more than a unification bout. It’s a prime opportunity to shed the perception that, despite his immaculate record and world champion status, he remains a fighter on the cusp rather than one firmly established at the top.“The future of boxing,” as Eddie Hearn likes to call him. Ennis’ silver-tongued promoter is not alone. Indeed, when arecent Ring Magazine featurepredicted boxing’s pound-for-pound hierarchy in five years’ time, Boots was an uncontroversial pick for No 1. That long-held promise, however, demands a present-tense breakthrough.Since turning pro in 2016, Ennis has delivered a series of highlight-reel victories, racking up knockouts and breathless hype among the sport’s chattering class. The 27-year-old blends elite athleticism, switch-hitting creativity and knockout power with a high ring IQ and rare adaptability, making him one of boxing’s most complete operators. He is long, lean and hard to touch: 5ft 10in with a 74in reach that creates problems before the first punch is thrown. But recent performances – particularly a decision win over Karen Chukhadzhian in a November rematch that lacked urgency – have been met with muted praise. The hesitation from fans and critics alike isn’t about his talent, which is plainly brilliant and beyond dispute. It’s about whether he’s fully tapped into it.Ennis has heard the doubts. “If I pitch a shutout, ‘oh, you should’ve knocked him out.’ If I knock someone out, ‘oh, we don’t know if he has a gas tank,’” he said this week. “I’m at the point now where I don’t care what people say. I do what’s best for me.”View image in fullscreenJaron Ennis and Eimantas Stanionis face off at Thursday’s final press conference in Atlantic City ahead of their welterweight title unification fight on Saturday night at Boardwalk Hall.Photograph: Mark Robinson/Getty ImagesThat mandatory rematch, he admits, forced a shift in approach. “We were forced into fighting him to keep the IBF belt,” Ennis said. “I’m glad I had that fight. It made me a lot smarter in this camp.”His father and trainer, Derek ‘Bozy’ Ennis Sr, saw it too. “I think he got into the habit of knocking everyone out. I want to get away from that. Maybe he’s forgotten what got him there: his jab, boxing and moving.”Those fundamentals are what the Dungeon is built on. Currently located inside the Philly’s Next Champ facility in the city’s Bustleton section, the gym prizes foundation over flash and with good reason. Jaron is the third Ennis son to step into the ring – and the one burdened with finishing a mission that began decades ago. Before him came Derek ‘Pooh’ Ennis, a slick, smart junior middleweight who won the regional USBA title and beat future contenderslike Gabriel Rosado. And Farah Ennis, a bigger, stronger super middleweight who started 17-0, claimed the stepping-stone NABF belt with a stoppage of Victor Lares in 2010 and looked poised to break through. But both brothers fell just short of the sport’s highest tiers.Now that inflection point has arrived for Boots, who enters the biggest fight of his career on Saturday night as the consensus No 1 welterweight in the world. With longtime champions Terence Crawford and Errol Spence having abandoned the division sincetheir four-belt unification blockbusterin 2023, the throne is vacant even if the belts are occupied. Stanionis, ranked No 2, stands in his way – and the 30-year-old may be the kind of opponent who finally brings out the best in Boots.“This is the moment the family has been waiting for,” said Pooh Ennis at Thursday’s final press conference at the Caesars Atlantic City casino hotel. “This is the fight that puts [Boots] in a different class.”Stanionis (15-0, 9 KOs) is a former Olympian who fights with volume, grit and an unrelenting motor. After sitting out 2023 due to repeated postponements of a bout with Vergil Ortiz Jr, he returned last April with a competitive but clear points win over Gabriel Maestre. His résumé isn’t long, but it’s sturdy. He carries himself like a man who’s been waiting years for this shot.View image in fullscreenJaron Ennis, right, lands a punch on Karen Chukhadzhian during the 11th round of their IBF welterweight title fight last November in Philadelphia.Photograph: Chris Szagola/APHe’s also entering the ring with more than a title on the line. “My baby might come today or tomorrow,” he said Thursday, noting that his wife is due any moment. “I left everything behind because I believe in myself. This was my most brutal camp. I sacrificed everything because I believe I can win. I’m all gas, no brakes.”“Then you’re gonna run into a rock,” Ennis replied with a wry grin.Their clash promises action. Stanionis comes forward and consistently presses the issue. Ennis thrives on angles, reflexes and sharp counters. If Boots is locked in, Stanionis’ aggression may backfire. If not, the Lithuanian has enough grit to test the limits of Ennis’ poise and defense.Bozy Ennis, the increasingly in-demand trainer who has coached Jaron since childhood and molded dozens of top fighters in Philadelphia, sees this as a pivotal fork in the road. “Stanionis is one of the best in the division,” he said Thursday. “It’s a good fight and it’s a tough fight.”The fight marks Ennis’s third under the Matchroom banner, a partnership he embraced after Showtime Sports folded in late 2023 and promotional uncertainty left his career in limbo. Now beneath the bright lights of the Atlantic City boardwalk, he sees the opportunity to not just win but make a statement. “I’m ready to show out and put on a show and show the world why I’m the best,” Boots said. “Come Saturday night I’m going to take home all these belts.”Critics of Ennis have argued he hasn’t yet faced an opponent who can truly push him, putting his prodigious talents to a proper road test. That changes on Saturday. And with the historic Boardwalk Hall as the backdrop – a 96-year-old venue that has hosted the likes of Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis, Bernard Hopkins and Arturo Gatti – the timing feels right for a breakout performance. “One of my favorite fights wasFloyd v Gatti, and that was in this arena,” Ennis said. “Now it’s my turn.”View image in fullscreenJaron Ennis, above, one of Philadelphia’s two active world champions along with featherweight Stephen Fulton, throws out the first pitch before a Dodgers-Phillies game at Citizens Bank Park last week.Photograph: Icon Sportswire/Getty ImagesBut this moment isn’t just about Boots. It’s the culmination of a family’s decades-long pursuit. Bozy’s own pro career ended with a modest record of four wins and two losses as a middleweight, but his reputation as a trainer, andphysical marvelbelying his 69 years, has grown with Boots’ rise. His sons have filled Philly gyms and local fight cards for more than 15 years. But world title glory – the kind that sticks – has eluded them. Until now. “The connection between father and son is different,” said Bozy. “We believe in what we’re building. And we’re not in a rush. We stay ready.”After Saturday, there may be no more waiting. A win puts Ennis at 34-0. It sets up unification bouts with WBC champion Mario Barrios or WBO titleholder Brian Norman Jr. And it places Boots firmly in the conversation among the sport’s elite. He’s made no secret of his long-term goals – he wants every title at 147lb before moving up to 154 – but insists he’s tuned out all talk of future opponents to focus on the task at hand. “I’m here to collect all the belts, and I’m locked in on Stanionis,” Ennis said. “Win on Saturday and I’m the WBA, IBF and Ring Magazine champion, and then we’ll see what’s next. But I am zoned in on Stanionis, no doubt, and I’m ready to give everybody what they are asking for.”So zoned in, in fact, that he spent most of Thursday’s presser quietly playing Sudoku on his phone. But boxing, more than most sports, doesn’t reward potential. It rewards performance under fire. Stanionis will apply the pressure. Whether Ennis can cope will say everything about the ceiling he’s long been told he has – and the floors his family built for him to stand on. “I’m not looking for the knockout,” Ennis said. “But it’s going to come.”Bozy believes the same and more. “Boots hasn’t even hit another level yet,” he said. “Maybe Stanionis brings it out. That’s what I’m waiting for. Because then the world’s going to see something.”And if that something is a coronation, it won’t just belong to Jaron. It will belong to Germantown. To the Dungeon. To Pooh and Farah. To the Ennis family, who dreamed it first. On Saturday night in Atlantic City, Boots fights for all of them.Explore more on these topicsBoxingUS sportsPhiladelphiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the attributes that make him stand out could also be his downfallAndrew LawrenceFri 11 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 05.01 EDTShareDesmond Watson is pro football’s nextverybig thing: a 6ft 6in, 464lb defensive tackle who is poised to become the heaviest player ever selected at theNFLdraft, which takes place later this month. “He’s a unicorn,” his coach at Florida, Billy Napier, said last month. “You’ll go the rest of your career, and you’ll never be around a guy that’s that stature.A native of Plant City, Florida, the state’s strawberry capital, Watson was the Gators’ big man on campus, a larger-than-life folk hero to match the school’s7ft 9in basketball prospect. When Watson arrived at college, he already weighed 440lb – or about as much as a standup piano. Watson’s legend grew once he cracked the team’s starting lineup the following year. During a 2022 game against South Carolina, Watson left 89,000 fans gasping after hesplit a double team and ripped the ball awayfrom his opponent in a hit reminiscent of Jadeveon Clowney’s helmet-popping hit against Michiganin the 2013 Outback Bowl. (It’s a wonder Spencer Rattler, the Gamecocks’ 6ft 1in, 218lb quarterback, managed to tackle Watson to the ground afterwards.) At last year’s Gasperilla Bowl, Watson’s college swan song, the Gators handed the ball off to him to get a first down late in the game. “I can do it all,” he said afterward.At Florida’s pro day, Watson showed NFL scouts the full range of that versatility and the extent to which it bends the rules of physics. Besides out-benchpressing every other draft prospect, Watson logged a 25in vertical and a 5.93-second time in the 40-yard dash – poor scores for most NFL hopefuls but impressive for someone of his size. The performance won Watson fans across the country and had analysts buzzing about his pro prospects like never before. The former Cincinnati Bengals receiver Chad ‘Ochocinco’ Johnson told Watson he’d “look good in stripes” – but any team that’s appraising the Gators bulldozer will also have to think about his literal locker room fit. At Florida, he wore a size-6XL jersey along with custom-made pads and cleats. The only small thing on Watson was his number, 21 – digits that are usually reserved for skill position players. (He picked it to honor his younger brother, Dyson, who wore the number before suffering a life-altering stroke.)The Cowboys have a brilliant scouting network. They also have Jerry JonesRead moreBut the thing that really has Watson’s admirers excited is his potential to be just the immovable object to stand up to the NFL’s unstoppable force – the tush push. After a season that saw the Philadelphia Eagles call the “brotherly shove” time and again as they won the Super Bowl,the league is considering banning the play– a quarterback sneak with a teammate or two providing a boost. Tush push detractors believe the play gives too much of an advantage to teams with jumbo-sized offensive linemen. But until the play is officially banned it may be that teams need to stock up on bigger defensive linemen as a counter.That’s what makes Watson so intriguing: he could be one of those prospects who affects the players who come after him. In the 1980s, 330lb rookie William ‘Refrigerator’ Perry was the one dazzling crowds with his strength and speed on both defense and offense during the Chicago Bears’ Super Bowl XX run. In the 1990s, Nate Newton (nicknamed the Kitchen because he was 5lb heavier than Perry) went from USFL castoff to the linchpin offensive lineman of Dallas Cowboys’ championship dynasty. In the noughties, Cleveland Browns offensive tackle Orlando Brown was such a sight to behold at 6ft 7in and 360lb that people called him Zeus.But linemen Brown’s size are fixtures in the game now – with do-it-all big men like the Detroit Lions’ Penei Sewellsetting the standard. Watson has a chance to break the NFL mold again with his even bigger frame. Just the sight of him clashing with average-sized (for football) players had onlookers gushing about how he makes Perry, the Bears legend, look like “a mini fridge”. The idea that he could usher in a new era of 400lb pound linemen is intriguing. “People see that number and think My 600-pound Life,” Watson’s high school coach, Evan Davis, told the Gainesville Sun in 2021.But is playing a punishing game at Watson’s weight even sustainable? Football already exacts a brutal physical toll on players. Bigger bodies mean bigger collisions, more strain on joints and an increased risk for injury. To Watson’s immense credit, he never missed a game in his college career – but he has also struggled to maintain his weight, and the Florida pro day marked his heaviest weigh-in yet. Fans who watched Watson’s workout were quick to point out Watson huffing and puffing through portions of some agility drills – worrying signs, perhaps, of a lack of stamina. Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe reckons Watson could be a reliable playmaker at 420lb – but Watson was reluctant to put any limits on himself. “I played against Tennessee, which was the fastest offense in the nation, all four years [of college],” he told Sharpe. “So [weight] isn’t really a worry of mine. But I know the lighter I get, the more I can dominate because that’s the goal.” He added that he is working with a nutritionist to address his diet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it was only a matter of time before he filled out. That’s perhaps no surprise: his father is 6ft 4in and 300lb. His mother, a former basketball standout, is 250lb – weight she chalks up to having six kids and a lack of activity during Covid lockdowns. That said, not everyone in his family is big. “I come from a family of receivers and running backs, track athletes,” Watson said. “I think it was just destined for me to play in the interior. My older brother is 5ft 9in, 165lb.” Watson is referring to Darrian McNeal, a formerUniversity of Oregon slot receiver.At the moment, he projects as a late-round selection or a priority free-agent signee – but it wouldn’t come as a surprise to seeEagles GM Howie Roseman, who built the sport’stallest and heaviest offensive line, snap up Watson to preserve the team’s tush-push monopoly. One could also envision Watson being selected with the very last pick in the draft and becoming the NFL’s largest everMr Irrelevant. But historic size doesn’t guarantee a long NFL career. Aaron Gibson, who was 410lb when the Lions made him the heaviest player ever drafted, in 1999, played five seasons and missed time every year but one because of nagging injuries.Watson should get an opportunity to prove himself. Whether it’s a right-sized opportunity will be up to him. “I don’t care who it is,” Watson said of the teams that might draft him. “If anybody’s trying to put me in a jersey, I’m ready for it.” In a 6XL or slimmer fare, the reward could wind up dwarfing the risk.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The data says ... not exactlyRead more“That’s my celebration now until somebody else has a problem with it, and I’ll find another one,” Morant said after Thursday’s shootaround.The league handed down the $75,000 fine on 4 April after Morant twice made what was considered an “inappropriate” imaginary gun-aiming gesture on the court. He was previously warned by the league office that this gesture could be interpreted in a negative light.The gestures that drew the fine were made by Morant during the Grizzlies’ 110-108 victory over the Miami Heat on 3 April, but it first drew the league’s attention in a 1 April home game against the Golden State Warriors.That led to the investigation and the warning before Morant did it again against Miami.The fine was the culmination of several questionable incidents involving firearms. Morant was suspended for 25 games at the start of the 2023-24 season after he was seen on video waving a gun in a car. He previously was suspended eight games after he was seen with a gun in a Denver-area nightspot.“I wasn’t surprised,” Morant said of the latest fine, “just for showing people what’s pretty much been evident for the last two years.”Teammate Vince Williams Jr wasn’t really surprised by the change in celebration, adding “I would have went to that too.”“It’s good for him,” Williams said. “He gets to save his money. Anything that benefits him saving his money, I’m all for it, honestly.”But the grenade celebration drew criticism from the TNT studio crew on Thursday night. Kenny Smith noted that Morant “has a history that maybe he shouldn’t be doing that.”Shaquille O’Neal added: “He knows what he’s doing because y’all are going to keep talking about it.”As for Charles Barkley, he said the happiest person may be former Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins, fired 28 March because “he ain’t got to deal with this immature stuff”.Explore more on these topicsMemphis GrizzliesNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Pickett started one game last season for the Eagles while backing up Jalen Hurts. He was 14-10 as a starter in two years with the Steelers.The well-traveled Flacco has bounced around since his prime in Baltimore in the 2010s, a stretch in which he led the Ravens to a Super Bowl. He spent a year in Denver, three with the New York Jets, one in Cleveland and one in Indianapolis.Now it’s back to the Browns, who made the somewhat curious decision not to re-sign him after he went 4-1 as a starter in 2023 and averaged more than 300 yards passing per game. They decided to stick with the problematic Watson instead, a decision that has backfired repeatedly since they sent a bevy of first-round picks to Houston for him and then signed him to a massive deal that looks like one of the worst in NFL history.Cleveland owner Jimmy Haslam admitted recently that the team took a big swing for Watson and missed badly.“We’ve got to dig ourselves out of that hole,” Haslam said in March.The Browns hold the second overall pick in the NFL draft in two weeks following a disastrous 3-14 season. While there may be a couple of high-profile quarterbacks available in what is considered a quarterback-light draft, there’s a good chance Cleveland sees what they have in Pickett and decide to add talent elsewhere on the roster.Explore more on these topicsNFLCleveland BrownsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The agreement followed months of negotiations between the player, his agent Ramy Abbas Issa and Liverpool’s sporting director, Richard Hughes, and concludes a saga that at one point prompted a frustrated Salah to claim he was “more out than in”.Salah signs Liverpool contract, Amorim defends Onana, and more: football news – liveRead moreNo financial details have been disclosed but the 32-year-old has not taken a pay cut and the new deal reflects his elite status. His previous three-year contract was worth a basic £350,000 a week, although his overall earnings wereabout £1m a week. Performance-related bonuses can take his Liverpool wage closer to £500,000 a week. Virgil van Dijk is expected to also sign a new two-year contract soon.Salah will be 33 in June, 35 when his latest contract expires, but Slot believes age is not an issue for the Egypt international and has warned Liverpool’s rivals that his team could be even stronger next season.The head coach said: “It’s never easy for a player to stay at the levels we are on. They have to work really hard for that and that’s exactly what he does. If you look at his body, how much he takes care of his body, not only physically but also mentally, that gives him a very good chance to stay at this level longer than maybe other players can.“It’s not only he that will stay at a certain level, we have to stay at a certain level and then Mo will produce. Like I always say, we have to bring him in promising positions as much as we can. We have all the confidence in him that he can produce two more years of what he has produced in the past seven or eight years, because of the reasons I just gave you. But also because we will make this team very strong next season.”Salah is third on Liverpool’s all-time goalscorers’ list behind Ian Rush and Roger Hunt with 243 goals in 392 appearances. He has been instrumental in this season’s pursuit of the Premier League title and, despite being free to negotiate with foreign clubs from 1 January, has long been expected to extend his Anfield career. Slot said the better he got to know Salah, the more he had “the feeling that he would extend with us”. The Dutchman made several calls to Hughes earlier this season imploring him to finalise a new contract with the forward.“It’s great to be here another two years,” said Salah. “We have a great team now. Before also we had a great team. But I signed because I think we have a chance to win other trophies and enjoy my football. I had my best years here. I played eight years, hopefully it’s going to be 10.”Salah said his wife, Magi, and two young daughters had also wanted to stay on Merseyside and credited his relationship with Slot as another factor in his contentment at Liverpool. He said: “I think we have a good relationship. We understand each other on and off the field, which is very important. We have good communication, we discuss almost everything he wants me to improve and he wants from me. And also if I feel there’s something in doubt, I go and speak to him. That’s a great asset to have also as a manager.”Slot praised the Liverpool hierarchy for securing the services of a world-class talent who would have had numerous options as a free agent, including a move to the Saudi Pro League.“I’m part of the process but I don’t deserve the compliments,” Slot said. “First of all, it’s Mo’s choice and his agent’s choice and what he wants. Second of all, the club – FSG [Fenway Sports Group], Richard, Michael Edwards [FSG’s CEO of football] – put in a lot of effort to influence that. Effort mostly means money but not only money. What it might tell you is that it’s not only a good season this season but next season as well. Mo is convinced we have a fair chance of being able to do so. That’s positive. If you want to sign new players or players who want to extend here it is always a positive to see one of our star players has made the choice to extend his contract. It also shows how ambitious this club is: not only Mo, but the owners and the ones who came in last season, that we are really ambitious to keep performing the way this club has performed for so many years.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So there is not a lot more to come (from Salah), we are just trying to reach perfection. We will never reach it but we will reach excellence along the way. We brought almost the maximum out of Mo this season. Then it’s about consistency and that is why Mo is at the level he is. His mentality is so strong and it needs to be if you want to stay at the highest level for seven or eight years and perform every three days.”Van Dijk has confirmed progress is being made on his deal and Slot indicated a resolution could be close. “We will see what is going to happen in the upcoming weeks,” he said. “There is not a lot of time to go so you will get your answers in the next two months.” Trent Alexander-Arnold, who will also become a free agent this summer, is expected to join Real Madrid.Explore more on these topicsMohamed SalahLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Rice had never scored a free kick in 338 appearances but said Jover’s instructions “didn’t make sense” and opted to shoot instead after being encouraged by Bukayo Saka.“They have to make the decision,” said Arteta. “We are here to help them, to paint the picture of what the options are, but I loved it. When we talk about taking the next step, it is a lot about that: taking the initiative, making things happen on the pitch and believing you can actually win the game by yourself sometimes. I was really impressed with the way he did it.”The manager added: “It’s related to confidence as well and feeling and owning that moment, which is really important. So there’s no coincidence that all the top teams, you look at their games in the Champions League, the amount of individual moments that won the football matches … that’s a necessity.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arteta is expected to rest several players against Brentford on Saturday, although Rice and Saka have been passed fit after being substituted against Madrid.Mikel Arteta is hoping that Kai Havertz could return before the end of the season as the forward steps up his recovery from a hamstring injury. The Germany international had surgery after sustaining the injury in February during Arsenal’s training camp in Dubai and posted an update on X on Thursday with the message: “Step by step.” It also featured a video of his rehabilitation. Bukayo Saka has just returned from a similar injury that caused him to miss three months and the Champions League final on 31 May is a potential target for Havertz should Arsenal make it to Munich.“Let’s see,” Arteta said when asked whether Havertz could be back before the end of the season. “The mindset of those two is very, very similar. Great injury history, great work ethic, desperate to get back playing as quick as possible. And great medical staff as well to look after them. So hopefully we can have him, but let’s wait, I think. Once you get to the last stage of that rehab is when you can understand better how close or far you are to make that next step.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalChampions LeagueMikel ArtetanewsShareReuse this content"

I get the best out of myself’Suzanne WrackThe head coach on staying calm against Real Madrid, learning to cope with losing and the challenge of LyonFri 11 Apr 2025 10.26 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 13.53 EDTShare‘The tactical side is the easier part of the job because it’s like mathematics,” says Renée Slegers. “The challenging part is the people, in a positive way; that’s where the most energy goes, and I think that’s right.”The Arsenal manager is on a sofa in her office, relaxed and open as we talk about how much of coaching is psychological and how much is tactical. Is the psychological side the most enjoyable part of the job, then? “I like the combination,” says Slegers, after a short pause. “I like puzzles and board games and, for me, tactics are kind of a game, but then working with people I get so much energy. That’s inspiring.”After four Women’s Super League wins in March, Slegers has been named the Barclays WSL manager of the month for the third time, having picked up the award in December and February, but individual acclaim makes her “uncomfortable”. If Arsenal win at home to Leicester on Tuesday they will go three points behind the leaders, Chelsea, albeit having played a game more. Next Saturday comes the first leg of the Champions League semi-final, at home to Lyon.Clinical Russo leads Arsenal to epic comeback victory against Real MadridRead moreSlegers’ leadership style is focused on elevating those around her to do their jobs to the best of their ability. “I want to develop the team and that’s best done with finding the strengths in the people here in this building and empowering those strengths,” she says.“I believe that with clarity, role clarity, it becomes easier to perform. So we try to give as much clarity as possible to the players, which is always going to be a challenge because you can’t always give the clarity that a player wants … Everyone being able to be themselves, me included, is the environment I want.”There are no whiteboards in her office, although one long wall has scribblings on it. Below the word BELIEF, in capitals and underlined, is a list: “3 in 6”, “2 in 90” and “0-2 to 3-2”.Those numbers relate to their most recent games, the ones that show their mettle. The first example of that, though, arrived earlier. Arsenal coming from 2-1 down to beatBayern Munich 3-2 in Decemberhelped Slegers “see the light of what is possible and where we can go as a team”.“That was a key first moment,” she says. “Then, looking back at the last block of games that we’ve played, in the West Ham game at Meadow Park we go down and then turn the game around to win 4-3, scoring three goals in six minutes. In between the games against Real Madrid, after the 2-0 loss in Spain, we played Liverpool at the Emirates and we scored two goals in 90 minutes.” Less than two weeks earlier they had lost 1-0 to Liverpool in the FA Cup. “These games show us what we can do. We can do a lot of good things across 90 minutes, but 90 minutes is a long time and we don’t need a lot of time to be able to decide a game.”View image in fullscreenRenée Slegers celebrates with Beth Mead after the 4-3 WSL win over Manchester City in February.Photograph: Visionhaus/Getty ImagesThat is why, with Arsenal trailing Real by two goals in the Champions League quarter-final and the second leg goalless at half-time, the manager and her players were calm. “We were really detailed about the plan for the game and in our preparations and we had a lot of engagement from the players as well,” says Slegers. “We’d shown what we could do as a team in previous games and that enabled us to be so calm, even at half-time when we knew we needed at least three goals.”In the changing room, the players and staff could see in each other’s eyes that everyone was thinking the same things, full of composure and belief. “It was very special,” Slegers says. “Sometimes, players need to feel emotions and you need motivational and inspirational talks. That’s not what we needed in that moment. It was focused, it was high-performance. ”The growing, invested and vocal fanbase is a key element of the equation. “They’re a part of why we can be so calm and focus on problem solving. We don’t have to play the role of bringing the energy and the motivation because the fans bring that. So, all that work is off my shoulders and it’s amazing how people together can create something far bigger.”Arsenal scored three goals in a blistering 13 minutes against Real. “What we’re showing more and more, both the players and the staff, is that we thrive on pressure,” Slegers says. She includes herself in that. “I like to be under pressure. I get the best out of myself. I was like that in school. I wouldn’t get my work done until a couple of hours before a deadline.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAt half-time against Real, with the tension in the crowd palpable, how could she be so calm? “What I’ve learned about myself is that if I am calm then I make better decisions and I see things more clearly. That’s been a journey for me.”At 36, Slegers is a young manager, only two years older than Arsenal’s captain, Kim Little. After succeeding Jonas Eidevall at the Swedish side Rosengård she joined him at Arsenal as an assistant in September 2023 with a focus on working with players one-on-one.After Eidevall’s exit13 months later, Slegers was made interim head coach before being given the job permanently in January. Her rise has been rapid and the learning has come thick and fast. After a 13-game unbeaten run, Arsenal lost for the first time under her at the end of January, 1-0 at Chelsea in the WSL, bounced back with a 4-3 defeat of Manchester City in their next league match before losing 2-1 to City in the League Cup semi-finals.View image in fullscreenRenee Slegers leads by example with Leah Williamson and Kim Little.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty Images‘My biggest job beforehand, as a head coach, was at FC Rosengård and we basically won all the time because we were the best team in the league and so I wasn’t used to losing that much,” Slegers says. “We did lose in the Champions League group phase, but we were so far off. So, this was new for me, I learned a lot about myself.“You also gain an understanding of how people work and how people function in hard times and learn what you need to do to support players, people, to be able to get back on track again and keep on going. You learn how to push the right buttons with everyone. The day after a loss, we are more vulnerable and emotional, and accepting that and finding the right strategies for managing it is important. That’s what we tried to do with the whole staff and playing group, and I’m happy with the way the team responded and got back on it so quickly after those losses, because they were big losses for us. We wanted more in the cup competitions especially.”What did she learn about herself? “I still get emotional about results,” she says. “I have bad nights of sleep and I beat myself up, but not as badly as I would a couple of years ago. I would spin, take all the responsibility for everything that had happened and I would be a mess. I didn’t have a strategy or understanding of how to deal with those emotions. I feel much more composed now. I understand it. If I’ve had a bad night’s sleep, I’m aware I’m tired and will still be emotional and I know that the second day after a defeat is the best day for me to analyse what exactly happened and how we need to move forward.”There are more big tests of her and Arsenal’s resilience to come. They have four WSL games left and a tricky Champions League semi-final against the eight-time champions. “We need to believe in what we are good at, stick to our identity, but then also be very aware of who they are and what they are going to try to do,” Slegers says of facing Lyon. There is also an opportunity for her to show how far she has come as a coach. In the opposition dugout the former Arsenal manager Joe Montemurro will be a familiar face, and not just to the players. He was Slegers’ mentor on the Uefa coach mentor programme during his time in London.Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenWomen's Champions LeagueWomen's footballWomen's Super LeagueinterviewsShareReuse this content"

In the buildup the former United midfielder Nemanja Matic described the Cameroonian as“one of the worst goalkeepers in Man United’s history”– and Onana failed to dispel the claim.Erik ten Hag brought in Onanafrom Inter in July 2023to replace David de Gea, one of the best keepers United have had but who was allowed to leave for nothing, and the decision has never looked justified. Onana cost about £45m a year after he was available for free, in another strange recruitment decision by United. De Gea took a year off before returning this season with Fiorentina, where he has again shown himself to be one of the continent’s finest, to make the situation more painful for United fans.Ruben Amorim ‘really confident’ in André Onana despite errors in Lyon drawRead moreA key reason for the change was Onana’s superior use of the ball with his feet but glovework is quite important. The Lyon opener was the eighth time Onana has committed an error leading to a goal in his United career – the equaliser the ninth. Thiago Almada’s curling free-kick should have been dealt with but a lack of anticipation allowed it to elude everyone and beat a belatedly diving Onana. In the 95th minute he failed to hold a shot, enabling Rayan Cherki to pounce and deflate United.“If you play football and you play a lot of games, you can make mistakes,”Ruben Amorim said of his goalkeeper. One problem Onana has faced is a lack of rest since he came to England. Ten Hag played him 51 times in his first season at Old Trafford and Onana also made five appearances for Cameroon, including a short trip to the Africa Cup of Nations in January after debating whether he wanted to go.How Onana compares with previous United goalkeepersThe backup Altay Bayindir appeared once last season when Onana was away for Afcon. Ten Hag played his first choice in every Carabao Cup and FA Cup fixture for which he was available. Goalkeepers are often overlooked when it comes to rest and rotation. Although their position does not include as much physical exertion it is mentally demanding, with the need always to be switched on.Bayindir has been afforded six cup starts this season and was the hero in theFA Cup shootout win against Arsenalbut Amorim has had a lengthy period of naming untried academy goalkeepers on the bench with the Turkey international and the third choice, Tom Heaton, injured. Heaton is available again but the 38-year‑old’s most recent first-team appearance came in February 2023 and he is highly unlikely to add to the figure before his contract expires in the summer.View image in fullscreenManchester United’s André Onana cuts a forlorn figure after the draw in Lyon.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersUnited are not prolific scorers, making it imperative they are tight in defence. They have 37 goals from 31 Premier League games but have conceded 41. According to Opta, Onana has the worst league clean sheet record for a United goalkeeper who has played more than 900 minutes since its records began in 2003-04. The 29-year-old has kept out opponents in 26.1% of his 69 league appearances, whereas De Gea’s record was 35.4% across 415 appearances. Roy Carroll leads the list with a ratio more than twice as good as Onana’s at 53.1%. Only Anders Lindegaard has a worse save percentage rate than Onana’s 70.1%.Admittedly, Carroll was protected by Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Gabriel Heinze, among others, for much of his United career. None of United’s current defenders will go down as club legends, their flaws well documented.Quick GuideAmorim praises Zirkzee responseShowRuben Amorim has praised Joshua Zirkzee for his response to being replaced after 33 minutes of Manchester United’s 2-0 loss to Newcastle at Old Trafford on 30 December. The team travel to Newcastle for Sunday’s 4.30pm kick-off.When the head coach took off the forward in the reverse fixture, Zirzkee was jeered by some United fans. Amorim said the Dutchman had since shown character, aided by the supporters. Zirkzee scored for United in Thursday's 2-2 draw at Lyon, his third goal in 20 appearances since that substitution.“He is doing a great job,” Amorim said. “But also a very important thing was the way the fans reacted after that incident. Even if Josh is not playing, if you see every time he gets on the pitch or is just warming up our fans sing the Josh song. That is massive for the boy. So it's 50-50: 50% the fans and 50% on the part of Josh.”Amorim was asked what he did to address the situation. “I explained the situation,” he said. “When a player, I wanted to hear some explanation from the coaches on [this kind of thing]. And then I worked with him - and he is improving, putting it into play.”Zirkzee’s 87th-minute header at Lyon gave United them a 2-1 lead in their Europa League quarter-final first leg. The 23-year-old said: “I trained headers this past week, so if you want to call it coincidence, but for it to happen this way was very nice.”Amorim said he would have no  players back for Newcastle.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Since Onana joined United, no Premier League goalkeeper has made more errors leading to goals (nine) in all competitions. In the league this season, Onana has made three such errors, putting him behind Ipswich’s Arijanet Muric, Chelsea’s Robert Sánchez and Bart Verbruggen of Brighton. Onana’s save percentage is 67.7%, placing him in 12th, perhaps a suitable placing for a mid-table goalkeeper.Onana has made three errors leading to goals in the Premier League this seasonGoalkeepers are often creatures of habit, wanting the same defenders in front of them and stability in training. Onana has not been afforded either, playing behind a cast of thousands in defence through a mixture of injuries and Amorim’s desperate attempts to find a combination that works. At Carrington he has found the situation somewhat erratic and had three goalkeeping coaches in his first year and a half with the club. They all have different methods and demands.United travel to face Newcastle on Sunday and Onana is likely to play again but he knows the pressure is growing. Considering the desire for personnel changes in other positions and the financial situation, Amorim will be reluctant to target a new goalkeeper but things need to improve quickly for Onana or Matic’s words will be his Old Trafford epitaph.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Tunisia midfielder darted on to Josh Cullen’s inch-perfect free-kick into the penalty area and kept his composure to steer a low finish beyond Angus Gunn for his first goal for the club.Norwich wasted the chance of an immediate response as the unmarked Kellen Fisher headed straight at James Trafford six yards out from Kenny McLean’s excellent cross.Burnley were buoyed by their early breakthrough and their crisp interplay was easy on the eye as Norwich struggled to contain them. And, while the second goal came via a big deflection, it was no less than Burnley deserved. Anthony’s shot from outside the box struck the Norwich captain, Shane Duffy, on the back and wrongfooted Gunn in the 24th minute.View image in fullscreenHannibal Mejbri fires the ball past Angus Gunn to put Burnley ahead.Photograph: Paul Currie/ShutterstockParker’s side had conceded only five goals at Turf Moor this season before Norwich’s visit and the visitors passed up another clear chance to make that six shortly before half-time.

But Johannes Hoff Thorup’s side, with Josh Sargent to the fore, began to pose Burnley problems of their own. Stacey, a 67th-minute replacement for Emiliano Marcondes, hauled Norwich back in it in the 76th minute to set up a nervous finale.McLean headed a corner goalwards and Stacey was first to react, turning the ball home from close range for a rare goal conceded by Trafford on home soil.

The manager, who made clear the individual was not a player or one of their agents, chose to go public out of exasperation and in the hope the person will come to his or her senses and stop.Postecoglou, who is under fire after a disappointing season, has spoken of late about the challenges he has faced in creating the right culture at Spurs. He has asked why, for example, he is almost always the lone spokesperson for the club and wondered why there were no other strong voices, including pundits, who defended their positions in public. Mole-gate is the latest issue although, according to Postecoglou, it dates back to the beginning of last season.Aston Villa in talks with Uefa over deal after breach of squad cost rulesRead moreThe subject came up as Postecoglou was questioned about Wilson Odobert’s fitness and at about the same time – on an unrelated note – that Spurs announced the hire of the former Arsenal chief executive Vinai Venkatesham. He will join in the summer and take the same title that he held at Arsenal, which would appear to be bad news for Spurs’s chief football officer, Scott Munn.It was widely reported on Thursday that Odobert had hurt a hamstring and, that night, the winger was an unused substitute in the1-1 home draw against Eintracht Frankfurtin the Europa League quarter-final first- eg.“There is no doubt we have got a leak inside the club – somebody who continues to leak out information,” Postecoglou said, during a break in the preparations for Sunday’s Premier League game at Wolves. “It just makes our job more difficult because we don’t want on-game-day opposition being aware of any sort of team selection.“We’ve narrowed it down. We’ve been looking at it for quite a while and we have a fair idea of where it is coming from. It’s disappointing because you’d like to think everyone who is in our camp is working with us, not against us.”It was put to Postecoglou that disgruntled players had long complained to their agents who, in turn, chatted to journalists. “It’s not agents, definitely not agents,” Postecoglou said. “The stuff that is coming out is pretty specific. The language used is not used by agents, trust me.“It’s definitely not the players because for me the information that is getting out is … Look, I’ve always said, especially with medical information, I’m really, really careful [with it]. I know everyone thinks these things should be carte blanche in terms of information flow but I’m still very respectful in terms of medical records and how much information we actually give on certain things.“The fact that it is getting out is unacceptable from a club perspective. I’ve got enough challenges out there without adding more.”Postecolgou agreed that culture was one of the most important things in any organisation. “One hundred per cent,” he said. “That’s the bit that we’re constantly trying to change, trying to get the club to a place where there is a real strong mentality and identity of who we are. And to protect that and make sure we have the right professional mindset in every aspect.”Postecoglou said there were “various ways” of uncovering a mole, which led to mention of Coleen Rooney and the infamous Wagatha Christie case. “You just look where the information goes and it’s pretty easy to figure out,” he said. “There’s always a bit of detective work in football management. This is a cultural thing. I’m big on creating a culture of success and I don’t think successful organisations behave in that manner.”Who would be Postecoglou’s fictional detective of choice? “Reacher,” he replied. “Just get out the big bat and pummel people!”Postecoglou desperately needs to win the Europa League to make up for his team’s domestic underachievement and give him a chance to remain in the job. He had a quip at the ready when he discussed the future of Son Heung-min, whose contract expires in June 2026. “At the end of the season, there will be a point of review where we look at where we are as a squad and do some forward-planning – if I’m here, mate,” he said.Munn has to be feeling the heat, too. The Australian was appointed in April 2023, although he would not start at Spurs until September of that year after a delayed exit from his previous role as the chief executive of the City Football Group China. Postecoglou was hired in June 2023.Munn was placed in charge of all footballing departments, including medical – which has come under such scrutiny during a season of injury misery. It is understood Venkatesham will take responsibility for all operational matters on and off the field. The 44-year-old, who left Arsenal at the end of last season after 14 years there in a variety of roles – mainly commercial – was formerly a member of the board and executive committee of the European Club Association.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurAnge PostecoglounewsShareReuse this content"

The local government admitted French police used teargas but said it was “proportionate” to restore calm.Posts on social media showed United fans feeling the effect of the spray at the Europa League quarter-final first leg. The Rhône prefecture said in a statement: “English fans were seated in the away section waiting to be allowed to join their bus. They attempted to force their way through the security measures deployed by the national police. Projectiles were also reported to be thrown at the police. The police therefore used moderate, proportionate and necessary force (tear gas) to restore calm.André Onana has to improve or face being swept away in Amorim reshuffleRead more“All the English supporters were then led to the buses to leave the stadium. It was a very brief moment and the rest of the event went well overall. We are committed to doing everything possible to welcome foreign supporters in safe conditions.”Football Supporters Europe criticised the police, claiming teargas was used after fans were prevented from using the toilets. Ronan Evain, FSE’s executive director, said: “It is completely unacceptable that the police would think it’s OK to stop people from going to the toilets – then the reaction to it is completely disproportionate. It is human nature that people will lose their temper if the police take away basic elements of basic human dignity like being allowed to go to the toilet.“The police are responsible for creating this tension, for escalating it instead of taking the only logical decision in this situation, which is to permit people to go to the toilet, even if it’s only small groups. That they’re choosing to escalate this even further [via the spray] can’t be justified.”Duncan Drasdo, the Manchester United Supporters Trust chief executive, posted on X: “90 percent of the time on Euro aways if there is aggro it’s with the police rather than local fans. Most countries can do this right but there are almost always problems with the French police. All too often they create the aggro they are supposed to be preventing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although the wages of non-football staff do not count towards Uefa SCR calculations, the Guardian has been told their player costs exceeded the 80% cap last season, when Unai Emery’s side reached the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League.Villa have not commented on their compliance or otherwise with Uefa’s regulations, although they provided an indication they may be found in breach in their 2023-24 financial report. A note in their accounts stated that “we continue to operate within the Premier League’s Profit [sic] and Sustainability Rules” (PSR), but Uefa’s SCR was not mentioned.Villa were fined £52,000 by Uefa last year for late submission of accounts and are facing another financial penalty. They will be involved in the decision-making process. The CFCB operates independently from Uefa’s leadership with a brief to facilitate compliance with the regulations.The CFCB is likely to make Villa submit to a spending plan and give itself powers to impose tougher sanctions if the club fail to stick to it. Roma were fined £1.75m for repeated breaches in 2023 and Istanbul Basaksehir were given a suspended one-year ban from Uefa competitions and put under a registration embargo last year.Villa are unlikely to be given such severe penalties at this stage, although the CFCB will insist they cut their wage bill. The club may struggle to comply with SCR this season without raising revenue by selling players in June.A summer sale of players including Douglas Luiz, Omari Kellyman and Tim Iroegbunam which raised almost £70m was required for Villa to comply with the Premier League’s PSR regulations last summer. The club spent the second half of last season lobbying for the three-year permitted losses limit be increased from £105m to £135m but their proposal failed to get sufficient support at the Premier League’s AGM.Chelsea are also in negotiations with the CFCB, because although SCR rules did not apply to them last season given they did not play in Europe, the club appear to have breached Uefa’s three-year loss limit of £170m. Uefa’s financial regulations do not allow clubs to declare income from selling assets to sister companies, as Chelsea have done twice in the past two financial years through the sale of two hotels at Stamford Bridge and their women’s club to BlueCo 22 for a combined £275.2m.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The club should have no problem complying with SCR if they qualify for Europe next season, however, because the owners have reduced the wage bill to £338m from £404m the previous season. Their 2023-24 revenue fell to £468.5m in the absence of Champions League or any European football.Aston Villa and Uefa declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsAston VillaUefaFinancesFootball politicsFinancial fair playnewsShareReuse this content"

Crystal Palace visit the Etihad Stadium on Saturday lunchtime and a City would jump two places to fourth with a win, temporarily at least.Top-five tussle: how Premier League battle for Champions League spots is shaping upRead more“If you want to be in the Champions League next season and play Tuesday, Wednesday, you have to win almost all the games,” Guardiola said. “Now it’s not very complicated. We don’t have 15, 20 games, now we have seven games left. It’s a final every single game. We have to win a lot of games to qualify, because Newcastle play just one game a week, and the quality of Aston Villa, and all the teams are involved, Chelsea and Nottingham [Forest].”City play only Villa of their immediate Champions League during the run-in. Guardiola, asked whether he had a final tally in mind, joked: “With 21, we will be there, that’s for sure.”Guardiola is without Erling Haaland, John Stones, Nathan Aké, Manuel Akanji and Rodri, and Phil Foden is a doubt. “They’re still injured,” the manager said. “It has happened all season. We adapt. You can see it as a problem or a challenge. You could see the position as a disaster, but it could be worse. I’m really satisfied for the way we’ve handled it.”City will be looking to improve on their performance in lastSunday’s goalless Manchester derby. “Some spirit is back,” Guardiola said. “Some games were good – United no – and the spirit is there. The spirit will sustain us. Maybe we struggle in a game but the spirit has to be there. The main reason is we don’t have players, we had a lot of injuries. We couldn’t rotate, they couldn’t compete against each other and in certain moments we needed fight and we didn’t have legs. We didn’t have energy. I know they want it but they could not.”Explore more on these topicsPep GuardiolaManchester CitynewsShareReuse this content"

After all, the difference between their previous tally of eight ticket resale partners and nine is pretty marginal and, besides, it was stipulated that tickets would not be taken from ordinary fans but from the existing allocation of hospitality seats. But the story touched a nerve and at the next home game thousands responded to the call from three supporters’ groups to leave their seats empty until the ninth minute.“These resellers, they don’t offer anything of value,” Chris Neville, secretary of one of the fan groups, Trade Union Blues, told the BBC. “They have a completely parasitical business model where they take something that already exists and sell it for a profit. We’re loyal fans. We don’t object to people who want to come to Manchester and have a good time and take in a City game. What we object to is the fact the club now seems to be prioritising these fans over longstanding loyal fans.”This fear appears well grounded, for reasons the club’s leadership has never made any attempt to hide. Ferran Soriano, City’s chief executive, made his approach to match days absolutely clear ina speech he gaveat the World Government Summit in Dubai in 2014. “There has been a major change in the business model,” he said. “Twenty years ago, 30 years ago, what was the business model of a football club? It was the same as a circus in the sense that you get the money from people going to the stadium to watch a show live. This is where you get the money. That’s it.View image in fullscreenEmpty seats amongst the home fans as Manchester City supporters take part in a planned protest against ticket reselling in the opening minutes of the Premier League game against Leicester City.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA“The business model is not a circus any more. The business model looks similar to Walt Disney or Warner Bros. Walt Disney has characters, Mickey Mouse; Warner Bros, Bugs Bunny. With a character they do TV programmes, movies. They have theme parks. They sell shirts and caps. A football club does the same thing – we don’t have Mickey Mouse, we have Sergio Agüero. And with Sergio Agüero, we sell shirts, we sell caps, we sell TV programmes – the games. We have a theme park – the stadium. So our business today, the business of a football club, is very similar to any big media company. It’s not a circus any more.”The problem with long-term fans, the indefatigable old-timers who turn up week in and week out for year after year, is that they tend not to see the ground as a theme park, or to buy many caps and shirts. “To a certain extent season-ticket holders have outlived their usefulness,” says Kieran Maguire, an associate professor in football finance at the University of Liverpool and co-host of the Price of Football podcast. “If I’m a Championship club and I’m trying to get my ground three-quarters full I need my season-ticket holders there. For smaller clubs, the benefit of season-ticket holders is clear. But Manchester United could easily sell 80,000 tickets to 80,000 different people every home fixture. For the elite clubs, season-ticket holders are bedblockers to a certain extent. They tend to be older and if they buy merchandise they buy it once a season. Tourists are more likely to empty their wallets on overpriced tat in the club shop.”Manchester City freeze ticket prices for next season after fan protestRead moreLiverpool gave a clear indication of their attitude to long-term fans last year, when the opening of a redeveloped Anfield Road Stand boosted the stadium’s capacity by 7,000. Their season-ticket waiting list runs very comfortably into five figures, and is so unwieldy it has been closed since 2017; some people have been on it for more than a quarter of a century, patiently waiting their turn. For most, this was not it: they got only 1,000 of the new tickets, the rest earmarked for occasional or one-off visitors. Manchester City’s plans for their North Stand, currently being redeveloped, include “new premium, seated areas”, with the club hoping to entrench their position as “a world-class entertainment destinationfor fans and global visitors alike”.Resale partners help clubs access international fans while distancing themselves from the high prices charged. Many offer tickets to matches across Europe, and by default list prices in dollars or euros; one major reseller, listing tickets at nine Premier League grounds, has sold packages through Expedia, Groupon and Thomas Cook; another is based in Israel; Liverpool have partners in Sweden and Denmark. But these ticket offers do not just populate home areas with tourists, they offer an easy route in for away fans, with sometimes violent results.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s Anfield Road Stand boosted the stadium’s capacity by 7,000 but only 1,000 people on the waiting list got season tickets.Photograph: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty ImagesManchester City have also struggled to police their exchange scheme, which allows anyone who pays a £35 fee to access, at face value, seats returned by season‑ticket holders. Many of those tickets have ended up in the hands of away fans – before February’sFA Cup tie against Plymouth, City cancelled nearly 250 snaffled by first-time buyers living within 30 miles of Home Park – or of touts, and this season more than 500 accounts have been suspended or closed for touting. Last year City recruited a ticket compliance officer to help them regain control.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Commercially, that absolutely makes sense.”Season-ticket holders tend to see themselves as the heartbeat of their clubs, as keepers of the flame, essential, irreplaceable. But it is increasingly clear that some clubs see them as more hindrance than help and are slowly, quietly starting to squeeze them out. As City’s protesting fans seem to have realised, the consequences may be anything but Mickey Mouse.Explore more on these topicsFootball ticket pricesManchester CityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Down a set and a break against a cunning opponent, the British No 1 had been junkballed into oblivion and defeat drew near. Her recent difficult form and her lack of confidence in the surface beneath her feet was plain for ll to see.From that uncomfortable position, Boulter showed her mental fortitude in full as she emerged with a strong 1-6, 6-3, 6-1 win over Tatjana Maria to clinch a 2-1 win for Great Britain over Germany in their opening tie of theBillie Jean King Cupqualifiers in the Hague.Alex de Minaur records first ‘double bagel’ with whitewash of Grigor DimitrovRead moreEarlier on Friday, Sonay Kartal produced an impressive 6-4, 6-2 win over the world No 120 Jule Niemeier on her BJK Cup debut. The tie concluded with a 6-4, 6-1 win for Laura Siegemund and Anna-Lena Friedsam over Harriet Dart and Olivia Nicholls in the doubles rubber.Great Britain will now face the Netherlands on Saturday in a match that will determine the group winner and participant in the BJK Cup Finals, which take place in Shenzhen, China in September. The Netherlands defeated Germany 3-0 on Thursday.The BJK Cup remains an event in flux after the ITF opted to align the tournament with the Davis Cup by reducing the number of teams in its Finals tournament from 12 to eight. As the event shifts to its new format, the finalists will be decided in this clunky three-team group stage before reverting to traditional home and away ties next year.Despite an unsurprisingly sparse turnout at the indoor clay courts in Sportcampus Zuiderpark for the neutral tie of the week, only a couple hundred fans present, both sets of travelling fans created a solid atmosphere.The tie began with a significant breakthrough moment for the fast-improving Kartal. Now the British No 3, over the past year the 23-year-old has won her first career WTA title and has established herself as a top 100 player. She further fortified her position among the elite last month by reaching the fourth round in Indian Wells and rising to a new career high of No 60.View image in fullscreenSonay Kartal chases down the ball during her victory over Jule Niemeier.Photograph: Nathan Stirk/Getty Images for LTAIn a sport filled with tall, imposing athletes, at 5ft 4in Kartal is a diminutive competitor but she ground down an increasingly erratic Niemeier with her consistency, depth and defensive skills. Kartal also smartly chose her moments to force herself inside the baseline and impose herself with a heavy forehand. With a professional, assured performance, Kartal closed out her first BJK Cup victory.“I’m so proud to get a debut like that,” said Kartal. “In terms of how up there it is in my career, it’s probably my second biggest achievement [after winning her first match at Wimbledon]. Personally, it’s one that I’ve wanted to get ticked off for a long time.”There were ample questions surrounding Boulter, who is still finding her form after a foot injury in February and has a tough record on clay, as she entered the court.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Forced to generate her own pace on every last shot, Boulter was continually baited into overhitting and her unforced error count rose.To her credit, Boulter dug deep and she impressively found her way by closing down the net earlier and making some key volleys before ending the match with a supreme exhibition of shotmaking. From 1-6, 2-3 down, Boulter completely overpowered Maria, winning 10 of the final 11 games.“I pride myself on being a fighter and knowing that I can get myself out of those moments,” said Boulter. “I feel like that’s probably experience. There’s not many times I can count in this competition that I felt like I’ve lost a match convincingly.”Explore more on these topicsBillie Jean King CupKatie BoulterTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s pretty crazy!”De Minaur, the world No 10, had expected a tough duel against the evergreen Dimitrov but after dominating the early stages, seemed to drain all the belief and confidence out of the 33-year-old and then never took his foot off the pedal as the Bulgarian just coughed up more unforced errors, 23 in all.After winning the first set 6-0 in just 23 minutes – the first time Dimitrov has failed to win a game in any stanza for nine years – de Minaur earned another break at the start of the second with a dazzling backhand lob that just continued the strangulation.Getting only stronger and more aggressive as the one-sided fare progressed, de Minaur dropped only 15 out of the 63 points played to become the first Australian since John Alexander in 1979 to make the semi-finals of the famous old tournament in the Principality.He’s also the first Australian since Lleyton Hewitt in Hamburg in 2007 to reach a Masters 1000 clay-court semi-final as he chalked up a tour-leading 20th win of the season.De Minaur will face either nemesis Stefanos Tsitsipas or Italian Lorenzo Musetti in the last four.But hopes of two Australians making the semis were earlier dashed on the same court when Alexei Popyrin’s best tournament of the year was ended with the Sydneysider being well beaten 6-3 6-2 by Spain’s Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in 69 minutes.Match of the day, though, featured Carlos Alcaraz’s fabulous, hard-fought victory over young French gun Arthur Fils, the 20-year-old rising talent who will be ruing his missed opportunities after going down 4-6 7-5 6-3 in a thrilling contest on Rainier.Explore more on these topicsAlex de MinaurAustralia sportTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

It means a career haul of 1,126 first-class wickets will only swell further.“Congratulations SirJimmy Anderson,” said Richard Thompson, the current chair of the England and Wales Cricket Board. “This is a really well-deserved honour for an England legend who has given so much to our sport.“Jimmy’s career has been marked by extraordinary achievements, not least in winning the Ashes four times and becoming England’s all-time leading wicket-taker.“His skill, determination, and sportsmanship have inspired millions of cricketers and fans alike, in England and around the world.“This is fitting recognition for a true world-great who has given so much to the game on and off the field.”View image in fullscreenJimmy Anderson bowls during an Ashes Test at Old Trafford in 2023.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAnderson, whose 188 Test caps are second only to India’s Sachin Tendulkar (200), is the third English cricketer of his generation to receive the honour, with former teammates Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook both knighted back in 2019.Lancashire’s director of cricket performance, Mark Chilton, said:“Everybody associated with LancashireCricketis incredibly proud of James. “His contribution to the game of cricket, spanning across three decades, has been immense and he is extremely deserving of this honour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And then there are the times when he plays the way he did around the second nine at Augusta National on Friday, and you remember all over again.Everyone who loves golf loves McIlroy’s game. Hell, all three of Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tom Watson picked him out as the man they wanted to win this week.The Masters 2025: day two updates from Augusta – liveRead moreMcIlroy’s chances were supposed to be at the bottom of that pond on 15, after he dropped two shots there in the opening round. He blew his approach over the back of the green and mis-hit a chip that skittered into the water. Augusta National allows you one big miss, but it’s rarely so generous as to gift you two. In McIlroy’s lifetime, no one has won the tournament while making more than one double bogey along the way. McIlroy had just had his one. And then, his mind still on the 15th, he went and three-putted the 17th too.Written off for another year (in this very paper, by ahem, this very journalist, among many others), McIlroy ground his way around the first nine on Friday in one under par, which left him seven shots off Justin Rose’s lead. There was a solitary birdie on the par-five 2nd, made from an impossible position after his drive fetched up right behind a tree trunk, but nothing much else in it to give you any hint of what was going to happen when he reached Amen Corner .View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy completes his 66 on the 18th green.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersIt all started on the 10th, where McIlroy uncorked an iron shot that landed two-feet from the pin, for a tap-in birdie. Then, at the 11th, one of the very hardest holes on the course, he whistled in another to five feet and picked up a second. The gallery was with him now; when the ball went in people down at Amen Corner were whooping and cheering and roaring and screaming. Everyone’s attention had switched to his corner of the course, and people came striding over from the 5th and the 7th and the 17th to join the throng.At the 13th, McIlroy drove into the pine straw at the very front edge of the copse in the outside bend of the dog leg. From there, it was 190 yards to the front of the green.“It wasn’t even a decision to go for it or not,” said McIlroy afterwards. And then the minute he hit it he said to himself: “‘You idiot, what have you done?’” Well, it turned out what he had done was land right by the top of the bank and, glory be, set himself up an eagle putt, which he made from nine feet. Then he saved par with a wedge on 14, which was possibly the best shot of the lot, from deep into the trees, through a pack of patrons, high on to the back of the green, 17 feet past the pin. Which brings us right back to where we started, on the 15th fairway.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bhatia thought about trying for the green, but decided against it at the last minute. McIlroy, though, didn’t give it a second thought. “I can’t watch,” whispered someone in the gallery. “If he leans down to the side after he’s hit it I’m walking away,” said another. McIlroy settled, and swung, and the ball was up and away into the bright blue sky, across the pond, and on to the far right corner of the green, where it landed with flop, right at the top of the slope to the water, and stopped 85 feet shy of the hole.“It was a little touch and go,” McIlroy admitted, “even where the ball finished sort of on the slope, I was thinking of running to mark it to make sure it wasn’t going to run back down the hill.”He hurried on down, and made a lag putt to set up his fourth birdie of the round, to go with that eagle on 13. It meant he scored 31 on the second nine, for a six‑under 66 that pushed him back up the leaderboard. Whatever you may have read, or heard, or said, on Friday morning, he is in contention again going into the weekend.“I don’t think I proved anything. If anything, I just backed up the belief that I have in myself,” McIlroy said. “I’m as resilient as anyone else out here.” And a whole lot bolder, besides.Explore more on these topicsThe MastersRory McIlroyEuropean TourGolfPGA TourUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

In tit-for-tat moves, Trump has raised total tariffs on China to 145%, while China responded on Friday byincreasing its levies on US exports to 125%.The border taxes make the goods trade between the two countries prohibitively expensive and mean cars imported from the US are now much less attractive inChinathan those produced locally.New orders for the two imported models were also no longer available on Tesla’s mini-program account on the Chinese social media app WeChat, Reuters reported. The “order now” buttons were replaced with “view available cars” for the Model S and Model X on the US carmaker’s website, with some remaining cars appearing to be available for Chinese buyers.Since 2020 Tesla has produced its Model 3 and Model Y cars in a large factory in Shanghai, giving it some insulation from the tariffs. However, the company is still likely to be heavily affected. Analysis by Nikkei Asia in 2023 suggested that about 40% of the companies supplying Tesla with battery materials were Chinese, although the carmaker has sought to source parts and materials from outside China as trade tensions between the US and China have increased.Musk has been a key player in the Trump administration, leading the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, in its efforts to slash the US federal budget that have beendescribed as illegal by constitutional experts. Yet he has also appeared to criticise the tariffs, saying last week that there should be“zero tariffs” between the EU and US. That is a stark contradiction to the 10% tariffs imposed by Trump on every nation in the world for 90 days, with the threat of the return of even higher levies.Tesla last month warned the US government that tariffs could harm American companies, in a letter to the White House’s trade representative.The possible loss of orders would represent a significant financial blow to Tesla, at a time when it is already struggling withslumping demand, particularly in Europe. Although it is tricky to work out the motivations of buyers, analysts have said that Musk’sclose association with Trump has tarnished the brand, contributing to the sales slump. The company also has an ageing lineup of models that are struggling to compete with newer offerings, particularly from Chinese rivals such as BYD.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the two men have been at loggerheads for years over its direction as it transitions from a complex non-profit structure into a more traditional for-profit business.Musk sued OpenAI over its restructuring plans about a year ago, accusing it ofbetraying its foundational missionby putting the pursuit of profit ahead of the benefit of humanity. He dropped the suit in June, butthen filed a fresh onein August.In February this year he led a consortium of investors in asurprise $97.4bn bid for the company. Altman quickly rejected the bid, writing on X: “no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.” Musk bought Twitter, since rebranded as X, in 2022 for $44bn.In documents filed at a district court in California this week,OpenAIsaid: “Through press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk’s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI’s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI.”The company asked the judge to stop Musk from any further attacks, as well as “be held responsible for the damage he has already caused”. A jury trial is expected to begin in spring 2026.Musk left OpenAI in 2018 and the world’s richest man started his own company called xAI. The bid for OpenAI this year was backed by xAI and several investment firms, including one run by Joe Lonsdale, who co-founded the spy technology company Palantir.The Tesla boss has openly accused OpenAI of abandoning its original charitable mission by establishing a for-profit subsidiary to raise money from investors, such as Microsoft. OpenAI, which was founded as a non-profit with the aim of safely building futuristic AI that helped humanity, has argued the new model is necessary to develop the best AI models.Last month OpenAI raised $40bn in a funding round from SoftBank and other investorsthat valued the company at $300bn. The company has said it plans to use the money to “push the frontiers of AI research even further” and develop its computer infrastructure to deliver more powerful tools for the estimated 500 million people who use ChatGPT every week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These changes, which some saw as aligning Meta with the then incoming Trump administration, informed the LDF’s decision to leave the civil rights advisory group.That month, following Meta’s decision to its changes, the LDF joined a coalition of other civil rights organisations that were part of Meta’s external civil rights advisory group to express discontent with the company’s decision.“These changes are devastating for free expression because they will subject members of protected groups to more attacks, harassment, and harm, driving them off Meta’s services, impoverishing conversations, eliminating points of view, and silencing dissenting and oft-censored voices,” the companieswrote in a 14 January letterto Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. “Meta has apparently entirely failed to consider the chilling effect of its policy changes – and the result will be more self-censorship, not less.”Those concerns are still crucial for the LDF.“I am deeply disturbed and disappointed by Meta’s announcement on January 7, 2025, of irresponsible changes to the content moderation policies on its platforms that pose grave risks to the health and safety of Black communities and risk further destabilizing our republic,” the LDF associate director counsel Todd A Coxwrote in a letterdated 11 April.“For nearly a decade, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (LDF) has invested a great deal of time and resources working with Meta as part of an informal committee advising the company on civil rights issues. Yet Meta made these content moderation policy changes without consulting or warning this group, and many of the changes directly conflict with guidance from LDF and partners. As a result, LDF can no longer in good conscience participate as part of Meta’s civil rights advisory committee.”The LDF also took issue with Meta’s decision to roll back itsDEI policies. Before Meta’s January decision, the company reported success with its DEI initiatives: the company doubled the number of Black and Hispanic employees in the US two years ahead of its goal. Per a statement, the LDF is concerned that reversing DEI policies “could reinforce discriminatory barriers to employment at Meta and further exacerbate the potential for harm to Black communities using Meta’s platforms”.In ina separate letter to Meta, also dated 11 April, Cox wrote: “While Meta has altered its policies, its obligations under federal civil rights laws are unchanged. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other civil rights laws prohibit discrimination in the workplace, including disparate treatment, workplace policies that have an unfair disproportionate effect, and hostile work environment. Nor have the Trump administration’s false attacks on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility programs changed the legality of these efforts. If Meta fails its antidiscrimination obligations due to the absence of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility programs, it exposes itself to further legal liability.”In a statement, Cox said that “the grave impacts of Meta’s policy changes cannot be understated”.“Our country is in a perilous moment,” he said. “Meta’s changes exacerbate the risks to the health and safety of our communities. We hope that Meta reconsiders these policy changes. At minimum, we hope that Meta will evaluate whether the Community Notes system effectively reduces user engagement with false content. We also hope that Meta publicly reports the hateful posts on its platform and publicly discloses how the policy changes impact the number of posts that are reported and removed. To this end, we hope Meta will cooperate with the various scholars collecting this data and evaluating its impact on users.”Meta did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsMetaDEI policiesnewsShareReuse this content"

They rise to 70ft (21 metres), tilt forward and zip away in different directions, each carrying a paper bag.On a sleepy morning in the Irish capital the takeoffs build to a steady one every few minutes, with barely anyone glancing at the constant stream of aircraft buzzing back and forth.“No one’s looking up – no one ever looks up,” says the man responsible, Bobby Healy, the founder of the Dublin startup Manna Aero.People probably should take notice, because the drones are part of an effort to realise an ambition shared byAmazon, the Google sister company Wing and the Californian startup Zipline: instant, autonomous home delivery. Healy and his big-tech rivals hope drone delivery will change the course of the retail industry across Ireland, and then into the UK as soon as this year.Drones have already made a huge impact on things ranging from photography to light shows, humanitarian missions to thewar in Ukraine. The promise is obvious: skip terrestrial congestion. However, the companies now have to persuade investors and the public. Previous Wingtrials in Australia faced public opposition.View image in fullscreen‘In suburbs that delivery driver thing is a broken model,’ says Manna Aero’s founder, Bobby Healy.Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The GuardianAmazon is operating in Texas, Arizona and Italy, and is seeking permission to fly drones from warehouses in England, whileWing is already operating in several countries. Yet Manna Aero appears to be right in the mix. It has flown 200,000 delivery flights in the Dublin suburb of Blanchardstown, as well as in Helsinki, Finland. Deals with Just Eat and DoorDash could help as it to expand and attract businesses ranging from restaurants, tool stores and bookshops.On Manna’s app the Guardian orders two coffees to be delivered to a borrowed house. A speck on the horizon gradually resolves itself into a quadcopter as it skims over the Dublin suburban skyline. It approaches the garden, hovers momentarily, and then drops the paper bag on a biodegradable string. The drone flies off, leaving two warm, unspilled coffees.The coffees arrived 16 minutes after we put in the order on the app, including time for preparation. That compares with preparation time plus a minimum of 11 minutes for someone delivering the same on an e-bike.Crucially though, the drones do not need to lug around a human, meaning they use less energy, Healy says. Each aircraft does about 80 deliveries a day, he says – well over double what a delivery driver or rider would generally do. On top of that, a drone “pilot” is able to oversee up to 20 aircraft at once, Healy adds.View image in fullscreenAutonomous drones mean fewer people are needed. The ‘pilot’ is able to oversee up to 20 aircraft at once, says Manna’s CEO.Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The GuardianAutonomous dronesThe drones are autonomous from the point that they are loaded and given the OK to lift off from the base. Six minutes later, on average, the drones arrive at the house, and hover above the garden. The only intervention from a pilot is when a video flicks on back at the base to check whether the ground is clear of people or cars.“In suburbs that delivery driver thing is a broken model,” says Healy. “There’s no way you can get a delivery driver to do that and make it profitable.”Healy, a Dubliner, describes himself as a “tech guy”. He left school at 17 to make video games and then started and sold six businesses, most recently CarTrawler, which operates vehicle rental services for airline websites. He founded Manna in 2018 because he wanted to make “measurable impact planet-wide”, bringing coders with him to take on the challenge of creating autonomous drones.The drones were designed by Manna’s teams in Monmouth, Wales, and Dublin, with aerospace-grade parts made mostly in China. Each one weighs 23kg (51lb), including up to 4kg of cargo, a weight that will allow them to fly in the US.View image in fullscreenManna’s drones can carry cargo weighing up to 4kg, enough to carry four 15-inch pizzas.Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The GuardianThat is easily enough to carry four 15-inch pizzas for a family, or transport several books, although “volume is harder than weight”. One delivery of 24 toilet rolls in Finland had to be halved because they would not all fit. “Must have been an emergency,” says Healy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is also an inbuilt parachute, although that has only been used once in 200,000 flights over four years, and European aerospace regulators have audited the company’s tech.The drones operate from bases squeezed in bits of land that can fit a couple of shipping containers and five 2 metre squaredlanding zones. Manna employees in the containers prepare the orders, charge the batteries, which are swapped out after each flight, and oversee the drops in a 2.1-mile (3.4km) circle.Expansion plansManna’s catchment area covers 150,000 people in Blanchardstown. By the end of the year, the company expects to cover about a million people across Dublin. That would be most of the city outside the centre, where shorter distances and fewer private gardens for drops rule out Manna for now. (City centre rooftop deliveries hold promise, but the idea of deliveries to flats on the fourth floor seems unlikely, Healy says.) By the end of the year Healy hopes to be at a rate of 2m flights annually.View image in fullscreenManna has flown 200,000 delivery flights in the Dublin suburb of Blanchardstown and in Helsinki, Finland.Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The GuardianHealy says the UK launch has beenheld up by regulation, although the adoption of EU drone standards on 1 April could open the door as soon as this year, or “definitely” 2026. Customers in Ireland pay a €1.99 (£1.73) delivery fee, but Healy pledges that deliveries will be free for users when the service starts in unnamed UK cities. Businesses will instead pay a commission.Manna still has a lot of obstacles ahead. Each flight is profitable now, but the cost of expansion will still be high for the loss-making company. It has done everything so far on a shoestring €60m in venture capital money, with Coca-Cola and Patrick Collison, the founder of the fintech firm Stripe, on board as investors.Healy also knows that some people will balk at the idea of instant retail gratification. Birds know to keep away, but the company may in the future have to solve the problem of avoiding rival operators’ aircraft.Yet Healy is ebullient about the future of drone deliveries.“It will enable a totally different form of commerce to what we have today,” he says. “People in small businesses beating the giants. If you can move everything in three minutes then you have an Amazon slayer.”Explore more on these topicsDrones (non-military)IrelandCouriers/delivery industryTechnology startupsTechnology sectorRetail industryEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is the last thing he does before bed and the first thing he reaches for in the morning.We have a toddler and are pretty good at sharing childcare, but the minute I appear after work he gets his iPad out. It grates on me more than I can say (especially if we are eating dinner that I’ve cooked). I get that parenting can be lonely and tedious and that he likes to unwind at the end of the day, but I want us to spend time together as a family.I know I can’t possibly be as sexy and fun as a device that’s been engineered by lots of richSiliconValley experts, but I try so hard not to be on my phone the whole time I’m with our kid, as I don’t want the kid to thinkthe phone is more important than hanging out with him. I thought we were on the same page on this, but my partner doesn’t seem to see the dissonance between “our kid doesn’t get an iPad” and “I’ll be on mine the entire time”.Strangers mock my moves. How can I regain confidence on the dancefloor? | Leading questionsRead moreI’m feeling resentment building up and I don’t know how to address it. I love him and think he is kind and fun and hilarious. I miss having a relationship in which there isn’t an iPad.On the rare occasions we’ve managed to have a date night since the baby, he did spend time with me and didn’t go on his phone. It was amazing and I want more of this in our everyday life. I want to set some boundaries, but there’s never a good time to ask as there is never a night when we are not tired. How can I ask for one screen-free night together a week?Eleanor says:I’m hearing lots of different things here. There’s the way the screen use disrupts connection with you. There’s the worry that it’s affecting your child. There’s the feeling that you pick up the household work when he falls into the iPad vortex. Then there’s the meta problem that there’s never a good time to talk about it, though he might not know how you feel about this unless you tell him.So even though it seems like there’s one issue – the screen – each of these might need different remedies.It’s so easy to think that once we go “no screens” the rest will come rushing back. Push the iPad away and there’ll be a lovely new gap in our time that the old hobbies and social connections will fill.But part of the problem with screens is that the more we use them, the more we forget or abandon the other stuff. It can feel like nothing else is waiting for us when we put them down. This can become self-fulfilling: as the hobbies and connections atrophy, non-screen life grows isolating and boring, we turn back to the phone to escape those feelings, and hey presto – time alone on a screen is both the comfort for and the cause of the problem.I wonder whether the opposite of screen immersion isn’t no screens but a life outside that makes screens seem boring.It might help to suggest some active alternatives in each of the parts of life you mentioned. Not just a night for the two of you without phones, but a night to do something specific – a game you’ve wanted to play, an outing you’ve wanted to take, even a movie as long as you’re watching it together. Not just, “Can you watch our kid without the iPad”, but “Is there some activity or memory you want to make sure you have together while he’s this age?”At the extreme edges of screen use, even traditionally recreational things such as this – going on date night, watching a whole movie, reading a book to your kid – can feel like taxing burdens on your attention. Oh, now I have to have a whole idea for how to spend my time, and then I have to pay attention to it? Can’t I just “unwind”? But glazed-eyed scrolling isn’t actually recreation. It doesn’t recharge us. It doesn’t feel good.I’m a mum who feels like the most boring fool on Earth. How do I find ‘interesting me’ again? | Leading questionsRead moreGiven you said he doesn’t use his phone on date nights, it doesn’t sound as though he’s reached that stage. If he has, I think it could only help to know how much you miss him and love spending time with him – just him, even when he’s tired and stressed. It’s so clear how much you like him.Asking him to turn away from the screen a bit doesn’t need to feel as though you’re giving him homework. You’re just asking him because you love spending time with him, even when he feels as though he’s got nothing in the tank. That might be the first part of the reminder that he’s got connections outside the screen. Tell him, and it could feel like something good to return to.The reader’s letter has been edited for lengthAsk Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsFamilyLeading questionsRelationshipsParents and parentingAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Before I knew it the sun had long since set and my lounge was lit only by my Steam Deck and a game that had fast become my new obsession. It is the sort of game that feels as though it were made just for you – and the elements that make it truly special are best discovered without forewarning, so forgive any vagueness in what follows.In a similar style toWhat Remains of Edith FinchorGone Home, Blue Prince has you exploring your character’s atmospherically uninhabited family home. But as inOuter Wilds, your exploration is limited: you are frequently forced to start afresh with little more than the snippets of knowledge you’ve gained. Each expedition is further complicated by Rogue-like randomisation: the house’s shapeshifting floor plan is a five-by-nine grid to be filled anew each day with tiles drafted by you, a feature that some players may recognise from the board game Betrayal at House on the Hill. But in this case there’s a random choice of three options whenever you open a door.View image in fullscreenIt’s always worth trying a room you haven’t seen before.Photograph: Raw FuryDifferent rooms serve different functions. Some provide resources such as keys, money, energy or gems (required to draft more interesting rooms), and these are occasionally locked behind relatively simple standalone puzzles. Others deplete your stocks, like the gymnasium that wearies you each time you enter. A few, such as the boiler room or utility closet, offer special features that affect the rest of the house, occasionally even beyond just that day. On every in-game day, you enter the house, draft rooms, and explore until you run out of energy or openable doors. Rinse and repeat.The point? Ostensibly, to fulfil the stipulation laid out in a deceased great uncle’s will to find an elusive 46th room and thereby inherit the estate. But like a parfait dessert, this game is deliciously layered. At first the sprawling house can feel sparse, with its lifeless rooms and the game’s calming cel-shaded art style and succinct sound design and music. You’ll focus on the draft, learning as you go that the further you get from the entrance, the more likely you are to draw rarer rooms; that most rooms can only be drafted once per run; and that it’s always worth trying a room you haven’t seen before even if it doesn’t seem useful in the moment.Before too long, you’ll start to find objects that hint at future discoveries: car keys when you’ve yet to see a car (or even considered venturing outside); notes written by different hands; larger puzzles you have no idea how or why to solve. You’ll scribble down hints and set goals for future runs, or – as I did – take copious screenshots of the letters, photographs and other artefacts found throughout. As the rooms become more familiar, you’ll notice more details and wonder if they’re background art, environmental storytelling, or clues.In another game such repetition could feel tedious, but Blue Prince sets a gently rewarding pace, the randomisation nudging you to try new things and make new discoveries each day. Thoughtful design details smooth your way: most locked doors only require any generic key, the more convoluted puzzles remain solved even when the house resets, the use of discrete energy units consumed when you enter a room – rather than a ticking clock – means you can always take your time. I never felt in danger of not being able to solve a problem, and multiple puzzles ended up having easier solutions than I initially suspected.And then there’s the fact that Blue Prince has the best titular homophone in video games (sorry Fortnite). It’s a game about the blueprints of the Mount Holly Estate, and naturally a magical mansion like this has a story; it’s this, the family behind it, and the fantastical wider world in which they live, that will draw you to the 46th room and far, far beyond.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From the slam-dunking shenanigans of NBA Street to Mario Strikers’ show-stopping absurdity, once serious competitions were reimagined as wonderfully silly grudge matches. Yet as the live service era arrived, sport sims became less about pulse-pumping plays, and more about collecting increasingly expensive virtual trading cards.Enter Rematch, a refreshingly action-packed reimagining of the beautiful game. Channelling the scrappy thrills of Powerleague five-a-side, Rematch sidelines Fifa’s team-focused tactics to put you in the studded boots of a single player. With controls like a third-person action game, developer Sloclap channels its martial arts-heavy experience with previous titles Sifu and Absolver into creating weighty, skill-driven football. It’s wonderfully agile, fast and furious stuff. Passes are delivered manually, shots are curled in the heat of the moment, and goalies come sprinting down the halfway line like an Oliver Kahn possessed. Gratuitous slide tackles and bicycle kicks are the order of the day, and as my teammates and I score our respective half-line screamers, I can’t stop grinning.“Fifa is a football simulation and Rematch is a football player simulation,” says creative director, Pierre Tarno. “In gaming this kind of pass to volley kick action simply does not exist any more. So, we thought: ‘Let’s make it happen!’”View image in fullscreenReflex-testing … Rematch.Photograph: SloclapWhere Sifu had you knocking seven shades of chi out of a slew of martial arts masters, Rematch channels similarly reflex-testing gameplay into a kickabout. Thanks to the high level of player control, matches get surprisingly sweaty surprisingly quickly. Without 10 other controllable players to consider, Rematch is a game of constant movement. Sprinting costs precious stamina, and holding the “run” button constantly à la Fifa is a swift way to fumble your shot. Thankfully, you’ve got a trick hidden under your knee pads. A tap of the bumper lets off a sudden, swift burst of speed. Tied to a separate meter, this emergency boost is great for chasing down the striker in your box or for ditching that defender snapping at your heels. Soon you’re balancing midfield and defensive play on the fly and charging into goalmouth scrambles in authentically scrappy fashion.Sporting an art style that’s part Breath of the Wild, part French impressionism, anime-esque speed lines follow your player as you sprint across each lusciously rendered pitch. Scoring a goal warps the virtual environment around you, the stage’s backdrop transforming Smash Bros-style, to match the leading team’s home stadium, as the ball hits the back of the net in an explosion of colour.According to Tarno, Rematch’s visuals were an attempt to recreate the look of soft dreamy paintings inside immersive 3D stadiums. Yet despite its endearingly cartoony look, there’s a welcome lack of screen-filling super moves and gravity defying feats. “We once had wall-running built into the game,” he says, “but it was a little too far from the credible football fantasy that we were aiming for.”View image in fullscreenA game of constant movement … Rematch.Photograph: SloclapThis is a world that’s bright in aesthetic and outlook. Set in 2065, instead of taking place inside video games’ usual grimdark dystopia, Sloclap offers a refreshingly optimistic view of the future, the environments focused on renewable energies and natural landscapes. One stadium is encased in a dam that generates hydraulic power, another sees your match unfolding nestled under a hillside with spinning wind turbines.“We wanted to dream up a world in which mankind has made the right choices, in which cooperation and resilience are shared values, on and off the pitch,” says Tarno. “It’s really about the joy of playing with friends.”Once the controls finally click, I am fully invested in my ramshackle team. Just like Sloclap’s previous output, Rematch is about mastery, a game where your avatar starts off at the height of their powers – it’s just up to you to figure out how best to wield them. It helps that in Rematch’s world, offsides, fouls and – mercifully – VAR are a thing of the past, with futuristic footie letting nothing slow the action. “I think players who aren’t fans of football will be surprised that they can still enjoy a football game, because it’s intense and dynamic,” says Tarno.As Rematch is online-only, a ball call system lets players raise their hand as they shout and request the ball, with players also able to track the position of the ball – and their teammates – on an FPS-style minimap. There’s more than a touch of Overwatch to Rematch’s futuristic footie. The squad-led approach and precise manual aiming mean it feels just as satisfying to set up a goal as it does to score one. Rematch also shares a sense of arcade kinship with Rocket League – yet where Psyonix’s unstoppable hit sees players launching their Hot Wheels-esque vehicles into comically large footballs, Rematch delivers a more plausible approximation of the game.Rematch is filled with fun player customisation, allowing you to design everything from home and away kits to picking your avatar’s piercings. In keeping with its more inclusive vision of the future, there’s a vitiligo selector and even options for customisable prostheses for your player. Rematch will be a paid release, and I’m told that around half of cosmetic items will be unlockable through play, with additional items sold via in-game currency.Regardless of price point, Tarno is acutely aware that only one thing truly matters. “There’s no secret formula to game development,” he says. “The only way to make a commercial success is to make a very good game. It’s truer in games than any other entertainment industry … gamers are a very discerning audience. They are often very analytical, very precise in their assessment of mechanics and what works and what doesn’t … If the game is not good enough, it simply won’t succeed.”This month’s open beta will be crucial to fine-tuning Rematch. So far at least, it’s been a promising first half. I came into my demo expecting Mario Strikers-esque throwaway fun, and left with sweat-drenched hands. Sloclap’s mission is to bring a sense of fun back into virtual football, and based on what I’ve seen bandied about this colourful pitch so far, Rematch has the depth to make it to the big leagues.Rematch is released on PC, PS5 andXboxin summer 2025Explore more on these topicsGamesPCXboxfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If your child is using their smartphone at school, they are very likely to be breaking the rules. That is the conclusion ofa new report from the Children’s Commissioner, Rachel de Souza, which says that 90% of secondaries and almost 100% of primaries in England have policies in place limiting use of mobile phones in school hours, with many of them requiring children to leave their devices at home or hand them over when they arrive.Those figures, the most robust evidence yet on how schools handle the issue, might be seen as part of a broader pattern: where once there was little but resignation to the ubiquity of smartphones, there are growing signs of a fightback. Today’s newsletter is about the evidence of a shift in how we treat smartphones in childhood – and how it happened much more gradually than it might appear. Here are the headlines.Five big storiesTrump tariffs| After their initial rally in response to Donald Trump’s shock retreat on tariffs,US stocks fell again on Thursday. The sell-off deepened after a White House clarification noted that total tariffs on China had been raised by 145% since Trump took office.Women’s health| More than a quarter of women in England are living with a serious reproductive health issue,according to the largest survey of its kind, and experts say “systemic, operational, structural and cultural issues” prevent women from accessing care.UK Politics| Nigel Farage hasrebuffed a suggestion from Kemi Badenochthat Conservative and Reform UK councillors could form coalitions in town halls after the local elections. The Reform leader said his party had “no intention” of forming coalitions with the Tories at any level after 1 May.US news| A helicoptercrashed into the Hudson River in New Yorkon Thursday, killing all six people onboard, including the pilot and a family of Spanish tourists with three children. The sightseeing helicopter broke apart in midair and crashed upside down into the Hudson River.Peerages| Michael Gove is among those to be awarded a peeragein Rishi Sunak’s resignation honours list. The veteran Conservative politician and editor of the Spectator, who retired as an MP at the last election, is understood to be on the list due to be published as soon as Friday.In depth: A dramatic shift that has been years in the makingView image in fullscreenParents and children worry about amounts of screen time.Photograph: imageBROKER.com/AlamyNot very long ago, the idea of parting children and younger teenagers from their smartphones would have seemed improbable. Parents have worried for years that the little black boxes in their kids’ hands are intensifying the existing pressures of adolescence, damaging attention spans, and exposing them to content meant for adults – but the general reaction used to be a helpless shrug.The research is mixed, with some experts viewing smartphones as a serious problem, and others saying that there is not enough evidence to support a ban. But whatever your view, the issue stands as a classic collective action problem: parents might prefer to get rid of the smartphone, or place strict limits on its use, but worry that enforcing that kind of rule if others don’t will mean their child is left out (and might therefore break it anyway). And so nothing changes.Until … it does. You can see it happening everywhere: the massive attention for Netflix’s miniseries Adolescence, the grassroots group Smartphone Free Childhoodgetting 124,000 parents of children in 13,000 schoolsto sign a pact to delay access until the end of year 9 (13-14 years old),polls showingstrong support for banning social media for under 15s, and the development of a more robust evidence base on the status quo, like the Children’s Commissioner’s report. And while it might seem like the shift has been sudden, the truth is that this is a potential overnight success that has been years in the making.What’s changed?As smartphones have become commonplace and the amount of time that young people spend with screens has increased, so has concern among parents and kids themselves. The Children’s Commissioner’s report says that almost half of children spend more than two hours a day online, with almost a quarter spending more than four hours. More than two in five 16- and 17-year-olds think that their screentime is too high, but 50% of teenagersfeel anxious when they don’t have their phones; a majority of parents now support a smartphone ban for under-16s, with58% in favour last year.As the report suggests, the vast majority of schools have policies in place banning phones for at least part of the school day – and that might be seen as an indication that less is changing than it necessarily appears. The last government was reluctant to make bans a statutory requirement, arguing that headteachers were best placed to decide what would work in their schools, and Labourdeclined to supporta private member’s bill making a ban law last month, leading to the proposals being watered down.Labour are now in a slightly complicated position: education secretary Bridget Phillipson has promised to review whether the guidance is working, but still says that no legal change is necessary. That position is supported by De Souza – who says that the most important thing is that parents get behind their school.But there are signs that the mood is changing. The Conservatives now back a legal change, with shadow education secretary Laura Trott calling the move a “no-brainer”. Last year, Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said that even guidance for headteachers was “a distraction from the many problems facing education”. But in response to the new report, he said: “My personal view is I would support a statutory ban on mobile phones in schools.”How has that happened?Partly, the growing concern is a response to a growing problem: over the long term, more kids are spending longer on their phones, and so it’s natural that more parents are worried.But it’s also true that there evidence has pointed to almost ubiquitous use of smartphones by teenagers, and a lot of younger children, for at least five years – and the evidence of harm hasn’t really shifted.One reason that the response might have changed is a growing number of news stories that have garnered widespread attention, and given parents a sense that a shift might be possible. The campaigning of Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly took her own life in 2017 after viewing harmful content online, has been a key factor in putting pressure on successive governments; so too has the work of Esther Ghey, whose daughter Brianna was murdered.While plenty of petitions have got signatures online before, the emergence of Smartphone Free Childhood feels like a significant development, because it has gained the critical mass to accumulate those voices in one place, with a clear agenda. The group is one answer to De Souza’s call for parental action: they are asking parents to sign up to get rid of smartphones entirely until at least age 14.Could this be a tipping point?While Smartphone Free Childhood have signatories from parents in more than a third of British schools, the more important point is about securing solid majorities of support in specific places: there’s not much point in a handful of parents agreeing at your kid’s school if nobody else there is interested, after all. With that in mind, the move by headteachers of more than 30 primaries in St Albans to declare their schools smartphone-free may be a significant test case for wider adoption.Jonathan Haidt, the author of a widely discussed recent US book calling for new restrictions, The Anxious Generation, often talks about reaching a “global tipping point”, where a shift that once looks impossible now has momentum. In December,he described 2024as “the year the phone-based childhood began to reverse”.Even if 58% of parents in the UK would like smartphones to be banned for their children, it is likely that a smaller proportion are heavily engaged in the subject. So how has the active minority had such an impact?One explanation is in research published a few years ago by the social scientist Damon Centola, who found in a series of experiments that a group of about 25% are suddenly able to build consensus around their view when even slightly smaller numbers fail. “Approaching that tipping point is slow going,” Centolasaid in 2018. “But once you get over it, you’ll see a really large-scale impact.”Is there anything that might slow the momentum?Absolutely. The biggest question over the moves towards smartphone bans, whether in schools or for children more generally, is the evidence base behind it. Jonathan Haidt’s book has been highly controversial, with other experts like Oxford academic psychologist Lucy Foulkesarguing thatthe link between smartphones and a reported rise in teenage mental health problems is more complicated than he suggests.A major study from the University of Birmingham published in February found that smartphone bans on their own do little to improve academic grades or children’s wellbeing. And Sonia Livingstone, who leads the LSE’s research centre for children’s digital rights,argues thatthe benefits and harms of smartphones are more finely balanced than the usual terms of the debate allow.Meanwhile, a statutory ban on phones in schools might have limited impact for the reasons that successive governments have cited: it wouldn’t make much practical difference in the many schools that already have them, and it can’t do much to make it easier for teachers to enforce.Even so, there is little doubt that the discourse has shifted profoundly. In the past, Haidt said last year, resigned parents argued that “You can’t put toothpaste back in a tube, can you?” Today, it may be the parents themselves who are the toothpaste.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The fastest and most relentless of them all is Sherelle, the 31-year-old Londoner. She’s like the bus from Speed, always keeping above 140bpm (and generally about 160) with steely determination as she swerves between footwork, jungle and garage. This surprise-released debut album is a sophisticated production, and positively postmodern in how it unites strands across continents, history, genre and sound sources. With her socially conscious projects that spread access and opportunity, Sherelle is building the future she’d like to see. Her music is charged with the same sense of determination.Ben Beaumont-ThomasTVBlack Mirror season seven | ★★★★☆In this latest season of his collection of digital-age fables, Black Mirror writer Charlie Brooker finally cracks and, for the first time, produces a sequel to an old episode. This year’s feature-length finale, USS Callister: Into Infinity, is a straight continuation of season four’s fan favourite. But it’s the least interesting instalment from the new batch, because it can’t replicate the thrill, the hope, of starting without knowing whether this latest adventure will be a success. The other five offerings take that risk, and almost all get their reward. Anthologies are a hard gig. But this warmer, more convincingly human Black Mirror is easier than ever to forgive.Jack SealeFilmOne to One: John and Yoko | ★★★★☆Film-maker Kevin Macdonald has created a fever dream of pop culture: a TV-clip collage of John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s time in New York in the early 70s, as they led the countercultural protest. It’s a film that mixes small screen zeitgeist fragments and madeleine moments, a memory quilt of a certain time and place. In some ways, this is like David Leaf and John Scheinfeld’s The US vs John Lennon, which covers some of the same ground, but Macdonald’s film is more immersive, more dreamlike. It’s a vivid time capsule.Peter BradshawToday in FocusView image in fullscreenParamedics move the bodies of Palestinian first responders who were killed in Israeli military fire on ambulances, in Khan Younis in Gaza on 30 March 2025Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesHow phone footage exposed a massacre of Gaza paramedicsIsraeli forces killed 15 Palestinian paramedics and civil defence workers in southern Gaza on 23 March.Bethan McKernan reportson the emerging evidence of what happenedThe UpsideA bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all badView image in fullscreenClockwise from top left: Iona Gamble, Katie Piper, Sinéad Burke, Kelly Knox and Marsha de CordovaComposite: Guardian Design;Suki Dhanda for The Observer;Tommy London/Alamy;Jordan Pettitt;Jane Barlow/PA;Getty ImagesIn thisexclusive extractfrom Frances Ryan’s brilliant new book, Who Wants Normal?, she spoke to other influential disabled women about how to live your best life.

All the crises around the world that we’ve no time to fixJonathan FreedlandThe US president adores the attention, but while leaders struggle to mitigate the damage he causes, other emergencies are getting worseFri 11 Apr 2025 11.50 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 13.53 EDTShareWe’re all having to master a vocabulary that was once the preserve of specialists. Now everyone needs to know their tariffs from their treasuries, their levies from their yields. But there’s one more term from the realm of economics that urgently needs to enter our lexicon. Given whatDonald Trumpis doing to the world economy – and the world – we need to talk about opportunity cost.Put simply, opportunity cost is the value of opportunity lost. It’s the benefit you could have had if you had chosen a different path. For an economist, the opportunity cost of the Mars bar you bought is the Twix you didn’t.But the principle extends beyond money. It applies to time, too. The hour you spent scrolling on your phone cost you the hour you could have had walking in the park. It can apply to anything, including our energy and attention.Enter Trump. For weeks, the resources of governments and businesses around the world have been focused squarely on the White House and its whipsawing, on-again-off-again series of tariffs imposed on enemies and friends alike.Last week, it was Trump asgameshow hostin the White House Rose Garden, proudly unveiling his Price is Right table of import duties, listing each country alongside the percentage by which it was about to get whacked. He called it “liberation day”. This week, it wasthe 90-day “pause”– climbdown would be another word – for everywhere except China, which got hit with extra levies. Throughout, people inevery ministry and trading floor on the planet held their breath, along with the boardroom of every company that buys or sells overseas, as they watched to see what Trump would do next to the global economy currently held hostage in the Oval Office. With a gun to the temple of the world trading system, Trump’s every twitch has commanded humanity’s attention.And, my, how he loves it. You could see his pleasure as he told a Republican dinner on Tuesday that the world’s nations were “kissing my ass” to negotiate a deal that would spare them tariff pain. For him, the uncertainty is all part of the fun. As the Economistrightly observed, he relishes “being the focus of a planetary guessing game”. Trump used to get his dopamine hit from a mention in the gossip columns of the New York tabloids; now he’s tasted the thrill of commanding an audience in the billions and he’s hooked.But consider the price we are all paying. I don’t (only) mean those trillions of dollars wiped out at a stroke through tumbling stocks, or even the investments put on hold as businesses decide that, amid all this uncertainty, now is not the right time to open that new factory or launch that new product, thereby delaying, perhaps for ever, the jobs or wages that would have found their way to people who need them.I mean instead the opportunity cost: the action the world could be taking if it were not forced to monitor, adjust to and accommodate the whims of one man, whose ideas on economics were formed five decades ago and werewrong even then.Right now, all the capacity governments have is devoted either to saving or replacing a global trading system that was, however imperfectly, functioning. Huge intellectual and political energy is, and will be, dedicated to ensuring that national economies can survive now that that system has been upended and a previously indispensable trading partner has gone off the rails.There are already some strong ideas. Gordon Brown has called for an “economic coalition of the willing” that would mobilise the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to protect the poorest nations and coordinate action on both interest rates and credit for companies in trouble. That approach fits with thesuggestionthat the likes of Japan, Canada, South Korea and Australia join forces with Britain and the EU to form a free trade alliance minus the US.I would embrace both those developments. But just think where all that collective energy could be going if it were not having to confront a crisis started so needlessly by Trump. Those same powers would be free to act together to tackle the climate emergency, to name the most obvious example. Europe has just experienced itswarmest ever March, 1.6C hotter than pre-industrial levels, while figures released this week show that Arctic sea ice reached its lowest extent for March since satellite records began.Naturally, no one expects Donald “Drill, baby, drill” Trump to care about that, not when he actively wants to see the world burning more, not fewer, fossil fuels. But much of the rest of the world does care about the climate crisis. Of course, it would be naive to imagine that, absent Trump, they would be devoting every waking hour to reducing carbon emissions. But what little capacity the international system has for collective action has been gobbled up by a crisis that was not born of natural disaster or pandemic, but the caprice and vanity of one man.Witness the plight of Sudan. Figures are hard to come by, but a monitoring lab at Yale puts the number of dead in the civil war that has raged there since 2023 as high as150,000, with the UN accusing both sides of “harrowing” crimes, including mass rape and torture. International action is essential. Instead, say campaigners, there’s been a “loss of leadership, coordination and money”, traceable to the day Trump took office.Part of that is down to Elon Musk’s dismantling of the lead US aid agency, but part of it is other governments having their hands full managing the Trump hurricane. As Kate Ferguson of Protection Approaches told me, the gutting of USAid and “the anxiety triggered by tariffs” mean US funding to on-the-ground emergency response rooms – health clinics and the like – has collapsed, “and other states are hesitant to fill the gap”. Next week there’s a chance to put that right, as foreign ministersgather in Londonon Tuesday to discuss Sudan. But it’s hard to be hopeful. David Lammy won early plaudits for highlighting the bloodshed in Sudan, but in recent weeks, the foreign secretary’s focus has necessarily been elsewhere. You can say the same of Gaza or Ukraine, forced down the list of international priorities by a trade war that did not have to happen.This is how it is. Political bandwidth is limited. I’ve been told often that governments can handle only one crisis at a time, two at most. Now a huge chunk of that capacity has had to be diverted to dealing with something that decision-makers could previously take for granted: relations with the US and the functioning of the global trade system. Currently, both are in a state of permanent crisis. Britons have seen this movie before, when Brexit consumed several years of political and policymaking energy, and the entire apparatus of the UK state was forced to deal with an issue that never needed to arise, energy that could have gone on real problems that desperately needed solving.To repeat, Trump will lose no sleep over any of this. He likes the thought that his foes – and even his allies are foes – will be snarled up, trying to untangle knots he’s created: it’s a tactic he’s used since the 1970s, when he liked to tie up opponents in lawsuits. He loves tariffs especially, because they give him the power to exempt countries or even individual companies he favours – those who “kiss his ass” – ina system that all butinvites bribery and corruption. He loves these games. But they cost everyone else dear – until, that is, the rest of the world decides to stop playing.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump tariffsTariffscommentShareReuse this content"

Everything you need to know about early voting, how to enrol, apply for a postal vote, what to do if you are overseas and moreRead moreTrump had his Make America Great Again cap; Dutton’s party has itsAustralia Back on Tracktote.Even staunch Liberals began to flinch from what sounded like a Mar-a-Lago political menu as voters speculated on what a Dutton Doge would do to pensions, jobseeker, ABC, Medicare and Australia’s other beloved supports.Opinion polling by YouGov this week shows thedramatic rupture in support for Duttonearly this year.The findings show Dutton was at his worst-ever net satisfaction rating of -15 at the start of this month, down from -2 in February. This meant 38% of voters were satisfied with him but 53% were not.The director of public data at YouGov, Paul Smith, said the collapse followed “his embrace of controversial Trump-style policies such as banning work-from-home arrangements and proposing to sack 40,000 public sector workers”.“These actions have clearly impacted his public perception, contributing to a significant drop in satisfaction.”The critical comparison is that Anthony Albanese’s satisfaction rating was -6. That was 44% satisfied and 50% not.The popularity decline reflects Dutton’s aggressive personal and public style, as compared with the relative flatness of Albanese. Dutton likes stormy waters. Albanese doesn’t like making waves.At a time of global disruption, voters might be seeking a calm hand on the tiller.Dutton has now realised the US president isn’t a suitable model for Australian politics, no matter what his billionaire acquaintancessuch as Gina Rinehartsay.Australian voters broadly think American politics is nuts at the best of times and menacingly toxic under Trump. Why vote for a wannabe Trump here?In February Dutton read the mood of the national electorate and on the Nine television network’s 60 Minutes he rejected the idea he was impersonating the US president.“Well, that might be a Labor line but it’s just not true,” he said.“I grew up under John Howard’s wing. I worked closely with Peter Costello as assistant treasurer, so I think that’s more my role model than others around the world.”It didn’t help that also in February, on Nine’s Today program, Liberal frontbencher Michaelia Cash pumped up the Trump likeness: “The American people, they expect action. And that is what they’re getting.“And they’ll get the exact same attitude under a Peter Dutton government.”But there was much worse to come to dent Dutton authenticity.Dutton tight-lipped over how many voluntary redundancies would be offered in public service cuts planRead moreThe too-frequent alteration of policy on the run has damaged Dutton’s authority over issues, even when they are issues he has raised as priorities.He has had so many pratfalls it is becoming difficult for voters to accept he genuinely believes in the policies involved. There are doubts as to whether he knows what he is doing.The editor-in-chief of the West Australian, Chris Dore, on Friday bluntly put this view in Dutton’s presence:“And frankly, Mr Dutton has, at times, looked a bit punch-drunk since the beginning of the campaign … ”In a muted echo of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” and slash the cost of government, Dutton vowed to reduce the federal public service by 41,000. He just wasn’t sure where or how.When the mechanics of mass firings – and the effect on services – were rejected, the opposition said numbers would be cut through natural attrition – a non-replacement rule.Well, that was a silly idea given Dutton had set a five-year timetable for the reductions. So, on Friday this process was bolstered bya voluntary redundancy program, with no immediate calculationof how much it might cost to pay 41,000 people to quit.“We will cap the size of the Australian public service and we will reduce the numbers back to the levels they were three years ago through natural attrition and voluntary redundancies,” said campaign spokesman James Paterson on ABC Radio National.The most embarrassing policy shuffle has been theill-fated Dutton proposal to ban working from home.It was designed to get public servants back into offices but was understandably identified by many privately employed voters as a blanket prohibition across all employment.2:19Dutton's WFH backflip and Albanese's mental health pledge - TLDR: Election 2025 – videoDutton’s clumsy delivery of this proposal, and his failure to foresee how it would anger many women voters forced him to apologise for his “mistake”.Dutton is now identifying himself as a John Howard Liberal.But the man who was prime minister for 11 years never felt the need to be someone else, and – right or wrong – was master of his policies.Malcolm Farr is a political journalistExplore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025OpinionAustralian politicsPeter DuttonAnthony AlbaneseCoalitionLiberal partyLabor partycommentShareReuse this content"

I suppose boys will be boysFri 11 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 10.20 EDTShareIwould like to dispel some rumors right up front. One, I did not receive a PhD in business from Harvard Business School. Hopefully this doesn’t make you think less of me, but I felt it necessary to be honest. Second, I did not even attend Harvard. I thought about it once; hopefully, thinking about something isn’t illegal yet.My point is that I am no elitist snob begging for your subservience. I’m a simple man, just trying to salvage the last of my meager wealth during the great trade war of 2025. I know absolutely nothing about global economic policy. As such, I must be worth listening to.I say all of this because Elon Musk, the owner of various companies such as Tesla, SpaceX,Weyland-Yutani,OCP,the Tyrell Corporation, etc, has made it abundantly clear that he can’t stand Peter Navarro.Peter Navarro, with his fancy degree from Harvard, is too much of an intellectual for the current zeitgeist that favors a complete lack of knowledge for just about anyone in a position of authority. The secretary of education never taught a single school class, butshe has (poorly) received a Stone Cold Stunner.The secretary of health and human serviceshas a problem with pasteurized milk. The secretary of transportationwas on Road Rules, so at least he has a basic understanding of motorway etiquette. But for the most part, if you have only a layman’s understanding of your role, you are unequivocally qualified to lead.I am ill-suited to any cabinet position, unless there’s a secretary of cocktails, in which case, I make a mean dry gin martini with a twist of lemon. So I am paradoxically the perfect person to run our economic policy, based on the rhetoric of Elon Musk, who deemed Peter Navarro to be a “moron”because of his advanced degree, and his support for Donald Trump’s ruinous tariffs against global trade. Navarro stated that Musk’s Tesla plants area prime example of the world’s trade imbalance. “In many cases, if you go to [Musk’s] Texas plant, a good part of the engines that he gets, which in the EV case are the batteries, come from Japan and come from China. The electronics come from Taiwan,” Navarro alleged.This statement set Musk off, causing him to turn on Navarro – whom he considers “dumber than a sack of bricks” – and by proxy, Trump’s stated aims of bringing manufacturing back to the US through onerous taxation. Musksaid on X: “By any definition whatsoever, Tesla is the most vertically integrated auto manufacturer in America with the highest percentage of US content. Navarro should ask the fake expert he invented, Ron Vara.” The “Ron Vara” comment is in reference to the allegedly made-up expert that Navarrocited in his 2011 bookDeath by China, which warns the reader of nefarious Chinese economic policy. When called out about his charming little fib, Navarro said that the use of a fictional figure that is clearly an anagram of his own last name was a fun “inside joke” between him and … I suppose the basic tenets of ethics.This is the grand thesis of Trump’s America. Personal grievance and retribution are paramountThis is, by any cogent estimation, a battle of the titans: Navarro, the Ivy League-educated garbage man for the current American president, and Musk, who managed to wield his immense wealth to convince said president that having a functioning government wasbeta-ass behavior, bruh. Is there a winner here? Probably not. We all lose when no one seems to care about anything but their own interests. Navarro is terrified to upset his boss. Musk clearly doesn’t want to endanger his own profits by allowing tariffs to squelch the free exchange of goods between nations that like electric cars. The rest of us, the chaff caught between these two gibbering hobbits, can fend for ourselves until they figure it out.This fight is expensive for us. The stock market, which is too esoteric and costly for most average people to participate in directly,shed trillions of dollarsthanks to fears of Trump’s tariffs. That value bounced back after the president backed off his threats for a period of 90 days, but the psychological effect of that brinkmanship will be hard to shake. Those fluctuations are video game-like blips for the mega-rich, but they can cause real harm to the retirement funds of the average citizen. Atariff on pharmaceuticalscould inhibit people from accessing life-saving medication. To people like Navarro and Musk, these are theoretical concerns, so far removed from their everyday lives that they might as well be the problems of the Klingon empire on Star Trek. Why should they care, when their own petty squabbles are so near and dear to them?But this is the grand thesis of Trump’s America. Personal grievance and retribution are paramount. Proving you are superior to your enemy means more than the fate of a stranger, or a neighbor. Why do we get out of bed every morning if not to smite our opponent on the virtual battlefield of social media? It means more tobe rightthan todo right.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We do need some manner of global trade to survive, because the global economy is so bloody complicated and ridiculous that we have to keep some semblance of the status quo for now. That his calculus is related to his own personal wealth is an unfortunate aspect of this position. Navarro, on the other hand, understands Musk shouldn’t be involved in the economic policy of the entire planet. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, referred to this spat as a benign “boys will be boys” dust-up, but I think it’s more than that.This is Godzilla v Kong, if Godzilla was a sycophantic bureaucrat and Kong appeared to havevery expensive hair transplants.In the aforementioned film, Godzilla and Kongbeat the shit out of each other and destroyed an entire city in the process.

Just look at SyriaSimon JenkinsSanctions as a form of economic aggression are macho and myopic, yet countries including the UK refuse to call a haltFri 11 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 10.07 EDTShareAmong the more improbable countries that Donald Trump punished most severely last week was Syria, with a41% tariffin retaliation for its part in the “raping and plundering” of the US economy. That should teach it a lesson for toppling Bashar al-Assad last year.The Damascus regime that subsequently came to power is pleading for help in keeping order and restoring its economy. But the chief obstacle is not Trump’s absurd tariff – now reduced to 10%. It is the sanctions regime imposed on it for the past 14 years by the west, including Britain. The USprohibits nearly all tradeand financial transactions, extending this to foreign companies engaged with the Syrian government. EU sanctions targeted crude oil, investments, banking, telecoms and more. No tariff could be as severe as this.Tariffs are sanctions by another name. It is hypocrisy for Britain and others to criticise Trump for using a tool they have in effect deployed for decades. Sanctions never work as intended. Their purpose is to persuade usually authoritarian regimes to alter their policies or submit to pressure from their internal foes. Evidence of them doing this is all but nonexistent. Sanctions have become mere signals of virtue by western politicians.Syria is a classic case. During the Arab spring of the early 2010s, the British government, led by David Cameron, wanted to intervene militarily inSyria, but intelligence advised him that Assad was about to fall. He thought it better to impose sanctions to hasten the moment.They did the opposite. Sanctions unquestionably hurt Syria’s economy. They played a role in driving six million of its people abroad, including much of its professional class. Every conceivable enemy of Assad fled, and 90% of the population descended into poverty. Assad’s power was consolidated and he turned toRussiafor military aid. He stayed secure for a decade. In the end, it wasn’t sanctions that dealt the final blow to his regime.The one thing the new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, asked for from the west was theswift lifting of sanctionsand help to restore the country’s shattered economy. The west said no. They would remain in place until he showed he could restore stability and national unity. This he has found predictably hard – hardly helped by sanctions – but he enjoys widespread domestic support.In January, the EU and Britain did agree alifting of restrictionson banking transactions, energy and of Syrian travel. But western governments hate lifting sanctions on the principle that they lose a degree of control. No one cares that they have a zero or even negative effect on policy. The presumption is that because they “hurt” they must influence policy, and will work “in time”.In the 21st century, sanctions have replaced gunboat diplomacy as neo-imperial outreach. They keep the rest of the world poorer and supposedly weaker. The US had about900 classes of sanctionsin force in 2000. This year it has more than 15,000. The UK has thousands in an interventionist bureaucracy of staggering complexity. The foreign officecalls them“a powerful foreign and security policy tool”, a claim without a shred of evidence. We might as well call them a tool for entrenching and prolonging dictatorship. The most-sanctioned regimes are among the longest-lasting in modern history, such as North Korea, Iran, China, Russia and Cuba. A sanction is a badge of security.Current economic measures against Russia rank among the most severe and counterproductive perhaps of all time. They were first imposed in 2014 to attempt to reverse Moscow’s policy on Ukraine. Since then, they have toughened almost monthly. Banning contact with Russia has not diminished Vladimir Putin’s domestic support. He might even take comfort from the fact that most western leaders who sanctioned him in 2022 have since lost office.In February,the UK announcedthe “largest sanctions package against Russia since 2022”. It included 107 new orders, with a gleeful mention of “14 new kleptocrats”. Nowhere did it explain how this was supposed to work. The sceptical Economist magazine has chartedthe futility of these measures. Russia’s economic performance “is now in line with its pre-invasion trend: GDP grew in real terms by more than 3% last year. Unemployment remains at a record low. And there is little evidence of corporate distress.” Russia has out-performed Britain ever since this economic war was declared. At least part of the cause has been the soaring price of energy, a self-inflicted wound by the west on a par with Trump’s tariffs.The reason is that the world economy adjusts with extraordinary fluency to new realities, as it will to Trump. Sanctions against Moscow hasn’t meant the end of trade with Russia. Iran’s oil exports have risen 12-fold in the past six years, largely through China’s help. Kazakhstan’s exports to Russia rose from $40m in 2021 to $298m in 2023. More than100 British companiesadmit to breaching sanctions.Western economic aggression has failed even to dent Putin’s policy in Ukraine. Now western leaders, who were happy to punish Syria’s economy when that was the macho thing to do, leave it in the lurch. Syria desperately needs help to find its feet. Adam Smith was right. Free trade should know no barriers. Its benefits are universal.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The president couldn’t ignore the worldwide economic havoc that he had caused singled-handedly – stock markets were plunging, business executives were panicking and consumers were seething.Eager to persuade manufacturers to build new plants in the US, Trump said on Monday that many of his tariffswould be permanent. But for Trump, permanent evidently meant two days.Once again, Trump showed that his second term is one of fiat, flub and flip-flop, of bluster and blunder, of shooting first and aiming later. It’s also a mix of cutting, gutting and cruelty.And foolery. Trump’s tariffs are worse than, as the Wall Street Journal put it, the “dumbest trade war in history”: they are the dumbest economic policy that any US president has ever adopted. His tariffs quickly caused vast and totally unnecessary damage to stock markets, industries and diplomatic relations across the globe. Before Trump unexpectedly suspended the tariffs, US stock markets had lostmore than $10tnin value, and stock markets overseas plummeted, too. Millions of retirees had seen their 401(k)s plunge in value, consumers were facing substantially higher prices and many workers were already losing their jobs as Trump’s tariffs sent shockwaves through the global economy.The Guardian view on the tariff war pause: the Trump trade shambles is not over | EditorialRead moreTrump’s embarrassing climbdown on tariffs was one of the rare times he bowed to common sense. If only he would do the same when it comes to his dangerously myopic cuts to scientific research, environmental protection and foreign aid.Trump has not climbed down, however, in his showdown with China. In a fit of pique over China’s retaliatory tariffs, Trump has imposedstratospheric 145% tariffs on China. Attention Walmart shoppers: that is going to more than double the price of many things you buy.When it came to tariffs, Trump made some basic political fumbles. Not only did he gogolfing and speak at a million-dollar-a-headfundraiser as this economic disaster unfolded, but he failed to give a coherent explanation for his screw-everyone-else tariffs. Trump and his team pointed to a potpourri of often-conflicting goals: to erase trade deficits, to collect trillions of dollars for the treasury, to bring back manufacturing jobs, to give Trump negotiating leverage to crack down on fentanyl and immigration and reduce other countries’ tariffs.Let’s not delude ourselves. There are two main reasons for Trump’s tariffs: first, to satisfy his never-ending thirst for vengeance against those he feels have wronged him (which seems to mean every country in the world except Russia) and second, to fulfill his desire to wield a club over everyone and everything. By using staggeringly high tariffs as a weapon, Trump has been acting like a mob enforcer, telling every business in town: I’m going to clobber you with my baseball bat unless you do what I want.There’s another reason for Trump’s tariffs: his ignorance about how the world’s economy works. Trump’s “liberation day” speech on tariffs gave the looney, but unmistakable, impression that he believes that Vietnam, for instance, is looting and pillaging the US by selling more sneakers and other goods to the US than the US sells to Vietnam. Trump thinks this even though millions of Americans are delighted to buy well-made sneakers from Vietnam (which would cost consumers far more if they were made in the US).With his grievance-driven, zero-sum worldview, Trump no doubt believes that other countries are unfairly taking advantage of the US whenever we trade with them – and he wants to get even.With the nation’s low 4% unemployment rate, it will be hard to find workers to do the manufacturing jobs that Trump wants to bring backTrump thinks that trade deficits are evil. If Trump had taken a class with Robert Solow, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at MIT, he might have heard Solow’s wisdom about why there’s no big worry about bilateral trade deficits: “I have a chronic deficit with my barber, who doesn’t buy a darned thing from me.”That Trump got to impose his calamitous tariffs at 12.01am on Wednesday reflects the dismal quality of his cabinet and advisers. Too many are lackeys who automatically cheer whatever he does, while some others, like the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, no doubt realized that his tariffs were dumb and disastrous, but they’re too cowardly to tell the Tariff King. The tariffs would inevitably increase inflation and probably push the US into recession. Even though Republicans have vowed never to raise taxes, Trump’s tariffs are unarguably a tax, a regressive tax andthe largest tax increase in 60 years. Trump’s tariffs were bound to destroy smoothly running supply chains and hurt untold numbers of US companies. They were also a disaster for relations with our allies. They were already triggering massive retaliation.If Trump had some smart, principled advisers, they might explain to him that many obstacles might prevent his tariffs from achieving their goals. With the nation’s low 4% unemployment rate, it will be hard to find workers to do the manufacturing jobs that Trump wants to bring back, especially when he’s rounding up and expelling many immigrant workers. Moreover, US corporations have largely lost the technological knowhow to compete in various industries and that complicates hopes to bring back far more factories.Then there’s another big problem – the chaotic Trump is the worst possible president to persuade companies to build factories in the US to produce goods they now obtain from abroad. King Donald the Capricious does not exactly exude the air of stability that executives insist on before they decide to make big investment decisions, like building new factories.Trump trumpeted his tariffs in part to show strength, but he ended up in an embarrassing retreat (he did maintain a 10% tariff on many countries). Trump is eager to get China to heed his wishes, but China, the world’s leading manufacturing country, can now see that Trump will back down when the heat is too great.China doesn’t have clean hands on trade. It improperly subsidizes many industries to help them outcompete manufacturers in the US and elsewhere. China also has ambitions to vastly increase its manufacturing capacity – a strategy that could kill off important industries in the US, Canada, Europe, Japan and other countries. If Trump were smart and strategic, he – instead of alienating those countries with his tariffs – would have formed an alliance with those countries to pressure China. But now those countries are too angry at the Trump to do that.Trump, never one to admit defeat, insists that his climbdown was a victory, that the mess he made was marvelous strategy. He says many countries are eager to make deals with him. “I’m telling you, these countries are calling us up,kissing my ass,” he said on Wednesday. “They are dying to make a deal.”Our allies are no doubt furious with Trump. Not only were they already angry that he stabbed Ukraine in the back and sidled up to Putin, but they’re unhappy that his tariff foolishness violated numerous international agreements and sought to blow up a smoothly running trade system. And then Trump ridicules them by saying they were rushing to kiss his behind.I hardly ever agree with Elon Musk, but he was right that Trump’s tariffswere the work of moronswho were “dumber than a sack of bricks”.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issues.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionDonald TrumpTariffsTrump administrationUS economyUS foreign policyUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

While no official total tally of“Hands Off!”participants is yet available, the anti-Donald Trump, anti-Elon Musk actions on Saturday were certainly among the largest single-day protests in US history, with rallies in all 50 states.As we seem to be entering a new stage of popular protest movements, it’s worth assessing the strategic value of protest, as well as the limits and potential liabilities. History is full of powerful examples of consequential bottom-up protest movements. The women’s suffrage movement secured voting rights after decades of struggle. The civil rights movement dismantled Jim Crow segregation. The labor movement won the eight-hour workday, the weekend and much more.Protestwas an essential tool for each of these movements. It can take many different forms, including mass demonstrations, boycotts, strikes, unruly disruption and civil disobedience.Protest is often negatively framed as naive, utopian or merely self-expressive. But it can be profoundly pragmatic. When part of a larger power-building strategy, protest can play an essential role in forcing issues onto the public agenda, changing popular opinion, delegitimizing powerholders, shifting the balance of forces and even toppling regimes. Protest movements don’t always win, of course, but history is full of stories of “Davids” defeating “Goliaths”.I’m a Jewish Israeli in the US standing up for Palestine. By Trump’s logic, I’m a terror supporter | Eran ZelnikRead moreOnly weeks into Trump’s second term, as we seek to limit the damage and, ultimately, to defeat authoritarianism and oligarchy, protest is as necessary and important as ever. How can we make our voices as powerful as possible?How Trump frames protestersProtest is also rife with peril. When powerful people and institutions feel threatened, they tend to fight dirty, using every tool at their disposal, including police and legal repression. In addition to facing threats to safety and freedom, social movement participants are characteristically slandered and stereotyped by their opponents, with slanted news coverage often parroting the messages or sharing the assumptions of the ruling class.Before exploring some pitfalls of protest (and how to avoid them), let’s get a few things clear. First, it is brave and worthy to engage in protest for just causes, against powerful actors; not only that, it’s necessary if we want to have a democracy. Second, our opponents have a vested interest in disparaging and caricaturing our protests and they will attempt to slander us no matter what we do (but this doesn’t mean we have no ability to counter their attacks). Third, peril and pitfalls cannot be completely avoided: a protest where everything goes perfectly is rare, and the likelihood of errors and excesses is a poor excuse for inaction.A central constraint today is the dominant narrative about protest itselfThat said, organizers of protests do have a responsibility to do everything in our power to ensure that collective action is as effective as possible. The sociologist Max Weber argued that those who seek to intervene in politics have a responsibility not only for our own intentions, but also for the counter-responses to our actions. In other words, we have a responsibility to think a few chess moves ahead and to craft a strategy that can win.A central constraint today is the dominant narrative about protest itself. In the US, this narrative casts protesters as a specialtypeof person, with some combination of the following features: loud, shrill, naive, counter-cultural, speaking in jargon, Marxist, anti-American, violent and economically and/or educationally privileged (AKA “elitist”). The purpose of this dominant narrative is straightforward: inoculate millions of Americans against protest movements by otherizing “protesters”. In other words, there’s a well-worn caricature of a protester that holds many everyday working people back from aligning with protest movements.Ultimately it’s on us to get more people to see us differently. To be clear, I’m not talking about our hard opponents. The point of protest is never to be palatable to everyone. I’m talking here about the millions of Americans who have a high potential to join, support or at least sympathize with protest movements.Trump didn’t invent this disparaging story, but he grafts these negative tropes about protest and protesters on to his larger pseudo-populist “anti-elite” narrative. I put “anti-elite” in quotes because Trump strategically namesculturalelites as culprits, intentionally diverting attention away from the concentratedeconomicpower (eg Wall Street, huge corporations and billionaires like Elon Musk) that is actually to blame for the hardships of tens of millions of working-class Americans. Trump’s favorite “elite” targets include academia, the news media, Hollywood and Democratic politicians. “Woke protesters” take their place alongside the rest of this elite cast in Trump’s play. Opposed to these hoity-toity, overeducated, condescending elites, Trump presents himself as hero and champion of “ordinary Americans”.This framing is effective because it taps into a real and deepening class-based cultural divide in America – between a highly educated professional class occupying roughly the top 10-20% of the spectrum, and the bottom 80% below. In his bookDream Hoarders, Richard Reeves lays out how this upper stratum has pulled away from the majority of Americans – not just economically, but socially and culturally. The complex US tax code, legacy college admissions, and housing, zoning and other policies have benefited the already advantaged. As distinct from the ultra-rich “one per cent”, many in this larger upper strata see themselves as progressive, even as they benefit from invisible moats around their neighborhoods, schools and social networks. This deepening class-based insularity creates the cultural disconnect that Trump exploits. He directs populist anger toward these cultural elites, while diverting attention away from far more powerful and destructive economic culprits, offering working-class Americans cultural revenge rather than policies that could make a real positive difference in their lives.View image in fullscreen‘If our opponents are determined to otherize us as unrelatable ‘protesters’, what are the familiar aspects of our identities that we can emphasize instead?’Photograph: Diana Apfelbacher/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockTrump’s exploitationof this cultural-economic backdrop – and Democrats’ failure to even comprehend it, let alone come up with a counter-strategy – was central to his electoral victories in both 2016 and 2024. This same backdrop should also be of great concern to protest movements. We who are attempting to organize people into collective action must recognize how easily our movements can be portrayed as extensions of this privileged class and work intentionally to break out of that framing (and, sometimes, that reality).At Trump rallies during his 2016 campaign, I observed how he would deliberately draw attention to protesters, utilizing them as characters in his story, encouraging the crowd to chant and jeer as security removed the disruptive “outside agitators”.So it was striking to watch how dramatically Trump changed his tack when military veterans spoke out at some of these same rallies. He completely ignored them, refusing to acknowledge their presence, strategically avoiding even looking in their direction. These veterans later learned from active-duty friends that Trump had gotten quite upset by their actions, because they didn’t fit into his narrative; military veterans could easily overcome Trump’s “woke protester” framing.Breaking out of Trump’s playbookIn the first several weeks of Trump’s second term, we again see powerful examples of veterans speaking out, for example,publicly confronting their representativesabout Doge cuts to the benefits they earned. Grassroots organizations of veterans, likeCommon Defense, are helping to prepare, support and amplify the efforts of fellow veterans as they use their powerful voices to speak up in this critical moment. Protagonists in the story of America, veterans bring a unique authority and credibility that is very difficult for their powerful opponents to caricature or disparage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

From park rangers to USPS employees, these workers are protesting threats to their livelihoods and to the valued public services they provide, speaking up as workers about the devastation wrought by Musk’s “chainsaw” on their lives and the communities they serve. Importantly, they represent a cross-section of America: diverse in race, geography, education and political leanings. They are relaying their experiences and connecting with millions of Americans who see themselves in their stories. Using plainspoken language rather than jargon, they present themselves not as “protesters” but as parents, neighbors and workers who have a stake in their country’s future.Politicians want to normalise what’s happening in Gaza. Our moral outrage won’t let that happen | Nesrine MalikRead moreThe lesson isn’t that you have to be a military veteran or federal worker if you want to effectively protest against Trump and Musk. But if our opponents are determined to otherize us as unrelatable “protesters”, what are the familiar aspects of our identities that we can emphasize instead? The story of aworkerwho is so fed up that she decides to join with others in collective action is very different from the dominant story about genericprotesters.It’s important to also grasp and grapple with other elements of Trump’s attack narrative; his use of “protester” tropes is not the only means he uses to otherize and dehumanize. He also attacks vulnerable people because of their immigration status, their advocacy for Palestine and their gender identity, among other pretenses. Each of these attacks warrants its own strategic counter-response and it’s vitally important that we show solidarity and narrate Trump’s targeting ofanyof us as an attack onall of usand on our shared values and rights – as has been on display in the popular outpouring of support for the detained Columbia graduate studentMahmoud Khalil.Another important way today’s protests are breaking out of Trump’s playbook is by consistently punching up, especially at Musk as an unelected billionaire who has taken oligarchy in America to new heights. When we name powerful economic culprits, it takes the wind out of Trump’s fake populist sails. Billionaires who rigged our economy and political system make for a more convincing culprit to millions of Americans than vulnerable scapegoats (eg immigrants, trans people, or “woke”). A central reason we got into this mess is thatDemocrats have been so tepid and inconsistentin picking visible fights with billionaires, Wall Street and corporate power.It’s important that we consistently punchupat billionaires and the politicians doing their bidding and refrain from punchingdownat people who voted for Trump. To break out of Trump’s story of the “smug and condescending affluent liberal protester”, we should avoid messages that are, indeed, smug and condescending (eg, “In this house, we believe science is real”) or that mock people for their economic struggles (eg, “How are you feeling about voting for cheaper eggs now?”). Such messages are self-indulgent and counterproductive, and we can do so much better.Organizing for powerFinally, if we are to make our protests as effective as possible, we should recognize protest for what it is: a tactic. Protest is not an end in itself. Tactics require larger long-term power-building strategies. Absent strategy, protest can sometimes still hold some short-term strategic value (eg, showing that dissent exists), but if we want to accomplish more than a flash in the pan – if we genuinely intend to shape history, as powerful movements before us have done – then we need to figure out what to do after the protest ends and everyone goes home.Saturday’s Trump protests weren’t perfect. But they brought a glimmer of hope | Moira DoneganRead moreThe key is organization. Organizations transform episodic moments of outrage into sustained campaigns that can win concrete victories. Without organization, we’re no match for the powerful forces we’re up against. It’s no accident that the five decades when labor unions and other participatory organizations have declined are the same decades when capital consolidated control of our political system and inequality grew worse and worse.To rebuild people power, we need to build organizations with structure, leadership development and capacity for sustained campaigns and struggle. There are all kinds of organizations: labor unions, place-based (local and statewide), issue-based, faith and congregation-based, and more (check out thelist of partner organizationsthat helped plan the 5 April “Hands Off!” protests). If you’re showing up to the protest as a lone individual, let it be your on-ramp to longer-term collective action. Figure out where you fit in, what capacity you can add, what skills you can develop, how much time you can give. Even just a few hours a month, when multiplied by millions, can amount to a formidable force – the kind of people power we need to defeat authoritarianism and oligarchy.Because ultimately we’re not trying to build “protest movements”, we’re trying to buildpeople’smovements; movements that use protest as one tool among many, whose ultimate aim is to win a real voice for working people in determining the policies that impact our lives and communities – and to make an America that works forall of us.Jonathan Smuckeris a political organizer, campaigner and strategist who co-founded Popular Comms Institute, PA Stands Up, Lancaster Stands Up, Common Defense, Beyond the Choir and Mennonite Action.

But another possibility is brewing, if in a quiet, careful, Canuckian way: that he could also be one of the best.Trump’s threats towards Canada appear delusional. But it’s useless to ask if his remarks about the “51st state” are a joke. He doesn’t joke about things he doesn’t want, and the jokes are designed to soften the ground. He says Canada is freeloading militarily (because the two countries both defend the Arctic). He says the US is subsidising Canada economically (because Americans buy Canadian oil). He says fentanyl is flooding over the border (it isn’t). He wants to renegotiate that border, calling it “artificial” (like every other border on Earth). Now he has taken concrete action, slamming25% tariffson the crucial car industry (which was better integrated with the US in 1965 to help American companies sell more American cars).Trump’s 90-day global tariff pause, announced Wednesday, does not apply to the tariffs on Canada.If Trump makes good on the claim that he can “permanently shut down automobile manufacturing business in Canada”, it would decimate the Golden Horseshoe economic powerhouse region around Lake Ontario. The hurt is already real. Stocks on the TSX have decreased about 9% since its position in January before inauguration. Jobs fell last month for the first time in more than two years.Stellantis(formerly Chrysler Canada) has closed a plant. Unions feel betrayed by their US comrades for selling them down the river. A major biotech firm in Toronto has gone bankrupt.But Trump has made a mistake. He has taken thatold South Park lineseriously: he has blamed Canada. The whole point of the joke is that it’s inherently ridiculous for the most powerful state in history to lay its problems at the feet of its small, friendly neighbour. And Canadians have been willing to troll Trump back, joking that if Canada joined the US, it would be a blue state. Or that Canada burned down the White House 200 years ago and will do it again (former prime minister Jean Chrétien, 91, joked that this was still an option, although he’s “too old to do it”).Internally, Trump has inspired a level of solidarity that has not been seen in decades, even in what Justin Trudeau once called the world’s “first postnational state”. “Elbows up” memes are flooding social media, referring to hockey legend Gordie Howe’s tactic of using his elbows to rather aggressively defend himself. Shoppers are using an app called Buy Beaver toboycott US products. You know economic patriotism is real when the most leftwing political partysuggests victory bondsthat could be deducted from your pay to help you invest in Canada.If it’s fair to say that being cut off from the US would hurtCanadaeconomically, then it’s also true that Canadians are being shaken out of a reliance on their neighbour. Canada has been so close to the world’s richest economy for so long, it’s easy to forget it has two coasts facing the second and third richest: Europe and China. It’s already the world’s eighth largest food exporter. And with the US abolishing renewable energy subsidies, Canada could become a green economy leader – not least by expanding its nuclear industry for export. Relying on the US has been a crutch: any business student knows you get a better price if you have multiple customers.Canada could also find a new ally in … itself. US-Canadian trade was worth $762bn (£597bn) last year, and about 77% of its exports go to the US, but a still sizable $373bn was traded across Canadian provinces. There are internal tariffs and barriers for trade between provinces which mean, for example, that it can cost C$60 (£33) in Ontario for a C$15 bottle of British Columbia red. Last month, the trade minister cut those exceptions in half. The Globe and Mail newspaper argues that new rules will probably encourage the country’sMaple 8 pension funds– massive global investment players with $2tn to play with – to invest more heavily in Canadian firms.And overall, Canada hasn’t actually come off too badly from Trump’s cunning plan to destabilise the global economy. With Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, promising $11bn to support the auto industry, and the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, saying its own retaliatory 25% tariff would go to affected workers and firms, auto production and investment could weather the storm, if not thrive. With Europe and Chinapotentially facing tariffs of 20% andmore than 100%respectively, deals with Canada on all sorts of goods will start to look pretty appealing.Then there’s Trump’s sudden reversal of that subject of decades of Canadian hand-wringing: the brain drain. How many health expertscanned from the Centers for Disease Control, or scientists whoseresearch was cancelled, or hotshot students terrified of beinggrabbed by men in masks, pushed into unmarked cars and disappeared indefinitely into camps run by private companies, will choose Canada instead? Immigration is already one of the country’s great strengths. The US snubbing its nose at the inscription on its own Statue of Liberty is only to Canada’s gain.Last but not least, Trump is somehow engineering the reverse political trick in Canada of the one he’s famous for in the US: instead of helping more clones of himself win office, his threats have left Trumpy Canadian candidates out in the cold. The Conservative party leader,Pierre Poilievre, who is unable to attack Trump as it’s pretty clear he’s a fan, has seen his 25-point lead evaporate.Canada to counter ‘unjustified’ US tariffs with 25% taxes on US cars, says CarneyRead more“We must now think about how we ensure that the country survives in a way that we haven’t had to think about before,” the historian Margaret MacMillan recently told the Globe. Divorce encourages new relationships. Trump the bully became dimly aware recently that nobody likes the US any more when heanxiously posted in the middle of the nightthat the EU and Canada better not band together or else he’d hit them even harder, “in order to protect the best friend that each of those two countries has ever had!” Is it possible for a country to eyeroll?Canada’s $2tn economy is one-fifteenth the size of America’s $30tn one. There’s no winner in an all-out war, but there’s definitely a bigger loser. What can’t be bad, though, is that Trump has caused Canada to come together and start re-evaluating its role in the world. In 1866, when the US decided – unilaterally, of course – to stop respecting the Canadian-American Reciprocity Treaty, it spurred Canada to finally build railroads across the country, and ultimately to welcome Manitoba and British Columbia into confederation. It was also, not coincidentally, the last time Americans tried to invade.Chris Michael is a Guardian US live news editor, host of the Reverberate podcast and editor of Seascape: The State of Our OceansExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionTrump tariffsTariffsTrump administrationUS foreign policyAmericasDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Foreign studentsface deportationfor infractions as minor as parking or speeding tickets. A reported500 student visashave been suddenly revoked–with some students sent to deportation centres, and others told to “self-deport”. With a million foreign students warned by their universities not to travel abroad for fear of never getting back in, that’s a strong deterrent to others deciding whether to study in the US.Jo Johnson, former minster for universities, King’s College London visiting professor and chair of the Lords education committee, listening to this list of persecutions, spoke to me from San Diego. “The UK should be extending the warmest of welcomes, a safe port in a storm,” he says. Concerns about immigration numbers shouldn’t enter the calculation about attracting foreign students. “We need these highly motivated, highly educated people.” He reels off the great benefits they bring: “They are our second largest export after finance, bringing over £40bn to our economy. Our workforce needs them, with an ageing population and a falling birthrate.” If Britain turns such students away, there will be global competition for them.But the cabinet in London is tussling between conflicting objectives. Around the table, ministers have agreed immigration numbers need to come down. But agreement ends there. As a result, a white paper on immigration promised for January has been put off until “after Easter”. The conflict divides the Home Office – where, like it or not, Yvette Cooper will be judged on immigration numbers – from other departments needing migrants to meet their goals. The high housing target needs225,000 more construction workersto build homes and work on green energy projects. With131,000 vacancies, we need care workers, alongside nurses and medics. And we need the best scientists we can get to swell our life sciences and artificial intelligence ambitions. Add in chefs and hundreds more missing skills.Of course, that’s not satisfactory. As the Home Office rightly protests, we never trained our own people. Native British snobbery meant we never invested in non-university skills, with further education and apprenticeships rottenly underfunded. It’s good that the government is accelerating this now. But we are where we are. The results will take time, and growth can’t wait.Meanwhile, some universities are teetering towards bankruptcy, relying on overseas students’ fees – up to £60,000 for an MBA – to subsidise UK students. Overseas students contributed£11.8bn in feesin 2022-23, accounting for 23% of total income. University towns need their spending.Now the US is crashing in international repute, and the extraordinary fact is that at the last count in 2023,more than a quarter of the world’s countries(58) were headed by someone educated in the UK. Why would we want anything other than more of that mighty soft power? The Home Office says, of course, it wants the world’s brightest and best – but at the same time it says it wants to clamp down on feared abuses of the system.It doesn’t know how many, but some of the 10,000 people in asylum hostels who first arrived on a visa came as students, andclaimed asylumafter their degree and two permitted working years had expired. Areview last yearfor the government by the Migration Advisory Committee found that those on a graduate visa earn a similar amount and are in the same level of jobs overall as domestic graduates, many of whom are also not in “graduate jobs”.Labour is also acutely aware that52% of the public want immigration cut. Roughly38,000 asylum seekersare living in publicly funded hotels. A third of asylum claimants arrive undocumented, mostly in small boats. That’s a problem, as any state needs to assert its power to decide who comes in: loose borders feel like losing control. But don’t promise what you can’t deliver: Labour’s “smash the gangs” is barely more convincing than the Tories’ “stop the boats”.The salience of immigration fluctuates with rising and falling boat numbers: numbersrose 25% last year, and have been rising again this year. The government responds with action, increasing by 21% the number of enforced returns of those refused asylum, with38% more arrests and visitsover illegal working, often in exploitative conditions. Every government has to do all it reasonably can, but the plan to bar naturalisation for anyone who has made a dangerous journey is strongly opposed by migration experts as a useless deterrent that blights tens of thousands of people as “second-class citizens”.As anti-immigration sentiment has been falling for years, from 86% in 1979down to 52%, with 66% saying migrants havea positive impacton the economy, don’t fear voters as if they were all Faragists: treat them as grownups. The Institute for Government’swise report on Thursdaycalls for an annual migration plan “to end decades of incoherent, disconnected and unpredictable” policies around work visas to “more honestly weigh up the pros and cons of migration”. It would, it says, end the antagonistic relationship between the Home Office and other departments, and give certainty to employers and universities.Trump’s re-election to boost UK universities as fewer students choose USRead moreHonesty is the key word. Stop treating people as idiots. When asked in detail about immigration, people give sensible answers. Asked who should be admitted, they are positive about every occupation. Though in principle against the “low skilled”, theyare in favourof jobs in areas such as hospitality, farming and care work being filled.How about students? The public are in favour, by 61% with only 27% opposed,according to British Future. Since students make up 40% of total “immigrant” numbers, why not remove from the statistics all except those who eventually stay? Youth mobility for the under-30s will be part of resetting closeness to the EU, and is popular in Britain: these numbers, too, should be kept separate.The government’s white paper may threaten tighter controls on student visas, but each tightening deters some: the Tories barring students’ dependents just before the election caused a 15% fall, since students from India and Nigeria have families much younger. If growth really is the prime goal, then this is the moment to welcome more people to Britain to study, shunning the hostile US.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now it must provide the world with an alternative to US chaosFri 11 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 10.37 EDTShareMy condolences to everyone who spent days trying to play 5D chess with Donald Trump’s market-exploding tariff mess. Where Trump is involved, there is a cloud of malevolent chaos, and there is grift amid the chaos. What grandmasters there are to be found are almost certainly grandmasters of grift.When marketsdump $10tn in three daysand then gain trillions back in a single afternoon on the erratic decisions of one deeply corrupt person, you can be sure that a small number of people have made immense sums of money out of that volatility. Were the people responsible for abnormal spikes of buying into the markets (including call optionson various indexes and exchange-traded funds) on Wednesday morning – and again, 20 minutes before the tariff announcement went public – extraordinarily lucky? Were they in the right Signal group? Or were they just simplyfollowing Trumpon Truth Social, where he posted: “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT” –just a few hours before dropping the news that he waskind ofpulling back.The first takeaway for the EU – beyond the potential stock tips – is that Trump will back down under pressure. So don’t grovel: the 10% universal tariff is still there, as are last month’s tariffs on steel and aluminum, so why has the EU unilaterally stepped down itsretaliatory tariffswithout a corresponding step-down from the US?Trump, of course, is spinning his partial U-turn as a result of “these countries … calling me, kissing my ass”,as he braggedto a gathering of congressional Republicans on Tuesday night. I have no doubt that Trump – whom hundreds of mental health professionals have described as having such a striking and serious case ofmalignant narcissismthat they were willing to break a professional rule and diagnose him from a distance – would have loved for that to be true. But let me go out on a limb and say that it wasn’t the ass-kissing or any “deals”. It was that investors and funds the world over were fleeing anything and everything linked to the US – including its sovereign debt.Trump is pushing the world towards recession. By learning the lessons of 2008, we can still prevent it | Gordon BrownRead moreThere is a longstanding phenomenon whereby Europe tends to overvalue the US’s power and underestimate its own. Europe neither “kissed ass” nor retaliated over the “liberation day” tariffs; it observed as the market carnage and threat to US Treasury bonds punched a hole in the idea of the US as impregnable. Imagine how much faster the flood away from the US and to safety elsewhere (including the euro) would have been if the EU hadimmediately usedits so-called bazooka, theanti-coercion instrument– a powerful new regulation that would allow it to target US services industries such as banking and tech.The second takeaway is that the rest of the world is ready to bypass the US’s chaos and unpredictability – it just needsEuropeto be the alternative. What Trump also does not understand is that the US may have a trade deficit, but it was a net exporter of trust – until it blew up an interlocking economic and security order that it had designed, built and maintained over eight decades – and of which it was the primary beneficiary. As a result, the view from Brussels now is that “there is no long-term credibility” with the US, Claus Vistesen, of Pantheon Macroeconomics, told me.Europe, on the other hand, plays by the rules. In the long run the more dents Trump pounds into the rule of law and the idea that the US is stable, rather than erratic, the stronger the euro’s argument for replacing the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Which brings me to the third takeaway.In the face of the Trump administration’s very real animosity towards it, the EU must act as swiftly as possible to shore up its greatest weakness: its dependence on fossil-fuel imports. Sometimes, the animosity is almost laughably tragicomic, such as when US commerce secretary Howard Lutnickranted that Europeans“hate our beef because our beef is beautiful and theirs is weak”. Other times, it’s more transparent, such aswhen Trump claimedthere would be no negotiations unless the Europeans “pay us a lot of money on a yearly basis, number one for present, but also for past”. As in, in Trump’s mind,$350bn in annual purchasesof US natural gas in exchange for lifting tariffs.Over the past few months, the refrain that governments should weaken climate regulation in order to promote growth has picked up. This would be a truly pyrrhic victory – primarily because Europe is acutely vulnerable to climate breakdown, the human and financial costs of which are staggeringly worse at every half-degree of heating, but also because the EU’s dependence on imported fossil fuels – from Russia, or from the US – is a glaring strategic and economic weakness. In fact, the grand irony of Trump’s pro-fossil fuel agenda is that he has exploded the green re-industrialisation that actually was taking place, thanks to Joe Biden’sInflation Reduction Act, leaving the door wide open for someone else.So, to paraphrase the tech bros, if Trump is going to move fast and break things, then let’s move fast andbuildthings.“Europe can turn this into a window of opportunity to further its edge with the US on clean tech,” says Simone Tagliapietra of the Brussels thinktank Bruegel. He advocates for adecarbonisation bank, completing the single market as urged by Mario Draghi, and issuing new eurobonds.The mantra going forward should be “whatever it takes” to fully replace fossil fuels with renewables – designed in Europe, built in Europe – so that it never spends $350bn to import gas from the US, Russia, or anywhere else.Alexander Hurst is a Guardian Europe correspondentExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionEuropean UnionTrump administrationTariffsFossil fuelsDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

This week, humiliated by Nigel Farage. Next week, who can tell?Fri 11 Apr 2025 07.35 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 13.53 EDTShareIt’s intriguing to watch the Conservative party treating next month’slocal electionsin England like a movie in which it has a secret cameo. Please don’t spoil the surprise for the fans! But yes – it turns out it is actually in this film. Who knew? For all of Labour’s many upsets since it came to power, it doesn’t feel as though a single one has been skilfully turned in the Tories’ favour. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is very, very bad – so bad that you can’t even be bothered to come up with anything other than a will-this-do nickname for her. Kemi Very Badenoch.More often than not since KVB beat Robert Jenrick in the leadership equivalent of Argentina v West Germany, she has seemed to be running the party like a performance art project you really wouldn’t want to see. Sorry – that’s obviously a tautology. We can just say “like a performance art project”. For almost six months now, Badenoch has made a huge deal of the fact that she quite deliberatelydoesn’t have any policies, instead repeatedly promising the “biggest policy renewal programme in 50 years”. Given what minuscule amount has actually emerged, I’m afraid my ears can now only rearrange that declaration into “I will come up with some policies in about 50 years”.Instead of policies, Badenoch has bandwagons, whose drivers regard her as an unwanted ride-hitcher. She’s sort of hiding in the bike rack of the bandwagon, or possibly beneath the bandwagon, clinging on to its chassis. Eventually, her presence becomes detected, and those pushing for new or different grooming gang inquiries note she’s suddenly noisily on board. Which is odd, considering that Rishi Sunak’s government could only be arsed to implementonly a very fewof the last inquiry’s recommendations – and that the role of women and equalities minister in that government was held by one Kemi Badenoch.But leaving aside her policy (singular?) for a while, this week Very Badenoch could be found on the airwaves declaring that the Tories were open to making deals with Reform UK on local councils. “I have categorically said that I’m not doing deals with Reform,”she said, going on to effectively list several examples of ways the Tories could do deals with Reform at local level. What has brought on this logical collapse? According to Kemi: “When someone says they want to destroy you, you don’t invite them into your house and ask to do a deal.” But also you sometimes do, because: “You don’t get to have a rerun of an election at a local level.” Do you get to have reruns of elections at a national level? If not, what is she on about? AGAIN?View image in fullscreenNigel Farage on the local election campaign trail in Ripley, Derbyshire, 10 April 2025.Photograph: Jacob King/PAThis is a rhetorical inquiry that appeared to be shared by Nigel Farage, who lost no time in playing a similar hand rather better. Farage won’t do a deal, until he will, but unlike Badenoch he did remember that what you’re supposed to do when asked these types of questions is explain why the other lot would be an absolutelyterrible choiceto vote for.But look, Badenoch has other idiosyncratic ways of rallying her troops, launching her party’s local elections campaign on Thursday by explaining to members that if you map the 2024 general election results on to the local council seats being contested, “we lose almost every single one”. Thanks for dialling in, Braveheart. Thus far, the sole point Kemi seems to have taken in the campaign is down to BBC Breakfast’s ludicrous decision to try to shame her fornot having watched Adolescence– a crime that is fast becoming on a par with not having cried in the street when Princess Di died. That said, back in real life, we can scientifically estimate that her Adolescence retort is worth about a 0.0001% swing in Broxtowe.I’ve quit the Tory party because it’s become a Trumpesque mess. Others will follow | Jamie GreeneRead moreAlas, away from her safe space – minor culture-war skirmishes and posting on X – Badenoch tends to come off as incredibly poorly prepared, given to relying on a set of about four assumptions in the absence of that preparation, and consequently can only be regarded as terminally out of her depth.This may well be the conclusion of various donors, with a Times story on Thursday ascribing adrop in donationsto the Conservatives to concerns over her leadership. It certainly features some eye-catching quotes from big donors. “It’s a bit like a new Tesla,” decided one. “Do you really want to put your money in it until you see if it’s actually going to get to the end of the road?” Tesla! If there’s one stock that the Tory leader would prefer not to be equated with right now, our anonymous friend may well have alighted upon it. Even so, that flight of fancy was a lot more appealing than another big Tory donor, who confirmed the withholding of funds from the Badenoch-led iteration of the party by explaining affectlessly: “My lot are waiting for evidence that their money will actually buy influence.” I suppose it’s quite bracing to hear people talking openly about the purchase of political influence, even if they won’t put their name to it (yet).All of which suggests we might as well brace for another summer of Conservative attempts to blood-let. As the grasshopper rubs its legs, so the Tory party sharpens its axe. Really, very little is starting to suggest the onset of long balmy days like the unmistakable desire to throw open the windows, and then to throw a leader out of one.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsConservativesOpinionKemi BadenochLocal electionsNigel FarageReform UKLocal politicscommentShareReuse this content"

We can do it againProfessor Alexandra Bitušíková explains how face-to-face local activism was crucial in bringing down Marian Kotleba, leader of the People’s Party Our SlovakiaAlexandra BitušíkováFri 11 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 05.13 EDTShareHaving grown up in Banská Bystrica in totalitarian Czechoslovakia, I vividly remember standing in the city’s historic square a few days after 17 November 1989, the startof theVelvet Revolution, holding candles in solidarity with the students protesting in Prague. Never would I have imagined that 35 years later, I would be speaking at a rally in the same square, this time urging the preservation of democracy.Back then, when I was a young social anthropology academic at our local university, activism was far from my mind. But everything changed for me in 2013 whenMarian Kotleba, leader of the neo-Nazi People’s Party Our Slovakia, was elected as regional governor. The shock was enormous. No one I knew had believed that such an outcome was possible, yet it happened. Realising the dangers this posed, many like-minded individuals knew we couldn’t stand by idly.View image in fullscreenMarian KotlebaIllustration: Guardian Design/Reuters/Getty ImagesOn the night after the election, a group of us gathered on the steps of the Museum of the Slovak National Uprising, a site symbolising resistance against Nazi Germany and its Slovak puppet state. Echoing the past, we lit candles, shed tears, sang songs and embraced. That moment marked the beginning of our discussion of how to promote democratic values actively. Our goal was not to oppose a democratically elected candidate but to cultivate democratic awareness throughout the region andSlovakia. Not to talk but to do.From this small gathering emerged an informal grassroots movement that played a crucial role in mobilising civil society against Kotleba and his extremist party. A few hundred volunteers, with no prior activism experience, were driven by the passion to defend our freedoms and ensure Slovakia never returned to its history of Nazi or communist tyranny.The struggle was long and often discouraging. In 2016,Kotleba’s party gained seats in the national parliament, emboldening his supporters. Yet in 2017, after four years of relentless effort, we succeeded in helping to oust Kotleba as regional governor. Our movement, Not in Our Town (Niot), exposed his extremist ideology through public discussions, educational programmes, protests and cultural events. We worked with journalists, academics and activists to distribute fact-based flyers detailing his mismanagement of the economy, hisracist statementsand harmful policies. We organised screenings of films likeA Hole in the Head (about the Roma Holocaust) and The White World According to Daliborek (a documentary about contemporary neo-Nazis). We also engaged schools and local organisations to educate young people about democracy, tolerance and Slovakia’s history of extremism. Our Schools for Democracy programme, a joint initiative of Niot and the Centre for Community Organising, used a method called living libraries, where individuals from various minority groups shared their life stories in classrooms.More from this seriesLoading...A critical strategy was increasing voter participation, since Kotleba’s 2013 victory resulted largely from low turnout and apathy: in the run-off that elected him,only 25% turned up to vote. Through social media campaigns, door-to-door outreach and public events, Niot encouraged citizens to vote in the 2017 elections. Our campaign Spolu je nás viac (Together We Are Stronger) directly engaged voters, explaining how abstention enabled extremism. For example, we showed how Kotleba rejectedmillions of eurosin EU funds that could have improved schools and hospitals.Most impactful, however, was talking to people face to face. This way we were able to explain Kotleba’s failures as a governor: blocking EU funds, neglecting economic growth and implementing discriminatory practicestargeting the Roma, Jews and migrants. None of these had put money in people’s pockets – in fact, Kotleba’s governorship had made life worse for many ordinary voters. Underhis leadership, the Banská Bystrica region had thelowest investment levelsin Slovakia and rising unemployment.View image in fullscreenProtesters in Bratislava, Slovakia, gather to demonstrate against the country’s pro-Russia prime minister, Robert Fico, 7 February 2025.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesRecognising that fragmented opposition had weakened past election efforts, Niot facilitated dialogue among democratic and moderate groups to unite behind a single democratic candidate. Ján Lunter, a respected businessman and credible alternative to Kotleba, emerged as the strongest challenger.Our efforts paid off. In the 2017 regional elections, Lunter won nearly 49%, while Kotleba suffered a crushing defeat with only 23%. It was a decisive moment, proving the power of grassroots activism. We were happy, but we knew this was only one battle in a longer struggle.Then, in October 2023, Robert Fico became Slovakia’s prime minister for the fourth time, adopting an increasingly anti-EU and pro-Russia stance. His governmentintroduced legal changeswidely seen as attempts to shield party affiliates from corruption investigations. Civil society mobilised once again.On 22 December 2024, Ficovisited Vladimir Putinin Moscow – without any public explanation. The next day, just before Christmas, Niot organised the first protest against Fico’s visit to Moscow and his foreign policy. Despite the holiday season, hundreds gathered in Banská Bystrica.Since then, Niot has held weekly protests and marches each Friday, featuring speeches by activists, artists and academics. We coordinate closely with movements – such as Peace for Ukraine – in other cities, maintaining a peaceful, non-violent and pro-democratic stance. Police cooperation has been excellent.Our key message since December 2024 is simple: “Slovakia is Europe. We are Europe”. Living less than 220 miles (350km)from Ukraine’s border, the prospect of Slovakia aligning with Russia is alarming. Our protests have grown,now attracting 5,000 to 10,000 weekly participants in Banská Bystrica, a town of 75,000.On 7 February 2025, more than 100,000 people took part in protests in more than 40 Slovak cities as well as in cities abroad such as Prague, Brno, London, Luxembourg, Paris, Stockholm, Copenhagen and New York.Tens of thousands in Slovakia protest against PM’s shift towards RussiaRead moreDespite threats, we refuse to be silenced. In January 2025, aTelegramchannel published the home addresses of several Niot activists, leading to increased police monitoring of local activists. Nevertheless, Niot continues to organise protests and public discussions across Slovakia to foster dialogue and engagement among diverse communities.Our organisation remains an informal grassroots platform, without a legal status. Decisions are made collectively, and our mailing list includes only about 150 citizens. The initiative’s strength is in its diversity and authenticity. And in lots of off-line, face-to-face discussions that contribute to building mutual trust. We simply follow our right to gather, express our views and act on facts.Slovakia is one of Europe’s most beautiful yet often overlooked countries. Though small in size, the Niot movement is determined to defend democracy here. It is not extremism but indifference that is the real enemy of freedom.Since the Velvet Revolution and our accession to the EU in 2004, Slovakia has flourished despite the challenges of populism. History has taught us painful lessons: we were invaded by the Nazis in 1939, fell into communist totalitarianism in 1948 and suffered Soviet occupation in 1968. Not in Our Town says, “Never again. We will not be silent.”Professor Alexandra Bitušíková is a social anthropologist at Matej Bel University in Banská Bystrica, SlovakiaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What happens from here?Nicki HutleyI’ve seen my fair share of wild rides on the stock market. Nothing comes close to what we are witnessing todayThu 10 Apr 2025 23.05 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 02.43 EDTShareIbegan my career in financial markets in 1987, so it’s fair to say I’ve seen my share of wild rides in those markets and the real economy, but nothing comes even close to what we are witnessing today. This is not because of the scale of the volatility and damage caused to date – there has certainlybeen a lot worseover the Dow Jones’s long history.Rather, what sets this period apart is that markets are responding to deliberate decisions made by the president of the world’s largest economy, who appears to understand neither the basic economic principles of trade, nor those of good policymaking process.Trump’s tariffs are rattling Australian markets. Here’s what not to do to protect your investmentsRead moreThe USbond market sell-offwas a massive vote of no confidence in the president’s signature economic policy. US bonds have been seen asa safe haven for decades, typically rallying in times of uncertainty, so the plunge in bond prices this week was telling us that trust in the US economy had been substantially eroded.When the world’s most powerful man says he is coming up with policy in the early morning that is “written from the heart” because people “were getting yippy” we should all be very concerned. All the more so because it was a decision that countermanded another that went into effect less than 24 hours before.Of course, everyone is now asking: what happens from here?Firstly, we still don’t know what the ultimate level of tariffs will be when the dust finally settles – assuming that it will settle at some point, which looks a fairly big assumption with this erratic president. Firstly, Trump has announced a “pause”, not a reversal. And, secondly, any relief that the pause might have engendered is today being rapidly eroded as the bilateral trade war with Chine escalates, with tariffs now set at 145% on Australia’s major trading partner.0:41’They are kissing my ass’: Trump says countries are pleading to negotiate tariffs – videoThere are plenty of economic models that can tell us what the ultimate fallout from tariffs will be at a given level. Even with the tariffs set at “liberation day” levels, the cost to the Australian economy was not seen to be large. GDP is expected to beabout 0.25% lower this year according eminent economist Warwick McKibbin’s model. For comparison, this is pretty much the same effect as thefederal treasury saidwe should expect in the March quarter from ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred. The same model suggests the economy will be almost half a percentage point lower as a result of tariffs over the longer term. So, it’s not good, but we’re not talking recession.However, those forecasts were made when China was facing just 54% tariffs from the US, so we can expect the hit – should tariffs imposed on China remain at the latest 145% rate – to China and Australia to be larger. Our economy was forecast by Treasury in the budget papers to grow by a tepid 2.25% in 2025. Knocking even a quarter of a percentage point of that growth estimate does not augur well for households that have seen living standards eroded for several consecutive years.But here’s the thing about these forecasts. McKibbin observed that, even while he’s not expecting a recession, that could change in the face ofevaporating confidence. Earlier this week, we saw theApril Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer SentimentIndex fall 6%, a six-month low. Critically, the survey was taken over a few days, and sentiment was a whopping 10% lower in those surveyed after “liberation day”.We have yet to see the impact on business confidence, which was at subdued levels even before the most recent chaos. Uncertainty is the enemy of investment, and it would be remarkable if the current uncertainty did not lead to at least a pause on investment and hiring decisions for many corporations. The extent of that pause will be critical for our economic decision makers.Indeed, for policymakers, this is a devilishly tricky time, and perhaps brings back memories of the early days of the pandemic, when, like today, it was unclear what we were dealing with and just how bad things would get. As in those days, our most senior economic policymakers have been gathering to discuss options and scenarios.The good news is that Australia has plenty of monetary and fiscal fire power available to mitigate against a downturn. The federal budget may be back in the red, but the government has plenty of borrowing power if need be. Similarly, the Reserve Bank has plenty of scope to lower interest rates.Unlike financial markets, however, our financial regulators are not yet panicking. The RBA governor, for example, has said it’s too early for a large or “out-of-session” interest rate cut, although a standard (25 basis points) cut is now seen by markets as a fait accompli for the May meeting, and more will be needed to avoid a return to the economic doldrums of the past year.At this point, however, the only thing that can be said with any certainty is that we are now on a rollercoaster ride that none of us are enjoying.Nicki Hutley is an independent economist and councillor with the Climate CouncilExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyOpinionTariffsReserve Bank of AustraliaInterest ratescommentShareReuse this content"

O’Brien on Thursday said the Coalition would review the target if it wins office and deflected a question on whether a Dutton government would remain a signatory to the Paris agreement, saying the Coalition would “always act in the national interest”.Coalition confirms it is committed to Paris climate agreement, hours after refusing to rule out withdrawingRead moreWithin hours of the debate, the Coalition was forced to clarify O’Brien’s comments andreaffirm its commitmentto Paris. But the Coalition appears intent on winding back the 2030 target if it is elected next month – a move that would weaken our bipartisan commitment to net zero by 2050 and be against the interests of the global climate.Resetting the 2030 targetThe Coalition has long disputed Labor’s claims that the 43% target would be met.In June last year, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton,claimed the Albanese government has “no hope of achieving the targetsand there’s no sense signing up to targets you don’t have any prospect of achieving”.In January, Dutton saida Coalition governmentwould remain party to Paris, despite Donald Trump’s move to withdraw his nation from the deal.On Thursday, O’Brien confirmed a Coalition government would review the 43% target. In doing so, it would consider three factors: Australia’s emissions trajectory, the state of the economy and the Coalition’s suite of policies – including nuclear power and more gas.O’Brien went on to say:Labor, the Coalition, nobody in this country will be able to achieve the emission target set by Chris Bowen and Anthony Albanese. The difference between Peter Dutton and Anthony Albanese is that Peter Dutton has been honest and upfront about that.O’Brien would not rule out withdrawing Australia from the Paris deal, but later released a statement saying the Coalition remained committed to the agreement.Will Australia meet the 43% target?During the debate, Bowen claimed Australia is “on track” to meet its emissions-reduction goal. He pointed toanalysis by his departmentreleased late last year showing emissions are projected to be 42.6% below 2005 levels in 2030.Australia will have to work hard to meet the target, with our emissions reductions having stalled since 2021. The government’s projection assumes it achieves its target of 82% renewable electricity generation by 2030 – possible, but very challenging from about 45% today.It also depends on two policies to reduce emissions outside electricity, neither of which have yet demonstrated their progress.The first is thesafeguard mechanism, which aims to reduce emissions from heavy industry. It began in mid-2023 but its results are not yet clear. Second is thenew vehicle efficiency standard, introduced from January this year.What if Dutton does walk back Australia’s Paris commitment?Even if a Dutton government remained in the Paris agreement, walking back on the 43% emissions target is problematic for a number of reasons.Most obviously is that the threat of dangerous climate change is real and growing. The Paris deal aims to keep average global temperatures “well below” 2C above preindustrial levels, and ideally limit warming to no more than 1.5C.Butaccording to official data, Earth’s monthly global average temperature exceeded 1.5C above preindustrial levels for 11 months last year. So meeting the Paris commitment is already looking shaky.While the Paris agreement is a legally binding international treaty, there has been much debate as to the real meaning of “legally binding”. Some argue that national commitments to reduce emissions are not legally binding and can be revised in either direction. While a downward revision is liable to draw criticism, it could be alegally available option under the Paris agreement– transgressors don’t get kicked out of the club.But any downward revision on the targets is a bad look on the global stage. Jacqueline Peel, a climate law expert at the University of Melbourne,has arguedany moves by a future Coalition government to water down Australia’s 2030 target, or to submit a 2035 target weaker than our current pledges, would:… go against the spirit, if not the letter, of the Paris Agreement, and – in some circumstances – could constitute a breach of those obligations.Where to now?The Albanese government chose not to announce a 2035 target before the election. The opposition says it won’t set a 2035 target until it’s in government.That means voters will be left in the dark on this important issue as they head to the ballot box.At the moment, the Coalition appears to be relying on its controversial nuclear power plan to meet the bipartisan goal of net zero emissions by 2050. But analystshave warnedthe plan will lead to much more emissions between now and then.Meanwhile, there is far more work to be done outside the energy sector – in agriculture, transport, industry and more – to meet Australia’s climate commitments.Australia’s cost-of-living crisis has garnered much attention during the election campaign so far. There has been very little talk about how Australia’s entire economy will get to net zero.That’s a terrible reflection on the state of our politics. Ultimately, unmitigated climate change will be bad for the planet andvery bad for Australia.Tony Wood is the energy and climate change program director at the Grattan Institute.

All Rights ReservedA Real Pain‘A collective sigh of relief’: how Jesse Eisenberg’s A Real Pain went down in PolandEisenberg’s Holocaust-heritage comedy-drama was a big hit in the country where it is set – though some have questioned its lack of engagement with locals. Historians, critics and heritage tour guides give us their thoughtsAda PetriczkoFri 11 Apr 2025 09.16 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 09.18 EDTShareAReal Pain, Jesse Eisenberg’s film about two cousins on a heritage tour of Holocaust-related sites in Poland, has been largely embraced by Polish audiences, who appreciated its understated humour and conspicuous good intentions. Within a month of its release, the film had grossed more than $1m at the Polish box office – no small feat for an indie production in Poland. “There was a collective sigh of relief,” says Vogue Poland film critic Anna Tatarska, “that here was a Hollywood Holocaust narrative that didn’t cast Poles as historical villains.”Poland’s fraught relationship with Holocaust narratives has made films touching on it into political battlegrounds for at least a decade. Since the nationalist backlash against films such as Aftermath (Pokłosie) in 2012, andIdaa year later – each of which confronted Polish complicity in wartime Jewish persecution – cinema has become a flashpoint in Poland’s ongoing struggle with historical memory. Against this backdrop, A Real Pain occupies an unusually diplomatic position, and this political neutrality helped Eisenberg’s film achieve what others couldn’t: acceptance not only from Polish audiences but also officialdom.It’s a joy that people keep on coming here – to restore memory, to catch these threads from before the HolocaustWitold WrzosińskiPresident Andrzej Duda went so far as granting Eisenberg Polish citizenship during a ceremony in New York in March. Eisenberg, who had been interested in becoming a Pole for nearly two decades, called it an honour of a lifetime. “Poland as an idea gave me a certain meaning that I was missing,”he told the New Yorker in November. “Having a connection to something bigger, something historic, something traumatic, made me feel like I was a real person and not just floating through a lucky life of shallow emptiness.”But whileA Real Painwas promoted as Eisenberg’s love letter to Poland, many Poles still feel it failed to represent them adequately. Perhaps most tellingly, the film’s only significant interaction with the locals occurs in a single scene near the end, when the Kaplan cousins arrive at the house where their grandmother used to live and briefly talk with two neighbours. Poles are otherwise background characters – a mostly voiceless crowd of receptionists, waiters and taxi drivers. “Poland is only a backdrop here, a beautiful and wealthy decoration that is essentially empty, because no real people inhabit it,” historian and writer Irena Grudzińska-Gross said.Witold Wrzosiński, the director of the Jewish Cemetery in Warsaw, noted that Polish Jews, a community that today numbers some 30,000, are completely absent from the film. (Before the Holocaust, Jews made up 10% of Poland’s population; of the 3.5 million living there in 1939, only about 300,000 survived.) “It felt as if Eisenberg sent his love letter without an addressee,” he said. “And we watched it as outside spectators.”View image in fullscreenEisenberg and Jennifer Grey in the film.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyWrzosiński recalled that after a special screening for representatives of the Jewish community in Warsaw, there was a sense that the film missed some opportunities, mostly because of its choice not to develop local characters. “The most unexpected, cinematic situations during heritage tours happen at the crossroads between the visitors and Poles,” said Wrzosiński, who spent years leading such tours. The Kaplan cousins arrive and leave Poland more or less unchanged – a narrative choice that is intentional and self-aware. But perhaps by focusing primarily on their relationship and their pain, the film is doing precisely what it claims to be against – it fails to engage with Poland and the Holocaust in a meaningful way.Poland is only a backdrop here, because no real people inhabit itIrena Grudzińska-Gross“I think that people on these trips put a lot of pressure on themselves to feel something. We’re very good at manufacturing the kind of experiences that we expect to have,” said Adam Schorin, a writer from New York who has worked as a heritage tour guide in Poland. “But what I found more interesting when visiting Holocaust-related sites are questions about the nature of remembrance, such as what are we actually seeing and how can we engage with a place that has been photographed a million times and perhaps recently renovated?”The most biting critique, perhaps, lies in the film’s selective amnesia, sidestepping uncomfortable conversations about wider antisemitism in Poland. “We don’t get to find out what happened to the cousins’ family during the war, and why their grandmother emigrated soon after. She must have had a good reason to leave, right? Otherwise she would have stayed,” says Grudzińska-Gross, who was forced to flee Poland in 1968 amid an antisemitic campaign.‘Every day is 24 hours of panic to just get out the door’: Jesse Eisenberg on self-indulgence, candid aunts and his Oscar-tipped Holocaust comedyRead more“I think many people fell into the trap of expecting too much from this film, and assuming that since it’s connected to the Holocaust, it must be epic, it must be anotherSon of Saul,” says Tatarska. “You can interpret these [artistic] decisions negatively, and there were people in Poland who did, but I would expect them to be mostly financially driven. I think this is a genuine love letter, but written by someone who has less lived experience and more ideas about what Poland could be.”But despite its shortcomings, Wrzosiński sees the film as a heartfelt attempt at overcoming disconnections. “There’s a sense of joy that people keep on coming here – and we see more of them each year – to restore memory, to catch these threads from before the Holocaust and to talk not only about how their ancestors died, but also about how they lived here for 20 generations. And if this film encourages anyone to do this, that’s great.”Explore more on these topicsA Real PainPolandJesse EisenbergKieran CulkinEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Not in living memory has a generation received more abuse than millennials. First the older generation told them their economic woes were due to a weak handshake in job interviews and a crippling addiction to brunch. Now, an even more malignant torrent of abuse is coming from below. Gen Z, in an attempt to distance themselves from the tragic fate of their forebears, have declared war.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Every young person seems to be mocking the sincerity and optimism of a generation – born roughly between 1981 and 1996 – who imbibed the spirit of the Obama era and seemed to believe that if they worked hard, their dreams would come true. Except they didn’t: instead came Brexit, Trump, Covid and AI-generated videos of Elon Musk doing the moonwalk.TikToker Kyle Gordon, for example, is now going viral for a parody millennial folk-pop song called We Will Never Die that blends We Are Young by Fun and Ho Hey by the Lumineers with the waistcoats and flat caps of Mumford & Sons. The song’s lyrics satirise the simplistic political messaging prevalent in the era of Occupy and Kony 2012: “Yup, we did a thing / We let our voices ring / Politicians, hear us sing, stop lyin”.As a gen Zer (just – I’m 1997) who has been shaped by millennial culture, I have seen a sharp rise in this sort of elder abuse. So much so that it informs much of my new show, Return of the Space Cowboy, which mines the tension between my innate gen Z scepticism and my desperate need to find something to believe in. As such, I simply cannot take the slander of my noble elders any more.They are a generation too old to be cool but too young to be viewed through rose-tinted (and fashionably oversized) frames. But mark my words, the near future will see the streets lined with millennial-themed bars with exposed brick walls and cocktails served out of mason jars. MGMT’s Time to Pretend will be triumphantly blasting out of the speakers as you remark that your “dad loves these guys”. People will start taking bathroom selfies with an iPhone 3G for that retro digital feel, while clad in smart-casual numbers, waistcoats with jeans, blazers with skinny chinos, fedoras and fraying festival wristbands snaking up their arms. Soon young people will be lamenting being born in the wrong era and say things like “take me back to 2013 so I can wear a bow tie while I penny board to my job making BuzzFeed listicles about which Friends character you are”.As a tribute to this maligned group of pioneers, I’ve collected four masterpieces made by millennials that have inspired me and deserve their place in the cultural canon.1.Girls (2012-2017)View image in fullscreenJilted generation … (l-r) the characters Marnie Michaels, Jessa Johansson, Hannah Horvath and Shoshanna Shapiro of Girls.Photograph: HBO/AllstarInGirls, Hannah Horvath says to her parents: “I don’t want to freak you out but I might be the voice of my generation … well a voice … of a generation.” The line was intended to highlight Hannah’s narcissism and self delusion but I do sincerely think that with Girls, Lena Dunham, who created the show and stars as Hannah, stakes a solid claim to being the voice of the millennials.Lena Dunham’s Girls: the show that turned TV upside downRead moreNo show better captures the essence of the 2010s more than Girls. A sitcom for an era that felt uniquely confusing and hard to define compared to the ones that came before. The groundbreaking realism of relationships shown for all their glorious awkwardness and weirdness – a far cry from the gloss of Friends or Sex and the City. A show that paired the uncertainty of being in your 20s with the uncertainty of post-financial crash New York.A show that was as heartbreaking as it was hilarious – take the opening scene where Hannah is being cut off from her middle-class parents and she reminds them, “I could be a drug addict. Do you realise how lucky you are?” Or there was the truly excruciating moment when Marnie tries to get back at her ex-boyfriend by singing a sincere rendition of Kanye West’sStronger; a scene so toe-curling that I have to hide behind the sofa like a dog on Bonfire Night whenever I watch it.It is one of the few shows I can watch over and over again because unlike most 30-minute TV shows it doesn’t follow a repetitive formula. Every episode is so unpredictable, the depth and complexity of the characters so much more than your usual sitcom archetypes, that I learn something new on every rewatch.2.Submarine (2010)View image in fullscreenKiller Wales … Craig Roberts in Submarine.Photograph: Film4/AllstarAt their worst, millennial films become pretentious aesthetic exercises in style over substance. But when it’s done right, as it was by Richard Ayoade in his debut feature, it results in a charming and hilarious coming-of-age film enriched with a patchwork of aesthetic references from French, Italian and British new wave cinema.We follow teenage oddball Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts) in his quest for love in front of the bleak industrial backdrop of 1980s Swansea. I saw this film in the cinema when I was 13 years old and couldn’t believe that a film could be so beautifully made and cinematically vibrant while simultaneously being so packed with so many great jokes. The 2010s was the era of the “dramedy”, AKA the blending of comedy and drama, and maybe there is no better example of this thanSubmarine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Millennial giants such as Eric André. The first time I saw André’s truly bizarre talkshow parody when I was 16 years old it felt as if I was watching a new sense of humour come into being. It is not as characteristically “millennial” as other things on this list because in many ways it was laying the ground for the unhinged brain-rot humour that defines the TikTok generation today.Comedian Eric Andre: 'We don't tell guests a thing ...'Read moreThe Eric Andre Show felt like it was only understandable to a generation that grew up with the internet. Whether it was getting seemingly unsuspecting celebrities on as guests and then making the atmosphere as deranged and chaotic as possible – the host throwing up and eating his own sick until the guest leaves, or the consistent smashing up of his desk – André was an early proponent of the unhinged humour that is now very much in the mainstream. The absurdist end of TikTok virality can be traced back to André’s underrated masterpiece.4.Alt-J – An Awesome Wave (2012)View image in fullscreenGive us a wave … Alt-J.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianAlt-J’s Mercury prize-winning debut album An Awesome Wave is a true millennial masterpiece. Not only because it’s a great album, but the rise and fall ofAlt-Jas a band is one of the great millennial tragedies. I was 14 when this album came out and people were musing that the new Radiohead, or even Pink Floyd, had arrived. The album was packed with obscure literary and cinematic references over a rich pulsating soundscape of haunting voices. White guys finally had new music to lecture women about.Until, in 2016, disaster struck. A video went viral of two drunk students making a parody of Alt-J’s music using a loop machine, a tambourine and repeatedly singing “put it up my butt” in different harmonies. It showed that anyone could make a song as good as any Alt-J song. Never before have I seen a parody song so quickly unpack a band’s mystique, and frankly Alt-J never recovered. Part of the reason they never recovered was because the band members have as much charisma as a recycling bin. Do you even remember any of their names? Exactly.Millennial internet culture had a tendency to eat itself – things became cool and uncool at ever quickening rates leaving little to hold on to. But sifting back through the archives of the early 2010s, I do think An Awesome Wave is a gorgeous album, worthy of its acclaim.Horatio Gould is touring the UK withReturn of the Space Cowboyfrom 2 to 23 May; tour starts Glasgow.

Following the news the show is to berebooted after 24 years off air, people have shared their recollections of its featured world record attempts, beloved and controversial presenters and theme song, Dedication.View image in fullscreenAndrew Brooke.Many of those who responded to the Guardian’s callout warmly remembered Roy Castle, one of the original presenters, as an all-round showbiz trouper. Castle, an accomplished trumpeter who performed Dedication at the end of each episode, broke nine world records himself and worked on the show until just months before his death from lung cancer in 1994.“Roy Castle brought joy to proceedings – I loved his warm and witty everyman persona,” said Andrew Brooke, 56, a retired teacher from Wells in Somerset. “Dedication must rank as one of the finest theme tunes in history, particularly as he sang and played a trumpet solo live each week. The lyrics were tweaked to fit the featured records attempts. I would occasionally sing them to inspire my pupils: ‘If you want to be the best, if you want to beat the rest, dedication’s what you need.’ Though there was usually no response at all from the children!”A letter from Roy Castle to Philip Reader.Brooke was one of many respondents who particularly enjoyed the attempts to break records live on the show. One that has stuck in his memory involved a barber trying to complete the most number of shaves in a minute: “He used a cut-throat razor on these men with five o’clock shadows and cut someone’s face in the process.”Sarah Shepley, 60, a retired scientist from Devon, recalled meeting Castle when she took part in two record attempts on the show in 1977. Then aged about 12, her church youth club in Ealing, west London, was invited toBBCWhite City to be part of a big tap dance ensemble in the courtyard. “We then joined a huge group of kids peeling onions. They gave us plastic knives for it which were useless. It was a hoot. Roy Castle sang ‘Don’t cry for me onion peeler’. Don’t Cry for Me Argentina was a No 1 hit that year. He was just a nice bloke, hilarious, a big kid.”A few people said the show inspired them to attempt to break records. Among them was Philip Reader, 56, from London, who back in his infant school in Brentwood in Essex roped in his best friend to see how far they could hop on one leg. He wrote to the programme and was delighted to receive a signed response from Castle, along with a “showbizzy” autographed photo. But he was disappointed to hear from the presenter that there was no recognised category for his record attempt.Reader, who works for Waitrose, said the show encouraged him to pursue his passion for music to this day. “It taught me about following your own ideas and not being afraid to stand out from the crowd,” he added. “‘Dedication’s what you need’ is the advice and encouragement that I have carried throughout my life.”View image in fullscreenMany readers said their memories of the show had been tainted after learning about the far-right politics of the two presenters, twins Norris and Ross McWhirter.Photograph: David Graves/Rex/ShutterstockAnother callout respondent had his hopes of breaking a record dashed by his parents’ revelations about a purportedly long-lived pet. Peter Allan, 60, a self-employed management consultant from East Renfrewshire, Scotland, said: “It was thanks to Record Breakers that I discovered my hamster had died.”Allan explained: “I had read that the average life expectancy of a hamster was 18 to 24 months. My 10-year-old self was so excited because my hamster ‘Jeemy’ was seven years old! I was busy composing a letter to Roy hoping Jeemy would become a record breaker when my dad informed me that Jeemy was actually Jeemy IV. Every time Jeemy died he was surreptitiously replaced. I was upset – not at the sad demise of my pets but at the wasted time and effort of letter writing!”Many readers said their childhood memories of the show have subsequently been tainted by learning about the far-right politics of the two other original presenters, twinsNorris McWhirterand Ross McWhirter.The Guinness World Records founders astounded many viewers with their recall of record-breaking facts and figures. But the brothers also co-founded the rightwing National Association for Freedom (Naff), later the Freedom Association, which campaigned against sporting sanctions imposed on apartheid-era South Africa.Ross McWhirter, who was assassinated by an IRA gunman in 1975, also advocated restrictions on the freedom of the Irish community in Britain, including compulsory registration with the police. Andrew Brooke said: “As my family is from Belfast, I guess that would have included us.”“As a child, Norris McWhirter just seemed to be a kindly old and eccentric uncle, wheeled out to amaze us with his remarkable memory,” Brooke added. “I also remember feeling very sorry for him after Ross was murdered.Terry ‘Turbo’ Burrow, who broke a record for cleaning windows, with presenter Cheryl Baker.Photograph: Handout“As I grew older and became more politically aware, I developed a severe aversion to Norris, after finding out that he ran a nasty rightwing thinktank. I couldn’t understand how the BBC would employ someone with such extreme views. Then again, vetting children’s TV presenters wasn’t exactly the BBC’s forte back then.”Other readers’ recollections of later series, after Norris McWhirter had left the show in 1985, were not tarnished by the subsequent presenters’ political leanings. Sue Wilde-Greer, 56, from Spain, recalled how her father, Mike, then a sales director for a window-cleaning kit company, was invited on the show in 1995 to judge an attempt to break the fastest window-cleaning record. “He loved being on the show,” she said. “He wore his best suit and we all sat down as a family to watch it.”The record-breakerTerry “Turbo” Burrowssaid his time on the show, then hosted by the former Bucks Fizz singer Cheryl Baker and the former Olympic and Commonwealth medal-winning athlete Kriss Akabusi was “truly amazing”. He went on to break his window-cleaning record a further nine times, bringing the record time down to 9.14 seconds.Explore more on these topicsChildren's TVBBCFactual TVTelevisionThe news on TVnewsShareReuse this content"

But with his acting career taking off and a genre-jumping new solo album, one of rock’s great polymaths is backFri 11 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTShareSitting in the belly of north London’s Islington Assembly Hall in the middle of four sold-out nights,TV on the Radiofrontman Tunde Adebimpe is recalling the precise moment he wanted to quit his band – and music – for ever. It was 2019 and the group, an art-rock four-piece who haven’t made a record that wasn’t adored by critics since emerging from Brooklyn in the early 00s, were opening for Weezer and Pixies at Madison Square Garden in New York.Over the years, they’ve made five studio albums and also lost bass playerGerard Smith, who died suddenlyin 2011. They’ve grieved and grown together. Adebimpe is their talisman. A tall, expressive focal point, able to rabble-rouse with songs such asWolf Like Me, or calm the congregation with low-slung tracks such as DLZ orYoung Liars.But by 2019, the ties that bound the band had begun to fray, due to a familiar mix of a demanding tour schedule and too much time living in each other’s pockets. “It should have been such a high point,” says Adebimpe of the Madison Square Garden gig. “But I remember thinking: ‘That was a good show, but I just never want to do this ever again.’”I had a very weird feeling of: I just want silence … as much as I can getThe malaise went further than one performance after a hard tour. “There’s a point where I had a very weird feeling of, like: ‘I think I’m done,’” he says, a few flecks of white in his beard giving away the fact he’s about to turn 50. “I think I’m just done listening to music. I don’t give a fuck about bands. I just want silence … as much as I can get it.”Adebimpe pressing pause seems about as likely as Donald Trump staying silent. Over the past 25 years, he has become one of the world’s most successful creative chameleons. The son of middle-class Nigerians who moved between St Louis, Pittsburgh and Lagos during his childhood, Adebimpe is able to oscillate between hyperbolic indie frontman, actor and visual art practitioner (he once worked as an animator on MTV’s Celebrity Deathmatch).He and TV on the Radio emerged in the aftermath of 9/11, in pre-gentrification Williamsburg, New York. Adebimpe lived in a loft offered to him by a friend. “He brings me to the third floor of this place, and it’s just, like, plywood on the windows and it’s freezing cold,” he recalls. “Just imagine a gigantic empty floor at the very end of it, there’s a lightbulb, a toilet and a sink, but you can see all of the pipes … going into the ground. And he’s like: ‘Yeah, we’re still working on it.’” The upside was the rent, $100 a month, which gave Adebimpe the space to work on the nascent version of TV on the Radio with guitarist Kyp Malone (they left copies of 2002’s OK Calculator, their ultra-rare debut CD, in Williamsburg coffee shops). But music wasn’t Adebimpe’s only pursuit. He also tried acting while at university and he has recently carved out a third career in film.On screen, he has proved incredibly versatile, able to handle the arthouse demands of being a lead in Sebastián Silva’s Nasty Baby and also deliver tender performances in Disney+ Star Wars spin-off Skeleton Crew and weather disaster sequel Twisters. The Hollywood moments have transformed the way his young daughter Echo (Adebimpe is married to French cartoonist Domitille Collardey) sees him. He’s gone from “dad who potters around in the garage with music and puppets” to a movie star. “There was a premiere for the first Skeleton Crew episode at Disneyland, and she was sitting next to me the whole time hitting me, just like: ‘You’re in this, daddy,’” he says, mimicking her shock and awe. “I was like … ‘I know.’”View image in fullscreenTunde AdebimpePhotograph: Xaviera SimmonsToday, we’re here to talk about his latest transformation, into a solo musician; a move that came after TV on the Radio’s mini-implosion. After the tour, he implemented a music ban. Then weeks passed. Slowly, Adebimpe, who’d thrown himself into making art, started to feel the musical urge. “It’s like a patch of weeds that you clip,” he says. “Things grow back, and thoughts grow back, and you hear melodies. I started having fun again, I was really trying to go back to zero.”After the hard reset, Adebimpe disappeared into his garage in Silver Lake, Los Angeles. He began to play with old demos. Mostly using simple drum machines and a couple of synths, he started crafting what would become the basis for his debut solo record, Thee Black Boltz. It sees Adebimpe and his co-producer, Wilder Zoby, the former frontman of Brooklyn indie-funk band Chin Chin, play with pop, hip-hop and glam rock, while snarling it all up with distortion and pounding drum patterns. If some of TV on the Radio’s more expansive songwriting pushedthe limits of what rock could be, Thee Black Boltz sees Adebimpe detach completely from the mothership and set off to coordinates unknown.It almost didn’t happen. Adebimpe had been shopping around some demos in 2020 and got a lot of polite nos. “I wasn’t expecting that much, but it was a very humbling experience,” he said. “Whatever cultural capital in the back of my head that I thought I, or we, might have amassed, didn’t exist.” Then he changed tack and decided to approach labels that had inspired him growing up. Sub Pop, the home of Nirvana and Earth, bit his hand off.The album’s lead single, the throbbing electropop of Magnetic, was a statement of intent but also a red herring. The record jumps between genres constantly. Ate the Moon and Blue aren’t far off the industrial hammer blows of Nine Inch Nails; Pinstack has the swagger of glam; second single, Drop, is gentle pop underpinned with scuzzy beatboxing; while The Most combines pulsing stabs of synthesiser with a sample of dancehall classicUnder Mi Sleng Teng.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The sentiment is: this is a gift for youThat might sound overwhelming, but it’s all tied together with Adebimpe’s voice – baritone and rich as ever – and lyrics that are nearly always about love, lost or otherwise. “It feels like the kind of mixtape I would have given to somebody in high school and said: ‘Here’s a couple of my favourite bands,’” says Adebimpe. “It all hangs together because the sentiment is: this is a gift for you.”TV on the Radio review – NYC art-rockers remain singular, energised and lupineRead moreOne song that stands out is ILY, a soft ode dedicated to Adebimpe’s younger sister, Jumoke, who died suddenly just as the Covid pandemic was nearing its end. She lived in Florida; his father had died and Adebimpe’s mother had moved back to Nigeria, so the responsibility fell on him to make arrangements. “I was the only family member, so I had to go down and essentially plan this funeral in the course of a week, call all of my relatives, put them on Zoom during this thing. I had to give the eulogy … in a mask,” he says, lowering his head. “It was the worst possible thing.”The song became a way for Adebimpe to channel his grief. “I had a sketch for it, and when we started writing the record, I found that again, and then finished it pretty quickly. I’m glad that had been floating around and I had a venue for those feelings, because your grief is proportional to the amount of love you have for this person who is, like …” he pauses. “I mean, she’s my best friend and I’m glad I had a place to put that.”The patch of weeds grew back, again.Thee Black Boltz is released via Sub Pop on18 April.Explore more on these topicsMusicTV on the RadiofeaturesShareReuse this content"

What she revealed was shocking and inspiringSinéad O'SheaFri 11 Apr 2025 08.44 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 11.16 EDTShare‘Sinéad, you must read my diaries. The most naked ones are in Emory College, Georgia.”This was a voicenote left for me by Edna O’Brien in 2023, after I had started to film a feature documentary with her, granting me access to the most personal work she created in her lifetime: her unpublished diaries.She had been initially reluctant to help me make the film. She was 92 and had cancer, so her time was limited. But she became more enthused after I showed her an old TV clip of herself in her 40s, with her parents.The entire Edna mythos was within that clip. Her mother claims that O’Brien’s books had never been an issue at home while her father is playing the role of the jovial Irishman. In reality he was a violent alcoholic and she was disgusted by her daughter’s writing. The British interviewer, oblivious, is delighted when her father starts to sing Danny Boy.Blue Road: The Edna O’Brien Story review – engaging study of a life less ordinaryRead more“I look worried and terrified,” she said when I showed her the video.She was hospitalised after that encounter but her interest was piqued and we began to talk more. She would record long voice memos via our executive producer, Barbara Broccoli, who was caring for her. One day, I received the message that O’Brien wanted me to read her diaries. They did not disappoint.She had led one of the great lives of the 20th century and everything was there: the early attempts at writing, her doomed marriage to Ernest Gébler, the publication of The Country Girls, love affairs with a litany of bad men, her complex family relationships,manydreams and many parties, alongside long and beautiful observations of nature.One extraordinary feature of the diaries, which are read by actor Jessie Buckley in the film, was the annotations that appeared below some of the earlier entries. They were often vicious commentaries and I suspected these were by Gébler (which was then confirmed to me by O’Brien and Gébler’s son, who recognised his father’s handwriting).At times, I feared that the author’s personal life and diaries were so colourful that they might distract from her literary achievements – as so often happens with female artists. In the end, my strategy in making the film was to attend to both sides of her.Here are five excerpts from the diaries that helped me tell those two parts of O’Brien’s story: the glamour and the doomed love, but also her intellectual abilities, the quality of her writing and its context – and what a thing it was to have created this work from such difficult circumstances.Prurient = itching with lewd desire.Winnow = separate.Ingenuousness = artlessness.This early entry shows O’Brien’s desire to teach herself a better vocabulary. The only books in her home were her mother’s prayer books and her horse-obsessed father’s bloodstock manuals.The novelist was born in 1930 in County Clare soon after the ending of British rule.Irelandwas floundering; locked in the economic war of the 1930s with Britain which had placed revenge tariffs on Irish goods after independence. Responsibility for health and education was outsourced to the highly patriarchal Catholic church.Language fascinated O’Brien, but her formal education was cut short when she was sent to train as a pharmacist in Dublin while in her teens. There she met Gébler, a successful writer who had written The Plymouth Adventure. His circle mocked her wide-eyed enthusiasms. This entry is from that era.I love that she continued to improve herself despite the snideness.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: © SOS ProductionsCarlos full of expressions and sweetness, went to Ennis, mostly tea, prepared to return, Ernie thinking more and more of himself.[annotation] Ernie fed up with her aunties, with her crude narrow-eyed Catholic disapproving tribe of six-toed trolls. They hate E.At first I was confused by these annotations. Could Gébler have been so malicious and would he have referred to himself in third the person? Very much yes, his son confirmed.This 1958 entry follows a visit to O’Brien’s parents. The couple moved to London shortly after but O’Brien was overcome with homesickness and wrote The Country Girls in weeks.This coming of age story set in County Clare won great acclaim for its frank and funny depictions of toxic best friends and terrible men, but many Irish people were mortified. It was banned, as were her next five books. One woman told me that as a child, she was instructed by her mother to burn The Country Girls in their back garden.Began second novel calling it The Lonely Woman.Ernie having sketched it out in detail and in time he would correct the manuscript equals re-write it.O’Brien’s success enraged Gébler and he began to believe he had written her books. She had to give her royalties to him in return for an allowance. Eventually she left.After a bitter custody battle, he returned to Ireland. Though O’Brien would write many great books after leaving him, he waged a whispering campaign against her for the rest of his life.He would also intercept her correspondence and pretend to be her agent to stop producers from adapting her work. Instead he recommended they approach the very talented Ernest Gébler.Edna O’Brien discusses men with Melvyn Bragg on Read All About It in 1976.Despite everything, I am well and happy and free in a way I have never been before.The 1960s were a thrilling time for O’Brien after the tumult of her divorce. She hosted glamorous parties and socialised with Princess Margaret and Paul McCartney. Admirers included Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum and Marlon Brando. Her success enabled her to buy a townhouse on Carlyle Square in Chelsea.Alongside this, she was publishing hit books almost every year, an exceptional run that continued until 1970. In Ireland she was mocked for her success and she struggled with her feelings about her family and the abuse she had experienced as a child.She began seeing the controversial psychiatrist, RD Laing. In 1970 they took LSD together, an experienceO’Brien describedas “terrifying.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Emory College, GeorgiaSaid he wanted total detachment and total intensity. Wanted me to have several lovers and none. At the end of a fairly hostile copulation said I was just too powerful that he was just a bit of elastic that did not know when he was going to snap.O’Brien’s propensity for difficult men continued. In the late 1970s she began an affair with a senior married British politician whom she nicknamed “Lochinvar”. There were heady assignations in the House of Commons but he would not leave his wife and she could not let go.The scale of her obsession is hard to overstate. She stops writing fiction and devotes thousands of diary pages to her feelings of guilt and longing for his “lovely honey-coloured body”. Friends and even doctors implore her to give him up.The lack of income forced her sell her Chelsea townhouse for £235,000. Within five years it was worth £5m. She would live as a tenant for the rest of her life. Her next books didn’t sell and she came close to suicide.O’Brien once said to me, “I used to think love mattered most to me. It doesn’t. I ask myself now about wars and famines and cruelty and God. I do not believe in God in the same way. I do not.”Her interest in politics had been constant – she had once stood bail for IRA volunteer Dolours Price but her later work, beginning with The House of Splendid Isolation in 1994, made this more overt.Controversy continued but her literary spark had returned: her 2015 novel The Little Red Chairs is considered to be one of her best books.It was a wonderful act of resilience and renewal. O’Brien would continue to write until her death at the age of 93.Blue Road: The Edna O’Brien Storyis released in UK cinemas on 18 AprilExplore more on these topicsEdna O'BrienFictionDocumentary filmsIrelandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The actor chats stunts, space and why she’s hungry for moreFri 11 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTShareMost teenagers rebel against their parents in small ways: sneaking out, stealing a nip of Cointreau, arriving home past curfew. Not Varada Sethu, the Newcastle-raised actor who’s about to grace screens as new companion Belinda Chandra in the forthcoming season ofDoctor Who. Her rebellion took on a go-big-or-go-home attitude befitting a future screen star: when she was 18 she entered, and subsequently won, the Miss Newcastle beauty pageant. “Oh my God, I thought that was gonna be buried somewhere!” she exclaims when I bring it up. The whole thing was “kind of an accident”, she explains: “My sister and I were walking around in Eldon Square shopping centre, and they asked us if we wanted to enter, and I thought: ‘Yeah, I’ll give it a go’ – I thought it might piss off my parents a bit!”The decision to enter definitely caused “a bit of friction”, but Sethu’s parents didn’t raise a quitter. “On the day we had the rehearsals, I called my mum up and said: ‘I don’t want to do this, can you please take me home?’ And Mum was like: ‘Well, you’ve signed up for it, so you’re doing it,’” she recalls. “None of us expected me to win – the whole thing was a bit of a bodge job for me!”Now 32, the beauty pageant world “doesn’t really align with” Sethu’s value system, and her chosen vocation is miles – galaxies, really – away from that world of tiaras and special skills. In recent years, thanks to a starring role in the acclaimed Star Wars series Andor and her forthcoming turn as Belinda, as well as a part in the 2018 BBC drama Hard Sun, she’s become known as a go-to British sci-fi actor. “You don’t often see brown people in space – well, you do more than in other genres, because they’re futuristic – but I don’t think I necessarily saw myself as part of the sci-fi world,” she says. “So I don’t quite know how I ended up here, but I love it, and I’m very, very happy to be here.”View image in fullscreenScreen queen … Sethu as Belinda Chandra in episode two of the new series of Doctor Who.Photograph: James Pardon/BBC Studios/Bad WolfBorn in Kerala, India, Sethu moved with her parents and twin sister to Newcastle upon Tyne when she was six. Her entire family are artistic – her father sings and her mother is a dancer – but “everybody does it as a hobby”, so when she caught the acting bug after doing National Youth Theatre as a teenager, her parents insisted she pursue a veterinary degree as well. After a few months in vet school, she was ready to drop out. “[One day] my dad outright asked me: ‘Are you actually happy?’ and I completely fell apart. I was honest, saying: ‘No, this isn’t what I want to do – I want to follow my dreams, I want to go into acting,’” she says. “My mum thought it was an impulsive decision – she thought that I found uni quite hard and I didn’t want to do it any more, which is, you know, maybe a fair thing to say – I am impulsive!”After Sethu landed a few jobs – including in Russell T Davies’s 2016 TV adaptation of A Midsummer Night’s Dream – her mum came round. “When she saw that I’m able to support myself, [her opinion] changed,” she says. “She’s very much onboard now that she knows it’s what I love doing, and that I’ll find a way to survive.”Sethu’s breakout came in 2022 when she was cast as the medic Cinta Kaz in Andor, a prequel to the acclaimed 2016 Star Wars spin-off Rogue One. Andor has been praised as one of the best Star Wars properties in many years – the franchise has been hampered, of late, by a deluge of tepidly received streaming shows – and Sethu says she “knew that it would do well, because it’s such beautiful writing, it’s so considered and layered and complex”.In the show, Sethu’s character is in a same-sex relationship, still a rarity in mainstream franchises. “It meant a lot to me – I think the best thing about that part was that it wasn’t this huge deal, it was just normalised, nobody bats an eyelid,” she says. “I believe that’s how it should be. Unfortunately, there are certain parts of the world where it’s illegal to be gay or to be queer in any way. It’s a fundamental part of someone, but it’s also so arbitrary, and sadly there’s still a ways to go. So anything that is moving towards highlighting how totally normal and fine it is to be queer, I’m on board with. It meant a lot to have that representation in the Star Wars world as well – the first, I think we were told, openly queer relationship [in Star Wars].”View image in fullscreenHospital pass: Sethu and Ncuti Gatwa in episode one of the new series of Doctor Who.Photograph: James Pardon/BBC Studios/Bad WolfDespite the shows being vastly different, Andor gave Sethu a little bit of experience in terms of shouldering a massive, beloved franchise when it came to stepping into Doctor Who, which she wasn’t a fan of before appearing on the show. In 2023, she filmed a guest spot as a soldier who comes to the aid of the Fifteenth Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa) in the episode Boom, and later that year was asked to take a meeting to be Gatwa’s new companion. “I wasn’t expecting to come back,” she says. “It was amazing to be able to come back, and it was great because it didn’t feel like the first day at school, not knowing anybody – I had already had a little taste of it, and everyone knew me.”Although Sethu is forbidden from revealing too much about Belinda’s arc this season, she liked that “she was able to stand on her own, and she felt very much like the main character in her own story”, she says. “She felt very independent from the Doctor – it really feels like they’re equals.”Working with Gatwa, whose turn as the first non-white Doctor has won rave reviews, was a dream come true. “He’s so talented, and to watch him every day you have to match that energy. I think that’s what was great about us – if one of us was feeling knackered or whatever, the other one pulled our weight,” she says. “I never got sick of [seeing him act] – I’d think: ‘God, I can’t believe I’m getting paid to do this, to watch Ncuti, one of the greatest actors of our time, perform this great piece in front of me.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I don’t want to give a lot away!”In the meantime, Sethu is hoping to pick up roles outside of the sci-fi niche she’s becoming known for. “I’m hungry for more of all of it – drama, comedy, tragedy, all of it. I would love to do something silly, like a fun romcom, or a very, very serious drama,” she says. “The reason I went into acting, or what I love most about acting, is that you get to experience the full spectrum of the human experience – and sometimes outside of it. I love that I’ve been able to explore space without actually having to, you know … go there!”Doctor Who returns12 April, 6.50pm, BBC One.Explore more on these topicsDoctor WhoTelevisionFantasy TVDramainterviewsShareReuse this content"

So it is with the super-rich spa satireThe White Lotus. The gunsmoke is still clearing from the finale of the third season but speculation is rife about where the HBO hit will head next.This week’s climax ofMike White’s drama might have divided critics, but it was still group chat-dominating, column inch-gobbling TV, notching its highest ratings yet. The show was renewed for a fourth trip before the third had even aired, with White reportedly pitching HBO execs his next idea while still filming in Koh Samui. Buzz is now building about the next chapter, expected on our screens in late 2026.View image in fullscreenMike White accepts a Golden Globe for The White Lotus in January 2023.Photograph: Rich Polk/NBC/GettyEach season has unfolded at a luxury resort in a different region. Viewers have been whisked to the Pacific (the debut season in Hawaii), Europe (the Sicily-set sequel) and Asia (the third hotel from hell, filmed in Thailand). White has previously said his dream for the show is to “hit every continent”.If the pattern continues, options are likely to be Africa (there are rumours of a Moroccan riad, Kenyan safari or a sightseeing tour of Egypt), South America (Buenos Aires has been mentioned) or Australia (White has alluded to its “wealth of talent”).A factor is the production’s partnership with Four Seasons, after signing a reported £25m deal in 2021 to film exclusively in the high-end chain’s resorts. Its five-star hotel in Marrakech’s ancient medina has emerged as a frontrunner. White apparently stayed at the Four Seasons Tamarindo in Mexico before Christmas, potentially on a research trip. He is also said to have looked at £1,000-per-night glamping at the Four Seasons in Tanzania’s Serengeti national park.View image in fullscreenThe Juvet Landscape hotel in Norway featured in HBO’s series Succession.Photograph: Juvet LandskapshotellThere is conjecture that after three sun-soaked stories, a cold climate would provide a change of gear. White had been spotted in Norway, making that a strong favourite. Local press reports suggest it nearly happened for season three. There are no Four Seasons sites in Norway, but spectacular alternatives include the Juvet Landscape hotel, which featured in theHBOseries Succession.However, the show’s producer, David Bernad, has hinted this is a longshot, saying: “Mike doesn’t like the cold. He’s a California guy. He’s not built for snow.” For his part, White has teased that the fourth season could move away from beach settings, saying: “I want to get a little bit out of the ‘crashing waves on rocks’ vernacular.”View image in fullscreenMike White is said to have looked at glamping sites at the Four Seasons in Tanzania’s Serengeti national park.Photograph: Richard WaiteTax incentives and subsidies will play a part in the decision, making Japan an attractive proposition. Four Seasons Kyoto or Osaka head the shortlist here. However, there have been calls for the production to stay closer to home. The media union Sag-Aftra wants the fourth season to be shot in California as part of its “stay in LA” initiative.Perhaps the most definitive clue came from HBO’s head of drama, Francesca Orsi, who said in February: “We’re location scouting in the next couple of weeks. I can’t really say where we’re going to land but chances are somewhere in Europe.”View image in fullscreenCould Simona Tabasco from White Lotus season two be in the running?Photograph: Fabio Lovino/APThere are plenty of Four Seasons spots in mainland Europe to choose from, notably Cap-Ferrat in the French Riviera. However, White will not take an obvious path. “Where we choose to go next could be hugely impactful to that destination,” he told the Hollywood Reporter. “That’s why it was so cool to shoot in Thailand. It’s hard to go backward. Doing it in Paris feels like a cop-out.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stick a pin in a list of A-list acting talent. Woody Harrelson came close to being cast in season three as the Bangkok berserker Frank, ultimately played by Sam Rockwell. It was only scheduling conflicts that scuppered Harrelson’s involvement, so he could be high on the hitlist next time. Hollywood names will probably be joined by a scene-stealing British actor or two, with big impressions made by Tom Hollander, Leo Woodall, Jason Isaacs andAimee Lou Woodin previous series.Each season has featured overlapping characters.

The unhappy honeymooners Shane and Rachel from season one (Jake Lacy and Alexandra Daddario) or season two’s sex worker Lucia (Simona Tabasco) could work well.

After De Veer spoke out about creative differences over the latest theme tune, White hit back that this was “a bitch move”.

Initially a photographer, she broke through as a film-maker withCléo from 5 to 7in 1962, and then reinvented herself in her late 70s with art installations that toured the world’s most prestigious contemporary exhibition spaces, from the Venice Biennale to the Los Angeles Museum. Her last film documentaries such as the autobiographicalLes plages d’Agnès(2008) andVisages, Villages(2017) reaped awards worldwide.The elf-looking gamine with her eternal short bob and soft melodious voice showed through her life a formidable determination, imposing herself in a man’s world. Today, Varda is a French monument. So much so that her work is now exhibited for the first time in one of Paris’s most iconic and historic museums, theMusée Carnavalet, dedicated to the history of the French capital.View image in fullscreenArtisan photographer … Agnès Varda, Autoportrait dans son studio, rue Daguerre, Paris 14e, 1956.Photograph: © Succession Agnès VardaAgnès Varda’s Paris, Here and There, which has just opened, focuses on her first profession, that of “artisan photographer”. This small but perfectly formed exhibition displays for the first time Varda’s early photography work and invites the viewer into her Parisian home, a temple to art and friendship.For Varda, photography andPariswere intimately linked. Perhaps because she never left the impasse at 86 Rue Daguerre near Montparnasse, where she lived for almost 70 years. Made of two derelict shops joined by a courtyard alley, Varda transformed this islet of a place into a studio, a playground and a home where clients, family, friends, fellow artists and lovers would constantly cross paths. On first visiting the place in 1951, her father asked if she really wanted to live and work in this ramshackle barn with only a squat toilet in the courtyard. She answered, “I’ll make it work somehow.” And she did.Her Greek father and French mother had fled the German invasion in June 1940 and settled with their five children in the seaside resort of Sète in Languedoc. After Germany occupied the whole ofFrancein late 1942, the family moved to Paris. No more southern light and warmth: “Paris was cold and sad. Germans were everywhere”, she recalled. However, as Paris was liberated in August 1944, a new spirit, one of freedom and unadulterated joy, galvanised the whole country and especially its youth. The 16-year-old Varda enrolled at the Louvre art school and chose to become a photographer. She also legally changed her first name in an act of emancipation: born Arlette, she chose to be known as Agnès.Officially registered with the photographers’ guild at the age of 18, she first lived in Montmartre with her lover, the sculptor Valentine Schlegel, who became one of her first models. The two young women then moved to 86 Rue Daguerre in the 14th arrondissement, after Agnès’s father agreed to help her buy these strange, interconnected boutiques in ruin.View image in fullscreenPassion for people … Varda’s image Rue Mouffetard, Paris 5e, 1957.Photograph: © Succession Agnès VardaThrough Valentine, Varda met the maverick theatre director Jean Vilar. This encounter propelled Varda into the world of avant garde theatre and films. Vilar, who was Valentine’s brother-in-law, was France’s star theatre director whose productions of classics such as Corneille’s Le Cid with heartthrob Gérard Philippe in the title-role attracted the crowds. Vilar believed in popular theatre and, thanks to a deliberate policy of affordable tickets, brought the magic of classics to a working-class public. Served by the most talented young actors from the Paris drama school known as Le Conservatoire, Vilar believed that the working class deserved the best; it was a perfect French case of elitism for all, and it worked. Varda became Vilar’s official photographer, taking portraits of all the actors, and documenting rehearsals and the life of the theatre company, in Paris and on tour.Alongside her professional work, Varda developed her own style, inspired by surrealism. In one of her personal works, she superimposed two negatives, one of the Seine River, another of the sculpted profile of a man, thus creating a strange and unsettling composition called The Drowned Man. She would cultivate this eerily otherness all her life. In her “studio-courtyard” as she called it, she started receiving many young actors looking for a new kind of professional portrait, in natural light, far from the old studio effects of light and shadows, sophisticated poses and makeup.This thirst for spontaneity, naturalness and improvisation permeated all arts in the 1950s. In photography, her colleague Sabine Weiss, but also Willy Ronis and Robert Doisneau, made their mark for their ability to catch life and people in movement. Varda, although not a member of a photographers’ agency like Magnum, shared the same passion for people and freedom. Unlike photo-reporters who went on assignments anywhere in the world, Varda mostly photographed Parisians or visiting artists. In 1954, she dragged Federico Fellini, in Paris to promote his film La Strada, to a demolition site near her, and took pictures of him, half-hidden in trenches of stone debris. He didn’t seem to mind. “He was calm, smiling and patient,” she recalled. She also had the American artist and sculptorAlexander Caldercrossing the street opposite her studio all afternoon carrying his huge mobiles while laughing.View image in fullscreenKeep smiling … sculptor and artist Alexander Calder photographed by Varda in 1954Photograph: © Succession Agnès Varda / 2025 Calder Foundation, New York / ADAGP, ParisNews magazines started commissioning her work. She managed to impose both her stories and her vision, for instance when she followed a girl she had dressed as an angel through the streets of Paris, catching people’s reactions, half-surprised, half suspicious. She used Paris as decor, and sometimes as a character. At the time, the city was dark, its buildings covered with centuries-old grime and soot, and its people, for a large part, of modest origin. In 1957, Varda chose to document the life of Rue Mouffetard in the 5th arrondissement, one of Paris’s oldest streets, snaking down from thePanthéon. Its inhabitants were mostly poor or destitute, living at the fringes of society. Varda shot closeups of their faces, their eyes telling dramatic if not simply sad stories.Her photography inevitably led her to cinema which, in the mid-1950s, stood at a crossroads. Her first long feature film, La Pointe Courte, was filmed in Sète in the summer of 1954, on a shoestring budget, thanks to the generosity of friends such as Alain Resnais, who edited the film for her and Vilar’s actors Philippe Noiret and Sylvia Monfort, who worked for free. Four years before the official birth of the French New Wave, La Pointe Courte announced the changes to come, although very few credited her for it. When her new partner, the film director Jacques Demy, moved in with her at 86 Rue Daguerre in 1959, movies and photography became the two most important things in her life, alongside her daughter Rosalie, born in 1958.Varda was always too original and too curious about life to choose just one medium in which to express herself. Her notebooks, letters, news reports, extracts of her films and home videos, and her photography demonstrate her irresistible enthusiasm for all things eccentric and wondrous. As she said it herself: “I enjoy going here and there. I enjoy saying one thing and its opposite. I feel less trapped that way, because I do not choose just one version of life.”Le Paris d’Agnès Varda is atMusée Carnavalet, Paris, until 24 AugustExplore more on these topicsAgnès VardaPhotographyParisFranceEuropeExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 2025 edition is being viewed by some as an unofficial comeback with headliners Lady Gaga,Green Dayand Post Malone, who together boast 24% higher global Spotify streams than the previous trio.Gaga previously headlined Coachella in 2017, when she also filmed scenes for A Star Is Born. In arecent interview, she said she would focus on her new album, Mayhem, but also give fans the older hits they want. She said she saw it as “an opportunity to do something unique and special” but remained tightlipped about specifics.“I genuinely don’t want to give anything away aboutCoachella,” she said. “I know that is heartless of me, in a way, but I could honestly cry on the phone with you just thinking about how excited I am to do this show, and I want it to be a total surprise, and want everyone to have as much fun as possible.”The lineup boasts a wide variety of acts from different genres and eras. The newer guard is represented by Lola Young, Shaboozey, Amyl and the Sniffers, Rema, underscores and Glorilla, while nostalgia plays are led by Jimmy Eat World,Missy Elliott, Kraftwerk, Basement Jaxx and the Go-Gos.The weekend will also see the Prodigy play, returning to Coachella for the first time sinceKeith Flint died in 2019. “I will say that us carrying on isn’t a Keith tribute show,” band member Liam Howlett recently told theLos Angeles Times. “We want to honor him, and we will continue to do that, because Keith is more than just a person they saw on stage. Even though he wasn’t a musician, he was such an important person in the studio as a right-hand man.”Another throwback act playing is Weezer, a band who have been making headlines this week after bassist Scott Shriner’s wife, Jillian Lauren, was shot by police.Reports claimthat she aimed a handgun at officers as they investigated an unrelated hit-and-run incident and she is now being charged with attempted murder.The band is still set to perform as scheduled with Scottsaying“see you at Coachella” to journalists on Thursday.One act who won’t be performing is FKA twigs, who wasforced to pull out“due to ongoing visa issues” related to her production team reportedly failing to fill out the correct paperwork in time. The star wrote that she was “devastated” in an Instagram statement.Rising costs and more complicated logistics have also caused trouble for other artists seeking visas to perform. “I just did visas for a Coachella band and it was $8,000,” a booking agency executive told theLos Angeles Times. “It’s becoming a huge financial hurdle because it takes so long through regular channels, you have to go for the heavy-duty expediting.”Explore more on these topicsCoachellaLady GagaCharli xcxGreen DayEd SheeranThe ProdigyWeezernewsShareReuse this content"

The film, which competed at the 2024 Berlin film festival and won prizes in Europe and the US, shows the romantic awakening of a woman in Tehran who notably appears without the headscarf that is obligatory for women in Iran.The pair were sentenced to 14 months in prison, suspended for five years, and a fine on charges of “spreading lies with the intention of disturbing public opinion”, Dadban said. In addition, they were sentenced to one year in prison, also suspended for five years, and all equipment ordered confiscated for the charge of “participating in the production of vulgar content”. Another fine was ordered on the charge of “showing a film without a screening licence”, it added.‘We’re charged with propaganda, vulgarity and spreading prostitution’: the directors of My Favourite CakeRead moreThe New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran commented on the verdict, saying: “Artists in Iran endure significant hardships, including increasing censorship, arbitrary detentions and the constant threat of legal repercussions for expressing dissent through their work.”Even before their conviction, Moghaddam and Sanaeeha were banned from leaving Iran to attend the Berlin film festival and then promote the film when it was released in Europe. “We wanted to tell the story of the reality of our lives, which is about those forbidden things like singing, dancing, not wearing hijab at home, which no one does at home,” Moghaddam said earlier this year.News of the verdict came as the Cannes film festival announced that the new movie by another leading director banned from leaving Iran, Jafar Panahi,would be screenedat its 2025 edition. Another recent Iranian film, Mohammad Rasoulof’s The Seed of the Sacred Fig, which explicitly deals with the 2022-23 protest movement, resulted in the director and several of its actors fleeing the country, and those who remained unable to leave and subject to prosecution.Explore more on these topicsFilmIrannewsShareReuse this content"

The 12 dadikwakwa-kwa shell dolls,traditionally usedto teach kinship, literacy, numeracy and about women’s health – have been given by the Indigenous Australian Anindilyakwa community to a UK museum on one condition – that children play with them once a year.The relationship between Europe’s museums and the countries and communities where items were taken from has beenreplete with controversyin recent years. But Manchester Museum cemented a bond with the Anindilyakwa community, the traditional owners of the land and seas of theGroote archipelagoin the Gulf of Carpentaria, off the northern coast of Australia, by returning 174 objects in 2023.The returned items included spears, boomerangs and a number of dadikwakwa-kwa. They had been bought or traded in the 1950s by a social scientist,Peter Worsley, during his anthropology PhD, but the community had not understood the deals as permanent, saidNoeleen Lalara, a senior elder.View image in fullscreenThe exhibition features shell dolls, sculptures of ‘monster fish’, silk scarves and spears made by Indigenous Australian artists.Photograph: Jon Super/The GuardianThe safekeeping and eventual return of the items was of profound significance to the Anindilyakwa community, who number 1,600 people and 14 clans. The items have helped ensure the transfer of wisdom between generations – meaning, in the words of Amethea Mamarika, an emerging Anindilyakwa leader, “young people can follow in the footsteps of our ancestors”.By giving 12 new dadikwakwa-kwa crafted by Anindilyakwa artists toManchesterMuseum, the community is changing the way the university museum tells its stories: these artefacts are not meant to be permanently kept from the curious behind glass.In workshops over the Easter holidays, visitors have signed up to play with the new dadikwakwa-kwa in sand at the museum.View image in fullscreenDadikwakwa-kwa Come Out to Play sessions at the museum require advance booking.Photograph: Jon Super/The GuardianThe dolls form part of a permanent exhibition, Anindilyakwa Arts: Stories from our Country (Alawudawarra yirri-langwa-langwa angalya), created in close collaboration with the community, breaking with historical conventions of telling Indigenous stories through colonial perspectives.Exhibits include “monster fish” sculptures, spears and silk scarves bought by the museum, and an Anindilyakwa dictionary compiled by elders. The result is a collection embodying Anindilyakwa ecology, wisdom and language, the history of their trade routes and civilisation.The dadikwakwa-kwa are considered living entities, carrying the spirits of ancestors and guiding those who interact with them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Before I knew it the sun had long since set and my lounge was lit only by my Steam Deck and a game that had fast become my new obsession. It is the sort of game that feels as though it were made just for you – and the elements that make it truly special are best discovered without forewarning, so forgive any vagueness in what follows.In a similar style toWhat Remains of Edith FinchorGone Home, Blue Prince has you exploring your character’s atmospherically uninhabited family home. But as inOuter Wilds, your exploration is limited: you are frequently forced to start afresh with little more than the snippets of knowledge you’ve gained. Each expedition is further complicated by Rogue-like randomisation: the house’s shapeshifting floor plan is a five-by-nine grid to be filled anew each day with tiles drafted by you, a feature that some players may recognise from the board game Betrayal at House on the Hill. But in this case there’s a random choice of three options whenever you open a door.View image in fullscreenIt’s always worth trying a room you haven’t seen before.Photograph: Raw FuryDifferent rooms serve different functions. Some provide resources such as keys, money, energy or gems (required to draft more interesting rooms), and these are occasionally locked behind relatively simple standalone puzzles. Others deplete your stocks, like the gymnasium that wearies you each time you enter. A few, such as the boiler room or utility closet, offer special features that affect the rest of the house, occasionally even beyond just that day. On every in-game day, you enter the house, draft rooms, and explore until you run out of energy or openable doors. Rinse and repeat.The point? Ostensibly, to fulfil the stipulation laid out in a deceased great uncle’s will to find an elusive 46th room and thereby inherit the estate. But like a parfait dessert, this game is deliciously layered. At first the sprawling house can feel sparse, with its lifeless rooms and the game’s calming cel-shaded art style and succinct sound design and music. You’ll focus on the draft, learning as you go that the further you get from the entrance, the more likely you are to draw rarer rooms; that most rooms can only be drafted once per run; and that it’s always worth trying a room you haven’t seen before even if it doesn’t seem useful in the moment.Before too long, you’ll start to find objects that hint at future discoveries: car keys when you’ve yet to see a car (or even considered venturing outside); notes written by different hands; larger puzzles you have no idea how or why to solve. You’ll scribble down hints and set goals for future runs, or – as I did – take copious screenshots of the letters, photographs and other artefacts found throughout. As the rooms become more familiar, you’ll notice more details and wonder if they’re background art, environmental storytelling, or clues.In another game such repetition could feel tedious, but Blue Prince sets a gently rewarding pace, the randomisation nudging you to try new things and make new discoveries each day. Thoughtful design details smooth your way: most locked doors only require any generic key, the more convoluted puzzles remain solved even when the house resets, the use of discrete energy units consumed when you enter a room – rather than a ticking clock – means you can always take your time. I never felt in danger of not being able to solve a problem, and multiple puzzles ended up having easier solutions than I initially suspected.And then there’s the fact that Blue Prince has the best titular homophone in video games (sorry Fortnite). It’s a game about the blueprints of the Mount Holly Estate, and naturally a magical mansion like this has a story; it’s this, the family behind it, and the fantastical wider world in which they live, that will draw you to the 46th room and far, far beyond.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lan Ping (Gabby Wong) and Li Lin (Millicent Wong), begin working together in the theatre and sharing a home. We follow their trajectory of friendship and betrayals, refracted through seismic events in 20th-century Chinese history.Playwright Amy Ng is also a historian and bases her drama on the “untold true story” of these women, who rise in power and position in communist China. Lan Ping goes from revolutionary actor, who talks of destroying the strictures of patriarchy, to become Chairman Mao’s wife and the architect of the Cultural Revolution. Meanwhile, Li Lin, the daughter of a communist martyr who is later adopted by Mao’s number two, becomes China’s foremost theatre director.View image in fullscreenFateful female friendship … Gabby Wong as Lan Ping, left, and Millicent Wong as Li Lin, right, in Shanghai Dolls at Kiln theatre.Photograph: Marc BrennerIn their early friendship, they pledge never to betray each other but do just that when political ideology, power and ambition gets in the way. The play traces their moving positions toward art, the party and how to survive in it as a woman.Under the direction of Katie Posner, this is as much an ideas play as a drama of a fateful female friendship. Debate dominates with talk of creative independence for artists and whether the Communist party can bring freedom for women or stifle their progress. Lan Ping thinks the latter, and is later politically silenced. Li Lin’s position of absolute faith in the party changes too. Both women have powerful male patrons whom they need to survive, and there is an ongoing discussion around Ibsen’s Nora. In the early scenes especially, they seem like mouthpieces for their political positions and this hampers emotion or intimacy from building.There is a lot of history to digest too; the plot streaks across almost 60 years in 80 minutes. We go from civil war between the Chinese Communist party and the nationalists in the 1930s to wars with Japan, the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, famine and Cultural Revolution. Sometimes it leaves you behind in its welter of names and events. There are jumps through time – the historical backdrop shifts with each scene and with it the women’s lives. It is not always immediately clear what has happened, how it has affected them or who they have become.What helps to adrenalise the story and bring context is Jean Chan’s fluidly moving set and Akhila Krishnan’s video design, with projected illustrations and bursts of colour that bear the aesthetics of a graphic novel and bring visual drama. Nicola T Chang’s electronic music design adds to it, culminating in a spectacular blood red set-piece, with a blaze of sound, light and movement.It ends with real-life footage of the women, which finally brings the emotion that has hitherto been missing. This is a handsome production and it is remarkable that Ng has unearthed the story of this friendship, but for all its colour it leaves emotional gaps.At Kiln theatre, London, until 10 MayExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreKiln theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Rushdie – who in 1989 had a fatwa issued against him by Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini calling for his death, after the publication of his novel The Satanic Verses – was stabbed in his neck, chest, hand and eye.Knife is Rushdie’s memoir of his “near-death” in which he recalls seeing his attacker and thinking to himself: “So it’s you. Here you are.” The attack lasted 27 seconds and, to this day, the author remains bewildered that he didn’t fight back. “Was I so feeble that I couldn’t make the slightest attempt to defend myself?” he asks. As baffling to him is that the man, a Lebanese-American whom he calls “The A” (short for “Assailant” or “Ass”), had never read The Satanic Verses. Instead, he had watched clips of Rushdie lecturing on YouTube and concluded that he was “disingenuous”.A harrowing account of the before, during and after of a violent assault, Knife is given added power and immediacy in being narrated by Rushdie himself. His tone throughout moves between anger, resignation and dry humour. While he is unsparing with the details – for a while his eyeball, which could not be saved, lolled on his cheek like “a large soft-boiled egg” – there are also outpourings of love for his friends, family and his wife, Rachel Eliza Griffiths. The ultimate intention in Knife is to reveal how love triumphs over cruelty and to “answer violence with art”.Available via Penguin Audio, 6hr22minFurther listeningLove in ExileShon Faye, Penguin Audio, 7hr1minAn insightful memoir of one woman’s search for love, the commodification of romance and finding one’s self-worth.

His genre-spanning work has featured collaborations with psychedelic guitarist Santana, jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter and Jamaican singer Buju Banton. OnSo Kono, his first album in seven years, Keita returns with an unusually sparse sound featuring guitar, ngoni, calabash, tama and cello.The joy of the record lies in Keita’s mature voice, huskier now at 75 and settling into a lower, rumbling register that contrasts with his falsetto. On Aboubakrin andTassi, he sings over simple, looped ngoni refrains, his raw vocals carrying poignant emotion. While the percussive layering on Soundiata is somewhat jarring, there are many moments of stripped-back beauty.Kanté Manfilafinds Keita veering from gravelly whispers to yearning yelps, while highlight Proud showcases his incredibly nimble delivery, weaving through the string melody to reach a soaring climax and proving that the Golden Voice is still full of power.Watch the lyric video for Chérie by Salif Keita.Explore more on these topicsSalif KeitaThe Observeralbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

With repeated treatments, the super-wealthy Titans grow ever larger, younger and more estranged from humankind, but Cal is determined not to lose his humanity. Like the best fictional PIs, he doesn’t just care about catching criminals; he does what he can to help those who have been let down by society. His latest case, beginning with the killing of a young woman recently arrived in a run-down seaside town, turns out to involve political as well as personal issues, and is another satisfying, stylish dose of science fictional noir.View image in fullscreenSome Body Like Meby Lucy Lapinska (Gollancz, £20)In this adult SF debut from a children’s author, the end is nigh. Humans, racked by disease and toxic pollution, are facing extinction. But it is not the end of the world. Intelligent androids are working to renew the land and sea, and will remain as thoughtful caretakers of the planet. A new law is set to change their status, granting them equal rights with their former owners. Abigail, built 16 years earlier to replace her owner’s late wife, looks forward to freedom with apprehension. What should she do? What sort of person could she be? She decides to begin by doing something her owner forbade: finding out more about the original Abigail. What, besides housework and pleasing her husband, kept her occupied? Did she have friends? How did she die? A thoughtful and absorbing reflection on memory, mortality, sexuality and what defines a meaningful life.View image in fullscreenCity of All Seasonsby Oliver K Langmead & Aliya Whiteley (Titan, £9.99)Fairharbour is an island city mysteriously stuck in perpetual winter; at the same time, it is also an island city trapped in endless summer. Yet there are corners of the summer-locked city where small patches of snow can be found, and places in the ice-bound city where green shoots push up out of the snow. Jamie and Esther, cousins separated by the inexplicable cataclysm that so changed Fairharbour, belong to the Pike family whose history may provide a clue to what happened. As the story unwinds, it seems they might, together, find the key to healing the split. A surreal and engaging magical fantasy from two talented writers.View image in fullscreenRose/Houseby Arkady Martine (Tor, £16.99)The latest by the Hugo award winner centres on an isolated mansion deep in the Mojave desert, the mysterious masterpiece of a celebrated avant garde architect, uninhabited since his death a year ago. Rose House is haunted by the creepy, controlling AI built into its structure. When an intruder dies, it will not provide access to anyone but the mandated heir, Dr Selene Gisil; whether or not a murder has taken place, Dr Gisil’s help will be needed to solve the mystery. A sharp, clever blend of science fictional gothic and crime, on a smaller scale than Martine’s previous two novels, but not to be missed.View image in fullscreenThe Cat Brideby Charlotte Tierney (Salt, £10.99)Set on Dartmoor in the sweltering summer of 1995, this impressive debut features 16-year-old Lowdy, a fascinatingly unreliable narrator whose situation – recuperating from a mysterious illness, on the run with her Mumma, preparing to look after her dying grandmother in a rundown old house on the grounds of an abandoned zoo – is immediately strange and compelling. Years before, a big cat, a presumed hybrid dubbed “the tynx”, attacked a man, forcing the zoo to close. Mother and daughter have barely arrived when they encounter unfriendly locals. The closure of the zoo was a major blow to tourism, and many believe the tynx, or its offspring, continues to prey on the moor ponies, their livestock and pets. A stunningly evocative, beautifully written gothic novel drawing on myths and fairytales in a devastating depiction of psychological and visceral horrors.Explore more on these topicsBooksScience fiction roundupScience fiction booksFantasy booksHorror booksFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

The 82-year-old former Chilean dictator had backed Margaret Thatcher in the Falklands war and, while the Conservatives were no longer in power, a former prime minister counted as a friend in high places.British police were not interested in kidnap, murder and torture in South America under a junta that had seized power in a coup in 1973. Besides, a former head of state had diplomatic immunity. Or so Pinochet thought, until officers from Scotland Yard, acting on an extradition request from a Spanish judge, turned up at the private clinic where he had undergone a minor back operation.The ensuing legal battle to determine which crimes might be pinned on the old man, under what statute and in which jurisdiction, is one thread of 38 Londres Street by lawyer and authorPhilippe Sands. It is woven around a second story: Walther Rauff was an SS officer who had overseen the development of gas lorries in Nazi-occupied eastern Europe – vehicles customised to murder their mostly Jewish passengers with diverted exhaust fumes. Rauff evaded prosecution at Nuremberg and eventually settled in Patagonia. He was arrested in 1962 and almost extradited to West Germany, but spared by a Chilean supreme court ruling that a 15-year statute of limitations on his crimes had expired.Two unrepentant murderers; two extradition bids; a Chilean connection – the thematic likenesses alone would justify bringing these stories together. But Sands’s achievement is to excavate a deeper intimacy between the cases of Rauff and Pinochet.The book’s title refers to an address in Santiago, a former headquarters of the Socialist party. After Pinochet’s coup, the building was repurposed as a secret detention and torture centre run by the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (Dina). This agency orchestrated repression on an industrial scale, including at a purpose-built concentration camp on an island in the Tierra del Fuego archipelago.A less skilful narrator might have lost the reader in a thicket of legal arguments. That isn’t Sands’s styleTo commit mass murder with a minimum of witnesses was a logistically complex task requiring the discreet transportation of living prisoners and disposal of corpses. Experience in that field is not the kind of thing people boast about. But such knowledge, and the ideological inclination to use it, might be found in the ranks of a particular type of mid-20th century German émigré to South America.In the late 1950s, before Rauff settled in Chile, he lived in Ecuador. Pinochet was at a military academy in Quito. The two men became friends. After the 1973 coup, Rauff boasted in correspondence of high-level contacts in the new military regime. There were persistent rumours that he was working for the Dina, but nothing was proved before his death in 1984.Pinochet died in 2006, in Chile. His lawyers had failed to assert his immunity but, thanks to some political machination between the UK and Chilean governments, the apparently decrepit dictatoravoided extradition to Spainon grounds of medical incapacity. (His health bounced back as soon as he landed on home soil.)Sands follows each twist in the double narrative with an impressive combination of moral clarity and judicious detachment. As in his previous books dealing with related themes – the Nuremberg trials inEast West Street; a Nazi fugitive inThe Ratline– there is personal investment in the story. The author counts members of his own extended family among the victims of the Third Reich and the Pinochet regime.But it is Sands’s expertise in international law, coupled with a natural storyteller’s intuition for structure, that gives his latest book its understated power. A less skilful narrator might have lost the reader in a thicket of legal arguments, or glossed over nuance in pursuit of polemical urgency. That isn’t Sands’s style. His stories have all the more impact for their subtlety. It would be reassuring to think that monstrous criminals can always be known by their conspicuous monstrosity. That isn’t what history shows. It is by doggedly sticking to the trail of evidence that Sands arrives at the unnerving truth of 38 Londres Street, and what that address tells us about atrocity, impunity and justice eroded by the tide of time.38 Londres Street: On Impunity, Pinochet in England and a Nazi in Patagonia by Philippe Sands is published by W&N (£25).

With Deborah calling Ava the C-word “in that angry boomer way” and stitching her up by posting her “dirty panties” to new colleagues, that’s not likely. It’s all the better for our entertainment, though, and we’re rooting for them to pull this off.Hollie RichardsonBeyond Paradise8pm, BBC OneIn textbook cosy-crime fashion, a batch of artisan chocolates have been poisoned, with the three victims being apparently unrelated residents of Shipton Abbott. Detectives Goodman and Williams (Kris Marshall and Zahra Ahmadi) investigate a case that suffers from a short list of suspects, but recovers with a neat howdunnit.

His latest series is an adult animation about the Hussein family. It begins in 2001, which patriarch Rumi is confident will be a good year for the family – this optimism is misplaced. The series is a study in privilege and diasporic desperation, with a dark subtext: despite his best intentions, Rumi’s desire to fit in and prove himself and his family’s loyalty to the US is almost never rewarded. But, as ever, Youssef renders the Husseins’ travails with warmth, comedy and humanity.Prime Video, from Thursday 17 AprilSpinal DestinationView image in fullscreenBackbone … Bree Peters stars as Tessa in Spinal Destination.Photograph: Sara Hewson/U&WOn the face of it, there are more suitable subjects for comedy than sudden paralysis. But this New Zealand series gives it a go, introducing us to Tessa (Bree Peters), a no-nonsense journalist whose sudden disability sees her sent to a spinal unit where she is patronised, pitied and discouraged from believing that her life can ever be truly hers again. However, with the help of alter ego “Walking Tessa”, she’s soon pushing back. It’s a curiosity rather than essential viewing but it deserves credit for looking the unthinkable in the eye and daring to laugh.U&W, out nowThe Glass DomeView image in fullscreenCaptivating … Léonie Vincent in Glaskupan.Photograph: Jonath Mathew/NetflixLejla Ness (Léonie Vincent)is a criminologist who fled her small town for the city at the first opportunity. As this Swedish thriller unfolds, it’s easy to see why: as a child, she was kidnapped and forced to live in a glass box. When a relative dies, she returns – but a short visit threatens to extend when she is informed that another girl has gone missing. Can Lejla and her former police chief partner find the girl and, in doing so, can Lejla come to terms with her own past? It’s a mildly absurd premise but the doom-laden Scandi noir beats are hit with precision.Netflix, from Tuesday 15 AprilGovernment CheeseView image in fullscreenFlying high … David Oyelowo and Louis Cancelmi in Government Cheese.Photograph: Michael Becker/AppleHampton Chambers (David Oyelowo) is a dreamer; a man who won’t let minor inconveniences such as jail or debts to crime families slow his roll. Upon his release from prison, he returns to his home in the San Fernando Valley to find that his family aren’t particularly pleased to see him, despite him having invented a self-sharpening drill that he’s sure will make his fortune. What unfolds is a surreal, mildly hallucinatory fable that feels gratuitously quirky but is carried along by fine performances and an era backdrop (the US in 1969) that raises the stakes for a Black family just about getting by.Apple TV+, from Wednesday 16 Aprilskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Elisa (Denise Gough) allows her young daughter Lucia to sleep over at a new friend’s house, but upon arriving to pick her up, finds everything has changed. The house is now unoccupied, but what has become of her child? What unravels is an interesting exercise in switching sympathies – the hunt for the girl soon becomes an international affair but it turns out Lucia has been taken for a very particular reason.

And everything about this documentary series about the attempted 2000 theft of the Millennium Star diamond from the former Millennium Dome is in its rightful place. The robbers – who look and sound exactly how a gang of London diamond robbers should – now seem breezily cocky about the whole thing (“It was a bit of a piss take, putting it where it was”). As do the Flying Squad cops who foiled their plan. And the whole enterprise is tied together by the inevitable presence of Guy Ritchie as executive producer.Netflix, from Wednesday 16 AprilSlobornView image in fullscreenInfectious … the third series of Sloborn.Photograph: Channel 4This spookily prescient German-Danish drama launched in summer 2020 and depicted an unfolding global pandemic as it affected the fictional North Sea island of the title. While its popularity could have gone either way in the circumstances, it became a hit in Germany and is now into its third season. It’s slow-burning but gripping; suffice to say, the spread of “pigeon flu” has not been kind to the islanders. As we rejoin them, the survivors are considering life on the German mainland after finding their defences breached by a gang of pirates.PHChannel 4, from Friday18 AprilExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe seven best shows to stream this weekTV streamingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s 4.5 hours south of Sydney and three hours from Canberra. I live in tiny Tilba, 15 minutes away, and I go to Narooma most days to teach yoga, swim or walk.It’s known forNarooma Oyster festival(2-5 May 2025), which showcases the famous rock oysters of the far south coast. April and May are my favourite months as the days are sunny and gently warm and the evenings are cool enough to enjoy a fire.FoodView image in fullscreenWatch the sun set over the water from Quarterdeck Narooma.Photograph: Steven WoodburnHospitality group Merivale has a big footprint in Narooma. It owns two restaurants, a fish and chip shop, a pub, a motel and a caravan park. Everyone has their opinion but I think it has hugely benefited the food scene. Its venues lifted the standard and encouraged more tourism.Quarterdeck Naroomais in an ex-oyster grower’s shed and is my go-to restaurant. You can sit outside for sunset over the water. The Polynesian-inspired menu goes deep on local seafood such as oysters, tuna, mussels and kingfish. The beignets (little doughnuts with dulce de leche and soft serve) stay on the dessert menu because they’re so good.View image in fullscreenThe seafood plate at the Narooma Hotel.If it’s not raining,The Oyster Farmers Daughteris a dream outing. We’ll hire a boat fromNarooma Marinaand head across the inlet, tie it up and have a long lunch under the shade of the waterfront casuarina trees. It’s about a 40-minute ride from Narooma on an e-bike, which you can hire fromSouthbound Escapes. There’s live music on Sundays and take-away oysters shucked or unshucked. The wild-caught tiger prawn and guacamole bites are excellent.Narooma Hotelis on a hill and looks out over the inlet. When the fishing boats come in, it’s a real spectacle because they clean the fish and throw the waste to giant stingrays beneath. There’s often seals and pelicans too. The hotel is known for its wood-fired pizza but does high-quality pub food too. The Tuesday lunch special is popular for its half-sized fish and chips for $16 and there’s usually a vegetarian option, such as pumpkin curry.If your accommodation has a kitchen,Mr Bold Catering Comakes extraordinary beef empanadas and take-home meals. I love the curries like butter chicken and aloo gobi. It sells handmade versions of Monte Carlo biscuits, Kingston biscuits and melting moments.Mr Bold Next Dooruses Axil coffee and the barista is one of the best. It’s in the industrial estate so it’s easy to park.Salton the marina is great for breakfast with fantastic coffee, brewed chai, juices, bacon and egg rolls and healthy bowls.Bound to Earth Espressodoes coffee, matcha, smoothies and housemade cakes.Honorbreadis legendary for sourdough and spinach and ricotta rolls with housemade chutney.

People are always amazed at how turquoise the water is.Ringlands Rotary Walkis raw coastline, nothing manicured about it, with a huge fig tree at the end. TheNarooma to Dalmenycycle path is a 21km round-trip that hugs the coast the whole way. It’s mostly flat so it’s good for kids. There’s a netted swimming enclosure at Bar Beach, where seahorses can be spotted, though the net is removed in winter. On Dalmeny headland you can watch surfers or humpback whales (from September to mid-November).Glasshouse Rocksare these huge stone outcrops that emerge from the shoreline on the beach. They’re spectacular. There’s lots of quartz in the rocks around here, it’s quite special.

In winter they do fireside drinks and marshmallow roasting.InspirationView image in fullscreenThe Kinema serves house-made choc-tops.Photograph: Greg Balfour Evans/AlamyThe Kinemais an art deco style cinema. I’d recommend lunch or dinner at the pub then a nostalgic theatre experience. It does house-made choc-tops, with rotating flavours such as turkish delight and pistachio, and toasties with a mix of three award-winning Tilba cheeses. The film programming is contemporary; they show independent films and blockbusters.Nar-Oo-Ma Aboriginal Cultural Tours has a newImpacts of Colonisationtour that’s often fully booked. It’s a boat tour for about 20 people with guest Aboriginal Elders coming on board to tell first-hand stories and answer questions. A chef cooks local seafood and there’s a cultural performance at the end.On a Tuesday afternoon, it’s worth the 40-minute drive to Moruya for the famousSage Farmers Markets(3pm-5.30pm). Its mission is to create a sustainable food economy and food sovereignty for local communities, so you’ll meet some interesting people.AtTilba Market, on Saturday mornings, you can stock up on cheese, fresh produce, eggs, flowers and plants, and snack on French galettes.Narooma Rotary Market(on the fourth Sunday of the month) is a big country market on Narooma oval.NeighbourhoodView image in fullscreenFind live music and market stalls at Tilba festival in July.Photograph: Dean Dampney/Eurobodalla Coast TourismAnyone coming to Narooma has to hit up Central Tilba too.

If the price seems a little eye-watering for something you could easily make at home, there is one thing Meghan got right: our appetite for condiments – from preserves to chilli oils and hot sauces – is bottomless. With the continuing rise of little treat culture, condiments that hover around the £10 mark have become the new“lipstick effect”.Delli, an online retailer for independent brands, has doubled its condiment sales in the past year, with bestsellers including a £10 “croissant butter” and a £6.99 Malaysian Chinese chilli oil. Waitrose reported an 18% rise in condiment sales in the last month, with the Ottolenghi range of green harissa paste (£5) and miso pesto (£4) both up 13%. Marks & Spencer is echoing this uptick in premium condiments, with sales of truffle mayo (£3.25 as opposed to £1.50 for their classic mayo) up 10% on last year. Now a range of “swicy” (sweet and spicy) condiments including gochujang mayo, hot honey sauce and peach and jalapeno relish are in development.View image in fullscreenDelli x Pollen croissant butter.Photograph: Delli“They’re something you can invest in to add great flavour and elevate the simplest of meals,” says Laura Jackson, a self-confessed condiment obsessive and the co-founder ofGlassette. “We’re cost-cutting in other places but spending more on things like condiments. Jo Malone didn’t invent the scented candle, but she very much made it a status symbol, and it’s becoming that way with condiments.”Claire Dinhut, the author ofThe Condiment Book, compares the condiment boom to buying clothes. Instead of cost per wear, she likes to think about cost per eat. “You’re not opening a £10 jar and finishing it in one night, you’re divvying it up,” she says.Social media, and specifically #CondimentTok, is fuelling the trend, with users detailing recent sauce, chutney and pickle hauls and clever ways to put near-empty jars featuring eye-catching illustrations and punchy logos to use. Brooklyn Beckham’sCloud23 hot sauce, which comes in a glass bottle featuring kissing cherubim, has been compared to luxury perfume packaging.View image in fullscreenGoat Rodeo Goods’ bad boy bread and butter picklesPhotograph: Goat Rodeo Goods“People are really thinking about how things look,” says Jackson. “Condiments are what you want to leave out on your kitchen table, on your shelves, and by your cooker for people to see.”Jake Normal, an executive sous-chef atOttolenghi, says part of the appeal is they add big flavour to simple home cooking. “People want to try new things, but they don’t always have the time to invest in sourcing ingredients and making it,” he says. “Condiments can turn the same few ingredients into five different meals with minimal effort.”Dinhut, however, cautions against attaching labels such as “trending”. “We’re talking about condiments from different cultures that perhaps just haven’t been exposed to other countries before,” she says, with chilli oil a prime example. “It’s a big thing now, but it’s a staple in east Asia.”Restaurants are getting in on the condiment boom, selling house-made sauces and dressings – such as Sambal Shiok’s tomato sambal (£10.50), Gymkhana’s peanut and sesame chutney (£7), and Koya’s bitsy chilli oil (£6.50). “It’s not possible for everyone to go out to restaurants and spend lots of money on food, so it’s nice to be able to have that restaurant flavour at home,” says Jackson.But heritage condiment brands are taking note. Jackson points to the 156-year-old food manufacturer Heinz, which has teamed up with the millennial paint brand Lick on a limited editiontomato ketchup shade. Elsewhere, Chopova Lowena, a London-based fashion brand loved by Dua Lipa and Madonna has joined forces with Hellmann’s on a£1,770 handbag complete with pouchdesigned to fit a jar of mayo. Thankfully, that particular condiment still falls at around the £3.50 mark.Explore more on these topicsFoodFood & drink industrySauces and graviesnewsShareReuse this content"

Behold: sunshine, green shoots, cherry blossom, fresh hope and all that good stuff. And, soon, a glut of bank holidays during which we can unveil our factor 50-smeared knees at the seaside and quickly declare that it’s far too hot.But not all British seaside experiences are built the same. Nibbling a Waldorf salad while sipping a glass ofOxney organic English sparklingat the charmingHarry’sat the Gallivant hotel on the East Sussex coast is not remotely similar to scoffing a battered sausage on Blackpool front. Both have their merits, but Harry’s is a far more refined affair, it being a recently restyled and renamed restaurant inside a blissful, bougie boutique hotel. This is a hotel, incidentally, that will create a sort of Famous Five Do Santa Monica seaside experience for you, albeit at a price. Cocktails on the sand dunes? They’ll mix and pack them in flasks, and find you suitable garments to wear, too. A spot of flow yoga before your breakfast ginger shot? Not a problem, madam. Then, later on, dinner atHarry’sby Matthew Harris, once of Bibendum (and, incidentally, brother of Henry ofBouchon Racinefame), for a menu that focuses on the heartier, homelier side of classic French cookery. Terrine de campagne with pistachios, oysters with sauce mignonette, braised rabbit in riesling and St Émilion au chocolat for pudding, that kind of thing.View image in fullscreen‘Generous, crisp-skinned and perfectly cooked’: Harry’s hake with sauce Maltaise.Regular readers will know my thoughts on restaurants inside fancy hotels, and their habitual tyranny of deadly dull, overpriced menus that trap hotel guests who know no better. They’re rarely allowed to fancy something as sating as “lamb chop and chips”; no, they have to be hostage to nine courses of consommé and froth. Harry’s, I stress most emphatically, is not at all like this. First, it is not fussy or stiff, although it is decidedly glamorous, and a bit like a 1950s beach shack given a Soho Farmhouse makeover. Dim, smoky lighting, soft music, tables positioned strategically for maximum privacy, with giant fronds placed between the closer-together ones, so you could be dining next to Tom Cruise and feasibly not even suss.We began with a plate of smoked eel and a soft, runny boiled egg perched on the plate alongside an assertively mustardy celeriac remoulade. We also ordered that old-school favourite, the Waldorf salad, made with apple, grapes, celery and walnuts, which has become something of a joke in recent times, and possibly why it’s so rarely seen on menus these days. In fact, it’s almost impossible to eat one – especially one served out of a silver sundae bowl and decorated with a delicate parmesan crisp – and not feel as if you’re Wallis Simpson. Those two starters, along with a round of oysters, were pretty much faultless.View image in fullscreen‘Impossible to eat without feeling as if you’re Wallis Simpson’: Harry’s Waldorf salad.Next up, a generous slab of hake with crisp skin and perfectly cooked flesh on what looked like a mermaid’s seat of monks beard and pine nuts, and dressed with an orange segment-flecked sauce Maltaise (that’s a hollandaise made with orange for anyone not au fait with French classic cookery, though it will be impossible to remain so by the time you leave Harry’s). This restaurant calmly serves precise, timeworn recipes using techniques dating from Escoffier onwards, but without making a huge song and dance about it. No one talked us through the dishes at any great length, or demanded that we pay due homage to the chef’s prowess. Quite the opposite: plates were delivered to our table with a cheery “Bon appetit!”, as if they were just serving cod and chips.Even so, when a humble Barnsley chop comes with a good, fresh, rich hazelnut pesto, you know you’re not really in a place that’s truly casual. A side of champ could perhaps have been more buttery and the sauteed spinach was forgettable, but both were more than made up for by a slice of another much-ignored classic, St Émilion au chocolat, which is what happens when amaretti biscuits are soaked in sherry, topped with a rich chocolate cream and chilled for many, many hours, so the boozy biscuits and cream meld together into something that’s truly majestic.View image in fullscreen‘Truly majestic’: Harry’s St Émilion au chocolat.This was a startlingly good dinner, and it was lovely to get some sand between my toes and remember that there is a world out there beyond the radiator, the hot-water bottle and the seasonal affective disorder lamp.

Should you? And, if so, which ones go together?What to drink with your Easter eggsHannah CrosbieFri 11 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTShareThe Guardian’s journalism is independent.

When chocolate is necessary, so is a wine that cleanses the palate, to drink alongside and to complement its flavours.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Chocolate is one of those foodstuffs that really coats the palate, which can make it difficult to enjoy anything much else; its sweetness can also ramp up the perceived bitterness, alcohol and acidity in a wine, and make it taste disagreeable. And it’s those factors that make people think chocolate is rather limited in terms of wine-pairing options.“The myth of chocolate being a hard pairing is crazy,” says Penny Vine, assistant head sommelier atthe Clove Clubin London, a restaurant known for its imaginative pairings. “It works well with about half a dozen things, but not much more than that, and, because you’re limited on choice, it’s actually really easy to pair.”We are, of course, talking mostly sweet wines here: sauternes, madeira, muscat, tokaji, sweeter rieslings – pick your poison. For dark, bitter chocolate, a deep, rich red is often recommended, because those fresh vegetal notes work with the coolness of the chocolate. Vine also has an unexpected failsafe in her sommelier arsenal: a blanc de noirs champagne (meaning white from black), made with the black champagne grapes pinot noir and pinot meunier. “Not all of them work, though,” she warns. “You need the really vinous, ripe-fruit styles that have the richness of red fruit character and enough creaminess and weight. It’s a failsafe, because it’s not just delicious on its own, it helps a chocolate dish to be delicious as well.” For creamy, milky white chocolate, meanwhile, a demi-sec champagne would also work well, something low acid but with a breadth of flavour (Sainsbury’s hasa good own-label one).And, of course, there’s port, which can be paired well with chocolate in pretty much all of its forms. It’s a classic for a reason. Styles will obviously differ from house to house, but the darker a chocolate, the more intense the port needs to be. Think ruby with milk andLBVwith something darker.Or, if you want to leave out the guesswork completely (or are of the opinion that it shouldn’t just be the kids who get chocolate crucifixion gifts), I recently came across Taylor’s nifty little gift set at aMentzendorfftasting, featuring four ports and four chocolates: Fonseca Bin 27 with 70% dark chocolate, 2019 LBV with 58%, 10-year-old tawny with milk chocolate, and dry white port with white chocolate. I don’t have kids, but consuming this in its entirety while a particularly fiendish egg hunt ensues is definitely something I see in my future.Four bottles to drink with your Easter eggsSamos Vin Doux Greece 75cl£10 Waitrose, 15%.

It’s simple. Just chill!Ravneet GillFri 11 Apr 2025 03.11 EDTLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2025 11.01 EDTShareThis is my take on the viral sensation originally created by Dubai-based chocolatier Sarah Hamouda, founder ofFix Dessert Chocolatier. Her ingenious bar, filled with crunchykataifipastry and a luscious pistachio cream, took the internet by storm with its well-balanced flavour combination and addictive texture. I’ve skipped ready-made pistachio cream in favour of a homemade blend, which is free from artificial colours and flavours, and if you can’t find kataifi pastry (it’s normally available fresh in international supermarkets), Shredded Wheat makes an excellent substitute. The result is a luxurious, crunchy treat that’s perfect for sharing – it stores well, too.Crunchy pistachio chocolate barView image in fullscreenPrep10 minCook1 hrChill3 hr 30 min+Makes1 largebar, to serve 6Use the best-quality chocolate you can get your hands on. You will need a deep,two-piece silicone chocolate bar mould.75g kataifi pastry, or Shredded Wheat180g dark chocolate, or milk chocolate, if you prefer, chopped10g coconut oil60g pistachios, shelled180g white chocolate, choppedA large pinch ofsea salt30g tahiniRoughly chop the pastry into small pieces, then transfer to a baking tray in an even single layer. Bake at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for 35 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes, until golden all over, then remove and leave to cool.Put the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water, and heat gently until it’s nearly melted. Add the coconut oil, then take off the heat and stir until fully melted. Set aside to cool slightly.For the filling, blend the pistachios in a food processor until clumpy and just starting to release their oils (you don’t want a paste, though).Put the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of gently simmering water until nearly melted. Take off the heat, stir until fully melted, then mix in in the salt, tahini and pistachios. Mix until it turns green and homogeneous, then stir in the crisp pastry.To assemble, use three-quarters of the melted dark chocolate to coat the inside of a deep two-piece silicone chocolate bar mould, making sure that it is filled deeply enough that the bar will be stable. Put the mould in the fridge for 20–30 minutes, until the chocolate looks dull and set.Spoon the pistachio filling into the mould, leaving a small gap at the top, then return it to the fridge for an hour.Melt the remaining chocolate again, if necessary, then pour it all over the filling, levelling the top with a spatula to neaten and seal. Refrigerate for at least two hours, or overnight, until fully set, then carefully unmould. Keep refrigerated and consume within a few days. The bar should be served cold, because the chocolate is not tempered.Explore more on these topicsEasterThe sweet spotMiddle Eastern food and drinkBakingFoodPastryDessertSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"
