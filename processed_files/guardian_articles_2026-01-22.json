They pumped their little legs furiously but did not make it far in the squelching mud, and were quickly chased back inside, grinning and joking to their friends in Bosnian as another guard scolded them, his rifle swinging by his side while he wagged his finger.Their mothers, foreigners who travelled to Syria to allegedly joinIslamic State(IS) and its blood-soaked caliphate, stood silently behind them. Each had their belongings packed in a bag beside them, ready to leave at a moment’s notice.View image in fullscreenMany children being held in the camp have been there since infancy because their parents were suspected of involvement with Islamic State.Photograph: William Christou/The GuardianSince 2019, life inside al-Hawl, the vast detention facility in the remote Syrian desert which holds at least 24,000 suspected members of IS from 42 different countries, has stood nightmarishly still. But on Monday, time at this vast prison camp lurched back into motion, dizzyingly fast.Camp residents watched in amazement on Monday afternoon as their Kurdish prison guards suddenly disappeared and then hours later, fighters they had never seen before showed up.Syria mapAl-Hawl was now controlled by Syria’s new government in Damascus, the fighters told residents as crowds gathered at the camp’s gates to hear what their new prison guards had to say.Syrian government forces took charge of the camp on Tuesday, as well as prisons housing alleged IS fighters, as they swept through north-east Syria wresting control of more than half of the territory, which for the last decade has been commanded by Kurdish forces. A fragile ceasefire between the government and separatist Kurdish forces ended on Saturday night, and Damascus appears determined to extend its control over the entire country, whether through negotiations or by force.The world watched nervously, unsure of how well the new government, just over a year old and led by former jihadist fighters, would handle the world’s largest IS prison camp of its kind.View image in fullscreenThe camp had long been an anathema to the rebel group which now runs the Syrian government.Photograph: William Christou/The GuardianThe Syrian government inherited a place in chaos. As the Kurds withdrew, the women and children held in the foreigners’ annexe of al-Hawl began their bid to escape, cutting the wiring of the fence surrounding their tents. In the section of the camp holding Syrians and Iraqis residents began to riot, setting a bakery alight as they protested for their release.Syria’s interior ministry created a security cordon around the camp as people with relatives inside headed en masse to the gates, hoping to see their loved ones after years of isolation. NGOs that supplied the camp with basic goods and medical services withdrew along with the prison guards.“We haven’t had bread in the camps for two days. Today there is no water,” said Um Mohammed, a 38-year-old camp resident originally from Idlib, north-west Syria, through the fence. Standing next to her was her 10-year-old daughter, who first entered al-Hawl when she was two years old.“The situation is very bad and has descended into chaos. There needs to be a plan in place,” said Jihan Hanan, the director of al-Hawl camp. She left the camp along with Kurdish forces and is thinking of seeking asylum abroad, afraid for her safety amid the reports of IS members escaping from camps and prisons in the region. The market had mostly run empty, leaving residents tense and afraid. They crowded the gates of the camp, appealing to a silent row of riot gear-clad police to let them out, black smoke billowing from the burning bakery behind them.“We welcome the Syrian government, but they should open the camp gates. We want to see our families, it’s been so long,” said Um Mohammed.View image in fullscreenAl-Hawl has morphed into a semi-permanent city, and human rights groups have said that people there are subject to inhumane conditions.Photograph: Omar Haj Kadour/AFP/Getty ImagesAl-Hawl was meant to be a temporary solution, a place to house people living under IS rule as Kurdish and international coalition forces defeated the extremist group’s so-called caliphate. But dealing with the approximately 75,000 people who came out of the caliphate proved difficult, and soon canvas turned to steel and the displacement camp became a semi-permanent city.Residents languished in conditions described as inhumane by rights groups, with no access to due process and with no end in sight to their detention. For years, observers warned that the camp was a gross human rights violation, particularly since many of the camp’s residents were children, and that the international community must move to deal with the problem before it was too late. Many of the Syrian camp residents have no connection to IS, but were living in the areas they controlled and were displaced by fighting between the extremist group and the international coalition.Syria’s civil war meant releasing Syrians and Iraqis who had tenuous links to IS was a slow process. Other countries mostly washed their hands of their citizens stuck in north-east Syria. Some, such as the UK in the case of the then teenager Shamima Begum,stripped them of their citizenship, others simply left them to their fate in the Syrian desert.Syria’s government insists it will safeguard those inside and prevent any of the camp’s residents from escaping. It has coordinated with the International Coalition, a US-led international force that supported the Kurdish fighters in their fight against IS,on how to run the camp, and is appealing to international organisations to return and restart essential services there.It will also probably accelerate the process of releasing Syrian and Iraqi individuals in the camp who do not have substantive evidence against them.View image in fullscreenWomen gathered at the gates after Syrian government forces took over the patrolling of the camp. Many have demanded they be released.Photograph: Khalil Ashawi/ReutersThe task ahead is daunting, particularly as the prospect of a renewed offensive against the Kurdish authorities looms. If the Damascus government succeeds in taking over further territory, it would place it in control of prisons housing hardened IS fighters and detention facilities holding minors who were brought to IS territory as children. The International Coalition said on Wednesday it would move more than 7,000 individuals with IS links to Iraq, seemingly in anticipation of Damascus advancing further into north-east Syria.Most challenging will be dealing with the foreign residents of al-Hawl, who analysts and humanitarians say are the most extremist residents of the camps. The Kurdish authorities said foreign women worked to perpetuate IS ideology and raise their children to be the new generation of IS fighters.“Are those cigarettes in your pocket, do you drink [alcohol]?” a young teenager asks a Syrian government soldier guarding the foreigners’ annexe. “We just got rid of the Kurds, and now you’re not even Muslims?” Another child, Ali, of Turkmen origin, said his dream was to “go to war” once he got out of the camp.Other children were quieter, with one Azerbaijani child asking Syrian government soldiers when he could see his brother, who he said had been separated from the family and sent to another detention camp.View image in fullscreenAl-Hawl in north-east Syria.Photograph: Izz Aldien Alqasem/Anadolu/Getty Images“I get it, if I had been stuck in this camp for years, I would also want to escape. They were oppressed here. Their countries have to take them back,” said a Syrian security force officer after chasing a group of women back into the fenced-off tent city and foiling another escape attempt. He seemed overwhelmed by the children and their frequent escape attempts, more used to battle than scolding the giggling youngsters who were running rings around him.Al-Hawl had long been an anathema among members of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist rebel group whose former leaders now form Syria’s government. It was seen as a great injustice and featured large in the imagination among the members of the group, some of whom knew detainees inside.Security forces around the camp expressed sympathy for the detainees, not for their alleged connection with IS, but rather their indefinite detention. Even so, rows of security officers marched around the camp, eager to show they were up to the task of securing its perimeter.Amid the chaos, a few Turkmen children stood patiently on the edge of the foreigners’ annexe, their backpacks stuffed with their belongings. Despite a gaping hole in the fence in front of them, they did not move. “They are waiting to be smuggled out,” a security officer said, as the children stared past the fence.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIslamic StateMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We round up the best of this oddly resilient subgenreByRyan GilbeyThu 22 Jan 2026 10.45 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 10.51 ESTShare20. Stork Day (2004)An Italian-Spanish remake of Groundhog Day, with a cynical nature presenter doomed to repeat the same 24 hours while reporting on a stork colony in the Canary Islands. The best thing about it is the Italian title: È già ieri (It’s Already Yesterday).19. The Incredible Shrinking Wknd (2019)It’s Groundhog Day. Again. Except now the repeated days lose an hour with each revolution, introducing a crucial flicker of urgency. A Spanish holiday becomes agonisingly protracted for Alba (Iria del Rio), who uses the loop in which she finds herself stuck to maximise her life, starting with ditching the boyfriend who was about to dumpher.18.Source Code(2011)View image in fullscreenRepeat chance … Jake Gyllenhaal in Source Code.Photograph: Optimum Releasing/Sportsphoto/AllstarInserted into the mind of a man who perished in a bomb blast on a train, Jake Gyllenhaal must relive repeatedly the eight minutes before the explosion until he discovers the bomber’s identity. Some nice in-jokes (Scott Bakula, star of the time-travel series Quantum Leap, has a voice cameo; a ringtone plays Chesney Hawkes’s The One and Only) can’t disguise the fact that suspense tends to suffer when the world can be endlessly rebooted.17.Looper(2012)One of the pitfalls of the time-loop movie as thriller rather than comedy is that exposition can easily overwhelm characterisation. That’s the case in Rian Johnson’s futuristic fantasy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis as two iterations of the same “looper” – that is, a hitman paid to kill and dispose of enemies sent back in time by a crime syndicate. Over-fussy explanatory narration gets in the way, but it’s fun to hear Mob boss Jeff Daniels critiquing the hero’s retro wardrobe. “The movies you’re dressing like are just copying other movies,” he tells him. “Do something new.” Is he talking to the film-makers?16. Before I Fall (2017)A high-school student joins in with viciously humiliating the class misfit at a Valentine’s Day party. Once her life resets after a car accident, though, she endures endless identical versions of that day – including a class on Sisyphus (who is also referenced in othertime-loop movies including Triangleand The Map of Tiny Perfect Things). There are the usual dawning frustrations typical of the time-loop format – “Grounded? I’m already grounded!” she rages, when faced with the go-to parental punishment – before she learns not to be a despicable bully after all. Aww.15.The Map of Tiny Perfect Things(2021)View image in fullscreenHigh on cuteness … Kyle Allen and Kathryn Newton in The Map of Tiny Perfect Things.Photograph: Dan Anderson/Amazon StudiosHappy-go-lucky teen Kyle Allen is already stuck in the same day when a young woman (Kathryn Newton) crosses his path for the first time. Turns out she shares his predicament, but has poignant reasons for never wanting it to end. Together they embark on a project to map out all the overlooked moments of beauty in their small town. High on cuteness, this YA-inflected comedy-drama piles on references to Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow, Doctor Who and Time Bandits (which also centres on a map), but never quite establishes its own identity.14. Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer (1984)The time loop forms only a minor initial part of this anime sequel, which departs inventively from the original manga on which it is based. It earns a place here nevertheless for unbridled imaginative delirium. A group of school friends, having twigged that their days are repeating, zoom off into space and discover that their city is being borne on the shell of a colossal turtle. Standard.13.Happy Death Day(2017)View image in fullscreenDeath by broken bong … Jessica Rothe in Happy Death Day.Photograph: Patti Perret/Universal/AllstarIn a nifty touch, the opening Universal logo glitches and restarts. We then follow a college party girl (Jessica Rothe) repeatedly reliving her birthday, which ends each time with her murder; methods include stabbing, bludgeoning, drowning and death by broken bong. Now it’s up to her to catch her own killer. Groundhog slay, in other words; that comedy gets a mention when Tree’s new beau, aBill Murraynut, expresses dismay that she hasn’t seen it. The 2019 sequel (Happy Death Day 2U) was a repetition too far.12. Mondays: See You ‘This’ Week! (2022)Splat! An unfortunate pigeon collides with the window of a high-rise Tokyo advertising agency – but when it keeps happening, the employees realise they’re stuck in a time loop. Exempt from this knowledge is their boss, whom they must convince (their PowerPoint presentation to him is a highlight) before the loop can be broken. Ryō Takebayashi’s workplace comedy sneaks a few jibes at corporate culture into its madcap format, and hinges on a poetic touch: the secret to escaping the loop turns out to lie within a beautiful unfinished manga.11.Palm Springs(2020)View image in fullscreenRelatable … Cristin Milioti and Andy Samberg in Palm Springs.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyLike The Map of Tiny Perfect Things, this adopts Groundhog Day writer Danny Rubin’s original, rejected idea of beginning the story with the time loop already under way. Andy Samberg is the carefree wedding guest stalked by crossbow-wielding JK Simmons, who is now sore for all eternity after being dragged into the loop with him. Amid the gory comic violence, there is a serious point: “What we do to other people matters … We have to deal with the things we do.” Dropping during the first Covid lockdown only made the film more relatable.View image in fullscreen‘The only hope was time’ … Davos Hanich in La Jetée.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Alamy10.La Jetée(1962)“The human race was doomed. Space was off limits. The only hope was time.” Chris Marker’s half-hour short comprises a series of still photographs and a single briefly moving image, as a dispassionate narrator explains how a post-apocalyptic time traveller is haunted by the childhood memory of seeing a man die at Orly airport. Spoiler alert: it was his own death he witnessed all along. Remade by Terry Gilliam as 12 Monkeys.9.Edge of Tomorrow(2014)Groundhog melee: the time loop hits the battlefield, with backroom boy Tom Cruise forced to become cannon fodder in a war against marauding alien beasties. He soon kicks the bucket, only to wake up again in the first of an endless series of loops, armed each time with fractionally greater knowledge of the enemy. It descends into homogeneous thrashing combat for the last half hour. Until then, it’s quite a ride, with Cruise happy to be repeatedly annihilated and to play second fiddle to co-star Emily Blunt in the action-hero stakes.8. 12:01PM (1990)Adapted from Richard A Lupoff’s short story, this Oscar-nominated short begins with a businessman (Kurtwood Smith) already reliving his lunch-break for the umpteenth time before the hour resets yet again. During several of these endless lunchtimes, he manages to reach a scientist who has made predictions about time loops. The prevalent note, though, is futility: the short ends, boldly and bleakly, with the marooned hero trapped for ever. Later expanded into the crummy 1993 TV movie 12:01.7.The Terminator(1984)A revolutionary leader fighting a future war against malign AI and its robot minions sends his father back in time to save his mother from a remorseless killing machine so that she can, in turn, get pregnant and give birth to him. That baby will then grow up to be a revolutionary leader fighting a future war against malign AI and its robot minions, and can send his father back to …woahhh.6.Céline and Julie Go Boating(1974)View image in fullscreenLoopy … Dominique Labourier and Juliet Berto in Céline and Julie Go Boating.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/AlamyJacques Rivette’s freewheeling Parisian fantasy is loopy in both senses. A pair of loose-goosey chums – one a magician (Juliet Berto), the other a librarian (Dominique Labourier) – run amok in Montmartre. They return repeatedly to a mansion where a sinister Jamesian melodrama revolving around the murder of a child is being re-enacted on a loop. By sucking on a magic sweet, the pals can first observe and then participate in the intrigue, taking the role of the child’s nurse and intervening to avert catastrophe: “We must save the kid at all costs!”5.Triangle(2009)Harassed single mother Melissa George takes a yachting trip with friends, only for a freak storm to hit, forcing them all to clamber on board a passing cruise liner where a serial killer appears to be the sole passenger. That’s the good news. The bad? Events are stuck in an endlessly repeating pattern that turns this into the world’s first maritime-loop movie. Unforgettable images depict the detritus from previous revolutions of the loop: piles of identical discarded sweetheart lockets, handwritten warnings from the past à laMemento, and, shockingly, multiples of the same corpse being pecked at by nonchalant seagulls.4. Je T’Aime, Je T’Aime (1968)View image in fullscreenAccessible, tender … Claude Rich in Je t’aime, Je t’aime.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyA shipping clerk who survives a suicide attempt agrees to take a trip through time: scientists will send him exactly one year into the past, courtesy of a time machine that resembles a giant pumpkin, and then bring him back after just one minute. The retrieval mission doesn’t go according to plan, however, and the woebegone soul bounces between fragments – some repeated, and none in chronological order – of the failed relationship that drove him to despair. Director Alain Resnais had already engaged in temporal jiggery-pokery withLast Year at Marienbadbut this is a more accessible and tender work, as well as a defining influence on Michel Gondry’s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Science of Sleep.3. Groundhog Day for a Black Man (2016)Director Cynthia Kao feeds four minutes of grimly comic social commentary into the Groundhog Day format. Like Bill Murray in that film, the protagonist here (played by Burl Moseley) is woken each morning by Sonny & Cher’s I Got You Babe. But, being Black, he finds each day truncated in the same fashion: no matter how placatory and unthreatening he is, he ends up shot dead by a white cop. The horror is expertly leavened with prop gags (a lobster costume, a lemon meringue pie) and the payoff is suitably sobering. The curiously similar 2020 Netflix short Two Distant Strangers went on to win an Oscar, and to attract accusations of plagiarism.2.The Clock(2010)A video installation on the theme of time, Christian Marclay’s clockwork masterwork is a rolling 24-hour collage of film clips in a literal loop, with no beginning and no end. Tied to whichever time zone it is being shown, The Clock also doubles as an actual timepiece: when the town hall clock on screen in Back to the Future shows 10:04pm, that’s the time in real life; and when Heather Langenkamp in A Nightmare on Elm Street sings “nine, 10, never sleep again”, there is no need to check your watch: it really is 9:10pm. The integrity is weakened by snatches of television clips (including ER and the Ricky Gervais sitcom Extras) but for the most part this is a hypnotic work of genius. Make sure you’re there at 6am for the megamix of fragments from Groundhog Day, What About Bob?, Good Morning Vietnam and Fright Night.1.Groundhog Day(1993)Never equalled … watch a trailer for Groundhog Day“That’s right, woodchuck-chuckers, it’s…Groundhog Day!” Wander through the history of the time-loop movie and you always end up looping back to Harold Ramis and Danny Rubin’s miraculous fusion of formalist experiment and mainstream high-jinks. Bill Murray is at his unsavoury best as the misanthropic weatherman who can’t wait for his jaunt to the Groundhog Day festivities in folksy Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to be over. He may be done with 2 February, however, but 2 February isn’t done with him. Precisely how long he is stuck in that day is never specified. “For me, it had to be … A hundred years,” said Rubin. “A lifetime.” But the script’s total absence of explanations is one of its most radical qualities. Hats off to the film-makers for resisting pressure to blame the time loop on a spurned lover’s curse or a black hole.Adored by everyone from David O Russell and Monty Python polymath Terry Jones to Turner prize-winning artist Gillian Wearing, Bridget Jones director Sharon Maguire and even Mad Max creator George Miller, Groundhog Day has spawned a stage musical, a VR game, an Italian remake and innumerable imitations. (The best is Natasha Lyonne’s ingenious series Russian Doll.) For all that, it has never been equalled – or, thank goodness, sequelled.The new edition ofGroundhog Day: BFI Film Classicsby Ryan Gilbey is published by BloomsburyExplore more on these topicsRankedDrama filmsAction and adventure filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsBill MurrayfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But that didn’t stop many claiming to make sense of itThu 22 Jan 2026 10.11 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 16.02 ESTShareIn weeks like this, the mask slips somewhat. Politicians love the illusion of control. It’s the special power that differentiates them from us lower orders. They are the ones pulling all the levers. Nothing ever happens that takes them unawares. They are the ones with answers to everything. They need it to be this way. Not just for their own psyches but for ours. It’s somehow comforting.And then along comesDonald Trumpand our emperors have no clothes. Their limitations on view to everyone. Scrabbling around just to stand still. Trying to make sense of the world in real time, just like the rest of us. Making it up as they go along.To be fair, there is no shame in this. Their real crime is to pretend they know what they are doing the rest of the time. Let’s face it: The Donald doesn’t know what The Donald is going to do or say from one day to the next, so it’s hardly likely that anyone else will. He isn’t even sure ifGreenlandis Iceland. Hell, they’ve both got land in them. Watch out, England. The only certainty is uncertainty, much as politicians wish it were otherwise.It’s been quite the few days. At the weekend the US president was threatening the UK and seven other European countries with tariffs for sending troops to Greenland, a few days after he had demanded Nato countries send troops to Greenland. Go figure. There may be a mind somewhere in Trump’s brain but it’s been scrambled. The synapses haven’t met in years. There’s life, Jim, but not as we know it.Trump paints himself as great white hope in racism-drenched Davos speechRead moreThen The Donald threatened a military invasion and started posting mock-ups of Greenland and Canada as US states, while trash-talking his Nato allies. Ina hard-to-follow, borderline psychotic speech at Davos, he then said he wouldn’t take Greenland by force but he still wanted to buy it and he wouldn’t forget who had tried to stop him.Then, just as world leaders were trying to catch their breath and work out all the angles, late on Wednesday he popped up on social media to say he had had a meeting with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, and everything was now cool. He didn’t want to annex Greenland after all, as they had come to a deal. Probably the very best deal in the whole history of deals. Certainly the best deal since the last deal that Trump has done. Better even thanending the eight wars that he hasn’t ended.Cue much surprise and chaos as politicians tried to make sense of a global order that was being rewritten in real time. Everyone eager to get the best hot take. Some, mostly American, claimed it as a triumph for Trump. The Art of the Deal made flesh. Go in hard, disrupt and sucker your opponents into giving you what you had always wanted. Others called it classicTaco. Trump Always Chickens Out. The president had gone to the brink and then blinked when he couldn’t get his own way.Come Thursday morning in the UK, it was the foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, who was sent out on the media round to explain it all from the government’s insider position. On the Today programme, Amol Rajan got straight to the point. What had been agreed? There was a long pause. Far longer than the two-second delay on communications from Davos. Er … it had been the result of determined diplomacy. An unwavering adherence to the highest principles. Nato working at its best.Rajan sounded understandably confused. Please remind our listeners, he said: what exactly was the deal again? Again a lengthy pause. Determined diplomacy. An unwavering adherence to the highest principles. Nato working at its best. At which point, the penny dropped. Yvette didn’t have any more idea what the deal was than the rest of us. She was completely in the dark.It could be anything or nothing. Rutte might just have reminded the president that under a 1951 treaty he was already entitled to have US sovereign bases on Greenland along with some mineral rights. Marco Rubio might have persuaded Trump to back downafter falls in the stock market. Or Trump might just have got bored with Greenland. He had concentrated on it for nearly five days, which was already way beyond his mental capacity. He was on to the next thing. Hey, Greenland was no place for a summer vacation.Then Cooper hit her groove. She could put her own spin on the vacuum of knowledge. We shouldn’t worry too much about what the deal was. After all, in Trumpworld any deal could be ripped up in days. I mean, having a vague outline of a deal was, on balance, better than not having a vague outline of a deal. But let’s keep things in the day. Or hour.UK not ready to sign up to Donald Trump’s ‘board of peace’, says Yvette CooperRead moreWhat we really needed to understand was that, if there was a vague deal, it was all down to Keir Starmer. It had been Keir’s steadfast support for the sovereignty of Greenland that had shifted the dial. Brilliant. Because there wasn’t anyone around who would contradict that. In a world of relative truths, where there are any number of realities, there was a parallel universe in which Keir was the ultimate Trump whisperer. And no, we weren’t about to be dragged in to The Donald’s latest distraction. Have you seen some of the undesirableson the “board of peace”? she asked Sky News. We did have principles. Good to know.Over in Davos, there was one other UK politician giving his reaction to the Greenland deal or no deal. Step forward Nigel Farage, who was giving an interview to Bloomberg first thing in the morning. Nige knew even less than most, though that wasn’t going to stop him pretending he did. “Mark Carney has been wrong about everything,” he said.That’s odd, replied the interviewer, Stephanie Flanders. Because everyone else reckons the Canadian prime minister has played a blinder. Telling it as it is. That as long as Trump is in the White House we can no longer count on international law and a united Nato. Nige shrugged. What the past week had shown was a fragmentation into national interests. Weird. Most of us had seen a more or less united Europe. Almost as if the Reform leader was enjoying being wilfully wrong. There again, the only contributions Farage has admitted enjoying at Davos over the years were those of Trump and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. So he was in good company.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe politics sketchGreenlandcommentShareReuse this content"

But Beryl Cook saw something else in all the drizzle and grey of this damp old country: she saw joy.The thing is, joy doesn’t carry the same critical, conceptual heft in art circles as more serious subjects, so Cook has always been a bit brushed off by the art crowd. They saw her as postcards and posters for the unwashed, uncultured masses, not high art for the high-minded. But she didn’t care: she succeeded as a self-taught documenter of English life despite any disdain she might have encountered. And now, on what would have been her 100th birthday, her home town ofPlymouthis throwing her a big celebratory bash.Cook ran a guesthouse on the Hoe, the city’s historic waterfront district, and in the 1970s filled it to bursting with paintings. Her earlier works here are a little timid, uncertain and messy. But by 1974, Beryl is Beryl, assured and confident. All the hallmarks are there: drinking, dancing, dressing up, laughing. Her characters are all big and plump, their bosoms are bursting, their eyes are cartoonish dots, their noses are sausage-y blobs. They all look the same, their uniformity – each figure distinguished only by hairdo or outfit – gives them a sort of universality, an immediate recognisability.View image in fullscreenSailors and Seagulls by Beryl Cook.Photograph: John Cook/Beryl CookIn 1975, an antique-dealing friend offered to take some paintings off her hands to free up some space, and before she knew it she’d hit the big time: she got a show at PlymouthArtCentre that same year, then an even bigger one at Whitechapel Gallery in London a year later. Soon her work was on magazine covers. She started doing children’s books and even got an OBE.The appeal is so obvious. Cook makes life look fun. The famous stuff here is all the bawdy, boozy, knee-slapping and titillation. Revellers fall about while doing karaoke, giggling women tumble out of a pub on a hen-do, girls in miniskirts play pool or piss themselves laughing as a male stripper rips off his jockstrap. This is a world of pints and laughter and dancing; of pubs and gay bars and cabarets; of public spaces where private desires can be lived out.Things get even saucier. There are two hilarious images of whip-wielding dominatrixes. Then a wall of self-portraits finds Cook indulging her and her husband’s fantasies. They dance naked with their reading glasses on. She smokes in lingerie, twirls pom-poms dressed as a cheerleader.View image in fullscreenEarnest and emotional … The Back Bar of the Lockyer Tavern by Beryl Cook.Photograph: Beryl Cook/John CookAnd she’s funny too, really funny. An old couple eat chips in a bus shelter covered in graffiti that says “Nigel is a wanker” and “I shagged a froggy”. In the background of her painting of Plymouth Argyle FC scoring a goal, you can just about see a rival fan strangling an Argyle supporter in among the celebrations. It’s great, hilarious, ridiculous.There’s the basic everyday stuff, too: bingo halls, Dyno-Rod workers clearing a drain, cheeky sailors having a smoke, women shopping at the market, nurses pulling a gurney, and everyone’s smiling and smirking in every painting.The rest of the show looks at her inspirations (Bruegel and Rubens, apparently) and her experiments with sculpture (including some very snazzy painted loo seats). But the real surprise is how earnest and emotional some of the work here is. Cook paints her son and husband felting a shed roof, her granddaughter on the swing, her daughter-in-law bringing up mugs of tea, everyone smiling gently. It’s so full of actual, genuine love. And it happens over and over in intimate paintings of her family. It’s lovely without being saccharine and gross.View image in fullscreenOrdinary is extraordinary … Window Dresser 2 by Beryl Cook.Photograph: Beryl Cook/John CookAcross town,a companion exhibition at Karst galleryfeatures work by contemporary artists with some thematic or aesthetic link to Cook: the brilliant, satirical cartoons of Olivia Sterling; the hyper-precise celebrations of LGBTQ lives of Flo Brooks; the hypnotic rave minimalism of Rhys Coren. It’s great, clever, fun and more than worth the trip.Cook’s body-positive depictions of everyday England allowed people to see their lives – whether sailors or strippers, gay or straight – reflected in art. While every serious artist in the country was trying to document the bleakness of working-class English life, Cook was out there saying: “Cheer up, mate, have a pint!”Her whole point isn’t just that the ordinary can be extraordinary. It’s that the ordinaryisextraordinary; that life is amazing, full of laughter and joy and fun. Being alive is precious and fantastical – and we should spend every possible second celebrating it.Beryl Cook: Pride and Joyis at the Box, Plymouth until 31 May.Explore more on these topicsArt and designPlymouthArtPaintingExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

This genre-defying drama about the black experience could now rule awards seasonFull list of nomineesSinners becomes first film in history to earn 16 Oscar nominationsThu 22 Jan 2026 12.45 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 15.19 ESTShareAgree with them or not, these Oscar nominations deliver a pert slap to the accepted assumptions of awards season. The industry had been expecting landslides for classy upmarket fare such asChloé Zhao’s Hamnet, Paul Thomas Anderson’sOne Battle After AnotherandGuillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein, and also for Josh Safdie’s delirious comedy Marty Supreme. And that’s what they got.But perhaps no one expected these titles to get quite as colossal a smackdown as they got from Ryan Coogler’svampire drama thriller Sinners: a violent, high-energy fantasia about racism, music and the black experience, which hassoared ahead with 16 nominations– the most for any film in 97 years of the Academy Awards. Whatever happens on the night itself, Ryan Coogler has made Oscar history.Despite the snubs to Paul Mescal (not nominated for playing Shakespeare), to the second half of the Wicked saga and to Chase Infiniti (ignored for her adored performance as Leonardo DiCaprio’s daughter in One Battle After Another), Sinners is now the big story of this Oscar season – perhaps its only story.During the annual backlash season, the contrarians have been unburdening themselves of their views that no, Hamlet wasn’t inspired by Shakespeare’s dead son Hamnet, and no, One Battle After Another doesn’t address the reality of Trumpism. Meanwhile, Sinners has been fighting andwinning a quite separate culture war, and bringing off a mighty achievement for a highly individual film, a freaky tale of supernatural evil that riffs shrewdly on the idea that the blues is a genre of music that is consumed by the enemies of its producers. In the words of a character played by Delroy Lindo, himself rightly nominated: “White folks like the blues just fine, just not the people who make it.” Sinners fans will be cheering on its subversion of placid awards-season verities.I admit that Sinners isn’t my favourite Coogler film – preferring his world-conquering afrofuturist superhero adventure Black Panther, his boxing drama Creed and his social realist essay Fruitvale Station. . But, yes, I should also concede that those were films in accepted genres and Sinners is arguably more structurally ambitious, in that it refuses these generic expectations and challenges what is admissible in what appears at first to be a realist drama. Sinners could yet rule this awards season and reward a formidable film-maker and his very stylish leading man:Michael B Jordan.View image in fullscreen‘A bacchanal of strangeness’ … Leonardo DiCaprio in One Battle After Another, which got 13 nominations.Photograph: APOtherwise, Anderson’s counterculture trip One Battle After Another comes in behind with 13 nominations, including best picture and director: a bacchanal of strangeness and a delirious 162-minute cadenza of pure, exuberant film-making technique – I predict that the directing nod is the one it may beat Coogler in. But who knows?Marty Supreme, Sentimental Value and Frankenstein are all behind with nine nominations: Marty, for me, is the movie touched with pure inspiration and Timothée Chalamet delivers the sugar rush of enjoyment. Sentimental Value is a good film, wonderfully acted by Renate Reinsve, though not as good as Joachim Trier’s previous film, The Worst Person in the World and perhaps straying a little too much into the (yes) sentimental movieland territory of George Clooney’s Jay Kelly. Frankenstein is a sumptuously crafted piece of tasteful filmic furniture, though for me lacking the electric spark of pure horror needed to bring it to life.Hamnet gets eight: that extravagant romantic fantasy adored by many, including me, and resented by others who feel they are being browbeaten by a mixture of emotional coercion and preening literary prestige. It’s a lovely film, andJessie Buckleyis still in pole position for best actress, though I feel that it may fade at the Oscars and clean up more at the Baftas.The best film of the year has four nominations: Kleber Mendonça Filho’s uproariously disturbing and yet somehow groovy Brazilian drama The Secret Agent – like Antonioni’s The Passenger rewritten by Elmore Leonard – with Wagner Moura getting a nomination for his performance as the scientist on the run from the authorities in 1970s Brazil. It’s a great film and it’s heartening to see it continue to find friends since its debut at Cannes.Explore more on these topicsOscars 2026SinnersMichael B JordanHamnetJessie BuckleyChloé ZhaoRyan CooglercommentShareReuse this content"

It seems like everyone is just waiting for America to cool down on this topic, hoping it will pass away. But what if it [does] not: what then?”Might is right: US ‘foreign policy’ held hostage to mad king Trump’s whimsRead moreSome European leaders have echoed those sentiments, with Poland’s Donald Tusk calling Greenland an “unneeded” distraction from Russia’s war in Ukraine and efforts to disrupt Europe.Ireland’s Micheál Martin said European leaders “cannot lose focus on the situation in Ukraine”, calling the situation “desperate”, but crediting the US with a “critical” role in achieving “a just and fair and sustainable peace in Ukraine”.Zelenskyy said: “Sending 14 or 40 soldiers to Greenland– what is that meant to achieve? What message does that send to Putin? To China? And perhaps, most importantly, what message does it send to Denmark?”During his speech, he suggested Ukraine could help defend Europe in the event of a Russian invasion of Greenland, saying: “We know what to do if Russian warships go near Greenland, Ukraine can help with that. They can sink near Greenland just as they do near Crimea.”Zelenskyy said Europe should play a more muscular role in targeting Russia’s “shadow fleet” of oil tankers, which help bankroll its war machine, and said it remained too easy for Russia to bypass sanctions and to continue mass-producing missiles and other ordnance.The threats to Europe were existential forNato, he said, and Europe needed a “united armed forces” that could defend the continent.“Today, Europe relies only on the belief that if danger comes, then Nato will react. But no one has really seen the alliance in action. If Putin decides to take Lithuania or strike Poland, who will respond? Right now, Nato exists thanks to the belief that the United States will act … but what if it doesn’t?”View image in fullscreenSteve Witkoff in Davos.Photograph: Gian Ehrenzeller/APZelenskyy delivered his speech shortly after he met Trump to discuss stalled talks for a peace deal to end Russia’s war in Ukraine.Trump told reporters that his meeting with Zelenskyy was “good” but that there was “a ways to go”. Witkoff, who met Putin later on Thursday, said the fact that the meeting was called by the Russians was a good sign.“I think we’ve got it down to one issue and we have discussed iterations of that issue, and that means it’s solvable,” Witkoff said before flying to Moscow. He was joined by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.Trump, when asked atDavoswhether he had a message for Putin, said: “The war has to end.”Putin greeted the Americans shortly before midnight in Moscow. Minutes after the talks began, Russia said it had carried out a patrol of strategic bomber planes – something it regularly does as a show of strength and deterrence.The defence ministry said the Tu-22M3 bombers – part of a long-range fleet that Russia has used throughout the war to fire missiles at Ukrainian cities, military targets and energy infrastructure – flew for more than five hours over the Baltic Sea, escorted by fighter jets.On Thursday Trumplaunched his international “board of peace”, established to manage a peace process in Gaza. Critics have said the ill-defined board appears to be a shadow United Nations.Ukraine, along with Russia and Belarus, has been invited to join the initiative but has so far demurred.“For us, it’s understandable that we will be on this board when the war will end,” Zelenskyy said. For now, “we are enemies [with the Russians]. Belarus is an ally of the Russians. We can’t be with them.”After Witkoff’s meetings at the Kremlin, Ukraine, Russia and the US will hold three-way talks in Abu Dhabi this weekend, marking the first time that the three countries have sat down together since Russia invaded in 2022. It was not clear whether the meetings would be held through shuttle diplomacy with the US acting as intermediary.“It will be the first trilateral meeting in the United Arab Emirates,” Zelenskyy said, without giving details on who would be attending from each country. “I hope [the] Emirates know about it. Sometimes we have such surprises from the American side.”On the trilateral meeting, Trump said late on Thursday: “Anytime we meet, it’s good.”While the US has said that a deal is within reach, Zelenskyy was less bullish, saying that Russia had to be “ready for compromises … not just Ukraine”.“We will see what the result will be,” he said. “It’s better than to not have any kind of dialogue.”Explore more on these topicsVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineDavos 2026EuropeGreenlandRussiaNatonewsShareReuse this content"

It is nominated for trophies including best picture, director, leading actor, supporting actor (for the British actor Delroy Lindo), supporting actress (for British-Nigerian actorWunmi Mosaku) and the Academy’s inaugural casting prize.The film’s nod for costume design also makes Ruth E Carter – now nominated five times overall – the most-nominated Black woman throughout the Oscars’ 97-year history. Meanwhile Sinners’ cinematography nomination for Autumn Durald Arkapaw marks only the fourth time a woman has ever been up for the award.Speaking toDeadline, Coogler said he was surprised to find multiple family members on his Los Angeles doorstep soon after 5am, in anticipation of the announcement. “My dad was keeping count next to me,” he said. “And when he said [it was 16], I was like, ‘Dad, you got it wrong. There’s no way it’s that many.’”Since news stories appeared verifying the number, said Coogler, his father “has been gleefully pointing out how right he was: ‘So you trust the articles, you don’t trust my counting?’”Oscar nominations 2026: the full listRead moreSinners’ multiple nods mean it smashes the record of 14 nominations shared by All About Eve (1950), Titanic (1997) and La La Land (2016). But while those films converted their nominations into a substantial number of wins (six, 11 and six, respectively), the expectation is that Coogler’s drama may end up with a smaller haul come 15 March.So far this season, ramshackle countercultural comedyOne Battle After Another has dominated in the awards, and at the Oscars it closely trails Sinners, with 13 nominations.Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson, a veteran Oscars bridesmaid with 11 prior nominations but no wins, is widely predicted to scoop both best picture and best director, with supporting actressTeyana Tayloralso tipped to win in her category. Three of the film’s other stars were also nominated – Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro – although Chase Infiniti was a surprise omission from the leading actress shortlist, while Song Sung Blue’s Kate Hudson did make the cut.View image in fullscreenKate Hudson in Song Sung Blue, a surprise inclusion in the leading actress category.Photograph: Focus Features/ShutterstockMeanwhile Chloé Zhao’s Hamnet also performed well, with eight nominations, including forJessie Buckley– the easy frontrunner in the best actress category – although Paul Mescal was a surprise snub in the supporting actor category.Speaking tothe Hollywood Reporterafter the announcement, Buckley said she was disappointed her co-star had not been nominated along with her. “I think he’s extraordinary in this film,” she said. “I know I’ve met a partner for life in doing this with him … There’s no part of what I created or what we created in this story which exists without Paul and what he poured into this story.”Zhao also edited, executive produced and co-wrote the Maggie O’Farrell adaptation, and is Anderson’s key rival in the adapted screenplay race (Coogler, her former film school classmate, is odds-on for original screenplay).In 2021,Zhao becamethe second woman (and first of colour) to win the best director Oscar in 2021 for Nomadland; this year she is the only female director on the shortlist, alongside Anderson, Coogler, Joachim Trier for Sentimental Value andJosh Safdie for Marty Supreme, which took a better-than-expected nine nominations.The star of that film, Timothée Chalamet, is favourite to take the best actor prize for his turn as a table tennis hustler in postwar New York. Chalamet narrowly missed out on the Oscar last year, when his portrayal of Bob Dylan was pipped by The Brutalist’s Adrien Brody. Should he prove victorious, Chalamet – who turned 30 last month – will become the second youngest best actor winner ever, behind Brody’s 2003 win for The Pianist.View image in fullscreenIncreasing internationalism … Stellan Skarsgård and Renate Reinsve in Sentimental Value which received nine nominations.Photograph: Kasper-Tuxen-AndersenBut there was less good news for Chalamet’s Marty Supreme co-star Gwyneth Paltrow, whose return to cinema after a 10-year Goop hiatus did not result in a nomination. Other stars who will be disappointed by Thursday’s announcement include Dwayne Johnson and Sydney Sweeney, both of whom went on transformative journeys for sports biopics The Smashing Machine and Christy, as well as George Clooney and Cynthia Erivo.Wicked: For Good underperformed across the board, scoring zero nods – including missing out on a widely anticipated supporting actress mention for Ariana Grande – while Noah Baumbach’s Jay Kelly, which stars Clooney as a movie star reassessing his life choices, also came away empty-handed.Instead, the spread of nominations this year reflected the Academy’s increasing internationalism, with subtitled films such as Sentimental Value, The Secret Agent and It Was Just An Accident named in multiple categories.Sentimental Value emerged especially strongly with a total of nine nominations, including four acting nods – for Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, Elle Fanning, Renate Reinsve and Stellan Skarsgård – as well as a best picture and best director mention for Trier.Meanwhile The Secret Agent star Wagner Moura has become the first Brazilian up for the best actor Oscar; the film is also nominated for casting, international feature film and best picture. The nods for Moura, Reinsve, Lilleaas and Skarsgård (Fanning speaks only English in the film) sets a new record for foreign-language acting nominees.Such success continues the trend that began in 2020 with Parasite’s multiple victories and was again witnessed last year with strong showings at the shortlist stage for I’m Still Here and Emilia Pérez (Sean Baker’s Anora ultimately went on to sweep the board).View image in fullscreenThe first Brazilian up for the best actor Oscar … Wagner Moura in The Secret Agent.Photograph: APMore than a quarter of the almost 11,000 voters now hail from outside the US, and the overall demographic breakdown is much more diverse than it was a decade ago. A 2014 survey conducted by theLos AngelesTimes found that the average age of Oscar voters was 63, 76% were men and 94% white. Ten years later, energetic measures to overhaul that profile – including almost doubling the numbers – mean that at least 35% of the voters identify as women and at least 25% are from ethnic minorities.Thursday’s nominations are already a victory for studio Warner Bros, currently the target of a takeover by Netflix, and whose slate last year included both Sinners andOne Battle After Another, as well as Superman and Weapons. The studio has 30 nominations this year, 12 more than its closest competitors Netflix and Neon, who both earned 18 nods.The second tranche of Oscar voting begins on 26 February, and involvesa newly introduced measureto ensure voters view all nominated films within a category before they can cast a vote in the final round.The ceremony takes place on 15 March and will again be hosted by Conan O’Brien. Three weeks before, the Baftas will be distributed in a ceremony overseen by incoming MC Alan Cumming; nominations for those awards are unveiled next Tuesday.One Battle After Another and Hamnet were the big winners at the Golden Globe awards earlier this week, but the division of those prizes into drama and musical or comedy categories traditionally makes them an unreliableOscarsbellwether.This article was amended on 22 January 2026 to name Joachim Trier as one of the the five nominees for best director, for his film Sentimental Value; not Guillermo del Toro, for Frankenstein, as stated in an earlier version.Explore more on these topicsOscars 2026OscarsAwards and prizesJessie BuckleyPaul MescalSinnersOne Battle After AnothernewsShareReuse this content"

He prompted outrage withinNo 10 and among cabinet ministerswhen he said in the run up to the party’s conference last year that many MPs hadurged him to run for Labour leader.He has long been believed to be seeking a return to parliament tostand for the Labour leadershipif there was a challenge to Starmer, but was thought to have limited options for a byelection in the north-west of England.The government will have to move the writ for a byelection, which two well-placed sources suggested was likely to take place before the May elections, meaning Burnham could be in place for any aftermath.But his allies have cautioned not to overstate the extent of planning that might be under way, suggesting that he was passionate about his current job and would only return to national politics if he had something to contribute.“People want to paint him as scheming and plotting but that’s absolutely not where he is. He loves being mayor ofManchester. It would only ever be an option if felt he had something to offer,” one said.But with polls suggesting Starmer is unpopular in the country and many MPs despondent about Labour’s fate at the next election, Burnham stands out as the only seniorLabourfigure with positive public approval ratings.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Andy Burnham after Labour’s win in 2024.Photograph: Ian Vogler/Daily Mirror/PAShould Burnham decide to run, there are still multiple obstacles standing in his way. He would need to be selected by the NEC – where the odds are stacked against him – and win the byelection in Gorton and Denton against Reform UK and pro-Gaza independents, all before any potential leadership challenge.Senior Labour figures told the Guardian that a “Stop Andy” campaign was already under way, with the party machinery tightly controlled by Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s chief of staff, and his allies.The prime minister himself said on Thursday that the byelection process was in the “early stages” and his MPs must stop talking about potential leadership challenges.“My message is to my entire party, and is that every minute we waste talking about anything other than the cost of living and stability in Europe and across the globe is a wasted minute,” he told Channel 4 News.Burnham, speaking before Gwynne confirmed he was stepping down, told reporters: “People shouldn’t rush to conclusions. I have been very focused on my role as mayor of Greater Manchester and I think the [reindustrialisation] plan I put out this week shows that.”Five members of the NEC told the Guardian they believed it would be impossible for Burnham to make it through the selection panel given the number of Starmer allies in the committee and how they could be handpicked to sit on the selection panel.They said this was not just down to personal animosity to Burnham, but also the cost of a mayoral byelection in Greater Manchester, which would mean that about £500,000 of party funding was diverted from other races across Britain.“It is deeply selfish of Andy to want to run for this – costing us tens of thousands we don’t have and diverting activist resources when we are fighting other crucial elections. It is absurd beyond description and cannot be allowed,” one said.Several sources shared concerns about Nigel Farage’s party attempting to fill any vacancy created by Burnham. “What if Reform won the Greater Manchester mayoralty? It would be totemic for them: their biggest win yet. We would be mad to let that happen,” one said.Burnham, as a publicly elected mayor, would have to secure the NEC’s permission to run. It is also possible the body could impose an all-female shortlist in order to stop his nomination.However, one Burnham ally warned against assuming the NEC would automatically block his candidacy, even though Starmer’s team is widely thought to control it.“I don’t think anybody wants a big fight within the NEC. That’s not where anybody wants to end up. Nobody benefits from that. But you would be unwise to second guess the NEC,” they said.The unions are a significant force on the party’s ruling body, holding 13 out of about 40 seats. The biggest unions – Unite, Unison and the GMB – were for now keeping their counsel, although sources suggested they would be uncomfortable with anything that looked like interference from No 10.Labour’s Andrew Gwynne resigns paving the way for return of Andy Burnham as an MP– as it happenedRead moreBut even with their support, two insiders suggested Burnham could still struggle to get the numbers to overrule a selection panel and get on the shortlist for the seat, clearing the NEC.The Fire Brigades Union general secretary, Steve Wright, said: “It would be a democratic outrage ifAndy Burnhamwas blocked from seeking selection as Labour’s byelection candidate in this seat.“In the event that a byelection takes place, as an affiliated union, the FBU will not stand by and allow seniorLabourpoliticians like Andy to be carved out of this process. Our union will fiercely resist any attempts to stitch up the selection.“It’s vital that there is a full and open democratic procedure to choose Labour’s candidate to fight this byelection. Anything less would be unacceptable.”Another said that MPs and members were already concerned about the risk of destabilising the party with leadership speculation before the local and devolved elections in May. “I don’t think anybody would thank Andy for triggering more of that,” one said.Gwynne has a 13,413 majority in the seat, which lies to the south-east of Manchester. Reform UK is likely to mount a significant challenge in any byelection, capitalising on support in the Tameside part of the constituency.Labour believes it is on firmer ground in the larger, Greater Manchester part of the seat, although could face some pressure from pro-Gaza independents.Should Burnham return to parliament, he would have to secure the backing of 80 Labour MPs to challenge Starmer, although the mayor – who served in Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s governments – is viewed with scepticism by some on the backbenches.Gwynne was said by some MPs to have reached an agreement with Burnham to allow the Greater Manchester mayor to stand in his seat after he quit, but the two are not close and both have denied any pact.There had been speculation for months that Gwynne was trying to strike a deal with the MPs pension authority that would allow him to retire early on grounds of ill health.Friends of the MP said that would mean he would receive a yearly payout until he reached retirement age, when he would be entitled to the full pension.On Thursday, Gwynne confirmed that his mental health had deteriorated to such an extent that he was stepping down, triggering a byelection in his constituency.Andy Burnham’s road back to parliament would be a bumpy oneRead moreThe former minister said in a statement that while proud of his achievements in parliament, he had “suffered significant ill-health over most of the 21 years I’ve served as an MP”.He quoted a note from his GP, who said that he was “extremely vulnerable and further stress will cause rapid deterioration”, and that he did not think he could safely return to parliament.Gwynne added: “I wish theLabourgovernment every success in meeting our country’s challenges head-on and providing the real change the people of Britain voted for in 2024”.Gwynne is still subject to a parliamentary standards investigation, which wasinitiated last yearafter he was found to have been in a WhatsApp group – called Trigger Me Timbers – that shared vulgar and inflammatory comments about voters and other MPs. He was suspended from the party after the messages came to light.Explore more on these topicsAndy BurnhamLabourKeir StarmerManchesterGreater ManchesterByelectionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier this month, he claimed it had “incorrectly and inappropriately” discriminated against him.Trump says he’ll sue JPMorgan Chase for allegedly cutting him off after US Capitol riotRead moreThe lawsuit was filed in Miami by Alejandro Brito, Trump’s Miami-based personal lawyer, who also has been involved in Trump’s legal action against media companies such as ABC News and the BBC for defamation.“While we regret President Trump has sued us, we believe the suit has no merit,” JP Morgan said in a statement. “We respect the president’s right to sue us and our right to defend ourselves – that’s what courts are for.”The bank “does not close accounts for political or religious reasons”, a spokesperson added. “We do close accounts because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company. We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so.”Shares in JP Morgan slipped slightly after the filing was first reported. They closed up 0.4% late in New York.In the lawsuit, Trump’s lawyers alleged that the bank had put Trump, the Trump Organization and its affiliated entities, along with members of Trump’s family, on a blacklist.JP Morgan “did not provide plaintiffs with any recourse, remedy or alternative – its decision was final and unequivocal”, the lawsuit claims, claiming that Trump and the other plaintiffs are “confident that JPMC’s unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations, and JPMC’s unsubstantiated, ‘woke’ beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political reviews”.Later on Thursday, Trump told reporters he had not spoken directly to Dimon.Last weekend, the presidentannouncedon social media he would file a lawsuit against the bank, accusing it of removing his accounts after the January 6 insurrection. Trump has said several banks, including JP Morgan and Bank of America, rejected his deposits after the riot, though both banks have denied the allegations.The post seemed to be inspired by a Wall Street Journalreportthat Trump had offered Dimon the role of Federal Reserve chair last year. Trump denied the accusation and said he would be suing the bank.In response to Saturday’s social media post, JP Morgan said in a statement: “We agree that no one’s account should ever be closed because of political or religious beliefs.”“We appreciate that this administration has moved to address political debanking and we support those efforts,” the statement said.Dimon, whotook home a $43m compensation packagelast year, spoke in defense of Fed chairJerome Powellearlier this month, after it emerged that Trump’s justice department hadinitiated a criminal investigationagainst him.After Powell disclosed justice department subpoenas against the Fed over the weekend, Dimon spoke out in his defense. Dimon said he has “enormous respect for Jay Powell, the man” despite disagreement over some of the Fed’s policy choices.“Anything that chips away at [the Fed’s independence] is not a good idea,” Dimon said, warning that itrisked driving up inflationand interest rates.In a swift response,Trump said Dimon was wrongand that “it’s fine what I’m doing.” “We should have lower rates,” Trump said last week. “Jamie Dimon probably wants higher rates – maybe he makes more money that way.”At the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, Dimon was particularly critical of Trump’s proposal to cap credit-card interest rates at 10% for the first year,callingthe idea a potential “economic disaster”.He alsosuggestedthe US had become less reliable under Trump. “If you said to me, ‘Has America become unreliable?’ No,” Dimon said at an event. “It’s just, you had total reliance, and now it’s less reliable.”Trump is one of several prominent rightwing figures to complain of having been “debanked” by leading financial institutions due to their political positions.In the UK, NatWest Group’s chief executive, Dame Alison Rose,stood down in 2023after she admitted being the source of an inaccurate BBC story about the reasons Reform UK leader Nigel Farage had been “debanked”.Farage threatened legal action against the bank, andlater settled.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJamie DimonUS Capitol attackUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Ellison was previously head of FTX’s associated trading arm and the on-again, off-again romantic partner of the crypto exchange’s founder,Sam Bankman-Fried.Ellison, 31, wassentenced to 24 months in prisonin 2024 after pleading guilty to seven charges, including wire fraud and money laundering. She featured prominently as a witness for the prosecution of Bankman-Fried, testifying that her former paramour directed her to commit crimes. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison.Ellison’s release is an epilogue to one of the largest financial-fraud investigations in US history. The collapse ofFTX, once among the world’s biggest crypto firms, attracted immense media attention, rattled markets and for a time led to increased regulatory scrutiny of the crypto industry.Along with Bankman-Fried, Ellison was the most prominent character in FTX’s $8bn fraud. Her digital footprint, which included Tumblr posts on race science and polyamory, provided substantial fuel for social media mockery and tabloid headlines. When Ellison and other FTX executives turned against Bankman-Fried during his trial, they provided one of the most dramatic moments of the proceedings. Netflix announced last year it would adapt the FTX story with Julia Garner starring as Ellison.At her 2024 sentencing, Judge Lewis Kaplan said that he had never seen someone cooperate with prosecutors like Ellison in his 30 years on the bench. Kaplan nevertheless told the court that, given the severity of the crimes, he had decided to sentence Ellison to jail time. He ordered her to forfeit $11bn in assets.Ellison began serving her two-year sentence in a Connecticut prison, but was transferred last October to community confinement,the Bureau of Prisons told Business Insider. She left the facility on Wednesday.Bankman-Fried continues to serve his sentence in a Los Angeles low-security federal prison. He launched a push last year for a pardon from Donald Trump, which included giving an interview from jail to the rightwing media influencer Tucker Carlson.ButTrump stated this monthto the New York Times that he had no plans to pardon Bankman-Fried.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesFTXSam Bankman-FriednewsShareReuse this content"

Armstrong wasone of three people arrestedon Thursday in connection to a demonstration that disrupted church services in St Paul, Minnesota, on Sunday. Demonstrators alleged that one of the pastors, David Easterwood, was the acting field director of the St Paul Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office. Bondi announced the arrests on social media on Thursday morning.The homeland security secretary,Kristi Noem, posted an image of Armstrong’s arrest at 10.21am on Thursday, less than an hour after Bondi’s announcement. The image shows a law enforcement agent, face blurred out, escorting Armstrong, who appears to be handcuffed. Armstrong, dressed in all black, appears to be composed in the picture.A little more than 30 minutes later, the White House posted another image of Armstrong’s arrest in which she is crying. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, reposted the image. The image posted by the White House is altered, a Guardian analysis found.two images of a woman, one neutral and one cryingThe Guardian overlaid the White House photo with the Noem photo and found that the law enforcement agents in both pictures line up exactly, confirming they are the same image. There are other similarities between the photos. An unidentified person can be seen in the same place behind the arresting agent. And the arresting agent’s arm appears to be behind Armstrong’s back in exactly the same position.Asked whether the image had been digitally altered, the White House responded by sending a post on X from Kaelan Dorr, the deputy communications director.“YET AGAIN to the people who feel the need to reflexively defend perpetrators of heinous crimes in our country I share with you this message: Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue. Thank you for your attention to this matter,”he said.The White House X account, which has around 3.5 million followers, has made at least 14 posts with AI since the start of Trump’s second term,Poynter reported in October.Julius Constantine Motal and David McCoy contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationAI (artificial intelligence)ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Pam BondiUS politicsUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

But we have seen for ourselves there’s nothing to actually fear.”They originally set out to raise £35,000 to open a school at a Sudanese refugee camp in Chad, but the pair have raised almost £90,000 and now hope to build several schools.They set out from Kent on 19 December, deliberately choosing to complete the walk over the coldest weeks of the year to make it a tougher challenge. One of the most gruelling moments of the trek was crossing the border to Scotland, a 16-hour walk from Otterburn to Galashiels in -5C (23F) temperatures.Malual said: “It’s deeply personal to me. Deciding to do this in winter was to create awareness and also to put myself in the shoes of day-to-day Sudanese struggles in life, how hard it is for them to survive and walk hundreds of miles to find safety.”The pair were supported by Asylum Speakers, an organisation that helps amplify refugee voices in the UK. Gulwali Passarlay, an Afghan refugee and public speaker who helped provide logistical support for the walk, said: “The rightwing politicians keep saying they know the will of the people. But the will of the people we’ve seen has been very different.“In the last 900 miles, they’ve seen nothing but compassion, kindness and generosity. They raised £90,000. In just a month. They have seen more of Britain than some of these racist politicians who claim to represent the people. They’ve been through so many cities and towns and villages, and met so many people.”After reaching their final destination ofDuncansby Head lighthouseon Wednesday, the pair arrived back into London on Thursday evening where they were met by a welcome party at King’s Cross station to congratulate them on their endeavour.Reflecting on what the walk had taught him, Malual said: “When we were on that journey, walking in the cold and on the road, finding these people we didn’t know helping us out and supporting us, without judging us based on what we look like – that is the true value of this society.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsCharitiesSouth SudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It envisages a unified Palestinian-run Gaza, which represents a rebuff to the aims of Israeli extremists, including some in the governing coalition, who have soughtthe deportation of Gaza’s population and the building of Israeli settlementsin its place.The plan’s success will depend largely on whether Trump and his board of peace has the determination to implement the plan, overcoming Israeli objections and obstruction – and whether a mechanism can be created inside Gaza to oversee the disarming of Hamas.Trump claims world ‘richer, safer’ than year ago at launch of his ‘board of peace’Read moreA slideshow presented in Davos by Trump’s son-in-lawJared Kushnerimagined a futuristic dreamscape of gleaming apartment blocks and office towers, with neat industrial parks and residential districts – and even an airport. The territory had a slice taken off it to create a buffer zone along the Israeli border, and was treated as blank slate, ignoring the property rights of generations of Palestinians, but it was a move away from a partition between Hamas and Israeli-run halves.The plan also spelled out more achievable promises for the next 100 days, including the restoration of basic infrastructure – including water, sewage and electric systems, hospitals and bakeries – together with a significant increase in the flow of goods enteringGaza. The critical Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt is due to open for traffic next week, for the first time since Israeli troops seized control of it in May 2024.Kushner committed the US administration to achieving those short-term goals.“The next 100 days we’re going to continue to just be heads down and focused on making sure this is implemented,” he said. “We continue to be focused on humanitarian aid, humanitarian shelter, but then creating the conditions to move forward.”View image in fullscreenJared Kushner presenting the Gaza plan at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APThe board of peace will be represented in Gaza by a “high representative”, a veteran Bulgarian and UN diplomat, Nickolay Mladenov. But the plan, as spelled out in Davos, puts much of the onus for implementation on the newly formed National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), a panel of Palestinian non-partisan technocrats who are supposed to run Gaza for a transition period.Its chair, the “chief commissioner” Ali Shaath, addressed the assembled world leaders in Davos by video link from Cairo, but also spoke directly to the people of Gaza, largely ignored so far in the Trump peace plan.“Step by step, with discipline and determination, we will rebuild a capable Gaza, capable of self-reliance, and we will build it into a centre for freedom, opportunity and peace,” Shaath told his fellow Palestinians.Shaath, an engineer and a former deputy transport minister in the Palestinian Authority, said the NCAG’s mission was “to restore order, to rebuild institutions and to recreate a future for the people of Gaza defined by opportunity and dignity under the principle of one authority, one law and one weapon”.According to documents supplied by the administration, “one weapon” means that all weapon possession in the future Gaza can be “authorised by one authority only (NCAG)”.The clause addressed a major and immediate hurdle to turning a semi-observed ceasefire into a real and lasting truce. US and Israeli officials agree there will not be further withdrawals by the Israeli army (still occupying more than half of Gaza) until Hamas disarms.Hamas has reportedly agreed in principle to hand over its heavy weapons, such as rockets and artillery, to a Palestinian administration, and is said to be prepared to accept the NCAG.To put that to the test, Shaath and the NCAG would have to be allowed to enter Gaza with a Palestinian police force that has been trained in Jordan and Egypt over past months.The plan presented in Davos notably made no mention of the international stabilisation force (ISF), which was a key part of Trump’s peace proposals last year, endorsed in November by aUN security council resolution.Creating the ISF has been fraught with problems. None of the countries in the Arab and Islamic world that provisionally agreed to provide troops wanted their soldiers to confront Hamas over its weaponry. Israel declared it wouldnot accept Turkish or Qatari forces, while other potential troop contributors insisted that Turkey and Qatar were involved.The US blueprint mentions only the new Palestinian police force. Heavy weapons would be “decommissioned immediately”, it said.“Personal arms [will be] registered and decommissioned by sector as NCAG police becomes capable of guaranteeing personal security,” the blueprint said. The end state would be a situation in which “only NCAG-sanctioned personnel may carry weapons”.The immediate test of the blueprint will come next week, when the Rafah crossing is due to open. “Opening Rafah signals Gaza is no longer closed to the future or to the world. This is a real step and it marks a new direction,” Shaath said in his video presentation.However, Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet is due to discuss the opening of Rafah next week. There is considerable opposition inside the coalition to reopening the crossing, at least until the remains of the last unaccounted-for Israeli hostage, Ran Gvili, are returned.There will be considerably more internal opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian interim government in territory, which the far right is bent on emptying and annexing. The plan does not say a future Gaza would be part of a sovereign Palestinian state. But it does not exclude a unifiedPalestine, and it is unlikely the NCAG would be able to recruit credible Palestinian members if it did.Under the plan, the Israeli army would withdraw progressively from all Gaza territory in phases from the current truce line agreed as part of phase 1 of the plan. That further withdrawal would be “based on agreed-upon standards”, the Kushner blueprint said, but it gave no details, raising questions over whether Israel would comply.For the population of Gaza, most still living in tents andunder regular Israeli fire, perhaps the most encouraging aspect of Thursday’s presentation in Davos was that Trump clearly still sees his prestige and that of his “board of peace” as being wrapped up in the ceasefire he brokered last year.In other words, the ceasefire plan is still harnessed to the bulldozer of the president’s self-esteem, which at least has the potential to break through the substantial hurdles to a free and peaceful Gaza.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineDonald TrumpJared KushnerIsraelUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

How The Traitors lost its soulIt used to be a breath of fresh air – TV’s most relatable reality show. Now it features shouting matches and bad-tempered confrontations, and the biggest loser is the viewerAlexi DugginsThu 22 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 11.00 ESTShareFor the past year,The Traitorshas had a massive problem. No, not the parade of indistinguishable white male contestants. Nor the way it increasingly kills off its most likable characters too early (RIP Jessie). Not even the fact that the disproportionate number of people of colour who leave the show early suggests it has a big problem with unconscious bias. Actually, sorry: let me rephrase. The Traitors has two massive problems.But here’s the one that defines this series: what the point of the show actually is. The celebrity version blew the previous regular season of The Traitors out of the water. It was absolutely charming, featuring a bunch of lovely people playing a gripping game while committing the politest series of murders possible. It smashed the normal version in every sense: ratings, watchability, how instantly it hooked you. And it was always going to be that way, given that this is a show that functions best when you’re rooting for as many contestants as possible. So when nearly every player is one you’re already familiar with, it inevitably makes for more gripping TV than a series where you spend the first two weeks going: “Sorry, there’s a guy in there called Jack?”But the runaway success of The Celebrity Traitors has risked the standard version looking as if its USP is: “The dull one.” The show’s producers have decided to deal with that problem by amping up the drama. Before its launch,Claudia Winklemancalled its new direction “hardcore” and “brutal”, adding that: “We get some very juicy round tables … It gets very heated ... it gets ugly.” She’s certainly not wrong. Some of this year’s contestants seem incapable of having their name mentioned at the round table without blowing their stack. James is often tetchy. Jade is on a constant hair trigger. By the end of Friday’s show, there was such bad blood that she even refused Matty’s offer of a hug, and he had to come back to try again the following episode.View image in fullscreenHead to head … Harriet takes on Rachel.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryThere has also been open warfare in the castle for the first time, with Fiona explosively going head-to-head with Rachel in a way that seemed genuinely ill-tempered. Even Harriet’s strategic attempt to take Rachel out devolved into such an unpleasantly aggressive breakfast shouting match that she has since told the Times: “It was awful watching it, I lost my temper and it’s not nice to see that … It was so intense, the pressure just got to me. That was insane behaviour. I’d never normally shout at someone I only met two weeks ago over breakfast.”It is, frankly, a massive shame. When it was first broadcast, The Traitors was a breath of fresh air. It felt like a revolution in reality TV, not because it had a penchant for the dramatic, but because it was populated by hugely relatable people navigating reality TV dynamics in an extremely nice way. So endearingly understated were the first couple of seasons, that sometimes people got kicked out of the game because they admitted to playing the game. It was the most British reality show imaginable.View image in fullscreen‘On a constant hair trigger’ … Jade in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryIn its first season, The Traitors was hailed as channelling the joy of the first season of Big Brother – where a bunch of ordinary people captivated the nation by being low-key daffy. Whose most iconic moment involved the entire cast (and viewing public) uniting in their apocalyptic hatred of calculated gameplay – and vilifying a man called Nick for writing some names on a bit of paper. It was a comparison that felt very apt – like BB, the early outings of The Traitors charmed a broad audience, many of whom wouldn’t normally go near the histrionics and confrontation of a typical reality show.In 2026, however, ruthless rules The Traitors. Winning the show has increasingly morphed into an exercise in who can be the most cut-throat. And that person, without question, is Rachel. She effortlessly batted away both Fiona and Harriet’s ferocious attacks. The way she blindsided Ross with: “Was Hugo this dramatic in the turret?” at the round table was one of the most astonishingly brazen bits of gameplay the show has ever produced. She will seemingly stop at nothing to win – and it’s working. Barring, of course, any last-minute dramatics from Faraazatha Christie.View image in fullscreen‘Read a copy of American Psycho as a training manual’ … Paul Gorton in The Traitors series two.Photograph: Studio Lambert/BBCThere have been cut-throat players before, of course – season two’s Paul Gorton even read a copy of American Psycho as a training manual. He didn’t, however, manage to match his arrogance levels to his ability to not get booted out,and proved an unwitting comic delight. Series one’s Wilf certainly had no compunction in stabbing his fellow traitors in the back. But his tendency to break down in tears when sticking the knife in – not to mentionbeing gloriously undone by Kieran’s parting shot– kept him the right side of likable. And while there’s been one other proper watch-through-fingers moment of brutality –Harry’s betrayal of Mollie in season two’s finale– that, at least, came in the show’s dying seconds.To watch The Traitors now, though, is no longer to immerse yourself in the friendliness that characterised previous seasons. Instead, it’s to plunge yourself into an energy that feels much more predictably reality TV, with its histrionics and manufactured drama. Where, for the first time, truly unpleasant moments have flared up. It is, of course, still very watchable television, but given the state of the world right now, do we really want to see the UK’s most lovely bit of reality escapism morph into something much harder and more aggressive? No thanks. In attempting to become a more brutal version of itself, it’s hard not to suspect that The Traitors has lost something: a bit of its soul.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe TraitorsReality TVClaudia WinklemanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Had he been injured whilesparring in the boxing ring? Had he injured himself while working out in the gym? Did he simply, some wondered, want to avoid looking Donald Trump in the eye?Few could have blamed Macron for channelling Tom Cruise in a mission impossible to neutralise the US president’s plan to take over Greenland andimpose 200% trade tariffs on French wine and champagne. Some, like the communication specialist Philippe Moreau Chevrolet, saw the president’s decision to wear the French-made eyewear as symbolic in the context of France’s strained relations with the US.The real reason was more prosaic: Macron was stylishly disguising a subconjunctival haemorrhage, a burst blood vessel in his right eye – a condition he described as “totally benign”.But even he was not immune to cliches. Addressing French troops at a military event last week, Macron had described the problem as “l’oeil du tigre” (the eye of the tiger). The comment referenced the 1982 song by the rock band Survivor used in the boxing film Rocky III starring Sylvester Stallone. For those too young to get the reference, it was a “mark of determination”, he added.View image in fullscreenThe sunglasses prompted rumours that the French president may have been injured in the boxing ring.Photograph: Soazig de la Moissonnière/Présidence de la RépubliqueFor the artisan workers atMaison Henry Jullienin the département of Jura in eastern France, where glasses have been made for more than 100 years, it was publicity impossible to buy.Stefano Fulchir, the president of iVision Tech, the Italian company that owns Henry Jullien, said the first he knew of the presidential endorsement was when French opticians rang him to say: “The president’s wearing our glasses!” When news spread, the company website crashed for most of the day.“My first reaction can be summed up in three letters: wow! It has not been a typical day. I feel very honoured that the president is wearing our glasses,” he said.Macron’s office had contacted the company in 2024 to buy a pair of €659 Pacific S 01 Double Gold sunglasses as a diplomatic gift during the G20 summit and a second pair for himself, he said.“I said I would be happy to send him a pair but they said no. He did not accept them as a gift, but wanted to purchase them personally. The French president paid a lot of attention to whether the glasses were entirely made inFrance.”View image in fullscreenHenry Jullien’s Pacific sunglasses, which were worn by Macron in Switzerland.Photograph: Henry JullieniVision acquired Henry Jullien, founded in 1921, in 2023. Fulchir said the team of 10 staff at the factory at Lons-le-Saunier, north of Geneva, produced about 1,000 of the sunglasses worn by Macron a year.The glasses are hand assembled and made using what iVision calls an “ancient technique”, where gold is bonded rather than plated to the base metal, making it harder wearing. The blue-tinted UV lenses are produced byDalloz,another Jura-based company.Fulchir said the glasses were available at opticians around the world and even in war-ravaged Ukraine, but the company had yet to find a UK distributor.“This is not ordinary eyewear; it’s a luxury product that won’t break after two years and that can be used for a long time. It’s an investment, like jewellery, like a watch,” he said.Jimmy Mohamed, a medical doctor and media commentator, told the French broadcaster RTL that he believed Macron had worn the sunglasses for “aesthetic reasons”. “The glasses protect his image, but not really his eye,” Mohamed said.Explore more on these topicsEmmanuel MacronFranceDavosDavos 2026newsShareReuse this content"

When work has got too much, even friendships feel like a drain and you feel like you simply can’t keep going with your life as it currently is?For Emma Gannon, the answer was extreme but non-negotiable: an entire year of nothing – or close to it. Gannon, the London-based author of fiction, nonfiction andthe Hyphennewsletter, burned out with a bang in late 2022. While on a spa weekend with a friend, she had a panic attack, her first ever.Gannon notes the irony of having “a mental breakdown at a luxury hotel”, but her fight-or-flight, apocalyptic feeling seemed to warrant extreme measures. After being diagnosed with anxiety and burnout, she pared her life and commitments back to the bare minimum and spent the next 12 months recuperating.With hindsight, Gannon says, her burnout was triggered by a pattern of people-pleasing, leading her off-track. In her new book,A Year of Nothing, Gannon reflects on the lessons of that transformative “fallow year”, forcing her to learn how to rest, build resilience and reconnect with what matters.Here, she shares her tips for coming back to life after burnout.How to end the year right: come up with your own personal ritualsRead moreWhen your body says stop, listenWhen Gannon’s burnout hit, she was enjoying success in her career, had strong relationships and had no sense of her reserves running low. “It really caught me by surprise,” she says.But looking back, there were signs that she’d hit her limits, she says. On holiday that summer, she found herself glued to her phone, doomscrolling and unable to relax or enjoy herself.Back at home, she felt reluctant to see her best friends, even on New Year’s Eve, and was made disproportionately angry by the fireworks. Her eyes ached, her body felt like a “big, heavy lump” and her hairline showed signs of thinning.After that first panic attack at the spa, Gannon began experiencing attacks regularly, along with “completely out-of-body” feelings of dissociation, forcing her to confront her exhaustion.“We all have a performative identity that we put on every morning – that side of me had been running the show,” she says. “This very small voice inside me was saying: ‘This is not the life you want, and we’re going to shut this down.’”Pare back to the necessitiesAfter being diagnosed, Gannon cancelled all but her essential commitments, even quitting the successful podcast she’d hosted for six years and pulling out of a childhood friend’s wedding.Being able to step back was a privilege, reflecting her financial cushion and control over her career, she says – but the experience also reshaped her attitude toward money and what she considered necessary spending. One day, Gannon remembers, all she did was walk to the supermarket, buy a bunch of daffodils for £1 and walk home. “When you’re going through this, make everything very small,” she says. “There will be a time when you can be big again.”Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’If you can’t afford to take time off, reducing expenses and building a savings buffer can expand your options, she says – for example, in the event that you should need to go part-time or search for another job.“What can you do in life to lower your overheads? Even now, I don’t want to spend money on clothes, because I’d rather save so I can do nothing a bit longer.”Quit drinking – if only for a bitGannon stopped drinking alcohol after noticing how she used it to numb herself. She found drinking cast a “chemical blanket” over her unhappiness and the parts of her life that weren’t working, as well as the particular pleasures of socialising and special occasions.“There’s nothing wrong with a glass of wine, but if you feel like you’re blocking things out, I think not drinking for a bit is a good place to start,” she says. As well as avoiding alcohol’s depressive effect, “it comes down to learning to take care of yourself”, Gannon says.Nourishment was a cornerstone of her recovery, she goes on: “Would you invite your friend round and just give them a packet of Pringles for dinner? Probably not, because you love them ... You’d make them a really nice soup, and buy the best bread – so do that for yourself.”Make a playlist of sad songsHaving been in survival mode for so long, Gannon found it took some time to connect with her emotions. What helped crack her open was music. Listening to Max Richter on one of her many long aimless walks allowed her to “feel all my feelings, for the first time in ages”, Gannon says.She had previously struggled to play the song all the way through – a sign of how shut down she had become, she suggests.Now Gannon recommends making a playlist of melancholy, reflective or meaningful songs likely to help coax out those suppressed emotions: “You’re creating space to be nostalgic, and get back in touch with the side of you that you’ve essentially lost track of.”If you find it difficult to cry, a playlist “puts brackets around it”, she adds: “I think there’s a courage to it: ‘I’m not going to block anything out for a while.’”‘Let them’, creatine and fibermaxxing: the biggest wellness trends of 2025Read moreJust ‘be’ with a friendOne of the unexpected upsides of Gannon’s burnout was the clarity it gave her on her friendships, she says. Without the social lubricant of alcohol, some connections faded away.The people Gannon treasured most during that time were those she felt comfortable doing nothing with. “I only hung out with people that could just accept where I was at,” she says – sweatpants, unwashed hair and all.Once, one of her best friends came over and watched both Sister Act films in near-silence, before going home. “And it was amazing,” Gannon recalls.What mattered was the non-judgmental presence and ambient support, she says: “It’s the opposite of trying to fix someone … I came out of the burnout being really certain who my friends were.”Reconnect with past passions – and selvesDuring her “year of nothing”, Gannon spent time at her family home and revisited her teenage haunts. It helped her to reconnect with her youthful hopes, dreams and hobbies that had fallen by the wayside.Now Gannon tries to accommodate her younger self by keeping her favourite books from her childhood on her office shelves and displaying personal trinkets by her bed. “I like to open my eyes and be reminded of what I want to do with my life,” she says.Recently, Gannon went by herself to see Incubus, a somewhat “rogue” band she’d loved as a teenager, and was struck by the emotion coursing through the crowd. “You remember that that 15-year-old is still there, and you can connect with her whenever you want, even though your tastes and life changes,” she says.Find a new viewEven when “being in nature” felt too broad or big of an ask, Gannon found that she benefited from a change of scenery. “Is there water near you, or a park? Is there a hill that you can climb, and stand on the top of for a bit?” she says.“Getting some height” and the change of perspective in particular was refreshing, she says, tallying withfindings on the impact of aweon mental and emotional wellbeing: “It does something to the brain and makes you think things are possible, if you feel hemmed in.”Even the most dense cities have pockets of green that can provide respite, Gannon adds: “It’s almost like you forget.”The magic touch: how healthy are massages actually?Read moreExplore movement and touchGannon freely admits to “being quite woo-woo”; she explored many alternative therapies during her recovery, including reflexology. Your mileage may vary, but yoga, other gentle exercise and even massage can help to give your mind a break, release your emotions and return you to your body.Though Gannon “just cannot” get on with yoga, she says, she’s had many emotional moments during massages, unexpectedly breaking down in tears or having a sudden moment of clarity. That could be down to the kindness and care of the practitioner, the power of human touch, the placebo effect or simply the opportunity to pause.Now that her burnout is behind her, Gannon says, she’s more resilient, better attuned to signs that her energy is depleting and faster to respond.Keep on checking inWhen life doesn’t allow for protection against burnout for good, becoming aware of those individual physical and psychological tells is half the battle, she says: “Every week or so, I do a little check-in: ‘How are you feeling? What’s going on?’ – kind of talking to myself like a friend – because you can lose track.”A Year of Nothing byEmma Gannonisavailable from22JanuaryExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyWhy am I like this?HealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The1-0 defeat against the “Asean All Stars”, a scratch, invitational side that had never previously played together, didn’t help but the tour was plagued by their fatigued, uninterested players looking utterly fed up, some of them sulking, yawning and even sticking their middle fingers up at fans who had come out to watch them play. Around £8m-£10m was estimated to have been generated, but at what cost?Football Daily is delighted to report that United could well be at it again. But rather than a post-season tour to alter people’s perceptions, the club have reportedly agreed a deal with Lionsgate to create a dramatised retelling of the club’s history, which theAthletic claimsis similar in style to The Crown, a show that famously did wonders for people’s perceptions of the royal family. The British TV writer and director (and United fan) Jed Mercurio has apparently been approached for his doubtlessly impartial take, while “United will receive a guaranteed sum in the low multi-million pounds”, which should at least make the summer contract renewal negotiations a little easier.View image in fullscreenClaire Foy and John Lithgow could get another gig?Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyFor all the chiding and the snarking around of this potential TV series, there are plenty of moments to revisit, some clearly darker than others. The Munich disaster and the determination and recovery that Sir Matt Busby and co showed in the aftermath remains one of football’s most remarkable and inspiring tales. In lighter moments, it would be interesting to know exactly what The Hairdryer actually looked like. What was said in the United dressing room following their relegation in 1974, Denis Law’s goal for Manchester City and all. We might find out. Plus, Football Daily has always wanted to see a dramatic reenactment of thethe Battle of the Buffet.Who might play who? A proud and celebrated Scot who has already played Logan Roy – the Succession character who built and ran a global empire top to bottom (and hired his own kids) – Brian Cox would likely make a decent stab at Alex Ferguson. That’s not to say that the other Brian Cox, University of Manchester-educated physicist, should be completely ignored for a breakout role, especially as the former Oldham season ticket holder comes across as a little shy but still comfortable around bigger stars. He could play Denis Irwin, who joined United from the Latics in 1990.With his Northern Irish roots and love for Manchester United, James Nesbitt would be nailed on for George Best. Eric Cantona would obviously play himself, althoughSteven Seagalwould be a good backup for the unpredictable and mercurial Frenchman, particularly given his martial arts background. Gary Oldman has the gravitas to make a fine Busby and while Brooklyn Beckham recently stated he did not “want a life shaped by image, press or manipulation”, could the YouTube chef now be tempted to take his talents to the big screen to give us a newbetrayalportrayal of his father’s career? And Frank Leboeuf, no stranger to the silver screen, would surely be perfect for Fabien Barthez, especially as the former Chelsea defender would probably look like he had never played in goal before.View image in fullscreenTimothée Chalamet: nailed on for it?Photograph: Chris Torres/EPAFor the starring role of Sir Bobby Charlton, Timothée Chalamet is just a combover away from playing the United and England great as a young man. Heclearly knows ball, can actually play (having previously been pictured at a tournamentwith Joe Gomezas a kid) and has already expressedhis love for the English north-east accent. Given that Ralph Fiennes was once an English patient, has won almost everything there is to win and has a famous brother whohas dabbled in international management, he would be an excellent candidate to assume the role of Charlton in his later years, should the budget stretch of course.

Absolutely loved your article on German words in international football (about the only field German football excels in). But in typical German fashion, allow me to point out the following aspects: ‘Raumdeuter’ translates as ‘space interpreter’ or, more loosely, ‘space finder’, with Pascal Groß of Brighton a typical example. And although ‘Kacktor’ has been used by footballers for ages, it was football journalist and entertainer Arnd Zeigler, who introduced the competition on his show ‘Zeigler’s wonderful World of Football’ and there is even merchandise advertising the ‘Kacktor des Monats’ (crappy goal of the month)on his website” – Holger H Arntz.As a Dutch citizen living near the German border, I’m in the lucky position that I can watch Zeigler’s wunderbare Welt des Fußballs. It’s a programme packed with funny stories and the love for this great game is quite clear. Not just the stories about the professionals, but also the amateurs on the bad pitches make it a must-see every Sunday evening” – Gerben van Sark.A lovely selection of Kacktors yesterday. If I may just add this wonderful first goal for QPRfrom Alfie Lloyd, the Mutter of all goalmouth scrambles, a last-minute equaliser with the keeper up in the box as well.

Is country music waking up?Emerging stars are starting to critique Trump’s immigration crackdown – defying the genre’s legacy of conservatismJustin KirklandThu 22 Jan 2026 11.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 11.51 ESTShareThanksgiving did not go the way that Frank Ray had anticipated.The country singer had invited his family up from Texas to Tennessee for the holiday, with plans to deep-fry a turkey, explore Nashville, and take in a show at theGrand Ole Opry. But on Thanksgiving morning, Ray received an unsettling call: TSA had flagged his sister’s husband, Juan Nevarez-Porras, at El Paso international airport due to insufficient documentation required to fly.Born in Mexico, Nevarez-Porras has lived in the United States for 20 years, is a green-card applicant, and recently received a renewed five-year work authorization – which is still listed as an acceptable travel document, according to the TSA.ICEdetained him shortly after, while his son, who is 16 years old and a US citizen, was taken into the custody of border patrol. In Tennessee, Ray’s family was at a loss as to how to remedy the situation.Frank Ray.Photograph: Ari LyonAs theUS immigrationcrackdown continues, stories like Ray’s have become disturbingly familiar. They also have all the makings of a country song: snapshots of American hardship and heartbreak, of working men and women whose oppression is laid bare by guitar and melancholy melody. Decades ago, Merle Haggard’s The Immigrant and Dolly Parton’s cover of Woody Guthrie’s Deportee advocated for the rights of Mexican immigrants in America. Ray himself waded into the topic of immigration in 2023 with Jesus at the Taco Truck, written and performed with Shy Carter, about a man named Jesus with scars on his feet and hands from crossing the Rio Grande.Did you hear it on the radio? Probably not. That’s because anything considered mainstream in the genre shies away from social commentary that doesn’t pass the sniff test of conservatism. On the Billboard Top 20 for country music, heartbreakis served with a shot of tequila. Country’s most powerful names – Lainey Wilson and Ella Langley, Luke Combs and Morgan Wallen – make reference to Texas but shirk addressing the immigrant experience there.(Ironically enough, the only politically tinged song charting right now is Cody Johnson’s cover of the Chicks’ Travelin’ Soldier; more on them later.) For a genre that gestures at being the voice of Americana, country seems determined to ignore one of the biggest stories in America right now.It’s like the Toby Keith-ification of country musicBryan AndrewsThis makesZach Bryan’srecent foray into anti-ICE territory all the more interesting.At a Bryan concert, you’ll find rough and tough blue-collar guys, as well as an army of young women, fervent as the Swiftie fanbase, screaming out lyrics about grief and loss and military service. Though largely shunned by country establishment, Bryan’s honest storytelling and Americana bona fides have struck a nerve: he recently broke a US concert attendance record previously held by George Strait, and his new album debuted at No 1 on the Billboard 200 chart this week.In October, Bryanteased a verse off Bad News, singing that “ICE is gonna come bust down your door / Try to build a house no one builds no more,” to the ire of Trump administration officials. The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem,toldthe rightwing podcast host Benny Johnson: “I hope he understands how completely disrespectful that song is not just to law enforcement, but to this country, to every single individual that has ever stood up and fought for our freedoms.” For context, Bryan served in the US navy for eight years.Bryanansweredby explaining in a post that the song “hits on both sides of the aisle”. He later added: “Left wing or right wing, we’re all one bird and American. To be clear, I’m on neither of these radical sides.” But this both-sides-ism felt incongruent with the song’s scathing message, heard in full for the first time on 9 January: law enforcement, ICE, and the onslaught of gun violence in America are contributing to the “fading of the red, white and blue”. (Bryan’s team declined an interview offer.)This was a clear criticism of ICE raids and the fractured state of American communities, from a genre all but devoid of them. Was it enough to overcomethe muffling effect of Bryan’s call for unity?“For artists of his size, yeah,” said Bryan Andrews, an emerging Missouri-based country artist. “I mean, he might’ve lost some fans over it, but he put the song out anyway, so it’s not like he gave a fuck. I respect the hell out of him for doing it. I just wish he wouldn’t have followed it up the way he did.”Andrews has gone viral for his TikTok tangents skewering Donald Trump, ICE and bigotry in a thick southern drawl – he calls them “crash outs”– and he has released politically charged songs that reference the Epstein files and wealth inequality. But he recalls a period when he felt it was more advantageous for his music career to stay quiet. Last year’s ICE raids changed that. “I was like, I have to write about this,” he said. “Whether you’re here legally or not, we still have to offer due process because we have a constitution.”His message to the country genre now is: “Grow some fucking nuts.”View image in fullscreenBryan Andrews.Photograph: Claire Schmitt“I’m sick and damn tired of watching people like Jason Aldean say stupid shit like, ‘If you don’t like it here, leave,’” Andrews said, referring to Aldean and his ilk’s protestations against woke-ism and outsiders. “It’s like the Toby Keith-ification of country music.” After 9/11, Keith helped popularize an onslaught of patriotic fervor, with singles such as American Soldier serving as propaganda for the war in the Middle East. In the years since, country has been littered with tracks like Aldean’s Try That in a Small Town about old ladies being carjacked and unnamed authorities rounding up people’s guns – a fearmongered mythology of a community coming together to protect itself from the monsters of sensationalist headlines.“What I see in a small town [is] single moms who have to work two jobs because the corporations they work for don’t pay them enough to fucking be able to feed their children,” said Andrews. “I see farmers who fucking end up having to file for bankruptcy because they can’t afford the fucking trade war that Donald Trump has fucking put us in.”In 2003, the Chicks’ lead singer Natalie Maines spoke against the war in Iraq and declared: “We’re ashamed that the president of the United States is from Texas.” The band became pariahs overnight. “Country artists saw what happened to them and went, ‘OK, I’m not doing anything controversial. I want to have a career,” said veteran journalist and country music historian Robert Oermann. “That has only intensified under the Trump administration … Popular culture is something that he cares about, and he wants to restrict it.”Verified federal accounts have liberally used unlicensed music, including Bryan’s fan-favorite hit Revival, tosoundtrackits anti-immigration propaganda. In doing so, the administration hasrun afoulof artists such as Sabrina Carpenter, Olivia Rodrigo, SZA and Jess Glynne, who have sniped back.But country’s legacy of outspokenness still rests on a select few. Like Tyler Childers, who seemed to stand in solidarity with immigrants when he performed Long Violent History – a song about racism, largely influenced by the Black Lives Matter movement – for the first time live at his Los Angeles concert after Trump’s deployment of national guard troops there. Or folk singer Jesse Welles, whose witty protest songs have gone viral a few times over, and who performed his pointed trackJoin ICEon The Late Show With Stephen Colbert in November (sample lyric: “If you’re lackin’ control and authority / Come with me and hunt down minorities / Join ICE”).Oermann believes we have only started hearing timelyimmigrationnarratives play out in country song. “Today, the genre evolves faster because of the internet,” he said. “But to ask somebody to have an ICE song out already besides Jesse [Welles] is asking a lot.”That might be setting the bar low for what was once music’s most in-the-know genre. Loretta Lynn’s The Pill was banned from radio in a time when radio was the main conduit to reaching fans. Keith’s Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American) debuted on the charts eight months after 9/11.And, it took less than a year for Bryan to write and tease Bad News in response to the mass uptick in ICE raids kicked off by Trump’s second term.In the immediate aftermath of his brother-in-law’s detention, Ray started making calls to arrange for his father to pick up his nephew. The exchange with a border patrol agent was tense. “We got into this little spat about policies and procedures, and then he wound up saying: ‘Hey, how about this? You want me to play the immigration card on your dad when he gets here?’” Ray’s father, also Mexican American, is an American citizen.I feel like if you’re here and you’re hardworking, you’re contributing to society ... then you’re good enough to be hereFrank RayAfter Ray leveraged his social media platform to spread awareness of his brother-in-law’s story, the assistant DHS secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement painting Nevarez-Porras as a criminal with a “rap sheet” that “includes battery, assault, criminal trespassing, and disorderly conduct”. Ray has acknowledged the instance of trespassing, but he maintains that the current system is one that “forgets that people are human”. While his nephew was reunited with the family, his brother-in-law remains in ICE custody in New Mexico.Before switching to music full-time, Ray served 10 years as a law enforcement officer. He says the identities he holds – Mexican American, former police officer and country singer – are complicated, with people assuming his stances on immigration or law enforcement before he can vocalize them.Urban cowboys, harmonica wizards and queer trailblazers: 100 years of the Grand Ole Opry, country music’s greatest institutionRead moreFor instance, he won’t go so far as to call for the dismantling of ICE. “I believe you can have problems with particular ICE agents or you can have problems with particular border patrol agents, the same way you can be pro-law enforcement but have a particular issue with a particular law enforcement officer,” he said. His pride in law enforcement will be on display in his upcoming single Hard to Be a Hero, which is about “what we consider to be traditional country music values … pro-law enforcement and pro-America and pro-God and Jesus”, Ray said. “Those are things I genuinely believe.”But his family’s run-in with immigration enforcement leaves him feeling frustrated. “I feel like if you’re here and you’re hardworking, you’re contributing to society, and if the government feels like you’re good enough to be taxed and they’ll take your money for it,” Ray said, “then you’re good enough to be here.”Explore more on these topicsCountryUS immigrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)featuresShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Photo ITAR-TASS/ITAR-TASS Photo/CorbisIn 1978, Soviet scientists stumbled upon a family living in a remote part of Russia. They hadn’t interacted with outsiders for decades. Almost half a century later, one of them is still thereBySophie PinkhamThu 22 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 18.11 ESTShareIn the summer of 1978, a team of geologists exploring southern Siberia found something rarer than diamonds. While searching for a helicopter landing site amid the steep hills and forested canyons of the western Sayan mountains, their pilot caught sight of what appeared to be a garden, 150 miles from the nearest settlement. Hovering as low as he could, he saw a house. No people were visible, but someone was clearly tending the garden. He and his geologist passengers were shocked to find a dwelling in an area long considered too remote for human habitation.When the four geologists set up camp 10 miles away, it was the mysterious homestead that was first in their mind. Who could live here? Were the inhabitants the last Mohicans of the Brezhnev era? The geologists ventured to the settlement bearing gifts – and a pistol, just in case. They were greeted by a disheveled old man dressed in patched-up sacking cloth. This was Karp Osipovich Lykov, the patriarch of the family. Inside a tiny, dark cabin, the geologists found Karp’s two adult daughters, Natalia and Agafia, weeping and praying. Four miles away, by the riverside, lived Karp’s two middle-aged sons, Savin and Dmitry. It soon became apparent that none of the members of this ageing family had interacted with outsiders in decades.None of the Lykov children had ever seen bread. But when the geologists offered them a loaf and some jam, they refused. “We are not allowed that,” they said, in a refrain that would become familiar to all their visitors. Natalia and Agafia were hard to understand, not only because of their archaic vocabulary but also because of an odd, chanting cadence that one geologist described as “a slow, blurred cooing”.The Lykovs were Old Believers, members of the Orthodox Christian schismatic sect whose history is deeply bound up with that of the forest and the countryside. The Old Believers emerged in the mid-17th century after Patriarch Nikon, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, amended the liturgy to bring it into harmony with the Greek Orthodox version. The reforms altered the spelling of “Jesus” – at a time when letters were understood as something close to the literal flesh of God – and changed the number of fingers to be raised when making the sign of the cross from two to three.Those who rejected these innovations became known as Old Believers. To the rebels, who soon broke into many different branches, Nikon’s reforms were a betrayal of the true Christianity. Their anger fed on broader social injustices of the era and was further stoked by the notorious lack of respect for Russian Orthodoxy shown by Peter the Great. A self-consciously westernising tsar, Peter preferred the gods Bacchus and Mars.In the early days of the schism, Old Believers were burned alive, tortured and imprisoned for their faith. Many were cast into pits in the ground. They believed that they bore a tremendous burden – the preservation of the true words of God – and their extreme ways of living reflected this sense of responsibility. As the whole world fell into sin, they maintained their purity. While they awaited the end of the world, they maintained strict rules about diet (for the Lykovs, no bread or jam), clothing, everyday practices and the adoption of new technology. Some Old Believers and other religious dissidents resorted to self-immolation. Whole communities locked themselves in their village churches and set them aflame.Others took refuge in the forest, the safest place to hide from the authorities and preserve their way of life without risk of contamination by the outside world. Many branches of Old Believers were “priestless”, meaning that a family could worship without the help of a professional man of God. For the most radical Old Believers, holiness was directly correlated to isolation. The highest holiness was the life of the hermit. In the Bible hermits retreated to the desert; in Russia they retreated to the forest. But they called the forest a desert, deriving the names for hermits and for monasteries from the same word. The forest was the wasteland of holiness, the emptiness of God.The enlightened Catherine the Great changed course, allowing the Old Believers to practise their faith openly. This led to a split between the Old Believers who wanted to remain “priestless” and those who decided to re-enter society. Those who continued to reject the authority of church and state told stories of a legendary place east of Russia – in Siberia, or perhaps in China – where the old ways had been preserved and the antichrist could never enter: an Old Believer Shangri-La. Some travelled to China in search of it.The 19th century saw renewed efforts to force the sectarians into conformity. But a nostalgic fascination also arose around the Old Believers’ capacity to preserve a lost past, most often in the forest. Wildly popular, acclaimed and influential in its time, Pavel Melnikov-Pechersky’s novel In the Forests was a literary monument to the Old Believers of the 19th century. It was stuffed with ethnographic detail and affectionate catalogues of local flora and fauna – for instance, plants with the poetic colloquial names “star- melting” or “white-moustache”.There was a bitter irony in the fact that Melnikov-Pechersky became the most famous fictional chronicler of the Old Believers. He was not only a writer, but also a bureaucrat responsible for investigating Old Believer sectarianism in Nizhny Novgorod, on the Volga River. Melnikov-Pechersky was studying the Old Believers with the goal of converting them. At first, the community loathed him for inspections and raids that broke up their chapels and monasteries and resulted in arrests and forced conversions to orthodoxy. He entered their folklore as someone who made a deal with the devil in exchange for the power to see through walls. But in the late 1850s he dramatically changed his position, eventually advocating for an end to their persecution.In Melnikov-Pechersky’s fiction and in other, similar works of the period, the forest functioned as a timeless space of holy safety for Old Believers and monks in search of God. Though early Orthodox missionaries cut down the sacred trees worshipped by pagans, the trees grew back and granted their protection to persecuted Christian believers. In one scene in In the Forests, Melnikov-Pechersky describes how 17th-century monks from the besieged Solovki monastery on the Arctic Circle were guided by a floating icon into the forest. Here the taiga – as the coniferous forests of Siberia are known – was the Russian analogue to the Promised Land of the Old Testament. Melnikov-Pechersky also linked the Old Believers to the Russian myth of the city of Kitezh, a tale about faithful Russians who summoned the divine drowning of their city to save it from Mongol invasion. Kitezh was preserved in Lake Svetloyar, the paradoxically named “Light Ravine”, abyss of happiness and resurrection, awaiting the arrival of the next world. In a similar fashion, Old Believers would wait in the forest for the end of the world and the arrival of the kingdom of heaven.In 1905, Tsar Nicholas II signed a law ending all religious persecution of minorities. This was a short-lived interval of total freedom for Old Believer communities, many of which retreated even further into the remote forests when the Bolsheviks took control and imposed state atheism.Until the 1920s, Karp’s family had lived peacefully in their Old Believer village in the remote Altai region. This mountainous and forested area of southern Siberia, close to the borders with China and Mongolia, was beloved by those who hoped to avoid the authorities. The Lykovs relied on their gardens, crops and cows, and on hunting and fishing. To avoid contact with sinful civilisation, they traded via middlemen who sold their pelts and fish and brought back salt and iron in return. But the natural conditions at the settlement were not ideal – it was too wet and foggy – and there were rumours that the new government was making a list of Old Believers.The Lykovs and four other families moved farther upriver, to an even wilder area. But this newest settlement was short-lived. In 1932, the Altai Zapovednik, or nature reserve, was created; its area included the new settlement. This made hunting and fishing there illegal. Old Believers were offered jobs on the reserve; if they refused, they were instructed to leave. For years the authorities turned a blind eye to those who refused to comply, but by 1934 the pressure was too great. The Lykovs packed up again.Flight into the wilderness was the safest refuge from the increasingly violent authorities, who were liable to shoot Old Believers at the first provocation, made plans to wipe out their remote communities, and came looking for their children, hoping to save them from a life lived in taiga isolation. During the second world war, the authorities combed the forest for deserters. But they never found the Lykov family. The deeper in the forest the Old Believers lived, the more holy they could become.Until the arrival of the geologists in 1978 – 44 years after they left civilisation behind – the Lykovs were sighted only once, by a group of tourists floating down the river in 1958. As the tourists passed, they saw Karp fishing, his emaciated wife sitting beside him. They apparently did not call out for help, though Agafia recalled that the family had been surviving on “rowanberry leaf, roots, grass, mushrooms, potato tops and bark … Every year we held a council to decide whether to eat everything up or leave some for seed.” A late, hard frost in 1961 had caused a family famine. The Lykovs survived on straw, their leather shoes and ski lining, bark and birch buds. The matriarch, Akulina, died of hunger. The family had eaten all their rye seeds in their desperation. When a single spike grew the next season, they thanked God for a miracle.When the Lykovs were discovered by the geologists, they were still furious with Patriarch Nikon and Peter the Great. Karp Osipovich called Peter “the antichrist in human form”. Even the recent world wars, known only vaguely to the Lykovs, were the responsibility of the vile Peter. When the geologists explained the story of the second world war to Karp, he shook his head dolefully and said, “What is this, a second time, and always the Germans. A curse on Peter. He flirted with them.”They had outdone themselves in their rejection of Peter’s turn to the west. Agafia, the youngest Lykov, had never seen a wheel. The family made fire with a tinderbox. Their only light was the sun or a torch, and they wore birchbark shoes and lived without salt. The family had begun their time in the forest with carrots, but one year all the seeds were eaten by mice. (The carrot seeds provided by the geologists helped remedy their ghastly white skin, the result of carotene deficiency.) The family subsisted on dried potatoes and pine nuts, stored in birchbark containers, as well as turnips, onions, peas and rye. Karp Osipovich thanked God for hemp, potatoes and pine nuts every day. He had overcome the Old Believers’ original hatred of potatoes, which had been introduced by Peter the Great and were denounced as “a diabolical, abundant, lecherous plant”. The Lykovs were proud of their ability to read their smoke-stained Bible, though it was so thoroughly blackened that the words were no longer visible. Akulina had taught her children to read and write in Old Church Slavonic, using a stick dipped in honeysuckle juice to draw blue letters on birch bark.Over time, the taiga had become an increasingly important source of calories, as the Lykovs reverted from a primarily agricultural life to one closer to that of Neolithic hunter-gatherers. They drank birch juice and ate wild nettles, wild onions, mushrooms, berries and fish.Only when they were very lucky did they manage to catch an animal in their primitive pit traps. In late August, the whole family climbed Siberian pines, harvesting nuts.View image in fullscreenWinter in the Altai mountains, Ust-Koksenskiy region, Russia.Photograph: oxygen/Getty ImagesDmitry Lykov was the family’s master tracker. He knew all the animal trails and he understood where to dig a snare pit; he was the one who got the first meat for the family, which also meant the first new leather and fur. He tracked Siberian deer and killed them with a pike. He could walk through the snow barefoot and sleep in the forest even in winter, dressed in clothes made from a burlap sack. He brought the others updates about the animals in the taiga, their only substitute for news of the outside world: the grouse whose babies had hatched, the squirrels huddled together against the cold. He made friends with a bear who took up residence nearby.But when Dmitry came down with pneumonia, his family refused medical help even when it was offered. They were not allowed that. In autumn 1981, Dmitry, Savin and Natalia all died. Dmitry died of pneumonia. Savin and Natalia’s causes of death are obscure; they may have fallen sick because of unfamiliar illnesses introduced by the geologists’ visits. Now it was only Karp Osipovich and Agafia.Karp had hoped to find a husband or another companion to live with Agafia. She spent a happy few weeks with her mother’s sisters, who invited her to live permanently with them in their village, but she returned to her father in the taiga and remained there even after his death. One distant cousin came and lived with her for a while, and they were married – marriage among priestless Old Believers being an enterprise undertaken purely according to the will of the spouses. But they quarreled about whether to kill a friendly wolf who had befriended Agafia’s dog. Agafia felt the wolf was no threat, but her husband disagreed. Soon he returned to town.On a trip to visit Old Believer nuns hundreds of miles away, she stopped in Abakan, a town with apartment buildings. She was dismayed to learn that cooking on a fire in the courtyard was not allowed, and that she had to use the gas fire indoors: a violation of her principles.The man who made the Lykovs famous was a journalist named Vasily Peskov. After his first article about the Lykovs, published in 1982, he was inundated by letters asking for more news about Karp and Agafia, or sending him gifts and money that he was to bring them on his next visit. By the time his wonderfully detailed, tender book about them was published in 1992, he had been visiting them once or twice a year for a decade.View image in fullscreenAgafia, centre, and neighbour Yerofei Sedov, right, with another member of the family.Photograph: Komsomolskaya PravdaThe Lykovs held an endless fascination for the Russian public. They were human buried treasure, a time capsule, Russian Rip van Winkles, living exemplars of a Russia that had disappeared long ago. The Lykovs had bypassed Stalin’s purges and had hardly noticed the second world war. At the same time, their experience of starvation resonated with some of the most painful episodes in Soviet history. Millions of peasants had starved to death during Stalin’s collectivisation of agriculture. During the wartime siege of Leningrad, a whole city had been reduced to boiling shoe leather to survive. Less dramatic forms of deprivation were familiar to almost all readers of Soviet newspapers. The Soviet government had never been good at providing a steady supply of high-quality food, and in the second half of the 1980s ration cards were reintroduced.Both stunningly exotic and remarkably relatable, the taiga family promised the possibility of living entirely outside corrupt, violent, uncertain modernity, at least for a while, and of preserving an ancient form of Russian tradition. Their story marched in step with Russia’s sense of national martyrdom, which stretched back for centuries, and with the idea that the more isolated Russia became, the greater its importance in world culture. The perfect emblem of endurance, faith, and self-sufficiency, the Old Believers were like an ark, preserving the essence of Russian culture through a great flood of catastrophe and modernisation.As Agafia and her father grew older, it became impossible for them to live without help. The Lykovs grew bolder in their requests of assistance from Peskov, the geologists, and by extension their many admirers throughout Russia. They relaxed their old rules, dressing in the clothes they were given (though only if they were brand new, used clothes being against the rules because of Old Believers’ fear of contamination). They traded candles for flashlights, cleaned the floor and their faces, and installed a hand-crank meat-grinder. They began using enamelled pots painted with brightly coloured berries.By the 1990s, the Lykovs were like a museum exhibit, or like former dancing bears moved to a wildlife enclosure. The illusion of wildness was sustained by constant interventions from the outside world. Agafia’s friends gave her an SOS button that she could use to summon a helicopter if she became ill, but she began to abuse the privilege. Someone had to explain to her how much it cost to send a helicopter into the taiga. It was the 1990s, the Russian economy was in tatters, and there was no money left to pay her bills.As the Lykovs grew more domesticated, much of Russia was being driven back to the land by social and economic turmoil. Gorbachev’s perestroika in the second half of the 1980s had been well-intentioned but poorly conceived. Criminals and entrepreneurs (there was often little distinction between the two) had exploited the glaring flaws in the government’s economic policies to enrich themselves by gutting state-run enterprises. Acknowledging the failures of the government to provide food for the population, Gorbachev expanded a program that made land available for “allotment gardens”, so that anyone who wished could grow their own food.View image in fullscreenAn Old Believers church in the abandoned town of Pustozyorsk, Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Russia.Photograph: Dmitri Korobtsov/Getty ImagesBy the time Yeltsin became president of Russia in 1991, a new class of immensely wealthy, ruthless entrepreneurs was emerging. Yeltsin’s policies would accelerate the rise of the men who came to be known as oligarchs. When he lifted price controls, rocketing prices left Russians unable to afford basic goods. Every Russian received vouchers that represented their share in the state-run enterprises that were about to be privatised. But most Russians were so desperate for cash or so unaware of the potential value of the vouchers that they sold theirs for a pittance. Most vouchers ended up in the hands of the enterprises themselves. A visitor to a community of Old Believers in the 1990s remarked admiringly that not one of them had received a voucher – they had refused to accept any. After all, they still lived without electricity. Independent of the state, they were invulnerable to its collapse. Here was another aspect of the Lykovs’ appeal.By 1995, the Russian government was out of money and Yeltsin needed funds for his re-election campaign. Through the “loans-for-shares” scheme, he essentially sold off Russia’s largest enterprises, including its oil and gas concerns. This cemented the position of the oligarchs, whose payments to Yeltsin bought them both Russia’s greatest economic assets and the support of its president. Russia was being sold for parts, the needs of ordinary people forgotten. After the 1998 economic crisis, life expectancy fell to just 58.9 years for men, an unprecedented decline for a country that was not at war. The change was due to a large increase in deaths attributable to social stress: heart attacks, strokes, suicides, homicides, overdoses, car crashes.When asked how they survived during this period, people often answered with one word: potatoes. Bags of potatoes were passed between relatives, friends and neighbours. Not even the skins were wasted. People slept at their fields near harvest time, guarding against potato thieves. In 2004, an elderly man in Novgorod oblast expressed Russia’s collective affection when he erected a monument to the potato. The inscription thanked Christopher Columbus and Peter the Great for bringing it to Russia. The world of the Lykovs, who thanked God for potatoes every day, felt surprisingly contemporary.During a television interview recorded for her birthday, in 2013, Agafia Lykova’s speech still had a lisping rasp, a cheerful lopsidedness. By this point it may have been lost teeth that were to blame rather than isolation. She has a generous mouth and a forceful, prominent nose; there is an inquisitive, childlike glint in her eyes. Despite her life of hardship and isolation, she looked no older in the interview than most 70-year-old women, and happier than many. She still travelled on skis to collect water from a deep hole in the ice on the lake, where tall, slender conifers stood sentinel on the precipitous slopes that surrounded her homestead.But with every year that passed, it was harder for her to live as she once had. With the help of the park ranger who is now responsible for her welfare, Agafia asked Oleg Deripaska, one of Russia’s highest-profile oligarchs, for a new home. Deripaska first grew rich in the 1990s by buying stakes in a newly privatised aluminium plant in the same region as Agafia’s settlement; he went on to expand the holding into the world’s largest aluminium company, Rusal.The mysterious novelist who foresaw Putin’s Russia – and then came to symbolise its moral decayRead moreIn 2021, Agafia moved into a new cabin built with Deripaska’s support. She invited Putin for a visit, though he did not take her up on the offer. She had never received a voucher, but she benefited more than many Russians did from privatisation. In 2023, the regional news aired a video of her in her log cabin, receiving the more modest birthday gift of a grey woollen shawl from the park ranger. It was again wartime for Russia, but Agafia seemed unaware of that fact.In 2025, there was a severe winter storm on Christmas Eve. Agafia was unharmed, but her holiday visitors were unable to fly in as planned. This did not mean she spent the holidays alone; she is now assisted by an Old Believer novice who arrived from Moscow, achieving a spiritual “feat”, a saintly act of self-sacrifice, through her service. Unlike the hermits of old, Agafia and the novice now have a telephone to facilitate communication with the press and rescue services. One former regional governor complained recently that Agafia’s upkeep, notably the delivery of groceries by helicopter, was costing the state millions of rubles, and that it was illegal to live in a national park. But Agafia’s status as a national treasure, the last member of an endangered species, outweighs such concerns.On YouTube, Agafia, the woman who spent much of her life without bread or wheels, is a paradoxical superstar. Videos about her garner millions of views. There is even an unconvincing AI-generated account in her name that pretends to be her own video diary. Her popularity testifies to the allure of self-sufficiency in the wilderness – even as the last chapters of her story show that long-term survival alone in the taiga is only a fantasy.The Oak and the Larch: A Forest History of Russia and Its Empiresis published by William Collins in the UK andW.

Can the government let this happen? Keir Starmer,who has voted in favourof the legislation, needs to summon the spirit of Harold Wilson’s 1960s reforms. He has the powers to push it through, whatever it takes.If the Lords block this, it should be their last gasp. Their outrageous behaviour illuminates everything grotesque about the upper house. There is no telling with any certainty how the vote would go among this eclectic parade of 844 who range from good to very bad indeed, but plainly opponents of the bill think they would lose as they filibuster to prevent a vote at all. Back in the Lords tomorrow and then for seven more Fridays, at this pace there is no chance it will get through in time, unless the blockers give up immediately.The Tories plotting against the bill are a gleeful Lords reunion of the old Brexit gang – Michael Gove, David Frost, Mark Harper and Thérèse Coffey – reprising the same dirty tricks with the same cunning. They know the loss will humiliate Labour and Starmer, who gave time for this private member’s bill. Absurdly, opponents deny this is a filibuster, but watch them tomorrow in the Lords and see them talk very slowly, making identical speeches on identical or crass amendments. Last week, they piled into the preceding debate on the agenda to waste maximum time before assisted dying came up. I’ve never seen any of them show any interest before in a bill on rare cancers, but suddenly they grew loquacious.Some chief filibusterers, such as Ilora Finlay, are at least driven by religious belief. Tanni Grey-Thompson also fiercely opposes the bill, fearing ill treatment of those with disabilities, though research suggests a similar proportion of disabled people want the right to an assisted death as most voters.Despite never-ending negotiations and near-impossible conditions, opponents make zero compromise.Look how toughthe billis: those within six months of dying can ask for help (only in writing) to speed their ending, from two doctors seven days apart. After another wait, a panel of a psychiatrist, social worker and senior lawyer must agree, and the patient must be able to take the drug themselves with a doctor present. Many safeguards were added, andclinicians are free not to participate. Evidence from the many countries with similar laws shows that relatively few people use it, but most approaching death are comforted to know if the agony becomes unbearable, they can choose to end it.A reminder of what terrible deaths await the most unfortunate. (Don’t read this if you’re too squeamish to face the horrors some suffer, untreatable even by the best palliative care.) Professionals who see these things compiled a report, theInescapable Truth, revealing agonies hidden from most of us: “Some will retch at the stench of their own body rotting. Some will vomit their own faeces. Some will suffocate, slowly, inexorably, over several days.” An average of 17 people a day are dying these bad deaths, according to 2019 figures. Good palliative care works wonders, but not always. About650 suicidesof those who are dying are recorded every year; there may be more of these lonely, unassisted deaths.Amendments to the bill have been clumped into 84 groups. So far, only 12 have been debated, very slowly. Some are absurd beyond belief, some transparent attempts to waste time: amendment no 578 and eight others would replace “substance” with “substance and mixture”.No 458would make every patient take a pregnancy test. No 15 bars anyone who has been abroad in the last year, so forget a bucket list. Nos701 and 713suggest clinical trials for the “substance” used. How do you carry out a randomised control trial on a life-ending drug?Three-quarters of the publicback the right to die, and their lordships should rememberthere is also strong supportfor radical reforms that would remove most current incumbents. The 24 bishops are a small part of the unrepresentative religious peers on the red benches in this increasingly secular country. Expect their killing of this bill to stoke demand for an end to the Lords – a demand the government should listen to.The bill will die in mid-May, at the end of this parliament. The government could use the Parliament Act to force it through without the Lords, but it would pass in exactly the form it left the Commons, with no added amendments. And what a precedent to set before a possible Nigel Farage succession. Or the government could put it into the king’s speech for the next session, making it a government bill. There is no sign yet of either happening. It’s said that Starmer worries about two religious figures in his cabinet who are outspoken opponents, but Wes Streeting and Shabana Mahmood have had their shout and would hardly resign over this.Otherwise, any hope for this long-delayed reform relies on the luck of the next ballot for private members’ bills. Even if a supporter of assisted dying comes top, any MP may blanch at what this has done to Kim Leadbeater. For more than a year, her life has been consumed by the longest scrutiny committees, amid vitriolic hate from opponents, for authoring and promoting this most minimalist of bills.Over many years I have written about the right to die when we choose. After the Commons vote, I said: “I hope I never need to again.” But if the government lacks the spine, there will be a lot more to say.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But knowing there are famous people suffering steadies meRebecca ShawHow can a Normal understand what it feels like to turn my head and suddenly feel like the floor has smashed violently into my face?Thu 22 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 18.00 ESTShareAcouple of years ago I experienced something that turned my world upside down. I mean that literally (and I mean literally literally). I experienced vertigo. Specifically benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.I personally have a huge issue with the inclusion of the word “benign”, just because something isn’t going to kill you doesn’t mean it’s not going to make you feel like you might die. Trying to explain BPPV makes me sound like a spiritual healer, because it happens when tiny crystals in your inner ear shift out of place. Yes, tiny crystals. The shifting of the tiny crystals tells your brain that your body is tumbling in space, but in a fun twist – it isn’t. The earth can suddenly and completely jolt off its axis while you are standing still, let alone turning your head.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsThe power these tiny crystals have to mess up your life, not to mention your physical perspective, is unbelievable. I’d compare it to when you’re so drunk the room is jumping and spinning (assume we’ve all been there), combined with a theme park ride where you suddenly get turned upside down and your stomach drops to your throat. For this reason, discovering other people who have it and understand it is so validating it brings a tear to the (involuntarily moving) eye.My girlfriend is supportive as a partner, but completely baffled by my love of sports | Rebecca ShawRead moreI have been going through a vertigo episode recently, which sucks, but I also recently found out that another talented successful legend like me is afflicted: Australian cricketer Steve Smith. Smithrecently missedan entire test match against England because of vertigo. When I read about this I was sad for him, but I also … felt good. Vertigo has become an ongoing issue in my life, and I get some sympathy, but I could take a whole lot more. How can a Normal understand what it feels like to turn my head and suddenly feel like the carpeted floor has smashed violently into my face, simultaneously making me scream and vomit? Or how it feels to walk into a cafe on a rainy day, slip on the wet floor and fall down in front of everyone – activating my vertigo and causing me to vomit, also in front of everyone. Yes that’s real. I’ve seen a lot of my own vomit throughout this experience, and Steve Smith understands. He’s been struggling with vertigo for a while. In 2020 he said: “The doctor, I think he performed six Epley manoeuvres on me this morning and got the crystals out of my ears and I was struggling for a bit.”The Epley manoeuvre is a treatment where you deliberately give yourself vertigo by turning over and over in a specific pattern, in an attempt to send those crystals back to their little home. It helps a lot of vertigo victims like Steve, but unfortunately hasn’t worked for me. It’s like if you put the girl from the exorcist on the Gravitron. Vomit sprays out of me as I turn like a crying rotisserie chicken, while my poor girlfriend leaps around trying to catch it in a bucket (to win a prize). The last time I tried this I ended up in the hospital. The nurse checking me in had experienced vertigo, genuinely commiserated with me, and got me seen fast. This could also have been due to the fact that my vomiting sounds in the bathroom next door were reverberating powerfully around the waiting room. Sorry to keep talking about vomit but it’s an integral part of having vertigo.I feel a connection to Smith, and to anyone else who has suffered in the specific way we have. It works for other things besides vertigo of course. I recently saw aBill Hader interviewwhere he talked about how shingles should be a bigger deal and renamed “fire blisters”. I had shingles a couple of years ago – another, different pain hell – and I know how much bizarre and freakish nerve pain Hader was in.I’m sure this is the same for many people and many conditions. You have to find your way through it using all the tools you have. It doesn’t fix anything to know that other people go through it, even if they are famous, but it does make me feel a little bit less lonely – and that steadies me. Until I turn my head.Rebecca Shaw is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsSteve SmithOpinionHealth & wellbeingHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

For nowMohamad BazziAfter a bombastic speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump backed away from his threat to impose tariffs on European countriesThu 22 Jan 2026 13.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 18.58 ESTShareIn the past few days, Donald Trump turned the US presidency into a tool for his personal glory and vengeance. On Saturday, he threatened to impose tariffs of up to 25% on a bloc of European countries until Denmark agrees to sell Greenland to the US. The next day,Trump textedNorway’s prime minister, saying his failure to win the Nobel peace prize was one of the reasons he’s intent on seizing control of Greenland. After being snubbed for last year’s award, Trump said he no longer felt the need “to think purely of peace”.By Tuesday morning, as European leaders continued to absorb the shock of Trump’s threats and insults, the president posted anAI-generated memethat showed him planting a US flag on the island, flanked by his vice-president and secretary of state. “Greenland. US Territory. Est. 2026,” the image said. (Trump sharedanother image, also apparently edited by AI, that showed him sitting alongside a map of the US that includes Canada, Greenland and Venezuela, as he spoke with European leaders assembled at the White House.) Later on Tuesday, when he was asked at a press conference how far he was willing to go to acquire Greenland, Trump responded tersely: “You’ll find out.”On Wednesday, after a bombastic speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump backed away from his threat to impose tariffs on European countries and said he had reached “the framework of a future deal” on Greenland with the Nato secretary general. In other words, Trump began to defuse a global crisis of his own making.Over the past year, the world watched Trump’s second term devolve into abrazen campaign of self-enrichment. He has exploited the presidency tomake himself and his family richer, bullied allies and enemies alike into accepting his coercive and erratic foreign policy, and sullied the US’s image around the globe.Trump’s campaign to seize Greenland from Denmark is the endpoint of his transactional and corrupt approach to governing since he returned to office: an attempt to use the immense financial and military power of the American state to strong-arm a property deal that he believes will enhance his legacy. What other modern real estate mogul can claim to have achieved such a prize, securing a territory of 836,000 square miles – three times the size of Texas?Until his meetings in Davos, Trump had shown little interest in negotiating agreements with Denmark and other Nato allies to expand theexisting US military presencein Greenland, which could include adding bases, radars and ballistic missiles. He had set his goal as nothing short of US ownership of the Danish territory.In an interviewwith the New York Times earlier this month, Trump explained his outlook on control of Greenland in real estate terms, preferring outright ownership to a lease agreement or treaty. “Ownership is very important,” he said, adding: “Because that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success.” When asked if he meant ownership of Greenland was important for himself or for the US, Trump responded: “Psychologically important for me.”It’s the latest example of how Trump, thefirst convicted felonelected president, unleashed his basest instincts in his second term: the state exists to serve the ego of its leader, and if the world refuses to validate him, the world will pay a price. If Denmark continued to insist it won’t sell Greenland, Trump hadrefused to rule outusing military force to seize the territory – until he did so in his speech at Davos.He was also emboldened by the quick US military operation on 3 January that captured Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, with no American casualties. For Trump and his sycophantic aides, US foreign policy is now based on the worldview of might makes right – and they think Europe and itsleaders are too weakto resist American military and economic dominance.To achieve his grand territorial ambitions and soothe his bruised ego over the Nobel peace prize, Trump is willing to fracture the nearly 80-year-old Nato alliance, instigate a transatlantic trade war with Europe, and perhaps even trigger a military confrontation with US allies.How did we get here?When he returned to office last year, Trump gutted federal agencies, fired tens of thousands of government workers and issued dozens of executive orders intended to expand his power. He also rushed to dismantlemany of the lawsand other anti-corruption safeguards put in place by Congress after the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. Trumpfired 17 inspectors generalwho had served as ethics watchdogs over various agencies. He appointed loyalists to run the justice department and FBI, and circumvented Congress toinstall his alliesas top federal prosecutors across the country. Within a few months, Trump had dismantled many mechanisms of accountability designed to impose ethical and legal boundaries – and constrain past US presidents.With little outrage or resistance from Congress and the rest of the political establishment in Washington, Trump was emboldened to expand presidential authority and ignore norms set by his predecessors. Fearful of angering the president and his Maga base, the Republican majority in Congress allowed Trump to infringeon its authorityover government spending and agencies.The US supreme court also paved the way for Trump’s power grab,issuing a rulingin July 2024 which gave him “absolute immunity” from prosecution for his official acts as president. The court’s conservative majority – which Trump helped create by appointing three of its justices during his first term – ruled 6-3 in his favor. In a dissent that now seems prescient, the liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor criticized the majority’s decisionas a “mockery”that could turn the US president into a “king above the law”.“Let the president violate the law, let him exploit the trappings of his office for personal gain, let him use his official power for evil ends,”Sotomayor wrote, citing a leader who might order the US military to assassinate a political rival, organize a coup to hold on to office, or take a bribe in exchange for a pardon – and still receive immunity for all of these acts. She added: “Even if these nightmare scenarios never play out, and I pray they never do, the damage has been done … In every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law.”The lack of checks on Trump, and immunity from potential criminal prosecution, has allowed him not only to reshape the US government and expand his power, but also enabled him to profit from the presidency in unprecedented ways. Thepresident is exemptfrom conflict of interest laws that prohibit federal employees from exploiting their positions for personal profit. Since the Watergate cover-up, which forced Richard Nixon to resign the presidency in 1974, every US president had voluntarily abided by these rules. But in his first term, Trump refused pressure to divest from his business ventures, and argued that his sons had taken control of the Trump Organization.In his second term, Trump has monetized the presidency to an astounding level. By some estimates, he has used the office to makeat least $1.4bnfor himself and his family. That includes millions of dollarsin licensing feespaid to the Trump Organization as part of more than 20 foreign real estate projects, some of which involve foreign governments seeking favor with the US administration. (The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has responded by saying: “Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.”)The largest windfall for Trump has come from new cryptocurrency ventures, especially a $2bn stablecoin project with an investment fund backed by the government of the United Arab Emirates.That project, which could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in profit for the president’s family, was announcedtwo weeks beforeTrump allowed the UAE access to buy advanced computer chips critical for AI development.With no guardrails or opposition to prevent Trump’s massive power grab and personal self-enrichment, is it any surprise that he had threatened US allies with economic warfare unless they agreed to sell Greenland and help him achieve his territorial conquest? Trump is transforming the US from a superpower into a protection racket ruled by his whims.For the past year, Trump has grown more vindictive, narcissistic and erratic – and a greater danger not just to America, but to the world.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS foreign policyTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Perhaps you were busy having a life in December and missed it. But this week’sexplosion by Brooklyn Beckhamwas the culmination of a chain of events triggered last month when Victoria Beckham, advisedly or otherwise, chucked alike at her son’s videoof a roast chicken on Instagram.For some, the takeaway was that Brooklyn’s chicken looked undercooked. For others, it was a reminder that you could draw a face on a balloon and achieve roughly the same level of sentience as Brooklyn in his cooking videos. All of which was to miss the point: that according to the new semiotics of family alienation, Brooklyn’s mother, by liking his post, had crossed a fraught boundary between “NC” (no contact) with her son to “VLC” (very low contact). Had Brooklyn not blocked her and the rest of the family immediately, she may have gone the whole hog and escalated to LC – “low contact” – at which point all bets would’ve been off.These terms derive from burgeoning online communities in which adult children estranged from their parents gather in groups for mutual support. This kind of alienation isn’t new; it probably goes back as far as the family unit itself. What’s unique to the era of gen Z and millennial kids cutting their gen X and boomer parents out of their lives is codification, an attempt to legitimise and name a traumatic experience in an effort to remove stigma and guilt from painful decisions.It’s a Brooklyn v Beckham Inc disaster: what happens when the elephant in the room goes rogue | Marina HydeRead moreIt is the weight of these decisions – the question of whether they are being increasingly flippantly, if not petulantly, made – that critics of the “no contact” movement call out. As you would expect in an era in which terms formerly used by psychiatrists are bandied about by all of us, parents in these groups stand accused by their estranged offspring of an entire medical textbook of damaging behaviours including narcissism, borderline personality disorder, controlling and “high-conflict” behaviours, and gaslighting. And while there aren’t many examples of families driven apart by a business model premised on parental oversharing – to take Brooklyn’s rationale at face value – the Beckhams are, in other ways, typical: the damage inflicted by attention-addicted control freaks is a very common theme.On the other side of the dispute are various shades of the culture-war position: suck it up, snowflakes, we all make mistakes. (David Beckham put it slightly more gracefully this week whenhe said, cryptically, that “children are allowed to make mistakes”.) Personally, I don’t know anyone who has taken the decision to walk away from their family lightly. I’m also aware of people whose parents are life-wreckingly damaging but can’t bring themselves to walk away. In data cited in Anna Russell’s excellentdeep diveon this subject in the New Yorker in 2024, 27% of Americans are said to be estranged from a relative, while in Britain, charitiesestimate that 20% of familiesare affected by estrangement. These numbers don’t seem to me either excessive or surprising.And there are half measures. These, too, have helpful handles with followings on TikTok. One is called “grey rocking”, the practice of staying in contact with toxic family members while not being drawn in by their provocations, instead simply nodding, smiling and going along with what is being said, while taking none of it in and remaining entirely emotionally uninvolved. (It strikes me that large numbers of men nail grey rocking without even realising it.)But back to the Beckhams. It is a measure of Brooklyn’s limitations that the method via which he chose to attack his parents for living on Instagram was a series of Instagram stories. Anyone seeking further insight into the Peltzes, meanwhile, might enjoy spending half an hour browsing thecounter lawsuitfiled by Brooklyn and Nicola’s wedding planners in response to the suit Nelson Peltz, Nicola’s father, brought against them. Put it this way: as personality types go, the Peltzes seem every bit as lovely – even more lovely, perhaps – as the Beckhams.Elsewhere, there are early indications that accused parents are fighting back.Doormat Momis a social media account set up by 59-year-old Laura Wellington after her daughterfailed to invite her to her weddingand which now has 140,000 followersacross various platforms. “Were you a really good parent who did the best they could and yet your child has decided to be an ungrateful little bastard as an adult?” says Wellington in the opening video. “We need to connect here. We need to support each other, and we need to talk about it.” Victoria and David: your support group awaits.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBrooklyn BeckhamOpinionDavid BeckhamVictoria BeckhamParents and parentingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

It shouldn’t be too much to ask. And yet, if the polls are to be believed, the United Kingdom is in a very interesting position. By the end of May, it is likely that the largest party in three of the four constituent countries of the UK will want the larger polity in which they operate to break apart.The SNP is currently theoverwhelming favouriteto have the most seats in the Scottish parliament in the upcoming elections. In Wales, there was polling last week suggesting that the Welshnationalist partyPlaid Cymru was on course to be the largest party inside the Welsh Senedd, justfour seats short of a majority. Even more astonishing is that the Welsh Green party was also predicted to get 11 of the 96 seats. This would mean that there would be a majority of parties inside the Welsh parliament whose official policy was for Welsh independence. In Northern Ireland, the party with the most seats at present is Sinn Féin.Now, if you were an introspective member of the UK government you might think, “Hmmm, clearly something isn’t working here. IfWales, which has long been apathetic to independence, is flirting with the idea, perhaps we need to have a rethink?” But of all the things you can call the Starmer administration, “introspective” is not one of them. I know from conversations with Labour people that they see the support for the pro-independence Plaid and Greens in Wales as a “kicking of the establishment” rather than an endorsement of breaking up the UK. They point to polling regarding Welsh independence that has constantly hovered around the 30% mark in recent years.They are partly correct in this assessment. Many people who are planning to vote Plaid Cymru in the elections in May are not advocates for an independent Wales. You can see this by the fact that Plaid’s leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth, is deliberately putting talk about Welsh independence on the back burner as he tries to win over traditional Labour voters. Instead, he simply talks of a “higher ambition” of Wales.He told me last week: “I don’t think we’re quite in a place where we would win a referendum on independence.” But when you think about it, doesn’t this underscore more than anything that the UK, as currently constituted, isn’t working? Voters are willing to risk the UK itself, such is their level of frustration with the status quo.If you consider yourself a unionist and want the UK to continue, you should be very concerned that we are getting to a point where three-quarters of the countries within it have large numbers of voters that don’t want the UK to exist, or at least are willing to tolerate that outcome.So what can the UK government do about it? Well, ultimately you need the UK to work for all of its component parts, and have the structures of governance reflect the reality that it is a union of four nations. This has to start with recalibrating our preconceptions about how a state should look. The UK ishighly centralised. This doesn’t work for Wales,Scotland or Northern Ireland, but it also doesn’t work for many parts of England.At present, we have a ridiculous situation where the House of Commons doubles as both the parliament of the UK, and the parliament of England. The prime minister of England also doubles up as the prime minister of the whole of the UK. This is not ideal. The governor of California can’t also be the president of the US. There are clearly conflicting priorities.When it comes to funding, the current structures look as if they were drawn up on the back of the fag packet by a fresher at uni. We have a funding system for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that is entirely based on the spending priorities of the UK government in England. The Welsh government has less borrowing powersthan a local council, and it often publishes its final budget nine monthsinto the financial year, because the Treasury has decided to change funding in England. This doesn’t work. And it can’t work.While the system is failing Wales, it is perhaps even worse forcertain regions of England. At least Wales gets funding automatically allocated, whereas many parts of Englandhave to fightfor individual funding pots.At the start of 2024, the independent commission on the constitutional future of Walespublished its report, setting out 10 recommendations designed to strengthen Welsh democracy and protect devolution. It was led by Prof Laura McAllister from Cardiff University and the former archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. It called for better safeguards for devolution (at the moment Westminster can technically scrap Welsh democracy without any input from the people of Cymru); reducing the constraints on the Welsh government budget management; and the devolution of policing and justice – powers Scotland currently has, but Wales doesn’t.The best way to secure the future of the UK is to make it work for the people of the UK. To do this would involve a bold rethink of how we make it a state fit for the present day rather than the arcane hodgepodge of inertia and tradition that it currently is. Does the UK government have the energy to do this? Probably not. Does it have the intellectual chops to pull it off? I doubt it.It will probably argue that people don’t care about constitutional structures and instead want it to focus on “bread and butter issues”. But how the UK is constituted directly shapes how you can fix these bread and butter problems. Imagine if your house was on fire and you were trying to put it out with a Super Soaker. You would instantly realise that your tools aren’t up to the task and get a hose. Well, this is the situation we have in the UK right now. The houseis on fire, but the UK government insists on using just a water pistol, and then it wonders why people want to move out of the house.Will Hayward is a Guardian columnist.

That has consequences for us allNatasha WalterFor a decade, the autonomous territory in Syria has been a bastion of gender equality. It holds important lessons for the fight against authoritarianismThu 22 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 09.49 ESTShareAyear ago, I was in north-eastSyria, in the Kurdish-dominated area known as Rojava, listening to some of the most determined women that I have ever met. On my first day there, I went to a huge conference where one after another, women in Kurdish, Arab and Assyrian dress roused the audience to chants of “Jin! Jiyan! Azadi!” (Woman! Life! Freedom)!.When I visited, this region of Syria had for more than a decade been governed not by Bashar al-Assad’s regime, but by anautonomous administration(the Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, orDaanes). Itscommitment to equal rightshas been remarkable – every institution it set up relied on power-sharing between men and women. No wonder many of the women I met there sounded optimistic about their future. “This will be a century of women’s freedom,” one said to me. “We are in solidarity with women in resistance throughout the world.”Now, I’m getting messages from these women that speak of their despair. They say the future is dark. They speak of betrayal by the west. They say they face slaughter.This autonomous region is being throttled, as the Syrian government, led byAhmed al-Sharaa, is trying to bring the whole country under its control. The Kurds in north-east Syria are right to fear what that control would look like:massacres of other minorities, including Alawites and Druze, have taken place recently elsewhere in the country. Al-Sharaa, with hisbackground in al-Qaidaand desire for a centralised national government, represents the polar opposite of the secular, decentralised ideals of the autonomous administration.As government forces advance, theterritory controlled by the administrationhas already shrunk dramatically. Those parts of north-east Syria where Kurds are not in the majority have slipped away, and even the key Kurdish areas are under threat.The messages that I’m receiving from women in Rojava are heartbreaking. But they are also speaking of their ongoing determination to defend the achievements of north-east Syria. Nobody should dismiss their determination as mere talk. The region’s armies, led by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and including theWomen’s Protection Units(YPJ), the women’s army, fought to destroy Islamic State.As I write, a patchy ceasefire is holding and the administration’s spokespeople state they still hope that negotiations might bring about a settlement that preserves the rights and freedoms of theKurdsand other minorities. But there is no glossing over the fact that the future for the region looks bleak. And what happens there matters well beyond its shifting borders. Because Rojava has long had the power to inspire beyond its territory.Many anarchists and socialists have been galvanised over the years by the administration’s stated commitment to try to create abottom-up, decentralisedpolitical system. For sure, the administration often struggled to put these radical ideals into practice. Human rights abuses and repression of dissent were still reported; many Arab people in the region reported that power was, in practice, held only by the Kurds. It is important not to romanticise Rojava and to recognise that gaps existed between rhetoric and reality.But where its ideas worked out, they were transformative. They ensured decisions were taken closer to the ground, by those directly affected – whether that was the distribution of food in a displaced people’s camp or the reformation of the legal system with an emphasis on restorative justice.Meanwhile, the administration’s commitment to gender equality was clearly building a true counterweight to patriarchal practices. The feminism I found there was not the same as western feminism. Kurdish women drew inspiration from their own traditions – from ancient Mesopotamia towomen’s participation in Kurdish strugglesthroughout the region.The intellectual confidence among the women I met struck me hard – and I don’t mean just the writers or teachers. I mean all the women: from soldiers to judges, from women working in a textile factory to those on an agricultural committee. They were rereading feminist writers from Nawal El Saadawi to Virginia Woolf, Sakine Cansiz to Rosa Luxemburg, taking their ideas apart to see what they could use in practice, examining the limits of western liberalism when it came to women’s rights, and how feminism and socialism could work together.This energetic reforging of the theory and practice of feminism couldn’t be more alien to the forces that are now confronting Rojava. All the powers that are rising around the globe right now, from Donald Trump’s US to al-Sharaa’s Syria, from Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Turkey to Vladimir Putin’s Russia, are ready to trample women’s rights underfoot alongside their disregard for democracy.The question of how people can build a counterweight to growing authoritarianism has never been more urgent.Womenand men in north-east Syria have been putting their energy into trying to answer that question for years. And now it’s up to all of us who admired that energy to think about how we can show solidarity. That can involve using our voices to pressure our government to support the rights of women and minorities in the region, and to rein in the Damascus government’s repressive ambitions. It can involve engaging with the ideas and practices of direct democracy that characterise the region’s governance at its best. And it can also involve trying to build a more collective and confident feminism in our own societies.Natasha Walter is the author of Before the Light Fades and Living Dolls: the Return of SexismDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A notice in the staffroom suggested otherwiseThu 22 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 06.07 ESTShareIrecently spent a day at a secondary school in Birmingham. I agreed to do it because I like being in Birmingham and I like going to schools, and also because the teacher asked nicely. It was only the day before that I read the invitation properly and saw, to my horror, that I was leading what they call a Deep Learning Day. What could they learn from me? Moreover, what could they learn deeply from me?Whenever I go to schools, I always come away feeling that I’ve learned a lot more from the experience than any students have learned from me. This visit was no different. I came away enriched, but also completely knackered. I’m in awe of the stamina not only of teachers, but also of students. I mean, a whole day of learning, deep or otherwise, is exhausting. Whichever side of it you’re on, it’s a lot.A notice on the staffroom wall jumped out at me. Apologies to any teachers reading this, for whom the following might well be a hoary old maxim they’re tired of seeing. It went as follows:Learners remember 10% of what they read; 20% of what they hear; 30% of what they see; 50% of what they see and hear; 70% of what they discuss with others; 80% of personal experience; 90% of what they teach someone else.This all sounds about right to me, dispiriting as it is for someone who earns a crust writing things for people to read, and talking about things on the radio, only to find out that 90% of the former and 80% of the latter aren’t recalled at all. That’s a lot of wasted ink and keyboard taps and airtime. Disappointing. Disappointing too, for someone who used to present a lot of television, to read that what you see and hear at the same time scores rather better. Though I don’t much miss working on television, I do occasionally feel the need to tell myself that radio and writing are nobler arts which linger longer than television in the minds of the audience. Hmm. Not according to this they don’t.The high scorers here are fascinating too. They rather explain the power of the modern echo chamber. If 70% of what you discuss with like-minded people sticks, as well as 80% of your personal experience – what’s become known, without irony, as “your truth” – you can see how your truth becomesthetruth. And then there’s the strikingly high 90% recall you have of the point of view – valid or otherwise – that you’ve so diligently inflicted on others. Bit negative all this, I appreciate, but there you go.

It is the globe and laurels of the UN – only gold, because this is Donald Trump’s initiative, and showing little of the world beyond North America.The charter of the board,formally launchedin Davos on Thursday, suggests that this is less America First than Trump Always. It is not “the US president” but Mr Trump himself who is named as chair, for as long as he wishes. He can pick his successor, decide the agenda and axe whomever he chooses – even if they have coughed up the $1bn demanded for permanent membership. It is the institutional expression of his belief that he is bound not by law but “my own morality, my own mind”.The body was birthed in subterfuge: the UN security councilauthorised a board of peacechaired by Mr Trump to oversee administration and reconstruction in Gaza. Despite misgivings about the colonialist model and free rein given to the US president, thevagueness of the resolutionand desire to ensure his buy-in to a ceasefire won its passage.What the US has created is something entirely different. The board’s charter does not mention Gaza once. A man increasingly fixated on landgrabs now heads an “international peace-building body” to replace “failed” institutions. To what extent this is a serious attempt toencroach upon, if not supplant, the UN, versus a symbolic declaration of power and creation of another forum for polishing his ego,is unclear. Mr Trump appears to have overplayed his hand again. His claim that Vladimir Putin had joined (Mr Putin disagreed) made it easier for the UK and others to back away from an offer they were not supposed to refuse.Benjamin Netanyahu, another leader indicted by the international criminal court, will sit alongside the likes of Belarus, Uzbekistan and Hungary. Eight Muslim-majority states, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey, havetogether agreedto join. But traditional US allies are conspicuously absent. It is unclear how others can make themselves heard on Gaza’s future if they rightly shun a deliberate attempt to undermine multilateral institutions. But they must. The already difficult, almost impossible task of winning peace in Gaza and justice for Palestinians has been further compromised. With an executive board – featuring Tony Blair and Mr Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner – and a Gaza executive board containing regional officials, Palestinians are relegated to a fourth-tier technocratic committee.For 2 million Palestinians enduring a brutal winter amid the ruins and ongoing bombardment by the Israeli military, Thursday’s presentation of plans for the next 100 days by Palestinian and US officials at least suggests that the administration has not totally lost interest. Mr Kushner’s ambitious proposals will displease those on the Israeli right who want to displace Palestinians entirely. Increases in aid, the reopening of the Rafah crossing, repairs to essential infrastructure and the reconstruction of homes and hospitals are all desperately needed. But what will materialise and on what terms?Mr Trump’s real-estate fixation and desire to be applauded as a peacemaker may be the best hope of keeping him engaged, and reducing Mr Netanyahu’s sway. But the rights of Palestinians are being treated as an irrelevant detail. That cannot stand. Mr Trump has contempt for international law; others must continue to defend it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The laissez-faire approach to the boom in social media, handheld devices and other digital technology was arguably nowhere less suitable than when such machines were placed in front of babies. The Department for Education’s ongoingChildren of the 2020s studyhas found that 98% of two-year-olds watch screens on a typical day for more than two hours. Those who spent the most time had smaller vocabularies, and were twice as likely as other children to show signs of emotional and behavioural difficulties.Correlation must not be mistaken for causation. This is still a relatively new area of research, and much remains uncertain. But the findings of a recent survey by the charity Kindred Squared, combined with observations by teachers, are highly concerning. Answers from 1,000 primary-school staff revealed that 37% of four-year-olds arrivedwithout basic life skillssuch as dressing and eating in 2025 – up from 33% two years earlier.Some of these may have additional needs. And there is no suggestion from the charity that screens are the only issue. Stresses caused by the high cost of living, cuts to local early years services and other factors affect the quality of the youngest children’s lives. Butmany teachers, along with one of their unions, the NASUWT, believe that the impact of screens must be addressed, with parents as well as children encouraged to prioritise books and bricks over swipes and clicks.The World Health Organization recommends that children under two should not use screens at all. But even if such prohibitions are unlikely to be heeded by the majority, ministers could be more ambitious in making the case for a precautionary approach. The importance ofearly speech, communicationand emotional development should be clearly explained, and parents given support when they need it.Since global outrage was sparked earlier this month bynudification on Grok, and the ease with which such images could be shared on X, the debate around regulation has dramatically shifted. Over recent days,Kemi Badenochhas thrown her party’s weight behind an age limit of 16 for social media apps, followingAustralia’s example. With a number of Labour MPs sympathetic, the government is under pressure to agree.Those pushing for tougher rules are right that existing regulations are full of holes. Age verification should have been introduced sooner.Addictive featuresshould never have been allowed on children’s accounts. But in the rush to gain political advantage from the current spike in concern, there is a risk of issues becoming confused. When considering screens and preschool children, a key question is what other activities (books, toys, ballgames) are being replaced, and why this matters. Weighing the impact of social media and smartphones on teenagers involves different calculations. Nudification apps are a distinct problem. It could be argued that the new focus on under-16s risks distracting attention from the more general danger posed by sexually explicit AI-generated material.Ofcom’sprompt response to the Grok/X nudification outcry was welcome. Politicians and campaigners may be right that under-16s’ social media use should be restricted. Warnings about screens and toddlers should be heeded. The wider message of the past few weeks is that democratic oversight of the tech industry needs to accelerate.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus a letter fromAli OliverThu 22 Jan 2026 12.56 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 13.55 ESTShareThe government’s consultation surrounding whether to ban social media for under-16s responds to widespread concern about digital harms (UK ministers launch consultation on whether to ban social media for under-16s, 19 January). We in the Neuroscience, Ethics and Society (Neurosec) team at the University of Oxford contend that such investigations should extend also to whether young people should have access to generative AI. In the case of social media, ministers and commentators have focused on features like addictive feeds and age limits; our research team’s work with young people shows that we must also reckon with such considerations – among many others – in an era of AI-driven technologies.To be sure, concerns about mental health, social comparison and addictive design certainly apply when thinking about young people’s experiences online, but the digital world of 2026 includes far more thanInstagramand TikTok. AI-based chatbots are increasingly present in young people’s lives across a host of domains, from education to companionship. And adolescence is a formative stage for developing social understanding, one’s sense of identity and so on. This raises urgent questions, such as: at what age should young people have access to AIs simulating friendship or intimacy? What safeguards are needed to protect young minds from manipulation and dependency grounded in artificial “connection”?Any policy focused on protecting children must broaden its scope beyond traditional social media platforms, including all relevant technologies that affect young people’s development. Consultations should invite evidence from developmental psychology and AI ethics, and perspectives from young people themselves. Asking simply whether a platform should be off‑limits misses a deeper question: what kinds of relationships to technology do we want future generations to form, and at what age is it appropriate to begin them?Young peopledeserve thoughtful, future-aware policy, not merely reactionary fixes.Dr Madeline G ReineckeNeurosec, Department of psychiatry, University of OxfordA social media ban for under‑16s is the bare minimum that our government should be pursuing for children in the UK. Since my career as a teacher began in 2010, I have watched the mental health crisis unfold, while those in power have shown an alarming lack of urgency in tackling the safeguarding risks posed by social media. Politicians, parents and educators have got to help children to find and maintain real, deep connections in an analogue world. This doesn’t mean locking away all technology; it means regulating access to addictive and dangerous platforms at the peak of adolescent neuroplasticity and vulnerability.The answers are not new – sport, music, the rejuvenation of the youth club, simple role‑modelling – but those in power have got to take bold action to prevent the harms of social media being baked in for the next generation.Alexandra CocksworthDeputy head,Lord Wandsworth College,HampshireRecent articleson thegrowing calls for a social media banor greater restrictions rightly highlight that we are at a tipping point in this debate. In 2015, the Youth Sport Trust published the first of a trilogy of reports warning of a generation being held hostage by handheld devices. They’re connected 24/7, but lonelier than ever. Our recentClass of 2035 reportwarned that, without change, the situation will continue to deteriorate. In a decade’s time, if the current trajectory persists, half of children will be using screens for entertainment purposes alone for at least three hours a day. The need to reimagine childhood is clearer than ever – and the time for change is now.Ali OliverCEO, Youth Sport TrustHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

However, in stating that “All the reconstruction efforts so far are local”, it overlooks significant international involvement.Since 2018, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) has restored eight key areas of the medieval souk in Aleppo’s old city, with ongoing rehabilitation planned, reviving shops and covered markets. AKTC’s efforts have motivated traders to privately restore their own shops in peripheral areas of the souk, delivered according to local standards. UN organisations such as Unesco andUN-Habitatare also helping to restore elements of the city’s historic centre.An article published this month on theAga Khan Development Networkwebsite, headlinedThe Aleppo Souk, Crucible of Memory, describes this work. Alongside the loss brought about by the war, it also portrays a city where international restoration is bringing a genuine sense of cautious optimism to the ancient medina. This narrative is real and deserves attention.Luis MonréalGeneral manager, Aga Khan Trust for CultureHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

There is still nothing else like it, for the rawness of its emotions and the haunting quality of its visuals.Locked away for years in the British Film Institute’s vaults by Arden’s creative associate Jack Bond, apparently traumatised by Arden’s sudden death in 1982, the BFI bravelyreissued the filmin 2009. Unlike the makers of Hamnet andH is for Hawk, more recent viewers will have seen that Arden clearly did not have her sights set on Oscars, Baftas or any other mainstream prizes.But is it grief-porn or grief-art? Emphatically the latter, but it’s the art of that “other Britain”, where lips are never stiff, or upper, and everyone can hear you scream.Sean Kaye-SmithBristolExplore more on these topicsFilmWomen (Society)Women (Life and style)FeminismHamnetWilliam ShakespeareDeath and dyinglettersShareReuse this content"

The fact is Forest failed to perform and a stale display was typified by the chain of errors that culminated in the captain, Ryan Yates, scoring an own goal that proved sufficient to earn the hosts victory.A swell of the 2,100 away fans who made the trip to northern Portugal relayed their feelings to Sean Dyche and his squad, jeering the players on several occasions. At full time the question on supporters’ lips was a slightly more direct version of: what on earth was that?Europa League roundup: Jadon Sancho strikes to seal Aston Villa’s last-16 placeRead moreThings went from bad to worse on a disappointing evening when in stoppage time Elliot Anderson, part of a triple substitution midway through the second half, was given a straight red card for dissent. Forest fans were gravely unimpressed, though they had five shots on target and Braga none. The manner of the goal was painful if not comedic, Yates inadvertently diverting the ball past Matz Sels just 54 seconds after Morgan Gibbs-White saw his penalty saved by Lukas Hornicek.Dyche was disappointed with that “minute of madness” but the reality is their entire performance was below par. After the relative high of holding Premier League leadersArsenal to a drawat the City Ground last weekend, this marked a miserable low and it is now one win for Forest across their past eight matches in all competitions.Forest fans made their voices heard. “Yeah, of course, they’re frustrated,” Dyche said. “They want to do well in this competition. We want to do well in it. This is a great competition that the club has waited a long time to get into. Of course, I understand their frustration. There is a lot of expectation this season, I know because I lived in the area before I was manager, despite two managers and all the different players. They are still frustrated. It’s going to take time because we haven’t got magic dust.”View image in fullscreenOla Aina shows his disappointment after Braga take the lead against Nottingham Forest.Photograph: Luis Vieira/APKick-off at this striking stadium, carved out of a rock at the site of a former quarry with two lateral stands, felt a landmark achievement in itself given the biblical rainstorms in the hours before the game. But the pre-match excitement soon subsided. Forest made seven changes and the discernible weakness was in attack.Igor Jesus did not travel to Portugal after picking up a hip problem, leaving Forest without an orthodox striker after allowing Arnaud Kalimuendo to depart on loan for Eintracht Frankfurt, while Chris Wood is sidelined after knee surgery and Taiwo Awoniyi ineligible. So it was down to Dan Ndoye, a winger, to spearhead Forest’s attack and their lack of cutting edge was painfully apparent throughout. They are pushing through a move for the Napoli forward Lorenzo Lucca, who flew into England on Thursday to finalise a loan switch. Forest require a lift, and quickly.The visitors struggled to create chances but five minutes into the second half James McAtee, one of those given another chance, went down in the box under pressure from Gabri Martínez and the Croatian referee, Igor Pajac, awarded a penalty. There was a lengthy video assistant referee check and almost three minutes had passed by the time Gibbs-White stepped up to take the spot-kick. His right-foot penalty lacked conviction and Hornicek dived low to his left to push the ball away from his goal with his left hand.View image in fullscreenElliot Anderson (right) is sent off by Igor Pajac in stoppage time.Photograph: Zed Jameson/PAGibbs-White grimaced, Hornicek beamed. Braga flew forward on the counterattack and less than a minute later the ball was in the back of the Forest goal. Yates wore a look of disbelief after steering Ricardo Horta’s squared ball past Sels, the midfielder skidding into the netting as the ball bobbled into the net in slow motion.Just after the hour Ola Aina, who started at left-back with Nicolò Savona on the opposite flank, rattled the crossbar with a speculative, swerving effort from 30 yards but that in itself spoke volumes. Forest lacked invention and quickly tired of ideas. Worse still, they looked susceptible to conceding again. The Braga substitute Pau Víctor sent an effort against the inside of a post. Yates sent a header goalwards after Hornicek denied Ndoye from a tight angle, but it was all too little too late.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueSporting BragaNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Football’s hypotheticals cannot be dismissed any more | Nick AmesRead more“When the ball started rolling and the magic started we had virtually no incidents. For the first time in history also, no Brit was arrested during aWorld Cup. Imagine! This is something really, really special,” he said.“So it was a celebration, it was a party, and the next one in the United States, Canada and Mexico will be exactly the same. People want occasions to meet, to come together, to spend time, to celebrate, and this is what we try to give them.”In response to theFifapresident’s comments, the Football Supporters’ Association said: “While we’ve got Mr Infantino‘s attention, we’d like to point out that rather than making cheap jokes about our fans, he should concentrate on making cheap tickets.”Infantino said the finals would be “the greatest celebration of humanity”, despite human rights groups voicing concerns about a number of policies adopted by the Donald Trump administration, and went on to address criticism of ticket prices.Fifa said it had received more than 500 million requests for tickets during the most recent application window which ended on 13 January. The second-cheapest category for the final cost $4,185 (£3,100), with only a tiny percentage available in the cheapest $40 category, leading to intense criticism.“The tickets are not cheap,” he said. “We were hammered. I was hammered, I should say, because of the ticket prices, because they are so expensive. And the main critics were from Germany and England, of course. Now, No 1 in ticket requests is the US. No 2, Germany, No 3, England, because everyone wants to come and to participate.”Fifa has not released details of how the demand for tickets is spread between the 104 matches or cost categories, but Infantino confidently stated: “Every match will be sold out.”He said that because of Fifa’s ticket resale platform, “those tickets will probably be resold at even higher prices”.He added: “This is incredible, but it shows really the impact that it has. To give you another number, to compare this in 100 years of World Cup history, Fifa has sold around 50 million tickets in total. For this World Cup, in these four weeks we have the request for 1,000 years of World Cups at once.“This is unique, it’s incredible, but I think it shows really that people have trust in the organisation, probably trust in Fifa as well. Trust in Canada, Mexico, the United States. They want to travel. They want to go.”Infantino said reports that fans from certain countries could be denied visas to enter the United States were “not true”.Spectators from Haiti, Iran and Senegal in particular are expected to struggle to be granted entry to the US, but Infantino said: “The United States, Canada and Mexico will welcome the world next summer, and this is what we are looking forward to.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026Gianni InfantinoWorld CupFifaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

At the time, police said his death was being investigated as a possible overdose or suicide, and no cause had been made public.Toxicology report says late US chess star Daniel Naroditsky had drugs in his systemRead moreThe medical examiner’s investigation, conducted by Dr James R Lozano and obtained by the Guardian on Thursday, concludes that Naroditsky died from a probablecardiac arrhythmiacaused by undiagnosed systemic sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease that most commonly affects the lungs but can also involve the heart. Methamphetamine and kratom (mitragynine) use were listed as contributing conditions, though the report states that the levels detected were not considered toxic or lethal on their own. The manner of death was ruled an accident.According to the report, postmortem radiographic imaging revealed extensive granulomatous lung disease, findings that are “highly suggestive” of sarcoidosis.Cardiac sarcoidosiscan disrupt the heart’s electrical system and is a known cause of sudden death, sometimes without prior diagnosis or warning symptoms.The medical examiner noted that sudden unexpected death is the presenting manifestation in a significant proportion of cardiac sarcoidosis cases. No autopsy was performed, but investigators said the totality of radiographic, toxicological and circumstantial evidence supported the conclusion.Toxicology testing detected methamphetamine and amphetamine in Naroditsky’s blood, with the amphetamine present as a metabolite of methamphetamine rather than evidence of separate ingestion. Compounds associated withkratom, a plant-based supplement increasingly used for stimulant or pain-relieving effects, were also found. Review of North Carolina prescription records showed no prescriptions for amphetamines or methamphetamine issued to Naroditsky.The report states that there was no evidence of intentional or unintentional overdose, no signs of traumatic injury and no indication of foul play. Investigators said Naroditsky appeared to have died suddenly, without signs of acute distress.Naroditsky was discovered unresponsive on his living room couch by close friends Oleksandr Bortnyk, a fellow grandmaster, and Peter Giannatos, founder of the CharlotteChessCenter, where Naroditsky served as head coach and grandmaster-in-residence. Friends went to check on him after he stopped responding to calls and messages.In the days before his death, Naroditsky had been under intense public scrutiny following cheating allegations made by former world champion Vladimir Kramnik, claims Naroditsky consistently denied. The medical examiner’s report notes that investigators considered stress related to those allegations while evaluating the possibility of overdose or suicide, but ultimately found no evidence to support either.In a statement issued this week, Kramnik expressed condolences to Naroditsky’s family and rejected claims that his conduct contributed to the grandmaster’s death. He said that following Naroditsky’s passing, he and his family were subjected to harassment and death threats, prompting him to consider legal action.“I deeply regret that this profound tragedy was exploited by various individuals and groups to advance their own agendas,” Kramnik said. “There can be no justification for such immoral conduct.”The International Chess Federation (Fide)has said it is reviewingwhether Kramnik should face disciplinary action for public statements made about Naroditsky before and after his death. Potential sanctions include fines or suspension. Fide did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian following the release of the medical examiner’s report.Naroditsky’s death marked a devastating loss for American chess. A prodigy who learned the game as a child in California, he became a grandmaster at 18 and later graduated from Stanford University with a degree in history. Known to fans as “Danya”, he rose to prominence not only for his elite play but for his rare ability to explain the game with clarity, patience and warmth.He was one of the most influential figures of chess’s pandemic-era boom, amassing more than 800,000 followers across YouTube and Twitch through instructional videos and live commentary. He also remained an elite competitor, winning the US Blitz Championship only months before his death.Tributes poured in from across the chess world after his passing. Magnus Carlsen called him “a resource to the chess community”, while Hikaru Nakamura described him as “the best of us”.

With Ben Duckett and Joe Root hitting watchful half-centuries, the base was set on a turner, chasing a target of 272.But the discontent continued as 129 for one turned into 165 for six, Sri Lanka’s spinners ripping everything apart under lights in the first of three ODIs. The left-armer Dunith Wellalage combined his 12-ball 25 with two wickets in the collapse as the hosts, chasing their ninth consecutive ODI series win at home, triumphed by 19 runs.Luke Wright to leave role as England cricket selector amid Ashes falloutRead moreThe numbers are grim for England’s 50-over side. This was their 11th consecutive away loss, Harry Brook’s reign blending into the final, miserable days of Jos Buttler’s time. The latter was at the other end as Rehan Ahmed played some of the shots of the night in a briefly promising seventh-wicket stand, and the rescue suddenly felt alive again with Jamie Overton’s late burst of 34. With 20 required from the final over, it was doable – but a clunk off Pramod Madushan’s full toss killed it.“The pitch got a little bit more extreme, it was proving very difficult to start as a batter out there,” said Brook of the defining middle passage. “Ducky and Rooty made it look fairly easy when they were set and going but they both came off and said it was hard to start on there; just getting used to the turn, bounce and sometimes the lack of spin when it just skids through.”The afternoon began with some promo for the upcoming T20 World Cup, co-hosted by Sri Lanka, with skydivers from the armed forces landing on the ground with the trophy. But the slow stuff was always going to be the real show under the stifling Colombo sun, so it was not a surprise that the new-ball passage was quiet for England. Overton, usually a middle-overs enforcer, opened up alongside Sam Curran as Sri Lanka’s openers batted through the powerplay.Curran realised that turning into a spinner was the way to go; his moon ball – a dipping, deceptive innovation – had Pathum Nissanka chipping to mid-on before Adil Rashid settled in. The leggie struck in his second over with a googly that went around the legs of Kamil Mishara, setting him up for very neat figures of three for 44. Liam Dawson, playing his first ODI since November 2022, was even tidier, conceding just two boundaries and dismissing Pavan Rathnayake.The sweep went wrong for three of Sri Lanka’s batters including the captain, Charith Asalanka, who was left confused by his swipe against Ahmed; while checking for traffic on both sides of the road, the ball lobbed up to slip, Brook moving to collect. But Kusal Mendis remained comfortable playing square, the late cuts getting him moving after two runs off his first 15 deliveries. An unbeaten 93 boosted his excellent recent record at home: an average of 67.25 in 20 games since the start of 2024.View image in fullscreenKusal Mendis on his way to an unbeaten 93 against England.Photograph: Eranga Jayawardena/APSri Lanka’s flourish at the back end of their innings coincided with a swelling of home support, cheers at their loudest, flags at the highest as Wellalage swung away to all sides and Overton went for 23 in the final over. On a ground that does not really do 300-something totals, Sri Lanka had control.Out came England’s Test openers for a hit in pyjamas, but the rhythm was the same as the Ashes: an early breakthrough for the opposition. Asitha Fernando’s setup was simple but effective, a nip-backer followed by a wide, away-swinging delivery. Zak Crawley, on six, threw his hands and edged behind.Duckett could not get his reverse sweep right, failing to make proper contact with a couple of Dhananjaya de Silva’s off-breaks. It spoke to his scratchiness. Root provided greater fluency but shared a similar gameplan, going hard with singles as England opted for some old-world graft. They both reached 50 in the same over. For Root, this felt standard; for Duckett it was a release, his first competitive half-century since the fifth Test against India last summer.Sri Lanka had curiously rested their primary threat with the ball, the wrist-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga. Maheesh Theekshana, third in the ICC rankings, was absent as well, but the others eventually clicked. Another attempted reverse sweep cost Duckett on 62, trapped leg-before by the leggie Jeffrey Vandersay. When Root departed lbw for 61 to De Silva, England were not yet halfway to the target, the required rate climbing.Cue serious trouble. Brook, on six, was undone by sizeable turn after coming down the pitch against Asalanka, stumped down the leg side. “It was like it hit a rock or something, it spun miles,” said the England captain. “It was a good bit of bowling, he’s obviously seen me come down, dragged his length back a bit and a good bit of keeping as well.” Ahmed – filling in for the unwell Will Jacks – lit up the skies with his 27. Overton demonstrated his power as well but the collapse was too severe.Explore more on these topicsCricketSri Lanka cricket teamEngland cricket teamnewsShareReuse this content"

As much fun as it may be to imagine Borthwick rocking up at Twickenham in a sharp navy suit, ice-white trainers and with a few selection bombshells in his pocket, the England head coach is not about to borrow from the playbook of his France counterpart, Fabien Galthié.Galthié’s decision to omit Damian Penaud, Grégory Alldritt and Gaël Fickou has created such a stir because it is radical by any measure but the point here is that Borthwick’s squad, in comparison with England’s closest rivals for theSix Nationstitle, is significantly more settled. He has a couple of injury concerns, as is always the case at this time of year, and he is expected to reward the recent form of Exeter’s uncapped Greg Fisilau with a call-up, but what is likely to be most telling is how few surprises it contains.The Breakdown | England prepare to reveal Six Nations hand with Borthwick aware of ticking clockRead moreThat is not to criticise Borthwick, to paint him as a bland selector, because the teams he has picked in the most recent couple of years show him to be anything but. Indeed, it is a compliment. When the squad lands on Friday, complete with a list of injury absentees and those called into camp for rehabilitation, it is not far-fetched to imagine that England’s 2027 World Cup squad will be made up entirely of the names mentioned.What fascinates is how and why Borthwick is in such a position. Part of the issue is that he is not Eddie Jones. He does not have a twinkle in his eye on days like this. The determination to pick a couple of rookies whose names require Googling for the sole purpose of ruffling feathers. Equally he is not someone who leaves senior players out to prove a point, for he is not a coach who needs his players to thrive in a constant state of discomfort. By comparison, at this stage of the 2019 World Cup cycle, Jones named 18 players in his Six Nations squad who did not go to Japan. Granted he had a lengthy injury list but Jones had also just signed a contract extension and relished causing a stir. Lewis Boyce is among those selected still waiting for a first cap while Gary Graham’s England career was short-lived before aligning himself with Scotland.When it comes to Borthwick, however, his depth charts are clear. All the more so after a summer tour of Argentina and the US with so many players away with the British & Irish Lions, while the resurrection of the England A side means rabbits being pulled from the hat is an even less likely proposition. It is unfair but Borthwick suffers when compared with Jones on days like this. The sense of anticipation is not what it was when put up against Jones – rogue, rascal but with the golden touch in his most prosperous years with England. The irony is that Borthwick’s boldest selection call in the autumn was to include the 19-year-oldNoah Caluori after five trieson his first Prem start – precisely the kind of player Jones would have overlooked on the grounds that he didn’t want to add to the hype.View image in fullscreenSaracens’ Noah Caluori was a bold Steve Borthwick selection in the autumn.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAIt helps Borthwick that he is selecting on Friday from a position of strength with England on a run of 11 straight victories. He has issues at tighthead prop but Joe Heyes came on considerably in the autumn, while he must manage a number of players who are injured but will hope to play some part in the championship such as Fin Smith, Tom Roebuck and Fin Baxter. There are, of course, a few either-ors in certain backup positions but, crucially, he does not have a clutch of players he needs to phase out before the 2027 World Cup. Jones did in 2018, those such as Chris Robshaw, James Haskell, Mike Brown and Dylan Hartley and the difficulty in doing so, in getting the timing right, almost cost him his job.Quick GuideOspreys owners Y11 poised to buy CardiffShowThe Welsh Rugby Union has named the Ospreys owners Y11 as its preferred bidder to take over Cardiff. The union and Ospreys said that if the deal goes through, Y11 would take ownership of both teams, though they would still operate independently. The WRU has been seeking a buyer for Cardiff since taking control of the club after it went into administration in April 2025.Both sides will now enter a 60‑day exclusivity period to finalise the terms of the deal and complete due diligence. “Our priority remains to support both teams, keeping everyone up to date with progress,” the WRU said in a statement.In response, the Welsh Rugby Players Association, said the update was sufficient to stave off any requirement for player action prior to the England v Wales Test in the Six Nations by securing players' future for at least the next 12 months. \"This represents a positive and timely further update ... providing welcome clarity for players and stakeholders ahead of the 6 February deadline,\" the statement read.ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Which brings us back to Galthié – who also evidently does – and more pertinently to France. Because, as much pain as it caused England in the immediate months after the 2023 World Cup, Borthwick has not had to phase players out mid-cycle, quite simply, because they upped sticks and went to France. He has not had to worry about bringing an end to the illustrious careers of the Vunipola brothers, Manu Tuilagi, Kyle Sinckler, Courtney Lawes or Jonny May because they did so themselves. In hindsight, Owen Farrell joining them has made Borthwick’s life considerably easier, too. Dan Cole and Joe Marler soldiered on but that was always a stopgap until the burgeoning crop of young props emerged and as a result Borthwick can see the road to Australia in 2027 clearly.In turn that means that days like Friday do not generate as much fanfare, which on one hand is a shame because rugby is a sport that could do with a bit more. Jones was always aware of that, though he also had players at his disposal whose names transcended the sport, those such as Danny Cipriani, and did not trust them. That Borthwick does not is another reason that Friday’s announcement may feel a little humdrum but it is not his fault an approach that values consistency puts him in a position that his rivals will envy.Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSteve BorthwickSix Nations 2026Six NationsRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dubbed the ‘Carney Doctrine’, the Davosspeech lamented the disintegration of rules-basedorder amid a rise of “great powers” that used economic “coercion” as a weapon.But his Thursday speech on the grounds of a famed citadel, built to fend off a potential American invasion, nonetheless laid out a defence of Canadian values and his vision for where the country fit into a rapidly changing world.Trump claims Nato troops ‘stayed a little off the frontlines’ in AfghanistanRead more“Canada cannot solve all the world’s problems, but we can show that another way is possible: that the arc of history isn’t destined to be warped towards authoritarianism and exclusion, it can still bend towards progress and justice,” he said.Carney’s remarks, largely written by the prime minister himself, included a jab at US president Donald Trump,who suggested earlier in the weekCanada was insufficiently “grateful” for the state of its economy, which he said was the result of American generosity.“Canada lives because of the United States,” Trump told attenders in Davos. “Remember that, Mark, next time you make your statements.”View image in fullscreenCarney also took time to pose with Bonhomme Carnaval, mascot of the Quebec Winter Carnival.Photograph: Mathieu Belanger/ReutersCarney said the two countries “have built a remarkable partnership” through their integrated economies, security agreements and shared values. But he also added: “Canada doesn’t live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian. We are masters of our home. This is our country.”Despite international approval for his blunt assessment of the “rupture” in the geopolitical order, Carney has faced pushback from opposition Conservatives, who say the prime minister’s recent trade missions to China and Qatar have produced little concrete investment and distracted him from domestic challenges.Carney pledged to move “fairly and fast” to speed up major infrastructure projects and to tackle the sustained cost-of-living crisis plaguing the country.

Maduro rejected the demand.By December, one American who was involved told the Guardian that Delcy Rodríguez told the US government she was ready: “Delcy was communicating ‘Maduro needs to go.’Dictator ousted but regime intact – what next for Venezuela’s opposition?Read more“She said, ‘I’ll work with whatever is the aftermath,’” another person familiar with the messages said.The sources say Marco Rubio, Trump’s secretary of state and national security adviser, at first a skeptic about working with regime elements, came to believe that Delcy Rodríguez’s promises were the best way to prevent chaos once Maduro was gone.The pledge of cooperation by Delcy and Jorge Rodríguez before the Maduro raid has not been previously reported. In October, the Miami Herald reported on abortive negotiations via Qatar, in which Delcy offered to act as a transitional government chief if Maduro stepped down.Reutersreportedon Sunday that Diosdado Cabello, the powerful Venezuela interior minister, who controls police and security forces, had also been in discussions with the US at a point months before the Maduro operation.View image in fullscreenDiosdado Cabello at a ceremony honoring Venezuelan and Cuban personnel who died during the US operation, in Caracas on 8 January 2026.Photograph: Leonardo Fernández Viloria/ReutersAll the sources say there was a fine distinction to the agreement by Delcy Rodríguez: while the Rodríguez family promised to assist the US once Maduro was gone, they did not agree to actively help the US to topple him. The sources insist this was not a coup engineered against Maduro by the Rodríguez siblings.Hours after the raid, Trump appeared to confirm the talks. He told the New York Post that Delcy Rodríguez was onboard. “We’ve spoken to her numerous times, and she understands, she understands.”The Venezuelan government did not respond to emailed questions concerning this story. The White House did not respond to detailed questions.There were many official talks between Trump officials and the Maduro-led Venezuelan government happening on top of the backchannel conversations.Maduro himself met with Ric Grenell, a top Trump aide, just 10 days after Trump’s inauguration, to discuss US prisoners, who were quickly released.View image in fullscreenLaw enforcement officials escort Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, out of a helicopter in New York on 5 January 2026.Photograph: Adam Gray/ReutersKey Trump aides continued official talks with Delcy and Jorge Rodríguez quite often, to coordinate, for example, the biweekly flights of Venezuelans deported from the US, according to two sources familiar with the talks. There was a barrage of issues that had to be solved: where the deportation flights would land, the status of Venezuelans imprisoned in El Salvador and political prisoners that could be released.Meanwhile, Delcy Rodríguez retained very close personal ties with Qatar, where members of the ruling family considered her a friend, according to sources familiar with their relationship. Qatar, a key ally of the US, donated a $400m luxury jet for Trump’s use in an unprecedented gift from a foreign country to a US president. It used the good will it had in Trump’s White House to open more doors for Rodríguez in secret negotiations, two of the sources said.As the Miami Herald reported in October, Rodríguez tried to propose a transition government, led by her, that would rule Venezuela if Maduro agreed to a prearranged retirement in a presumed safe haven. The plan fell through, and Rodríguez fiercely denounced the story, but key Americans began tothinkshe was far from a two-dimensional dogmatic leader.Those who know her describe a figure with disarming quirks that help her form bonds easily. She drinks champagne and has a private table tennis coach and a tendency to challenge foreign dignitaries to games.By October, sources say, even the Americans who were most aggressive against Maduro were open to working with her.‘A more convenient dictatorship’: fear and uncertainty in Venezuela after fall of MaduroRead moreOne factor was her promise to work with US oil companies and her acquaintance with Americans in the oil business. “Delcy is the most committed to working with US oil,” an ally of hers said.The sources saidMauricio Claver-Carone, a former Trump special envoy for Latin America who still had the ear of Marco Rubio despite being out of government, was one key backer.Claver-Carone declined to comment.View image in fullscreenDelcy Rodríguez in Caracas on 15 January 2026.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockThe main goal for the US was stability once Maduro was out, given the predictions of civil war and chaos. Another of the sources said “the biggest thing was trying to avoid a failed state”.It wasn’t until late fall that Delcy Rodríguez and her brother actually engaged in discussions with the US behind Maduro’s back.Maduro spoke to Trump on the phone in November, and by the next week it was clear Maduro would not leave.For Delcy Rodríguez, it was a delicate dance. At the same time they made the offer, the sources say she did not agree to actively betray Maduro. “She feared him,” said one official familiar with the events.When the US attack helicopters flew into Caracas in early January, Delcy Rodríguez was nowhere to be found. Rumors spread that she had fled to Moscow, buttwo sources say she was on Margarita Island, a Venezuelan vacation spot.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaTrump administrationDelcy RodríguezNicolás MaduroUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Whether you live in a coastal town or a rural village, you deserve the same shot at survival and quality of life as everyone else.”Streeting hopes more staff will allow patients to access cancer care more quickly, improve early diagnosis and increase survival rates, which are low compared with similar countries.Hospitals in poorer areas, many of which are located rurally or on the coast, often have fewer doctors – especially senior specialists – than those in cities and big teaching hospitals, which leaves patients waiting longer to be seen. Many have fewer cancer consultants than hospitals elsewhere.Attracting enough doctors to work in such places is often a challenge, which has led to a disproportionate number of medical roles being filled by medics from overseas.GP surgeries in poorer areas are also affected by “under-doctoring”, further reducing access to care in places with the highest level of health need.The initiative will result in more doctors in the early stages of their careers being offered specialist training posts in such hospitals, rather than increased numbers of consultants working there.However, it is unclear how many extra training places in cancer medicine it will produce. That is still subject to discussion between the Department ofHealthand Social Care and NHS England.The scheme is one of a host of measures to improve cancer care in England that will be announced in the government’s new national cancer plan on 4 February, WorldCancerDay.Streeting – himself a cancer survivor – hopes that more cancer doctors working in rural and coastal hospitals will also help to reduce economic inactivity, which is higher in those places.Gemma Peters, the chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: “Right now, cancer care isn’t fair. Too many people’s experiences are being shaped by who they are and where they live.“We know that many people in rural and coastal communities can face worse cancer outcomes, and expanding the cancer workforce in these places is a vital step towards tackling these inequalities.”Michelle Mitchell, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, added: “No one should be at a greater risk of dying of cancer because of where they live, but cancer death rates are around a third higher for people living in the most deprived areas of England compared to the least deprived.“Ensuring everybody across England can access the best diagnostic tests is also crucial. It’s promising to see that the sponge on a string test, funded by Cancer Research UK to spot conditions that could lead to oesophageal cancer, is one of the new innovations the government is looking to roll out more quickly. Beating cancer must mean beating it for everybody, and the national cancer plan for England has a huge opportunity to bring us closer to this goal.”The plan will also set new targets for how quickly cancer patients receive care and treatment, and put more money into new technologies, including AI, to detect signs of the disease earlier.Dr Stephen Harden, the president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said: “Boosting the cancer workforce and embracing the latest technology to help spot cancer earlier are important steps to speed up diagnosis and treatment.”But hospitals needed more senior doctors, not just those still in training, he added. “To ensure patients in underserved areas benefit in the long term, it will be essential that permanent consultant posts are available so cancer doctors can stay and build fulfilling careers locally once training is complete.”Explore more on these topicsNHSCancerHealthEnglandInequalityLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Early versions of AI-powered influence operations have been used in the 2024 elections inTaiwan, India and Indonesia.Grok AI generated about 3m sexualised images in 11 days, study findsRead more“A disruptive threat is emerging: swarms of collaborative, malicious AI agents,” the authors said.“These systems are capable of coordinating autonomously, infiltrating communities and fabricating consensus efficiently. By adaptively mimicking human social dynamics, they threaten democracy.”One leading expert in propaganda technology, Inga Trauthig, said the adoption of such advanced technology is likely to be slowed by politicians’ reluctance to cede campaign control to AIs. Another cause for skepticism is concern that using such illicit techniques would not be worth the risk, given voters are still more influenced by offline material.The experts behind the warning include New York University’s Gary Marcus, a prominent sceptic about the claimed potential of current AI models who calls himself a “generative AI realist”, and Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s first digital minister, who has warned: “Those in the pay of authoritarian forces are undermining electoral processes, weaponizing AI and employing our societal strengths against us.”Others include David Garcia, professor for social and behavioural data science at the University of Konstanz, Sander van der Linden, a misinformation expert and director of Cambridge University’s social decision-making lab, and Christopher Summerfield, AI researcher and professor of cognitive neuroscience at Oxford University.Together they say political leaders could deploy almost limitless numbers of AIs to masquerade as humans online and precisely infiltrate communities, learn their foibles over time and use increasingly convincing and carefully tailored falsehoods, to change population-wide opinions.The threat is being supercharged by advances in AIs’ ability to pick up on the tone and content of discourse. They are increasingly able to mimic human dynamics, for example, by using appropriate slang and posting irregularly to avoid detection. Progress in the development of “agentic” AI also means the ability to autonomously plan and coordinate action.As well as operating across social media, they may use messaging channels and even write blogs or use email, depending on which channel the AI thinks best helps achieve an aim, said one of the authors, Daniel Thilo Schroeder, a research scientist at the Sintef research institute in Oslo.“It’s just frightening how easy these things are to vibe code and just have small bot armies that can actually navigate online social media platforms and email and use these tools,” said Schroeder, who has been simulating swarms in laboratory conditions.Another of the authors, Jonas Kunst, professor of communication at the BI Norwegian Business School, said: “If these bots start to evolve into a collective and exchange information to solve a problem – in this case a malicious goal, namely analysing a community and finding a weak spot – then coordination will increase their accuracy and efficiency.“That is a really serious threat that we predict is going to materialise.”In Taiwan, where voters are regularly targeted by Chinese propaganda, often unknowingly, AI bots have been increasing engagement with citizens on Threads and Facebook in the last two to three months, said Puma Shen, a Taiwanese Democratic Progressive Party MP and campaigner against Chinese disinformation.During discussions on political topics the AIs tend to provide “tonnes of information that you cannot verify”, creating “information overload”, Shen said. He said AIs might cite fake articles about how America will abandon Taiwan. Another recent trend is for the AI bots to stress to younger Taiwanese people that the China-Taiwan dispute is very complicated “so do not take sides if you have no knowledge”.Scarlett Johansson and Cate Blanchett back campaign accusing AI firms of theftRead more“It’s not telling you that China’s great, but it’s [encouraging them] to be neutral,” Shen told the Guardian. “This is very dangerous, because then you think people like me are radical.”Amid signs the progress of AI technology is not as rapid as Silicon Valley companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have claimed, the Guardian asked independent AI experts to assess the swarm warnings.“In the election-heavy year of 2024 the capabilities were there for AI-driven microtargeting but we didn’t see as much of that as scholars predicted,” said Trauthig, an adviser to the International Panel on the Information Environment. “Most political propagandists I interview are still using older technologies and are not at this cutting edge.”“It isn’t fanciful,” said Michael Wooldridge, professor of the foundations of AI at Oxford University. “I think it is entirely plausible that bad actors will try to mobilise virtual armies of LLM-powered agents to disrupt elections and manipulate public opinion, for example targeting large numbers of individuals on social media and other electronic media. It’s technologically perfectly feasible … the technology has got progressively better and much more accessible.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Disinfo black opsComputingTaiwanSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

However, the measure would only apply to new stoves, most of which already meet the stricter limit. The new limit would cut the annual toxic emissions from wood burning in the UK by only 10% over the next decade, according to the consultation.Clean air campaigners said the proposals ignore the pollution from existing stoves and compared less polluting stoves to low-tar cigarettes.Pollution from burning in homes is one of the UK’s biggest sources of air pollution, contributing 20% of fine particles, about the same as all road transport. The fine particles are the most dangerous air pollutant for human health, the government said. Wood-burning stoves and fires in homes are linked to 2,500 early deaths a year in the UK, according to a recent study, as well as 3,700 cases of diabetes and 1,500 cases of asthma.Wood burners linked to 2,500 deaths a year in the UK, analysis findsRead moreWood burners are used by about 12% of households, but more than90% of these have other sources of heating. Many use the stoves and fires solely for their aesthetic appeal.Emma Hardy, the air quality minister, said: “Dirty air robs people of their health and costs our NHS millions each year to treat lung conditions and asthma. We are determined to clean up our air. By limiting emission levels and introducing new labels as outlined in our consultation, families will be able to make better, healthier choices when heating their homes.”The UK-wide consultation proposes labels for new stoves that clearly state the impact burning solid fuels has on the health of individuals and their families. A suggested warning reads: “Please be aware that this appliance emits air pollution into and around your home which can harm your health.” The label would also rate the energy efficiency of the stove from A to C.Wood sold for burning would also carry a health warning, with a suggested wording reading: “Burning in the home leads to air pollution which has a negative impact on the health of you and your family.” The final proposed measure would increase the fine for fuel suppliers who sell insufficiently dry wood from £300 to £2,000. Damp wood produces more pollution.The proposed limit for smoke emissions from new stoves is 1g per hour, down from the current 5g per hour. About 70% of stoves tested since 2018 already meet the new limit, the consultation said, and the new standard would not come into force for three to five years from the date the new law is passed.The foreword to the consultation said: “We all deserve to live in an environment where our everyday lives are not negatively affected by the quality of the air that we breathe.” Emissions of fine particle pollution from domestic burning rose by 36% from 2009-20, largely due to a rise in emissions from the burning of wood.Larissa Lockwood, director of clean air at Global Action Plan, said: “While measures to tighten pollution standards for wood burning stoves and better inform people of the health risks of these products at the point of sale are a good first step, they don’t go far enough.“A less polluting stove is like a low tar cigarette: it’s slightly better for your health, but still significantly worse than not using them in the first place. We want to see further action from the government to ensure everyone can access cleaner, greener forms of heating and give local authorities the powers they need to curb harmful emissions for the benefit of their local communities.”Research found thatno prosecutions for illegal wood burningwere made in England in the year to August 2025, despite 15,195 complaints. Only 24 fines were issued by local authorities during that period.Jemima Hartshorn from theMums for Lungscampaign group said: “Almost daily, people tell us about being smoked out of their homes and gardens, of non-stop coughing and wheezing during the winter despite their neighbours burning in a legal way across the country.“Non-essential wood burning needs to end,. The consultation outline does not go far enough – it only suggests measures that will reduce wood burning from new stoves but does not address the huge pollution emitted by existing stoves. Hopefully, the final outcome will be more aligned with scientists and health professionals and the needs of the public and children’s health.”Theconsultationcloses on 19 March.Explore more on these topicsAir pollutionHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Twenty animals, including 19 belugas, have died at the park since 2019, according to a tally by the Canadian Press.Marineland, which is closed to visitors and wants to sell off its land, shocked the public last year – afterits China proposal was rejected– saying that it was running out of resources to care for its 30 whales and might euthanize them.A fisheries ministry spokesperson, Ira Khedkar, told AFP in a statement on Thursday that Marineland representatives met with the government on Wednesday.“The minister [Joanne Thompson] was presented with new export permit applications. The minister will review them expeditiously,” Khedkar said.Phil Demers, a former trainer turned whistleblower at the reportedly bankrupt Marineland, told AFP the park wants to sell the belugas to several institutions in the United States.The Canadian Press also reported on Thursday that Marineland wants to sell the animals to a series of US parks.Marineland did not immediately reply to a query about a CP report that the park has prepared a euthanasia plan and intends to kill its whales if its US export proposal is rejected.Thompson has said she rejected Marineland’s 2025 request to sell the whales to the Chimelong Ocean Kingdom theme park in China because thatwould have perpetuated the whales’ exploitation.The ministry did not comment on the specifics of Marineland’s latest proposal.Marineland has said all the beluga deaths at the park have resulted from natural causes, but animal welfare officials from the province of Ontario have been investigating the park for five years.Explore more on these topicsCanadaWhalesAmericasMarine lifeWildlifeCetaceansnewsShareReuse this content"

It moves slower than an escalator. By most accounts, it is a clumsy and near-sightless relic drifting in the twilight waters of theArctic, lazily searching for food scraps.The Greenland shark, an animal one researcher (lovingly) said, “looks like it’s already dead”, is also one of the least understood, biologically enigmatic species on the planet.However, this month, scientists made a groundbreaking discovery: the sharks are not, in fact, blind. Thenewly published findings upend commonly held beliefsand expose the challenges of studying a shark that has long resisted the reaches of science. But the disruptive nature of the research also underscores the challenges scientists face in predicting how a rapidly changing climate might harm or help the elusive fish.“Greenland sharks represent absolute mystery,” says Jena Edwards, a Canadian marine ecologist. “Even the things that we think we know, we’re still a little bit unsure about. Everything about them is a question mark.”View image in fullscreenMarine ecologist Jena Edwards on a fishing vessel used by the research team in Scott Inlet, Nunavut, northern Canada.Photograph: Eric  Ste MarieFor decades, frustratingly little has been known about the shark, a mottled, baguette-shaped creature that reaches 20ft in length. Their sedate pace is undercut by the remains of caribou, polar bear, moose, narwhal and beluga found in their stomachs – and not all the prey is believed to be from scavenging.This type of dating method is challenging to use for ageing animals that are hundreds of years oldNigel Hussey, Greenland shark expert“We’re taking blind shots in the dark. We have so little data that we make a hypothesis based on what we know, but need so much more research to fully understand what’s actually going on with these sharks,” she says.Researchers have long held two key beliefs: they are the oldest living vertebrates and they are functionally blind. Both have long made sense, given that sharks are most commonly found in the cold Arctic waters, where light is minimal and where slow movements are often equated to a slower metabolism.View image in fullscreenGreenland shark expert Nigel Hussey with a bio-logging sensor in Tremblay Sound, Nunavut. He says ‘we absolutely underestimate’ the species.Photograph: Eric Ste MarieBut in early January, researchers from five universities around the world found that the retinas appear structurally pristine and were capable of detecting light and contrast. While most Greenland sharks’ eyes are cloudy and have worm-like parasitic copepods dangling from the cornea, extensive study on the structure, genetic sequencing and molecular function of shark retinas showed they successfully withstood a sustained assault by parasites and harsh Arctic conditions.For Nigel Hussey, one of the world’s leading Greenland shark experts, the results aligned with his own experiences on the ocean floor – and confirmed his belief they are “absolutely incredible animals” that, on nearly every occasion, “we vastly underestimate”.Five years ago in a submersible off the coast of Svalbard, Norway, he observed Greenland sharks diving almost vertically between the surface and the sea floor, displaying a far greater range of movement than previously thought as they fine-tuned their knowledge of the location of hundreds of pounds of fish researchers had left at the bottom.“Studying Greenland sharks is like finding a handful of puzzle pieces, but then realising it’s a thousand-piece puzzle,” says doctoral student Eric Ste Marie, who works with Hussey and was with him on that submersible trip. “We’re trying to kind of come to a complete picture of this animal, using only a small snapshot of their lives.”A Greenland shark swims out of the darkness up to a post to which a meat or fish carcass is tied and begins to eatA baited remote underwater camera captures footage of a Greenland shark feeding in Tremblay Sound, Nunavut.The trip, where the pair also observed that the sharks used their fins similarly to belugas for finely tuned movements, has caused Hussey to question many of the commonly held beliefs about the shark – including the idea they can live aslong as 500 years.Awidely cited study in 2016 used carbon datingto estimate the upper level of Greenland shark longevity. By the researchers’ estimates, some of the sharks in the ocean could have overlapped comfortably with William Shakespeare or Galileo. But Hussey says the specific carbon-dating methodology, commonly used to pinpoint where ancient artefacts fit within history, “puts you in the ballpark” when looking at dates of tens of thousands of years. But he cautions that the method has margins of error for shorter time frames.“This type of dating method is challenging to use for ageing animals that are hundreds of years old. In some ways, it was a surprise the paper was published in Science, one of the top tier ecology journals in the world. The technique requires further validation for use in this context,” he says.View image in fullscreenEric Ste Marie studies a small Greenland shark in Scott Inlet, Nunavut.Photograph: Jena EdwardsEven the name Greenland shark serves as a misnomer. Despite the common belief that they exist only in the deep, the frigid temperatures of high northern latitudes means the creatures often appear in shallow water.Headlines of theshark turning up in Caribbeanwaters doesn’t necessarily mean they are lost – but instead reflect the species are probably global circumnavigators, often existing at depths far below commercial fisheries.“Even if they live only 100 years, how far can they travel in that time? How big does our scale of management need to be?” says Edwards. “Do we need to consider that one animal is likely moving across the whole of the Atlantic Ocean in its lifetime?”The profound and disorienting unknowns surrounding the shark are amplified by the uncertainties of a changing Arctic. The resource-rich region, which hascaptured the interest of global superpowers, iswarming at a rate fasterthan anywhere else on Earth.I think they’re tricky, I think they’re sharp and suspect they’re actually very capable predatorsNigel Hussey“They’re a generalist species that can eat anything. They’ll survive, even if the whole food web shifts and they have to feed on completely different things,” says Hussey. Warming Arctic temperatures will probably just push Greenland sharks to deeper, colder waters than southern latitudes.Instead, Hussey is concerned about how little is known about Greenland shark reproduction. The last pregnant female was documented in 1950 and over 75 years later scientists still have no idea where the sharks reproduce, nor do they know how many pups are in a litter.View image in fullscreenThe research team’s field camp in Tremblay Sound, Nunavut.Photograph: Eric Ste MarieThe sharks also serve as a cautionary tale against hubris and underscore the knowledge gaps that persist.I’m obsessed with deep sea sharks: their bioluminescent spots are just visible in the pitch black environment they live inRead more“We get blinded by the stereotype. I think they’re tricky, I think they’re sharp and suspect they’re actually very capable predators,” says Hussey.He and Ste Marie point to oral history of Inuit hunters that the sharks have been seen making predatory attacks in shallow waters. Hussey says there’s a chance they ambush mammals while they sleep or when they’ve found a breathing hole in the ice.“If all they can do is scavenge, how the hell have they managed to live on this planet for so long? And I think it’s only a matter of time before we learn, once more, just how profoundly we’ve underestimated them.”Explore more on these topicsSharksSeascape: the state of our oceansEndangered speciesMarine lifeWildlifeArcticfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The report’s authors warn that similar heat events could be expected every second year if the world warms 2.6C above the preindustrial average, which is predicted to be reached by the end of the century based on current carbon emissions.How do we know that the climate crisis is to blame for extreme weather?Read moreWWA co-founder Friederike Otto, a professor of climate science at Imperial College London, said: “As extreme heat is one of the deadliest extreme weather events that is changing very fast with global warming … it is important to highlight these rapid changes, even if the results are not surprising at all.”WWA, an international collaboration of scientists, uses weather observations and climate models to analyse the role human-caused global heating plays in extreme weather events.Otto noted that while the techniques the group uses are well established, “as we make the results available in the days and weeks after the event, the [heatwave] study itself is not peer reviewed yet”.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsClimate crisisLa NiñanewsShareReuse this content"

He said restaurants were closing every day as a result of rising business rates, which came on top of higher energy, staffing and ingredient costs and little growth in consumer spending.“I’ve never seen it so bad,” Ramsay told the Standardnews site. “When I look ahead to April, when the budget measures come in, I think those of us in hospitality are lambs to the slaughter.”He said the fact that businesses were still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, during which many restaurants were forced to close for months as part of government-ordered lockdowns, meant the situation was even worse than after the 2008 financial crisis.“We’re being suffocated,” said the restaurateur, whose business made anoperating loss despite increasing sales in 2024, the latest accounts available. “We need more oxygen – a reduction in rates of 20% or 25%.”Ramsay’s comments came after the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said this month she was considering measures to support pubs, after criticisms of changes in the budget to business rates, which replaced generous Covid support measures with new lower discounts, just as many businesses faced increases linked to revaluations of their properties.However, Reeves told the World Economic Forum in Davos this week that her planned support packagewould not cover the wider hospitality sector.While many big retailers have seen bills remain steady or fall, the trade body UKHospitality has forecast that increased rates bills will lead to the closure of an estimated 963 restaurants, 574 hotels and 540 pubs this year, if the government does not introduce hospitality-wide assistance.The government has put in place several billions of pounds of support to help those facing big bill rises this year, but Ramsay said the changes in rates should be introduced more slowly. “The trouble is that the rises are coming in too quickly, at one of the worst possible moments,” he said.He said the government needed to consult industry more about its plans and think ahead to what its actions would lead to.Increases in the cost of living for many households, which have pulled back on treats such as meals out and trips to the pub as they spend more on household bills and food, mean it is difficult to pass on higher costs to customers.“Customers are at their breaking point too,” Ramsay said.He said the difficult business conditions were also dissuading entrepreneurial chefs from opening new restaurants.“We’re all going to miss out on a generation of independent chefs and independent restaurants. Everyone loses. The government’s plans simply will not work, I promise you now,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGordon RamsayFood & drink industryTax and spendingBudget 2025BudgetnewsShareReuse this content"

I understand some of the perceptions people may have or may choose to have, but we have to be clear-eyed about our role, which is about protecting communities … It is an assessment of safety and we are intervening to ensure safety.”Harman added the biggest risk, according to the Met’s assessment, was the reaction of people in Tower Hamlets, which is one of a multiplicity of factors police commanders have taken into account in their decision ordering Ukip away from the area. “Largely it is the reaction of the local community, or members of that local community [that] may lead to disorder,” he said.“It may be the conduct of those attending the protest. It is about the nature of the protest. It is about the location of the protest. It is about what communities have told us about their fears. It is about what we have seen take place previously, and what we understand to be the risk of Ukip going to Tower Hamlets to conduct the protest they wish to conduct.”View image in fullscreenMembers of Bangladeshi community mobilise to oppose a far-right march in Whitechapel, London, last year.Photograph: Guy Smallman/Getty ImagesLast week Craig Guildfordstepped down as West Midland police’s chief constableafter adamning reportinto his banning of Israeli football fans, amid claims the force had given into extremist threats if Maccabi fans had travelled to Birmingham. Privately senior officers involved in the West Midlands force’s decision believed the ban had stopped serious violence and disorder, but othersbelieve the basis was flawed.Harman said the Ukip march was different as it would be allowed if an alternative route could be found: “I won’t draw a comparison with Maccabi, but it’s not a ban, because on 31 January, Ukip may very well be able to undertake their protest, but to do so at a location which we do not feel, we do not assess, we do not believe, to pose a risk of serious disorder and serious violence.”Anyone ignoring the order and believed to be part of the Ukip protest would be arrested, Harman said, adding police had made the same decision ordering Ukip away from a planned parade through Tower Hamlets in October.Harman, who leads for the Met on public order and protests, said they had intensified in complexity and frequency across a number of causes, from pro-Palestinian marches to demonstrations against the regime in Iran. The Met in two years has spent £76m policing 884 protests, Harman said.In 2011, the then home secretary, Theresa May, banned an English Defence League march planned to go through Tower Hamlets over fears of violence.Explore more on these topicsLondonUK Independence party (Ukip)RaceProtestMetropolitan policePolicenewsShareReuse this content"

I was concerned that Noah had been a bit down and more emotional than usual,” she said.Before he left home she had found him crying in his room. “I asked him why he was crying. He turned to me and said he was laughing,” Donohoe said.The period between Noah’s disappearance and his body being found was a “living nightmare”, she said. She sat with her head bowed, visibly upset, as her emergency call from the day Noah went missing was played in court.She paid tribute to her son’s “lust for life and learning” and said they had a “beautiful, magical bond”.Mr Justice Rooney told the jury of two women and nine men to keep an open mind about what happened, to deliver findings based on evidence in court and to ignore publicity around a case that has spawned conspiracy theories. Last week he warned the public to avoid any social media activity that could prejudice the inquest, which is expected to continue until late March.Noah’s disappearance in the summer of 2020 brought hundreds of volunteers on to the streets to search for him. He had left his southBelfasthome on his bicycle at 5.41pm on 21 June 2020, reportedly to meet friends. He had a khaki rucksack that contained a Lenovo laptop and a copy of the book 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson.When he did not return, his mother reported him missing at 9.44pm. It was later established he had cycled through the city centre and fallen off his bicycle on the Shore Road. CCTV footage showed Noah cycling into a Protestant enclave in north Belfast, approximately 3 miles from his home, where it is believed he had not previously ventured. Even more inexplicably, during the journey he discarded his rucksack, telephone and clothing and cycled naked.Police found the body in a secluded storm drain in the Northwood Road area. Peter Coll KC, counsel for the coroner, told the jury it would hear evidence that the bars on the storm drain were far enough apart for Noah to pass through. A postmortem examination found that his death was due to drowning and police said there appeared to be no foul play.Noah’s mother campaigned for an inquest, saying the actions ascribed to her son – whom St Malachy’s college described as an industrious pupil who played cello – were completely out of character.Last October, in a public appeal for information, the coroner released previously unseen CCTV footage of Noah in the early hours of the day he disappeared. It showed him leaving his Fitzroy Avenue home at about 3.34am wearing flip-flops, a T-shirt and shorts and carrying headphones. The footage showed him returning at 4.08am barefoot and without headphones.The coroner appealed for information about where Noah went that morning, whether he met anyone, what happened to his flip-flops and headphones and whether he had made similar early-morning excursions.In her witness statement, Noah’s mother said she had no explanation for his behaviour on the day he went missing. “I’m holding out hope that this inquest is able to provide me with answers,” she said.Explore more on these topicsBelfastNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

A protest in Preston on Saturday had attracted hundreds of people.Favordale in Colne, Grove House in Adlington, Milbanke in Kirkham, Thornton House in Thornton-Cleveleys and Woodlands in Clayton-le-Moors had all been slated for closure. In November, families of residents at Woodlandstold the Guardianthey had been left astonished at the council’s decision to close a home that did so much for their loved ones. The son of one resident called the planned closure “cruel, especially from a party that claims to have respect for people who have contributed to society”.Mark Clifford, the leader of council’s Labour group and the shadow cabinet member for adult social care, praised the work of those who fought against the council’s plans, saying that the decision was “embarrassing” for Reform but a win for the residents and their families.“It’s a huge win because the public have voiced their thoughts and it has been a very, very embarrassing U-turn for Reform. We welcome this, but we certainly don’t welcome the way they’ve been acting and treating the public and residents of these facilities all throughout this consultation.”Clifford also said Reform was trying to rewrite history by stating that they never intended to actually close the homes, a claim that Reform councillor Graham Dalton, the cabinet member for adult social care, had reiterated on BBC Radio Lancashire.“There seems to have been a well-spun narrative that these care homes were supposed to be closing,” Dalton said on Tuesday. “You can look back through cabinet meetings, you can look back through our social media; there has been no talk of closing homes. There’s only ever been talk of a review.”The council published plans to close the homes in the autumn, complete with a timetable for closures, before beginning the consultation process.Cat Smith, the Labour MP Lancaster and Wyre, raised questions about where the new investment for the care homes would come from and what form it would take, describing the announcement as “chaotic”. She told Beyond Radio: “Reform need to provide some clarity as soon as possible on their announcement,” and said “this level of confusion and frustration for vulnerable older adults, their families, and staff is unacceptable”.Despite the announcement from councillors, Reform said the decision had not yet officially been made and that the consultation to decide the fate of the care homes, as well as five day care centres in the area, would not conclude until March.A council spokesperson said: “The council has not made any decision at this stage. Now that the consultation has closed, officers are analysing all the feedback and preparing a full report for cabinet in spring, where councillors will review the findings before making any formal decisions.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKLancashireLocal governmentSocial carenewsShareReuse this content"

The judge calculated she worked an average of more than 17 hours a day, she was expected to care for the children and provide other domestic services and was not given rest days, lunch breaks or days off.According to the judgment she was fed “inadequately” and was subject to “verbal abuse and threats”. The family withheld her passport, she was denied internet access in the flat and not given a UK sim card for the first few months. The woman had no family, friends or support network in the UK.While she received some money during her time with the family, it was significantly below the minimum wage at the time – just £400 for the 12 weeks she was with the family in London before she escaped.In November 2014, the Home Office recognised that she was a victim of human trafficking. The UAE government did not attend court for the case. In December 2015 she was granted leave to remain in the UK.A total of £262,292.76 was awarded to her in damages for false imprisonment, injury to feelings and personal injury due to a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of her experience with the family. The court was told that due to her experience with the family, she could not trust any employer and was in constant fear of being subjected to the same treatment she received from the Aljaberi family if she was re-employed.The judge said that part of the damages he was awarding were “exemplary” damages, which are punitive rather than compensatory. He said: “I accept that such an award is appropriate in a case in which Mr Aljaberi acted with a cynical disregard for the claimant’s rights and exploited the claimant for his own financial advantage.”He said that he had awarded the damages due to the “wrongfulness of Mr Aljaberi’s conduct”. He added that withholding of her wages was “part of the servitude which was inflicted on her”.Her solicitor, Zubier Yazdani of Deighton Pierce Glynn, said: “This is a welcome decision. It goes some way to providing accountability for the harm that my client suffered. Domestic workers in diplomatic households have been vulnerable to abuse for too long. Sending states should share responsibility where their diplomats exploit domestic workers.”The UAE embassy was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsHuman traffickingUnited Arab EmiratesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Yang has built a small business empire including shops, restaurants and a concession for a hydroelectric project.Men charged with contract killing of Indigenous leader to go on trial in PeruRead moreProsecutors say another Chinese citizen, Ji Wu Xiaodong, who was present at the first meeting in the restaurant, is accused of belonging to an illegal timber-trafficking network known as Los Hostiles de la Amazonia and had been placed under house arrest for two years.Official records show Ji Wu, an accredited Spanish translator who had worked with Lima’s Chinese embassy, made several visits to the presidential palace in the last few months, accompanied by Yang.In a national television interview on Tuesday, Jerí said Ji Wu had served the food at the restaurant but they did not talk because he spoke little Spanish.The interim president had previously issued a public apology after the meeting at the Chinese restaurant emerged, which appeared to have been shakily filmed on a smartphone. He said the visit was to coordinate the anniversary celebration of the day of Peruvian-Chinese friendship. He apologised for “giving rise to suspicions and doubts about my behaviour” by the way he was dressed.But hours after Jerí’s apology, another video emerged showing the second meeting with Yang, at his store in Chinatown, which had been forced to close by Lima’s municipal government for selling unauthorised products.The scandal is likely to raise eyebrows in Washington, where the Trump administration has raged at growing Chinese investment in Latin America.The Chinese firm Cosco Shipping Ports built a fully automated deepwater port in Chancay, 50 miles (80km) north of Lima, which has been operating since November 2024 and offers an express trade route to China.This month, in an apparent move to challenge China’s dominance, the US state department approved thepotential sale to Peru of $1.5bn in equipment and servicesto help the country relocate its main naval base in Lima’s port of Callao, to allow the seaport’s expansion.In a statement, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said the “proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy objectives of the United States by helping to improve the security of an important partner that promotes political stability, peace and economic progress in South America”.Explore more on these topicsPeruChinaAsia PacificAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, adriver was killedand 37 people injured when a train was derailed by the collapse of a retaining wall near Gelida in Catalonia.A number of people were also lightly injured on Thursday when a commuter train in the south-eastern region of Murcia crashed into a crane. Authorities said the incident was caused by “the intrusion … of a crane not belonging to the railway operation”, and the train was not derailed or overturned.The accidents in Adamuz and Gelida led the Spanish railway drivers’ union Semaf to announce industrial action. They have also prompted a stoppage by drivers that has shut down Catalonia’s regional rail services, affecting about 400,000 travellers.The union said three days of strikes would be held from 9 to 11 February, saying the action was “the only legal avenue left for workers to demand the restoration of safety standards on the railway system and, consequently, guarantee the safety of both railway professionals and passengers”.Semaf called for the relevant authorities to ensure people’s safety by addressing the “numerous reports” on poor track conditions it said had gone “unanswered and inactive for months, or even years”.It added: “The serious accidents in Adamuz and Gelida, both of which resulted in people losing their lives, represent a turning point in demanding that all necessary actions be taken to guarantee the safety of railway operations.”Spain’s transport minister, Óscar Puente, said he understood drivers’ concerns but hoped the strikes could be averted, and he said the stoppage in Catalonia needed to end. He has stressed that the two accidents were “completely unrelated”. The Gelida incident is thought to have been caused by heavy rainfall.“This is a very difficult week,” hetold Catalunya Ràdioon Thursday morning. “We need to remain calm and get this where it needs to be. Two terrible incidents have occurred in a very short space of time, and I believe that is significantly impacting the morale of the train drivers. I hope the situation will be resolved soon.”View image in fullscreenRemoval work continues on Thursday at the scene of the crash near Adamuz.Photograph: Susana Vera/ReutersInvestigators are continuing to examine the crash site in Adamuz and the wreckage of the two trains. The accident happened at 7.40pm on Sunday when a high-speed train travelling from Málaga to Madrid derailed, crossing on to another track where it hit an oncoming train travelling from Madrid to Huelva.Media reports suggest investigators are focusing on a 30cm (12in) crack in the track at the accident site.“There’s an initial point where the derailment is believed to have occurred,” Puente told the radio network Cadena Ser on Monday night. “Now we have to determine if it’s the cause or the consequence. It’s not a trivial matter, and it won’t be quick or easy. We’ll have to send the track to the lab; we have to determine what happened. At this point, nothing can be ruled out.”Puente saidmarks had been foundon the wheels of the first five carriages of the high-speed train, and on the wheels of other trains that had travelled along the same stretch of track before the derailment.“The question now is how those marks appeared,” the minister told the TV channel Telecinco. “Was there something on the tracks, or was the track itself beginning to break down? At this point, it’s not possible to draw any conclusions about what caused those marks.”Spain’s efforts to mourn the dead have been marred by familiar political squabbles. A spokesperson for the far-right Vox party said the Adamuz tragedy was proof of the decline of the country’s once-great rail services.“All Spaniards can see with their own eyes that it’s not safe to travel and that the damage is getting worse by the day,” Pepa Millán said, adding: “Spaniards are scared to get on a train.”Vox’s leader, Santiago Abascal, has attempted to link the Adamuz accident to theseries of corruption allegationsthat have enveloped the socialist-led government. “Corruption destroys confidence in our institutions,” he said. “And corruption kills.”The conservative People’s party (PP) called for Puente, who has made numerous media appearances over the past few days, to provide “absolute transparency”.“The minister has a knack for talking,” said the PP infrastructure spokesperson, Juan Bravo. “But it’s time for him to offer explanations and not spend two hours saying nothing.”The government’s spokesperson, Elma Saiz, said Abascal’s comments were abhorrent. “Given the two tragic nights we’ve just endured, with dozens of injured still hospitalised and not all the bodies recovered, Abascal’s attitude is despicable,” she said. “Using tragedy and fear to generate chaos and distrust is an anti-democratic and inhumane act.”Explore more on these topicsSpainTrain crashesRail transportEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It suggests the impact of the technology may have been broader than previously thought. Public figures identified in sexualised images it analysed include Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Ice Spice, Nicki Minaj, Christina Hendricks, Millie Bobby Brown, the Swedish deputy prime minister Ebba Busch, and the former US vice-president Kamala Harris.The feature wasrestricted to paid userson 9 January and further restrictions followed after the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, called the situation “disgusting” and “shameful”. Other countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia, announced blocks on the AI tool.CCDH estimated that over the 11-day period, Grok was helping create sexualised images of children every 41 seconds. These included a selfie uploaded by a schoolgirl undressed by Grok, turning a “before school selfie” into an image of her in a bikini.“What we found was clear and disturbing: in that period Grok became an industrial-scale machine for the production of sexual abuse material,” said Imran Ahmed, CCDH’s chief executive. “Stripping a woman without their permission is sexual abuse. Throughout that period Elon was hyping the product even when it was clear to the world it was being used in this way. What Elon was ginning up was controversy, eyeballs, engagement and users. It was deeply disturbing.”He added: “This has become a standard playbook for Silicon Valley, and in particular for social media and AI platforms. The incentives are all misaligned. They profit from this outrage. It’s not about Musk personally. This is about a system [with] perverse incentives and no minimum safeguards prescribed in law. And until regulators and lawmakers do their jobs and create a minimum expectation of safety, this will continue to happen.”X announced it hadstopped its Grok featurefrom editing pictures of real people to show them in revealing clothes, including for premium subscribers, on 14 January.X referred to its statement from last week, whichsaid: “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.“We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including child sexual abuse material and non-consensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate ourXrules.

Studios in Halifax, Canada and Stockholm are being closed, with restructuring to follow in other countries, it said.What’s behind the phenomenon of ‘gamer brain’Read moreAfter the announcement, Ubisoft’s shares fell by a third to their lowest level since 2011 on Thursday, valuing the company at €590m (£514m) compared with a peak of more than €10bn in the previous decade. The Paris-based company said it planned to split its operations into five creative divisions organised by genre, part of a broader attempt to sharpen focus and rein in costs after years of disappointing releases and weak results.The company said the restructuring was driven by the competitive market for AAA games, the term for big-budget, high-profile titles such as Grand Theft Auto.“The triple-A industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands,” said Ubisoft’s founder and chief executive, Yves Guillemot.However, Guillemot added that successful triple-A games have “more financial potential than ever”.Ubisoft also blamed an “increasingly competitive market” for shooters, a key genre for the industry.Laurent Michaud, a gaming industry economist, said action adventure titles such as Prince of Persia were out of step with a market dominated currently by shooters like Fortnite and Call of Duty, cooperative adventure titles such as Peak and sports titles and multiplayer games such as those available on the Roblox platform.‘I wanted that Raiders of the Lost Ark excitement – you could die any minute’: how we made hit video game Prince of PersiaRead more“The expectations of gamers are quite different to where they were 10 years ago. That’s why it’s difficult to keep in touch with an audience that has changed so much over the years.”He added: “Ubisoft is still one of the most popular content providers in the video games industry. It has developed one of the best IP slates in the industry but even if the games are really good, it is not enough. It has to meet people’s expectations and tastes.”The latest overhaul follows several difficult years marked by game delays, cancellations and weak execution, which have eroded investor confidence and strained the group’s finances. In November 2025, Ubisoft postponed the publication of its half-year results at the last minute, triggering a week-long suspension of trading in its shares and bonds. The company later said an accounting change had revealed a breach of the terms for its debt.Explore more on these topicsGamesUbisoftAssassin's CreedTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

The campaign includes a statement accusing tech firms of using American creators’ work to “build AI platforms without authorisation or regard for copyright law”.It adds: “Artists, writers, and creators of all kinds are banding together with a simple message: Stealing our work is not innovation. It’s not progress. It’s theft – plain and simple.”UK actors vote to refuse to be digitally scanned in pushback against AIRead moreThe statement urges AI companies to pursue licensing deals and partnerships with the creative industries and acknowledges firms that have taken that route. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, has signed deals with content owners including Disney and the Guardian, while Warner Music Group hasstruck a licensing dealwith AI music generator Suno.However, copyright remains one of the most contentious issues within AI, because the models that power chatbots like ChatGPT or image generators like Grok Imaginerely on vast amounts of data taken from the open webin order to help create their responses. Creative professionals argue that tech firms should seek their permission before using such material – and that they should receive a payment if they give their consent.OpenAI, and other AI firms, have argued that using material available online is “fair use”, a US legal doctrine that allows use of copyright-protected work without the owner’s permission in certain circumstances. As of last year,dozens of lawsuitshad been launched in the US over the AI and copyright issue.Johansson was dragged into the AI debate in 2024 after OpenAI’s voice assistantused her vocal likeness, prompting the actor say she was “shocked, angered and in disbelief” by the move. OpenAI subsequently removed the voice from ChatGPT.Other signatories to the statement include actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan and singer Cyndi Lauper. Last year Gilligan described AI as the “world’s most expensive and energy-intensive plagiarism machine”.The “Stealing Isn’t Innovation” push has been organised by the Human Artistry Campaign, whose backers include the Writers Guild of America, the Recording Industry Association of America and the actors’ trade union SAG-AFTRA, which went on strike in 2023,partly over the use of AI.In the UK, the government has been under fire for proposing that AI firms should be allowed to use copyright-protected work without first seeking artists’ permission, unless they signal that they wish to “opt out” of the process. The technology secretary, Liz Kendall, said this month that the government was seeking a “reset” on these plans via an official review due to be published in March.​Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Scarlett JohanssonCate BlanchettREMJodi PicoultOpenAInewsShareReuse this content"

Ofgem said the missed deadline was due to an internal error and the company had since changed its systems.“We expect all suppliers to have robust processes in place and to act quickly when issues arise. Failures of this kind are unacceptable, and we will continue to intervene where necessary to ensure customers receive the support they are entitled to,” Lawrence said.“The warm home discount is a vital source of support for vulnerable energy consumers. Delays of this magnitude can cause real harm, particularly for those experiencing fuel poverty who also have medical needs. Suppliers must act swiftly and accurately to deliver these payments on time – where this does not happen, we will intervene and are prepared to take strong action,” he added.OVO will pay a total of £2,765,200 in compensation directly to affected customers. This will include £150 for all impacted customers, and an additional £150 for medically vulnerable customers. It will pay a further £100 for each instance in which a customer was unable to top up their energy meter between 31 March and 31 May 2024 as a result of the delayed WHD payment.A spokesperson for Ovo said: “We’re very sorry that some customers did not receive their warm home discount payments on time. We have worked closely with Ofgem to understand what went wrong and to put measures in place to ensure it does not happen again. We did not meet the high standards of service we set for ourselves, and all affected customers have now been compensated.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryEnergy billsHousehold billsOfgemnewsShareReuse this content"

She is exactly what the show needs right nowStuart HeritageThu 22 Jan 2026 07.28 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 07.30 ESTShareWhenPrue Leithannounced that she was leaving The Great British Bake Off, on the basis that “I’m 86 for goodness sake,” there was really only one figure who could realistically replace her. And so it has come to pass. Believe press rumours and the next Bake Off judge isNigella Lawson.If it’s true, this is the best possible call for a series that – if we’re honest – has lost its way. Bake Off has become slightly long in the tooth over the last half decade or so. This is partly to do with talent churn (over the years we’ve lost Mel and Sue, Mary Berry, Sandi Toksvig, Matt Lucas and now Prue Leith) and partly because the series is struggling to keep its challenges fresh.If it repeats the safe old formula that made it popular in the first place, it risks becoming stale. If it keeps ramping up the difficulty, then it risks alienating the home baker with bewildering levels of conceptual avant-garde science. If it tries doing national weeks again, as it did when it dressed everyone in sombreros and shook maracas during its ill-advisedMexican week in 2022, then its viewership will die of second-hand embarrassment.View image in fullscreenExiting … former GBBO judge Prue Leith alongside Paul Hollywood.Photograph: Channel 4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PAWhatThe Great British Bake Offreally needs now is a combination of talents that is very hard to come by. A new judge needs to have true expertise grounded in decades of experience. They also need to have forensic intelligence and enough full-beam charisma to paper over the cracks in the format.There are some figures who can achieve some of this.TV chef Lorraine Pascalewould be great but, judging by her Instagram, now primarily works in the skincare industry. Chef and author Ravneet Gill has a level of pastry expertise that would rival Paul Hollywood, but doesn’t have the right level of name recognition. There is also the possibility, since the show has been going long enough, that Bake Off could have cast one of its own alumni as a judge, perhaps by hiring the show’s first winnerEdd Kimberor its sixth, Nadiya Hussain. The problem with this, however, is that they aren’t Nigella Lawson.View image in fullscreenContender?

Now in her mid-60s, she has become exactly what the series needs right now. She is spectacularly British, and manages to balance the sort of familiarity that will reassure existing viewers with a level of international first-name recognition that might even end up growing the audience.Nigella Lawson: ‘I can be ecstatically happy with just bread and cheese’Read moreThe only time I have seenNigella Lawsonat work in the flesh was during a press day for the short-lived Channel 4 cookery contest series The Taste over a decade ago. And while her co-judges Ludo Lefebvre and Anthony Bourdain were forceful and garrulous respectively, Nigella managed to be both at once. Initially so haughty that even the thought of making eye contact with her terrified the life out of me, she then flicked on the charm so devastatingly that I turned into a puddle. I have photographic evidence, which bears the sweat patches to prove it.This is exactly the combination Bake Off requires. While Paul Hollywood typically gets pegged as the tough judge, the truth is that Mary Berry and Prue Leith both had a steely, imperious core that was just as immovable. They were lovely, of course, but go and pause any old episode and you’ll see flinty looks in their eyes. They both demanded that you impress them. Nigella is the same. She is formidably intelligent with high expectations. Imagine serving her a collapsed soufflé. Imagine the hurt and disappointment in her eyes.In truth, The Great British Bake Off is much closer to its end than its beginning. Like fellow warhorses MasterChef and The Apprentice, it has started to lumber on exhaustedly in recent years, and will soon be destined for the knacker’s yard. But if it’s going to go out, it deserves to go out as strongly as possible. Nigella Lawson is the only woman for the job.Explore more on these topicsThe Great British Bake OffTelevisionFood TVNigella LawsonFoodReality TVPrue LeithfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What are your tips for living life between adversities?Integrity411My mother’s ex-husband was a questionable man and after he picked me up from elementary school he used to take me to a go-go bar where ladies were dancing in their panties. I was a child, so I thought: how nice for them, I hate getting dressed too! They dance all day and then some nice people put money in their panties.The ladies would give me milk or Coca-Cola and give me a dollar, so I wanted to be a go-go dancer when I grew up. At that age I didn’t know there was anything wrong with me going there and I learned not to judge people so quickly. However, when my mother discovered why I was coming home late she kicked into fifth gear. She told the bar not to let me in and instead showed me art, opera, ballet – anything that was free – and changed my palate and perspective. In a way, all that brought me here. Art can get you through things. Cry as hard as you can or even laugh as hard as you can, and hold on to the joy.A Long Walk is my favourite song of yours, not least because I was blessed to have that same experience. Is it something you shared with a special someone or something you yearned for which has not yet come to pass?Soulisasolis33Oh my goodness. I’ve had many long walks with dogs, my mother, my mate, my friends, my child. To just take a walk and talk is one of my favourite things to do, or just to take a walk in silence. I’d recommend it to anybody.View image in fullscreenScott on stage at the 2025 Essence Festival of Culture in New Orleans, Louisiana.Photograph: Erika Goldring/Getty ImagesYour willingness to write and sing about a woman’s deep need for good sex of all flavours – emotional, playful, animal – has made me respect my own desires. Will you be as honest about sex as you age?PtayboviDon’t Play on the new album is akin to A Long Walk: have a good date, followed by a long walk, spark conversation; get to know somebody deeply. It’s a tutorial because it seems to me, via social media, that people are not having quality intimacy. So much of it is performative, so people are missing out on something truly enriching, when you connect with someone you care for. True love gives us the ability to speak up, sleep, maybe even fight off societal ills. I wouldn’t have known that at 18, but my mother has always been very open about sex. Making love and screwing are different things, and I’d like people to know the difference. I can’t imagine not singing about this, because I sing about the things living people do.Your music has been the soundtrack for Black women’s lives since the early 2000s. How does that make you feel and what is the main message you hope to leave for future generations?brownpotatoesI don’t really like boxes. I’m a Black woman, and both portions are as powerful, rooted and exciting, but I’m an artist and believe in telling stories about the human condition for all people. I’m not Nina Simone, though I respect that kind of work. I’d love people to read my lyrics and listen to the body of work from beginning to end. I’m still discovering who Jill Scott is, but like a good meal, it takes time. I also like some mystery. I love Sade, but I don’t know what she had for breakfast, what she wore last night or any of her business. I just love her music. As an artist, you have to have some kind of balance.I loved [Scott’s 2000 debut] Who is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Vol 1. Who is Raheem [in the song Exclusively]?hutchmeupRaheem is an amalgamation of someone cheating, but the incident in the store happened to me. In real life I wasn’t the woman telling the story, I was the woman behind the counter. A woman came in and I smelled my boyfriend on her: that’s how I discovered he was cheating. So in the song she smells him, looks up and goes: “Raheem, right?” You learn what to look out for and who to stay away from.What were the cultural and musical influences that inspiredTo Whom This May Concern?SlowlySurelyC11It was necessary to take a long break. I don’t think you can create art without having some living in between and there were reasons to make some major changes. I cut some people out of my life, some ideas … I was paying attention to social media and people have got angrier. There are a lot of reasons for that and a lot of what’s happening is unsettling, but I wanted to present a private or personal revolution. The song Pressha is about the pressure to look, sing or act a certain way. It’s partly from my own life experience, but also from noticing that people are choosing an aesthetic over character or consistency. That’s dooming our relationships because you’ve married a shell or you’ve had a child with a shell, when the things that really matter are underneath the skin.View image in fullscreenScott and Desmond Dube in The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency.Photograph: Album/AlamyWhy do we not have any more The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency TV programmes?

Then our producer Sydney Pollack passed away, followed by our beloved director Anthony Minghella, so everything shifted. We lost our fearless leaders. Anthony auditioned me six times, then when he finally gave me the role he said he knew it was mine before he met me. I said: “You put me through hell!” But he grew me. I thought they were auditions but really they were classes. He’d say: “OK, now say that line but like you’ve got a cracked rib”, or like “you have an eyelash in your eye”. I was so annoyed! But he was schooling me all the time. I’d love to do more acting but it has to be something I really want to do and I like a director who will guide me, trust me and test me.View image in fullscreenWith DJ AG on Camden High Street, London, on 12 January 2026.Photograph: James Klug/RedfernsWhat made you agree to appearing with [viral street performer]DJ AG in Camdenand when did you first hear about what he’s been doing?DCasherThere’sa [Washington DC rapper] called Noochiewho has people come to his house and perform on his front porch. It’s enjoyed by millions of people. So when I saw DJ AG on social media, I thought it would be fun to do something like that and be with people on the street, for free. It was even more exciting that I’d expected. People surrounded the car and were hitting the windows. I’d forgotten about things like that so it kinda took me off balance, but they were so happy to see me, I was happy to see them and we had a good time.Experimental, sensual and political, D’Angelo radically redrew the boundaries of soul musicRead moreBefore you became a star you took a teacher training course. What kind of teacher do you think you would have become and how strict, or not?!TopCat89I trained as an English teacher and would adapt music into my lessons. There’s music in words, like onomatopoeia. So I’d read to them and try to inspire them. I would have been strict but for their benefit: that tough teacher that jumps on your back but you wanna impress so badly. My favourite teacher was Miss Fran Danish, who introduced me to the poet Nikki Giovanni, who wrote about people like me and the people in my neighbourhood.

The forthcoming movie about the schism betweenMick McCarthyand Roy Keane that led to the latter departing the 2002 World Cup before it started does not attempt to recreate any of the action from the tournament. In fact, it largely takes place in a decrepit hotel. But we do get one exception: Keane, played by Éanna Hardwicke, practising alone in the grounds. At the back of a court, the sullen, spartan athlete stands as a ball is fired up and over the net towards him. He tracks it with his eyes, opens up his right foot, takes the ball on his instep and kills it dead. And with that, his sporting bona fides are confirmed.Saipan is a movie about masculinity, about men and their egos. It’s also about an era in Irish history; the roaring of the Celtic tiger, where questions of national identity came to the fore. What it’s not, really, is a movie about football. Which might be a canny choice, because while the world’s most popular sport only continues to grow its audience, football’s track record on the big screen is, how shall we say, like Manchester United after Sir Alex.“Ninety minutes is what we get in a game, give or take. Films are also 90 minutes. And the experience of the two things are fundamentally different”, says Paul Fraser, Saipan’s screenwriter. “I don’t think I’ve really felt some of the emotions that I feel at a game of football in a film. I get moved by films and profoundly shaken or invested in films, but there’s … the emotion that you get from going to a game which is insane, it’s insane. You know, sometimes I think I’m going to have a heart attack or whatever. And I guess that just doesn’t really transfer over too well.”Fraser is a football enthusiast and believes there is no shortage of tales to be told from its world. He says he has had conversations over developing a biopic of Paul Gascoigne, is fascinated by the biography of Barcelona legend Andrés Iniesta, and briefly considers the Guardian’s suggestion that he should write a farce about Sepp Blatter’s Fifa. But he says the stories stand a much better chance of working when “you focus in on people.” The accounts of Gazza or Keane and McCarthy, he says, are “a different proposition to the sporting narrative: ‘it’s the 90th minute will they score the winner?’ That’s kind of the most boring, generalised kind of narrative that you can do. And that’s why maybe they fail.”Fraser says this was a lesson he had to learn a long time ago. A day-one collaborator of Shane Meadows, their first film together was an abortive attempt at a football movie. TwentyFourSeven was originally a tale based on the pair’s experience in a grassroots football team. “Our best score was like 24-0 against a prison side and we lost,” Fraser says. “There were people getting stoned while the opposition were having a corner. It was just debauched.” But when it came to matching the tensions and passions off the field with the action on it, it just didn’t work. “We felt that football, for some reason, didn’t lend itself too well, visually, to cinema,” Fraser says. “Escape to Victory is a brilliant film, but there’s something about the football sequences in there that feels a bit flat.” So the location was moved from the football pitch to a boxing ring, Bob Hoskins was cast as the passionate outsider coach Alan Darcy, and a new chapter in British cinema began.TwentyFourSeven came out in 1997, five years after the launch of the Premier League and the same year as the big screen adaptation of Nick Hornby’s Fever Pitch. The years since, according to Stephen Glynn a lecturer in film at De Montfort University and author of The British Football Film, have been a boom time for football movies.View image in fullscreenThe soccerati … Ruth Gemmell and Colin Firth in Fever Pitch.Photograph: Cinetext/Channel Four Fi/Allstar“There have been [many] more football films of late,” Glynn says, citing as a possible cause the same gentrifying trends that swept through football itself (captured in the coinage “the prawn sandwich brigade” devised by one Roy Keane). “Certainly before the second world war, professional football was really not seen by studio executives as appropriate for a cultural product. Postwar, you have football comedies that are largely working-class northern tales, Arthur Askey is in one for example. When you reach the 60s you start to get the pop star footballers like George Best and so on, but really it’s more in the last 30 years since people like Nick Hornby kickstarted a more middle-class interest in football that the interest in making movies has grown too. What did he call them? ‘The soccerati’, I think.”Despite that expanding interest, the tracklist of 21st-century football films is largely one clanger after another. From Mike Bassett: England Manager (2001), to the Goal! trilogy (part 3 was released straight to video in 2009) to the 2014 non-farcical history of Fifa, United Passions (funded by Fifa, with Tim Roth playing Blatter), the list is gormless. Only Bend It Like Beckham from that era could be described as memorable entertainment and this was a story whose world was set at a counterpoint to the men’s professional game. At the same time, however, there was the arrival of compelling football documentaries, from Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait, to Asif Kapadia’s Diego Maradona (or, alternatively, Maradona by Kusturica). These movies worked in the cinema, capturing the personalities of their protagonists effectively, but more importantly the action too.“Most footballers can’t act. You know, hello, David Beckham in Goal! So any film with a claim to realism sort of falls down when it tries to do the match action,” says Glynn. “Fans know it’s fake because we expect full framing from football. A player I always really admired was [Arsenal and France striker] Thierry Henry and in part it was because of this notion that if ever you stopped the frame, he looked poised. He looked elegant. And I know that the exact same point has been made about, say, Fred Astaire. You watch his dance numbers, there’s minimum editing, what you see is what you get. You know you are watching a consummate artist. And football films struggle with anything like that.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s a made up story’ … Steve Coogan is Mick McCarthy alongside Éanna Hardwicke’s Roy Keane.Photograph: Aidan Monaghan/PAThese movies, especially those set in the modern day, could be stuck in a bind. On the one hand unable to accurately replicate the on-field drama, on the other, attempts at telling stories off the pitch often come up against the expectations of supporters (they are, after all, a fandom). Saipan has met with favourable reviews inIreland, but also been the subject of pushback from pundits and fans over a perceived looseness with the facts, particularly over the levels of drinking that pervaded the Irish camp in 2002. One scathing piece in the Irish Times by former international Kevin Kilbane begins: “Never let the truth get in the way of a good story.”In explaining the process behind crafting Saipan, Fraser repeats precisely the same phrase with a very different emphasis. “I didn’t speak to any player or any actual person who was there, so it’s a story. It’s a made-up story,” he says. “What did Mark Twain say? Don’t let truth get in the way of a good story. If I was doing a project where I was talking to them and working with them, then that creates a different story and a different process. I think one of the players said something like five stars for the film, but no stars for the accuracy. And I think that would have been something that would start to bog me down. I might have got a few elements of truth from speaking to them, but I think it was certainly better not to engage.”Fraser says that the intention was to write a football film that would speak to audiences that didn’t follow the sport, emphasising instead the humanity that lay underneath these two feuding athletes. “When the producers brought me the idea, I think they wanted someone who was slightly detached, because this has been described as being the most important unimportant event in Irish history. It’s hard not to have an opinion if you’re in any way engaged with football over there. But, for me, I just remember that moment when [Keane] was walking the dog in the country lane after coming home and that was my sort of in. When I started to look and talk about him, he’s from my world, Roy more than Mick but Mick as well. They’re both from a working-class background but they’re living their lives on a global stage and under a global spotlight. That I found really interesting.”Explore more on these topicsFilmRoy KeaneMick McCarthyIrelandWorld Cup 2002featuresShareReuse this content"

It was critically panned, as any show that contains the lines: “He owns, like, all of cosmetics”, “You’re the best lawyers in town – maybe the country!” and a fruit basket “lightly brushed with salmonella and faecal matter”, while somehow managing to bypass humour, camp and brio, deserves to be. It got an unprecedented zero rating on Rotten Tomatoes, a no-stars review here on the grounds that it was so-bad-it-was-bad, and has duly been commissioned for a second series.By that measure, Murphy’s new show is a triumph. The Beauty has a plot, structure, characters that often act, react and speak as real human beings might, a sense of what it’s doing and where it’s going and – whisper it – even a touch of commentary on the state of society today. It’s almost like old American anthology days, when Murphy threw the likes of The People v OJ Simpson, Feud and The Assassination of Gianni Versace at us one after the other; leasing new lives to Sarah Paulson, Jessica Lange and assorted other glorious figures, and having us believe the good times would roll for ever.The new, 11-part series belongs firmly to the genre of body horror, so be prepared for plenty of gore and more than a few “yikes!” as we go along. It is based on the comic book of the same name, written by Jeremy Haun and Jason A Hurley, and follows two FBI agents as they investigate the spread of a sexually transmitted disease that makes infected parties spectacularly beautiful before it makes them spectacularly dead. Yes! It’s a satire on unrealistic beauty standards. And Ozempic culture! And much else besides, but we open with Bella Hadid breaking necks at a catwalk show, punching paparazzi unconscious and smashing up restaurants in search of water to quench her apparently burning thirst, so let’s start there.She is the first of what becomes a veritable epidemic of exploding supermodels across the world (“Catwalk Carnage!” scream newspaper headlines, as well they might), with coltish brunettes going rogue before either bursting bloodily all over the streets or turning into literally smoking hot bodies who have burned from the inside out, leaving only charred ribcages in expensively dressed beds behind.View image in fullscreenCatwalk carnage … Bella Hadid as Ruby in The Beauty on Disney+.Photograph: FX. All Rights Reserved.Investigating this mayhem are detectives Jordan Bennett (Rebecca Hall) and Cooper Madsen (Evan Peters), who are also lovers and pretending not to be falling in love with each other. Jordan has recently had breast implants, as a belated response to school bullies who dubbed her “The Itty-Bitty Titty Committee”, to show us that even tough FBI agents with guns and badges are not immune to the insidious effects of tyrannical western beauty standards.More social commentary arrives in the form of Jeremy (soon to be played by Jeremy Pope), whom we first meet as an isolated masturbator typing one-handed in what looks to be his mother’s – or late mother’s – basement in New Jersey. After a camgirl gets a better offer and disappears from view, he seeks alternative solace. “I’m lost,” he tells a doctor. “I want a purpose. Do you think I should do standup?” (This is when, as a viewer, you truly begin to relax and believe that Murphy has found his form again.) But the doctor is a plastic surgeon and has other ideas. “You are an incel, Jeremy. I can make you a Chad.”And lo, it comes to pass. Thus we and Jeremy learn of the existence of the virus that can make America aesthetically great again. It has been invented – and here comes even more social commentary dressed snazzily up as a good time – by a tech billionaire, Byron Forst (Ashton Kutcher), also known as the Corporation, now aided by a man called the Assassin (Anthony Ramos) to try to keep control of the chaos that is being unleashed. Who knew that a beauty virus spread by sexual contact would be so hard to manage?All this and Isabella Rossellini, too! And in the most incredible wardrobe. Don’t duck out until you’ve see her opening scene, at least. Her character’s name is Franny Forst, which makes me very much suspect she is related to Byron, and acting between Rossellini and Kutcher is a notion of such deliciousness that I could pass out from delight at the mere idea.In short, The Beauty is a return to bingeable Murphy goodness (and a harking back, subject-wise, to arguably some of his best work, Nip/Tuck). It hovers between a three and four star review for me but I’m rounding up out of sheer relief.The Beauty is on Disney+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionRyan MurphyreviewsShareReuse this content"

A final album and tour by the thrash metal pioneers was announced last August, with an AI-assisted video and a written statement that offered some classic grandstanding on the part of frontman and sole original member Dave Mustaine. Never a man to hide his light under a bushel, he equated Megadeth’s decision to quit with a global catastrophe (“some say this is the end of times”) and suggested that the US band “changed the world”.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Megadeth.Photograph: Publicity imageTheir decision to quit makes sense, given the state of Mustaine’s health. Having conquered throat cancer and radial neuropathy, he’s now suffering from arthritis and something called Dupuytren’s contracture – a thickening of tissue under the skin that causes the fingers to bend, commonly known as the suitably metal-sounding Viking disease – both of which impede his ability to play guitar. The call to end the band was made during the recording of their self-titled 17th studio album. But then three months later Mustaine announced that the farewell dates announced were only the beginning. The tour is scheduled to last “easily … three to five years”. So there seems every chance that Megadeth will still be bidding the world adieu in the next decade.Still, there is a definite sense of finality to this new music. Rather than a full-blooded return to the genre their early albums helped birth, it effectively offers listeners a career-summarising redux. Some tracks certainly underline their position as thrash metal progenitors, most notably the flatly superb opener Tipping Point, as well as Made to Kill and Let There Be Shred. The latter would be completely preposterous were it not musically potent enough to make up for the lyrics “on the day I was born, a guitar in my hand, the earth started rumbling a thunderous command … let there be shred!” (There are also images of fingers combusting, guitars squealing in delight as they’re beaten to death, pretenders being destroyed, etc.)On I Don’t Care, you get the punkish leanings that led Megadeth to cover Anarchy in the UK in 1988. More surprisingly, there are tracks rooted in the more melodic style the band controversially pursued in the mid-to-late 90s. If there’s a certain screw-you bullishness about this – 1997’s Cryptic Writings and 1999’s Risk seldom rank high among Megadeth fans’ favourite albums – there’s also a sense of Mustaine underlining that he’s actually pretty good at turning his attentions towards the radio-friendly, regardless of what he’s really known for: Puppet Parade in particular is really well written.Megadeth: Puppet Parade – videoAll of this is performed with the kind of technical precision for which Megadeth have long been famed: whatever one makes of the band’s constant lineup changes – the headcount of former members stands at 28 – contemporary guitarist Teemu Mäntysaari fits the band’s approach perfectly. But there are problems. The second half of the album noticeably lags, as if its career-summarising approach stretches to reminding listeners of the declining inspiration that’s haunted Megadeth’s fair-to-middling recent releases: Obey the Call is musically boring and laden with lyrics about ghostly puppetmasters controlling the world’s evils, reflecting Mustaine’s increasingly cranky and conspiracy-driven worldview, appearances on Infowars and all. He ends with The Final Note, which can’t work out whether it’s intent on tugging at longstanding fans’ heartstrings – “the final curtain falls, a quiet end to it all, now it’s just memories” – or heading off into retirement with middle finger aloft: “My last will, my final testament … my sneer.”Release the beast! How Iron Maiden and a naked Ralph Fiennes created the ultimate big-screen needle dropRead moreBut it isn’t his final sneer. That comes with a bonus track in which Megadeth take on Ride the Lightning, one of a handful of Metallica songs that Mustaine contributed to before being unceremoniously ejected from the band in 1983. It seems a weird way to conclude things: why end an album intended to celebrate your band’s legacy by dredging up the spectre of your sacking from another band? It’s certainly not as if Megadeth’s version radically reinvents the song in “this is how it’s done” style, beyond sounding more polished and growling. Is it a matter of underlining his claimed ownership over some of Metallica’s early material? Or simply for the purpose of grabbing extra attention for Megadeth’s final album? But then, Dave Mustaine has rarely needed much prompting to pick at the subject of being ousted from Metallica over the intervening 40-plus years. If nothing else, bringing it up one last time is very on brand, as is the rest of Megadeth, good and bad.This week Alexis listened toKavari – Iron VeinsNew Year cobwebs instantly blown away by the first track from Glasgow producer Kavari’s forthcoming EP: trace elements of old school hardcore, mid-90s Aphex Twin, industrial, but a finished product all her own.Explore more on these topicsMegadethAlexis Petridis's album of the weekMetalreviewsShareReuse this content"

These impressive accounts are elegant and thoughtful, his generous tone lit up from within with sufficient vibrato to caress the ear while simultaneously acknowledging current thinking on period performance practice.View image in fullscreenJohann Sebastian Bach: Sonatas & Partitas Renaud CapuconTempi are steady throughout, occasionally leisurely in slow movements, but always persuasive. There’s a generous body to his sound and a tasteful restraint when it comes to decoration. Phrasing is instinctual, his articulation of Bach’s fugal elements a model of clarity, while his sure-footed handling of the various doubles and prestos eschews any sense of virtuosity for virtuosity’s sake. In the mighty chaconne that ends the D minor partitas, Capuçon finds a reflective lightness and intimacy that frequently draws the ear.Where he engages in dramatics – in the bourrée of the first partita or in the concluding allegro of the second sonata – he digs deep into the strings, producing a beefier sound than Bach might have expected. Nevertheless, the musical cut and thrust is invariably leavened with delicate touches in earnest readings that manage to hit all the right emotional buttons.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

So he wrote his ownSupported byAbout this contentOliver HolmesThu 22 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 07.56 ESTShareThe dreaded school run is a daily battle for most parents. Even once out of the door and at the school gates, feigned smiles and small talk with other haggard parents can be a mass performance. For Stuart Green, who spent years wrestling his young twins out of car seats and into coats, all the while keeping an eye on his eldest daughter, it was the small talk he dreaded.“Is Mummy at work?” someone might ask. Green’s response would be a half truth: “I’m a single parent.” The full story could not be explained in a 15-second conversation on the street.Green’s wife, Mia Mascariñas-Green,was murderednearly a decade ago in the Philippines when two gunmen unloaded close to 30 bullets into her family car. Her three children were in the back seat. The Filipina human and environmental rights lawyer had no chance. Nine bullets hit her head and neck.It’s not about changing the facts, those remain the same – it’s about deciding what those facts mean for who you’re becomingSomehow, the twins, who were less than two at the time, and their older sister, who was 10, escaped unharmed. The family nanny, also in the car, survived. Green, who is British, describes his children as “walking, breathing, laughing miracles”.Having settled back in the UK, Green has spent years worrying that he and his family would be “defined by tragedy”. And if someone is reduced to the top results froma Google search of their name, then Green might appear to be an eternally grieving father in shock.Now he is ready to retell his story exactly the way he wants to – reframed from a negative light to a positive one.Green’s book,The Regenerate Leap, is being published this month. It offers advice to others who need to forge a path through a traumatic crisis – not only to survive but thrive.A marine biologist with a career in sustainability-focused consulting, his book is not just for parents but for anyone in a leadership role, whether that be in a family, a business or a community. In the opening chapter, Green calls his book “the manual I could not find”.View image in fullscreenGreen’s eldest daughter, Grace Sr, helped to edit the book.Photograph: Tom Pilston/GuardianIn the aftermath of the killing, he read books on grief and trauma but grew frustrated with the focus on “inner strength”.“In all the literature, it’s about being strong and resilient, and seeing your way through,” he says. That, he concluded, was not possible for his family – they had lost a wife, a mother, a home, their dogs, a whole life in a beloved country. “It was a wipeout,” he says. “So there is no resilience.”Still, Green did find one thing in those books, which scared rather than consoled him. It was the concept of intergenerational trauma, passed down from parents to children. “I realised that the children would be carrying on the narrative,” he says.The core idea of the book is the concept of “regeneration”, which he writes, is “not the absence of pain” but “transforming your pain into your purpose”.View image in fullscreenStuart Green’s book is published this month.Photograph: Tom Pilston/The GuardianThe book’s central metaphor is the pine cone that releases its seeds only under the intense heat of a forest fire. Green argues that crises can “crack us open” to release dormant strengths.“I’m not saying the devastation is good,” he writes. The philosophy is to honestly acknowledge the loss, then to use the crisis as a catalyst to grow into something that could never have existed without the “fire”.When his children were very young, Green held back on details of the attack. Today, they know the whole truth but, as the book says, it gave them an “empowering truth”: that “their mother died fighting for justice, and they carry her courage forward”.He points to his eldest daughter, Grace Sr. He says her therapist described her as having grown from a “traumatised teenager into a young woman of remarkable wisdom, purpose and capability”.Surviving a crisis left her with exceptional strength – when she was 10 she testified in court over the murder of her mother and attempted murder of her and her younger siblings.The case is continuing in thePhilippines, with one person detained and another at large.Now 18, Grace Sr plans to become a lawyer, like her mother. It was her idea to write the book to help others, and the father and daughter spent last summer editing the stories together to make sure it was readable for young people affected by life’s inevitable horrors.“It’s not about changing the facts, those remain the same,” Green writes. “It’s about deciding what those facts mean for who you’re becoming and where you’re going.”British man on mission for justice after wife gunned down in PhilippinesRead moreWriting has helped the family’s regeneration, says Green. “The most profound reframe is the shift from victim to author; from someone to whom things happen to someone who chooses what those things mean and what comes next,” he writes.Reflecting on the past eight years, Green says he needs to “flip the narrative”, to “take this horrible situation and make it as positive as it can be”.Is he nervous about the extra attention that publishing this book will lead to, and more probing questions on the school run? Absolutely, but Green is accepting of it.“I guess in another way, it’s for me to just also challenge myself to embrace that this is my reality,” he says. “This is my way to share it.”The Regenerate Leapis published on 28 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentRights and freedomPhilippinesAsia PacificHuman rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s the latest in a string of reading-focused government initiatives, the flagship being the education department’s National Year of Reading 2026, which kicked off last week with an event at the Emirates Stadium in London.The Year of Reading campaign comes on the back ofresearch by the National Literacy Trust(NLT), which found reading enjoyment among children and young people is at its lowest recorded level, with just one in three of those aged eight to 18 now reporting enjoying reading “very much” or “quite a lot”.The year-long campaign aims to work with schools, communities, libraries and early years settings to boost reading for pleasure and, in doing so, “give kids the best start in life”.Other plans are in the works too. In September,Rachel Reeves pledgedthat every state primary school in England will have a library by the end of this parliament. In late November,an inquiryinto reading for pleasure was launched. Non-government schemes are also under way, with theChildren’s Booker prizelaunched in October.View image in fullscreenThe education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, talks with pupils at Welland Academy, Peterborough.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA“It’s about making reading seem as natural and everyday as breathing,” says Noughts & Crosses author and former children’s laureate Malorie Blackman, who is among a star-studded list of ambassadors for the Year of Reading campaign. “Reading is so important for understanding the world around you. It’s very easy to become laser-focused on just your own experiences, but reading gives you a way of expanding your horizons, learning about other people and other ways of thinking and feeling and doing. We’re in danger of losing that ability to connect and communicate.”As a child, it was access to a local library that first sparked Blackman’s love of reading. “I used to live in my local library. I didn’t actually go into a bookshop until I was 14, because I couldn’t afford the books,” she says. “Having a public library within walking distance, and the revelation that I could read any and all of the books, made me who I am.”This is the third National Year of Reading campaign, after earlier iterations in 1998 and 2008. But as the first in the era of widespread smartphone use and streaming, the campaign will focus on all forms of reading material – something Blackman is passionate about.“I think reading has got a reputation for being this overly worthy, solitary activity, and it so isn’t,” she says. “There are so many types of reading you can do. There’s nothing wrong with, for example, reading graphic novels or comic books. If you’re into cars or motorbikes or whatever it might be – whatever hobby or pastime – you can get more out of it if you read about it.”View image in fullscreen‘I used to live in my local library’ … Malorie Blackman signs a book for a young fan at the Hay festival during her time as children’s laureate.Photograph: Steven May/AlamyReading “doesn’t seem to offer the immediate social rewards that motivate us today,” says Jonathan Douglas, chief executive of the NLT, which is helping the government deliver the campaign. “It’s seen as slow, solitary, and studious in a world that values speed, status and spectacle.”The DfE is encouraging parents to “lead by example” when it comes to reading habits, and to read with their children. “Shared reading in the very early years is the most impactful way to build a lifelong love for reading,” says Julie Hayward, director of partnerships for BookTrust, one of the campaign partners. Reading with children under six also helps with self-regulation, empathy and bonding.Hayward acknowledges that access to reading is not a level playing field. Barriers parents might face in reading with their children include having had a “negative kind of educational journey” or “low confidence in their own literacy levels”.The campaign approach is key, adds Hayward. “We shouldn’t be judgmental or preachy. It should be fun and joyful.” The 2026 campaign “focuses on appeal, not duty, and highlights the immediate rewards of reading, making it feel relevant, exciting and rewarding right now, not just in the future,” says Douglas.While the focus on enjoyment makes intuitive sense, studies on childhood reading suggest it could be overly narrow.Research by Sabine Little, a senior language education lecturer at the University of Sheffield, found that multilingual children spend more time reading for pleasure than monolingual children, and read a wider variety of texts and formats.Multilingual children typically think about the importance of reading in a broader range of ways, explains Little. When she asked multilingual children she worked with to list three things they had read that were important to them, there were “very, very few” books that were included “because of the plot or because they were favourites. It was much more to do with the connections that the books facilitated” – for example, “the first book read in a new country, the book that introduced them to a new hobby”.The Guardian view on the National Year of Reading 2026: time to start a healthy habit for life | EditorialRead moreOne child cited racehorse listings in Hungarian, because he read those with his grandmother when he was visiting Hungary. Little believes we can learn from the way multilingual children forge connections to books and apply this with monolingual children too. Validating reading material that holds importance to them in different ways would help create a better culture around reading.For Hayward, the newly launched Children’s Booker prize is a huge step forward. The first winner will be announced in early 2027, with £50,000 awarded for the best fiction for readers aged eight to 12, decided by a mixed panel of adult and child judges. The Booker prize foundation will also give 30,000 copies of shortlisted and winning books to children each year.While more attention for children’s books is always positive, Steven Pryse, who co-owns the independent children’s bookshop Pickled Pepper Books in north London, is sceptical about the prize’s impact. “The children’s book award scene is crowded, and I’m not convinced the Children’s Booker will make much of a difference.”There is “a fear as well that the prize might pick up on literary books rather than stuff that is more accessible, which, for me, might be a bit of a danger, with things becoming a little hierarchical.”However, Little says the prize will create a good opportunity for children to discuss reading in the way they discuss games, television and social media. “One of the things children enjoy doing is speaking about books to their peers.” She is “super excited” that the new prize will include books in translation and has the potential to show that books from different cultures and originally written in languages other than English are a valuable part of British children’s literature.“It’s important for the authors and the publishing houses, but it’s especially important for children”, explains Hayward, “to have great books that are really exciting and engaging, that they can see themselves in.” Ultimately, the Children’s Booker and the Year of Reading have the same aim: encouraging children to discover books they’ll enjoy. “Whatever you’re into, there are books out there for you,” says Blackman. “When people say to me that they don’t like reading, I always say to them: you just haven’t found the right book yet.”5 tips to get children readingMake it fun“We’re surrounded by words and stories all the time – read the adverts on the bus or on billboards together,” says Pryse. “Reading doesn’t have to always mean a book – try reading a recipe together, or making up a story based on your shopping list.”Create a relaxed environmentLittle encourages parents not to panic if there is a period when their child isn’t reading as much, adding that the more you push children, the more you create a pressurised environment around reading.Share stories early“Share stories in the early years, so when children get into school, it doesn’t all become about homework,” says Hayward.Read yourself“Let your kids see you reading, even if it’s a magazine or newspaper,” says Pryse. “Why not revisit some classics from your own childhood and share them with them.”Let them read what they want“Let children gravitate to the books that capture their interest, even if they seem ‘lightweight’,” says Sarah Satha, who co-founded Inclusive Books for Children (IBC). “Supplement these with award shortlists – Carnegie, Booker, The Week Junior or IBC awards – and don’t be afraid to experiment with genres, formats, and reading levels until you find what hooks them in.”Explore more on these topicsBooksChildren and teenagersLiteracyLibrariesChildren's Booker prizefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m afraid that this former (British) Vogue intern did not pass muster: wrong era, wrong country.A woman who almost certainly would pass with flying colours is the former Vogue staffer Caroline Palmer, now the author of a novel, Workhorse, set at “the magazine” during the dying days of a golden age of women’s glossies, when the lunches were boozy, the couture was free and almost anything could be expensed. In this first decade of the new millennium, we meet Clodagh, or Clo, a suburban twentysomething “workhorse” trying to make it in a world of rich, beautiful, well-connected “show horses”, and willing to do almost anything to get there.The women’s magazine has an established literary history, from The Bell Jar to The Devil Wears Prada. So too does the genre we’ll call “young woman comes of age in New York City” – I’m thinking of books such as The Girls’ Guide to Hunting and Fishing, Rules of Civility and My Salinger Year. Then there’s the grifter narrative (The Talented Mr Ripley,Emma Cline’s The Guest, Gatsby, even Breakfast at Tiffany’s). The grifter isn’t solely an American phenomenon, but it makes the most sense there; a new country without an aristocracy, where reinvention always feels possible. Workhorse is a novel that ticks so many boxes it’s unsurprising that it provoked a bidding war. It even has that most fashionable of protagonists: a highly dislikable heroine.Workhorse is a novel that ticks so many boxes it’s unsurprising that it provoked a bidding warClo is a liar, a thief and an alcoholic who brims with class envy and internalised misogyny. The way she describes other women is often vile, though sometimes hilarious: “she looks particularly haggard tonight in the harsh kitchen lighting, like when you spot a famous actress buying bananas at a Midtown bodega”. It feels fitting for a character who finds herself in a working environment where people say things such as “there is nothing more disgusting than seeing a woman eat the appetisers at a cocktail party”. Despite Clo’s unpleasantness, as is the way with these novels, you cannot help but root for her – initially, at least. Workhorse follows her from her days as an underling to an Upper East Side apartment and a job as an editor. Watching her get there is, at times, tremendous fun. Palmer has a talent for wit, and Clo’s observations on the foibles of the fashion industry are razor-sharp. Her dark obsession with the beautiful, well-bred Davis Lawrence, a colleague at the magazine and the daughter of one of the most awful mothers I have ever encountered in fiction, is well drawn, as is her friend Harry, the real Holly Golightly of the story. Here are two people who ooze charisma, where the seething, grasping, increasingly desperate Clo has none.That, ultimately, is the novel’s problem. It’s not that young women don’t deserve to be the subject of Goldfinch-length epics, and I have no childish aversion to unlikable characters. I did, though, perhaps wish I didn’t have to spend so much time with Clo. Workhorse comes in at more than 500 pages, which is a long time to be in anyone’s head. Perhaps it is an issue of the first person, and a close third person would have worked better. Regardless, you could have cut a full third of this novel and I don’t think it would have suffered for it. If anything, that would have allowed some of Palmer’s truly brilliant writing – such as her gorgeous description of a New York power cut – to further stand out.That the fashion industry can be shallow and ruthless is news to no one. The Devil Wears Prada was published 22 years ago, and we are now in a post-Wintour era. It’s hard to know how interested the general reader will be in another nostalgic swansong for the heyday of magazine publishing. I enjoyed a glimpse at the glamour immensely, though it’s always, in a sensation familiar to all journalists, tinged with the feeling that you got into the game just as the party at Bungalow 8 was ending. What elevates Workhorse beyond its central theme is a more profound exploration of the emotional burden carried by the perpetual outsider; what a weight – and a waste – such an envy and ambition entails, how one day you turn around and find that you have “burn[ed] through an entire decade in a single night”. As one of the characters says: “you grow up with all these questions you really want answered … Am I going to get married? Or will I have kids or a good job or whatever, and then when you start to get the answers, it feels sad?”Workhorse by Caroline Palmer is published by 4th Estate (£16.99).

Provocation though? In spades. As a student at the Beijing Film Academy in the late 1970s, he joined an artist group called Stars that had a slogan: “We Demand Political Democracy and Artistic Freedom”. In the 1990s, returning to Beijing after a decade in downtown New York, he and a couple of friends published and distributed samizdat-style books devoted to off-piste, often-political art of the kind that government censors tend to fear.Ai’s own work was bolshie and anathema to custodians of good taste. His Study of Perspective series showed him raising a middle finger at global sites – among them Tiananmen Square, the Eiffel Tower, the White House – that are expected to produce awe, delight, reverence. In the self-explanatory photographic sequence Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn (1995), itself the follow-up to Han Jar Overpainted with Coca-Cola Logo (1994), he asked viewers to decide who was the bigger cultural vandal: himself, a mere artist – or a Chinese state for whom iconoclasm was a defining feature of its modernising project. A 2000 exhibition in Shanghai that he helped to stage bore the name Fuck Off. (Its Chinese subtitle was “Ways to Not Cooperate’”.)If anything, Ai’s talent to bemuse and enrage has only intensified in recent decades. A blog he wrote between 2005 and 2009 (posts had titles such as How Could We Have Degenerated To This? and If You Aren’t Anti-China, Are You Still Human?) scandalised the authorities and was yanked off the internet. His email and bank accounts have been repeatedly hacked. A studio complex he designed was demolished. Violent police treatment led to internal bleeding and emergency brain surgery. Later he was detained and placed under house arrest for 81 days.Given that there can be few contemporary artists who have thought more about censorship – its goals, techniques, efficacy – than Ai, it’s inevitable this new book, which runs to fewer than 90 pages, will be read as his distilled wisdom on the topic. Censorship, he asserts, is no new phenomenon: during the Shang dynasty (1600-1046BC) a saying emerged – “the great affairs of the state are worship and military bases”.But Ai’s main argument is that censorship is neither a uniquely Chinese phenomenon, nor something confined to “countries defined as autocratic and authoritarian”. In the west – “the so-called free world”, with its “ostensibly democratic societies” – free speech is a chimera, regulated through “more covert, more deceptive and more corrosive” means. Flexing his rhetoric, he describes censorship “as both an indispensable tool of mental enslavement and a fundamental source of political corruption”.Overblown? Ai is fond of generalisations. “When a work of thought or expression gains widespread public acceptance or adoration, it often signals a lack of depth or a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose” – by that sweeping logic, his own art, which has been exhibited across the world, must also be depthless. No translator is listed, so we must assume he himself is responsible for the book’s many Victor Meldrew-isms (“Values such as effort, responsibility and the preservation of life’s dignity are replaced by materialism, fleeting pleasure and shallow entertainment”) or LinkedIn bromides (he has, he says, “consistently raised questions about human values and rights, engaging in debates that inevitably touch on issues of social justice, fairness, the legitimacy of power and the execution of judicial justice”).Ai refers to his poet father Qing’s misfortunes – “his life was marked by suffering and our family endured punishment alongside him” – but the fuller story appears in Ai’s 2021 memoir, 1000 Years of Joys and Sorrows. Jailed for being a leftist by the nationalists in 1932, Qing was imprisoned again in 1957 for being a rightist: ink was poured on his face, kids pelted him with stones, he was forced to clean public toilets and lived with his son in a self-dug hole in the ground for a decade.On Censorship is at its liveliest when Ai ponders artificial intelligence. Friends who mention his name to ChatGPT are reportedly told, “Let’s talk about something else.” The chatbot also claims – with stochastic self-assurance – that a selfie Ai took with Alice Weidel, leader of the German AfD party, is a fake. His belief in the fundamental importance of individuals runs counter to the theology of big data: “Individuals are reduced to a transparent, jelly-like state within society – formless, uniform and stripped of distinction.” Artificial intelligence, he believes, represents a “profound existential crisis for humanity – the virus infiltrates the central nervous system of human cognition”.Much more barbed and more suggestive than Ai’s prose are the images he marshals: a listening device found in his studio; bored undercover policemen meant to be keeping tabs on him; a still of him being interrogated from the video for a heavy-metal song called Dumbass; him raising his middle finger to the surveillance goons outside his Beijing studio. For Ai, as for many artists, their deepest thinking is their work itself.On Censorship by Ai Weiwei is published by Thames & Hudson (£12.99).

Standing on the trapdoor causes it to yawn open like iron jaws, dropping you through a vertical shaft into a subterranean museum. Here, dozens of doors line the walls of three vaulted grey galleries, each leading to a pocket dimension of dizzying virtual architecture and fierce gladiatorial combat.Welcome to Quake Brutalist Jam, the hottest community event for lovers of id Software’s classic first-person shooter from 1996. First run in 2022, the Jam started out as a celebration of old-school 3D level design, where veteran game developers, aspiring level designers and enthusiast modders gather to construct new maps and missions themed around the austere minimalism of brutalist architecture.This third iteration of the Jam goes much further. In an intense six-week session, contributors designed 77 brutalist-themed maps where players fight new enemies with new weapons. For context, the original Quake, built by legendary game designers such as John Carmack, John Romero, Tim Willits and American McGee, featured 37 levels when it was first released.View image in fullscreen‘Brutalism won by a wide margin’ … Quake Brutalist Game Jam.Photograph: id SoftwareBen Hale is the event’s concierge, a professional game developer working as seniorenvironment artist on the forthcoming survival game Subnautica 2. As a child, Hale learned to build Quake levels with the encouragement of his older brother. “He was very supportive, despite how often I bluescreened his computer,” Hale recalls.The idea for a brutalism-themed “jam” – a hobbyist term for an intensive, community game development session that takes place over several days or weeks – came from another Quake mapper named Benoit Stordeur, inspired by a set of concrete textures Hale designed for Quake. “I posted a poll [of themes] for the community to vote on, with brutalism as a choice. Brutalism won by a wide margin,” Hale says.The firstQuake Brutalist Jamcaptured the community’s imagination, with participants producing 35 levels in two-and-a-half weeks using Hale’s concrete textures. In a game that already features oppressive gothic and industrial environments, the moody stylings of brutalism proved powerful creative fuel. “So many brutalist buildings look like cool sci-fi structures or evil lairs,” Hale says. Thesecond jamran in 2023, spawning 30 more proudly grey levels for players to blast through.But as he began planning a third jam, Hale ran into some health issues. “I pitched to my friend, Fairweather, to be my cohost this year,” Hale says. “They made the suggestion that we do something a little different this time.”View image in fullscreen‘Ideas began to grow’ … Quake Brutalist Game Jam.Photograph: id SoftwareFairweather is Lain Fleming, a veteran modder who has led numerous community Quake projects includingDwell,Remix Jamand theCoffee Quakeseries. Rather than simply make new levels for Quake, Fleming suggested giving the Jam’s participants some new tools to work with. “When we began, we simply wanted to visually overhaul some weapons and monsters. But as we did more and more, ideas began to grow,” Fleming says. “We analysed mechanical gaps in the arsenal and enemies, which resulted in many new enemy paradigms you rarely see in Quake.”This type of mod, known as a total conversion, proved far more ambitious than Hale or Fleming anticipated. “What was supposed to be a quick six-month mod to host a jam in became a two-year monstrosity. The list of people contributing grew bigger over time, with a team of about 15 near the end,” Hale says.Despite the challenges, the team ultimately produced an almost entirely new toolset for Quake. Virtually every available weapon is new or heavily modified, including a shotgun with bouncing projectiles, a gun that launches iron rebars, and a cluster-missile launcher. Enemies, meanwhile, mix redesigned Quake staples with entirely new foes.The overhaul proved hugely successful. Quake Brutalist Jam 3 had more than double the number of participants for previous jams – so many that Hale had to radically alter his plans for the Start map, the playable mission-select screen that’s something of a Quake tradition. “I opted for a museum or gallery approach,” Hale says. “We had to pack the maps very tightly, which I struggled with a lot.”The range of levels contributed by the community is enormous. There are quickfire experiments that last a matter of minutes, high-intensity “slaughtermaps” designed to test player reflexes, ambitious, narrative-driven exploration levels that pay tribute to the form and shape of virtual architecture, and gargantuan gun-fests that last an hour or longer.View image in fullscreen‘Doubts would lead to slower progress’ … Mazu’s Quake Brutalist level.Photograph: id SoftwareIndeed, the featured map, Escape from KOE-37, is almost a game in its own right – an epic three-hour affair heavily inspired by Half-Life with its own storyline and more than 1,000 enemies to fight. Its creator, who goes by the online handle Mazu, is a veteran of the Quake mapping community who spent about 400 hours building it. “Environmental puzzles and set-pieces are just really fun to do. [I] really wanted to have interactive environments for players to explore,” he says. “I just allow my creativity to put ideas into my map without axing too many of them. Doubts would lead to slower progress.”Maps such as KOE-37 highlight the remarkable work that community members have been doing for years in a space that professional game design has long since abdicated. Once the most popular genre around, linear, single-player first-person shooters have become relatively rare in mainstream game development, pushed to one side in favour of sprawling open worlds and multiplayer experiences. As such, the particular level design that games like Doom and Quake specialise in – complex 3D mazes where navigation is as much a part of the challenge as combat – is at risk of becoming a lost art.Yet events such as QBJ3, alongside other Quake mods such asArcane DimensionsandThe Immortal Lockare not only keeping this style of virtual architecture alive, they often surpass the achievements of the old masters, twisting and warping and spooling out 3D geometry in ways that wouldn’t have been possible 30 years ago: “With these games, you have such a rich, decades-long history of levels to play that you can refine your own designs to a razor’s edge,” Fleming says.View image in fullscreen‘Everyone shows off’ … from Robert Yang’s contribution.Photograph: id SoftwareQuake Brutalist Jam 3 isn’t just for hardcore Quake fans and shooter addicts. This year’s Start map has a section dedicated to newcomers with little to no mapping experience. At the other end of the spectrum, it has also seen contributions from industry professionals such as game designer and former teacher at New York University’s Game Centre, Robert Yang.“It’s the underground Met Gala of concrete murderzone design, the biggest event on the Quake calendar,” Yang says. “Everyone shows off, everyone nurtures the new faces, everybody eats. I love it.”For his contribution, One Need Not Be a House, Yang created an open-ended map that, were it not for all the heavily armed soldiers milling about, wouldn’t look out of place in an adventure game like Myst. “My map started as a study of the architectLouis Kahn’s ‘brick brutalism masterpieces – theNational Assemblycomplex in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and theIndian Institute of Managementin Ahmedabad [in India],” he says.Open-ended levels can be tricky, and highly unusual for a Quake map. To help solve this problem, Yang looked to one of the most famous levels from Halo: Combat Evolved –The Silent Cartographer. “I wanted to make a similar non-linear map but with many branching paths, so you can mix and match your own route, get powerups out of order, and feel like you’re getting away with something.”Yang says he doesn’t particularly like playing Quake as a shooter, but he admires how Quake Brutalist Jam 3 hints at a potential alternative way of making games, one that is driven by community rather than profit. “Brutalism, especially in the UK, is about building for the public. You don’t need to add beautiful ornaments because building and nurturing the future is already beautiful,” he says. “And that’s what Quake Brutalism is about too, a socialist utopia where handcrafted video games are a free public good that brings people together.”It may not be long before Hale, along with Fleming and the other organisers, put such an idea into practice. Their next planned project is their own video game, one that’s fully independent of id Software’s shooter. “After this jam, we’re taking a bit of a break from modding and mapping for Quake,” Hale concludes. “We love the community and the continuous celebration of each other’s work and aren’t going anywhere. But also, we want to just make a game. We’ve been wanting to do that for so long it’s starting to hurt.”Explore more on these topicsGamesArchitecturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

While on one hand, audiences may feel that there’s only so much Trumpian lunacy they can take, it also means that newcomer Leigh Douglas’s satirical one-woman show – which had a sold-out run at the Edinburgh fringe last year – couldn’t feel more timely.The Irish-born, American-raised comic plays Chastity Quirke, a sorority girl turned White House receptionist working for president Ronald Drumpf, whose administration is highly sexist (and other “ists” besides). She begins the show with a fervour for conservatism and a love of Maga-style beauty standards, requesting that the audience scream if they believe in “[making] America hot again”, and gyrating suggestively whenever she gets the chance.Chastity isn’t, she insists, merely here to be “window dressing for the Drumpf administration”, and sees herself as a crucial part of his operation. But a disembodied narrator – also in Chastity’s voice – hints at trouble to come. Drumpf, we learn, plans to unlawfully stay in office past two terms. Chastity is privy to his plot, but will she do as she is told and quietly burn the incriminating documents that her boss has secreted in a Whole Foods carrier bag?‘It feels so taboo’: Natalie Palamides on playing both halves of a toxic couple and her shocking next showRead moreDouglas is a seriously funny performer who plays not just Chastity but an array of side characters in this 70-minute show, ably directed by Fiona Kingwill. For Drumpf’s men, she leans into bad posture and lecherous gazes, while the women are largely sprightly and coquettish, and the sparse set never feels too limited to bend to each new personage.While great fun at first, however, it slowly runs out of juice. As we teeter unevenly towards the end of the show, the gags become less biting and the lines more broad, among them a take on the oft-quoted poem First They Came by Martin Niemöller, about apathy in the face of nazism (“First they came for the immigrant families”, laments Chastity, “and I said nothing, ’cause I wanted the boys to like me”).The show ends tensely and abruptly, blunting its spikier moments of satire. Still, there is much to appreciate here, and Douglas and Kingwill have nailed what makes Maga women tick: not just a yearning to be pretty, but a lust for power too.AtPark theatre, London, until 7 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)US politicsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The result is heartfelt, though its emotional bite can seem uncertainArifa AkbarWed 21 Jan 2026 19.04 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 13.55 ESTShareArevival ofThornton Wilder’s great American playabout a provincial town, north of New York, might have carried strong state-of-the-nation resonances at this dark, Trumpian juncture. So it initially seems counterintuitive that this inaugural show for the newWelsh National Theatre, which Michael Sheen has heroically championed, transposes the US backwater to Wales.But Wilder’s play, premiering in the interwar years, in 1938, is more eternal than political, dramatising a close-knit community navigating life, love and death. And the transposition is convincing here, in spirit, encapsulating the lilt of its Welshness, noisier, more playful and lyrical than the original, especially in its glowing visual imagination and movement design by Jess Williams as well as its emotional lighting by Ryan Joseph Stafford.Comprising three acts and emphatically aware of its theatricality, the drama’s “stage manager”, played by Sheen, takes us to one morning in 1901 when we see the early bud of romance between young George Gibbs (Peter Devlin) and Emily Webb (Yasemin Özdemir). Three years later, that has bloomed into marriage. The final act jumps to the town’s cemetery, and an untimely death, in 1913. The stage manager casts his narrative eye over the town, describing, ruminating, introducing scenes before interrupting them and stepping in to play various characters too. Sheen, with waistcoat and watch-chain, is in his element, mixing mischievousness, earnestness and bathos.View image in fullscreenEarly bud of romance … Peter Devlin and Yasemin Özdemir in Our Town.Photograph: Helen MurrayThe set of this play is traditionally empty, filled mainly with the stage manager’s description of it, but Hayley Grindle’s design is well arranged so that its emptiness engages our imaginations while using props with economy, such as the wooden planks that make up the edifice of the town, that are reused in expressionist ways.It is a handsome production overall, filled with abundant physicality and some moments spark with magic, but there are also some broader inconsistencies. While the production feels Welsh in spirit and look – there is period costume, Welsh accents and names – its reference points are still prevailing American. This is a town made up of mostly Republicans, there are mentions of New Hampshire, the US constitution, the Louisiana Purchase and high school. This lends the production an unreal quality, unhinged from its original geography but also locked into it. Does the long strip of azure sky in the backdrop belong to the valleys or the US mountains? You yearn for “more” Welshness in its fibre.View image in fullscreenSome moments spark with magic … Our Town.Photograph: Helen MurrayIn a production directed by Francesca Goodridge, with Russell T Davies as creative associate, the setting of Grover’s Corners contains the romance and nostalgia of a bygone community, not unlike like Dylan Thomas’s fishing village of Llareggub in Under Milk Wood,which Sheen starred in at the National Theatre(Thomas was, in fact, said to have known Wilder and this play). But the first two acts come without Thomas’s deft play of darkness and light, the romantic and bitterly tragic. There is too much light and warmth, and not enough tension or conflict, so that this community, until the final, shortest act, seems like The Waltons in south Wales.‘I can’t waste this’: Michael Sheen on his riskiest role yet – saving Wales’s national theatreRead moreWhen the darkness comes, it brings a ghostly scene reminiscent of A Christmas Carol. The dead, as they talk to each other, sound like Greek gods, impervious to human vulnerability and suffering. It’s an interesting interpretation but emotionally distancing.Grover’s Corners is a nice town, we are told, though no one remarkable ever came out of it, and you assume this might be a failing: that it throttles anything out of the ordinary. The production’s treatment of the town drunk, Simon (Rhys Warrington), makes just that point through a fantastically deft piece of mime that insinuates him as a gay man trapped by small-town mores.But its “ordinariness” carries a moral lesson and that is to relish the gloriously quotidian moments in life. It’s sentimental, like a version of It’s a Wonderful Life, but without the sense of ecstatic uplift at the end. “You’re 21, you’re 22, and whack, you’re 70,” reflects the narrator. It’s finger-wagging in its message, but it works. Look up, drink in ordinary life, because it goes too fast.

Disco, Occasionally. In an era when fans clinically investigate every aspect of pop stars’ lives, it was perhaps inevitable that Styles’s choice of punctuation would draw scrutiny.Harry Styles announces fourth solo album, Kiss All the Time. Disco, OccasionallyRead moreThe key dilemma: is the comma in the right place? “We’re going through a really experimental period with comma usage,” wrote @poeticdweller inan X postwith nearly 1m views. One concern appeared to be that the two sentences don’t follow the same rules: “The comma turns the second sentence from a parallel imperative sentence to a fragment that vaguely gestures toward the occasional presence of disco,”noted anotherpost, in a sentimentechoed elsewhere.It all raises two questions: one, did Styles get it wrong? And two, does it matter? (Question three is, of course: who cares? But it’s nice to have a distraction from the daily horrors.)View image in fullscreenThe album art for Harry Styles’s Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally., out 6 March.Photograph: Columbia Records/PAAs for the first question, it’s true that the lines are not parallel. If Harry is speaking in the imperative, telling us to kiss constantly and also to sometimes go to the disco – using “disco” as a verb – then it would be consistent to leave out the comma. But that doesn’t necessarily mean Styles is doing anything wrong.“It’s not a perfect construction by our grammatical standards and that’s fun,” says Britt Edelen, AKA @poeticdweller, who wrote theviral postand is a PhD candidate in English at Duke. The result, intentional or not, is that “it adds some kineticism to what would otherwise be boring” and “fits into a larger scheme of people trying to articulate things via commas that aren’t actually how we use them”. He cites Virginia Woolf – known forlong, heavily punctuated sentences– as one example; more recently, the movie Die My Love leaves out a comma where we might expect one.I think Americans are overly punctilious punctuators. They tend to pay attention to rules and prohibitions a lotEllen JovinAlso, disco is not usually a verb. “When I see ‘disco, comma’, it’s giving me a little bit of a mental break,” says Ellen Jovin, author of several books on grammar and star of the road-trip docu-comedyRebel With a Clause, in which she traveled the country forging connections through conversations about sentence structure and punctuation. Edelen agrees: the comma, he says, was probably added to “render the time of speech graphically, as in: disco [pause] occasionally”.In the second sentence, Styles has “changed parts of speech. I’m now working with a noun, and then it’s kind of playful”, he says. The comma leads to “a different adverbial idea: not all the time, just occasionally”. And Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally. is surreal language to begin with – it’s unlikely you’d see the phrase come up in a research paper or international treaty. “People are trying to impose some sort of standard sentence punctuation on something that’s not that at all,” Jovin says.On top of that, the context matters: this is an album title, not high school English. Even if itwereEnglish class, you would see this sort of thing in a novel – “commas that you would say the same kind of thing about: ‘Wait, that’s not right. That doesn’t belong there,’” Jovin says. “This is just creativity, and I think it’s perfect.’”The visuals matter here too; maybe Styles just likes the way the comma looks, especially in a world where we see song and album titles more and more. Unlike physical media – or early MP3s, which gave users some control over metadata like song names – music-streaming apps proudly display the title of each song on our phones with the artist’s preferred styling and punctuation. Artists have played with this ability in recent years: on Billie Eilish’s 2017 EP dont smile at me, for instance, most of the song titles were lowercase, while they were in all caps on 2024’s HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. Dijon’s album Baby, from last year, includes tracks titled HIGHER! and (Freak It). In the last week of 2018, according to aQuartz analysis, eight of Spotify’s Top 200 songs were styled in all caps or all lowercase; the next year, “more than 30 songs in a typical week” contained “non-standard capitalization”. (Quartz theorizes that the trend is related to the informality of texting.)It’s worth remembering that grammar rules are fluid and change from stylebook to stylebook, which is why, for instance, the album and film titles in this article are not italicized or put in quotes (see “titles”). Unlike the perception we might develop in school, there is no Official Global Consortium of Correct English whose henchmen will break your knees over a comma splice. “I think Americans are overly punctilious punctuators. They tend to pay attention to rules and prohibitions a lot,” Jovin says.From Chalamet to Mescal: why are celebrity lookalike competitions everywhere?Read moreThat’s not to say that grammar never matters, of course. There are plenty of rules that stylebooks and experts do agree on, and what counts is clarity. Take theexample from the Guardian style guideabout the importance of a well-placed comma: there’s a difference between dedicating a book “to my parents, Martin Amis and JK Rowling” and “to my parents, Martin Amis, and JK Rowling”.When it comes to an album title, on the other hand, ambiguity may be exactly the goal.In a possible case ofnominative determinism, Stylesclearly demonstratedhis penchant for grammar at a 2015 show, adding an apostrophe and an E to a Philadelphia fan’s sign so it said “You’re so nice” rather than “your so nice” (he then wrote “thank you – love, Harry” and gave it back, in case there was any doubt about the sign’s message). If Styles is a grammar nerd, the controversial comma was probably meant to be.Explore more on these topicsHarry StylesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And is it different to the Paris agreement? – videoThe dispute highlights a wider tension between environmental protection and initiatives to demolish and rebuild estates. AcrossLondon, more than 130 housing estates are earmarked for demolition.When it was built, the estate was described as “a town of tomorrow” by Greater London Council architects, though residents say it later fell into disrepair.Land values in the area haverisen since the opening of the Elizabeth linein 2022, which reduced journey times into central London.The legal challenge centres on the climate impact of the proposed demolition, arguing that the council and Peabody have underestimated the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) the project would generate.While the development’s environmental statement acknowledges that the resulting emissions would be significant, lawyers acting for Turk argue that the assessment was carried out only against an illustrative masterplan rather than the “reasonable worst-case scenario” required under planning law.View image in fullscreenA still from the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyTurk said: “I’m challenging the redevelopment because I don’t believe it’s in the interest or consideration of the residents who have lived here between 15 and 40 years. The environmental impact placed on residents, such as myself, will undoubtedly cause health problems for us.”Saskia O’Hara, a legal caseworker at the Public Interest Law Centre, representing residents seeking the judicial review, said: “Across London, approximately 137 housing estates are marked for demolition. These projects generate substantial greenhouse gas emissions, calling into question our stated commitment to achieving net zero by 2050.“At a minimum, estate residents and the wider public are entitled to assurance that these emissions are accurately assessed, transparently documented and lawfully disclosed to the decision-makers charged with determining whether demolition should proceed.“This case exemplifies the point at which the displacement of established communities coincides with irreversible environmental harm and is therefore a matter of substantial public interest and concern.”A spokesperson for Peabody said: “We’re investing in communities in and around South Thamesmead, supporting people, improving public areas and providing much-needed new homes. The planned redevelopment of the Lesnes estate will help us expand this work and create an even better place for local people to live.“We will address any legal inquiries that may come up and will continue to support residents during this period of transition.”Bexley council said: “As the matter is live it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.”Explore more on these topicsSocial housingLondonA Clockwork OrangeRegenerationCommunitiesHousingLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

As well as alumni from the 1995 album – Portishead’s Beth Gibbons and Blur’s Damon Albarn and Graham Coxon – and legends such as Pulp, Beck and Depeche Mode, there are a host of successful younger musicians including Olivia Rodrigo, Fontaines DC, Cameron Winter, Wet Leg and Sampha.Oscar-nominated film-makerJonathan Glazeralso contributed to the project, working with children in war zones across Ukraine, Gaza, Yemen and Sudan to create their own films, and recruiting children in the UK to document the making of the project.Arctic Monkeys, whose debut album turns 20 this week, said in a statement: “We are proud to support the invaluable work War Child do and hope the record will make a positive difference to the lives of children affected by war.”James Ford, who has produced or co-produced all but one of the Arctic Monkeys’ albums, oversaw the album which was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in November.“The original Help meant a lot to me and to have the opportunity, given the current news cycle, to help galvanise our music community into doing something as unarguably positive as helping children in war zones seemed like a no-brainer,” he said. “The experience of making the album itself has been very powerful, and dare I say life-affirming.”War Child estimates that the number of children affected globally by war has jumped from one in 10 when the 1995 compilation was released, to one in five today, around 520 million children.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockArctic MonkeysJonathan GlazernewsShareReuse this content"

It’ll be the first to take place without its founder, Robert Redford,who died last September at the age of 89, and it’ll be the last to take place in Utah, where it has been since the very beginning back in 1978.American independent cinema owes much to Sundance king Robert Redford | Adrian HortonRead moreEmotions, which are often on display regardless thanks to films often ruthlessly designed to elicit them, will be high, with events planned to commemorate a figure who helped create a launchpad and then an ecosystem for American indies. But while saying goodbye to both Redford and Park City will be front and centre, Sundance isn’t Sundance without a roster of films to also get attenders talking. Last year, it felt like that chatter was less effusive than usual because while there were films that continued evoking conversation throughout the year (Sorry, Baby, If I Had Legs I’d Kick You, Train Dreams, Lurker, Twinless, pretty much every documentary premiere) there were more that either died on arrival or crawled toward a slow death months later.Can this year wrap things up in Utah on a high?The GalleristView image in fullscreenNatalie Portman and Jenna Ortega in The Gallerist.Photograph: MRC II Distribution Company LPAfter deservedly winning an Oscar for her all-consuming downfall in Black Swan,Natalie Portmancontinued to take risks many others of her ilk were too scared to take. Some worked out (Jackie, Annihilation, May December, Vox Lux) and some didn’t (Lucy in the Sky, Jane Got a Gun, Song to Song), and Portman, in more conformist mode, managed to also get lost in the Marvel machine, gaining paycheques but losing our interest. After Portman called out the Golden Globes for its lack of female directors in 2018 and then wore a name-studded cape to the 2020 Oscars to bring attention to sexist snubs, she was criticised for having made only two films directed by women. She held her hands up and said she would try harder and since then, she has stuck to it, starring in the muddled Apple TV series Lady in the Lake for Alma Har’el, and this year she has two films made by women set for release. Before we see her enjoy Good Sex for Lena Dunham, she’s leading The Gallerist from Cathy Yan, a dark Art Basel Miami-set satire which sees her play a, yep, gallerist who gets involved in a scheme involving the use of a dead body as art. It’s always a thrill to see Portman in non-superhero territory, and the supporting cast – Jenna Ortega, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Zach Galifianakis, Sterling K Brown, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Daniel Brühl, Charli xcx – is the most tantalising of the festival.The MomentThe year ofCharli xcxcinema is kicking off quite spectacularly with a Sundance that will see her feature in three major films. There are two small roles in the art satire The Gallerist and erotic drama I Want Your Sex and then there’s The Moment, her big debut as lead, playing an exaggerated version of herself in an absurdist pop mockumentary. It’s the star’s riposte to the many self-indulgent concert docs we’ve witnessed in recent years, imagining what could have happened if she had made different choices during the Brat summer of 2024. It’s a fun and unusual move from someone at her level of fame but also a risky one given how difficult it can be to nail this particular brand of satire (the star has referenced This Is Spinal Tap as key inspiration, the sequel to which recently crashed and burned …) Hit or miss, it’ll be one of the hottest tickets of the festival.Knife: The Attempted Murder of Salman RushdieView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Eliza GriffithsWhile narrative films have been far harder to rely upon in recent years, Sundance has become a more trustworthy home for documentaries. This week saw all five Oscar nominees for the best documentary come out of last year’s festival, and this month’s crop promises more hot button issues and big-name celebrity tell-alls. There’ll be docs revolving around figures such as Billie Jean King and Brittney Griner, but the one that’s gaining the most heat is Alex Gibney’s intimate look at Salman Rushdie and the horrifying attack he survived in 2022. Knife: The Attempted Murder of Salman Rushdie, based on Rushdie’s similarly titled memoir, will feature video footage shot by his wife, the novelist and poet Rachel Eliza Griffiths, and is set to give viewers more insight into what happened that day and his recovery in the months after. In a recentinterviewwith the Hollywood Reporter, Rushdie has said the film is not the true crime story he imagined it would be but rather “a love story” instead.BuddyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Worry Well ProductionsIt’s pretty much a given that the festival will feature a major horror breakout, with hits such as Get Out, Saw, The Babadook, Talk to Me and Hereditary all receiving Park City premieres in recent years. It’s just not always easy to guess which film it’s going to be. The past two years have seen major sales for It’s What’s Inside and Together ($17m a piece), two scary movies that scared audiences away upon release. The most buzz right now would seem to be surrounding Buddy, a mysterious midnight movie from the company behind Barbarian and Weapons. Little is known about the plot other than it follows a young girl and her friends having to escape from an evil version of a classic kids TV show and that early promo hype has called it “a new experience in horror”, whatever that may ultimately mean. It stars The Penguin’s Cristin Milioti alongside Michael Shannon, Patton Oswalt and Keegan-Michael Key, an intriguing cast that, along with a writer-director with Adult Swim sitcom experience, suggests a horror with prominent comedic elements.The Friend’s HouseIs HereView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sundance InstituteThere may not be another film at this year’s Sundance that feels quite as timely as The Friend’s House Is Here, both for its content and the issues surrounding its premiere. It’s a secretly shot film about the importance of artistic freedom in Iran, made as bombing took place last summer and premiering as the Khamenei regime makes life for Iranians harder than ever with no access to internet and violence inflicted on those daring to protest. It’s also making its debut as Trump’s travel ban has meant that its two female leads and many crew members are unable to make it to the US. As Jafar Panahi’s politically tinged thriller It Was Just an Accident enjoys two major Oscar nominations even as the film-maker is facing a prison sentence in Iran, this drama, about two women in Tehran who must protect each other after their creative circle is exposed, couldn’t feel more relevant.The AI Doc: Or How I Became an ApocaloptimistView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Focus FeaturesIt’s about that time for an AI doc boom, given how much it’s infecting our day-to-day, and this year’s Sundance has the origins doc Ghost in the Machine and then the far more high-profile offering The AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist. It’s the new film from Navalny’s Daniel Roher, co-directing with Charlie Tyrell, and boasts the Oscar winner Daniel Kwan, of Everything Everywhere All at Once, as producer. The film, which is getting a big push by Focus Features, was born from Roher’s desire to understand the risks and opportunities attached to AI as he prepares to become a father. Pre-release materials promise “a stark wake-up call that explores the existential dangers and extraordinary promise of this rapidly rising technology”.The History of ConcreteView image in fullscreenPhotograph: John WilsonJohn Wilson’s short-running yet much-adored HBO series How To With John Wilson, which was both memoir and essay and saw him document the lives of New Yorkers while giving advice, was so hard to define that he made his own meta-trailer focused around that very fact. His first feature is based around a similarly unusual idea: What if he used the knowledge learned at a workshop aimed at helping people write and sell a Hallmark movie to try to sell a documentary about concrete? It’s hard to know exactly what to expect from that but promo materials highlight the word “strange” but also “joyful”, so expect the unexpected. With Wilson’s ardent fanbase and with Josh Safdie as producer, expect this to be one of the most in-demand tickets of the festival.The InviteView image in fullscreenPhotograph: The InviteAfter she premiered her beautifully made yet bafflingly written thriller Don’t Worry Darling at Venice, one might be a little cautious about getting too excited about another Olivia Wilde-directed film getting a high-profile festival premiere. But the actor-director, who is also leading Gregg Araki’s erotic drama I Want Your Sex at Sundance, has a follow-up intriguing enough to have us curious at the very least. While her ambitious 50s-set sci-fi might have ultimately buckled under the weight of its own incoherence, The Invite is keeping things simple. Based on the Spanish comedy The People Upstairs, it follows an unhappily married couple who are invited to take part in an orgy by their neighbours. Wilde stars alongside Seth Rogen,Penélope Cruzand Edward Norton (the original cast was set to include Amy Adams, Paul Rudd and Tessa Thompson), and while the small cast and limited locations might make it seem like a classic lo-fi Sundance chamber piece, Wilde has reportedly shot it on 35mm with a team of collaborators (Yorgos Lanthimos’s longtime editor, Blood Orange on music, The Last Black Man in San Francisco’s skilled cinematographer) that suggests it will be that much more.The WeightView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Matteo Cocco2025 was a hell of a year for Ethan Hawke, leading a box office hit in Black Phone 2, a critically acclaimed new TV series in The Lowdown and scoring his fifth Oscar nomination for his exceptional performance in Blue Moon. He’s kicking off the new year with a return to Sundance (he has previously premiered films including Before Sunrise, Boyhood and Juliet, Naked at the fest), teaming up withRussell Crowe, who scored a surprise hit with last year’s second world war drama Nuremberg (the film reached over $46m at the global box office, more than many of this year’s Oscar contenders). In The Weight, from the TV director and editor Padraic McKinley, Hawke will play a struggling father in the 1930s who must smuggle gold in order to escape a brutal work camp. Crowe will again take on villain duties.AntiheroineView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Edward LovelaceOne of the more intriguing star-led docs at the festival promises an unfiltered look atCourtney Love, a star who has long been incapable of operating with any sort of filter. Antiheroine follows her after her 2019 move to London as she focuses on maintaining her sobriety and recording a new album. The film features contributions from names such as Michael Stipe and Billie Joe Armstrong and has been described as “raw, complicated, and deeply human”. It comes from the same production team behind documentaries on other famous women such as Pamela Anderson and Victoria Beckham. While it’s healthy to remain a little sceptical of celebrity docs which have been made with the subject’s input, Love is not a star one can imagine holding back.Explore more on these topicsSundance 2026Sundance film festivalFestivalsNatalie PortmanCharli xcxSeth RogenJenna OrtegafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Could this lead to alarming outcomes?Emine SanerThu 22 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTShareAt Stoke primary school in Coventry, there are many four-year-olds among those starting in reception class who can’t sit still, hold a pencil or speak more than a four-word sentence. Lucy Fox, the assistant headteacher and head of foundations, is in no doubt what is causing this: their early exposure to screens, and a lot of it. When the children experiment with materials and creativity, and make things in the classroom, she says, “We notice a lot of children will cut pieces of cardboard out and make a mobile phone or tablet, or an Xbox controller. That’s what they know.”At another school in Hampshire, a longtime reception teacher says in the last few years she has noticed children getting frustrated if activities aren’t instant and seamless – something she thinks comes from playing games on a phone or tablet. There is a lack of creativity and problem-solving skills, noticeable when the children are playing with Lego or doing jigsaw puzzles and turning the pieces to fit. “I find their hand-eye coordination isn’t very good, and they find puzzles difficult. Doing a puzzle on an iPad, you just need to hold and move it on the screen. They get really frustrated and I feel like there are certain connections the brain is not making any more.”There is also something of an attitude shift, she says – a kind of individualism that she’s convinced comes from playing alone on a device. “We are having to model to children how to be with others, how you work as a team, how you share things, because they’re so used to having their own time, doing their own thing. We’re losing a big part of being human, and if these young children don’t get all those skills, they’re not going to pick them up later on.”View image in fullscreenCreative play is crucial for brain development.Photograph: Posed by models; PeopleImages/Getty Images/iStockphotoEarlier this month, the government announced it would beissuing new guidanceon screen use for under-fives in April, after a report it commissioned found 98% of two-year-olds were watching screens on a typical day, with the average duration more than two hours. Those who spent the most time – around five hours – had limited vocabulary compared with those who spent the least, and were twice as likely to show signs of emotional and behavioural difficulties.“It’s a trend that we’ve been seeing for quite a long time,” says Pasco Fearon, a professor of developmental psychopathology at University College London and the director of theChildren of the 2020sstudy. “Look at studies getting all the way back to the turn of the century – you can see that screen time, on the whole, has been increasing.” That’s true for all of us, not just for children. Of the impact on children, Fearon says: “I’m sure it’s a factor that a lot of parents, like the rest of us, are on their phones. It’s becoming very dominant in everyone’s lives.” The data in this study, he says, “can be quite a useful focal point to start thinking: Wait, is this what we want? A little bit of a reset might be useful for everyone.”This report comes on the back of other recent research showing very young children’s screen access is increasing. In October, the Americanresearch organisation Pewfound that 38% of parents of under-twos said their child uses or interacts with a smartphone, and 8% of under-fives had their own smartphone. In the UK, Ofcom’s research has found that19% of children aged three to fivehad their own mobile phone in 2024, and that37% of children this age– more than 800,000 kids – were using at least one social media app, up from 29% in 2023 (though the majority use it with their parents’ supervision).Young people, parents and teachers in the UK: share your views on the proposed social media ban for under-16sRead moreThe Conservatives have justpledged to follow Australiaand ban social media for under-16s, and the Labour government has said it will consider doing the same. (Australia’s ban, incidentally, includes YouTube but not YouTube Kids, which is aimed at younger viewers – so it does not necessarily address the problem of excess screen time.)Unlike for teenagers, little research has been done on the impact of social media on the youngest children. At the extreme end, all children are at risk of sexual abuse online. In November last year, the NSPCC reportedonline grooming crimes had reached record highs, with the youngest victim being just four.More is becoming known about the impact of young children exposed to excessive screen time, though. In 2025,a New Zealand studyfound that young children who had watched more than 90 minutes a day had below-average vocabulary, communication and numeracy at the ages of four and eight, and that more screen time meant even poorer outcomes.TodayKindred Squared, an organisation that campaigns for early years education and development, releases its latest report on children’s school readiness. It found that more than half of teachers believed spending too much time on screens – by children and their parents alike – was the single biggest factor contributingto the child not being ready to start school. “We know that screen time is a problem,” says the CEO, Felicity Gillespie. This year, reception teachers reported 28% of children were unable to use a book correctly, for instance tapping or swiping the pages as if it were an electronic device.“In cases of higher usage,” says Gillespie, “there is a real negative impact on language acquisition. It’s not that surprising when you think about how language is developed in babies, that it is through that serve-and-return interaction with adults – the baby makes a noise, the parent makes a noise back. The baby smiles, the parent smiles. It’s that two-way interaction that fires the baby’s brain. Nought to two is the period when our brains are growing at their fastest rate, so the earlier you put babies in front of screens, the more they are missing out [on] those early interactions, which is where the hard-wiring of the brain is happening.”The early years, says Gillespie, “are the foundation for everything that follows, for mental and physical health, wellbeing, your happiness, your success in relationships. I think it comes back to this need for better information for parents and clear, simple, unequivocal guidance. Tell them the truth. Tell them what the evidence says.”The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends children under two should get no screen time at all, and for those aged two to four, a maximum of one hour. Is that realistic in today’s parenting world? Gillespie acknowledges the latest study showing two-year-olds are watching two hours a day. “Then what we then need to do is give parents the information about why the WHO advises that, to inform people about the preciousness of these early years and the importance of brain development.” The government, she hopes, will “give parents the kind of practical, real-world guidance that takes account of the fact that, I think, we’ve probably missed the boat on the WHO guidance”.View image in fullscreenCovid forced many parents to rely on screen-based entertainment.Photograph: Posed by models; Giselleflissak/Getty ImagesThe Covid pandemic accelerated screen use (many children in current reception classes and year 1 were born in that first year), but it had been steadily rising before that. “My referrals have been increasing over the past 10 years,” says Sandy Chappell, an early years speech and language therapist. During the lockdowns, she says, it was “not just that children were isolated from other children, but also that parents were relying more on screens to pacify young children. I had many parents in impossible situations, where they were trying to work from home and had babies and toddlers to entertain at the same time, so they had no choice but to rely on screens.”She has sympathy for parents who rely on screens now. “Absolutely. It’s unbelievably difficult.” Fearon too, talking about the research that is driving the government’s advice, stresses it’s not about blaming parents. The study found children from disadvantaged families were more likely to spend time on screens. “This is about understanding the context in which this is happening, and how people are making the day work when there are challenges families are experiencing, financially, and in terms of work and all the pressures of daily life. If we’re trying to support families, it’s partly about giving them really clear advice, but also about giving more help to families, particularly those who are experiencing economic disadvantage. That’s going to give them a bit more slack to be able to play more, talk to their children more, be more engaged in the way that they’d like to.”In Chappell’s clinic, she is seeing children with “poor attention and listening skills, poor turn-taking and social skills, as well as poor vocabulary and expressive language”. Many have their own electronic devices, and although Chappell has seen the stats about social media use, it’s not something she’s aware of. “Parents don’t tend to tell me that’s what’s happening, because I think instinctively they know it’s not a good thing.” And while some content is better than others – “things like [the BBC’s] CBeebies, where [many programmes are developed with] educational value by psychologists and educationists” – what matters more is duration. “We really need to cut the time down,” says Chappell.She can spot the children who have spent a lot of time on screens: she has seen preschoolers, she says, who will spend seven or eight hours a day on a screen. Other children might be shy to begin with, but will soon start talking to her or will go straight to investigate her toy collection. Those who have spent a lot of time on screens, she says, don’t tend to interact with her and “don’t seem to be particularly interested in toys. They can’t follow simple instructions. They’re wandering around the room – and I’m not talking about young toddlers here, but three- and four-year-olds. They start school without even the basic skills that they need in order to be able to learn.”This is often when the child is referred to her, with parents worrying they’re not ready for school. “Preschool children can catch up to a certain extent if the screens are reduced to a bare minimum and time is spent on building other skills. It becomes more difficult once they get to school, and we are finding that these issues are following children right through school. Their language levels at age four are one of the biggest predictors of their later academic achievement at GCSE level and beyond. So it really is important that we put the work in with children way before they go to school.”View image in fullscreen‘Children are used to doing their own thing.’Photograph: Posed by model; Caia Image/Getty ImagesBy the time they join reception, many children will already be familiar with a tablet, and in 2025, for the first time, children used a touchscreen device to take the 20-minute test known as thereception baseline assessment. “There were children who couldn’t speak a sentence who did very well in the assessment, because they could scroll,” says Fox, sounding exasperated. “It became not an assessment of what children academically could do, and where they were developmentally, but an assessment of how computer-literate they were – and that’s what horrified me.”To accommodate 60 reception children, but without space within the school, Stoke Primary turned a wooden “roundhouse” (a simple octagonal wooden structure), which had been in their forest school area, into a new classroom, complete with rugs, fairy lights and, inadvertently, no wifi – and therefore no screens. At first, as Fox wrote in TES (formerly the Times Educational Supplement), this seemed an “inconvenience” and a “hurdle”. It ended up transforming her thinking on screens in schools; her previous job had been in a school which prided itself on giving each child an iPad.My analogue month: would ditching my smartphone make me healthier, happier – or more stressed?Read more“Very quickly we realised the impact that it was having on the children,” says Fox now. By the end of that first autumn term, 72% of the “roundhouse” children were considered to be “on track” compared with 44% of the children in the traditional classroom. When they switched the classes later in the year, they got similar results.The roundhouse style, in which children sit in a circle, “forces communication and language to come before anything, which is so important. We have quite a significant amount of English as an additional language compared with other schools – 60% of our children in reception last year – so the language skills that it’s pulling out of them is remarkable.” Instead of the usual schemes, or structured lesson plans that use PowerPoint and other software, “there is none of that in the roundhouse. It forces you to go back to basics. I had to build up the confidence of those teachers to feel they could do that, and could make their own decisions about what they knew was best for their children. We all know that we live in a digital age, and there is no stopping digital growth. But to what extent are we using tech to replace the things that we know are best for our children?” Both reception classes no longer use screens for teaching, though the older classes do.Fox is turning her attention to the newest generation of teachers coming through. “They’re from a different generation,” she says – people who have grown up with screens themselves. “How can we give them the confidence to know what’s best, and to put the scheme down and just connect with their children?”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Adding a few extra steps to your routine to hydrate and repair can help, as could some carefully chosen swaps if your skin is particularly parched or irritated.Whatever your winter beauty gripe, here are 24 products, tried and loved by me – including many products I rely on daily – or enthusiastically recommended by the Filter team and our beauty columnist, Sali Hughes. Most are affordable; if not, they’re worth their weight in gold to warrant the splurge.The best cold-weather beauty productsSkincareView image in fullscreenKeatsmoisturisingcream, 50ml£29 at Keats BeautyFounded by Lucinda Hart, previously a developer atBeautyPie and Huda Beauty, Keats launched last summer with just two products focused on hydration, housed in chic, genderless packaging. The ceramide and phyto-lipid moisturiser really packs a punch, while being gentle enough for sensitive and reactive skin types. I wiped my first pot clean in record time – I couldn’t get enough of the cream’s rich and silky texture, which feels comforting yet is still easily absorbed.View image in fullscreenAlpha-H vitamin B serum with 5% niacinamide, 25ml£49.99 at Cult Beauty£49.99 at LookfantasticThis bright blue serum is on the pricier side, but you only need a drop or two in your morning routine to feel the benefits, making it one of my go-to winter serums. With niacinamide and panthenol, it’s hydrating and helps to support barrier function too. I like the light, easily absorbed formula and the smooth texture.View image in fullscreenMimétique Skin Cloud cleansing balm, 100ml£44 at Space NKFrench brand Mimétique has gained a lot of attention for its simple, effective formulas this year. Sali Hughessings the praises of its cleansing balmfor being thorough and fast at removing makeup without leaving any residue. Suitable for sensitive skin types, it has a soothing balm-to-milk formula that’s ideal for winter.View image in fullscreenHerbarthe Sun Shield SPF30€42 (about £36) at HerbarSPF is still a necessity for protecting skin against UVA rays in the winter and it acts as a final layer of defence against the elements. If you don’t want anything that feels too heavy or creamy on top of a winter moisturiser, this Herbar formula is perfect and sits brilliantly under makeup. I’ve been using it since the start of the season and have been impressed by how light it is for a mineral formula. It leaves no white cast – just a lovely glowy finish.For more, read Sali Hughes’s guide tothe best SPFView image in fullscreenLa Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5, 40ml£8.80 at Lookfantastic£11 at BootsIf you have irritated skin or a compromised barrier, you can trust this repairing La Roche-Posay balm formula. Multiple dermatologists have recommended it to me. Mahto says: “It contains 5% panthenol and centella, which soothe irritation and stimulate cell recovery. It acts a bit like a liquid plaster in that it seals the skin to create an optimal environment for healing.” Try using it like a mask overnight for fast results.View image in fullscreenCeraVe Advanced Repair ointment,50ml£11.50 at Boots£12 at NoliThis is my favourite solution if I have dry, flaky skin around the nose and mouth after a cold, or rough bits on anything from knuckles and elbows to lips. It creates a comforting shield, protecting skin from any aggravation from the elements and locking in moisture. Meanwhile, hyaluronic acid hydrates and is combined with ceramides to lock in moisture and help repair the skin barrier. It’s also perfectly sized for chucking in your handbag.View image in fullscreenWeleda Skin Food,30ml£7.13 at Lookfantastic£6.72 at AmazonWeleda’s Skin Food is a beauty editor favourite. This low-cost moisturiser for super dry skin (it was also rated one of thebest hand creamsin our recent test) is glow-giving and feels cosseting, thanks to the protecting and soothing sunflower seed oil and calendula. It’s another product I keep in my cabinet for when bitter winds and icy temperatures have irritated exposed skin, though I wouldn’t recommend applying it to the face if you’re spot-prone, as the highly occlusive formula may clog pores.For more, see our guide tothe best hand creams for dry and chapped skinView image in fullscreenByoma brightening toner, 150ml£11.99 at Boots£11.99 at SephoraIf your skin looks lacklustre and dull but you’re wary of toning with actives that could irritate the skin in these climes, Byoma’s formula is a smart choice. Alongside lactic acid to smooth, it contains glycerine and ceramides to comfort. It’s one of Sali Hughes’srepeat recommendations.View image in fullscreenThe Inkey List Plumping Tripeptide lip balm, 10ml£8.80 at Lookfantastic£7.60 at AmazonI hate waxy or sticky textures on my lips in the daytime, so the Inkey List’s smooth, clear formula is my handbag essential – imparting moisture and a plumping effect without irritation. A godsend when the cold, dry weather seems to suck the volume out of your pout.For more, read our guide to thebest lip balmsView image in fullscreenShark CryoGlow LED mask£299.99 at John Lewis£299.99 at BootsJanuary is a good time to start a new routine with an LED mask–red light can help combat dryskin and boost radiance. There’s also promising research on red light and near-infrared’s potential ability to boost mood by stimulating serotonin and dopamine production – an upshot on dark days. The right one for you depends on what results you want to see. Shark’s CryoGlow mask comes highly recommended by the Filter’s testing. It has 160 LED bulbs with good facial coverage, and offers three different wavelengths of light: blue, red and infrared.For more, read our roundup ofthe best LED face masksView image in fullscreenThe Inkey List Caffeine eye cream, 15ml£6.95 at Lookfantastic£9.95 at SephoraIf your sleep routine has been sent awry by cold nights, dark mornings and general malaise, puffy eyes and dark circles have likely followed. Providing a hit of caffeine to the undereye area and keeping it well hydrated, the Inkey List’s light squalane and Matrixyl 3000 formula is my favourite budget eye cream (and was also rated best budget eye cream in theFilter’s tests).For more, see our guide tothe best eye creamsMakeupView image in fullscreenNars the Multiple, 14g£28.05 at Lookfantastic£33 at Space NKIf your skin feels dull, nothing puts a little extra colour in the cheeks (or lips, or eyelids) like the Nars Multiple. Cream blushes are more hydrating than powders, and the recent reformulation of this cult product is fantastic – it’s long-lasting and easy to blend. There are plenty of shades to choose from, though I like Sinful.View image in fullscreenChantecaille Lip Sheer,2g£34 at John Lewis£34 at Cult BeautyIf you’re after something with pigment, Chantecaille’s glossy, hydrating balm-lipstick hybrid comes in subtle and flattering shades. It’s not remotely sticky and doesn’t cling or highlight any dryness on cold-weather-addled lips. I’m sad to have worn my latest one down to a stub in the recent cold snap.View image in fullscreenErborian CC Creme,40ml£38 at Lookfantastic£38 at Space NKAnother one of my beauty ride or dies, which has added benefits for uneven winter skin tone, is Erborian’s CC Creme. The hydrating original formula is SPF 30, creamy yet light in texture and buildable, so you can pay extra attention to red areas to achieve a luminous, even finish. It’s non-comedogenic and suitable for sensitive or spot-prone skin.Bath and body careView image in fullscreenNaturiumthe Smoother body wash, 500ml£19 at Boots£18.76 at AmazonI added this Naturium wash to my shower ritual this winter and have been thoroughly enjoying it. It’s creamy and conditioning while gently exfoliating with AHAs and glycolic acid. So if, like me, you find that KP (keratosis pilaris) bumps can worsen in winter – because the skin gets drier from low humidity and cold air – then using this a few times a week will aid in smoothing skin.View image in fullscreenJones Road body scrub, 118ml£36 at Jones RoadBobbi Brown’s Jones Road beauty line is lauded for its smart formulas for mature skin, and I was excited to try her new body-care line. The exfoliator has fast become a new favourite, with such a silky, fine texture for this type of product. It makes my skin feel nourished while gently sloughing away dead skin and prepping it for a heavier winter moisturiser.View image in fullscreenThree Warriors exfoliating glove£11.99 at Face the Future£11.99 at CosmetifyI use the Jones Road body scrub with the Three Warriors exfoliating glove because I like how it does the job while being gentle on parched winter skin. I also appreciate the black colour, given that white mitts can look grubby very quickly when used with products.View image in fullscreenAkt the Everyday Encore body oil, 100ml£35 at Akt£35 at AmazonI’m not usually a fan of body oils, but this dry oil by British brand Akt in the orange grove scent has fast become part of my body care rotation; it smells divine thanks to the bergamot and neroli botanicals. It’s easily absorbed and gives skin an instant glow. Perfect for an uplifting home-spa moment before bed.Hair careView image in fullscreenGisou Honey gloss ceramide therapy hair mask,75ml£22 at Gisou£22 at Space NKIf your long hair is feeling parched and has lost its softness, Gisou’s rich mask is a great weekly treatment with a skincare-inspired formula of ceramides and hyaluronic acid to provide a major moisture hit to mid-lengths and ends. It doesn’t feel overly heavy upon application, and the nourishing addition of mirsalehi honey gives it a lovely scent without being overpowering.For more, check out our roundup of the best hair masksView image in fullscreenLarry KingClean As a Whistle scalp scrub, 50ml£14.40 at Cult Beauty£18 at John LewisIf your hair is looking more oily or dull than usual, a weekly scalp treatment will help to detoxify and remove product and oil buildup. I’ve tried a lot of scrubs, and my favourite is Larry King’s Clean As a Whistle formula with pink Himalayan salt and coconut oil. It feels gentle, lathers nicely and leaves hair shiny, moisturised and squeaky clean.View image in fullscreenColor Wow Dream Coat Supernaturalspray,200ml£27 at Lookfantastic£27 at AmazonLike armour for the hair, Color Wow’s heat protectant is one of my most bought beauty products of all time. Whether the problem is hair tools, constant drizzle or central heating, the treatment spray creates a shield that keeps it looking sleek and helps it stay protected. It’s heat-activated, so use it pre-blow-dry by spritzing generously on sectioned hair, root to tip. It’s a hairdresser favourite for a reason.View image in fullscreenDyson Airwrap idmulti-styler£399 at John Lewis£479.99 at SephoraIf you want to invest in a hair tool, I highly recommend the Dyson Airwrap id. The newest model’s clever app can be programmed according to your hair type and texture to create and set waves, and its six lightweight attachments are all designed to dry the hair while protecting shine, strength and moisture. It uses clever tech to keep the airflow temperature below the damaging threshold of 150C, a bonus in winter when hair can be fragile.It’s a big money buy but is on offer atJohn Lewisright now – and if, like me, a bouncy blow-dry makes you feel instantly more put-together, then it’s the most user-friendly tool out there for getting one at home.For more, see our roundup ofthe best hot brushesNails & feetView image in fullscreenManicurist Active Glow polish, 15ml£16 at Lookfantastic£16 at AmazonManicurist’s Active Glow is a brilliant multitasker if your nails are weak or prone to flaking or breaking in cold weather. It moisturises while adding instant strength and a healthy-looking, sheer coat of colour. I like the Blueberry shade and apply it weekly to bare nails.View image in fullscreenDr Glycolic Soft Feetpeel socks£3.90 for members at Beauty PieBeauty Pie’s sock-shaped pouches are filled with glycolic and lactic acid as well as nourishing coconut and fruit extracts, so they moisturise as well as remove dead skin. Try not to be alarmed by the snake-like peeling for several days after the 90-minute treatment. Your feet will emerge baby-soft and ready for spring.What you need to knowHow to create a winter skincare routineLook for ingredients that mimic your skin’s protective barrier. Specifically, says consultant dermatologist Dr Anjali Mahto, “ceramides are essential – they act as the mortar holding your skin cells together and are often the first thing to be depleted by cold wind”. You can also find them in hair products. “Squalane is also excellent,” Mahto adds. “It’s a biomimetic oil (similar to human sebum) that prevents moisture loss without feeling heavy or clogging pores.”While vitamin B5 and niacinamide can help calm inflammation and maintain barrier function, there’s a possibility that your barrier may be compromised right now. The signs will be clear: redness, stinging upon application of your usual products, and a tight feeling, even after applying moisturiser. If so, stop using any harsh actives (think retinoids and BHAs), anything containing perfume, and strip back your routine to the basics until your skin is calmer and happier.It’s worth bearing in mind that while hyaluronic acid is a hugely popular humectant (meaning it works by drawing moisture to itself), in dry, centrally heated rooms, it can draw moisture to the surface and evaporate. So ensure you lock it in with an occlusive layer, such as one containing ceramides, or try an alternative ingredient such as glycerine. “It’s fantastic, often overlooked and tends to be more robust in lower humidity,” notes Mahto. Ectoin is also a much-hyped humectant skincare ingredient to look out for.How to look after your hair in winterYou’re not alone if your locks look inexplicably greasy at this time of year. Hats are one of the biggest culprits, says Issey Cook, hair stylist at Larry King salons. “They press oil flat against the scalp, which can make hair more greasy as there’s no ventilation. Also, the cold air and dry heating combination can make the scalp dehydrated, which our skin responds to by producing more sebum.” Focus on deep cleaning the scalp and restoring moisture, as well as creating a barrier from the elements when styling.For more:The best hand creams to soften dry and chapped skinThe best body moisturisers for silky smooth, hydrated skin – testedThe best lip balms to protect your lipsHayley Spencer is a journalist and editor with 15 years of experience in writing on topics spanning style, beauty and wellnessExplore more on these topicsBeautyThe FilterSkincareHair careHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But now the favourite is back, piled with new toppings, sold by new companies and promoted all over social media by potato influencersSammy GecsoylerThu 22 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShareThey were once a lunch option that inspired little excitement – but the jacket potato’s time has finally come. After decades in epicurean exile, the humble spud has made a roaring comeback in the UK and piqued the interest of foodies across the world. A-listers, tourists and trend-hopping teenagers are queueing for hours to get their hands on them. For Jacob Nelson, who sells loaded spuds that have gone super-viral on social media, this was all part of the plan. “We thought: how can we make the jacket potato sexy again?” he says.The 30-year-old, who runsSpudBroswith his brother Harley and dad Tony, was among the first crop of social-media savvy spud vendors to give the jacket potato a much-needed makeover. After a slow start in lockdown, the brothers spoke to some youngsters in Preston Flag Market, where they had set up shop, to find out why they were shunning spuds. “It was an absolute ghost town,” says Harley. “We spoke to one student walking past us. He said to get on social media.” The pair listened, filming their interactions with customers while showing off their mouthwatering loaded spuds, and subsequently went stratospheric on TikTok in 2023.View image in fullscreenJacob and Harley Nelson, the founders of SpudBros.Photograph: Garry Cook/AlamyNow, they have nearly 5 million followers on TikTok, nabbed asponsorship dealwith Preston North End FC, and have teamed up with celebrities includingWill Smith,Liam NeesonandMr Beastto show off their spuds. “It’s just crazy,” says Jacob. Their success is part of a spud renaissance. One of the world’s oldest street foods,yaki imo, for example, has been sold on the streets of Japan since the 1600s. So the rebirth of jacket potatoes is a reinvention for modern times.View image in fullscreenAn image of baked potatoes being sold on the streets of London, c. 1840.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesJacket potatoes have been a popular dish in the UK for nearly 200 years. One of thefirst recorded mentionswas in the SpudBros’s Lancashire hometown Preston Guardian in 1846, but they really took off in the mid-19th century when, according to Victorian historian Henry Mayhew, about 10 tons of jacket potatoes were sold each day, mainly to labourers, in food markets across London. They remained popular in the 20th century, becoming a cafe staple on high streets across Britain before waning in popularity.Now, it seems, they’re on the up again. According toa poll commissioned by Subway, which entered the spud game itself last year, 94% of UK adults say they eat a jacket potato once a week. The number of jacket potato businesses is also soaring: in 2023, just seven food-related businesses with the word “spud” were opened in the UK. In 2024, this shot up to more than 40 and, last year, it passed 70. The number of people seeking to cook a jacket potato at home is also rising: by the end of 2025, sales of large potatoes were up by a third at Waitrose compared with the year before, whilesearches for “jacket potato” on Waitrose.com were up 178%.View image in fullscreen‘Potato Queen’ Poppy O’Toole.Photograph: Ellis ParrinderDespite not being terribly photogenic, spuds are also going great guns on social media, sparking transatlantic debates and catapulting potato-influencers to culinary stardom. In 2024, Americans went viral aftersharing their horrorover the British love of a loaded potato stacked with tunaandbaked beans. Meanwhile,Poppy O’Toole, who is known for championing the humble spud by sharing the many ways they can be roasted, mashed and fried, has amassed nearly 5 million TikTok followers and published five cookbooks. Even Kim Kardashian hasprofessedher love for a potato topped with sour cream, butter and bacon bits.So, are spuds worth the renewed enthusiasm? I headed to SpudBros Express in Soho, central London, to give one a go. Plastered outside the shop is a bold declaration: “The Greatest Spuds on Earth.” This permanent space is a snazzy upgrade from their market tram, a little like a Wonka factory for potatoes, with sacks of spuds sitting in one corner, fancy cast-iron potato ovens roasting away, and a production line of workers dishing out tasty ’taters at speed. There are five set options, including “cheese, beans and chewna [tuna] mayo” and “garlic chilli chicken”, both coming in at £10.50, but I went for another popular option: the chilli con carne-based Spudfather (also £10.50).View image in fullscreenSammy Gecsoyler with his SpudBros Express bounty.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianI watched as the potato handler prepared the base: one and a half King Edward spuds, a generous swig of melted garlic butter, a rather alarming amount of cheese and chilli con carne, topped with crispy onions, sour cream and SpudBros’ signature “spicy tram” sauce (a sort of spicy mayonnaise). The box was hefty (mine weighed nearly 1kg) and I let it sit for five minutes, everything melting together. By the time I opened it, the sour cream seemed to have cooled the now slightly congealed spud. Digging in was harder than you might imagine using a fiddly wooden fork, but each bite was a real treat – the spuddy mix was silky smooth and the chilli was packed with flavour. Could I finish it? Absolutely not; I could barely manage half.The next day, I went for the garlic chilli chicken spud, which came topped with lashings of garlic butter and cheese, followed by chicken curry, fresh chilli, crispy onions and a cooling raita. I was really excited for this one (it sounded delicious) but sadly the curry tasted as if it had been made in a hurry (or batch-cooked), with the onions needing a bit more browning. The spices lacked depth and the raita, which contained grated cucumbers, along with the slightly underdone onions, gave the dish a less than desirable crunch.By the time I had eaten my fill, it was midday and the lunchtime queue was in full swing. According to 21-year-old shift leader Alfie Thompson, this was nothing compared with peak season: “Over Christmas, we were selling over 400 potatoes a day.” When he joined the team about a year ago, there were “queues all the way down the street”, he says. As people monitor their spending post-Christmas, Thompson says things have quietened down, though the usual stream of customers continue to trickle through.View image in fullscreenClockwise from left: the Spudfather; tuna mayo; and garlic chilli chicken jacket potatoes at SpudBros.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianAmong those waiting were many teenagers and tourists who had flocked to SpudBros after seeing the business’s videos on social media. But they’re not the only potato fans: 38-year-old Toby Jamison, from London, was “never really a fan of jacket potatoes” growing up but says he has been inspired by the newest crop of social media spud pioneers (which includes Tamworth-based vendorSpudMan, who has more than 4 million TikTok followers). “When you realise there’s so much more than the standard options,” says Jamison, “it really opens things up.” Especially if, like him, you “don’t like tuna and cheese, or coleslaw”.Now that my spud standards had been raised, I had another stop to make: Subway. Since the sandwich shop began selling jacket potatoes last year, the reaction has been mixed. Some social media users have complained ofcold spudsandbland fillings(apart from baked beans, they consist of their regular sandwich toppings) and, when I ventured inside, I wasn’t filled with much confidence.The potatoes are on display behind the glass counter, cold. They’re popped in an oven for a couple of minutes then cut open for filling. I asked for extra olives, sweetcorn and peppers on top, to beef up the portion, which is much smaller than SpudBros’. The end result was still uninspiring: the ’taters, which cost almost £7 each, were placed into a white box with some of the vegetables sliding off the watery beans and grey tuna.But of course, it’s really all about the taste. It wasn’t terrible – but it felt like a throwback to the sad, bland offerings you might have tolerated in the school canteen. And, despite my hope that the spud skins would crisp up in the oven, they remained limp and slightly chewy. SpudBros Express 1, Subway 0.View image in fullscreenQueen Camilla with TikTok star Spudman, at Clarence House in London.Photograph: MediaPunch Inc/AlamyIt’s not all just about the spectacle of social media, where lavish, calorie-dense toppings take centre stage. Dr Joanne Lunn, health and nutrition lead at Waitrose, attributes the booming interest in jacket potatoes to a “growing awareness of ultra-processed food”. So, are they healthy? Broadly, yes. They are low calorie and contain a variety of important nutrients, including iron and potassium. That said, the “size of the potato is really important”, says nutritionist Jo Travers. She recommends going for a spud “the size of your fist” because eating a potato that is too large “can spike your blood sugar and then crash it”, which can lead to feeling fatigue. She also notes that potatoes don’t contain a great deal of fibre and that, to turn them into a more complete meal, fibre- and protein-rich toppings are key. “Beans are perfect and chilli is great. It gives us fibre, protein and also micronutrients like iron. Tuna is another great option because of how much protein it contains,” she says.The dramatic turnaround for the jacket potato comes at an interesting time. In 2024, baked potato specialist Spudulike shut its doors in the UK after gracing high streets for nearly 50 years, despite a last-ditchattempt by chef James Martin to revamp the menu(his makeover included a new arsenal of toppings such as butter chicken, peri peri wings and a ratherlarge and fully intacthotdog).The basic benefit of a jacket potato is that it allows you to have something as healthy or as luxurious as you wantAccording to food industry expert Jane Milton, big brands are often too slow to hop on top of culinary trends and make the most of sudden social media popularity. “When I was at school, there were potato shops on every high street,” says Milton. Now, she says, they are back again but in a “slightly different” way – instead of undercooked potatoes sprinkled with meagre amounts of cheese, we’re seeing mountains of melted cheddar, oozing melted butter and colourful topping combos including crispy onions, bright and punchy sauces, and fresh herbs such as coriander and chives. “There’s a lot of excitement and theatre about what they’re doing,” says Milton. Both SpudBros and SpudMan wear headcams to film their encounters with customers. There has also been some questionable experimentation with toppings – in a 2024 sponsorship with Mecca Bingo, SpudMan gave out ’taters loaded with lobster, caviar, and gold leaf at bingo halls in Blackpool and Stevenage – that have attracted interest, if nothing else.At a time whenthe food industry is strugglingunder the weight of soaring bills and staffing costs, jacket potatoes are also a more economic option for shops and stalls. “There is definitely a good margin and a relatively low amount of skill needed,” says Milton, who calls them a “good bet”. According to Milton, the main piece of kit required is a potato oven (which can cook up to 200 spuds in 90 minutes), and staffing requirements are minimal. “If you’re in a place that has high footfall, you could very easily turn out a couple of hundred spuds over a lunch break,” she says.View image in fullscreenOne for the ages … a perfect jacket potato.Photograph: JohnGollop/Getty Images/iStockphotoJacket potatoes are also increasingly being sold as takeaway items, which means “you’re not having to pay to clean up somewhere or do the dishes”, says Milton. They’re also great for avoiding costly food waste; unlike sandwiches, “you’re not making loads in advance and hoping they’ll sell”. King Edwards (the most common choice for a crispy and fluffy potato) hold well and the various toppings are kept separate until the point of sale.“The basic benefit of a jacket potato is that it allows you to have something as healthy or as luxurious as you want,” says Milton. “It’s a good blank canvas.”As for the SpudBros, they are hoping to take this British staple around the world. “We could become a global brand,” says Harley. “It’s something we’ve dreamed about.”Explore more on these topicsFoodPotatoesRestaurantsFast foodTikTokSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then came more alarming rumours: the dunder pits had overflowed.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Dunder pit? This is the one of the most distinctive features of traditional Jamaican rum, a style exemplified by Hampden, which has been in operation since 1753. You typically make rum by fermenting molasses and/or sugar cane juice into an alcoholic “wash”, then distil that into a potent liquor, but local distillers developed several strategies to oomph up the flavour. Dunder is the leftover liquid from the still, and it’s lobbed into the next fermentation for its funky notes, a bit like a sourdough starter. At Hampden, they also use muck, an outrageously smelly, semi-sentient soup containing countless billions of yeast bacteria, plus various bits of decomposing, well,stuff. I’m not sure what would happen if you fell in: possibly die, or perhaps be granted infinite powers,Obelix-style. Then there’s the fermentation process itself: most distilleries use generic industrial yeasts, which typically convert sugars to alcohol over a couple of days, but at Hampden they harness wild yeasts, which can take weeks. Incidentally, Andrew Hussey, Hampden’s owner, has reported that production is now safe, though the communities who live and work around the distillery remain badly affected.We’ve heard a lot about the miraculous powers of fermented foods such as kimchi and kefir, and I’m not going to pretend that Jamaican rum will do anything for your microbiome, but these tiny universes of microbes do have miraculous effects on flavour, giving Jamaican rum its distinctive, bassy funk, orhogo. Hampden’s signature 1753 blend, for instance, has rich tropical fruit, deep baking aromas, nail varnish, glue, Marmite, leather, spice, animal spirits. Try it neat or in a Kingston negroni, for which it’s subbed in for the usual gin.Rum has boomed in recent years, and really why wouldn’t it? It’s approachable and mixable, less up itself than scotch or cognac, and has the most interesting history, too. Alas, however, it is more “spiced rum” that has gained favour with British drinkers – a generic, sweetened spirit mixed with aggressive vanilla, much of it fit only for knocking back pre-amputation. Hampden however, exemplifies a welcome counter-trend in the Caribbean for distilleries to lean on their own distinctive rum-making traditions and produce liquids that are as much an expression of place as wine is. That hasn’t always been a given, thanks to the vagaries of colonialism and its illegitimate heir, capitalism.Jamaica is synonymous with rum, but for decades most of its rum was sold in bulk to exporters and blended and aged in Europe. However, since it gained a Geographical Indication for rum in 2016, local producers have been working hard to make Jamaican rum Jamaican again. The oldest surviving distillery,Appleton Estate(1749!) was the first to employ a Jamaican female master blender, the redoubtableJoy Spence, and now ages all of its rums on the island, which concentrates those tropical flavours. Then there isWorthy Parkin the south, where they have revived sugar cane production to make a rum that is truly an expression of its locale. You could equally do far worse thanWray & Nephew, the iconic overproof white rum that is far and away the most popular on the island itself, and makes an evil daiquiri; 90% of Jamaicans cannot be wrong.Four Jamaican classicsHampden Estate 1753£57.25 (700ml; on offer) The Whisky Exchange, 46%. An outrageous liquid: like tropical fruit, spice and kerosene put through a subwoofer. Shines through just about any mixer.Appleton 8-Year Old Reserve Blend£28 (700ml) Majestic,43%. One of the best-value spirits around. Banana, apricot, toffee, funk. Great in a rum old fashioned.Worthy Park Single Estate Reserve£46.95 (700ml) Master of Malt, 45%. Unlike most rum producers, Worthy Park grows its own sugar cane. This is a lovely rum, rich in mango, butter and tobacco.Wray & Nephew Overproof£31 (700ml) Tesco, 63%.

Seasonal colds and lurgies abound. The weather is generally at its rain-lashed and blackly overcast worst. Well-intentioned attempts at self-improvement or abstemiousness are starting to creak in the face of a desire for whatever scraps of midwinter comfort we can find.Nowhere is this more apparent than when it comes to food and, more specifically, the daily puzzle of how to have something nourishing as a working lunch. These can feel like lean days in more ways than one – characterised by tax payments or a painfully slow creep towards the first payday of 2026. And that’s only more apparent now that, after the remote working and pyjama-clad Zoom calls of the post-pandemic era, lots of us have returned to the office for at least the bulk of the week. Even as someone who effectively eats out for a living, there have been plenty of times when I have stood up from the desk of my chosen workspace (often one of the oversubscribed tables at the British Library) with no real plan and wandered aimlessly, only to end up forking out for some insipid sandwich, tepid heat-lamp soup or tray of indeterminate vegetable mulch that is both expensive and unsatisfying.The answer, for a healthier bank balance and general disposition, is to come prepared and embrace the primped packed lunch. This, of course, is where gutsy, smartly constructed winter salads come into play. Not a dismal punishment tub of undressed baby spinach and slimy sweet potato chunks. But, rather, punchy, textural riots such as Nigel Slater’ssmoked mackerel and bean affair, Georgia Levy’s loose method forcold soba noodles and shaved, crunchy vegcloaked in a tahini and sesame dressing, or Rosie Birkett’sceleriac, apple and lentil salad, brightened by lemony mayonnaise and an enlivening lick of dijon mustard.View image in fullscreenTasty goodness … Rukmini Iyer’s chapati omelette rolls.Photograph: Ola O Smit/The GuardianElsewhere, Rukmini Iyer’schapati omelette rollsare a simple, hugely satisfying alternative to a sandwich, seemingly built for the age of healthful protein-maxxing. Bento boxes also often feature delectable, soy sauce-enriched folds of egg – and are like dopamine-boosting activity centres for adults. Caroline Craig and Sophie Missing’sapproachable bento-building guidedeftly simplifies what can feel like a fiddly process. Through a different cultural lens, Peter Gordon’sbacon, pea and shallot muffinsmake a similar case for hearty cooked items that are just as enjoyable at room temperature, having been entombed in a lunchbox for a few hours. Have access to a kettle? Well, you could do worse than construct Tamal Ray’s veg-filled, rainbow-hued riff on everyone’s favourite additive-stuffed hangover salve:the noodle pot.These days, it is possible to have something hot for an office lunch without having to subject the rest of the kitchenette to the powerful scent of microwaved mulligatawny. Invest in an insulated flask, as I have, and you can slip off to a quiet spot for a private moment with something warming. Yotam Ottolenghi’ssour lentil soup, a version of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’schicken and winter veg brothrolled over from a Sunday roast, or a rice dish – Akwasi Brenya-Mensa’splant-based dirty Cajun rice, maybe – that will retain its heat and hold your interest to the last, scraped spoonful.The first month of 2026 is almost done, and it may well be that the promised equine momentum of the Year of the Horse is yet to fully materialise for you. All the more reason to make time for a lunch that soothes, coddles and surprises.My week in foodView image in fullscreenFood storytelling at its finest … Cannon by Lee Lai.Composite: Bee Elton/Girmondo PublishingGraphic gastronomy|A melding of food and literary graphic fiction is a combination basically lab-engineered for my particular cultural sensibilities.

Some, such as Jeanne Carola Francesconi’s epic 1965 La Cucina Napoletana, were reprints of established books, while others were specially commissioned for the series. There is considerable variation; some of the 20 regions occupy 650 densely filled pages, sometimes spread over two volumes, while other regions have 236 pages with larger fonts, with everything in between. All of which is great, although I can’t help feeling affectionate towards the regions with 14-point font.In the face of the vast variation of regional culinary habits, knowledge and rituals, I also feel affectionate towards the common traditions; those that are specific to a place, but at the same time that cross local and national borders, as well as for the stories of the ingredients. Takepasta e fagioli, for which beans are boiled in water with fat, maybe fragrant herbs and vegetables, then pasta is added for a dense dish that probably needs a spoon. Almost all regions (and towns and individuals) have a version that is both extremely general, and specific – white beans, potato, no rosemary in Lazio, say; lardo, sage and plenty of rosemary in Piedmont; nutmeg, bread and pasta in Liguria; lardo, marjoram, tomato and chilli in Abruzzo – inviting a sort of pick and mix. And the embracing of new ideas, too, because cooking is a living, evolving thing.Cesare Battisti, head chef and owner ofRatanà in Milan, is great on all this, noting that: “It’s true that we need to be custodians of tradition, but we also need to have a little courage to desecrate it a little, and in an intelligent way, but we have to do it.” It is with these words that he suggests a pasta e fagioli that follows a familiar pattern – soaked beans added to a soffritto, followed by water, then pasta – but then also takes inspiration from Thailand and includes coconut cream, spring onion, chilli and optional lemon.We were delighted by the contents of our steaming bowls, and especially the addition of that coconut cream, which softens the colour to taupe and makes the dish feel luxurious while remaining fresh. I agree with Battisti when he suggests it must be hot with chilli, but, of course, you decide. The same applies to the lemon (“ingrediente inaspettato”,or unexpected ingredient), which turns the dish around like a bright spark.I will leave the last word to Battisti: “Questi piatti non sono da discutere, sono da provare, dovete provare a rifarli, provate.”Which is to say: these aren’t dishes to discuss, these are dishes to be tried. Although you could also try, then discuss.Pasta e fagioli with coconut, spring onion, chilli and lemonServes4200g dried borlotti beans, soaked overnight in plenty of cold water5 tbsp olive oil3 spring onions, white bulbs diced, green parts thinly sliced1 stickcelery, diced1 small carrot, peeled and diced1 fresh red chilli, sliced2 sprigs fresh rosemary, 1 picked and minced, the other left whole2-3 tbspcoconut cream200gtagliatelle, roughly broken upJuice of1lemon(optional)Drain and rinse the soaked beans. Put the olive oil, spring onion whites, celery, carrot, half the red chilli, and all the rosemary in a heavy-based pan and cook on a medium-low heat, stirring, until the vegetables start to soften and turn translucent. Add the soaked beans, one and a half litres of fresh water and a pinch of salt, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for an hour, or until the beans are soft.Remove half the soup, blend it smooth, then return to the pan with the coconut cream and salt to taste. Put the pan back on the heat and bring to a lively simmer. Add the broken tagliatelle and simmer, stirring regularly, until the pasta is cooked – you might need to add a bit more water.Serve, topping each bowl with the sliced spring onion greens and a little extra chopped red chilli, and encouraging those who want to add a squeeze of lemon.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkPastaBeans, pulses and legumesVegetablesThai food and drinkMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

Just total darkness, the sound of gentle dripping and a creeping feeling of unease. The switch is flicked back on and the shadowy world that lies deep beneath the Karst returns. I’m in Vilenica, thought to bethe first cave in the world ever opened to tourists, with records of visitors dating back to 1633. It’s a magical sight: a grand antechamber sculpted through erosion, filled with soaring stalagmites and plunging stalactites streaked in shades of red, terracotta and orange by iron oxide, and dotted with shimmering crystals.Vilenica is just one of a network of thousands of caves located in the Karst region of western Slovenia and eastern Italy, which is known for its porous, soluble limestone rock. Above ground, this creates a distinctive landscape, filled with rocks bearing lined striations and pockmarked by hollows known as dolines, where the limestone has collapsed underneath. But below ground is where it’s really special, with enormous caves, sinkholes and subterranean rivers. Later in the day, I visit the region’s other main visitor cave, Škocjan, where I’m amazed to see an underground river thunder through a chamber almost 150 metres high. It’s an almost surreal sensory experience, with the rush of the rapids echoing around the walls.Slovenia and ItalyAs my guide drives me through the Karst region, I watch the undulating hills of a comparatively untouched stretch of countryside go by, dotted with a patchwork of bilingual villages connecting eastern Italy and western Slovenia along a border that shifted several times over the 20th century. Increasingly, the area is viewing itself as one region spanning two countries, and is hoping to combat the overtourism plaguing Italy and Slovenia’s better-known destinations by attracting people in search of a slower, more authentic and local experience. To showcase its shared history, nature and culture, the region has established a new EU-funded cross-border geopark, known asGeoKarst, and is hoping to secure Unesco designation.View image in fullscreenTypical Karst region countryside around the Škocjan cave.Photograph: robertharding/AlamyWinding around the region’s hills, I reach its highlight – Štanjel, a medieval village that wouldn’t look out of place in Provence, but without the crowds. Wandering around its cobbled streets feels like stepping back a millennium, or in some cases longer, given the village has prehistoric and Roman origins. The flint-grey buildings are made of sturdy local Karst stone, which has stayed more or less intact for hundreds of years. At sunset, I sit with a glass of crisp local vitovska wine inBistro Grad, a prettily decorated restaurant garlanded with dried flowers, and take in sweeping views of the gilded valley beneath.It's a distinctive landscape, filled with rocks bearing lined striations and pockmarked by hollows  where the limestone has collapsedLeaving Slovenia, we venture over to the Karst’s Italian side, where it is flanked byTrieste, a vibrant university city that blends Italian culture with Viennese art nouveau architecture courtesy of its lengthy stint as the Austro-Hungarian empire’s sole port. Locals say the cultural blend has given it a uniquely open-minded and tolerant spirit. My guide, Beatriz Barovina, tells me that unlike elsewhere in Italy, you can eat, sip an espresso or drink a glass of wine alone without being judged for not having a big Italian family around you. She says there is still a strong attachment to Austria, especially among older generations, who cling to the refrain: “It was better under Austria.”View image in fullscreenThe hilltop village of Štanjel.Photograph: Natalia Schuchardt/AlamyLocals tell me that as well as the buzzy cafe culture, they love Trieste for its easy access to nature. Heading out of the city centre for 15 minutes, we reach the 3-mile Via Napoleonica route, which offers panoramic views of Trieste’s bay, and connects the small towns of Opicina and Prosecco, birthplace of the eponymous sparkling wine.A place at the farmer’s table on a foodie trip to TriesteRead moreIt’s easy to eat well in the Karst region because most produce is sourced from local farmers. One unique experience is a visit to a localosmice, family-run farms and vineyards. AtCantina Parovel, the family serve homemade cheese, wine, prosciutto, honey and olive oil on picnic tables shaded by pines. The Parovel family is proud to boast its distinctively Karst pedigree to me: three generations of the family were born in the same village, yet their grandparents were born in the Austro-Hungarian empire, the parents in Italy, and the children in Slovenia.Theirosmiceis located at the end of a spectacular 4-mile hike through the Rosandra valley, if you start in the village of Mihele and partly follow stage 36 of theAlpe Adria Trail, cutting through a landscape of wild cherry trees and roe deer. If you’re lucky you might even stumble upon one of the improvised “wine caves” – hollows in which people leave local wines and cheeses on an honesty-bar basis for hungry and thirsty travellers – with carved wooden seating overlooking the valley below.It’s a uniquely Karst experience, and one that reflects the region’s two most distinctive features: its striking landscape and welcoming, communitarian spirit.The trip was provided byPromo Turismo FVG, the tourist board of Friuli-VeneziaGiulia, andVisit Krasin Slovenia.

Taylor says it’s an avoidance tactic. You decide who’s out of tuneFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonThu 22 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 11.54 ESTShareThe prosecution: TaylorHe will throw in lines from songs during serious conversations – it is an avoidance tacticI’ve been married to Randy for 33 years and we have four kids. We have a great marriage, but there are still things we need to work out. Namely, whenever we try to have a serious discussion, Randy will start singing song lyrics. It drives me nuts.Randy knows a lyric for every occasion, and always has something in his back pocket to suit the moment. I find it impressive, but it can also get irritating. If we’re not having a serious conversation, then a lyric or two doesn’t matter, but if we are, it becomes annoying. Sometimes it lightens the moment, but more often it ruins the vibe.He does it less often now, but I’d love him to stop doing it completelyIt is true that, of the two of us, I get annoyed more easily. Maybe that’s because I’m a Scorpio, or because I’m better at communication. I’m 53 now, and over our 33 years of marriage, Randy has learned the importance of communicating more frequently, and uses fewer lyrics, but I’d love him to stop doing it completely. Ten years ago, he wouldn’t have listened to me at all when I asked him to stop. He’s improved a lot, but things still need work.We are both quite chilled and don’t argue much. When we were going through a rocky patch, we went to therapy, and it’s helped Randy develop more self-awareness. I really appreciate that. But sometimes he will still chuck in a lyric during a serious conversation and I will have to call him out.I think it’s an avoidance tactic. Boys are taught not to cry from a young age and I think Randy bottled up his feelings when he was growing up. But we’ve learned to support each other. A friend who’s been married for 60 years once said, when asked why they and their partner had never broken up: “It’s because we never fell out of love at the same time.” It’s like that between Randy and me: whenever one of us pulls away, the other pulls them back in. We’ve come such a long way together – it would be great if we could just iron out this last issue in our relationship.The defence: RandyYes I should tone it down, but a lyric can lighten the mood and there’s one for every occasionTruth be told, when things get too serious, I have a tendency to deflect. I love music and I love listening to song lyrics. I always seem to have the right lyric for every situation. I have a really good memory, and whenever Taylor and I have a conversation, I have a habit of quoting whatever lyric is in my head at the time.You be the judge – send us your domestic disputesRead moreIt’s become a reflex; I do it without thinking. If Taylor’s mentioned losing an item, or a co-worker leaving, I’ll defer to the band Cinderella and say you “don’t know what you got till it’s gone”. Don’t Stop Believin’ by Journey has a lot of lyrics that can be applied to any number of life situations, too. Sometimes she gets annoyed at me for doing this, but I think it can help lighten the mood when things get difficult.Taylor and I have been in therapy together, and it’s taught me a lot: I now know when to double down on my habit to help lift the mood, or when to stop quoting and switch to serious mode. We’ve been together for so long that I’m now able to read her quite well.I’m from the south of the US, where men don’t talk about their feelings. Now, after counselling, I understand her moreI know I do this because I don’t like to go too deep into things: replying to Taylor using lyrics helps me to avoid facing an issue head-on. We’ve got a lot better with our communication. I used to speak in lyrics a lot more, especially when we were talking about difficult things, but our marriage counselling really helped us. It’s changed how we communicate.I used to leave the room when a conversation was too difficult, or just make jokes, but now I can withstand it. I was against therapy for a while as I’m from the south of the US, where the idea of a masculine man is one who is strong and silent. But I was still bothered by things – I just wasn’t able to discuss them with Taylor, and then it would build up.Now, after six months of counselling and 33 years of marriage, I understand her moods a bit more. I don’t quote lyrics as much because I know she hates it. But I think it’s sometimes necessary as it helps to change a bad situation into a good one.The jury of Guardian readersShould Randystop waxing lyrical?Surely by now Randy can see that his constant recitation of song lyrics is a barrier to communication. Taylor must have the patience of a saint. Stop hiding your feelings and speak plainly, Randy.Kate, 33Randy needs to stop this nonsense. Taylor wants Randy’s attention, not a jukebox reflex. It’s a shield for Randy, and that’s probably why they’re having so many arguments. To put it in a way that Randy understands: “Stop right now, thank you very much. I need somebody with a human touch.”Peter, 62Taylor should “shake it off”, as her namesake sings. This sounds like a wonderful marriage where both parties have worked to compromise and communicate differently. The haters are gonna hate, but Randy doesn’t miss a beat. And this song quotation business is harder than it looks.Leanne, 37It’s important in any relationship to find whimsy and joy in a partner’s quirks, but Taylor is clearly irritated by this one. While it is admirable that Randy has addressed his deflection through lyricism, his persistence suggests unresolved avoidance that still needs work for a healthier marriage.Phoebe, 25Taylor’s annoyance is understandable – willingness to open up about feelings is so important in a relationship. However, it sounds as though Randy is working on this. Taylor could be more accepting of the habit when the conversation is less serious.Lily, 41Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us who you think is making a song and dance out of thisThe poll closes on Wednesday 28 January at 9am GMTLast week’s resultsWe asked ifGeorgia should pay the fineafter her mum gave her a lift to the airport but didn’t pay the drop-off charge.75%of you said yes –Georgia is guilty25%of you said no –Georgia isinnocentExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Based on its cobbled floors, mullioned windows and the ancient crest above its door, you might expect it to be a kitschy, Ye-Olde-Scottish-themed pub trading off its historic significance and obvious Instagrammability. But that’s never been the vibe. During my time as a regular in the late 00s, there was something alternative about it (or “moshery”, as its detractors would put it): they often played heavy metal, punk and emo; the walls were adorned with vintage records, and many of the bar staff had tattoos and piercings. The atmosphere was far closer to a dive bar than a folksy tourist trap. But Stirling is too small a city for a venue to cater exclusively to any one type of person, and the clientele is still, as it was then, a merry blend of students, tourists and locals of all ages who often end up chatting to one another before the night is over.View image in fullscreen‘Far closer to a dive bar than a folksy tourist trap’ … Nicky-Tams.Photograph: Elizabeth Leyden/AlamyNicky-Tams was my first pub, the place I drank as a teenager, a time of your life when you can be as obnoxious as you want while downing cider at the park or in a friend’s empty house: you can stagger around, burst into tears, hoot and holler, squawk along to My Chemical Romance, and unless the police are called or someone’s parents show up, nobody is going to tell you off. Drinking in a pub marked the beginning of a more mature stage in my life, an education in how to socialise.Those early nights taught me that my right to have a good time did not supersede the right of other people to not be annoyed. I learned to be affable and polite to those around me. That’s not to suggest that my friends and I became the image of adult sophistication, sipping dry martinis as we traded sparkling bon mots and penetrating insights about current affairs or the music of John Coltrane. I’ve no doubt we were still boorish, but far less so than we would have been if left to our own devices, unchecked by the civilising influence of tuts and glares.The great thing about Nicky-Tams was that when thingsdiddescend into raucousness, this tended to be collective and cross-generational. During my first Christmas back home after leaving for university, I remember the whole upstairs room singing itself hoarse to Fairytale of New York. Young and old, locals and tourists, people welled up, put their arms around each other and danced on the tables. It remains to this day my platonic ideal of a fun time at the pub. As well as making me marginally less annoying, Nicky-Tams instilled in me a lifelong, impassioned belief in the importance of conviviality, chatting to strangers and hearty good cheer.Explore more on these topicsPubsThe pub that changed meAlcoholfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For furious guests, this is a cost-cutting measure too farThu 22 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShareName:Hotel bathroom doors.Age:Solid doors have existedsince ancient Egypt.Appearance:Increasingly flimsy, possibly nonexistent.Hang on, I’ve been in many hotel bathrooms in my life and I can tell you they all shared one characteristic: a door.Well, no longer.The Wall Street Journalhas exposed the terrifying slide towards extinction of proper, solid, closing doors for hotel bathrooms. They are being replaced with “sliding barn doors, curtains, strategically placed walls and other replacements”.“Sliding barn doors” – what are we, animals, forced to do our business for all to see?It gets worse. “Some hotels have been moving the sink and shower into the bedroom and enclosing the toilet in glass or placing it in cubby-like space,” according to Bjorn Hanson of New York University’s Jonathan M Tisch Center of Hospitality.Nothing says romantic mini-break like struggling to defecate quietly in a glass boxas your beloved turns on the TVand tries desperately to dissociate.Yep. “This door is designed to either move your relationship forward or end it,” as thecomedian Becca Herries put it, standing in front of a flimsy sliding number. “You couldn’t see the fine details, but you could see everything else,” a victim of a frosted glass door told the Journal, chillingly. “I love my husband but I don’t want to see him use the restroom.”View image in fullscreen‘Sliding barn doors’ are on the increase.Photograph: FG Trade Latin/Getty ImagesEven worse if you’re sharing with a colleague. I assume this outrage is a cost-cutting measure?As the Journal explains: “In the eyes of a chief financial officer, the humble door can look like a money pit.” Proper bathrooms with doors require the costly likes of lightbulb changes and door handle maintenance.I bet chief financial officers have toilet doors in their houses.Of course, but whither shareholder value?But surely it’s a false economy – won’t guestsvote with their feet (and other body parts)?Not all of them. “If the toilet is in the middle of the room, I don’t really care,” one nihilistic hotel guest said.Each to their own, I suppose. But the door people must fight their corner.Don’t worry, they already are. TheBring Back Doorswebsite is a crowdsourced database of door heroes and villains. It gives a privacy rating and door description for hotels in various cities, from “confirmed bathroom door” to the dread “Zero privacy: no door, no wall, or wall with a window”.And who’s behind this vital public service?Sadie Lowell, a digital marketer, who bears the psychic scars of a hotel trip with her father in 2024 where the pair shared a room with no bathroom door. “Suddenly I wasn’t just mildly inconvenienced as I had been in previous no-door situations,” Lowell writes on the site. “I was angry.”Do say:“I’ve booked us a sexy bargain hotel break, babe!

We recognise that the current child sponsorship model reflects a different time.”ActionAid’s supporters sponsor children in 30 countries, with the money providing 34% of the charity’s global funds, according to Ghazi.Ghazi said: “We’re in the process, until 2028, of transformation that includes our systems, what money we give, how we procure services - we’re decolonising it.“We are evolving the model so it is shaped by community voices and responds to the realities they face today,” adds Bond. “We value our sponsors and remain committed to making sure their support continues to have a real impact.“Meaningful change takes time, and this work is rooted in genuine commitment rather than lip service.”View image in fullscreenThe charity is hoping to establish a fund specifically for women’s rights groups that are under attack as a result of the global anti-rights movement.Photograph: Misper Apawu/ActionAidAs a method of fundraising, the process of allowing donors to choose between children to support has been likened to“poverty porn” that perpetuates racist attitudes, leading to calls for it to be phased out.Charities vary in how they spend the money raised through child sponsorship; some use the funds to support the child directly, while others spend it on projects that support the child’s community. The charities often provide the sponsors with regular updates and the opportunity to exchange letters with them.Save the Children, a pioneer of the fundraising method from when the charity was founded in 1919, ended its child sponsorship programme last year. It said it was not suitable for modern contexts and was also expensive because money that could have been spent on projects had to be used to facilitate the exchange of letters between donors and the sponsored children.AI-generated ‘poverty porn’ fake images being used by aid agenciesRead moreBond and Ghazi’s vision for ActionAid’s future sees it as a feminist, anti-racist organisation that focuses more on fundraising through partnerships with civil society groups. One way that could work would be to encourage groups of friends or family members to form “sisterhoods” where they collectively raised money that would go towards women’s rights groups in a developing country.They also aim to provide long-term funding to grassroots groups that give those on the ground more power over how they spend it, and are planning to launch a fund specifically for women’s rights groups that are under attack as a result of theglobal anti-rights movement.“ActionAid’s future is about solidarity, justice and how we can really drive forward change,” said Bond. “The world is in a bad place and we have a really important role as a global federation in pushing back on the levels of injustice that are happening all over the world.”Themrise Khan, an independent researcher on the aid sector, said the practice of marketing mostly African children to a western audience should be abandoned altogether.“The entire concept is highly problematic and racist in its overtones and shrieks ‘white saviourism’,” said Khan. “Nothing should replace it.“Better education, state welfare systems and healthcare should be the model – all responsibilities of a nation state. Not: ‘sponsor a poor African/Asian child at x dollars a month’ to make you feel good about a child you have never even seen in person, and may never see other than in a picture on your refrigerator.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentAidHumanitarian responseCharitiesCharitable givingFeminismAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A Senate vote on a similar resolution was also tied last week until JD Vance broke the deadlock.US Senate kills resolution that would have limited Trump action in VenezuelaRead moreTo defeat the Democratic-backed resolution on Thursday, Republican leaders had to hold the vote open for more than 20 minutes while Republican congressman Wesley Hunt, who had been out of Washington all week campaigning for a Senate seat in Texas, rushed back to Capitol Hill to cast the decisive vote.On the House floor, Democrats responded with shouts that Republican leaders were violating the chamber’s procedural rules. Two Republicans –Don Bacon of Nebraska and Thomas Massie of Kentucky – voted with all Democrats for the legislation.The war powers resolution would have directed Trump to remove US troops from Venezuela. TheTrump administrationtold senators last week that there are no US troops on the ground in Venezuela and committed to obtaining congressional approval before launching major military operations there.But Democrats argued that the resolution is necessary after US troops captured the Venezuelan president,Nicolás Maduro, in a surprise nighttime raid earlier this month that left Congress in the dark.Thursday’s vote was the latest test in Congress of how much leeway Republicans will give a president who campaigned on removing the US from foreign entanglements but has increasingly reached for military options to impose his will. So far, almost all Republicans have declined to put checks on Trump through the war powers votes.Brian Mast, the Republican chair of the House armed services committee, accused Democrats of bringing the war powers resolution to a vote out of “spite” for Trump.Still, Democrats stridently argued that Congress needs to assert its role in determining when the president can use wartime powers. They have been able to force a series of votes in both the House and Senate as Trump, in recent months, ramped up his campaign against Maduro and set his sights on other conflicts overseas.“Donald Trump is reducing the United States to a regional bully with fewer allies and more enemies,” Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House foreign affairs committee, said during a floor debate.Last week, Senate Republicans wereonly able to narrowly dismissthe Venezuela war powers resolution after the Trump administration persuaded two Republicans to back away from their earlier support.Trump’s recent military actions – and threats to do more – have reignited a decades-old debate in Congress over the War Powers Act, which dates back to the Vietnam war era.Trump’s insistence that the US will possessGreenlandover the objections of Denmark, a Nato ally, has alarmed some Republicans on Capitol Hill. They have mounted some of the most outspoken objections to almost anything the president has done since taking office.Trump this week backed away from military and tariff threats against European allies as he announced that his administration was working with Nato on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security.But Bacon still expressed frustration with Trump’s aggressive foreign policy and voted for the war powers resolution even though it only applies toVenezuela.“I’m tired of all the threats,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHouse of RepresentativesTrump administrationVenezuelaMike JohnsonDonald TrumpAmericasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Dubbed the ‘Carney Doctrine’, the Davosspeech lamented the disintegration of rules-basedorder amid a rise of “great powers” that used economic “coercion” as a weapon.But his Thursday speech on the grounds of a famed citadel, built to fend off a potential American invasion, nonetheless laid out a defence of Canadian values and his vision for where the country fit into a rapidly changing world.Trump claims Nato troops ‘stayed a little off the frontlines’ in AfghanistanRead more“Canada cannot solve all the world’s problems, but we can show that another way is possible: that the arc of history isn’t destined to be warped towards authoritarianism and exclusion, it can still bend towards progress and justice,” he said.Carney’s remarks, largely written by the prime minister himself, included a jab at US president Donald Trump,who suggested earlier in the weekCanada was insufficiently “grateful” for the state of its economy, which he said was the result of American generosity.“Canada lives because of the United States,” Trump told attenders in Davos. “Remember that, Mark, next time you make your statements.”View image in fullscreenCarney also took time to pose with Bonhomme Carnaval, mascot of the Quebec Winter Carnival.Photograph: Mathieu Belanger/ReutersCarney said the two countries “have built a remarkable partnership” through their integrated economies, security agreements and shared values. But he also added: “Canada doesn’t live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian. We are masters of our home. This is our country.”Despite international approval for his blunt assessment of the “rupture” in the geopolitical order, Carney has faced pushback from opposition Conservatives, who say the prime minister’s recent trade missions to China and Qatar have produced little concrete investment and distracted him from domestic challenges.Carney pledged to move “fairly and fast” to speed up major infrastructure projects and to tackle the sustained cost-of-living crisis plaguing the country. But he also faces the prospect of two sovereignty referendums in Alberta and Quebec.“When we are united, unity grows. When we are Canadian – inclusive, fair, ambitious – Canada grows,” he said.Europe must heed Mark Carney – and embrace a painful emancipation from the US | Paul TaylorRead moreThe prime minister did acknowledge the country’s history was defined by a move “slowly, imperfectly, not without struggle” towards cooperation and partnership of the disparate groups that called it home. Canada has not always lived up to its stated ideals, he said, including the sustained “dispossession” of Indigenous peoples and the “violation” of treaties – a reality that persists into the present.After giving his speech, Carneymet- and hugged– the giant novelty snowman Bonhomme, who serves as the ambassador of the city’s winter carnival.Carney is in Quebec to meet with cabinet and attend briefings before parliament returns on Monday.

Since then, however, Trump has positioned it as a global body tasked with resolving international conflicts of all stripes, and to bechairedby Trump himself, in what appears to be part of the administration’s latest effort to reshapethe postwarglobal order.Several Europeancountries have saidthat they will not join the board, some expressing concerns that the initiative could seek to sideline or replace the UN.Speaking in Davos on Wednesday, Trump suggested that the “board of peace”, which requires countriesto pay $1bnin cash to become a permanent member, would“work with”the UN to end global conflict.View image in fullscreenThe official emblem of the United Nations is seen at the United Nations headquarters in New York City, New York on  23 August 2022.Photograph: David Dee Delgado/Reuters“Once this board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do, and we’ll do it in conjunction with theUnited Nations,” Trump said.Onsocial media, however, people were quick to notice that board of peace’s new logo resembles the UN one, with both including a globe with olive branches on each side. Where the UN logo shows a map of the whole world, however, Trump’s shows only North America and some parts of South America, such as Venezuela, where he has attempted to assert US control.The color, too, is different: the UN’s neutral blue contrasts with the board of peace’s bright gold, an aesthetic consistent with Trump’s personal style. Last year he added what he called “Trump touches”to the Oval Office, installing gold trimming across the ceiling, door frames and fireplace, as well as gold trophies and vases, and even gold drinks coasters bearing his own name.Annotated picture sowing who was at the 'board of peace' unveilingAt the time, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, described it as a “golden office for the golden age”, and a spokesperson insisted the gold was “of the highest quality” and was paid for personally by Trump. It was alsoreportedthat he enlisted his“gold guy”, as one of Trump’s advisers described him – a cabinet maker from Florida who has worked on Mar-a-Lago and Trump’s Palm Beach club.Trump even installed anew signreading “Oval Office” in cursive gold script that appeared to be printed on paper and stuck to the wall.The US president’s obsession with gold has extended beyond just decor. In June, the Trump Organization unveiled a mobile phone service and $499gold smartphoneand in December, he announced the$1m “gold card”visa for wealthy foreigners. Foreign leaders have leaned in: in February, it was reported that Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, gave Trump a“golden pager”– an apparent reference to Israel’s 2024 deadly attack against Hezbollah in Lebanon – and in August the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, gifted Trump an engraved glass disk with a base that theWashington Postreported was made from 24-karat gold. In November, meanwhile, a group of Swiss billionairesgavehim a gold Rolex desk clock and a $130,000 engraved gold bar – after which Trumpagreed to slash tariffson Switzerland from 39% to 15%.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpDavosUnited NationsUS politicsAmericasUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Federal rules prohibit the cockpit jumpseats from being used for leisure travel.It is unclear how Pokornik was able to convince the airlines he was employed as a flight attendant years after he stopped working in the industry.Typically, employees use a card linked to a database that has their photo and confirms they are an airline employee, according to a flight attendant at a major Canadian airline. Staff must show a government-issued identification and an employee badge. Rules are looser, however, if the person identifying as an airline employee is flying for leisure.Pokornik who was indicted on 2 October, was later arrested in Panama and extradited to the United States. The Department of Justice said the Department of Homeland Security is investigating the case along the US Marshals Service.If convicted, Pokornik faces up to 20 years in prison, and a fine of up to US$250,000.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAir transportAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Twenty animals, including 19 belugas, have died at the park since 2019, according to a tally by the Canadian Press.Marineland, which is closed to visitors and wants to sell off its land, shocked the public last year – afterits China proposal was rejected– saying that it was running out of resources to care for its 30 whales and might euthanize them.A fisheries ministry spokesperson, Ira Khedkar, told AFP in a statement on Thursday that Marineland representatives met with the government on Wednesday.“The minister [Joanne Thompson] was presented with new export permit applications. The minister will review them expeditiously,” Khedkar said.Phil Demers, a former trainer turned whistleblower at the reportedly bankrupt Marineland, told AFP the park wants to sell the belugas to several institutions in the United States.The Canadian Press also reported on Thursday that Marineland wants to sell the animals to a series of US parks.Marineland did not immediately reply to a query about a CP report that the park has prepared a euthanasia plan and intends to kill its whales if its US export proposal is rejected.Thompson has said she rejected Marineland’s 2025 request to sell the whales to the Chimelong Ocean Kingdom theme park in China because thatwould have perpetuated the whales’ exploitation.The ministry did not comment on the specifics of Marineland’s latest proposal.Marineland has said all the beluga deaths at the park have resulted from natural causes, but animal welfare officials from the province of Ontario have been investigating the park for five years.Explore more on these topicsCanadaWhalesAmericasMarine lifeWildlifeCetaceansnewsShareReuse this content"

But will she survive another milestone?Read moreShe said she remained open to the possibility of another reconciliation with Littleproud and the Nationals. Senior Liberal sources described Ley’s leadership as all but over on Thursday, after a the secondCoalitionsplit in eight months, sparked by a dispute on Labor’s hate speech laws.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“My focus is always on the Australian people, so I just want to say the door is not closed, but my eye is not on the door,” Ley said.“My eye is on the work that my team has already done over summer in holding the government to account on expenses scandals, on Bondi, dragging, kicking and screaming to a royal commission … ”In another interview, Ley was asked if she was worried about a challenge from Hastie or Taylor, both conservatives. She said they were “strong, committed members of my team”.The former Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, told Guardian Australia it was unfortunate Littleproud had called the Coalition “untenable” under Ley this week.He said he hoped the two parties would reconcile “sooner rather than later”.McCormack, a former deputy prime minister, helped reunite the Liberals and Nationals after their short-lived split in May last year and has been a supporter of Littleproud’s leadership.“I think it’s unfortunate that a comment of that magnitude was made,” he said.“TheLiberal partyleadership is a matter entirely for the Liberal party and I would never suggest anything about a Liberal party leader.”Littleproud dug in on Friday, continuing to blame Ley for the split, and claiming he had tried to “avert it”.The Nationals leader said it was not up to him to determine who the Liberal leader is, despite his comments yesterday that he would not work with Ley.The split followed Nationals senators Bridget McKenzie, Susan McDonald and Ross Cadell crossing the floor to vote on Tuesday, breaking with the Coalition’s position on the laws drafted after the Bondi terror attack.Littleproud, who had warned Ley accepting resignations from the trio would spark a walkout by the Nationals, said the party’s door is “open”.“What I said is that we couldn’t serve in Sussan Ley’s ministry after she accepted the resignation of three senators that shouldn’t have been accepted. There was an avenue not to,” he said.Ley’s deputy, the shadow treasurer Ted O’Brien, said he expected her to remain leader.“I know there’s a lot of commentary on this … yes, she will,” O’Brien told ABC radio.The Coalition has collapsed, will Ley’s leadership? - podcastRead more“I support the Coalition coming back together, because it is in the national interest. It is the only way that we can get the nation going back in the right direction.“But you don’t just form a Coalition without any commitments. There has to be a rock-solid commitment to work together as one team.”Firebrand conservative senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, who moved from the Nationals party room to the Liberals after the election, continued to criticise Ley’s leadership.“I made it very clear that obviously the leader had lost trust in me, lost faith in me, and I suppose I felt the same at the time,” she told Sky News on Thursday night.“I don’t feel like things have improved.”Some Liberals say a challenge is more likely to take place when MPs return to Canberra in the first week of February. A special meeting to consider a leadership spill can be heldif two MPs petition the party whip for a vote.Explore more on these topicsCoalitionLiberal partySussan LeyDavid LittleproudAngus TaylorAndrew HastieNational partynewsShareReuse this content"

It seems like everyone is just waiting for America to cool down on this topic, hoping it will pass away. But what if it [does] not: what then?”Might is right: US ‘foreign policy’ held hostage to mad king Trump’s whimsRead moreSome European leaders have echoed those sentiments, with Poland’s Donald Tusk calling Greenland an “unneeded” distraction from Russia’s war in Ukraine and efforts to disrupt Europe.Ireland’s Micheál Martin said European leaders “cannot lose focus on the situation in Ukraine”, calling the situation “desperate”, but crediting the US with a “critical” role in achieving “a just and fair and sustainable peace in Ukraine”.Zelenskyy said: “Sending 14 or 40 soldiers to Greenland– what is that meant to achieve? What message does that send to Putin? To China? And perhaps, most importantly, what message does it send to Denmark?”During his speech, he suggested Ukraine could help defend Europe in the event of a Russian invasion of Greenland, saying: “We know what to do if Russian warships go near Greenland, Ukraine can help with that. They can sink near Greenland just as they do near Crimea.”Zelenskyy said Europe should play a more muscular role in targeting Russia’s “shadow fleet” of oil tankers, which help bankroll its war machine, and said it remained too easy for Russia to bypass sanctions and to continue mass-producing missiles and other ordnance.The threats to Europe were existential forNato, he said, and Europe needed a “united armed forces” that could defend the continent.“Today, Europe relies only on the belief that if danger comes, then Nato will react. But no one has really seen the alliance in action. If Putin decides to take Lithuania or strike Poland, who will respond? Right now, Nato exists thanks to the belief that the United States will act … but what if it doesn’t?”View image in fullscreenSteve Witkoff in Davos.Photograph: Gian Ehrenzeller/APZelenskyy delivered his speech shortly after he met Trump to discuss stalled talks for a peace deal to end Russia’s war in Ukraine.Trump told reporters that his meeting with Zelenskyy was “good” but that there was “a ways to go”. Witkoff, who met Putin later on Thursday, said the fact that the meeting was called by the Russians was a good sign.“I think we’ve got it down to one issue and we have discussed iterations of that issue, and that means it’s solvable,” Witkoff said before flying to Moscow. He was joined by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.Trump, when asked atDavoswhether he had a message for Putin, said: “The war has to end.”Putin greeted the Americans shortly before midnight in Moscow. Minutes after the talks began, Russia said it had carried out a patrol of strategic bomber planes – something it regularly does as a show of strength and deterrence.The defence ministry said the Tu-22M3 bombers – part of a long-range fleet that Russia has used throughout the war to fire missiles at Ukrainian cities, military targets and energy infrastructure – flew for more than five hours over the Baltic Sea, escorted by fighter jets.On Thursday Trumplaunched his international “board of peace”, established to manage a peace process in Gaza. Critics have said the ill-defined board appears to be a shadow United Nations.Ukraine, along with Russia and Belarus, has been invited to join the initiative but has so far demurred.“For us, it’s understandable that we will be on this board when the war will end,” Zelenskyy said. For now, “we are enemies [with the Russians]. Belarus is an ally of the Russians. We can’t be with them.”After Witkoff’s meetings at the Kremlin, Ukraine, Russia and the US will hold three-way talks in Abu Dhabi this weekend, marking the first time that the three countries have sat down together since Russia invaded in 2022. It was not clear whether the meetings would be held through shuttle diplomacy with the US acting as intermediary.“It will be the first trilateral meeting in the United Arab Emirates,” Zelenskyy said, without giving details on who would be attending from each country. “I hope [the] Emirates know about it. Sometimes we have such surprises from the American side.”On the trilateral meeting, Trump said late on Thursday: “Anytime we meet, it’s good.”While the US has said that a deal is within reach, Zelenskyy was less bullish, saying that Russia had to be “ready for compromises … not just Ukraine”.“We will see what the result will be,” he said. “It’s better than to not have any kind of dialogue.”Explore more on these topicsVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineDavos 2026EuropeGreenlandRussiaNatonewsShareReuse this content"

Nato states, she said, backed having a permanent presence in the Arctic region including around Greenland.Stressing repeatedly that Danish sovereignty was not up for discussion, she said the US and Denmark “have to work together respectfully without threatening each other”.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, stillwearing the aviator shadesthat drew global attention in Davos, said Europe needed to “remain extremely vigilant and ready to use the instruments at our disposal should we find ourselves the target of threats again”.View image in fullscreenFrance's President Emmanuel Macron  arrives at the special European Summit in Brussels.Photograph: Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThe German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, welcomed Trump’s change of heart: “I am very grateful that President Trump has distanced himself from his original plans to take over Greenland, and I am also grateful that he has refrained from imposing additional tariffs on 1 February.”Several EU leaders stressed determination to maintain the US as an ally. “I still treat the United States as our closest friend,” the Lithuanian president, Gitanas Nausėda, said, referencing the two US battalions deployed in his country.Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, another staunch transatlanticist, said: “Europe should be here absolutely united to protect our relations with our partners on the other side of the Atlantic, even if it is much more difficult than ever before.”But he went on to say that politics needed “trust and respect … not domination and for sure not coercion”.View image in fullscreenThe prime minister of Greenland, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, says the largely self-governing territory wants a “peaceful dialogue” with the US, but that its sovereignty is non-negotiable.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APGreenland, which left the EU in 1985, alsoinsisted that its sovereignty be respected. Speaking in Nuuk, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Greenland’s prime minister, said he did not know what was in the deal but emphasised that the largely self-governing territory wanted a “peaceful dialogue” with the US, and its sovereignty was non-negotiable.If Greenlanders had to choose, he said: “We choose the Kingdom ofDenmark, we choose the EU, we choose Nato.”What’s in Trump’s Greenland ‘deal’ and will it last?Read moreThe summit came after awithering takedown of Europe from Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who accused the continent of being slow to act on key decisions in contrast with the US’s bold actions on Iran and Venezuela. Europe, he said, needed a united armed forces to defend the continent. “Right now, Nato exists thanks to the belief that the United States will act … but what if it doesn’t?”Europe had allocated €188.6bn to Ukraine by 31 October 2025 since January 2022, according to theKiel Institute for the World Economy, but decision making has often been slow, with hesitancy from some countries in releasing some military equipment.Referring to the EU’s financial aid for Ukraine, including a€90bn loan pledged last month, von der Leyen said “actions speak louder than words”.Meanwhile the European parliament signalled on Thursday it was ready to reconsider its decision to freeze ratification of the EU-US trade deal, one of the bloc’s strongest responses to Trump’s tariff threats so far.MEPs had been expected to vote in February to approve 0% tariffs on many US goods, a key part of the trade agreement signed at Trump’s Turnberry golf resort last summer, but pressed pause on the process on Wednesday in response to tariff threats.The European parliament can now go ahead with discussions on the EU-US trade deal, following Trump’s tariff threat reversal, its president, Roberta Metsola, said.Earlier in the day the head of the European parliament’s trade committee, the German Social Democrat lawmaker Bernd Lange, said his committee would revisit the issue next week, while stressing that the EU needed to remain vigilant.“There is no room for false security,” he wrote on X. “The next threat is sure to come. That’s why it is even more important that we set clear boundaries, use all available legal instruments [and] apply them as appropriate to the situation.”In response to Trump’s tariff threats, the EU had beendiscussing levying duties on €93bn of US goods, as well as deploying its most powerful economic sanctions weapon, the anti-coercion instrument, which would allow the bloc to impose a broad range of economic penalties on US companies.Even the EU’s most transatlantic-minded governments said such a response could be necessary if the tariffs went ahead.European leaders had watched with growing alarm as Trump insisted on a US takeover of Greenland, a move that threatened to split Nato and the wider western alliance. European governments feared failure to resist a US takeover of Greenland would cast legitimacy over a Chinese seizure of Taiwan or a Russian invasion of the Baltic states, smashing the post-1945 rules-based order.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump holds a signed founding charter at the ‘board of peace’ meeting during the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, as other world leaders stand behind.Photograph: Gian Ehrenzeller/EPAWhile that threat has subsided, for now, European leaders shared their concerns about Trump’s proposed “board of peace”, amid fears he is seeking to create a rival to the UN.The European Council President António Costa, who chaired the meeting, said the EU had “serious doubts” about a number of elements in Trump’s board of peace, including its scope, governance and compatibility with the UN. He said the EU was ready to work with Trump on his peace plan for Gaza, where the board of peace was envisaged as a transitional administration for the strip, an idea endorsed by the UN.Launched in Davoson Thursday, the “board of peace” was initially part of Trump’s peace and reconstruction plan for Gaza, but is morphing into an organisation with a sprawlinggeopolitical roleoperating under his direct control. So far, Hungary and Bulgaria are the only EU member states to accept an invitation to join the “board of peace”, while France, Sweden and non-EU Norway and the UK have all declined.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropeUS foreign policyGreenlandDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

We have to respect international law, sovereignty,” Nielsen said, adding that if Greenlanders had to choose, “we choose the Kingdom ofDenmark, we choose the EU, we choose Nato”.Nielsen told a press conference in the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk: “Nobody other than Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark have the mandate to make deals or agreements about Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark without us.”A day afterbacking away from his threat to use tariffs as leverage to seize Greenland, and ruling out the use of force, Trump said on Thursday that the“framework of a future deal”gave the US “total access” with “no end, no time limit”.The US president had on Wednesday hailed an “ultimate long-term deal” withNatothat he said would settle the transatlantic dispute over Greenland after weeks of rising tensions that risked the biggest breakdown in transatlantic relations in decades.But the precise terms of the agreement apparently struck between Trump andMark Rutte, the alliance’s secretary general, remained unclear and the Danish government also insisted there was no question of it compromising territorial integrity.The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Nato states backed having a “permanent presence” in the Arctic, including around Greenland.“Everybody in Nato agrees about that – the Arctic states, but also other member states – that we need a permanent presence from Nato in the Arctic region, including around Greenland,” she said, arriving at an EU summit in Brussels that was hastily convened earlier this week in response to Trump’s threats.Denmark’s status as a sovereign state, she stressed repeatedly, was not up for negotiation and “it cannot be discussed, it cannot be changed”. Asked whether she trusted the US administration, she replied: “We have been working very closely with the US for many years, but we have to work together respectfully without threatening each other.”View image in fullscreenMette Frederiksen said matters of security, investment and economy were not up for discussion.Photograph: Thomas Traasdahl/ReutersSpeaking at a campaign-style rally in Ohio on Thursday, the US vice-president, JD Vance, said negotiations with Nato were “going fine”. Vance said Greenland mattered to US national security because “our entire missile defence relies on security in the Arctic”.Trump’s repeated and aggressive assertions that the US needed “complete control” of Greenland have threatened to reignite a trade war withEuropeand also risked unravelling the Nato alliance that has guaranteed western security for decades.At the weekend, he threatenedto impose a 10% tariffon imports from Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland unless they dropped their objections to his plans, prompting EU leaders to consider retaliation.After meeting with Trump in Davos, Rutte told Reuters on Thursday that Nato senior commanders would “work out what is necessary”, adding: “I have no doubt we can do this quite fast. Certainly I would hope for 2026, I hope even early in 2026.”Nato members mapThe Nato secretary general earlier told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that he had had a “very good discussion” with Trump on how the transatlantic defence alliance’s members could bolster Arctic security.“One workstream coming out of yesterday … is to make sure when it comes to Greenland, particularly, that we ensure that the Chinese and the Russians will not gain access to the Greenland economy [or] militarily to Greenland,” he said.EU leaders met in Brussels to discuss how to handle the unpredictable US president amid a sense that transatlantic ties have been badly damaged by his Greenland grab.Transatlantic relations “have definitely taken a big blow over the last week” but Europeans were “not willing to junk 80 years of good relations” with the US, said the EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas.Other EU leaders also showed determination to maintain the US as an ally. “I still treat the United States as our closest friend,” the Lithuanian president, Gitanas Nausėda, said, referencing the two US battalions deployed in his country.Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, another staunch transatlanticist, said: “Europe should be here absolutely united to protect our relations with our partners on the other side of the Atlantic even if it is much more difficult than ever before.” But he added that politics needed “trust and respect … not domination and for sure not coercion”.The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, welcomed Trump’s change of heart. “I am very grateful that President Trump has distanced himself from his original plans to take over Greenland, and I am also grateful that he has refrained from imposing additional tariffs on 1 February,” he said.Emmanuel Macron of France, stillwearing aviator shadesto cover an eye infection, said Europe needed to “remain extremely vigilant and ready to use the instruments at our disposal should we find ourselves the target of threats again.”Nato’s top military commander in Europe, Gen Alexus Grynkewich of the US, said the alliance had not yet received political guidance but was “doing some thinking about how we would organise for it. No planning has started, but we’re ready.”Shaken EU governments remain wary of another abrupt change of mind from Trump, considered by many in national capitals and Brussels to be a power-monger to whom the bloc will sooner or later have to stand up.Trump has repeatedly said the US needs to take control of Greenland for “national security”, despite the US already having a military base on the island and a bilateral agreement with Denmark allowing it to significantly expand its presence there.Media reports suggested Wednesday’s putative deal could revolve around a renegotiation of that 1951 defence pact, which was updated in 2004 to take account of Greenlandic home rule. The US has one base on Greenland, the Pituffik space base.View image in fullscreenPeople protest in front of the US consulate in Nuuk, Greenland, on Thursday.Photograph: Marko Đurica/ReutersFrederiksen said Denmark wished to “continue a constructive dialogue with its allies on ways to strengthen security in the Arctic, including the US Golden Dome [missile-defence system], provided this is done with respect for our territorial integrity”.Trump declaration of Greenland framework deal met with scepticism amid tariff reliefRead moreEuropean leaders had lined up to criticise what the French president, Emmanuel Macron,called Trump’s “new colonialism”.The bloc also floated retaliatory economic action, including tariffs on €93bn (£80bn) of US imports and the bloc’s “big bazooka” – its “anti-coercion instrument” – which would limit US access to European markets including investment and digital services.Teresa Ribera, a European Commission executive vice-president, said the EU needed to speak up against Trump. “Silence is too ambiguous, too dangerous,” she said inan interview with La Vanguardia. “If Europe remains silent in the face of Trump, it fuels fear.”A European diplomat agreed that a strong EU reaction had influenced Trump. “EU firmness and unity have contributed to get him to change his position,” they said. “Obviously also internal political pressure in the US, and market reaction.”However, Germany’s vice-chancellor, Lars Klingbeil, said Europe “should wait and see what substantive agreements are reached. No matter what solution is now found, everyone must understand that we cannot sit back, relax and be satisfied.”Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkDonald TrumpNatoUS foreign policyMark RutteTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It envisages a unified Palestinian-run Gaza, which represents a rebuff to the aims of Israeli extremists, including some in the governing coalition, who have soughtthe deportation of Gaza’s population and the building of Israeli settlementsin its place.The plan’s success will depend largely on whether Trump and his board of peace has the determination to implement the plan, overcoming Israeli objections and obstruction – and whether a mechanism can be created inside Gaza to oversee the disarming of Hamas.Trump claims world ‘richer, safer’ than year ago at launch of his ‘board of peace’Read moreA slideshow presented in Davos by Trump’s son-in-lawJared Kushnerimagined a futuristic dreamscape of gleaming apartment blocks and office towers, with neat industrial parks and residential districts – and even an airport. The territory had a slice taken off it to create a buffer zone along the Israeli border, and was treated as blank slate, ignoring the property rights of generations of Palestinians, but it was a move away from a partition between Hamas and Israeli-run halves.The plan also spelled out more achievable promises for the next 100 days, including the restoration of basic infrastructure – including water, sewage and electric systems, hospitals and bakeries – together with a significant increase in the flow of goods enteringGaza. The critical Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt is due to open for traffic next week, for the first time since Israeli troops seized control of it in May 2024.Kushner committed the US administration to achieving those short-term goals.“The next 100 days we’re going to continue to just be heads down and focused on making sure this is implemented,” he said. “We continue to be focused on humanitarian aid, humanitarian shelter, but then creating the conditions to move forward.”View image in fullscreenJared Kushner presenting the Gaza plan at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APThe board of peace will be represented in Gaza by a “high representative”, a veteran Bulgarian and UN diplomat, Nickolay Mladenov. But the plan, as spelled out in Davos, puts much of the onus for implementation on the newly formed National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), a panel of Palestinian non-partisan technocrats who are supposed to run Gaza for a transition period.Its chair, the “chief commissioner” Ali Shaath, addressed the assembled world leaders in Davos by video link from Cairo, but also spoke directly to the people of Gaza, largely ignored so far in the Trump peace plan.“Step by step, with discipline and determination, we will rebuild a capable Gaza, capable of self-reliance, and we will build it into a centre for freedom, opportunity and peace,” Shaath told his fellow Palestinians.Shaath, an engineer and a former deputy transport minister in the Palestinian Authority, said the NCAG’s mission was “to restore order, to rebuild institutions and to recreate a future for the people of Gaza defined by opportunity and dignity under the principle of one authority, one law and one weapon”.According to documents supplied by the administration, “one weapon” means that all weapon possession in the future Gaza can be “authorised by one authority only (NCAG)”.The clause addressed a major and immediate hurdle to turning a semi-observed ceasefire into a real and lasting truce. US and Israeli officials agree there will not be further withdrawals by the Israeli army (still occupying more than half of Gaza) until Hamas disarms.Hamas has reportedly agreed in principle to hand over its heavy weapons, such as rockets and artillery, to a Palestinian administration, and is said to be prepared to accept the NCAG.To put that to the test, Shaath and the NCAG would have to be allowed to enter Gaza with a Palestinian police force that has been trained in Jordan and Egypt over past months.The plan presented in Davos notably made no mention of the international stabilisation force (ISF), which was a key part of Trump’s peace proposals last year, endorsed in November by aUN security council resolution.Creating the ISF has been fraught with problems. None of the countries in the Arab and Islamic world that provisionally agreed to provide troops wanted their soldiers to confront Hamas over its weaponry. Israel declared it wouldnot accept Turkish or Qatari forces, while other potential troop contributors insisted that Turkey and Qatar were involved.The US blueprint mentions only the new Palestinian police force. Heavy weapons would be “decommissioned immediately”, it said.“Personal arms [will be] registered and decommissioned by sector as NCAG police becomes capable of guaranteeing personal security,” the blueprint said. The end state would be a situation in which “only NCAG-sanctioned personnel may carry weapons”.The immediate test of the blueprint will come next week, when the Rafah crossing is due to open. “Opening Rafah signals Gaza is no longer closed to the future or to the world. This is a real step and it marks a new direction,” Shaath said in his video presentation.However, Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet is due to discuss the opening of Rafah next week. There is considerable opposition inside the coalition to reopening the crossing, at least until the remains of the last unaccounted-for Israeli hostage, Ran Gvili, are returned.There will be considerably more internal opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian interim government in territory, which the far right is bent on emptying and annexing. The plan does not say a future Gaza would be part of a sovereign Palestinian state. But it does not exclude a unifiedPalestine, and it is unlikely the NCAG would be able to recruit credible Palestinian members if it did.Under the plan, the Israeli army would withdraw progressively from all Gaza territory in phases from the current truce line agreed as part of phase 1 of the plan. That further withdrawal would be “based on agreed-upon standards”, the Kushner blueprint said, but it gave no details, raising questions over whether Israel would comply.For the population of Gaza, most still living in tents andunder regular Israeli fire, perhaps the most encouraging aspect of Thursday’s presentation in Davos was that Trump clearly still sees his prestige and that of his “board of peace” as being wrapped up in the ceasefire he brokered last year.In other words, the ceasefire plan is still harnessed to the bulldozer of the president’s self-esteem, which at least has the potential to break through the substantial hurdles to a free and peaceful Gaza.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineDonald TrumpJared KushnerIsraelUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The charter proposed by the White House does not mention the Palestinian territory.Pressed on whether the UK would join the “board of peace”, Cooper told BBC Breakfast that Britain “won’t be one of the signatories” on Thursday.“There’s a huge amount of work to do. We won’t be one of the signatories today,” she said. “Because this is about a legal treaty that raises much broader issues, and we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something which is talking about peace, when we have still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be a commitment to peace in Ukraine. And to be honest, that is also what we should be talking about.”Board of peace membersCooper said Vladimir Putin had shown no willingness “to come and make that agreement, and that’s where the pressure needs to be now”. She added: “But we will have continuing international discussions including with our allies.”The Kremlin announced that the Russian president had been invited to join the Trump body on Monday. At Davos, Trump said Putin had accepted an invitation to join the initiative. A Kremlin spokesperson told journalists on Monday thatRussiawas seeking to “clarify all the nuances” of the offer with Washington before giving its response.Thefirst appointments to the board, announced last week, included Trump as chair, with a “founding executive board” that included the former British prime minister Tony Blair and the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.Also appointed were Trump’s troubleshooting envoy, the property developer Steve Witkoff, the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and the president of the World Bank, Ajay Banga. Countries including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Israel have said they will become members of the board.As talks to end the war in Ukraine continue, Trump is due to meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in Davos on Thursday. In a rambling speech at Davos on Wednesday, Trump said “we’re reasonably close” to a deal on Ukraine.Referencing an expected meeting with Zelenskyy, he said: “They are at a point now where they can come together [with Vladimir Putin] and get a deal done … And if they don’t, they are stupid, that goes for both of them.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyDonald TrumpUS foreign policyGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Kushner also presented an aspirationalmapof a future Gaza in which the territory had a buffer zone around the border with Israel but was unified, rather than partitioned as it is now.In the most dramatic moment of the ceremony, Ali Shaath, the Palestinian official chosen to run an interim administration in Gaza, appeared by video link to announce that the Rafah crossing from Gaza to Egypt would be reopened next week for traffic in both directions for the first time since May 2024.Describing Rafah as Gaza’s lifeline, Shaath said: “Opening Rafah signals Gaza is no longer closed to the future or to the world.”Addressing the people of Gaza, Shaath said: “Step by step, with discipline and determination we will rebuild a capable Gaza – capable of self-reliance – and we will build it into a centre for freedom, opportunity and peace.”View image in fullscreenA plan for the reconstruction of Gaza displayed during Jared Kushner’s presentation.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe announcements are likely to alarm the Israeli coalition led by the country’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, which is opposed to a unified and Palestinian-run Gaza. Some ministers support the building of Israeli settlements on occupied territory, and several are opposed to the reopening of Rafah before the body of the Israeli hostage Ran Gvili, the last to be accounted for, is handed over by Hamas.The Israeli cabinet was due to convene on Thursday to discuss Rafah and the other developments announced inDavos.Trump himself focused on his past achievements andrepeated hisdisputed claim to have stopped eight wars. “We put out all those fires. Most people didn’t know, including me, that some of those wars were going on,” he said.Ministers and heads of government from 19 countries filed on to the stage and took their seats before Trump took to the podium and called it “one of the most important meetings of all”.Countries represented by the 18 men and one woman – the president of Kosovo, Vjosa Osmani – included Morocco, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan and Saudi Arabia. Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, was also present.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump talks to Kosovo’s president, Vjosa Osmani, during a signing ceremony in Davos.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APTrump described them as “in most cases very popular leaders – in some cases, not so popular, but that’s the way it goes in life”. He also claimed that the organisation would be “one of the most consequential bodies ever created in the history of the world”.Trump was joined at a table on the stage to sign a document inaugurating the body by the Moroccan foreign minister, Nasser Bourita, and Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa of Bahrain. Other leaders then approached to sign in pairs, their names read out by Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt.Some diplomats had warned that Trump might hope the organisation would supplant the United Nations, but the US president claimed the two could work together.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump shakes hands with Bahrain’s Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa at Davos on Thursday.Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters“I think the combination of the board of peace with the kind of people we have here, coupled with the United Nations could be something very, very unique for the world,” he said, adding that the UN had “tremendous potential” that had yet to be realised.The board, to be chaired by Trump, was initially mooted as part of his plan for a ceasefire in Gaza.However, more recently he has suggested the board could take on a much broader geopolitical role. When asked by a reporter on Tuesday whether the fledgling body should replace the UN, Trump said: “It might.”Last week, heannounced a “founding executive board”for the body, including the former UK prime minister Tony Blair, the World Bank president, Ajay Banga, and Kushner.Trump claimed the war in Gaza had been reduced to “little fires”. He said Hamas would “have to give up their weapons” and claimed that its members were “born with rifles in their hands”.Earlier on Thursday, the British foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper,said the UK would not be signing upto the “board of peace” for the moment.“There’s a huge amount of work to do – we won’t be one of the signatories today, because this is about a legal treaty that raises much broader issues, and we do also have concerns about President [Vladimir] Putin being part of something which is talking about peace, when we have still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be a commitment to peace in Ukraine, and to be honest, that is also what we should be talking about,” she said.Russia has not attended the World Economic Forum since invading Ukraine in 2022. Putin has said Moscow is still consulting with “strategic partners” before deciding whether to commit to the plan.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpGazaUS foreign policyIsraelDavos 2026PalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The judge calculated she worked an average of more than 17 hours a day, she was expected to care for the children and provide other domestic services and was not given rest days, lunch breaks or days off.According to the judgment she was fed “inadequately” and was subject to “verbal abuse and threats”. The family withheld her passport, she was denied internet access in the flat and not given a UK sim card for the first few months. The woman had no family, friends or support network in the UK.While she received some money during her time with the family, it was significantly below the minimum wage at the time – just £400 for the 12 weeks she was with the family in London before she escaped.In November 2014, the Home Office recognised that she was a victim of human trafficking. The UAE government did not attend court for the case. In December 2015 she was granted leave to remain in the UK.A total of £262,292.76 was awarded to her in damages for false imprisonment, injury to feelings and personal injury due to a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of her experience with the family. The court was told that due to her experience with the family, she could not trust any employer and was in constant fear of being subjected to the same treatment she received from the Aljaberi family if she was re-employed.The judge said that part of the damages he was awarding were “exemplary” damages, which are punitive rather than compensatory. He said: “I accept that such an award is appropriate in a case in which Mr Aljaberi acted with a cynical disregard for the claimant’s rights and exploited the claimant for his own financial advantage.”He said that he had awarded the damages due to the “wrongfulness of Mr Aljaberi’s conduct”. He added that withholding of her wages was “part of the servitude which was inflicted on her”.Her solicitor, Zubier Yazdani of Deighton Pierce Glynn, said: “This is a welcome decision. It goes some way to providing accountability for the harm that my client suffered. Domestic workers in diplomatic households have been vulnerable to abuse for too long. Sending states should share responsibility where their diplomats exploit domestic workers.”The UAE embassy was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsHuman traffickingUnited Arab EmiratesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Under the international covenant on civil and political rights (ICCPR), Jordan is required to comply with strict limits on the targeting of political dissidents and civil society with surveillance technology.Researchers said they analyzed four mobile phones between January 2024 and June 2025 that belonged to members of Jordanian civil society who had been detained, arrested or interrogated by authorities, and that all had been subjected to forensic extraction using Cellebrite.The names of individuals who were targeted were not released because the individuals feared reprisals. In one case described in Citizen Lab’s report, researchers said they analyzed the iPhone of a political activist whose device was seized after an interrogation by Jordan’s general intelligence department, and that the phone remained in their custody for 35 days.In another case, a student activist refused to provide a passcode to their phone to officers, who then unlocked it using Apple’s Face ID while holding it up to the activist’s face. The person was taken to prison the next day. Upon their release, the activist was given their phone back but found their passcode written on a piece of tape that had been stuck to the back of the phone. An analysis of the device later found that it had been connected to an external device that was attributed to Cellebrite, and was also connected to a cybercrime unit in Amman while it was in the custody of authorities.In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson for Cellebrite said that unlike spyware made by companies like NSO Group, the company’s technology is forensic in nature and used to “access private data only in accordance with legal due process or with appropriate consent to aid investigations legally after an event has occurred”.“The company vets potential customers against internal human rights parameters, leading us to historically cease business in jurisdictions where risks were deemed incompatible with our corporate values,” the spokesperson said. The company added: “We take seriously all allegations of potential misuse of our technology in ways that would run counter to both explicit and implied conditions outlined in our end-user agreement. Once solid information is shared with Cellebrite, we review the allegations and take proactive precise steps to investigate each claim in accordance with our ethics and integrity policies.”The Jordanian government did not respond to a request for comment.Cellebrite products have reportedly been used to target members of civil society in other parts of the world, including in Myanmar and Botswana. There have also beenindications of its use in SerbiaandBelarus.Explore more on these topicsJordanIsraelGazaSurveillanceProtestPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Whether you live in a coastal town or a rural village, you deserve the same shot at survival and quality of life as everyone else.”Streeting hopes more staff will allow patients to access cancer care more quickly, improve early diagnosis and increase survival rates, which are low compared with similar countries.Hospitals in poorer areas, many of which are located rurally or on the coast, often have fewer doctors – especially senior specialists – than those in cities and big teaching hospitals, which leaves patients waiting longer to be seen. Many have fewer cancer consultants than hospitals elsewhere.Attracting enough doctors to work in such places is often a challenge, which has led to a disproportionate number of medical roles being filled by medics from overseas.GP surgeries in poorer areas are also affected by “under-doctoring”, further reducing access to care in places with the highest level of health need.The initiative will result in more doctors in the early stages of their careers being offered specialist training posts in such hospitals, rather than increased numbers of consultants working there.However, it is unclear how many extra training places in cancer medicine it will produce. That is still subject to discussion between the Department ofHealthand Social Care and NHS England.The scheme is one of a host of measures to improve cancer care in England that will be announced in the government’s new national cancer plan on 4 February, WorldCancerDay.Streeting – himself a cancer survivor – hopes that more cancer doctors working in rural and coastal hospitals will also help to reduce economic inactivity, which is higher in those places.Gemma Peters, the chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: “Right now, cancer care isn’t fair. Too many people’s experiences are being shaped by who they are and where they live.“We know that many people in rural and coastal communities can face worse cancer outcomes, and expanding the cancer workforce in these places is a vital step towards tackling these inequalities.”Michelle Mitchell, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, added: “No one should be at a greater risk of dying of cancer because of where they live, but cancer death rates are around a third higher for people living in the most deprived areas of England compared to the least deprived.“Ensuring everybody across England can access the best diagnostic tests is also crucial. It’s promising to see that the sponge on a string test, funded by Cancer Research UK to spot conditions that could lead to oesophageal cancer, is one of the new innovations the government is looking to roll out more quickly. Beating cancer must mean beating it for everybody, and the national cancer plan for England has a huge opportunity to bring us closer to this goal.”The plan will also set new targets for how quickly cancer patients receive care and treatment, and put more money into new technologies, including AI, to detect signs of the disease earlier.Dr Stephen Harden, the president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said: “Boosting the cancer workforce and embracing the latest technology to help spot cancer earlier are important steps to speed up diagnosis and treatment.”But hospitals needed more senior doctors, not just those still in training, he added. “To ensure patients in underserved areas benefit in the long term, it will be essential that permanent consultant posts are available so cancer doctors can stay and build fulfilling careers locally once training is complete.”Explore more on these topicsNHSCancerHealthEnglandInequalityLabournewsShareReuse this content"

He prompted outrage withinNo 10 and among cabinet ministerswhen he said in the run up to the party’s conference last year that many MPs hadurged him to run for Labour leader.He has long been believed to be seeking a return to parliament tostand for the Labour leadershipif there was a challenge to Starmer, but was thought to have limited options for a byelection in the north-west of England.The government will have to move the writ for a byelection, which two well-placed sources suggested was likely to take place before the May elections, meaning Burnham could be in place for any aftermath.But his allies have cautioned not to overstate the extent of planning that might be under way, suggesting that he was passionate about his current job and would only return to national politics if he had something to contribute.“People want to paint him as scheming and plotting but that’s absolutely not where he is. He loves being mayor ofManchester. It would only ever be an option if felt he had something to offer,” one said.But with polls suggesting Starmer is unpopular in the country and many MPs despondent about Labour’s fate at the next election, Burnham stands out as the only seniorLabourfigure with positive public approval ratings.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Andy Burnham after Labour’s win in 2024.Photograph: Ian Vogler/Daily Mirror/PAShould Burnham decide to run, there are still multiple obstacles standing in his way. He would need to be selected by the NEC – where the odds are stacked against him – and win the byelection in Gorton and Denton against Reform UK and pro-Gaza independents, all before any potential leadership challenge.Senior Labour figures told the Guardian that a “Stop Andy” campaign was already under way, with the party machinery tightly controlled by Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s chief of staff, and his allies.The prime minister himself said on Thursday that the byelection process was in the “early stages” and his MPs must stop talking about potential leadership challenges.“My message is to my entire party, and is that every minute we waste talking about anything other than the cost of living and stability in Europe and across the globe is a wasted minute,” he told Channel 4 News.Burnham, speaking before Gwynne confirmed he was stepping down, told reporters: “People shouldn’t rush to conclusions. I have been very focused on my role as mayor of Greater Manchester and I think the [reindustrialisation] plan I put out this week shows that.”Five members of the NEC told the Guardian they believed it would be impossible for Burnham to make it through the selection panel given the number of Starmer allies in the committee and how they could be handpicked to sit on the selection panel.They said this was not just down to personal animosity to Burnham, but also the cost of a mayoral byelection in Greater Manchester, which would mean that about £500,000 of party funding was diverted from other races across Britain.“It is deeply selfish of Andy to want to run for this – costing us tens of thousands we don’t have and diverting activist resources when we are fighting other crucial elections. It is absurd beyond description and cannot be allowed,” one said.Several sources shared concerns about Nigel Farage’s party attempting to fill any vacancy created by Burnham. “What if Reform won the Greater Manchester mayoralty? It would be totemic for them: their biggest win yet. We would be mad to let that happen,” one said.Burnham, as a publicly elected mayor, would have to secure the NEC’s permission to run. It is also possible the body could impose an all-female shortlist in order to stop his nomination.However, one Burnham ally warned against assuming the NEC would automatically block his candidacy, even though Starmer’s team is widely thought to control it.“I don’t think anybody wants a big fight within the NEC. That’s not where anybody wants to end up. Nobody benefits from that. But you would be unwise to second guess the NEC,” they said.The unions are a significant force on the party’s ruling body, holding 13 out of about 40 seats. The biggest unions – Unite, Unison and the GMB – were for now keeping their counsel, although sources suggested they would be uncomfortable with anything that looked like interference from No 10.Labour’s Andrew Gwynne resigns paving the way for return of Andy Burnham as an MP– as it happenedRead moreBut even with their support, two insiders suggested Burnham could still struggle to get the numbers to overrule a selection panel and get on the shortlist for the seat, clearing the NEC.The Fire Brigades Union general secretary, Steve Wright, said: “It would be a democratic outrage ifAndy Burnhamwas blocked from seeking selection as Labour’s byelection candidate in this seat.“In the event that a byelection takes place, as an affiliated union, the FBU will not stand by and allow seniorLabourpoliticians like Andy to be carved out of this process. Our union will fiercely resist any attempts to stitch up the selection.“It’s vital that there is a full and open democratic procedure to choose Labour’s candidate to fight this byelection. Anything less would be unacceptable.”Another said that MPs and members were already concerned about the risk of destabilising the party with leadership speculation before the local and devolved elections in May. “I don’t think anybody would thank Andy for triggering more of that,” one said.Gwynne has a 13,413 majority in the seat, which lies to the south-east of Manchester. Reform UK is likely to mount a significant challenge in any byelection, capitalising on support in the Tameside part of the constituency.Labour believes it is on firmer ground in the larger, Greater Manchester part of the seat, although could face some pressure from pro-Gaza independents.Should Burnham return to parliament, he would have to secure the backing of 80 Labour MPs to challenge Starmer, although the mayor – who served in Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s governments – is viewed with scepticism by some on the backbenches.Gwynne was said by some MPs to have reached an agreement with Burnham to allow the Greater Manchester mayor to stand in his seat after he quit, but the two are not close and both have denied any pact.There had been speculation for months that Gwynne was trying to strike a deal with the MPs pension authority that would allow him to retire early on grounds of ill health.Friends of the MP said that would mean he would receive a yearly payout until he reached retirement age, when he would be entitled to the full pension.On Thursday, Gwynne confirmed that his mental health had deteriorated to such an extent that he was stepping down, triggering a byelection in his constituency.Andy Burnham’s road back to parliament would be a bumpy oneRead moreThe former minister said in a statement that while proud of his achievements in parliament, he had “suffered significant ill-health over most of the 21 years I’ve served as an MP”.He quoted a note from his GP, who said that he was “extremely vulnerable and further stress will cause rapid deterioration”, and that he did not think he could safely return to parliament.Gwynne added: “I wish theLabourgovernment every success in meeting our country’s challenges head-on and providing the real change the people of Britain voted for in 2024”.Gwynne is still subject to a parliamentary standards investigation, which wasinitiated last yearafter he was found to have been in a WhatsApp group – called Trigger Me Timbers – that shared vulgar and inflammatory comments about voters and other MPs. He was suspended from the party after the messages came to light.Explore more on these topicsAndy BurnhamLabourKeir StarmerManchesterGreater ManchesterByelectionsnewsShareReuse this content"

But her successor, Steve Reed, has admitted the reasons for not requiring an environmental impact assessment were “inadequate” and that “permission should be quashed”.The government had made a “serious logical error”, it conceded, during a legal challenge to the approval this week.The scheme, also known as the West London Technology Park, has been hailed by promoters as having the potential to attract£1bn of foreign direct investment. The U-turn comes after environmental campaigners concerned about the carbon emissions and water use of energy-hungry datacentres claimed the approval was unlawful.They accused the government of being too accepting of the developer’s assurances about the environmental impact and failing to properly consider the energy use.The case is a blow to the government’s strategy of accelerating the construction of datacentres to attract investment from technology companies. In September 2024 it designated datacentres – which train and operate AI systems – as critical national infrastructure, signalling their importance to the British economy. Peter Kyle, the former technology secretary, called them “the engines of modern life, they power the digital economy and keep our most personal information safe”.The 72,000 sq metre (18-acre) datacentre on a former landfill site in Iver is being developed by Greystoke, which declined to comment.“It shouldn’t take us having to drag the government to court for them to admit their decision to back big tech’s polluting datacentres was fundamentally wrong,” said Rosa Curling, a co-executive director of the tech equity organisation Foxglove.“For too long, ministers have been putting the profits of Trump-supporting tech billionaires ahead of the interests of the British public. Nowhere has this been clearer than their willingness to force through massive datacentres against the wishes of the local community, without a thought for the catastrophic damage they will cause to our environment.”Sonja Graham, the chief executive of Global Action Plan, an environmental charity that was part of the legal challenge, said: “This embarrassing climbdown could have been avoided had the government done its job and scrutinised big tech’s flimsy carbon commitments in the first place.”She added: “People across the UK are increasingly concerned about datacentres’ proliferation and what it means for access to water and power. The government being asleep at the wheel like this will do nothing to reassure them.”The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Governmentsaid the government had confirmed to the court on Monday that the secretary of state wished to concede the challenge and accepted that permission should be quashed.The UK had approximately 1.6 gigawatts of datacentre capacity in 2024, which is forecast to rise up to four times by 2030. However, that may still not be enough to meet demand,government analysis found.Last year Kyleattackedthe “archaic planning processes” holding up the construction of technology infrastructure and said: “The datacentres we need to power our digital economy get blocked because they ruin the view from the M25.”Explore more on these topicsPlanning policyAI (artificial intelligence)BuckinghamshireEnergyLabournewsShareReuse this content"

That is why we are removing the incentives that draw illegal migrants to Britain, closing asylum hotels that are blighting communities. Crowborough is just the start. I will bring forward site after site until every asylum hotel is closed and returned to local communities,” she said.Campaigners opposed to the Home Office’s decision to place asylum seekers in Crowborough barracks called on the local council to issue a stop notice to halt the move of people on to the site.Crowborough Shield, which has launched a legal challenge against the decision, says Wealden district council is uniquely positioned to act swiftly, using statutory powers that do not require court intervention.“We urge councillors to exercise those powers,” the campaigners said.A Crowborough Shield spokesperson said: “We remain determined to have the home secretary’s decision overturned. Our case has always been about the secretive and improper use of emergency powers to bypass planning law, public scrutiny, and community consultation. As set out in our claim, the occupation of the camp has occurred in precisely the clandestine manner we warned the court it would.”The latest Home Office figures show the number of asylum seekers being temporarily housed in hotels increased by 13% to 36,273 at the end of September. More than 400 hotels were opened under the last government at a cost of £9m a day. Just under 200 remain in use.Officials had originally hoped to transfer people to the East Sussex barracks in the first week of December. The move was delayed until January,as reported in the Guardian last month, to ensure the sites were safe and to avoid a fiasco such aswhen legionella was found on the Bibby Stockholm barge.The new arrivals are expected to be recent arrivals to the UK, usually in small boats across the Channel.The accommodation has 24/7 security with CCTV and strict sign-in processes for residents, the Home Office said. They will also have completed health and police checks before arriving at the base.View image in fullscreenProtesters at the Crowborough camp in December.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianHundreds of people have taken to the streets of Crowborough every weekend to protest at the plans to house the undocumented male migrants close to the town.They have raised almost £100,000 to fund legal action to seek a judicial review of the scheme.On Wednesday evening, Wealden district council said the immigration minister, Alex Norris, had called to say the plan had been given the green light – a decision which could be challenged in the high court.The council leader, James Partridge, said: “I told the minister we strongly feel that is the wrong decision. Despite our strong objection the minister hasn’t listened to any of us. We have contacted our legal team to ask them to review the decision to see if there’s any way we can bring a legal challenge to it.“We know this is a long shot but we have been probing the Home Office throughout the process to see if we can find a way to bring a successful legal action. We will act if our barristers advise there is a reasonable chance of success.”Nus Ghani, the Conservative MP for Sussex Weald, where the camp is located, said the Home Office’s lack of transparency was “shameful”.“The Home Office have not bothered to share their evidence of how the site is safe, legal and compliant,” she said.Kim Bailey, who leads Crowborough Shield, has claimed the Home Office has behaved in an “underhand way” by using special “Q class rights” to bypass normal planning permissions.Class Q, or permitted development rights, allow the use of a site to be changed without a full planning application or full environmental impact assessment.Keir Starmer has pledged to end use of asylum hotels by 2029, but was warned by the home affairs select committee in October that the government must set out a clear strategy of how to reduce the use of asylum hotels and have a chance to end the “current failed, chaotic and expensive” system that has wasted taxpayers’ money.In correspondence to the committee published on Thursday, the government said ending its existing hotel contracts this year through a break clause would require “sufficient alternative supply of accommodation” to ensure continuity of service.The committee chair, Dame Karen Bradley, said it was welcome the Home Office had “finally started to get a grip” on asylum accommodation contracts.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeEast SussexEnglandProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

The broader package was approved with strong bipartisan support, on a 341-88 tally. The funding measures now move to the Senate, which must act by 30 January to avoid a partial government shutdown.Speaker Mike Johnson hailed the votes to approve the year’s final batch of spending bills as “another monumental achievement”.“Republicans have delivered once again in making the America First agenda a reality,” he said in a statement. “We have finally turned the page, and we are not turning back.”Party leaders told a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that they would vote against the homeland security funding bill, citing insufficient provisions to rein in ICE. However, they did not whip their caucus against the funding bill.In the Senate, the outstanding funding bills are expected to be stitched together into one big package, putting pressure on Senate Democrats who want to use the measure as leverage to constrain ICE.Several Democrats have already announced their opposition, including Arizona Senator Rueben Gallego, who announced on Wednesday: “Yeah, I am not voting to give whatever ICE has become more taxpayer money. It’s no longer an immigration enforcement arm of the US government.”Still, other Democrats are unlikely to reject spending for the Defense department and other key domestic agencies.The Democratic thumbs-down in the House came despite provisions in the bill that keeps the agency’s $10bn annual budget flat, reduces ICE enforcement and removal operations, and imposes a 5,500 reduction to its number of detention beds. The legislation also secured $20m for the “procurement, deployment, and operations of body worn cameras” to be worn by ICE agents, thanks to Democrats’ efforts.Such palliatives are unlikely to placate anger in the party over the agency’s operations in Minnesota.“In the last 24 hours, we’ve heard our members speak loudly that ICE isn’t doing enough, these reforms aren’t doing enough. This lawlessness has to stop,” Aguilartold reportersafter a Wednesday meeting on Capitol Hill. “They are only doing this because the president of the United States wants to use them to terrorize communities, to terrorize US citizens.”Rosa DeLauro, a representative from Connecticut and the ranking Democrat on the appropriations committee, said it was still better for the bill to pass rather than run the risk of a renewed government shutdown that could affect other agencies. “I understand that many of my Democratic colleagues may be dissatisfied with any bill that funds ICE,”she said.“I share their frustration with the out-of-control agency. I encourage my colleagues to review the bill and determine what is best for their constituents and communities.”But she added: “The Homeland Security funding bill is more than just ICE. If we allow a lapse in funding, TSA [transportation security administration] agents will be forced to work without pay, Fema [federal emergency management agency] assistance could be delayed, and the US Coast Guard will be adversely affected. All while ICE continues functioning without any change in their operations due to $75 billion it received in the One Big Beautiful Bill.”DeLauro ultimately ended up voting against the bill.Explore more on these topicsDemocratsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsHouse of RepresentativesUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier this month, he claimed it had “incorrectly and inappropriately” discriminated against him.Trump says he’ll sue JPMorgan Chase for allegedly cutting him off after US Capitol riotRead moreThe lawsuit was filed in Miami by Alejandro Brito, Trump’s Miami-based personal lawyer, who also has been involved in Trump’s legal action against media companies such as ABC News and the BBC for defamation.“While we regret President Trump has sued us, we believe the suit has no merit,” JP Morgan said in a statement. “We respect the president’s right to sue us and our right to defend ourselves – that’s what courts are for.”The bank “does not close accounts for political or religious reasons”, a spokesperson added. “We do close accounts because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company. We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so.”Shares in JP Morgan slipped slightly after the filing was first reported. They closed up 0.4% late in New York.In the lawsuit, Trump’s lawyers alleged that the bank had put Trump, the Trump Organization and its affiliated entities, along with members of Trump’s family, on a blacklist.JP Morgan “did not provide plaintiffs with any recourse, remedy or alternative – its decision was final and unequivocal”, the lawsuit claims, claiming that Trump and the other plaintiffs are “confident that JPMC’s unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations, and JPMC’s unsubstantiated, ‘woke’ beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political reviews”.Later on Thursday, Trump told reporters he had not spoken directly to Dimon.Last weekend, the presidentannouncedon social media he would file a lawsuit against the bank, accusing it of removing his accounts after the January 6 insurrection. Trump has said several banks, including JP Morgan and Bank of America, rejected his deposits after the riot, though both banks have denied the allegations.The post seemed to be inspired by a Wall Street Journalreportthat Trump had offered Dimon the role of Federal Reserve chair last year. Trump denied the accusation and said he would be suing the bank.In response to Saturday’s social media post, JP Morgan said in a statement: “We agree that no one’s account should ever be closed because of political or religious beliefs.”“We appreciate that this administration has moved to address political debanking and we support those efforts,” the statement said.Dimon, whotook home a $43m compensation packagelast year, spoke in defense of Fed chairJerome Powellearlier this month, after it emerged that Trump’s justice department hadinitiated a criminal investigationagainst him.After Powell disclosed justice department subpoenas against the Fed over the weekend, Dimon spoke out in his defense. Dimon said he has “enormous respect for Jay Powell, the man” despite disagreement over some of the Fed’s policy choices.“Anything that chips away at [the Fed’s independence] is not a good idea,” Dimon said, warning that itrisked driving up inflationand interest rates.In a swift response,Trump said Dimon was wrongand that “it’s fine what I’m doing.” “We should have lower rates,” Trump said last week. “Jamie Dimon probably wants higher rates – maybe he makes more money that way.”At the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, Dimon was particularly critical of Trump’s proposal to cap credit-card interest rates at 10% for the first year,callingthe idea a potential “economic disaster”.He alsosuggestedthe US had become less reliable under Trump. “If you said to me, ‘Has America become unreliable?’ No,” Dimon said at an event. “It’s just, you had total reliance, and now it’s less reliable.”Trump is one of several prominent rightwing figures to complain of having been “debanked” by leading financial institutions due to their political positions.In the UK, NatWest Group’s chief executive, Dame Alison Rose,stood down in 2023after she admitted being the source of an inaccurate BBC story about the reasons Reform UK leader Nigel Farage had been “debanked”.Farage threatened legal action against the bank, andlater settled.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJamie DimonUS Capitol attackUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

They closed up 0.4% late in New York.In the lawsuit, Trump’s lawyers alleged that the bank had put Trump, the Trump Organization and its affiliated entities, along with members of Trump’s family, on a blacklist.JP Morgan “did not provide plaintiffs with any recourse, remedy or alternative – its decision was final and unequivocal”, the lawsuit claims, claiming that Trump and the other plaintiffs are “confident that JPMC’s unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations, and JPMC’s unsubstantiated, ‘woke’ beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political reviews”.Later on Thursday, Trump told reporters he had not spoken directly to Dimon.Last weekend, the presidentannouncedon social media he would file a lawsuit against the bank, accusing it of removing his accounts after the January 6 insurrection. Trump has said several banks, including JP Morgan and Bank of America, rejected his deposits after the riot, though both banks have denied the allegations.The post seemed to be inspired by a Wall Street Journalreportthat Trump had offered Dimon the role of Federal Reserve chair last year. Trump denied the accusation and said he would be suing the bank.In response to Saturday’s social media post, JP Morgan said in a statement: “We agree that no one’s account should ever be closed because of political or religious beliefs.”“We appreciate that this administration has moved to address political debanking and we support those efforts,” the statement said.Dimon, whotook home a $43m compensation packagelast year, spoke in defense of Fed chairJerome Powellearlier this month, after it emerged that Trump’s justice department hadinitiated a criminal investigationagainst him.After Powell disclosed justice department subpoenas against the Fed over the weekend, Dimon spoke out in his defense. Dimon said he has “enormous respect for Jay Powell, the man” despite disagreement over some of the Fed’s policy choices.“Anything that chips away at [the Fed’s independence] is not a good idea,” Dimon said, warning that itrisked driving up inflationand interest rates.In a swift response,Trump said Dimon was wrongand that “it’s fine what I’m doing.” “We should have lower rates,” Trump said last week. “Jamie Dimon probably wants higher rates – maybe he makes more money that way.”At the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, Dimon was particularly critical of Trump’s proposal to cap credit-card interest rates at 10% for the first year,callingthe idea a potential “economic disaster”.He alsosuggestedthe US had become less reliable under Trump. “If you said to me, ‘Has America become unreliable?’ No,” Dimon said at an event. “It’s just, you had total reliance, and now it’s less reliable.”Trump is one of several prominent rightwing figures to complain of having been “debanked” by leading financial institutions due to their political positions.In the UK, NatWest Group’s chief executive, Dame Alison Rose,stood down in 2023after she admitted being the source of an inaccurate BBC story about the reasons Reform UK leader Nigel Farage had been “debanked”.Farage threatened legal action against the bank, andlater settled.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJamie DimonUS Capitol attackUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

During the US president’s first year back in office, however, food prices rose faster than they did during Joe Biden’s last.Facing negative poll numbers, Trump is taking a tack that fewRepublicanshave dared contemplate before: spewing out a rain of often incoherent proposals to signal he feels voters’ pain, in order to recapture their affection.US inflation held firm in December amid pressure on Trump over cost of livingRead moreHistory suggests it might work. Yet, a year’s worth of policy pronouncements for the working class matched with policiesto serve the richmay have exhausted voters’ goodwill toward the Trump administration.Trump’s promise to lower energy costs hasn’t panned out. Household energy prices have risen 7.3% so far on his watch, more than twice as much as during Biden’s last year in office. His promise to revitalize the auto industry isn’t performing as planned. And he hasn’t gotten anywhere near “cutting the cost of a new home in half”.A graph showing US inflation rates from 2020 to 2025.The central economic promise of his campaign, that “jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country” due to the wall of tariffs he raised around the American market, is nowhere to be seen. Indeed, as US Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, has noted, tariffs are getting in the way of curbing inflation.This has become a problem for the president. Forty-nine per cent of Americans think the economy is worse than it was a year ago, according to aWall Street Journal Pollthis month, while 54% disapprove of how the president has steered the economy. Asurvey for CNNfound that 61% disagreed with Trump’s economic policies.Trump has reacted like a whirling dervish, rattling out feelgood policy proposals even as he declares a golden age for the American economy, where “we have quickly gone from the worst numbers on record to the best and strongest numbers, and an economy that is far ahead”.The president hopes to land on a convincing message that he is, in fact, hearing the call from distressed Americans and doing something decisive for them. Whether the proposals make any sense on economic grounds, or whether they are even legal, appears immaterial.Take his recent proposal to cap credit card interest rates. It may sound great to the many indebted Americans struggling to make the monthly payment. But as many economists have pointed out, banks will probably respond by cutting off poorer, higher-risk borrowers, curtailing their access to credit.Trump claims victory on US economy despite many Americans’ cost of living concernsRead moreTrump’s proposals to cut housing costs may also appear a clear win for homebuyers and renters. They are anything but. His plan to bar investors from buying single family homes is likely to discourage the country’salready depressedresidential construction. Extending mortgages to 50 years will raise the cost of housing over the life of a loan. Allowing home buyers to use retirement accounts to finance down payments would push housing prices up by adding new demand without increasing supply.And these are the “reasonable” moves. Some of the others, likelaunching a criminal investigation into Powell, a move the Fed chair has claimed was a direct result of his refusal bow to Trump’s demands for lower interest rates, orleveraging Venezuelan oil– more expensive and risky to pull out of the ground than American oil – to cut oil prices below $50 a barrel, are detached from reality.Wacky economic proposals to signal solidarity to some political voting block are not out of character. On the campaign trail, Trump came up with a tax exemption on tips, which will benefit a tiny share of the workforce, and expire at the end of his term. He also promised not to tax social security payments, an idea aborted before it caused further damage to social security’s parlous financial footing.From the mass deportation of immigrant workers to the tariffs on imports from all over the world; from his price caps on drugs and the equity stakes he has demanded from private firms – Trump’s proposals show little coherence. Straying well outside the Republican Overton window and its commitment to free markets, they form part of an attempt to build a mirage of class solidarity with the aggrieved Americans he hopes will vote for him.Last June, the president called Zohran Mamdani “a 100% communist lunatic” as he campaigned for the New York City mayoralty, pledging to introduce free buses and government grocery stores. Based on recent announcements, it wouldn’t be a surprise if Trump called him up for policy advice.The new approach is characteristic of America’s political landscape in the post-globalization era. The quest for economic efficiency that dictated policy over more than four decades, demanding unfettered trade and investment in the service of economic growth, has been superseded by the imperative to acknowledge the grievances of the people and communities that lost out in the process.Tapping into these grievances can work. Trump’s campaign trail promises to cut food and gas prices helped him win back the presidency. As for his promise to improve the lives of workers in the industrial heartland,researchers foundthat the tariff war he launched in 2018 and 2019 helped the Republican party even when it produced job losses.Only time will tell if Americans welcome Trump’s spray of policy proposals and shrug off their concerns about his handling of the economy. As frustrations mount, the president appears desperate for this to work.Explore more on these topicsUS economyThe first year of Trump 2.0Trump administrationDonald TrumpRepublicansUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was up 1.1%, although the UK’s FTSE 100 edged up only 0.12%.In the US, Wall Street also moved higher. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.6% in New York, while the S&P 500 rose 0.55% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was up about 0.91%.It was the first rise for European stock markets this week, after Trump had previously announced plans to hit Germany, France, the UK, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway and Finland withfresh tariffsfrom 1 February until an agreement was reached for the US to buy Greenland.The president onlywithdrew his threat of using military forceto gain Greenland on Wednesday during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Later on Wednesday he posted on the social network he owns thathe would not impose the tariffsafter claiming to have reached an unspecified deal with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte.Graphic showing movement of the markets before and after Trump’s speechRichard Hunter, the head of markets at the trading platform Interactive Investor, said it was “the return of the Taco trade”.Global stock markets fell heavilyat the start of the week, but US share prices rebounded on Wednesday afternoon in New York.Neil Wilson, a strategist at Saxo, said: “From the market point of view, it’s the classic Taco trade. The pivot has left markets buoyant as the very real threat of a trade war has receded.”Jim Reid, the head of macro and thematic research at Deutsche Bank, said the moves were a “big relief rally as investors priced out escalatory scenarios, with financial stress easing across multiple asset classes”.However, Reid noted that the S&P 500 and the US dollar remained weaker than they were on Friday.Reid said investors also took heart from the start of the supreme court case intoTrump’s attempted removal of Lisa Cookfrom the board of governors of the Federal Reserve. The allegations against Cook are widely seen as part of Trump’s attempt to force the central bank to lower interest rates. However, conservative justices who have previously backed the White House’s positionsappeared sceptical of some of the administration’s arguments.The US dollar was flat against the euro and the pound on Thursday morning in London. One euro bought $1.1689, while a pound bought $1.3427.Gold has served as a haven for investors at a time when many have questioned the long-term attractiveness of US assets. Spot gold prices were flat at $4,833 a troy ounce, near record highs.Lee Hardman, a senior currency analyst at the investment bank MUFG, said: “Market participants have expressed initial relief that the threat of US military action or tariffs is off the table at least for now, although will remain wary that they could return if talks don’t progress as President Trump desires in the coming weeks and months.“Avoiding a tit-for-tat trade war is a positive development for the global growth outlook and supports our outlook for stronger growth this year.”Explore more on these topicsStock marketsTrump tariffsGreenlandDonald TrumpDavos 2026TariffsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Her Eras tour was the highest grossing in history, sparking anestimated$5bn in direct consumer spending across the US. But now another musical phenomenon is preparing to sweep through North America – and economists expect it will generate tens of billions of dollars in economic activity along the way.K-pop sensation BTS will embark this year on their largesttouryet, spanning 34 regions across five continents, ending a hiatus due to mandatory military service that lasted almost four years.“TheBTStour will be the event of the year,” Timothy Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University, said. “Every stop is going to see a boost in tourism, hotel occupancy, and economic activity to an extraordinary degree that might be even bigger than Taylor Swift.”BTS named their new album Arirang. What is so striking about their choice?Read moreThe first US stop is Tampa, Florida, on 15 April. Tickets have yet to go on sale, but that has not stopped fans like Leslie Huynh, 28, from booking up flights and hotels.“It’s a meme at this point that once BTS announces a tour, you just book hotels and flights first and tickets will somehow appear whether that is resale or not,” she said. “I consider BTS to be a very expensive hobby of mine – like, they are what I spend my money on.”Huynh, a film equipment rentals associate based in New York, hopes to attend 11 cities on the tour, catching 22 shows along the way. She expects to spend at least $6,000.When she travels for a concert, Huynh explores the city and ventures on a “BTS pilgrimage”, hitting up spots the boyband has visited, such as restaurants or tourist attractions.“BTS has changed my life, and I hold them so near to my heart,” she said, acknowledging that this might sound dramatic. “They are genuinely a reason to wake up when you don’t feel like it. They are something to look forward to, especially with this tour.”Economists say BTS fans, known as Army, share similar traits with Swifties: loyalty, age demographic and a willingness to spend. But there’s one key difference.“BTS fans are much more passionate and committed than western artists’ fans,” Seoyoung Kwon, an economic researcher at Yonsei University, said. “Especially given that BTS have not toured in so long, many BTS fans are willing to go the extra mile and attend concerts not just in their [home] country, but in other countries and cities as well.”The group’s most recent tour in 2021, Permission to Dance, featured just three cities and 12 shows total. Four nights in Los Angelesreportedlygenerated over $100m for the local economy, while Las Vegas was estimated to have picked up $160m in revenue, figures that the upcoming 79-show tour is expected to multiply many times over.Nearly three in five gen Z and millennials are willing to travel more than 50 miles for concerts, according to a 2024 Bread Financialsurvey. Non-local attendersspendabout 3.4 times their ticket cost on traveling and tourism expenses in the local economy.But Michael Mariano, head of economic development at Tourism Economics, emphasized: “These average figures aren’t applicable to BTS. They will well surpass these numbers, and I honestly don’t think it’s possible to understand how big this tour can be.”This combination of factors – mass following, high demand, and willingness to travel – has created perfect conditions for BTS’s most impactful tour yet, economists say.“With BTS, it’s not just a concert,” Cailey Merulla, a content strategist in New Jersey, said with a wide smile. She plans to attend six shows across three different US cities during the upcoming tour.“BTS got me through the worst parts of my life and they are an unconditional source of happiness,” added Merulla, 25. “I genuinely don’t know where I would be without them so I try to see them any chance I get.”Like Huynh, Merulla plans to build a vacation itinerary around the concert and pop-up events to connect with fellow fans. She also hopes to meet up with friends flying in from the UK for the shows in East Rutherford, New Jersey.“Not only are the boys born performers and the whole show is spectacle, but I often meet friends I would’ve never met had it not been for a concert,” Merulla laughed. “Traveling for BTS is always a no-brainer for me.”She will not be alone, according to tourism experts.“The tour brings some much needed good news for the US in a time where US tourism is declining,” Richie Karaburun, professor of hospitality and tourism at the New York University, said. “It’s the trickle-down effect, and that is what expands the potential economic reach of this BTS tour.”Calkins, at Northwestern University, explained that an initial splurge on concert tickets typically causes a ripple effect. Concertgoers become tourists, and boost the local economy.“These events don’t just bring people to a city – they showcase the city to the world,” he said. “The BTS tour is an opportunity for cities to enhance their brand and attract more people in a way that’s hard to replicate through traditional marketing.”Fan-organized events and pop-up vendors are likely to increase economic impact of the BTS tour beyond that of the Eras tour, according to Karaburun. “These events are very specific toK-popfanbases,” he said. “The overlapping pop-ups with the tour is going to be a phenomenal opportunity for small businesses and many entrepreneurs at large.”Small businesses are already mobilizing. Cherry Benyasri, 30, and her sister Neon, 28, run a K-pop inspired clothing brand called Ordinary Affair. They see the BTS tour as an opportunity for promotion and events aligning with the LA shows.“We are running off of the hype and excitement of BTS’s comeback for a new product launch soon,” Cherry said. “Compared to the time BTS were away and now, you can feel Army’s excitement and they are showing up stronger than before.”Jaerim Choi, professor of economics at Yonsei University, sees the tour as part of a sustained expansion of Korean consumer goods in the US market. Last year, the USimportedmore than $2bn in Korean beauty products, up 34% from 2024, driven by K-pop’s cultural influence, according toresearchby Kwon and Choi.“This is much bigger than concerts,” Choi said. “This BTS tour will only accelerate the Korean boom. It’s not just short-term economic gain. It’s expanding the entire Korean consumer market in the US for the long horizon.”The scope and scale of this tour remains to be determined, with BTS already hinting that more dates will be unveiled. “They don’t have to worry about demand,” said Mariano. “It’s guaranteed fans will show up.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessBTSK-popPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Had he been injured whilesparring in the boxing ring? Had he injured himself while working out in the gym? Did he simply, some wondered, want to avoid looking Donald Trump in the eye?Few could have blamed Macron for channelling Tom Cruise in a mission impossible to neutralise the US president’s plan to take over Greenland andimpose 200% trade tariffs on French wine and champagne. Some, like the communication specialist Philippe Moreau Chevrolet, saw the president’s decision to wear the French-made eyewear as symbolic in the context of France’s strained relations with the US.The real reason was more prosaic: Macron was stylishly disguising a subconjunctival haemorrhage, a burst blood vessel in his right eye – a condition he described as “totally benign”.But even he was not immune to cliches. Addressing French troops at a military event last week, Macron had described the problem as “l’oeil du tigre” (the eye of the tiger). The comment referenced the 1982 song by the rock band Survivor used in the boxing film Rocky III starring Sylvester Stallone. For those too young to get the reference, it was a “mark of determination”, he added.View image in fullscreenThe sunglasses prompted rumours that the French president may have been injured in the boxing ring.Photograph: Soazig de la Moissonnière/Présidence de la RépubliqueFor the artisan workers atMaison Henry Jullienin the département of Jura in eastern France, where glasses have been made for more than 100 years, it was publicity impossible to buy.Stefano Fulchir, the president of iVision Tech, the Italian company that owns Henry Jullien, said the first he knew of the presidential endorsement was when French opticians rang him to say: “The president’s wearing our glasses!” When news spread, the company website crashed for most of the day.“My first reaction can be summed up in three letters: wow! It has not been a typical day. I feel very honoured that the president is wearing our glasses,” he said.Macron’s office had contacted the company in 2024 to buy a pair of €659 Pacific S 01 Double Gold sunglasses as a diplomatic gift during the G20 summit and a second pair for himself, he said.“I said I would be happy to send him a pair but they said no. He did not accept them as a gift, but wanted to purchase them personally. The French president paid a lot of attention to whether the glasses were entirely made inFrance.”View image in fullscreenHenry Jullien’s Pacific sunglasses, which were worn by Macron in Switzerland.Photograph: Henry JullieniVision acquired Henry Jullien, founded in 1921, in 2023. Fulchir said the team of 10 staff at the factory at Lons-le-Saunier, north of Geneva, produced about 1,000 of the sunglasses worn by Macron a year.The glasses are hand assembled and made using what iVision calls an “ancient technique”, where gold is bonded rather than plated to the base metal, making it harder wearing. The blue-tinted UV lenses are produced byDalloz,another Jura-based company.Fulchir said the glasses were available at opticians around the world and even in war-ravaged Ukraine, but the company had yet to find a UK distributor.“This is not ordinary eyewear; it’s a luxury product that won’t break after two years and that can be used for a long time. It’s an investment, like jewellery, like a watch,” he said.Jimmy Mohamed, a medical doctor and media commentator, told the French broadcaster RTL that he believed Macron had worn the sunglasses for “aesthetic reasons”. “The glasses protect his image, but not really his eye,” Mohamed said.Explore more on these topicsEmmanuel MacronFranceDavosDavos 2026newsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, adriver was killedand 37 people injured when a train was derailed by the collapse of a retaining wall near Gelida in Catalonia.A number of people were also lightly injured on Thursday when a commuter train in the south-eastern region of Murcia crashed into a crane. Authorities said the incident was caused by “the intrusion … of a crane not belonging to the railway operation”, and the train was not derailed or overturned.The accidents in Adamuz and Gelida led the Spanish railway drivers’ union Semaf to announce industrial action. They have also prompted a stoppage by drivers that has shut down Catalonia’s regional rail services, affecting about 400,000 travellers.The union said three days of strikes would be held from 9 to 11 February, saying the action was “the only legal avenue left for workers to demand the restoration of safety standards on the railway system and, consequently, guarantee the safety of both railway professionals and passengers”.Semaf called for the relevant authorities to ensure people’s safety by addressing the “numerous reports” on poor track conditions it said had gone “unanswered and inactive for months, or even years”.It added: “The serious accidents in Adamuz and Gelida, both of which resulted in people losing their lives, represent a turning point in demanding that all necessary actions be taken to guarantee the safety of railway operations.”Spain’s transport minister, Óscar Puente, said he understood drivers’ concerns but hoped the strikes could be averted, and he said the stoppage in Catalonia needed to end. He has stressed that the two accidents were “completely unrelated”. The Gelida incident is thought to have been caused by heavy rainfall.“This is a very difficult week,” hetold Catalunya Ràdioon Thursday morning. “We need to remain calm and get this where it needs to be. Two terrible incidents have occurred in a very short space of time, and I believe that is significantly impacting the morale of the train drivers. I hope the situation will be resolved soon.”View image in fullscreenRemoval work continues on Thursday at the scene of the crash near Adamuz.Photograph: Susana Vera/ReutersInvestigators are continuing to examine the crash site in Adamuz and the wreckage of the two trains. The accident happened at 7.40pm on Sunday when a high-speed train travelling from Málaga to Madrid derailed, crossing on to another track where it hit an oncoming train travelling from Madrid to Huelva.Media reports suggest investigators are focusing on a 30cm (12in) crack in the track at the accident site.“There’s an initial point where the derailment is believed to have occurred,” Puente told the radio network Cadena Ser on Monday night. “Now we have to determine if it’s the cause or the consequence. It’s not a trivial matter, and it won’t be quick or easy. We’ll have to send the track to the lab; we have to determine what happened. At this point, nothing can be ruled out.”Puente saidmarks had been foundon the wheels of the first five carriages of the high-speed train, and on the wheels of other trains that had travelled along the same stretch of track before the derailment.“The question now is how those marks appeared,” the minister told the TV channel Telecinco. “Was there something on the tracks, or was the track itself beginning to break down? At this point, it’s not possible to draw any conclusions about what caused those marks.”Spain’s efforts to mourn the dead have been marred by familiar political squabbles. A spokesperson for the far-right Vox party said the Adamuz tragedy was proof of the decline of the country’s once-great rail services.“All Spaniards can see with their own eyes that it’s not safe to travel and that the damage is getting worse by the day,” Pepa Millán said, adding: “Spaniards are scared to get on a train.”Vox’s leader, Santiago Abascal, has attempted to link the Adamuz accident to theseries of corruption allegationsthat have enveloped the socialist-led government. “Corruption destroys confidence in our institutions,” he said. “And corruption kills.”The conservative People’s party (PP) called for Puente, who has made numerous media appearances over the past few days, to provide “absolute transparency”.“The minister has a knack for talking,” said the PP infrastructure spokesperson, Juan Bravo. “But it’s time for him to offer explanations and not spend two hours saying nothing.”The government’s spokesperson, Elma Saiz, said Abascal’s comments were abhorrent. “Given the two tragic nights we’ve just endured, with dozens of injured still hospitalised and not all the bodies recovered, Abascal’s attitude is despicable,” she said. “Using tragedy and fear to generate chaos and distrust is an anti-democratic and inhumane act.”Explore more on these topicsSpainTrain crashesRail transportEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He pointed to the collards, a burst of green in the winter cold, and the chickens, with their eggs. “If you ain’t lazy, you can live good here,” he said, referring to Sapelo Island off the coast of southernGeorgia.Then he waved in a broad circle, pointing out the nearby modest homes of family members, all bearing the same last name as him, which Grovner, who is 70, says stretches nine generations back on Hogg Hummock.The community is home to theGullah Geecheepeople, descendants of enslaved west Africans who worked on cotton, indigo and rice plantations from North Carolina to Florida. In places like South Carolina’sHilton Head Island, the Gullah Geechee population was nearly wiped out by development starting in the 1960s.On Sapelo Island, post-enslavement, freed Black folks were granted land in Hogg Hummock in part because it was seen as marshy and less desirable than the rest of the island. It is the only remaining sea island community ofGullah Geecheepeople in Georgia.View image in fullscreen‘On Sapelo Island, post-enslavement, freed Black folks were granted land in Hogg Hummock in part because it was seen as marshy and less desirable.’Photograph: Joshua Parks/The Guardian“All that’s family,” Grovner summed up. “All those people who want to build houses here ain’t gonna close me in.”Outsiders building large vacation houses was what was at stake in Tuesday’s election in McIntosh county, where Sapelo is located – only the second citizen referendum on a county plan or policy in Georgia history. (Nearby Camden county voters defeated a county plan to build a rocket-launching pad through a referendum in2022.)The referendum, brought about after more than 2,000 registered voters in the county signed petitions, allowed residents to vote on whether they were for or against a zoning amendment increasing the amount of residential square footage permitted in Hogg Hummock from 1,400 to 3,000.Unofficial results released on Tuesday evening showed that nearly 85% of 1,869 county voters opposed the zoning increase.Allowing larger houses to be built on the island would have opened the door to developers – “all those people” Grovner named – which then would raise taxes, making it harder for Gullah Geechee people to continue living on Sapelo, and potentially changing the island’s cultural and environmental landscape forever.The number of Gullah Geechee people living on Sapelo has dwindled to between 30 and 40 residents, down from about 500 in theearly 20th century. Dozens of the residents’ children and other family members have moved to the mainland over time. Nonetheless, many of these family members maintain ties to the island; some still own property and plan on retiring there.“Every county in the state of Georgia is looking at” Tuesday’s results, said Kathleen Russell, editor of theDarien News– because any county’s residents can now mount a referendum and challenge zoning rules, she said.The referendum made history in the region as well, as referendums “are incredibly rare in the majority of the south”, said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, executive director of theBallot Initiative Strategy Center. The reason: “States where formerly enslaved people lived, the state governments did not want those people to exercise their power,” Fields Figueredo said.View image in fullscreen‘Outsiders building large vacation houses was what was at stake in Tuesday’s election.’Photograph: Joshua Parks/The GuardianThe ability to stage a referendum inGeorgiacomes from provisions in the state’s constitution. First, a certain percentage of a county’s registered voters signs a petition indicating they want to vote on a policy from the county’s elected representatives. The percentage varies based on the county’s population.Once the threshold of confirmed signatures is reached and a referendum is authorized, it is “a form of holding power accountable, where systems of governance are challenged”, said Fields Figueredo.The Gullah Geechee people who were leading the effort to hold the referendum first had to defeat the county’s legal challenges, based on assertions that zoning rules weren’t covered by language in the state’s constitution. It took aSeptemberstate supreme court decision to give the green light to Tuesday’s election.The Guardian spoke to a handful of the nearly 1,000 county residents who cast ballots during a two-week early voting period ending Friday. All had ties to Sapelo Island and Hogg Hummock, and felt strongly about the need to protect the community from unchecked development.The unspoiled qualities that allow Gullah Geechee people to live close to nature also make the island a prime location for natural science; in the 1950s, Sapelo was the site of foundational research in the nascent field of ecology.After casting his ballot on Thursday, Nick Macías described Sapelo as “an ecologically important island you don’t find anywhere in the world”. Macías, who works as assistant operations director at the island’sUniversity of Georgia Marine Institute, pointed out that Sapelo was the only Georgia sea island with healthy communities of marsh grass – a keystone species, or one that other animals and plants in an ecosystem depend on for survival.Allowing larger houses and increased development in Hogg Hummock “would put stress on the carbon footprint” of the island and displace Gullah Geechee people, he said: “When it comes to preserving the [Gullah Geechee] culture, it comes down to the next generation being able to live there.”Also voting last week, Samuel – who didn’t want his last name used – had gotten off his job early as a trucker to cast a ballot. He has ties to Hogg Hummock through his wife, who has family there. “It’s a unique place,” he said. “You go there … and they treat you like family. They take you in.”The trucker remembers first visiting as a teenager. “They showed me medicine for toothaches, using plants,” he said. As for the community’s ongoing struggles, he said, “I’ll fight for it till the end. They deserve it. It’s their place.”One of Ire Gene Grovner’s relatives in Hogg Hummock is his brother, Bobby Gene Grovner. He’s renovating his home on the island, with plans of leaving it to his two daughters. “These ones who come with a pocketful of money, it ain’t gonna work,” he said, referring to developers with interest in the community’s land.View image in fullscreenGeorge Grovner, a resident of the Hogg Hummock community on Sapelo Island, during a meeting of McIntosh county commissioners on 12 September 2023 in Darien, Georgia.Photograph: Russ Bynum/APStill, Bobby Gene, who turns 67 later this month, said “it’s tiring” to have to fight in courtrooms and government halls for his community.“I ain’t got but 40 years left!” he said, laughing.His brother Ire Gene is involved in another unresolved legal battle, laying claim to several dozen acres of land that a 2024 lawsuit asserts was taken from his family by the state of Georgia in nearby Raccoon Bluff, a 698-acre plot of land on the island formerly inhabited by Gullah Geechee people. The lawsuit includes land deed records in Grovner’s family dating to 1875.An ongoingcaseinvolving the subject of Tuesday’s referendum, filed by theSouthern Poverty Law Center, asserts that the proposed zoning amendment was discriminatory. “The people in [Hogg Hummock] feel like they’ve been shut out,” said the SPLC attorney Miriam Gutman. “[They] want to pass their land onto their children and grandchildren. They want to be part of the conversation” about the community’s future, she said.But even the immediate future after Tuesday’s result is unclear, as the McIntosh county attorney, Adam Poppell, recently stated that voters rejecting the county’s attempt to increase the maximum square footage allowed on the island doesn’t mean conditions will revert to what they were before: a limit of 1,400 sq ft. Instead, Poppell said, the election’s result leaves Hogg Hummock with “no zoning” – meaning anything could be built.The county attorney did not answer a request for comment.Dana Braun, attorney for the Hogg Hummock residents who mounted the referendum effort, said another lawsuit would be likely if the county insists on Poppell’s interpretation of where things stand. “The county apparently loves paying lawyers for losing battles,” he said.After cleaning off his knife and preparing the raccoon on Friday, Ire Gene turned to face the chicken pens and the morning’s eggs. His position on the future of Hogg Hummock: “I ain’t planning on goin’ nowhere.”Explore more on these topicsGullah GeecheeCotton Capital: ongoing seriesGeorgiaGentrificationRaceSlaveryHousingCommunitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Future Tennis document is extremely critical of the sport’s existing structure and governance framework, saying that “professional tennis has underperformed its potential for years”, as well as referring to “deeper structural issues: a fragmented yet suppressive governance model, a confusing and inaccessible calendar for fans, and player compensation artificially capped and well below industry peers”.The PTPA’s proposed solution is a new three-tiered professional structure topped by the Pinnacle Tour, which in addition to a 50% increase would offer equal prize money to men and women, with top 100 players guaranteed to receive $1m (£745,000) in the first year, rising to $2.3m after 10 years. Future Tennis also envisages the sport uniting under a single-entity governing body – there are three in the form of the ATP, WTA and International Tennis Federation – but there are no details on how to bring that about.The PTPA declined to comment when contacted.Explore more on these topicsTennisNovak DjokovicnewsShareReuse this content"

Here are the factors that will help decide the resultOliver ConnollyThu 22 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 05.06 ESTShareLos Angeles Rams: Protection for Matthew StaffordA month ago, the Rams looked like a near-complete team. Special teams aside, they had answers everywhere. Coaching. Quarterback. Playmakers. A defense that could steal a game if necessary. They’re still a formidable opponent, but cracks have started to emerge.The Ramsbarely survived their divisional round gameagainst the Chicago Bears, and Sean McVay and Matthew Stafford spent the aftermath conducting a public inquest into their own performance. McVayadmittedhe had been guilty of “bad coaching” against the Bears. Stafford acknowledged he needs to play better. Neither was wrong. And yet, in the game’s final moments, Stafford still delivered the throws that mattered, and the Rams escaped thanks to their defense creating adecisive turnover.McVay, belatedly, rediscovered the rushing game against the Bears. He ran the ball 19 times in the fourth quarter and overtime after barely doing so for three quarters. It was less an adjustment than a confession: McVay had been too pass-centric. His gameplan was wrong. And that has been the Rams’ greatest strength on offense this season: they can switch up their strategy during a game. But their two playoff games have shown fractures within the offense.Stafford is not playing well. Against Chicago, he looked rattled and confused as the Bears sent every manner of blitz his way. He made late – and poor – decisions, offering the ball up for grabs or refusing to let it go. On Sunday, he had 11 off-target throws, according to ESPN, his most ever in a playoff game. More than that, he looked uncomfortable in the pocket against a blah Bears pass-rush, moving into pressure and struggling when pushed off his spot. It’s true that McVay didn’t give him enough answers, but Stafford is a limited player at this stage of his career when players are not open by design and he’s forced to create on the fly.Stafford is taking significantly more sacks in the postseason than he did in the regular season. His offensive line has allowed four times as many free runners on the quarterback as it did before the playoffs. To win it all, the Rams will have to get past relentless pass rushes.First up is the sternest test. It’s Seattle, on the road. The Seahawks are a tough matchup for anyone. They are particularly tough for the Rams. For as flexible as McVay and Stafford can be on offense, the Seahawks can match them. It will fall on the offensive line, McVay’s play calling, and the team’s protection plan to keep Stafford clean. No team creates as much confusion or crafts as many free runners as the Seahawks. They force the offensive line to communicate and roll out pressure from every conceivable angle.The Rams can limit some of the blows to Stafford with their run game. They led the league in rush success rate this season and were the only team to crack 50%. In both playoff games, it’s the run they’ve turned to when things have been tight. If the Rams’ offensive line can keep Stafford clean and push the Seahawks’ defensive front off the ball, then the game will be in the hands of a great quarterback and his two star receivers.Seattle Seahawks: DefenseAfter hammering the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round, the Seahawks are firm favorites to win the Super Bowl. There are no holes with this team. Sam Darnold, playing through an injured oblique, barely had to do anything against San Francisco. From the opening kickoff, the Seahawks controlled the game and led by three scores at half-time.It’s small margins that often matter in the playoffs, and all those things tilt in Seattle’s direction. They’re running the ball better than at any point this season – and have the No 1 special teams unit in the playoff field.Still, this is a team who flow through their defense. The unit finished the regular season first in EPA/play, and was again dominant against the Niners last week. Everywhere you look, there are game-wreckers: DeMarcus Lawrence, Byron Murphy II, Leonard Williams, Devon Witherspoon and Nick Emmanwori. But it’s the non-household names such as Ty Okada, Uchenna Nwosu, Josh Jobe and Julian Love who push this group from being great to one of the best in the past 26 years. They are violent. They rush the passer. They shut down opposing run games. In coverage, they are tricky to decipher and play with all-out effort.Darnold in the second half of the season may not be at the same level as Stafford or Drake Maye, but his defense is the great equaliser.Denver Broncos: Pass rushBo Nix’s injuryis cruel. He put together the best performance of his young career to beat the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round. Now, he’s done for the season with a broken ankle.Enter Jarrett Stidham, who hasn’t thrown a meaningful pass in two years and has never played in the postseason. At center, Denver could be down to a third-stringer, depending on the health of Alex Forsyth. None of this is ideal, particularly for an offense that lives on its pass protection.If the Broncos are to survive and advance, their pass rush must step up. It ran a little cold against the Bills, but it has been the team’s superpower all season.The Broncos led the league in pressures and sacks in the regular season. Vance Joseph, the team’s defensive coordinator, has become more selective about when he blitzes, but the group almost always gets home when he adds extra spice. When sending five or more pass-rushers this season, the Broncos have a 50% pressure rate. Creating havoc in the backfield and forcing turnovers is the Broncos’ best path forward. They cannot expectStidham to go ona Nick Foles-type run. (He did look good in preseason, Broncos fans!) Edge rusher Nik Bonitto is liable to swing a game on any given snap. He isn’t the most efficient pass rusher, but he is the most explosive remaining in the playoff field. Without timely blitzes and constant pressure from Bonitto, Zach Allen, Malcolm Roach and Jonathan Cooper, the Broncos have no shot.Denver’s defense has been strong all season. It will need to be special on Sunday and, possibly, beyond. Without Nix, the margin is too thin.View image in fullscreenDrake Maye has plenty of thinking to do before Sunday’s game.Photograph: Steven Senne/APNew England Patriots:The good version of Drake MayeThe Patriots werenot dazzling against Houston. They were, however, effective at the right times. Now they are one win away from the Super Bowl. Again.New England’s defense deserves credit. Sure, CJ Stroud threw up on himself last week. But it was the same with the Los Angeles Chargers’ Justin Herbert, whom the Patriots faced the week before. In both games, the Patriots’ defensive line wrecked shop, with the secondary helping out by masking coverage. The offense did enough against the Chargers and Texans. That has been New England’s formula this season. You can point out the favorable path, the injuries to opponents and the fortunate breaks. None of that is wrong. This is not a juggernaut. Then again, neither was the team that shocked the Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI to kick off the Brady-Belichick run.The Patriots’ defense is good, but it is vulnerable. Against the Chargers, the defense conceded a 38% (!) wide-open target rate to receivers, the highest in a playoff game in six seasons. Herbert simply made poor reads and struggled to maintain his composure as his offensive line melted down. Stroud pieced together one of the worst single postseason performances in history, lobbing the ball up to the Pats defense even when he had receivers open. There will be opportunities for Sean Payton and Stidham down the field. And if New England make it to the Super Bowl, the Rams or Seahawks will be a different magnitude of challenge.Which means the decisive plays will be in the hands of their own quarterback. Maye could wind up being the league’s MVP. He has been spectacular all season, and he can create plays out of nothing or rip a defense apart by sticking to the scheme. But he has not been as solid in the playoffs as he was during the regular season. Yes, he’s played two outstanding defenses, but it’s also not getting any easier from here on in.Maye has been at fault for too many negative plays. He has a 50% pressure-to-sack rate in the playoffs and has doubled his turnover-worthy play rate, perPFF. Sure, his offensive line has been beaten up, but he’s also held on to the ball too long. For Maye, that’s usually fine. He can offset those negatives with spectacular throws for chunk yardage. In both playoff games, he has made timely big-time throws – often for scores – to help mitigate the down-to-down struggles.Taking sacks is one thing. Turning it over is something else. In the playoffs, Maye has contracted a vicious case of fumble-itis, coughing up the ball six times in two games. If it’s going to be in his hands to decide a tight contest, he cannot put the ball in harm’s way. If he can be the quarterback he was in the regular season, the Patriots have a good shot at their first championship of the post-Belichick/Brady era.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew England PatriotsLos Angeles RamsSeattle SeahawksDenver BroncosUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the time, police said his death was being investigated as a possible overdose or suicide, and no cause had been made public.Toxicology report says late US chess star Daniel Naroditsky had drugs in his systemRead moreThe medical examiner’s investigation, conducted by Dr James R Lozano and obtained by the Guardian on Thursday, concludes that Naroditsky died from a probablecardiac arrhythmiacaused by undiagnosed systemic sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease that most commonly affects the lungs but can also involve the heart. Methamphetamine and kratom (mitragynine) use were listed as contributing conditions, though the report states that the levels detected were not considered toxic or lethal on their own. The manner of death was ruled an accident.According to the report, postmortem radiographic imaging revealed extensive granulomatous lung disease, findings that are “highly suggestive” of sarcoidosis.Cardiac sarcoidosiscan disrupt the heart’s electrical system and is a known cause of sudden death, sometimes without prior diagnosis or warning symptoms.The medical examiner noted that sudden unexpected death is the presenting manifestation in a significant proportion of cardiac sarcoidosis cases. No autopsy was performed, but investigators said the totality of radiographic, toxicological and circumstantial evidence supported the conclusion.Toxicology testing detected methamphetamine and amphetamine in Naroditsky’s blood, with the amphetamine present as a metabolite of methamphetamine rather than evidence of separate ingestion. Compounds associated withkratom, a plant-based supplement increasingly used for stimulant or pain-relieving effects, were also found. Review of North Carolina prescription records showed no prescriptions for amphetamines or methamphetamine issued to Naroditsky.The report states that there was no evidence of intentional or unintentional overdose, no signs of traumatic injury and no indication of foul play. Investigators said Naroditsky appeared to have died suddenly, without signs of acute distress.Naroditsky was discovered unresponsive on his living room couch by close friends Oleksandr Bortnyk, a fellow grandmaster, and Peter Giannatos, founder of the CharlotteChessCenter, where Naroditsky served as head coach and grandmaster-in-residence. Friends went to check on him after he stopped responding to calls and messages.In the days before his death, Naroditsky had been under intense public scrutiny following cheating allegations made by former world champion Vladimir Kramnik, claims Naroditsky consistently denied. The medical examiner’s report notes that investigators considered stress related to those allegations while evaluating the possibility of overdose or suicide, but ultimately found no evidence to support either.In a statement issued this week, Kramnik expressed condolences to Naroditsky’s family and rejected claims that his conduct contributed to the grandmaster’s death. He said that following Naroditsky’s passing, he and his family were subjected to harassment and death threats, prompting him to consider legal action.“I deeply regret that this profound tragedy was exploited by various individuals and groups to advance their own agendas,” Kramnik said. “There can be no justification for such immoral conduct.”The International Chess Federation (Fide)has said it is reviewingwhether Kramnik should face disciplinary action for public statements made about Naroditsky before and after his death. Potential sanctions include fines or suspension. Fide did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian following the release of the medical examiner’s report.Naroditsky’s death marked a devastating loss for American chess. A prodigy who learned the game as a child in California, he became a grandmaster at 18 and later graduated from Stanford University with a degree in history. Known to fans as “Danya”, he rose to prominence not only for his elite play but for his rare ability to explain the game with clarity, patience and warmth.He was one of the most influential figures of chess’s pandemic-era boom, amassing more than 800,000 followers across YouTube and Twitch through instructional videos and live commentary. He also remained an elite competitor, winning the US Blitz Championship only months before his death.Tributes poured in from across the chess world after his passing. Magnus Carlsen called him “a resource to the chess community”, while Hikaru Nakamura described him as “the best of us”. Fide later announced plans for a memorial award in Naroditsky’s name.Explore more on these topicsChessUS sportsNorth CarolinanewsShareReuse this content"

Football’s hypotheticals cannot be dismissed any more | Nick AmesRead more“When the ball started rolling and the magic started we had virtually no incidents. For the first time in history also, no Brit was arrested during aWorld Cup. Imagine! This is something really, really special,” he said.“So it was a celebration, it was a party, and the next one in the United States, Canada and Mexico will be exactly the same. People want occasions to meet, to come together, to spend time, to celebrate, and this is what we try to give them.”In response to theFifapresident’s comments, the Football Supporters’ Association said: “While we’ve got Mr Infantino‘s attention, we’d like to point out that rather than making cheap jokes about our fans, he should concentrate on making cheap tickets.”Infantino said the finals would be “the greatest celebration of humanity”, despite human rights groups voicing concerns about a number of policies adopted by the Donald Trump administration, and went on to address criticism of ticket prices.Fifa said it had received more than 500 million requests for tickets during the most recent application window which ended on 13 January. The second-cheapest category for the final cost $4,185 (£3,100), with only a tiny percentage available in the cheapest $40 category, leading to intense criticism.“The tickets are not cheap,” he said. “We were hammered. I was hammered, I should say, because of the ticket prices, because they are so expensive. And the main critics were from Germany and England, of course. Now, No 1 in ticket requests is the US. No 2, Germany, No 3, England, because everyone wants to come and to participate.”Fifa has not released details of how the demand for tickets is spread between the 104 matches or cost categories, but Infantino confidently stated: “Every match will be sold out.”He said that because of Fifa’s ticket resale platform, “those tickets will probably be resold at even higher prices”.He added: “This is incredible, but it shows really the impact that it has. To give you another number, to compare this in 100 years of World Cup history, Fifa has sold around 50 million tickets in total. For this World Cup, in these four weeks we have the request for 1,000 years of World Cups at once.“This is unique, it’s incredible, but I think it shows really that people have trust in the organisation, probably trust in Fifa as well. Trust in Canada, Mexico, the United States. They want to travel. They want to go.”Infantino said reports that fans from certain countries could be denied visas to enter the United States were “not true”.Spectators from Haiti, Iran and Senegal in particular are expected to struggle to be granted entry to the US, but Infantino said: “The United States, Canada and Mexico will welcome the world next summer, and this is what we are looking forward to.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026Gianni InfantinoWorld CupFifaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

As all cameras pointed directly at the players’ entrance, it was not difficult to understand why they were there.A day earlier, Naomi Osaka had produced one of the enduring images of the 2026 Australian Open, marching on to Rod Laver Arena inan outfit inspired by a jellyfish. This time, before her gritty, contentious 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 second-round win over Sorana Cirstea, she left the hat and veil back in the locker room.Naomi Osaka’s jellyfish-inspired outfit steals the show at Australian OpenRead moreThe reaction to Osaka’s sartorial choices has been fascinating. Alongside the viral social media posts and criticisms of her fashion instincts, tennis’s old guard have clutched tightly to their pearls. Boris Becker, for example, described Osaka’s outfit as “iconic” but with a caveat. “There is also a contradiction: on the one hand, she doesn’t want to be under so much pressure, she doesn’t want to be in the public eye and in the media so much – and then she comes on to centre court in an outfit like that,” he said on TNT Sports.This has been a common refrain whenever Osaka makes any kind of eye-catching decision, a reference to herrefusal to participate in post-match press conferencesat the French Open in 2021. Osaka later revealed that she had been struggling with depression. For many, that incident determined their outlook on the player. In 125 matches she has played since the 2021 French Open, however, she has participated in media briefings after nearly every one. Five years is a long time and that one incident says little about Osaka at 28 years old.Five years is also a long time between major titles. Osaka, whose last grand slam victorycame at the 2021 Australian Open, is here again trying to compete among the best. After a difficult few years, herrun to the semi-finals of the US Openlast year, after her final at the WTA 1000 event in Canada, placed her back in the top 20 and renewed her hopes of winning a fifth slam title.However, her win against Cirstea, a wily 35-year-old who will retire this year, was hardly encouraging for her prospects in Melbourne. Osaka found herself in a third set because she was erratic from the baseline and she struggled with an apparent abdominal problem, taking an off-court medical timeout as her serve speeds fell.There were, however, also staccato glimpses of her greatness, particularly with the destructive, clean shotmaking later in the final set, which allowed her to close out the victory. The one-dimensional nature of Osaka’s ultra-offensive game has been exposed on many occasions in recent years, but she remains a ball striker of rare quality and only a couple of players can match her shotmaking brilliance.View image in fullscreenNaomi Osaka of Japan walks on to court for her second round match minus the statement hat, veil and umbrella she sported for her Melbourne opener.Photograph: Dita Alangkara/APOsaka’s clothes do say a lot about the contradiction at the heart of her personality. Off the court, Osaka is introverted and reserved but she is expressive through her competitive spirit on the court and her fashion.“I feel like when I step on the court, I’m not the me that you’re talking to right now,” she said as she addressed the source of contention at the end of her victory over Cirstea. “I would never yell: ‘C’mon’ that loud in a normal setting. I almost feel like I’m a Barbie that dresses up and goes on the court and does something. When I come back in the locker room is when I’m like my true quiet Naomi.”On Margaret Court Arena, Osaka’s competitive spirit took over. At 4-2, 30-30, a cheer of “C’mon” from Osaka to herself after a missed serve from Cirstea prompted the Romanian to complain to the umpire, Kelly Rask, arguing that Osaka’s call had hindered her. Rask explained that Osaka had not broken any rules.Osaka won the subsequent two points to secure her second service break and she punctuated both points with loud, pointed screams across the net. A cold post-match handshake from Cirstea followed and the Romanian did not hesitate to offer her opinion at the net: “You have been playing on the tour for so long, you have no idea what fair play is,” she said.During her on-court interview, an upset Osaka was asked about how she won the match. She responded: “Apparently a lot of ‘C’mons’ that she was angry about, but whatever.”Osaka was more level-headed an hour later, admitting that Cirstea’sinitial commentsto the umpireprovided her with extra motivation to close out the victory: “I’m not a person that reacts well to being casually disrespected,” she said.However, she also took a conciliatory tone: “I’ve never been involved in something like this before, so I don’t know if we’re supposed to leave it on the court and be like: ‘Hey, how you doing?’ I’m a little confused.“I guess that emotions were very high for her. I also want to apologise. I think the first couple of things that I said on the court were disrespectful. I don’t like disrespecting people. That’s not what I do. If she wants to talk about it, then yeah. But when I’m pumping myself up, in my head I’m not like: ‘OK, now I’m going to distract the other person.’ It’s purely for me, so …”The next challenge for Osaka in round three will be Maddison Inglis, the last Australian woman left in the draw, and an unsympathetic crowd cheering for her demise. A potential meeting with Iga Swiatek, the second seed, looms in the fourth round.Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenNaomi OsakaTennisAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Bodø/Glimt’s stadium is more than 700 miles from Oslo but the prime minister’s long journey proved well worth it.Bodø beating Manchester City3-1, a first-ever win in the group stage, was Norway’s greatest club football triumph since Rosenborg beat – and knocked out – mighty Milan from the competition in December 1996.This was no dogged, backs-against-the-walls affair. Manager Kjetil Knutsen’s team played fantastic, off-the-cuff football, full of energy intaking downPep Guardiola’s stars. Jens Petter Hauge’s second goal, his team’s third, was a thing of beauty.City being so careworn – they are the only Premier League outfit not in the group stage top eight – was a factor but Guardiola was happy to hand credit to the victors.“The same manager for the past six, seven years, the same players, and that gives consistency in what they have to do, so full respect,” he said. Knutsen was a candidate for the Celtic job that went to Wilfried Nancy, a role now being looked after by Martin O’Neill on an interim basis after Nancy’struncated tenure. That Celtic opportunity may come up again soon. City’s players, meanwhile, promised to refund fans who made the trip.Arne Slot praises ‘professional’ Salah after comfortable Liverpool winRead moreAfter Internazionale werestrong-armedby Arsenal to a 3-1 defeat in Italy, Inter coach Cristian Chivu hailed the team who top the table.“We knew this was one of the best teams in Europe,” he said. “They’re first without losing. The depth is important. They have quality, pace, intensity, individual players. In my opinion,Arsenalwith Bayern Munich are the two best teams for the moment.”With a timely goal scored by Viktor Gyökeres and Gabriel Jesus coming back to the boil with a double, the Gunners’ forwards found San Siro easier than they have the Premier League. Similar went for Tottenham, Liverpool and Newcastle, all of whom won handily this matchday but have been treading water domestically.Despite Harry Kane missing a penalty, Bayern look set for second place in the table. It will take a huge goal difference swing on the final matchday next week to unseat Arsenal from top spot.The USMNT’s Weston McKennie has become Juventus’s talisman, scoring his team’s second as they beat Benfica 2-0, his third goal in his last threeChampions Leagueoutings.McKennie scored his third goal of 2026 as Juve clinched qualification for the knockouts. Using Jonathan David as a decoy, McKennie clattered home their second. Khéphren Thuram scored a similar opener, with David again involved. That left José Mourinho’s Benfica with only a slim chance of making the top 24 whileJuventus, who face a huge game with Napoli this weekend, must beat Monaco for a chance of making the top eight.McKennie, out of contract this summer, is likely to attract several takers. “We believe in the concept,” he said of Luciano Spalletti’s coaching, as he has slowly revived Juventus’s fortunes.Spalletti was seen slapping Loïs Openda before sending him on as sub – not a pretty sight. “You have to wake up,” he was seen to say.55:52Why are English teams dominating the Champions League?

He clearly enjoys Premier League opposition, having scored twice against Tottenham. Much-scouted, linked with Manchester United in the past as well as Brentford more recently, being back home brings the best out of him.They said it“There’s two ways you can take it: you can cry about it and moan, or send a lawyer, or you can just roll with it and enjoy it. It was a bit of a joke back to the fans and the people who say whatever they want. I know the truth, I know what really goes on in my personal life, I know what I give to the game and the team. All the outside noise doesn’t really matter but it’s nice to have a bit of a joke.” – Jude Bellingham explains his celebratory mime after scoring inReal Madrid’s 6-1 defeat of Monaco.

It can’t be easy when you’re under that pressure. His tactics were spot on tonight. He deserves a lot of praise and credit. He needs to stop mentioning low blocks. Low blocks have been happening against Liverpool since I was playing. That’s just the way it is.”After Arne Slot’s team won at Marseille, he got partial backing on TNT’s UK broadcast from club legend Steven Gerrard, subject of rumours – which he denied – that he may assume an interim role if Slot is removed.Looking aheadParis Saint-Germain needed the extra playoff round last season and ended up champions. Might history repeat itself? Defeat on Tuesday to Sporting Lisbon meant the holders’ top-eight position is in jeopardy. PSG must beat Newcastle next week, while Sporting travel to Athletic Bilbao. Inter, who visit Borussia Dortmund in the final round and are locked on 12 points with Juventus, will be among those hoping for a slip.Five teams enter the final round of matches on eight points, with Napoli, Copenhagen and Club Brugge outside the top 24. PSV, Athletic Bilbao and Olympiakos are within the cutoff. Napoli, who have continued Antonio Conte’s poor record in the competition and kick off in 25th, host his former club, Chelsea. Olympiakos, in 24th, face Ajax, who beat Villarreal this week, a second successive win in Europe and some welcome relief from their domestic wobbles. On six points, Ajax have only an outside chance.Qarabag ended Eintracht Frankfurt’s hopes with Behlul Mustafazade scoring a 94th-minute winner in Baku that placed destiny and a knockout place within the hands of Gurban Gurbanov’s team. They can round off a historic campaign with a positive result at Anfield.

But the Villa manager, Unai Emery, was involved in a touchline spat with Youri Tielemans after the midfielder was substituted in stoppage time.Villa’s win was their sixth from seven European matches this season and ended Fenerbahce’s unbeaten home record. Sancho opened his account in Villa colours to put the visitors in the driving seat amid a loud Sukru Saracoglu Stadium atmosphere.Braga v Nottingham Forest, Rangers v Ludogorets, and more: Europa League – liveRead moreThe Premier League side had to deal with several injury problems this week and their mettle was more than tested in the second half as their goalkeeper Marco Bizot stepped up in the absence of Emi Martínez to make eight saves to preserve their lead.Emery, who appeared to shove Tielemans as the Belgian left the pitch, appeared to laugh off the incident saying: “He’s my son. He’s my son.”Morgan Rogers had a goal scrubbed out for offside but Villa had a reprieve themselves when Kerem Akturkoglu thought he had equalised, only for the video assistant referee to intervene again.Villa looked lively from the off, Rogers’ back-heel fed Ollie Watkins but his goalbound effort was blocked behind by Mert Muldur in their first real opening on goal.The visitors did go ahead, though, in the 25th minute. Some neat play ended at the feet of Matty Cash, whose cross flicked off the head of Ismail Yuksek and on to the head of Sancho, who nodded the ball beyond Ederson.View image in fullscreenJadon Sancho beats Fenerbahce’s Ederson with a header to score his first goal for Aston Villa.Photograph: Murad Sezer/ReutersVilla ought to have doubled their advantage before the break. Rogers found Sancho, who sat a couple of defenders down and thought he would roll it into an empty goal but Milan Skriniar produced a heroic block.Bizot produced a stunning save to keep Villa’s lead intact as he rushed out to stop the substitute Talisca from point-blank range.Villa thought they got their second when Rogers bundled one over the line but Sancho fractionally mistimed his run before squaring it to his teammate.It was then Fenerbahce’s turn to have a goal chalked off through VAR as Akturkoglu saw an initial effort saved by Bizot and he tucked in the rebound, but Jhon Durán was shown to be offside in the buildup as Villa held on for the win.Emery was pleased to secure progress to the last 16 and said: “Europa League is important for us and we have got in the top eight.“Building the team with some circumstances not helping us but next week we can finish the transfer window and hopefully we can get everything we need to complete the squad for the competitions we have.”Martin O’Neill hailed his team’s spirit after 10-manCelticlost a two-goal half-time lead but held on for what could be a precious point inBologna.Reo Hatate opened the scoring early on before receiving two yellow cards in three minutes. Auston Trusty doubled Celtic’s lead but O’Neill’s side came under sustained pressure after the interval and goals from Thijs Dallinga and Jonathan Rowe brought Bologna level.Although the Italian side managed 37 attempts at goal in total, both teams had chances to win it before the game finished 2-2.The result puts Celtic on eight points before their final game against already eliminated Utrecht at Parkhead next week. A win should ensure Celtic qualify for the playoff round.Hatate put Celtic ahead in the sixth minute after a gift from the Bologna goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski, who passed the ball straight to centre-forward Daizen Maeda. The Japan forward squared for his compatriot to roll into an empty net.Skorupski partially redeemed himself moments later as he clawed Yang Hyun-jun’s shot over the bar after Hatate’s pass threatened to get Maeda in behind.Hatate was booked for a foul on Lewis Ferguson before needlessly flicking out a boot to catch Miranda in the 34th minute as the pair chased a ball that was heading into the Bologna half.

The equaliser came in the 72nd minute as the former Norwich winger Rowe made space on the edge of the box and evaded the substitute Benjamin Nygren to smash a shot into the roof of the net.Celtic emerged from their shell and had opportunities to snatch an unlikely win. The substitute Johnny Kenny forced a save and might have been able to play Maeda in on a counterattack, though there were chances for the hosts too and Schmeichel saved from Riccardo Orsolini and Nicoloò Cambiaghi.“The sending off had a major effect on the game,” said O’Neill. “But the effort the team put in, the spirit they showed, the willingness to get blocks in, to defend the penalty box in the manner in which they did, I thought was really, really splendid.“My own view is that if we had stayed with 11 men, I think we would have won the game.”Mohamed Diomande’s first-half strike gaveRangerstheir first Europa League win of the season as they beatLudogorets1-0 at Ibrox.AlthoughRangerscannot reach the next stage of the competition Danny Röhl, with six wins in a row in all competitions, was looking for continued momentum as well as coefficient points.Striker Youssef Chermiti had a terrific chance in the ninth minute when a clever through ball from Thelo Aasgaard set him free but he shot straight at goalkeeper Hendrik Bonmann and the home side failed to capitalise on the loose ball.Ludogorets posed little threat but in the 29th minute a slick move cut open the Rangers defence and Jack Butland had to make a crucial save from Petar Stanic’s drive.However, after a short corner with Aasgaard and Jayden Meghoma on the left, a clutch of players fought for possession inside the visitors’ box and when Aasgaard slipped the ball to Diomande 12 yards from goal his low drive sped past the static Bonmann.Rangers midfielder Nico Raskin had two efforts at the start of the second half to no avail, and Chermiti had a right-footed drive parried to safety by the Ludogorets keeper, who then gathered a poor chip from Mikey Moore.At the other end, only a terrific block by home defender Emmanuel Fernandez prevented Deroy Duarte’s close-range shot getting through to test Butland, who moments later made a fine save from Caio Vidal’s angled drive.In the 70th minute Rangers substitute Bojan Miovski hesitated when set up by Diomande inside the box and was crowded out, before Bonmann saved a Djeidi Gassama shot and then a curler from distance by another home replacement, Findlay Curtis.Further pressure brought no more goals – and Butland had to make a save from Vidal on a Ludogorets break - but Rangers kept on the winning track.Lyonsecured their place in the next round with a hard-fought 1-0 win overYoung Boys, as Ainsley Maitland-Niles struck deep into first-half stoppage time in Bern.A late goal from Igor Matanovic gaveFreiburga 1-0 win at home againstMaccabi Tel-Aviv, ensuring the German side a place in the last 16.In Norway, a penalty in the 10th minute of stoppage time from Joachim Soltvedt rescued a 3-3 draw forBrannagainst the Danish sideMidtjylland.

The fact is Forest failed to perform and a stale display was typified by the chain of errors that culminated in the captain, Ryan Yates, scoring an own goal that proved sufficient to earn the hosts victory.A swell of the 2,100 away fans who made the trip to northern Portugal relayed their feelings to Sean Dyche and his squad, jeering the players on several occasions. At full time the question on supporters’ lips was a slightly more direct version of: what on earth was that?Europa League roundup: Jadon Sancho strikes to seal Aston Villa’s last-16 placeRead moreThings went from bad to worse on a disappointing evening when in stoppage time Elliot Anderson, part of a triple substitution midway through the second half, was given a straight red card for dissent. Forest fans were gravely unimpressed, though they had five shots on target and Braga none. The manner of the goal was painful if not comedic, Yates inadvertently diverting the ball past Matz Sels just 54 seconds after Morgan Gibbs-White saw his penalty saved by Lukas Hornicek.Dyche was disappointed with that “minute of madness” but the reality is their entire performance was below par. After the relative high of holding Premier League leadersArsenal to a drawat the City Ground last weekend, this marked a miserable low and it is now one win for Forest across their past eight matches in all competitions.Forest fans made their voices heard. “Yeah, of course, they’re frustrated,” Dyche said. “They want to do well in this competition. We want to do well in it. This is a great competition that the club has waited a long time to get into. Of course, I understand their frustration. There is a lot of expectation this season, I know because I lived in the area before I was manager, despite two managers and all the different players. They are still frustrated. It’s going to take time because we haven’t got magic dust.”View image in fullscreenOla Aina shows his disappointment after Braga take the lead against Nottingham Forest.Photograph: Luis Vieira/APKick-off at this striking stadium, carved out of a rock at the site of a former quarry with two lateral stands, felt a landmark achievement in itself given the biblical rainstorms in the hours before the game. But the pre-match excitement soon subsided. Forest made seven changes and the discernible weakness was in attack.Igor Jesus did not travel to Portugal after picking up a hip problem, leaving Forest without an orthodox striker after allowing Arnaud Kalimuendo to depart on loan for Eintracht Frankfurt, while Chris Wood is sidelined after knee surgery and Taiwo Awoniyi ineligible. So it was down to Dan Ndoye, a winger, to spearhead Forest’s attack and their lack of cutting edge was painfully apparent throughout. They are pushing through a move for the Napoli forward Lorenzo Lucca, who flew into England on Thursday to finalise a loan switch. Forest require a lift, and quickly.The visitors struggled to create chances but five minutes into the second half James McAtee, one of those given another chance, went down in the box under pressure from Gabri Martínez and the Croatian referee, Igor Pajac, awarded a penalty. There was a lengthy video assistant referee check and almost three minutes had passed by the time Gibbs-White stepped up to take the spot-kick. His right-foot penalty lacked conviction and Hornicek dived low to his left to push the ball away from his goal with his left hand.View image in fullscreenElliot Anderson (right) is sent off by Igor Pajac in stoppage time.Photograph: Zed Jameson/PAGibbs-White grimaced, Hornicek beamed. Braga flew forward on the counterattack and less than a minute later the ball was in the back of the Forest goal. Yates wore a look of disbelief after steering Ricardo Horta’s squared ball past Sels, the midfielder skidding into the netting as the ball bobbled into the net in slow motion.Just after the hour Ola Aina, who started at left-back with Nicolò Savona on the opposite flank, rattled the crossbar with a speculative, swerving effort from 30 yards but that in itself spoke volumes. Forest lacked invention and quickly tired of ideas. Worse still, they looked susceptible to conceding again. The Braga substitute Pau Víctor sent an effort against the inside of a post. Yates sent a header goalwards after Hornicek denied Ndoye from a tight angle, but it was all too little too late.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueSporting BragaNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There is an eagerness to refresh the midfield as part of a squad overhaul, the ambition being to recruit younger players for the long term.Casemiro earns about £430,000 a week and his departure will help free up funds for signings. Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton are on United’s midfield shortlist.Casemiro, who joined from Real Madrid in 2022 for £70m, wanted his exit announced this month to help him secure his next move. He plans to carry on playing after representing Brazil at the World Cup, and there is interest from clubs in Major League Soccer, Saudi Arabia and his homeland.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life,” Casemiro, who turns 34 next month, said. “From the first day that I walked out at this beautiful stadium, I felt the passion of Old Trafford and the love that I now share with our supporters for this special club. It is not time to say goodbye; there are many more memories to create during the next four months. We still have a lot to fight for together; my complete focus will, as always, remain on giving my everything to help our club to succeed.”Casemiro’s time in the Premier League coincided with a period of struggle at United but he will walk away with Carabao Cup and FA Cup winner’s medals. He got the first goal in the2023 Carabao Cup finaltriumph over Newcastle and has played 146 times for United, scoring 21 times.Chelseaare considering a move to sign another Brazil international midfielder, Douglas Luiz, on loan fromJuventusfor the rest of the season.

He has made only two league starts under Sean Dyche.Photograph: Kieran McManus/ShutterstockLiam Rosenior’s options include Moisés Caicedo, Enzo Fernández, Reece James, Dário Essugo, Roméo Lavia and Andrey Santos. But Essugo is yet to feature because of injury this season and Lavia has not played since November. Caicedo and Fernández have shouldered much of the burden and could benefit if Chelsea are able to bring in a player of Douglas Luiz’s experience and quality.The 27-year-old excelled for Aston Villa before joining Juve in 2024. He struggled in Italy and moved to Forest last summer. However he sustained a hamstring injury and has made only two league starts since Sean Dyche replaced Ange Postecoglou as manager. Forest have an obligation to buy if Douglas Luiz makes a certain number of appearances. They also have an option to buy.It remains to be seen whether Juve and Forest will be open to Chelsea taking on the loan. Chelsea are also in the market for a defender but are yet to reach an agreement with Rennes on a fee for Jérémy Jacquet.

The WSL club have been targeting experienced players this month, having often had the youngest average age in the division in their starting XI this season.Lehmann, who has played in England’s top flight for West Ham, Everton and Aston Villa, has 64 caps and was part of the Swiss squad at Euro 2025. She has signed a contract to 2028. “It feels like a homecoming, coming back to England, and I’m really happy,” she said.The 27-year-old joined Como from Juventus in August andtold the Guardianthe move “just felt right” but has not been a regular starter. She is Leicester’s fifth January signing, the fourth with WSL experience and the youngest of the arrivals, joining Rachel Williams, Ashleigh Neville, Sarah Mayling and Emma Jansson. Leicester have lost their experienced former captain Janice Cayman to PSV.Lehmann occupies a unique space in women’s football, having 15.9 million Instagram followers, 11.8 million TikTok followers and having recently finished a season co-managing a UK Baller League team with the TV host Maya Jama.The France striker Kelly Gago wants to leave Everton, their head coach, Brian Sørensen, has said but the club are yet to receive an offer they feel is suitable. Reports suggest the club want about £500,000.“She wants to go,” Sørensen said on Thursday, before Friday’s WSL meeting with Brighton. “She has a release clause in her contract so any club that wants her can just pay that and she is free to go. But from my understanding it’s like 10% of that release clause that’s been submitted [offered] so I don’t think she’s going anywhere.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueLeicester WomenTransfer windowWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

There are demons that just get brushed under the carpet without having the light shone on them.”It has taken the Swindon Town midfielder time and a change of club to process everything that happened in Scotland. Holden joined the Dons in August 2023, determined to establish herself as a key player at one of the biggest clubs in the Scottish Women’s Premier League. But just six matches and 31 minutes into the first season, she ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament away at Hibernian.The long way back to fitness was laid bare immediately, but Holden was unaware then that she would find navigating her relationship with the club her biggest test. Holden claims she was neglected by Aberdeen and members of its coaching and physiotherapy team, causing her mental health to deteriorate at an alarming rate and compel her, in 2025, to leave the life she had built in Scotland behind.Holden now feels obligated to speak out about her experience. In her latter months at the club, she spoke to the Professional Footballers’ Association, which offered her counselling sessions. Holden fears that other players are going through similar experiences in women’s football.“The rehab mentally destroyed me without me even realising it,” she says. “I was so naive to the fact that I was struggling, but when you think about it and you start to strip things back, I was depressed to the point where I did not even know it. That’s how scary it was. The elements throughout the rehab and the people I was dealing with was just not a good experience at all.”Aberdeen have been contacted by the Guardian and sent a list of questions regarding Holden’s recovery but did not want to comment.The club initially funded a scan but then wanted Holden to join the NHS waiting list. Holden, who felt this could delay her surgery for months and sideline her for much of her two-year deal, opted to pay for the operation herself. At the time, she did not want to jeopardise her chances of remaining at Aberdeen beyond her contract and decided against setting up a GoFundMe – a decision she now regrets.View image in fullscreenLaura Holden in hospital recovering from her ACL injury.Photograph: Laura Holden“I thought I was doing the right thing by not tarring the club with the fact that they wouldn’t support one of their women’s players,” she says. The operation cost around £8,000.Holden asked Aberdeen to stop paying her wages for playing football partly so that the club could pay for the surgery directly – an offer which she says was refused. “My salary across the 18 months that I was injured for would have just covered it, if not more,” she says. “The support from the club just wasn’t there, which I was really surprised by.”In addition Holden feels she was not supported appropriately by Aberdeen through her rehab, including by the club’s women’s team physio. Holden claims that when she had started to walk again, the physio handed her a rehabilitation programme to follow and “that was it”.Holden adds that she did not have any weekly check-ins or many targets to hit in her recovery. Instead, she says she was regularly told: “Your programme is in your book.” She says she constantly had to ask for advice, which made her feel like a burden. “It got to the point where I was apprehensive to approach this person, because I felt like I was the problem. I think that was the worst part.”Holden kept these feelings to herself. “I didn’t really open up to anyone on the team,” she says. “I was worried that if it got back to certain people it would impact even further what I was experiencing throughout my rehab.”Tensions reached a boiling point in the autumn of 2024 when Holden says she felt ready to return to training with the ball but claims she was repeatedly denied by the physio, who said she was not fit enough. Holden felt that these were excuses rather than an accurate assessment of where she was in terms of fitness.“Then there was one session,” Holden remembers, “she said that I couldn’t progress until I stopped limping, and I just blew up. We had a massive row about it outside on the pitch. All of the players heard it.” Holden says she got herself “into a bit of a state” where “I was crying so much I couldn’t even speak. Words weren’t even coming out of my mouth.”In October 2024 Aberdeen appointed a new coach in Scott Booth and, at the time, she was beginning to join in with training sessions. “I felt like a little kid at Christmas. I was able to kick a ball again, I was able to tackle people, it was everything that I wanted for so long.”A few sessions into her return to training, Holden says Booth told her that he wanted her to go on loan to another club. She was in disbelief. “I was thinking: ‘What world are we living in? I’ve literally just come back from an ACL injury. I haven’t even had a full month for proper training and you want me to go out on loan? I’m not even ready to play. I felt like he’d just written me off before even seeing me play.”After 543 days out injured, Holden eventually made her return to the pitch as a substitute against St Johnstone – a 30-second cameo at the end of a 4-1 victory. She would not play for Aberdeen again. Holden says she was left out of matchday squads by Booth on account of her fitness, despite the manager previously suggesting that she would go out on loan.Holden had wanted to stay at Aberdeen beyond the end of her contract in June 2025. She loved where she lived, her job in the club shop and playing football, “but the injury and coming back changed everything. When [Booth] came in, I was thinking I’m not wanted here, so what is the point even giving it the time of day?“I was so focused on getting physically fit, I didn’t take into consideration how I was actually feeling about it all. I didn’t let myself believe that I was struggling. I think that’s what the main issue was, but it got to the point where I was so done. I was so ready to just drop it all and quit.”Holden was encouraged to speak to Aberdeen’s HR department, who she met in April 2025. She says she told them she had felt neglected and that other players were treated better and asked them to investigate. “I felt like what loyalties do I have? I didn’t want it to continue,” she says. “I knew that someone was going to investigate it, but whether they did or not, I don’t know.”In June 2025, Holden joined Swindon. Even though she has left behind both good and bad memories of Aberdeen, moving on has been difficult. As of January 2026, Holden says she has not heard anything from the club regarding her complaint. “I don’t want what happened to me to happen to anyone else,” she says.Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free email about women’s football, Moving the Goalposts.

Spurs have lost players for the second-most days to injury at 625, slightly behind Newcastle’s 640.Frank is missing eight first-team players through injury, with Mohammed Kudus, Rodrigo Bentancur, Richarlison, Ben Davies and Bergvall picking up serious problems in their past five matches. James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski have not played all season but the club did confirm the £13m signing of Brazilian full-back Souza from Santos on Thursday.In better news for Frank, Dominic Solanke, Destiny Udogie and Xavi Simons emerged unscathed from the victory over Dortmund that eased some pressure on the head coach, and the midfielder João Palhinha should also be fit to face Burnley.“It seems like we are cursed or something like that,” Frank said, “but injuries are a part of football. We keep being very unlucky with injuries, and it looks like Lucas could be a longer one. He’s being assessed and we will know more in the next couple of days.”At this stage last season Spurs had sustained more injuries than any other Premier League club. After 22 games the tally was 25 injuries and they had lost 707 days to injury, but Frank said he had no issues with the medical department.“In my third year in the Premier League with Brentford we had a horrendous year and it impacted on the season,” he said. “We always look what we can do to avoid it. How can we make sure we do the maximum to get players back as quickly as possible? There are a lot of moving parts, the match schedule, the amount of games, but we’re not the only club struggling with injuries. Overall I’m very happy with medical and performance departments. We’ve made progress made this year.”Frank had arrived from his second lunch of the week with the Tottenham chief executive, Vinai Venkatesham, and director Nick Beucher, with the mood at the club’s training ground significantly more relaxed than after last weekend’s Premier League home defeat by West Ham.Perhaps emboldened by feeling more secure over his future Frank encouraged the club to offer a new deal to Micky van de Ven, who is under contract until 2029 but is attracting interest from Liverpool.“Micky is definitely a player we should prioritise, definitely a key player for this team and this club and hopefully for many years to come,” Frank said. “He has what it takes to be an even better player, and I’ve no doubt he can help to get us to where we want to be in the future.”Asked whether an offer of £100m would force Tottenham to consider selling, Frank said: “I would say he’s very important for us, so Micky is a Tottenham player now and for the future.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FranknewsShareReuse this content"

With Ben Duckett and Joe Root hitting watchful half-centuries, the base was set on a turner, chasing a target of 272.But the discontent continued as 129 for one turned into 165 for six, Sri Lanka’s spinners ripping everything apart under lights in the first of three ODIs. The left-armer Dunith Wellalage combined his 12-ball 25 with two wickets in the collapse as the hosts, chasing their ninth consecutive ODI series win at home, triumphed by 19 runs.Luke Wright to leave role as England cricket selector amid Ashes falloutRead moreThe numbers are grim for England’s 50-over side. This was their 11th consecutive away loss, Harry Brook’s reign blending into the final, miserable days of Jos Buttler’s time. The latter was at the other end as Rehan Ahmed played some of the shots of the night in a briefly promising seventh-wicket stand, and the rescue suddenly felt alive again with Jamie Overton’s late burst of 34. With 20 required from the final over, it was doable – but a clunk off Pramod Madushan’s full toss killed it.“The pitch got a little bit more extreme, it was proving very difficult to start as a batter out there,” said Brook of the defining middle passage. “Ducky and Rooty made it look fairly easy when they were set and going but they both came off and said it was hard to start on there; just getting used to the turn, bounce and sometimes the lack of spin when it just skids through.”The afternoon began with some promo for the upcoming T20 World Cup, co-hosted by Sri Lanka, with skydivers from the armed forces landing on the ground with the trophy. But the slow stuff was always going to be the real show under the stifling Colombo sun, so it was not a surprise that the new-ball passage was quiet for England. Overton, usually a middle-overs enforcer, opened up alongside Sam Curran as Sri Lanka’s openers batted through the powerplay.Curran realised that turning into a spinner was the way to go; his moon ball – a dipping, deceptive innovation – had Pathum Nissanka chipping to mid-on before Adil Rashid settled in. The leggie struck in his second over with a googly that went around the legs of Kamil Mishara, setting him up for very neat figures of three for 44. Liam Dawson, playing his first ODI since November 2022, was even tidier, conceding just two boundaries and dismissing Pavan Rathnayake.The sweep went wrong for three of Sri Lanka’s batters including the captain, Charith Asalanka, who was left confused by his swipe against Ahmed; while checking for traffic on both sides of the road, the ball lobbed up to slip, Brook moving to collect. But Kusal Mendis remained comfortable playing square, the late cuts getting him moving after two runs off his first 15 deliveries. An unbeaten 93 boosted his excellent recent record at home: an average of 67.25 in 20 games since the start of 2024.View image in fullscreenKusal Mendis on his way to an unbeaten 93 against England.Photograph: Eranga Jayawardena/APSri Lanka’s flourish at the back end of their innings coincided with a swelling of home support, cheers at their loudest, flags at the highest as Wellalage swung away to all sides and Overton went for 23 in the final over. On a ground that does not really do 300-something totals, Sri Lanka had control.Out came England’s Test openers for a hit in pyjamas, but the rhythm was the same as the Ashes: an early breakthrough for the opposition. Asitha Fernando’s setup was simple but effective, a nip-backer followed by a wide, away-swinging delivery. Zak Crawley, on six, threw his hands and edged behind.Duckett could not get his reverse sweep right, failing to make proper contact with a couple of Dhananjaya de Silva’s off-breaks. It spoke to his scratchiness. Root provided greater fluency but shared a similar gameplan, going hard with singles as England opted for some old-world graft. They both reached 50 in the same over. For Root, this felt standard; for Duckett it was a release, his first competitive half-century since the fifth Test against India last summer.Sri Lanka had curiously rested their primary threat with the ball, the wrist-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga. Maheesh Theekshana, third in the ICC rankings, was absent as well, but the others eventually clicked. Another attempted reverse sweep cost Duckett on 62, trapped leg-before by the leggie Jeffrey Vandersay. When Root departed lbw for 61 to De Silva, England were not yet halfway to the target, the required rate climbing.Cue serious trouble. Brook, on six, was undone by sizeable turn after coming down the pitch against Asalanka, stumped down the leg side. “It was like it hit a rock or something, it spun miles,” said the England captain. “It was a good bit of bowling, he’s obviously seen me come down, dragged his length back a bit and a good bit of keeping as well.” Ahmed – filling in for the unwell Will Jacks – lit up the skies with his 27. Overton demonstrated his power as well but the collapse was too severe.Explore more on these topicsCricketSri Lanka cricket teamEngland cricket teamnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s really never a good idea. For me, I’m always trying to stay in the present, living with what’s happening in the present.“Of course, after a tough year like last year, knowing it’s my last one here, my last Australian Open, my last year, it’s really special.“The emotions are really completely different. It’s a feeling that’s tough to describe. But it’s the reason why at 40 I’m still pushing myself, pushing the limit, practising hard in the off-season, it’s to live those moments.”Wawrinka will have a shot at a top player when he faces the ninth seed, Taylor Fritz, in round three. Fritz, who has been nursing a knee injury, progressed with a calm 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (4) win over Vit Kopriva.“I’m excited for it,” said Fritz. “I think it will be a fun match. I’ve looked up to Stan for a long time. I know he’s playing well. I practised with him in Perth at the United Cup. His average time on court per match this year has to be something insane because even at the United Cup he was battling long three-setters every match. It’s so impressive the level and just the physicality he’s still bringing.”There were no problems for Jannik Sinner, the second seed and defending champion, or the 10-times champion Novak Djokovic on Thursday. Sinner eased past the Australian James Duckworth, winning 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 and Djokovic dismissed the Italian qualifier Francesco Maestrelli 6-3, 6-2, 6-2.Meanwhile, Iga Swiatek continued to build momentum at the bottom of the women’s draw, defeating Marie Bouzkova 6-2, 6-3 to advance to round three, where she will face the 31st seed Anna Kalinskaya. Swiatek said her goal for the season is to be kinder to herself by resting more.“My goal for this year [is] to go somewhere and just rest and not do anything because I tend to do other stuff, like off-court obligations,” she said. “Obviously there is stuff that needs to be done. I also take quite a lot on my shoulders. My goal for this season is actually to unplug a bit better. Hopefully I’m going to have more energy till the end of the season.”Belinda Bencic, the 10th seed, fell 6-3, 0-6, 6-4 to the 19-year-old qualifier Nikola Bartunkova, the first significant upset in the women’s draw.Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Stan WawrinkaAustralian OpenAustralia sportTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The rest of the US team will be officially announced on Monday.Heated Rivalry star duo named torchbearers for 2026 Winter OlympicsRead moreThe roster includes 48 first-time Olympians, nearly half the delegation, alongside veterans such as Vonn,Mikaela Shiffrin, Chloe Kim and Jessie Diggins. The athletes range in age from 15-year-old freestyle skier Abby Winterberger to 44-year-old snowboardcross rider Nick Baumgartner, who is headed to his fifth Olympics.Vonn’s selection caps a sensational return to competition for the 41-year-old alpine skier, who retired in 2019 before returning to racing last season following a partial knee replacement. She hasreached the podium in all five World Cup downhill racesthis season – including two wins, a second place and two thirds – and will be a medal contender in Cortina d’Ampezzo, where the women’s alpine events will be held. Prior to Vonn’s remarkable comeback, the oldest woman to win a World Cup race was 34.Shiffrin, themost decorated alpine skier in history, will compete in her fourth Olympics. She enters the Gamesafter a disappointing Beijing Olympicsin 2022, where shefailed to win a medal, but has rebounded this seasonwith multiple World Cup victories, particularly in slalom.Kim, a two-time Olympic championin snowboard halfpipe, is aiming to win gold at a third consecutive Olympics. Her health remains a question aftershe injured her shoulder in trainingearlier this month, though US Ski & Snowboard officials said they expect her to be ready to compete in Livigno.The roster also confirms the absence of Jamie Anderson, a two-time Olympic gold medalistin snowboard slopestylewhose attempted comeback after having two children fell short. Anderson did not reach the podium during the Olympic qualification period and did not earn a spot on the team.“In many ways, making this team is even harder than the Olympics themselves,” US snowboard program director Rick Bower said in a statement. “The depth of our field is incredible and selection truly came down to the wire. These athletes pushed each other all season and every spot was earned.”US Ski & Snowboard accounted for more than 40% of the overall US Olympic delegation at the 2022 Beijing Games and won 15 of the country’s 25 medals. Officials said they expect a similarly large presence in Italy, where the Winter Games will be staged across four main clusters – Milan, Cortina d’Ampezzo, Valtellina and Val di Fiemme.“The athletes we are sending to the Games represent a large portion of Team USA and I am confident about the impact they will make in Italy,” US Ski & Snowboard president and chief executive Sophie Goldschmidt said.The alpine team comprises of 11 women and seven men. In addition to Vonn and Shiffrin, the women’s roster features Breezy Johnson, who returns to the Olympics after missing the 2022 Games with a knee injury, and Paula Moltzan, a former World Cup medalist. On the men’s side, Ryan Cochran-Siegle, asurprise silver medalist in the super-Gat the Beijing Games, returns alongside Bryce Bennett and River Radamus.Diggins will compete at her fourth Olympics in cross-country skiing and has saidthis will be her final Games before retiring. Diggins, a three-time Olympic medalist, leads a team that includes returning Olympians Rosie Brennan, Julia Kern and Gus Schumacher, as well as several first-time qualifiers.Freestyle skiing remains one of the strongest medal prospects for the US team. Jaelin Kauf, the Olympic silver medalist in moguls, returns alongside Chris Lillis, who won gold in mixed team aerials in Beijing. Olympic champion Alex Hall leads the freeski slopestyle squad, while Nick Goepper and Alex Ferreira return for their fourth and third Olympics, respectively.Snowboarding is again anchored by proven medalists. In addition to Kim, Red Gerard returns for his third Olympics afterwinning slopestyle gold as a teenagerin 2018. Baumgartner, the oldest athlete on the team, will again compete in snowboardcross after winning gold in the mixed team event in Beijing.“I love setting goals people think are unreachable and then going out there and proving them wrong,” Baumgartner told the Guardian at the Team USA media summit in October. “Father Time is the only undefeated opponent, but he hasn’t beaten me yet.”View image in fullscreenNick Baumgartner with and Lindsey Jacobellis at the 2022 Games.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockThe roster reflects the results-based selection process used by US Ski & Snowboard, with most spots determined over the past two seasons of World Cup and international competition. Officials said the team’s depth made final selections highly competitive across nearly every discipline.“We’ve seen quite remarkable results from our athletes across all 10 of our sports,” said Anouk Patty, US Ski & Snowboard’s chief of sport. “I know this is one of the strongest teams we have sent to the Games.”Competition venues will be spread across Italy, with men’s alpine events in Bormio, women’s alpine in Cortina, Nordic events in Val di Fiemme, and freestyle skiing and snowboarding in Livigno. A total of 116 medal events are scheduled.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026USA Olympic teamLindsey VonnJessie DigginsMikaela ShiffrinSkiingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

It suggests the impact of the technology may have been broader than previously thought. Public figures identified in sexualised images it analysed include Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Ice Spice, Nicki Minaj, Christina Hendricks, Millie Bobby Brown, the Swedish deputy prime minister Ebba Busch, and the former US vice-president Kamala Harris.The feature wasrestricted to paid userson 9 January and further restrictions followed after the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, called the situation “disgusting” and “shameful”. Other countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia, announced blocks on the AI tool.CCDH estimated that over the 11-day period, Grok was helping create sexualised images of children every 41 seconds. These included a selfie uploaded by a schoolgirl undressed by Grok, turning a “before school selfie” into an image of her in a bikini.“What we found was clear and disturbing: in that period Grok became an industrial-scale machine for the production of sexual abuse material,” said Imran Ahmed, CCDH’s chief executive. “Stripping a woman without their permission is sexual abuse. Throughout that period Elon was hyping the product even when it was clear to the world it was being used in this way. What Elon was ginning up was controversy, eyeballs, engagement and users. It was deeply disturbing.”He added: “This has become a standard playbook for Silicon Valley, and in particular for social media and AI platforms. The incentives are all misaligned. They profit from this outrage. It’s not about Musk personally. This is about a system [with] perverse incentives and no minimum safeguards prescribed in law. And until regulators and lawmakers do their jobs and create a minimum expectation of safety, this will continue to happen.”X announced it hadstopped its Grok featurefrom editing pictures of real people to show them in revealing clothes, including for premium subscribers, on 14 January.X referred to its statement from last week, whichsaid: “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.“We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including child sexual abuse material and non-consensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate ourXrules. We also report accounts seeking child sexual exploitation materials to law enforcement authorities as necessary.”Explore more on these topicsGrok AIXAI (artificial intelligence)Sexual harassmentElon MuskInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

The campaign includes a statement accusing tech firms of using American creators’ work to “build AI platforms without authorisation or regard for copyright law”.It adds: “Artists, writers, and creators of all kinds are banding together with a simple message: Stealing our work is not innovation. It’s not progress. It’s theft – plain and simple.”UK actors vote to refuse to be digitally scanned in pushback against AIRead moreThe statement urges AI companies to pursue licensing deals and partnerships with the creative industries and acknowledges firms that have taken that route. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, has signed deals with content owners including Disney and the Guardian, while Warner Music Group hasstruck a licensing dealwith AI music generator Suno.However, copyright remains one of the most contentious issues within AI, because the models that power chatbots like ChatGPT or image generators like Grok Imaginerely on vast amounts of data taken from the open webin order to help create their responses. Creative professionals argue that tech firms should seek their permission before using such material – and that they should receive a payment if they give their consent.OpenAI, and other AI firms, have argued that using material available online is “fair use”, a US legal doctrine that allows use of copyright-protected work without the owner’s permission in certain circumstances. As of last year,dozens of lawsuitshad been launched in the US over the AI and copyright issue.Johansson was dragged into the AI debate in 2024 after OpenAI’s voice assistantused her vocal likeness, prompting the actor say she was “shocked, angered and in disbelief” by the move. OpenAI subsequently removed the voice from ChatGPT.Other signatories to the statement include actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan and singer Cyndi Lauper. Last year Gilligan described AI as the “world’s most expensive and energy-intensive plagiarism machine”.The “Stealing Isn’t Innovation” push has been organised by the Human Artistry Campaign, whose backers include the Writers Guild of America, the Recording Industry Association of America and the actors’ trade union SAG-AFTRA, which went on strike in 2023,partly over the use of AI.In the UK, the government has been under fire for proposing that AI firms should be allowed to use copyright-protected work without first seeking artists’ permission, unless they signal that they wish to “opt out” of the process. The technology secretary, Liz Kendall, said this month that the government was seeking a “reset” on these plans via an official review due to be published in March.​Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Scarlett JohanssonCate BlanchettREMJodi PicoultOpenAInewsShareReuse this content"

This year is shaping up to be similarly geopolitically choppy, with Trump’s latest tariff threats against European allies over Greenland casting a shadow over shares this week.However, despite last year’s turmoil marketssoared to near-record highson the back of the AI boom, and investors are expected to keep betting big on the technology for now. Here are 10 of the companies most likely to take advantage of that enthusiasm with an IPO.OpenAIThe San Francisco-based company is synonymous with AI, having triggered a frenzy of public interest in the subject with the launch of the ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022. It is a loss-making business but has attracted investment from big names including Microsoft and theJapanese group SoftBank, and its valuation has boomed from $29bn in 2023 to $500bn last year. If OpenAI floats it could be valued at as much as $1tn, according to Reuters.Underpinning these numbers is a hope that demand for AI, and the transformative impact of its adoption by workplaces and individuals, more than pays back the multitrillion-dollar investment in the datacentres and computer chips that support it. OpenAI iscommitted to spending $1.4tnon such infrastructure over the next eight years, but must convince investors it can pay that back.“OpenAI is clearly the single biggest test for the entire AI economy, the bubble idea and whether it’s all built on sand,” said Neil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets.AnthropicLike OpenAI, the San Francisco-headquartered startup behind the chatbot Claude and the now wildly popular Claude Code is also yet to turn a profit. This month, the company signed a term sheet fora $10bn funding roundthat puts its valuation at $350bn.If Anthropic floats, it may have ramifications that go beyond the AI race. Many of its employees arealignedwith the effective altruism movement, and energeticdiscussionon internet forums suggests that money could pour into causes aligned with this movement if its employees cash out.View image in fullscreenThe reputation of the owner of SpaceX, Elon Musk, could complicate a potential listing.Photograph: John Raoux/APSpaceXElon Musk’s companyreportedly reached a $800bn valuationin December and is preparing to go public. However, “whether it actually happens, when it happens, and at what valuation are still highly uncertain”, according to comments from its chief financial officer, Bret Johnsen, in a letter obtained by Reuters.On the one hand, geopolitical volatility is likely to make the nexus between tech, aerospace and defence more appealing to investors, said Mike Bellin at PricewaterhouseCoopers. This may have ramifications for SpaceX. On the other, Elon Musk’s reputation, and that of Tesla, make the outcome of the IPO somewhat harder to predict, said Mark Moccia, an analyst at research firm Forrester, although he expects “a huge mix of institutional and retail investors”.“SpaceX in particular is what retail investors are homing in on this year as it’s got the buzz and it’s Musk,” said Neil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets.KrakenOne of the world’s largest crypto exchanges – not to be confused with thesoftware spin-off of the UK energy firm Octopus– Krakensubmitted its paperwork for an IPOin November, and was valued roughly at $20bn. The crypto firm could face a race to float its stock before this year’s US midterm elections,say analysts, as there is a risk political changes in the US reverse Trump’s laissez-faire approach to crypto regulation.DatabricksThis company helps customers to build AI agents – tools that carry out tasks autonomously – using their own data. Its revenue grew more than 55% last year and last month itachieved a valuation of $134bn.Ali Ghodsi, Databricks’ chief executive, says the company’s growth rate is due to businesses building “data-intensive applications that use AI”.CanvaA bright light of Australia’s tech industry, Canva was valued last year at $A65bn, although it has moved its parent company domicile to the US in order to prepare for a flotation. The Sydney-based software design company, which calls its employees “Canvanauts”, has 240 million users and two of its co-founders – the wife and husband team Melanie Perkins and Cliff Obrecht – are sixth on the Australian rich list, according to the Financial Review, with a combined fortune of $14bn.A Canva spokesperson said it had “nothing to share in terms of an IPO timeline”.AndurilPalmer Luckey, the chief executive of the defence-tech startup, has said Anduril is “definitely going to be a publicly traded company”, but has not given a timeline. Analysts cite the company’s close ties with the Trump administration and Trump’sdecision to hike military spendingas factors that may push it towards an offering this year.“Trump’s 50% increase in defence spending announcement should be the green light to go for it,” said Wilson.An Anduril spokesperson said “we don’t have a timeline for IPO” and called rumours about a 2026 flotation “pure speculation”.View image in fullscreenThe digital bank Monzo had more than 12 million customers last year.Photograph: Monzo/PAMonzoMonzo is an online bank that operates entirely through a mobile app. Itreportedmore than 12 million customers in 2025.The London-based fintech – the jargon for tech firms that offer financial services like banking or payments – wasreportedly working with Morgan Stanleylast summer to meet investors before a 2026 IPO – but this was later complicated by the exit of its chief executive, TS Anil.BoltThe Estonian rival to Uber, Boltlined upan adviser for an IPO last year. The company has had a difficult few years, however, withreported losses of more than €102min 2024. The company is reportedly considering whether to list in the EU or the US.A Bolt spokesperson said: “Any date for listing will depend on favourable market conditions, which remains a significant factor in determining when Bolt goes public. Our teams are working to ensure the business is ready to IPO, should market conditions be right.”StripeThe online payment processing company was founded by the Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison in 2010. It has headquarters in California and Dublin and has long been a cornerstone of fintech. Last year it was reported that Stripe had attained a valuation of $107bn, a bounceback from when it was valued at $50bn in 2023. A Stripe spokesperson declined to comment.Anthropic, Kraken, Monzo, SpaceX and Databricks did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsTechnology sectorStock marketsTechnology startupsCryptocurrenciesOpenAISpaceXMonzo bankfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Specifically, he is concerned about their effects on an already expensive electricity market in the United States. Will Americans’ resentment of sharply rising energy costs scuttle his party’s November election ambitions?The US president’s anxiety is evident in two actions in recent weeks. On 13 January, Trump and Microsoft’s president jointly announced that the tech giant would pay more for its datacenters, paying full property taxes and accepting neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts in towns where it operates datacenters.“We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft.”Trump says Microsoft will pay more for its datacenters’ electricityRead moreOn 16 January, Trump and governors of states in the north-east US directed the country’s largest power grid operator to hold an emergency reliability power auction by September, perBloomberg. The move could force tech giants to pay for the construction of new power plants by requiring them to bid on the future reliability of the electricity they plan to draw from the grid.“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump said.OpenAI followed Microsoft’s lead with an announcement on 20 January. The company committed to “paying our own way on energy, so that our operations don’t increase your electricity prices”. The company is part of the Stargate collaboration between the AI industry and theTrump administrationto invest $500bn in AI infrastructure.Trump is tugging at the edges of the problem of rapidly rising electricity demand. He promised Americans he’d slash their electricity bills by half. But as the Guardianreportedjust after Trump and Microsoft made their joint proclamation, there’s little prospect of him delivering on that vow. At the same time that AI is increasing the demand for electricity, the administration is blocking renewable energy projects Trump calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of US homes, instead pushing the expansion of drilling for gas and oil. Administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas could counterintuitivelyraisecostsfurther for domestic consumers.Power prices play into larger concerns about the cost of living in the US, an issue that has Trump’s party on its back foot as congressional elections loom in November.As ever with technology news,Elon Muskis part of the story. On 15 January, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled that Musk’s company xAI hadillegally been operating methane-powered generatorsat its Memphis facility. The ruling establishes a precedent for tech companies in search of more electricity than they can obtain from the grid: you can’t simply bring in a backup generator, like a homeowner would do when facing a regular power outage. You’ll have to purchase nuclear power plants likeMeta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon have. Musk and xAI have not commented.European governments are likewise confronting the limitations their resources pose on the potential growth of datacenters, which are limitlessly hungry. In Germany, which boasts the highest number of datacenters in Europe, high energy prices constrain growth. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, like Trump, is very much in favor of constructing more datacenters but has taken an opposite tack to the US president’s deal with Microsoft. InNovember, Merz’s ruling party agreed to subsidize heavy industrial use of electricity until 2028 and reduce grid fees for consumers and businesses alike. One important distinction from the US: datacenters in Germany are required to source half of their electricity from renewable sources. Germans are skeptical of the tech industry’s ability to abide by the requirement, which leads to general wariness of expanding datacenter construction, according to asurvey published in October.In the UK, home to the second-highest number of datacenters in Europe, construction of new facilities is expanding, and energy costs are rising. Electricity rates in the UK are already multiple times those in the US and among the highest in the world, and increases pose severe problems for a populace that has dealt with a cost-of-living crisis for multiple years now. Despite the brewing problem, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technologyproposedin November to offer electricity discounts to datacenters in so-called “AI growth zones” to encourage investment and development.Big tech continues to bend the knee to Trump a year after his inaugurationRead moreA nearby example looms large: in neighboring Ireland, datacenters’ electricity useovertook that of all urban homes in 2024. The strain on the grid has led to significantly higher costs for everyday Irish people, so much so that the Irish government imposed a ban on new datacenters connecting to Dublin’s power grid in 2021. The measure effectively prohibited new construction in the city and its surrounding area. It ended in December.The next stops in the datacenter boom are locales with resource limitations of different sorts. Trump and the tech giants have committed to constructing one of the largest datacenters in the world in the United Arab Emirates and several more facilities elsewhere in the Gulf states. Energy is cheap in the region, but the billions of liters of water that datacenters need to cool off isscarce. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta have likewise announced$17bn in investment in data centers in India, where electricity availability is far less reliable than in the US or Europe. Part of the promised cash may be needed to fund the modernization of the grid, or, as has been the case in the city of Mumbai, local governments maykeep ageing infrastructure in use longer than intended, worsening pollution.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyDonald TrumpAI (artificial intelligence)Trump administrationOpenAIMicrosoftUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Could this lead to alarming outcomes?Emine SanerThu 22 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTShareAt Stoke primary school in Coventry, there are many four-year-olds among those starting in reception class who can’t sit still, hold a pencil or speak more than a four-word sentence. Lucy Fox, the assistant headteacher and head of foundations, is in no doubt what is causing this: their early exposure to screens, and a lot of it. When the children experiment with materials and creativity, and make things in the classroom, she says, “We notice a lot of children will cut pieces of cardboard out and make a mobile phone or tablet, or an Xbox controller. That’s what they know.”At another school in Hampshire, a longtime reception teacher says in the last few years she has noticed children getting frustrated if activities aren’t instant and seamless – something she thinks comes from playing games on a phone or tablet. There is a lack of creativity and problem-solving skills, noticeable when the children are playing with Lego or doing jigsaw puzzles and turning the pieces to fit. “I find their hand-eye coordination isn’t very good, and they find puzzles difficult. Doing a puzzle on an iPad, you just need to hold and move it on the screen. They get really frustrated and I feel like there are certain connections the brain is not making any more.”There is also something of an attitude shift, she says – a kind of individualism that she’s convinced comes from playing alone on a device. “We are having to model to children how to be with others, how you work as a team, how you share things, because they’re so used to having their own time, doing their own thing. We’re losing a big part of being human, and if these young children don’t get all those skills, they’re not going to pick them up later on.”View image in fullscreenCreative play is crucial for brain development.Photograph: Posed by models; PeopleImages/Getty Images/iStockphotoEarlier this month, the government announced it would beissuing new guidanceon screen use for under-fives in April, after a report it commissioned found 98% of two-year-olds were watching screens on a typical day, with the average duration more than two hours. Those who spent the most time – around five hours – had limited vocabulary compared with those who spent the least, and were twice as likely to show signs of emotional and behavioural difficulties.“It’s a trend that we’ve been seeing for quite a long time,” says Pasco Fearon, a professor of developmental psychopathology at University College London and the director of theChildren of the 2020sstudy. “Look at studies getting all the way back to the turn of the century – you can see that screen time, on the whole, has been increasing.” That’s true for all of us, not just for children. Of the impact on children, Fearon says: “I’m sure it’s a factor that a lot of parents, like the rest of us, are on their phones. It’s becoming very dominant in everyone’s lives.” The data in this study, he says, “can be quite a useful focal point to start thinking: Wait, is this what we want? A little bit of a reset might be useful for everyone.”This report comes on the back of other recent research showing very young children’s screen access is increasing. In October, the Americanresearch organisation Pewfound that 38% of parents of under-twos said their child uses or interacts with a smartphone, and 8% of under-fives had their own smartphone. In the UK, Ofcom’s research has found that19% of children aged three to fivehad their own mobile phone in 2024, and that37% of children this age– more than 800,000 kids – were using at least one social media app, up from 29% in 2023 (though the majority use it with their parents’ supervision).Young people, parents and teachers in the UK: share your views on the proposed social media ban for under-16sRead moreThe Conservatives have justpledged to follow Australiaand ban social media for under-16s, and the Labour government has said it will consider doing the same. (Australia’s ban, incidentally, includes YouTube but not YouTube Kids, which is aimed at younger viewers – so it does not necessarily address the problem of excess screen time.)Unlike for teenagers, little research has been done on the impact of social media on the youngest children. At the extreme end, all children are at risk of sexual abuse online. In November last year, the NSPCC reportedonline grooming crimes had reached record highs, with the youngest victim being just four.More is becoming known about the impact of young children exposed to excessive screen time, though. In 2025,a New Zealand studyfound that young children who had watched more than 90 minutes a day had below-average vocabulary, communication and numeracy at the ages of four and eight, and that more screen time meant even poorer outcomes.TodayKindred Squared, an organisation that campaigns for early years education and development, releases its latest report on children’s school readiness. It found that more than half of teachers believed spending too much time on screens – by children and their parents alike – was the single biggest factor contributingto the child not being ready to start school. “We know that screen time is a problem,” says the CEO, Felicity Gillespie. This year, reception teachers reported 28% of children were unable to use a book correctly, for instance tapping or swiping the pages as if it were an electronic device.“In cases of higher usage,” says Gillespie, “there is a real negative impact on language acquisition. It’s not that surprising when you think about how language is developed in babies, that it is through that serve-and-return interaction with adults – the baby makes a noise, the parent makes a noise back. The baby smiles, the parent smiles. It’s that two-way interaction that fires the baby’s brain. Nought to two is the period when our brains are growing at their fastest rate, so the earlier you put babies in front of screens, the more they are missing out [on] those early interactions, which is where the hard-wiring of the brain is happening.”The early years, says Gillespie, “are the foundation for everything that follows, for mental and physical health, wellbeing, your happiness, your success in relationships. I think it comes back to this need for better information for parents and clear, simple, unequivocal guidance. Tell them the truth. Tell them what the evidence says.”The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends children under two should get no screen time at all, and for those aged two to four, a maximum of one hour. Is that realistic in today’s parenting world? Gillespie acknowledges the latest study showing two-year-olds are watching two hours a day. “Then what we then need to do is give parents the information about why the WHO advises that, to inform people about the preciousness of these early years and the importance of brain development.” The government, she hopes, will “give parents the kind of practical, real-world guidance that takes account of the fact that, I think, we’ve probably missed the boat on the WHO guidance”.View image in fullscreenCovid forced many parents to rely on screen-based entertainment.Photograph: Posed by models; Giselleflissak/Getty ImagesThe Covid pandemic accelerated screen use (many children in current reception classes and year 1 were born in that first year), but it had been steadily rising before that. “My referrals have been increasing over the past 10 years,” says Sandy Chappell, an early years speech and language therapist. During the lockdowns, she says, it was “not just that children were isolated from other children, but also that parents were relying more on screens to pacify young children. I had many parents in impossible situations, where they were trying to work from home and had babies and toddlers to entertain at the same time, so they had no choice but to rely on screens.”She has sympathy for parents who rely on screens now. “Absolutely. It’s unbelievably difficult.” Fearon too, talking about the research that is driving the government’s advice, stresses it’s not about blaming parents. The study found children from disadvantaged families were more likely to spend time on screens. “This is about understanding the context in which this is happening, and how people are making the day work when there are challenges families are experiencing, financially, and in terms of work and all the pressures of daily life. If we’re trying to support families, it’s partly about giving them really clear advice, but also about giving more help to families, particularly those who are experiencing economic disadvantage. That’s going to give them a bit more slack to be able to play more, talk to their children more, be more engaged in the way that they’d like to.”In Chappell’s clinic, she is seeing children with “poor attention and listening skills, poor turn-taking and social skills, as well as poor vocabulary and expressive language”. Many have their own electronic devices, and although Chappell has seen the stats about social media use, it’s not something she’s aware of. “Parents don’t tend to tell me that’s what’s happening, because I think instinctively they know it’s not a good thing.” And while some content is better than others – “things like [the BBC’s] CBeebies, where [many programmes are developed with] educational value by psychologists and educationists” – what matters more is duration. “We really need to cut the time down,” says Chappell.She can spot the children who have spent a lot of time on screens: she has seen preschoolers, she says, who will spend seven or eight hours a day on a screen. Other children might be shy to begin with, but will soon start talking to her or will go straight to investigate her toy collection. Those who have spent a lot of time on screens, she says, don’t tend to interact with her and “don’t seem to be particularly interested in toys. They can’t follow simple instructions. They’re wandering around the room – and I’m not talking about young toddlers here, but three- and four-year-olds. They start school without even the basic skills that they need in order to be able to learn.”This is often when the child is referred to her, with parents worrying they’re not ready for school. “Preschool children can catch up to a certain extent if the screens are reduced to a bare minimum and time is spent on building other skills. It becomes more difficult once they get to school, and we are finding that these issues are following children right through school. Their language levels at age four are one of the biggest predictors of their later academic achievement at GCSE level and beyond. So it really is important that we put the work in with children way before they go to school.”View image in fullscreen‘Children are used to doing their own thing.’Photograph: Posed by model; Caia Image/Getty ImagesBy the time they join reception, many children will already be familiar with a tablet, and in 2025, for the first time, children used a touchscreen device to take the 20-minute test known as thereception baseline assessment. “There were children who couldn’t speak a sentence who did very well in the assessment, because they could scroll,” says Fox, sounding exasperated. “It became not an assessment of what children academically could do, and where they were developmentally, but an assessment of how computer-literate they were – and that’s what horrified me.”To accommodate 60 reception children, but without space within the school, Stoke Primary turned a wooden “roundhouse” (a simple octagonal wooden structure), which had been in their forest school area, into a new classroom, complete with rugs, fairy lights and, inadvertently, no wifi – and therefore no screens. At first, as Fox wrote in TES (formerly the Times Educational Supplement), this seemed an “inconvenience” and a “hurdle”. It ended up transforming her thinking on screens in schools; her previous job had been in a school which prided itself on giving each child an iPad.My analogue month: would ditching my smartphone make me healthier, happier – or more stressed?Read more“Very quickly we realised the impact that it was having on the children,” says Fox now. By the end of that first autumn term, 72% of the “roundhouse” children were considered to be “on track” compared with 44% of the children in the traditional classroom. When they switched the classes later in the year, they got similar results.The roundhouse style, in which children sit in a circle, “forces communication and language to come before anything, which is so important. We have quite a significant amount of English as an additional language compared with other schools – 60% of our children in reception last year – so the language skills that it’s pulling out of them is remarkable.” Instead of the usual schemes, or structured lesson plans that use PowerPoint and other software, “there is none of that in the roundhouse. It forces you to go back to basics. I had to build up the confidence of those teachers to feel they could do that, and could make their own decisions about what they knew was best for their children. We all know that we live in a digital age, and there is no stopping digital growth. But to what extent are we using tech to replace the things that we know are best for our children?” Both reception classes no longer use screens for teaching, though the older classes do.Fox is turning her attention to the newest generation of teachers coming through. “They’re from a different generation,” she says – people who have grown up with screens themselves. “How can we give them the confidence to know what’s best, and to put the scheme down and just connect with their children?”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Studios in Halifax, Canada and Stockholm are being closed, with restructuring to follow in other countries, it said.What’s behind the phenomenon of ‘gamer brain’Read moreAfter the announcement, Ubisoft’s shares fell by a third to their lowest level since 2011 on Thursday, valuing the company at €590m (£514m) compared with a peak of more than €10bn in the previous decade. The Paris-based company said it planned to split its operations into five creative divisions organised by genre, part of a broader attempt to sharpen focus and rein in costs after years of disappointing releases and weak results.The company said the restructuring was driven by the competitive market for AAA games, the term for big-budget, high-profile titles such as Grand Theft Auto.“The triple-A industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands,” said Ubisoft’s founder and chief executive, Yves Guillemot.However, Guillemot added that successful triple-A games have “more financial potential than ever”.Ubisoft also blamed an “increasingly competitive market” for shooters, a key genre for the industry.Laurent Michaud, a gaming industry economist, said action adventure titles such as Prince of Persia were out of step with a market dominated currently by shooters like Fortnite and Call of Duty, cooperative adventure titles such as Peak and sports titles and multiplayer games such as those available on the Roblox platform.‘I wanted that Raiders of the Lost Ark excitement – you could die any minute’: how we made hit video game Prince of PersiaRead more“The expectations of gamers are quite different to where they were 10 years ago. That’s why it’s difficult to keep in touch with an audience that has changed so much over the years.”He added: “Ubisoft is still one of the most popular content providers in the video games industry. It has developed one of the best IP slates in the industry but even if the games are really good, it is not enough. It has to meet people’s expectations and tastes.”The latest overhaul follows several difficult years marked by game delays, cancellations and weak execution, which have eroded investor confidence and strained the group’s finances. In November 2025, Ubisoft postponed the publication of its half-year results at the last minute, triggering a week-long suspension of trading in its shares and bonds. The company later said an accounting change had revealed a breach of the terms for its debt.Explore more on these topicsGamesUbisoftAssassin's CreedTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

Standing on the trapdoor causes it to yawn open like iron jaws, dropping you through a vertical shaft into a subterranean museum. Here, dozens of doors line the walls of three vaulted grey galleries, each leading to a pocket dimension of dizzying virtual architecture and fierce gladiatorial combat.Welcome to Quake Brutalist Jam, the hottest community event for lovers of id Software’s classic first-person shooter from 1996. First run in 2022, the Jam started out as a celebration of old-school 3D level design, where veteran game developers, aspiring level designers and enthusiast modders gather to construct new maps and missions themed around the austere minimalism of brutalist architecture.This third iteration of the Jam goes much further. In an intense six-week session, contributors designed 77 brutalist-themed maps where players fight new enemies with new weapons. For context, the original Quake, built by legendary game designers such as John Carmack, John Romero, Tim Willits and American McGee, featured 37 levels when it was first released.View image in fullscreen‘Brutalism won by a wide margin’ … Quake Brutalist Game Jam.Photograph: id SoftwareBen Hale is the event’s concierge, a professional game developer working as seniorenvironment artist on the forthcoming survival game Subnautica 2. As a child, Hale learned to build Quake levels with the encouragement of his older brother. “He was very supportive, despite how often I bluescreened his computer,” Hale recalls.The idea for a brutalism-themed “jam” – a hobbyist term for an intensive, community game development session that takes place over several days or weeks – came from another Quake mapper named Benoit Stordeur, inspired by a set of concrete textures Hale designed for Quake. “I posted a poll [of themes] for the community to vote on, with brutalism as a choice. Brutalism won by a wide margin,” Hale says.The firstQuake Brutalist Jamcaptured the community’s imagination, with participants producing 35 levels in two-and-a-half weeks using Hale’s concrete textures. In a game that already features oppressive gothic and industrial environments, the moody stylings of brutalism proved powerful creative fuel. “So many brutalist buildings look like cool sci-fi structures or evil lairs,” Hale says. Thesecond jamran in 2023, spawning 30 more proudly grey levels for players to blast through.But as he began planning a third jam, Hale ran into some health issues. “I pitched to my friend, Fairweather, to be my cohost this year,” Hale says. “They made the suggestion that we do something a little different this time.”View image in fullscreen‘Ideas began to grow’ … Quake Brutalist Game Jam.Photograph: id SoftwareFairweather is Lain Fleming, a veteran modder who has led numerous community Quake projects includingDwell,Remix Jamand theCoffee Quakeseries. Rather than simply make new levels for Quake, Fleming suggested giving the Jam’s participants some new tools to work with. “When we began, we simply wanted to visually overhaul some weapons and monsters. But as we did more and more, ideas began to grow,” Fleming says. “We analysed mechanical gaps in the arsenal and enemies, which resulted in many new enemy paradigms you rarely see in Quake.”This type of mod, known as a total conversion, proved far more ambitious than Hale or Fleming anticipated. “What was supposed to be a quick six-month mod to host a jam in became a two-year monstrosity. The list of people contributing grew bigger over time, with a team of about 15 near the end,” Hale says.Despite the challenges, the team ultimately produced an almost entirely new toolset for Quake. Virtually every available weapon is new or heavily modified, including a shotgun with bouncing projectiles, a gun that launches iron rebars, and a cluster-missile launcher. Enemies, meanwhile, mix redesigned Quake staples with entirely new foes.The overhaul proved hugely successful. Quake Brutalist Jam 3 had more than double the number of participants for previous jams – so many that Hale had to radically alter his plans for the Start map, the playable mission-select screen that’s something of a Quake tradition. “I opted for a museum or gallery approach,” Hale says. “We had to pack the maps very tightly, which I struggled with a lot.”The range of levels contributed by the community is enormous. There are quickfire experiments that last a matter of minutes, high-intensity “slaughtermaps” designed to test player reflexes, ambitious, narrative-driven exploration levels that pay tribute to the form and shape of virtual architecture, and gargantuan gun-fests that last an hour or longer.View image in fullscreen‘Doubts would lead to slower progress’ … Mazu’s Quake Brutalist level.Photograph: id SoftwareIndeed, the featured map, Escape from KOE-37, is almost a game in its own right – an epic three-hour affair heavily inspired by Half-Life with its own storyline and more than 1,000 enemies to fight. Its creator, who goes by the online handle Mazu, is a veteran of the Quake mapping community who spent about 400 hours building it. “Environmental puzzles and set-pieces are just really fun to do. [I] really wanted to have interactive environments for players to explore,” he says. “I just allow my creativity to put ideas into my map without axing too many of them. Doubts would lead to slower progress.”Maps such as KOE-37 highlight the remarkable work that community members have been doing for years in a space that professional game design has long since abdicated. Once the most popular genre around, linear, single-player first-person shooters have become relatively rare in mainstream game development, pushed to one side in favour of sprawling open worlds and multiplayer experiences. As such, the particular level design that games like Doom and Quake specialise in – complex 3D mazes where navigation is as much a part of the challenge as combat – is at risk of becoming a lost art.Yet events such as QBJ3, alongside other Quake mods such asArcane DimensionsandThe Immortal Lockare not only keeping this style of virtual architecture alive, they often surpass the achievements of the old masters, twisting and warping and spooling out 3D geometry in ways that wouldn’t have been possible 30 years ago: “With these games, you have such a rich, decades-long history of levels to play that you can refine your own designs to a razor’s edge,” Fleming says.View image in fullscreen‘Everyone shows off’ … from Robert Yang’s contribution.Photograph: id SoftwareQuake Brutalist Jam 3 isn’t just for hardcore Quake fans and shooter addicts. This year’s Start map has a section dedicated to newcomers with little to no mapping experience. At the other end of the spectrum, it has also seen contributions from industry professionals such as game designer and former teacher at New York University’s Game Centre, Robert Yang.“It’s the underground Met Gala of concrete murderzone design, the biggest event on the Quake calendar,” Yang says. “Everyone shows off, everyone nurtures the new faces, everybody eats. I love it.”For his contribution, One Need Not Be a House, Yang created an open-ended map that, were it not for all the heavily armed soldiers milling about, wouldn’t look out of place in an adventure game like Myst. “My map started as a study of the architectLouis Kahn’s ‘brick brutalism masterpieces – theNational Assemblycomplex in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and theIndian Institute of Managementin Ahmedabad [in India],” he says.Open-ended levels can be tricky, and highly unusual for a Quake map. To help solve this problem, Yang looked to one of the most famous levels from Halo: Combat Evolved –The Silent Cartographer. “I wanted to make a similar non-linear map but with many branching paths, so you can mix and match your own route, get powerups out of order, and feel like you’re getting away with something.”Yang says he doesn’t particularly like playing Quake as a shooter, but he admires how Quake Brutalist Jam 3 hints at a potential alternative way of making games, one that is driven by community rather than profit. “Brutalism, especially in the UK, is about building for the public. You don’t need to add beautiful ornaments because building and nurturing the future is already beautiful,” he says. “And that’s what Quake Brutalism is about too, a socialist utopia where handcrafted video games are a free public good that brings people together.”It may not be long before Hale, along with Fleming and the other organisers, put such an idea into practice. Their next planned project is their own video game, one that’s fully independent of id Software’s shooter. “After this jam, we’re taking a bit of a break from modding and mapping for Quake,” Hale concludes. “We love the community and the continuous celebration of each other’s work and aren’t going anywhere. But also, we want to just make a game. We’ve been wanting to do that for so long it’s starting to hurt.”Explore more on these topicsGamesArchitecturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is the globe and laurels of the UN – only gold, because this is Donald Trump’s initiative, and showing little of the world beyond North America.The charter of the board,formally launchedin Davos on Thursday, suggests that this is less America First than Trump Always. It is not “the US president” but Mr Trump himself who is named as chair, for as long as he wishes. He can pick his successor, decide the agenda and axe whomever he chooses – even if they have coughed up the $1bn demanded for permanent membership. It is the institutional expression of his belief that he is bound not by law but “my own morality, my own mind”.The body was birthed in subterfuge: the UN security councilauthorised a board of peacechaired by Mr Trump to oversee administration and reconstruction in Gaza. Despite misgivings about the colonialist model and free rein given to the US president, thevagueness of the resolutionand desire to ensure his buy-in to a ceasefire won its passage.What the US has created is something entirely different. The board’s charter does not mention Gaza once. A man increasingly fixated on landgrabs now heads an “international peace-building body” to replace “failed” institutions. To what extent this is a serious attempt toencroach upon, if not supplant, the UN, versus a symbolic declaration of power and creation of another forum for polishing his ego,is unclear. Mr Trump appears to have overplayed his hand again. His claim that Vladimir Putin had joined (Mr Putin disagreed) made it easier for the UK and others to back away from an offer they were not supposed to refuse.Benjamin Netanyahu, another leader indicted by the international criminal court, will sit alongside the likes of Belarus, Uzbekistan and Hungary. Eight Muslim-majority states, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey, havetogether agreedto join. But traditional US allies are conspicuously absent. It is unclear how others can make themselves heard on Gaza’s future if they rightly shun a deliberate attempt to undermine multilateral institutions. But they must. The already difficult, almost impossible task of winning peace in Gaza and justice for Palestinians has been further compromised. With an executive board – featuring Tony Blair and Mr Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner – and a Gaza executive board containing regional officials, Palestinians are relegated to a fourth-tier technocratic committee.For 2 million Palestinians enduring a brutal winter amid the ruins and ongoing bombardment by the Israeli military, Thursday’s presentation of plans for the next 100 days by Palestinian and US officials at least suggests that the administration has not totally lost interest. Mr Kushner’s ambitious proposals will displease those on the Israeli right who want to displace Palestinians entirely. Increases in aid, the reopening of the Rafah crossing, repairs to essential infrastructure and the reconstruction of homes and hospitals are all desperately needed. But what will materialise and on what terms?Mr Trump’s real-estate fixation and desire to be applauded as a peacemaker may be the best hope of keeping him engaged, and reducing Mr Netanyahu’s sway. But the rights of Palestinians are being treated as an irrelevant detail. That cannot stand. Mr Trump has contempt for international law; others must continue to defend it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For nowMohamad BazziAfter a bombastic speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump backed away from his threat to impose tariffs on European countriesThu 22 Jan 2026 13.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 18.58 ESTShareIn the past few days, Donald Trump turned the US presidency into a tool for his personal glory and vengeance. On Saturday, he threatened to impose tariffs of up to 25% on a bloc of European countries until Denmark agrees to sell Greenland to the US. The next day,Trump textedNorway’s prime minister, saying his failure to win the Nobel peace prize was one of the reasons he’s intent on seizing control of Greenland. After being snubbed for last year’s award, Trump said he no longer felt the need “to think purely of peace”.By Tuesday morning, as European leaders continued to absorb the shock of Trump’s threats and insults, the president posted anAI-generated memethat showed him planting a US flag on the island, flanked by his vice-president and secretary of state. “Greenland. US Territory. Est. 2026,” the image said. (Trump sharedanother image, also apparently edited by AI, that showed him sitting alongside a map of the US that includes Canada, Greenland and Venezuela, as he spoke with European leaders assembled at the White House.) Later on Tuesday, when he was asked at a press conference how far he was willing to go to acquire Greenland, Trump responded tersely: “You’ll find out.”On Wednesday, after a bombastic speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump backed away from his threat to impose tariffs on European countries and said he had reached “the framework of a future deal” on Greenland with the Nato secretary general. In other words, Trump began to defuse a global crisis of his own making.Over the past year, the world watched Trump’s second term devolve into abrazen campaign of self-enrichment. He has exploited the presidency tomake himself and his family richer, bullied allies and enemies alike into accepting his coercive and erratic foreign policy, and sullied the US’s image around the globe.Trump’s campaign to seize Greenland from Denmark is the endpoint of his transactional and corrupt approach to governing since he returned to office: an attempt to use the immense financial and military power of the American state to strong-arm a property deal that he believes will enhance his legacy. What other modern real estate mogul can claim to have achieved such a prize, securing a territory of 836,000 square miles – three times the size of Texas?Until his meetings in Davos, Trump had shown little interest in negotiating agreements with Denmark and other Nato allies to expand theexisting US military presencein Greenland, which could include adding bases, radars and ballistic missiles. He had set his goal as nothing short of US ownership of the Danish territory.In an interviewwith the New York Times earlier this month, Trump explained his outlook on control of Greenland in real estate terms, preferring outright ownership to a lease agreement or treaty. “Ownership is very important,” he said, adding: “Because that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success.” When asked if he meant ownership of Greenland was important for himself or for the US, Trump responded: “Psychologically important for me.”It’s the latest example of how Trump, thefirst convicted felonelected president, unleashed his basest instincts in his second term: the state exists to serve the ego of its leader, and if the world refuses to validate him, the world will pay a price. If Denmark continued to insist it won’t sell Greenland, Trump hadrefused to rule outusing military force to seize the territory – until he did so in his speech at Davos.He was also emboldened by the quick US military operation on 3 January that captured Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, with no American casualties. For Trump and his sycophantic aides, US foreign policy is now based on the worldview of might makes right – and they think Europe and itsleaders are too weakto resist American military and economic dominance.To achieve his grand territorial ambitions and soothe his bruised ego over the Nobel peace prize, Trump is willing to fracture the nearly 80-year-old Nato alliance, instigate a transatlantic trade war with Europe, and perhaps even trigger a military confrontation with US allies.How did we get here?When he returned to office last year, Trump gutted federal agencies, fired tens of thousands of government workers and issued dozens of executive orders intended to expand his power. He also rushed to dismantlemany of the lawsand other anti-corruption safeguards put in place by Congress after the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. Trumpfired 17 inspectors generalwho had served as ethics watchdogs over various agencies. He appointed loyalists to run the justice department and FBI, and circumvented Congress toinstall his alliesas top federal prosecutors across the country. Within a few months, Trump had dismantled many mechanisms of accountability designed to impose ethical and legal boundaries – and constrain past US presidents.With little outrage or resistance from Congress and the rest of the political establishment in Washington, Trump was emboldened to expand presidential authority and ignore norms set by his predecessors. Fearful of angering the president and his Maga base, the Republican majority in Congress allowed Trump to infringeon its authorityover government spending and agencies.The US supreme court also paved the way for Trump’s power grab,issuing a rulingin July 2024 which gave him “absolute immunity” from prosecution for his official acts as president. The court’s conservative majority – which Trump helped create by appointing three of its justices during his first term – ruled 6-3 in his favor. In a dissent that now seems prescient, the liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor criticized the majority’s decisionas a “mockery”that could turn the US president into a “king above the law”.“Let the president violate the law, let him exploit the trappings of his office for personal gain, let him use his official power for evil ends,”Sotomayor wrote, citing a leader who might order the US military to assassinate a political rival, organize a coup to hold on to office, or take a bribe in exchange for a pardon – and still receive immunity for all of these acts. She added: “Even if these nightmare scenarios never play out, and I pray they never do, the damage has been done … In every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law.”The lack of checks on Trump, and immunity from potential criminal prosecution, has allowed him not only to reshape the US government and expand his power, but also enabled him to profit from the presidency in unprecedented ways. Thepresident is exemptfrom conflict of interest laws that prohibit federal employees from exploiting their positions for personal profit. Since the Watergate cover-up, which forced Richard Nixon to resign the presidency in 1974, every US president had voluntarily abided by these rules. But in his first term, Trump refused pressure to divest from his business ventures, and argued that his sons had taken control of the Trump Organization.In his second term, Trump has monetized the presidency to an astounding level. By some estimates, he has used the office to makeat least $1.4bnfor himself and his family. That includes millions of dollarsin licensing feespaid to the Trump Organization as part of more than 20 foreign real estate projects, some of which involve foreign governments seeking favor with the US administration. (The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has responded by saying: “Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.”)The largest windfall for Trump has come from new cryptocurrency ventures, especially a $2bn stablecoin project with an investment fund backed by the government of the United Arab Emirates.That project, which could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in profit for the president’s family, was announcedtwo weeks beforeTrump allowed the UAE access to buy advanced computer chips critical for AI development.With no guardrails or opposition to prevent Trump’s massive power grab and personal self-enrichment, is it any surprise that he had threatened US allies with economic warfare unless they agreed to sell Greenland and help him achieve his territorial conquest? Trump is transforming the US from a superpower into a protection racket ruled by his whims.For the past year, Trump has grown more vindictive, narcissistic and erratic – and a greater danger not just to America, but to the world.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS foreign policyTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But that didn’t stop many claiming to make sense of itThu 22 Jan 2026 10.11 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 16.02 ESTShareIn weeks like this, the mask slips somewhat. Politicians love the illusion of control. It’s the special power that differentiates them from us lower orders. They are the ones pulling all the levers. Nothing ever happens that takes them unawares. They are the ones with answers to everything. They need it to be this way. Not just for their own psyches but for ours. It’s somehow comforting.And then along comesDonald Trumpand our emperors have no clothes. Their limitations on view to everyone. Scrabbling around just to stand still. Trying to make sense of the world in real time, just like the rest of us. Making it up as they go along.To be fair, there is no shame in this. Their real crime is to pretend they know what they are doing the rest of the time. Let’s face it: The Donald doesn’t know what The Donald is going to do or say from one day to the next, so it’s hardly likely that anyone else will. He isn’t even sure ifGreenlandis Iceland. Hell, they’ve both got land in them. Watch out, England. The only certainty is uncertainty, much as politicians wish it were otherwise.It’s been quite the few days. At the weekend the US president was threatening the UK and seven other European countries with tariffs for sending troops to Greenland, a few days after he had demanded Nato countries send troops to Greenland. Go figure. There may be a mind somewhere in Trump’s brain but it’s been scrambled. The synapses haven’t met in years. There’s life, Jim, but not as we know it.Trump paints himself as great white hope in racism-drenched Davos speechRead moreThen The Donald threatened a military invasion and started posting mock-ups of Greenland and Canada as US states, while trash-talking his Nato allies. Ina hard-to-follow, borderline psychotic speech at Davos, he then said he wouldn’t take Greenland by force but he still wanted to buy it and he wouldn’t forget who had tried to stop him.Then, just as world leaders were trying to catch their breath and work out all the angles, late on Wednesday he popped up on social media to say he had had a meeting with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, and everything was now cool. He didn’t want to annex Greenland after all, as they had come to a deal. Probably the very best deal in the whole history of deals. Certainly the best deal since the last deal that Trump has done. Better even thanending the eight wars that he hasn’t ended.Cue much surprise and chaos as politicians tried to make sense of a global order that was being rewritten in real time. Everyone eager to get the best hot take. Some, mostly American, claimed it as a triumph for Trump. The Art of the Deal made flesh. Go in hard, disrupt and sucker your opponents into giving you what you had always wanted. Others called it classicTaco. Trump Always Chickens Out. The president had gone to the brink and then blinked when he couldn’t get his own way.Come Thursday morning in the UK, it was the foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, who was sent out on the media round to explain it all from the government’s insider position. On the Today programme, Amol Rajan got straight to the point. What had been agreed? There was a long pause. Far longer than the two-second delay on communications from Davos. Er … it had been the result of determined diplomacy. An unwavering adherence to the highest principles. Nato working at its best.Rajan sounded understandably confused. Please remind our listeners, he said: what exactly was the deal again? Again a lengthy pause. Determined diplomacy. An unwavering adherence to the highest principles. Nato working at its best. At which point, the penny dropped. Yvette didn’t have any more idea what the deal was than the rest of us. She was completely in the dark.It could be anything or nothing. Rutte might just have reminded the president that under a 1951 treaty he was already entitled to have US sovereign bases on Greenland along with some mineral rights. Marco Rubio might have persuaded Trump to back downafter falls in the stock market. Or Trump might just have got bored with Greenland. He had concentrated on it for nearly five days, which was already way beyond his mental capacity. He was on to the next thing. Hey, Greenland was no place for a summer vacation.Then Cooper hit her groove. She could put her own spin on the vacuum of knowledge. We shouldn’t worry too much about what the deal was. After all, in Trumpworld any deal could be ripped up in days. I mean, having a vague outline of a deal was, on balance, better than not having a vague outline of a deal. But let’s keep things in the day. Or hour.UK not ready to sign up to Donald Trump’s ‘board of peace’, says Yvette CooperRead moreWhat we really needed to understand was that, if there was a vague deal, it was all down to Keir Starmer. It had been Keir’s steadfast support for the sovereignty of Greenland that had shifted the dial. Brilliant. Because there wasn’t anyone around who would contradict that. In a world of relative truths, where there are any number of realities, there was a parallel universe in which Keir was the ultimate Trump whisperer. And no, we weren’t about to be dragged in to The Donald’s latest distraction. Have you seen some of the undesirableson the “board of peace”? she asked Sky News. We did have principles. Good to know.Over in Davos, there was one other UK politician giving his reaction to the Greenland deal or no deal. Step forward Nigel Farage, who was giving an interview to Bloomberg first thing in the morning. Nige knew even less than most, though that wasn’t going to stop him pretending he did. “Mark Carney has been wrong about everything,” he said.That’s odd, replied the interviewer, Stephanie Flanders. Because everyone else reckons the Canadian prime minister has played a blinder. Telling it as it is. That as long as Trump is in the White House we can no longer count on international law and a united Nato. Nige shrugged. What the past week had shown was a fragmentation into national interests. Weird. Most of us had seen a more or less united Europe. Almost as if the Reform leader was enjoying being wilfully wrong. There again, the only contributions Farage has admitted enjoying at Davos over the years were those of Trump and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. So he was in good company.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe politics sketchGreenlandcommentShareReuse this content"

Consider the copious amounts of evidenceThu 22 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 06.02 ESTShareWhich way, western man?That was the title of aracist tractpublished in 1978 by William Gayley Simpson, a former leftist Christian pastor turned one of the most influential neo-Nazi ideologues in American history. The bookhelped radicalizean entire generation of white supremacists in the US, with its vicious antisemitism, opposition to all forms of immigration and open praise for Hitler. The purpose of the book,wroteSimpson, was “to reveal organized Jewry as a world power entrenched in every country of the white man’s world, operating freely across every nation’s frontiers, and engaged in a ruthless war for the destruction of them all”.In recent decades, Which way, western man? has become a popular meme – but only on the far-right fringes of the internet.Until, that is, the return of Donald Trump to the White House. Last August, the X account of Trump’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS)postedan ICE recruitment poster featuring an Uncle Sam figure holding a “law and order” sign while standing by a crossroads post featuring arrows reading “invasion” and “cultural decline”. The DHS caption? “Which way, American man?”We ran high-level US civil war simulations. Minnesota is exactly how they start | Claire FinkelsteinRead moreShocking? Yes. Coincidence? Nope. Earlier this month, the official White House Twitter accountposteda cartoon of Greenlandic huskies with Danish flags on their sleds facing a choice between the White House on one side and China’s Great Wall and Russia’s Red Square on the other. The White House’s caption? “Which way, Greenland man?”It should be one of the biggest stories in the United States, if not the world. Eighty years after the death of Hitler and the defeat of Nazi Germany, the US government, in the form of theTrump administration, has aNaziproblem.Think I’m exaggerating? Consider the copious amounts of evidence. On social media, as recent investigations byCNN,NBC NewsandPBS NewsHourhave all confirmed, official government accounts can’t stop posting Nazi imagery and memes, usingdehumanizing languageabout migrants, andleaning heavilyinto fascist aesthetics.The Department of Laborposteda video with the caption “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage”, recalling the Nazi slogan “Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer” (“one people, one realm, one leader”). Another tweet from the Department of Laborannouncedthat “America is for Americans,” which sounds a lot like another notorious Nazi slogan: “Deutschland den Deutschen (“Germany for Germans”).And the Nazi rhetoric goes far beyond internet memes. Earlier this month, DHS secretary Kristi Noem stood behind a podium whichsaid“One of ours, all of yours” – a phrase that “seems related to the practice (although not the explicit policy) of collective punishment used by the Nazis against their enemies”,accordingto Holocaust historian Page Herrlinger. Last year, the White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller gave ademagogic speechat Charlie Kirk’s memorial service that sounded like it had beenplagiarizedfrom Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels’s 1932 speechThe Storm is Coming.Even the myth-busting websiteSnopescould not help but “observe the similarities” between Miller and Goebbels’s fascist rhetoric.Then there is the staffing issue. In February 2025, itemergedthat James Rodden, an ICE prosecutor in Texas, had been running a social media accountpraisingHitler anddeclaringthat “America is a white nation”. This is a federal prosecutor – not a teenager or a troll – pushing Nazi ideology. He was pulled from his post after the story first broke, but this month itappearshe returned to work. When the Texas Observer, which broke the story, called Rodden for comment, he had none, andreferredreporters to his press office.Then there’s Paul Ingrassia, the former White House liaison to the DHS now serving as acting general counsel at the General Services Administration, who once allegedlydeclaredin a group chat: “I do have a Nazi streak in me from time to time, I will admit it.” In June 2024, he was alsospottedat a rally in Detroit headlined byHolocaust denierNick Fuentes. (In a statement to Politico, Ingrassia’s attorney said about alleged leaked text messages: “Looks like these texts could be manipulated or are being provided with material context omitted. However, arguendo, even if the texts are authentic, they clearly read as self-deprecating and satirical humor making fun of the fact that liberals outlandishly and routinely call Maga supporters ‘Nazis’.”)There’s also Ed Martin, the pardon attorney at the Trump DoJ, who appeared at multiple events with a 6 January rioter called Timothy Hale-Cusanelli andreferredto him as an “amazing guy”, “extraordinary leader”, and “great friend”. Hale-Cusanelli wasdescribedby federal prosecutors as a “Nazi sympathizer” who went to work in a “Hitler mustache”. (Martin has since gone on todistancehimself from Hale-Cusanelli after scrutiny and hascondemnedhis views.)How does this rhetoric and behavior from Trump administration officials and social media accountsnotamount to the normalization of Nazis and Nazism? And how are the rest of us supposed to be OK with any of this?As ever, the rot of course starts at the top with Trump himself. His own vice-president oncesuggestedhe might be “America’s Hitler” (regarding his vocal critiques of Trump, he has since said“I was wrong”). Trump’s first wifesaidhe kept a book of Hitler’s speeches in a cabinet by his bed. (Trump said he was “given the book by a friend”.) Trump has repeatedly used language lifted straight out of the pages of Mein Kampf, denouncing his political opponents as“vermin”and accusing immigrants of“poisoning the blood”of the nation.In 2022, hehostedYe, aHitler admirer, and Fuentes, theHolocaust denier, for dinner at Mar-a-Lago. (While Trump has reportedlydistancedhimself from Fuentes, he stopped short of condemning or denouncing him.) During his first term, the president’s own former chief of staff claimed Trumpspokeadmiringly of Hitler and said he did “some good things”. (In a lawsuit against CNN, Trump alleged that any suggestion that he “would be Hitler-like in any future political role” is “false and incendiary”, as it is to suggest any association between [himself] and Hitler”. The lawsuit was dismissed.)To be clear: this isn’t about calling everyone the left disagrees with a Nazi, as Trump administration spokespersons like toclaim; it’s about recognizing when actual Nazis are not just right in front of us butin power. So here’s a simple rule for Trump and his friends: if you don’t want to be called Nazis, stop hiring Nazis, quoting Nazis and posting Nazi imagery.But don’t expect any of that to stop any time soon. In his first term, the president praised neo-Nazis as“very fine people”and then his acolytes spent yearsdesperately denyinghe had ever done so. Today, there is very little denial, shame, or contrition. The United States government under Trump has made a deliberate, calculated, and shameful decision to embolden and enable Nazi-glorifying elements within his party; to elevate and amplify Nazi messaging.Don’t take my word for it. Last year, Dalton Henry Stout, founder of the neo-Nazi Aryan Freedom Network,saidthe quiet part out loud: “[Trump] awakened a lot of people to the issues we’ve been raising for years. He’s the best thing that’s happened to us.”Stout went even further: “Our side won the election.”Mehdi Hasan is the editor-in-chief and CEO ofZeteoExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The EU must join forces with Canada, Japan and other like-minded countriesThu 22 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 10.26 ESTShareEU leaders would do well to meditate on the seminal lesson that the Canadian prime minister,Mark Carney, deliveredat this year’s World Economic Forum.In an incisive analysis of the new age of predatory great powers, where might is increasingly asserted as right, Carney not only accurately defined the coarsening of international relations as “a rupture, not a transition”. He also outlined how liberal democratic “middle powers” such as Canada – but also European countries – must build coalitions to counter coercion and defend as much as possible of the principles of territorial integrity, the rule of law, free trade, climate action and human rights. He spelled out a hedging strategy that Canada is already pursuing, diversifying its trade and supply chains and evenopening its marketto Chinese electric vehicles to counter Donald Trump’s tariffs on Canadian-made automobiles.Carney’s clear-eyed recognition that the age of the western-led “rules-based international order” – with all its flaws and inconsistencies – is not coming back contrasts with dithering among European leaders, many of whom still seem to believe they can flatter, bribe and appease Trump into taking their interests into account. Fear of Trumpstorming out of Natoorabandoning Ukraineto Russian dismemberment has so far prevented them from taking a strong stance against his bullying of allies.The US president’s insistence on takingpossession of Greenland, and his threat ofpunitive tariffsagainst European allies who sent a small reconnaissance force to Greenland last week in support of Denmark, should be the red line that finally triggers a united and firm European response. Yet nothing is less certain, with EU leaders still torn between de-escalation and bargaining on the one hand, and escalation to create a balance of power before any negotiation, on the other.Trump muddied the waters after giving a belligerent speech in Davos, by announcing he had “formed the framework of a future deal” on Greenland in talks with Nato’s Mark Rutte and would not, after all, be imposing those threatened additional tariffs. But Europeans should not be lulled into dropping their guard.Carney’s lesson inDavoscould not have been clearer and more timely. “When we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness. We accept what’s offered. We compete with each other to be the most accommodating,” he warned. “This is not sovereignty. It’s the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination. In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice – compete with each other for favour, or combine to create a third path with impact.”In other words, Europe can only hope to stop Trump’s abuse of US power if it acts with unity and strength, and joins forces with like-minded countries such asCanada, but also Japan, Australia, Brazil and India, to build new trade pacts and rules.EU leaders hold an emergency summit on Thursday evening in response to Trump’s demand to take control of Greenland from Denmark. They must give their support for Denmark teeth by agreeing to slapretaliatory tariffson US goods worth €93bn if Trumptakes any further action against EU members. Moreover, they should begin the process of activating their “trade bazooka”, the anti-coercion instrument that allows wide-ranging economic and regulatory measures against a foreign power trying to coerce Europe. This would start with inviting the European Commission to open an investigation into US moves to coerce an EU member.The European parliament took a first step to charge Washington an economic price for Trump’s threats this week by postponing indefinitely a vote to ratify tariff cuts on US goods that were part of the humiliating unequal trade “deal” that the US president forced on the EU last year. However, MEPs then proceeded to shoot the EU’s trade-diversification strategy in the foot by voting to send a long-delayed trade pact with four dynamic South American economies in the Mercosur group for judicial review by the European court of justice. That surrender to beef farmers who wield outsize political power will delay ratification by about two years and sends a chilling message to other countries lining up to clinch trade agreements with Brussels.The commission now faces a sensitive decision on whether to forfeit the economic benefits of the Mercosur deal, or defy the legislature by provisionally implementing it, as provided in the agreement, pending the court’s decision and eventual ratification.The most important message from Carney is that political leaders must deal with the world as it is, not as they wish it would be. “Nostalgia is not a strategy,” he warned. European leaders would be wrong to cling to the comfort blanket of old-fashioned Atlanticism in the misguided belief that one more compliment or concession to Trump will slake his insatiable appetite. For a start, no European leader should agree to join his so-called “board of peace”, which is a transparent attempt to cement US hegemony, outside international law and the UN.Now is the time for Europe to embrace a painful emancipation, and seek partners around the world to keep the torch of rules-based governance and trade burning.

Good reform rarely emerges from high emotion, haste and political horse-trading. And yet these are the conditions under which the government’s new hate speech lawswere enacted by the parliament this week. And all before the recently establishedroyal commission on antisemitism and social cohesionhas had a chance to even beginits investigations.We know that two men targeted a Hanukah celebration at Bondi beach, took 15 lives, injured many more and caused deep trauma to Australia’s Jewish community. But so far we don’t know anything about the role “hate speech” may have played in motivating the violence perpetrated by those men, or whether so-called “hate groups” exerted an influence. (Note that Islamic State is already a proscribed terrorist organisation in Australia and no new laws were required to criminalise their activities.)So, apart from the neo-Nazi National Socialist Network (NSN), which claims to have disestablished itself before these new laws came into operation, who will bear the brunt of the new national laws that ban “hate groups” and criminalise leading, recruiting for, or being a member of such a group? Hizb ut-Tahrir has been identified as a candidate, but it seems unlikely that this complex regime was introduced for that organisation alone.Banning organisations has a sorry history – does Australia really want to go down this road again? | Anne TwomeyRead moreOrganisers of Palestinian solidarity protests across Australia are rightly wondering: is all this for us? Are we at risk of being labelled aprohibited “hate group”if we engage in legitimate criticism of Israel or the actions of the Israeli government?The words coming from senior figures within the Albanese government in the wake of the passage of the new laws are hardly reassuring. On one hand, the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, said he didn’t believe it would be possible “in any way, shape or form” that protesters expressing criticism of actions of the Israeli government would fall foul of the commonwealth’s new hate crime laws.On the other hand, on the ABC’s 7.30 program, the attorney general, Michelle Rowland, struggled to give a clear answer on whether a group that accused Israel of genocide or asserted that Israel should not exist could be declared a “hate group”, and eventually conceded it was possible.All of this just days after the prime minister announced the government would be dropping what had become the most controversial of the proposed new criminal laws – the creation of a new offence of intentionally inciting racial hatred – having listened to the free speech concerns expressed in various quarters (most notably, the federal opposition) and conceding this doomed the original bill to failure in parliament.There appears to be some sleight of hand here too, for which all who voted for the revised bill must take responsibility. Even though a racist incitement offence hasnotbeen added to the commonwealth criminal code, the enlarged conception of “hate crime”, on which the new hate group proscription regime turns, includes not only the multiple racist violence offences now contained in the federal criminal code, but incitement of racial hatred offences in states that have taken the step of introducing them (Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales).So, a group may be declared a “hate group” under national law for conduct that the Australian parliament has decided is insufficiently serious to be expressly criminalised.I have no sympathy for individuals or organisations that intentionally incite antisemitic hatred – or hatred directed at any group, whether defined by race, religion, sexuality, gender or disability. I have spent 30 years making the case for appropriately balanced hate speech laws. But I do think we need to moderate our expectations on how much ever-expanding forms of criminalisation can deliver the community safety and social cohesion to which we aspire.We must also recognise both the harms that can be done by hastily widening the net cast by the criminal law, and that there are often better ways of encouraging public discourse that is both robust and respectful.The legitimate cause of antisemitism prevention can be advanced without imperilling Australia’s long history of respect for non-violent public protest as an important (indeed, laudable) form of democratic participation.Protestorganisers, and those who choose to participate in public assemblies and marches, are entitled to hear clear and consistent reassurances from our government leaders that Australians are perfectly capable of doing both at the same time.Luke McNamara is a professor in the faculty of law and justice at the University of NSW and a member of the Centre for Criminology, Law and JusticeExplore more on these topicsAustralian politicsOpinionAntisemitismFreedom of speechProtestAustralian lawBondi beach terror attackcommentShareReuse this content"

Back in the Lords tomorrow and then for seven more Fridays, at this pace there is no chance it will get through in time, unless the blockers give up immediately.The Tories plotting against the bill are a gleeful Lords reunion of the old Brexit gang – Michael Gove, David Frost, Mark Harper and Thérèse Coffey – reprising the same dirty tricks with the same cunning. They know the loss will humiliate Labour and Starmer, who gave time for this private member’s bill. Absurdly, opponents deny this is a filibuster, but watch them tomorrow in the Lords and see them talk very slowly, making identical speeches on identical or crass amendments. Last week, they piled into the preceding debate on the agenda to waste maximum time before assisted dying came up. I’ve never seen any of them show any interest before in a bill on rare cancers, but suddenly they grew loquacious.Some chief filibusterers, such as Ilora Finlay, are at least driven by religious belief. Tanni Grey-Thompson also fiercely opposes the bill, fearing ill treatment of those with disabilities, though research suggests a similar proportion of disabled people want the right to an assisted death as most voters.Despite never-ending negotiations and near-impossible conditions, opponents make zero compromise.Look how toughthe billis: those within six months of dying can ask for help (only in writing) to speed their ending, from two doctors seven days apart. After another wait, a panel of a psychiatrist, social worker and senior lawyer must agree, and the patient must be able to take the drug themselves with a doctor present. Many safeguards were added, andclinicians are free not to participate. Evidence from the many countries with similar laws shows that relatively few people use it, but most approaching death are comforted to know if the agony becomes unbearable, they can choose to end it.A reminder of what terrible deaths await the most unfortunate. (Don’t read this if you’re too squeamish to face the horrors some suffer, untreatable even by the best palliative care.) Professionals who see these things compiled a report, theInescapable Truth, revealing agonies hidden from most of us: “Some will retch at the stench of their own body rotting. Some will vomit their own faeces. Some will suffocate, slowly, inexorably, over several days.” An average of 17 people a day are dying these bad deaths, according to 2019 figures. Good palliative care works wonders, but not always. About650 suicidesof those who are dying are recorded every year; there may be more of these lonely, unassisted deaths.Amendments to the bill have been clumped into 84 groups. So far, only 12 have been debated, very slowly. Some are absurd beyond belief, some transparent attempts to waste time: amendment no 578 and eight others would replace “substance” with “substance and mixture”.No 458would make every patient take a pregnancy test. No 15 bars anyone who has been abroad in the last year, so forget a bucket list. Nos701 and 713suggest clinical trials for the “substance” used. How do you carry out a randomised control trial on a life-ending drug?Three-quarters of the publicback the right to die, and their lordships should rememberthere is also strong supportfor radical reforms that would remove most current incumbents. The 24 bishops are a small part of the unrepresentative religious peers on the red benches in this increasingly secular country. Expect their killing of this bill to stoke demand for an end to the Lords – a demand the government should listen to.The bill will die in mid-May, at the end of this parliament. The government could use the Parliament Act to force it through without the Lords, but it would pass in exactly the form it left the Commons, with no added amendments. And what a precedent to set before a possible Nigel Farage succession. Or the government could put it into the king’s speech for the next session, making it a government bill. There is no sign yet of either happening. It’s said that Starmer worries about two religious figures in his cabinet who are outspoken opponents, but Wes Streeting and Shabana Mahmood have had their shout and would hardly resign over this.Otherwise, any hope for this long-delayed reform relies on the luck of the next ballot for private members’ bills. Even if a supporter of assisted dying comes top, any MP may blanch at what this has done to Kim Leadbeater. For more than a year, her life has been consumed by the longest scrutiny committees, amid vitriolic hate from opponents, for authoring and promoting this most minimalist of bills.Over many years I have written about the right to die when we choose. After the Commons vote, I said: “I hope I never need to again.” But if the government lacks the spine, there will be a lot more to say.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That has consequences for us allNatasha WalterFor a decade, the autonomous territory in Syria has been a bastion of gender equality. It holds important lessons for the fight against authoritarianismThu 22 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 09.49 ESTShareAyear ago, I was in north-eastSyria, in the Kurdish-dominated area known as Rojava, listening to some of the most determined women that I have ever met. On my first day there, I went to a huge conference where one after another, women in Kurdish, Arab and Assyrian dress roused the audience to chants of “Jin! Jiyan! Azadi!” (Woman! Life! Freedom)!.When I visited, this region of Syria had for more than a decade been governed not by Bashar al-Assad’s regime, but by anautonomous administration(the Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, orDaanes). Itscommitment to equal rightshas been remarkable – every institution it set up relied on power-sharing between men and women. No wonder many of the women I met there sounded optimistic about their future. “This will be a century of women’s freedom,” one said to me. “We are in solidarity with women in resistance throughout the world.”Now, I’m getting messages from these women that speak of their despair. They say the future is dark. They speak of betrayal by the west. They say they face slaughter.This autonomous region is being throttled, as the Syrian government, led byAhmed al-Sharaa, is trying to bring the whole country under its control. The Kurds in north-east Syria are right to fear what that control would look like:massacres of other minorities, including Alawites and Druze, have taken place recently elsewhere in the country. Al-Sharaa, with hisbackground in al-Qaidaand desire for a centralised national government, represents the polar opposite of the secular, decentralised ideals of the autonomous administration.As government forces advance, theterritory controlled by the administrationhas already shrunk dramatically. Those parts of north-east Syria where Kurds are not in the majority have slipped away, and even the key Kurdish areas are under threat.The messages that I’m receiving from women in Rojava are heartbreaking. But they are also speaking of their ongoing determination to defend the achievements of north-east Syria. Nobody should dismiss their determination as mere talk. The region’s armies, led by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and including theWomen’s Protection Units(YPJ), the women’s army, fought to destroy Islamic State.As I write, a patchy ceasefire is holding and the administration’s spokespeople state they still hope that negotiations might bring about a settlement that preserves the rights and freedoms of theKurdsand other minorities. But there is no glossing over the fact that the future for the region looks bleak. And what happens there matters well beyond its shifting borders. Because Rojava has long had the power to inspire beyond its territory.Many anarchists and socialists have been galvanised over the years by the administration’s stated commitment to try to create abottom-up, decentralisedpolitical system. For sure, the administration often struggled to put these radical ideals into practice. Human rights abuses and repression of dissent were still reported; many Arab people in the region reported that power was, in practice, held only by the Kurds. It is important not to romanticise Rojava and to recognise that gaps existed between rhetoric and reality.But where its ideas worked out, they were transformative. They ensured decisions were taken closer to the ground, by those directly affected – whether that was the distribution of food in a displaced people’s camp or the reformation of the legal system with an emphasis on restorative justice.Meanwhile, the administration’s commitment to gender equality was clearly building a true counterweight to patriarchal practices. The feminism I found there was not the same as western feminism. Kurdish women drew inspiration from their own traditions – from ancient Mesopotamia towomen’s participation in Kurdish strugglesthroughout the region.The intellectual confidence among the women I met struck me hard – and I don’t mean just the writers or teachers. I mean all the women: from soldiers to judges, from women working in a textile factory to those on an agricultural committee. They were rereading feminist writers from Nawal El Saadawi to Virginia Woolf, Sakine Cansiz to Rosa Luxemburg, taking their ideas apart to see what they could use in practice, examining the limits of western liberalism when it came to women’s rights, and how feminism and socialism could work together.This energetic reforging of the theory and practice of feminism couldn’t be more alien to the forces that are now confronting Rojava. All the powers that are rising around the globe right now, from Donald Trump’s US to al-Sharaa’s Syria, from Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Turkey to Vladimir Putin’s Russia, are ready to trample women’s rights underfoot alongside their disregard for democracy.The question of how people can build a counterweight to growing authoritarianism has never been more urgent.Womenand men in north-east Syria have been putting their energy into trying to answer that question for years. And now it’s up to all of us who admired that energy to think about how we can show solidarity. That can involve using our voices to pressure our government to support the rights of women and minorities in the region, and to rein in the Damascus government’s repressive ambitions. It can involve engaging with the ideas and practices of direct democracy that characterise the region’s governance at its best. And it can also involve trying to build a more collective and confident feminism in our own societies.Natasha Walter is the author of Before the Light Fades and Living Dolls: the Return of SexismDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But knowing there are famous people suffering steadies meRebecca ShawHow can a Normal understand what it feels like to turn my head and suddenly feel like the floor has smashed violently into my face?Thu 22 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 18.00 ESTShareAcouple of years ago I experienced something that turned my world upside down. I mean that literally (and I mean literally literally). I experienced vertigo. Specifically benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.I personally have a huge issue with the inclusion of the word “benign”, just because something isn’t going to kill you doesn’t mean it’s not going to make you feel like you might die. Trying to explain BPPV makes me sound like a spiritual healer, because it happens when tiny crystals in your inner ear shift out of place. Yes, tiny crystals. The shifting of the tiny crystals tells your brain that your body is tumbling in space, but in a fun twist – it isn’t. The earth can suddenly and completely jolt off its axis while you are standing still, let alone turning your head.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsThe power these tiny crystals have to mess up your life, not to mention your physical perspective, is unbelievable. I’d compare it to when you’re so drunk the room is jumping and spinning (assume we’ve all been there), combined with a theme park ride where you suddenly get turned upside down and your stomach drops to your throat. For this reason, discovering other people who have it and understand it is so validating it brings a tear to the (involuntarily moving) eye.My girlfriend is supportive as a partner, but completely baffled by my love of sports | Rebecca ShawRead moreI have been going through a vertigo episode recently, which sucks, but I also recently found out that another talented successful legend like me is afflicted: Australian cricketer Steve Smith. Smithrecently missedan entire test match against England because of vertigo. When I read about this I was sad for him, but I also … felt good. Vertigo has become an ongoing issue in my life, and I get some sympathy, but I could take a whole lot more. How can a Normal understand what it feels like to turn my head and suddenly feel like the carpeted floor has smashed violently into my face, simultaneously making me scream and vomit? Or how it feels to walk into a cafe on a rainy day, slip on the wet floor and fall down in front of everyone – activating my vertigo and causing me to vomit, also in front of everyone. Yes that’s real. I’ve seen a lot of my own vomit throughout this experience, and Steve Smith understands. He’s been struggling with vertigo for a while. In 2020 he said: “The doctor, I think he performed six Epley manoeuvres on me this morning and got the crystals out of my ears and I was struggling for a bit.”The Epley manoeuvre is a treatment where you deliberately give yourself vertigo by turning over and over in a specific pattern, in an attempt to send those crystals back to their little home. It helps a lot of vertigo victims like Steve, but unfortunately hasn’t worked for me. It’s like if you put the girl from the exorcist on the Gravitron. Vomit sprays out of me as I turn like a crying rotisserie chicken, while my poor girlfriend leaps around trying to catch it in a bucket (to win a prize). The last time I tried this I ended up in the hospital. The nurse checking me in had experienced vertigo, genuinely commiserated with me, and got me seen fast. This could also have been due to the fact that my vomiting sounds in the bathroom next door were reverberating powerfully around the waiting room. Sorry to keep talking about vomit but it’s an integral part of having vertigo.I feel a connection to Smith, and to anyone else who has suffered in the specific way we have. It works for other things besides vertigo of course. I recently saw aBill Hader interviewwhere he talked about how shingles should be a bigger deal and renamed “fire blisters”. I had shingles a couple of years ago – another, different pain hell – and I know how much bizarre and freakish nerve pain Hader was in.I’m sure this is the same for many people and many conditions. You have to find your way through it using all the tools you have. It doesn’t fix anything to know that other people go through it, even if they are famous, but it does make me feel a little bit less lonely – and that steadies me. Until I turn my head.Rebecca Shaw is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsSteve SmithOpinionHealth & wellbeingHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

It shouldn’t be too much to ask. And yet, if the polls are to be believed, the United Kingdom is in a very interesting position. By the end of May, it is likely that the largest party in three of the four constituent countries of the UK will want the larger polity in which they operate to break apart.The SNP is currently theoverwhelming favouriteto have the most seats in the Scottish parliament in the upcoming elections. In Wales, there was polling last week suggesting that the Welshnationalist partyPlaid Cymru was on course to be the largest party inside the Welsh Senedd, justfour seats short of a majority. Even more astonishing is that the Welsh Green party was also predicted to get 11 of the 96 seats. This would mean that there would be a majority of parties inside the Welsh parliament whose official policy was for Welsh independence. In Northern Ireland, the party with the most seats at present is Sinn Féin.Now, if you were an introspective member of the UK government you might think, “Hmmm, clearly something isn’t working here. IfWales, which has long been apathetic to independence, is flirting with the idea, perhaps we need to have a rethink?” But of all the things you can call the Starmer administration, “introspective” is not one of them. I know from conversations with Labour people that they see the support for the pro-independence Plaid and Greens in Wales as a “kicking of the establishment” rather than an endorsement of breaking up the UK. They point to polling regarding Welsh independence that has constantly hovered around the 30% mark in recent years.They are partly correct in this assessment. Many people who are planning to vote Plaid Cymru in the elections in May are not advocates for an independent Wales. You can see this by the fact that Plaid’s leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth, is deliberately putting talk about Welsh independence on the back burner as he tries to win over traditional Labour voters. Instead, he simply talks of a “higher ambition” of Wales.He told me last week: “I don’t think we’re quite in a place where we would win a referendum on independence.” But when you think about it, doesn’t this underscore more than anything that the UK, as currently constituted, isn’t working? Voters are willing to risk the UK itself, such is their level of frustration with the status quo.If you consider yourself a unionist and want the UK to continue, you should be very concerned that we are getting to a point where three-quarters of the countries within it have large numbers of voters that don’t want the UK to exist, or at least are willing to tolerate that outcome.So what can the UK government do about it? Well, ultimately you need the UK to work for all of its component parts, and have the structures of governance reflect the reality that it is a union of four nations. This has to start with recalibrating our preconceptions about how a state should look. The UK ishighly centralised. This doesn’t work for Wales,Scotland or Northern Ireland, but it also doesn’t work for many parts of England.At present, we have a ridiculous situation where the House of Commons doubles as both the parliament of the UK, and the parliament of England. The prime minister of England also doubles up as the prime minister of the whole of the UK. This is not ideal. The governor of California can’t also be the president of the US. There are clearly conflicting priorities.When it comes to funding, the current structures look as if they were drawn up on the back of the fag packet by a fresher at uni. We have a funding system for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that is entirely based on the spending priorities of the UK government in England. The Welsh government has less borrowing powersthan a local council, and it often publishes its final budget nine monthsinto the financial year, because the Treasury has decided to change funding in England. This doesn’t work. And it can’t work.While the system is failing Wales, it is perhaps even worse forcertain regions of England. At least Wales gets funding automatically allocated, whereas many parts of Englandhave to fightfor individual funding pots.At the start of 2024, the independent commission on the constitutional future of Walespublished its report, setting out 10 recommendations designed to strengthen Welsh democracy and protect devolution. It was led by Prof Laura McAllister from Cardiff University and the former archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. It called for better safeguards for devolution (at the moment Westminster can technically scrap Welsh democracy without any input from the people of Cymru); reducing the constraints on the Welsh government budget management; and the devolution of policing and justice – powers Scotland currently has, but Wales doesn’t.The best way to secure the future of the UK is to make it work for the people of the UK. To do this would involve a bold rethink of how we make it a state fit for the present day rather than the arcane hodgepodge of inertia and tradition that it currently is. Does the UK government have the energy to do this? Probably not. Does it have the intellectual chops to pull it off? I doubt it.It will probably argue that people don’t care about constitutional structures and instead want it to focus on “bread and butter issues”. But how the UK is constituted directly shapes how you can fix these bread and butter problems. Imagine if your house was on fire and you were trying to put it out with a Super Soaker. You would instantly realise that your tools aren’t up to the task and get a hose. Well, this is the situation we have in the UK right now. The houseis on fire, but the UK government insists on using just a water pistol, and then it wonders why people want to move out of the house.Will Hayward is a Guardian columnist.

Suddenly, Britain’s newest political force doesn’t look quite so potent or relevant. Instead, it seems old.And what of their prize new signing Robert Jenrick appearing on our TV screens and declaring that Britain is broken? I would love to know how many screams he prompted in living rooms across the land: “Yes – and you broke it mate!”It feels as if the overinflated bubble around the new British right could be about to burst. By embracing the dregs of the Tory party, Reform UK is abandoning its claims that it is a friend of the working class and revealing itself to be a full-on Thatcherite force with added Trumpian fervour.For the British left, this presents an initiative to be seized. If the question at the centre of British politics is “who broke Britain?”, let’s be clear and unequivocal. The four horsemen of Britain’s apocalypse are deindustrialisation, privatisation, austerity and Brexit.In my time in politics, there has been a tendency for too many inLabourto accept too much of the framing of the right, but we must firmly reject its narrative and call it out in no uncertain terms. Figures on the British right talk of taking back control, but people can see that they are the ones who gave it away.After the deindustrialisation of the 1980s, Thatcher’s deregulation and privatisation created a race to the bottom. They left people and businesses paying way over the odds for the essentials and are the root cause of today’s cost-of-living crisis. This was compounded by theselloff of council homes, leaving Britain in the grip of a worsening housing crisis. As a result, the country’s ability to control its costs has been severely weakened. For instance, it has no option but to use the benefits system to fund unregulated rents in the private rented sector.Westminster be warned – Britain’s future will be decided in the north. Get on the right side of that | Andy BurnhamRead moreThese structural weaknesses in our economy were to some degree masked by the higher growth we had in the EU. But the combined effects of austerity and Brexit in the 2010s laid them bare. Our cities and towns were hollowed out and the country has been trapped ever since in alow-growth doom loop. People’s alienation from politics has grown as our archaic, adversarial political system has struggled to find long-term solutions. So we are stuck in a rut and in hock to the bond markets because of the resulting volatility and uncertainty.To be clear: these comments are a criticism of the British right and not the Labour government. It took us to this place. The government has made important pro-growth moves, such as last week’s announcementon Northern Powerhouse Rail. But now is the moment in this parliament to make a clearer case about exactly who broke Britain and lay out bolder fixes.We hope what has been happening in Manchester might offer inspiration. Over the past decade, we have become more and more functional as the country has become dysfunctional. We have used devolution to build a new, more collaborative political culture that is the polar opposite of the Westminster and Whitehall world.On the back of it, we have begun to roll back some of the worst aspects of the 1980s. We haveretaken public control of our busesand will soon reach a new tipping point where we are building more council and social homes than we are losing through right to buy.We are taking a long-term approach to rebuilding an economy devastated by the deindustrialisation of the Thatcher era. We have been growing at double the rate of the UK average and this week set out plansto reindustrialise our city regionin the next period through the development of five global clusters.We are laying out new paths for our young people into these new industries as part of a plan for an education system that offers an equal alternative to the university route. And, by supporting more of our residents to access opportunity in what is thefastest-growing city-region economyin the UK, we are showing that it is possible to make more effective use of public funds, reducing crisis spending in the long term.“Manchesterism” is a modern and functional response to the high-inequality, low-growth trap that came from the 1980s drive to privatise economic power and overcentralise political power in the Treasury. It is about creating a new politics to plot our way out of that and develop a new economy.Replicating this thinking at a national level could mean putting electoral reform centre stage as the means to create a more collaborative politics and consensus on the public investment needed to free the country from the pernicious pincer movement of the simultaneous cost-of-living and housing crises. This in time will restore greater control over public spending and remove the uncertainty about the country’s direction, thereby putting us in a better position in relation to the markets.This is Manchesterism and, yes, as one of our famous sons, Tony Wilson, once said – it does mean doing things very differently.Andy Burnham is the mayor of Greater Manchester.

Perhaps you were busy having a life in December and missed it. But this week’sexplosion by Brooklyn Beckhamwas the culmination of a chain of events triggered last month when Victoria Beckham, advisedly or otherwise, chucked alike at her son’s videoof a roast chicken on Instagram.For some, the takeaway was that Brooklyn’s chicken looked undercooked. For others, it was a reminder that you could draw a face on a balloon and achieve roughly the same level of sentience as Brooklyn in his cooking videos. All of which was to miss the point: that according to the new semiotics of family alienation, Brooklyn’s mother, by liking his post, had crossed a fraught boundary between “NC” (no contact) with her son to “VLC” (very low contact). Had Brooklyn not blocked her and the rest of the family immediately, she may have gone the whole hog and escalated to LC – “low contact” – at which point all bets would’ve been off.These terms derive from burgeoning online communities in which adult children estranged from their parents gather in groups for mutual support. This kind of alienation isn’t new; it probably goes back as far as the family unit itself. What’s unique to the era of gen Z and millennial kids cutting their gen X and boomer parents out of their lives is codification, an attempt to legitimise and name a traumatic experience in an effort to remove stigma and guilt from painful decisions.It’s a Brooklyn v Beckham Inc disaster: what happens when the elephant in the room goes rogue | Marina HydeRead moreIt is the weight of these decisions – the question of whether they are being increasingly flippantly, if not petulantly, made – that critics of the “no contact” movement call out. As you would expect in an era in which terms formerly used by psychiatrists are bandied about by all of us, parents in these groups stand accused by their estranged offspring of an entire medical textbook of damaging behaviours including narcissism, borderline personality disorder, controlling and “high-conflict” behaviours, and gaslighting. And while there aren’t many examples of families driven apart by a business model premised on parental oversharing – to take Brooklyn’s rationale at face value – the Beckhams are, in other ways, typical: the damage inflicted by attention-addicted control freaks is a very common theme.On the other side of the dispute are various shades of the culture-war position: suck it up, snowflakes, we all make mistakes. (David Beckham put it slightly more gracefully this week whenhe said, cryptically, that “children are allowed to make mistakes”.) Personally, I don’t know anyone who has taken the decision to walk away from their family lightly. I’m also aware of people whose parents are life-wreckingly damaging but can’t bring themselves to walk away. In data cited in Anna Russell’s excellentdeep diveon this subject in the New Yorker in 2024, 27% of Americans are said to be estranged from a relative, while in Britain, charitiesestimate that 20% of familiesare affected by estrangement. These numbers don’t seem to me either excessive or surprising.And there are half measures. These, too, have helpful handles with followings on TikTok. One is called “grey rocking”, the practice of staying in contact with toxic family members while not being drawn in by their provocations, instead simply nodding, smiling and going along with what is being said, while taking none of it in and remaining entirely emotionally uninvolved. (It strikes me that large numbers of men nail grey rocking without even realising it.)But back to the Beckhams. It is a measure of Brooklyn’s limitations that the method via which he chose to attack his parents for living on Instagram was a series of Instagram stories. Anyone seeking further insight into the Peltzes, meanwhile, might enjoy spending half an hour browsing thecounter lawsuitfiled by Brooklyn and Nicola’s wedding planners in response to the suit Nelson Peltz, Nicola’s father, brought against them. Put it this way: as personality types go, the Peltzes seem every bit as lovely – even more lovely, perhaps – as the Beckhams.Elsewhere, there are early indications that accused parents are fighting back.Doormat Momis a social media account set up by 59-year-old Laura Wellington after her daughterfailed to invite her to her weddingand which now has 140,000 followersacross various platforms. “Were you a really good parent who did the best they could and yet your child has decided to be an ungrateful little bastard as an adult?” says Wellington in the opening video. “We need to connect here. We need to support each other, and we need to talk about it.” Victoria and David: your support group awaits.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBrooklyn BeckhamOpinionDavid BeckhamVictoria BeckhamParents and parentingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

England is about to find outAditya ChakraborttyIt’s not just Tunbridge Wells – a country famous around the world for its rain is in danger of self-imposed droughtThu 22 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 07.36 ESTShareYou get up and go to the loo, only to find the flush doesn’t work. You try the shower, except nothing comes out. You want a glass of water, but on turning the tap there is not a drop. Your day stumbles on, stripped of its essentials: no washing hands, no cleaning up the baby, neither tea nor coffee, no easy way to do the dishes or the laundry. Dirt accumulates; tempers fray.The water company texts: we are so sorry; colleagues are working to restore connection; everything should soon be normal. You want to believe them, but the more it’s repeated, the more it becomes a kind of hold music. There’s no supply the next day, and the day after, and the day after that. Each morning brings with it the same chest-tightening question: what will happen today? Buckets and bottles don’t stop you feeling grubby and smelly, or from noticing the taint on your family and friends and neighbours. You’re not quite the people you thought you were and nothing feels normal.For some of you reading this, statistics suggest the above has already happened to you, and recently. For others, the modelling implies it could soon be your future.Last week,Tunbridge Wells went without running waterfor days on end, for the second time this winter. Over the course of this decade, the town has suffered a run of outages and on-off supply, or what South East Water is pleased to call “resilience issues”. The experiences above were shared by residents, including one woman who showed me some of the chats on her street’s WhatsApp group. Amid the neighbourly efforts to help one another, what jumps out is how quickly social norms break down.Schools and GP surgeries are forced to shut, children’s birthday parties are cancelled. The WhatsApp threads almost thrum with anxiety: a bottling station has opened in this car park, the main road to another is gridlocked with queues, while yet another has run out. That Tesco has been stripped bare of water. An elderly relative who can’t carry a heavy pack of bottles leaves it on his doorstep, only to find the next morning it has been stolen. Hardly anyone goes out, and the high street turns ghostly.One of the richest towns in one of the richest societies in human history shows the rest of us that even lavish private affluence cannot make up for the really important forms of public scarcity. Yet much of the coverage of Tunbridge Wells and East Grinstead last week treated their drought as a little local bad luck. That is how Britain’s establishment likes to treat its human-made disasters – anything from unemployment to knife crime – as sad news from peripheral places. But as Mike Martin, the MP for Tunbridge Wells, observes: “South EastWatermay be the worst of all the water companies, but Thames Water comes second – and it serves millions of people. Water shortages will be coming to other parts of England very soon.”They’ve already started. In 2018, the “beast from the east”meant 200,000 households got cut off.In 2023,parts of Surrey suffered an outage; in 2024, thousands of households in and around the town of Brixham in Devon had to boil their drinking water because a nasty parasite had got in through cracked pipes.The theme here is the lack of investment, no matter how disastrous the consequences. The main water treatment works in the capital is “on its last legs”, said the chair of the Independent Water Commission, Jon Cunliffe, last summer, while publishing hisreview for the governmentof the water industry. Just one major fault at the 60-year-old plant, operated by Thames Water, and “millions of Londoners [would be] without running water”, forcing mass evacuations and the army to go on standby,says the FT.Just how badly theprivatised water industry has trashed our waterwaysis well known. You can’t step in the same river twice, said Heraclitus, but he has been outbid by ecologists who advise that, you know what, you might not want to step in any river in England once.Much less covered is the prospect of parts of the country running out of water entirely, yet government officials and ministers accept it is looming, especially for London and along the east of England. Add some extra responsibility, by all means, to climate breakdown and the sprawl of housing, but 30-plus years of running the water industry for excessive returns has left us badly exposed.Keir Starmer dreams of AI superpower status, while our ever-distracted media offers hot-and-cold running updates on the Beckhams alongside 24/7 Trumpvision. Yet the UK is lurching into a future that, when you stop to think about it, is both more alarming and remarkable: a country famous around the world for its rain imposing on itself a drought.Here is where the massive hole in our politics opens up. The right gave us privatisation of the water industry. Margaret Thatcher promised it would bring investment and put the country’s assets in the hands of a nation of small shareholders. What it’s done is entrust our most important public goods to a bunch of hedge funds and private-equity sharks in other countries, who have siphoned off whatever returns they can get while putting barely anything back.The result is an industry almost sinking under its own debt, often hooked for life support on loans at extortionate rates of interest (true for both small firms such asSouth East Waterand agiant such as Thames Water). The children of Thatcher now pretend the key obstacle is a planning system that prizes bats and newts over critical infrastructure. The sad thing is they have won over government ministers, whose white paper on water this week was a pathetic attempt to rebrand our regulators, and nothing more.The left wants to take water off the vultures and back into public ownership, and on that it has both a strong argument and overwhelming support from voters. But that still leaves the question of how to find the billions. That is addressed in an important new book,Murky water: Challenging an unsustainable system.Written by a group of academics and researchers, it points out that our water system won’t get extra billions from zombie companies who specialise in financial engineering rather than real engineers. In the end, it will come from you and me through our water bills, just as Thames Water customers will pay extra for the super sewer for decades to come. But to make serious investment, the way we charge for water must change. Rather than the current system which, like the detested poll tax, takes too much from the poor and too little from the rich, the authors argue for more progressive bills that reflect the ability to pay.Neither Starmer nor Kemi Badenoch or Nigel Farage are going to adopt these suggestions, but then the big political questions have been ducked by the big political parties for decades. But Murky water is a great challenge to a Westminster that listens to voters complaining about how nothing works, and simply asks for more patience, while making sure nothing ever changes.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsWater industryOpinionWatercommentShareReuse this content"

This genre-defying drama about the black experience could now rule awards seasonFull list of nomineesSinners becomes first film in history to earn 16 Oscar nominationsThu 22 Jan 2026 12.45 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 15.19 ESTShareAgree with them or not, these Oscar nominations deliver a pert slap to the accepted assumptions of awards season. The industry had been expecting landslides for classy upmarket fare such asChloé Zhao’s Hamnet, Paul Thomas Anderson’sOne Battle After AnotherandGuillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein, and also for Josh Safdie’s delirious comedy Marty Supreme. And that’s what they got.But perhaps no one expected these titles to get quite as colossal a smackdown as they got from Ryan Coogler’svampire drama thriller Sinners: a violent, high-energy fantasia about racism, music and the black experience, which hassoared ahead with 16 nominations– the most for any film in 97 years of the Academy Awards. Whatever happens on the night itself, Ryan Coogler has made Oscar history.Despite the snubs to Paul Mescal (not nominated for playing Shakespeare), to the second half of the Wicked saga and to Chase Infiniti (ignored for her adored performance as Leonardo DiCaprio’s daughter in One Battle After Another), Sinners is now the big story of this Oscar season – perhaps its only story.During the annual backlash season, the contrarians have been unburdening themselves of their views that no, Hamlet wasn’t inspired by Shakespeare’s dead son Hamnet, and no, One Battle After Another doesn’t address the reality of Trumpism. Meanwhile, Sinners has been fighting andwinning a quite separate culture war, and bringing off a mighty achievement for a highly individual film, a freaky tale of supernatural evil that riffs shrewdly on the idea that the blues is a genre of music that is consumed by the enemies of its producers. In the words of a character played by Delroy Lindo, himself rightly nominated: “White folks like the blues just fine, just not the people who make it.” Sinners fans will be cheering on its subversion of placid awards-season verities.I admit that Sinners isn’t my favourite Coogler film – preferring his world-conquering afrofuturist superhero adventure Black Panther, his boxing drama Creed and his social realist essay Fruitvale Station. . But, yes, I should also concede that those were films in accepted genres and Sinners is arguably more structurally ambitious, in that it refuses these generic expectations and challenges what is admissible in what appears at first to be a realist drama. Sinners could yet rule this awards season and reward a formidable film-maker and his very stylish leading man:Michael B Jordan.View image in fullscreen‘A bacchanal of strangeness’ … Leonardo DiCaprio in One Battle After Another, which got 13 nominations.Photograph: APOtherwise, Anderson’s counterculture trip One Battle After Another comes in behind with 13 nominations, including best picture and director: a bacchanal of strangeness and a delirious 162-minute cadenza of pure, exuberant film-making technique – I predict that the directing nod is the one it may beat Coogler in. But who knows?Marty Supreme, Sentimental Value and Frankenstein are all behind with nine nominations: Marty, for me, is the movie touched with pure inspiration and Timothée Chalamet delivers the sugar rush of enjoyment. Sentimental Value is a good film, wonderfully acted by Renate Reinsve, though not as good as Joachim Trier’s previous film, The Worst Person in the World and perhaps straying a little too much into the (yes) sentimental movieland territory of George Clooney’s Jay Kelly. Frankenstein is a sumptuously crafted piece of tasteful filmic furniture, though for me lacking the electric spark of pure horror needed to bring it to life.Hamnet gets eight: that extravagant romantic fantasy adored by many, including me, and resented by others who feel they are being browbeaten by a mixture of emotional coercion and preening literary prestige. It’s a lovely film, andJessie Buckleyis still in pole position for best actress, though I feel that it may fade at the Oscars and clean up more at the Baftas.The best film of the year has four nominations: Kleber Mendonça Filho’s uproariously disturbing and yet somehow groovy Brazilian drama The Secret Agent – like Antonioni’s The Passenger rewritten by Elmore Leonard – with Wagner Moura getting a nomination for his performance as the scientist on the run from the authorities in 1970s Brazil. It’s a great film and it’s heartening to see it continue to find friends since its debut at Cannes.Explore more on these topicsOscars 2026SinnersMichael B JordanHamnetJessie BuckleyChloé ZhaoRyan CooglercommentShareReuse this content"

What are your tips for living life between adversities?Integrity411My mother’s ex-husband was a questionable man and after he picked me up from elementary school he used to take me to a go-go bar where ladies were dancing in their panties. I was a child, so I thought: how nice for them, I hate getting dressed too! They dance all day and then some nice people put money in their panties.The ladies would give me milk or Coca-Cola and give me a dollar, so I wanted to be a go-go dancer when I grew up. At that age I didn’t know there was anything wrong with me going there and I learned not to judge people so quickly. However, when my mother discovered why I was coming home late she kicked into fifth gear. She told the bar not to let me in and instead showed me art, opera, ballet – anything that was free – and changed my palate and perspective. In a way, all that brought me here. Art can get you through things. Cry as hard as you can or even laugh as hard as you can, and hold on to the joy.A Long Walk is my favourite song of yours, not least because I was blessed to have that same experience. Is it something you shared with a special someone or something you yearned for which has not yet come to pass?Soulisasolis33Oh my goodness. I’ve had many long walks with dogs, my mother, my mate, my friends, my child. To just take a walk and talk is one of my favourite things to do, or just to take a walk in silence. I’d recommend it to anybody.View image in fullscreenScott on stage at the 2025 Essence Festival of Culture in New Orleans, Louisiana.Photograph: Erika Goldring/Getty ImagesYour willingness to write and sing about a woman’s deep need for good sex of all flavours – emotional, playful, animal – has made me respect my own desires. Will you be as honest about sex as you age?PtayboviDon’t Play on the new album is akin to A Long Walk: have a good date, followed by a long walk, spark conversation; get to know somebody deeply. It’s a tutorial because it seems to me, via social media, that people are not having quality intimacy. So much of it is performative, so people are missing out on something truly enriching, when you connect with someone you care for. True love gives us the ability to speak up, sleep, maybe even fight off societal ills. I wouldn’t have known that at 18, but my mother has always been very open about sex. Making love and screwing are different things, and I’d like people to know the difference. I can’t imagine not singing about this, because I sing about the things living people do.Your music has been the soundtrack for Black women’s lives since the early 2000s. How does that make you feel and what is the main message you hope to leave for future generations?brownpotatoesI don’t really like boxes. I’m a Black woman, and both portions are as powerful, rooted and exciting, but I’m an artist and believe in telling stories about the human condition for all people. I’m not Nina Simone, though I respect that kind of work. I’d love people to read my lyrics and listen to the body of work from beginning to end. I’m still discovering who Jill Scott is, but like a good meal, it takes time. I also like some mystery. I love Sade, but I don’t know what she had for breakfast, what she wore last night or any of her business. I just love her music. As an artist, you have to have some kind of balance.I loved [Scott’s 2000 debut] Who is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Vol 1. Who is Raheem [in the song Exclusively]?hutchmeupRaheem is an amalgamation of someone cheating, but the incident in the store happened to me. In real life I wasn’t the woman telling the story, I was the woman behind the counter. A woman came in and I smelled my boyfriend on her: that’s how I discovered he was cheating. So in the song she smells him, looks up and goes: “Raheem, right?” You learn what to look out for and who to stay away from.What were the cultural and musical influences that inspiredTo Whom This May Concern?SlowlySurelyC11It was necessary to take a long break. I don’t think you can create art without having some living in between and there were reasons to make some major changes. I cut some people out of my life, some ideas … I was paying attention to social media and people have got angrier. There are a lot of reasons for that and a lot of what’s happening is unsettling, but I wanted to present a private or personal revolution. The song Pressha is about the pressure to look, sing or act a certain way. It’s partly from my own life experience, but also from noticing that people are choosing an aesthetic over character or consistency. That’s dooming our relationships because you’ve married a shell or you’ve had a child with a shell, when the things that really matter are underneath the skin.View image in fullscreenScott and Desmond Dube in The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency.Photograph: Album/AlamyWhy do we not have any more The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency TV programmes? You were great in the series.consumersrrippedoffThank you. I loved playing Mma Ramotswe and had a beautiful time with Anika Noni Rose [Grace Makutsi] and Lucian Msamati [JLB Matekoni]. Then our producer Sydney Pollack passed away, followed by our beloved director Anthony Minghella, so everything shifted. We lost our fearless leaders. Anthony auditioned me six times, then when he finally gave me the role he said he knew it was mine before he met me. I said: “You put me through hell!” But he grew me. I thought they were auditions but really they were classes. He’d say: “OK, now say that line but like you’ve got a cracked rib”, or like “you have an eyelash in your eye”. I was so annoyed! But he was schooling me all the time. I’d love to do more acting but it has to be something I really want to do and I like a director who will guide me, trust me and test me.View image in fullscreenWith DJ AG on Camden High Street, London, on 12 January 2026.Photograph: James Klug/RedfernsWhat made you agree to appearing with [viral street performer]DJ AG in Camdenand when did you first hear about what he’s been doing?DCasherThere’sa [Washington DC rapper] called Noochiewho has people come to his house and perform on his front porch. It’s enjoyed by millions of people. So when I saw DJ AG on social media, I thought it would be fun to do something like that and be with people on the street, for free. It was even more exciting that I’d expected. People surrounded the car and were hitting the windows. I’d forgotten about things like that so it kinda took me off balance, but they were so happy to see me, I was happy to see them and we had a good time.Experimental, sensual and political, D’Angelo radically redrew the boundaries of soul musicRead moreBefore you became a star you took a teacher training course.

There’s music in words, like onomatopoeia. So I’d read to them and try to inspire them. I would have been strict but for their benefit: that tough teacher that jumps on your back but you wanna impress so badly. My favourite teacher was Miss Fran Danish, who introduced me to the poet Nikki Giovanni, who wrote about people like me and the people in my neighbourhood.

But Beryl Cook saw something else in all the drizzle and grey of this damp old country: she saw joy.The thing is, joy doesn’t carry the same critical, conceptual heft in art circles as more serious subjects, so Cook has always been a bit brushed off by the art crowd. They saw her as postcards and posters for the unwashed, uncultured masses, not high art for the high-minded. But she didn’t care: she succeeded as a self-taught documenter of English life despite any disdain she might have encountered. And now, on what would have been her 100th birthday, her home town ofPlymouthis throwing her a big celebratory bash.Cook ran a guesthouse on the Hoe, the city’s historic waterfront district, and in the 1970s filled it to bursting with paintings. Her earlier works here are a little timid, uncertain and messy. But by 1974, Beryl is Beryl, assured and confident. All the hallmarks are there: drinking, dancing, dressing up, laughing. Her characters are all big and plump, their bosoms are bursting, their eyes are cartoonish dots, their noses are sausage-y blobs. They all look the same, their uniformity – each figure distinguished only by hairdo or outfit – gives them a sort of universality, an immediate recognisability.View image in fullscreenSailors and Seagulls by Beryl Cook.Photograph: John Cook/Beryl CookIn 1975, an antique-dealing friend offered to take some paintings off her hands to free up some space, and before she knew it she’d hit the big time: she got a show at PlymouthArtCentre that same year, then an even bigger one at Whitechapel Gallery in London a year later. Soon her work was on magazine covers. She started doing children’s books and even got an OBE.The appeal is so obvious. Cook makes life look fun. The famous stuff here is all the bawdy, boozy, knee-slapping and titillation. Revellers fall about while doing karaoke, giggling women tumble out of a pub on a hen-do, girls in miniskirts play pool or piss themselves laughing as a male stripper rips off his jockstrap. This is a world of pints and laughter and dancing; of pubs and gay bars and cabarets; of public spaces where private desires can be lived out.Things get even saucier. There are two hilarious images of whip-wielding dominatrixes. Then a wall of self-portraits finds Cook indulging her and her husband’s fantasies. They dance naked with their reading glasses on. She smokes in lingerie, twirls pom-poms dressed as a cheerleader.View image in fullscreenEarnest and emotional … The Back Bar of the Lockyer Tavern by Beryl Cook.Photograph: Beryl Cook/John CookAnd she’s funny too, really funny. An old couple eat chips in a bus shelter covered in graffiti that says “Nigel is a wanker” and “I shagged a froggy”. In the background of her painting of Plymouth Argyle FC scoring a goal, you can just about see a rival fan strangling an Argyle supporter in among the celebrations. It’s great, hilarious, ridiculous.There’s the basic everyday stuff, too: bingo halls, Dyno-Rod workers clearing a drain, cheeky sailors having a smoke, women shopping at the market, nurses pulling a gurney, and everyone’s smiling and smirking in every painting.The rest of the show looks at her inspirations (Bruegel and Rubens, apparently) and her experiments with sculpture (including some very snazzy painted loo seats). But the real surprise is how earnest and emotional some of the work here is. Cook paints her son and husband felting a shed roof, her granddaughter on the swing, her daughter-in-law bringing up mugs of tea, everyone smiling gently. It’s so full of actual, genuine love. And it happens over and over in intimate paintings of her family. It’s lovely without being saccharine and gross.View image in fullscreenOrdinary is extraordinary … Window Dresser 2 by Beryl Cook.Photograph: Beryl Cook/John CookAcross town,a companion exhibition at Karst galleryfeatures work by contemporary artists with some thematic or aesthetic link to Cook: the brilliant, satirical cartoons of Olivia Sterling; the hyper-precise celebrations of LGBTQ lives of Flo Brooks; the hypnotic rave minimalism of Rhys Coren. It’s great, clever, fun and more than worth the trip.Cook’s body-positive depictions of everyday England allowed people to see their lives – whether sailors or strippers, gay or straight – reflected in art. While every serious artist in the country was trying to document the bleakness of working-class English life, Cook was out there saying: “Cheer up, mate, have a pint!”Her whole point isn’t just that the ordinary can be extraordinary. It’s that the ordinaryisextraordinary; that life is amazing, full of laughter and joy and fun. Being alive is precious and fantastical – and we should spend every possible second celebrating it.Beryl Cook: Pride and Joyis at the Box, Plymouth until 31 May.Explore more on these topicsArt and designPlymouthArtPaintingExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

We round up the best of this oddly resilient subgenreByRyan GilbeyThu 22 Jan 2026 10.45 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 10.51 ESTShare20. Stork Day (2004)An Italian-Spanish remake of Groundhog Day, with a cynical nature presenter doomed to repeat the same 24 hours while reporting on a stork colony in the Canary Islands. The best thing about it is the Italian title: È già ieri (It’s Already Yesterday).19. The Incredible Shrinking Wknd (2019)It’s Groundhog Day. Again. Except now the repeated days lose an hour with each revolution, introducing a crucial flicker of urgency. A Spanish holiday becomes agonisingly protracted for Alba (Iria del Rio), who uses the loop in which she finds herself stuck to maximise her life, starting with ditching the boyfriend who was about to dumpher.18.Source Code(2011)View image in fullscreenRepeat chance … Jake Gyllenhaal in Source Code.Photograph: Optimum Releasing/Sportsphoto/AllstarInserted into the mind of a man who perished in a bomb blast on a train, Jake Gyllenhaal must relive repeatedly the eight minutes before the explosion until he discovers the bomber’s identity. Some nice in-jokes (Scott Bakula, star of the time-travel series Quantum Leap, has a voice cameo; a ringtone plays Chesney Hawkes’s The One and Only) can’t disguise the fact that suspense tends to suffer when the world can be endlessly rebooted.17.Looper(2012)One of the pitfalls of the time-loop movie as thriller rather than comedy is that exposition can easily overwhelm characterisation. That’s the case in Rian Johnson’s futuristic fantasy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis as two iterations of the same “looper” – that is, a hitman paid to kill and dispose of enemies sent back in time by a crime syndicate. Over-fussy explanatory narration gets in the way, but it’s fun to hear Mob boss Jeff Daniels critiquing the hero’s retro wardrobe. “The movies you’re dressing like are just copying other movies,” he tells him. “Do something new.” Is he talking to the film-makers?16. Before I Fall (2017)A high-school student joins in with viciously humiliating the class misfit at a Valentine’s Day party. Once her life resets after a car accident, though, she endures endless identical versions of that day – including a class on Sisyphus (who is also referenced in othertime-loop movies including Triangleand The Map of Tiny Perfect Things). There are the usual dawning frustrations typical of the time-loop format – “Grounded? I’m already grounded!” she rages, when faced with the go-to parental punishment – before she learns not to be a despicable bully after all. Aww.15.The Map of Tiny Perfect Things(2021)View image in fullscreenHigh on cuteness … Kyle Allen and Kathryn Newton in The Map of Tiny Perfect Things.Photograph: Dan Anderson/Amazon StudiosHappy-go-lucky teen Kyle Allen is already stuck in the same day when a young woman (Kathryn Newton) crosses his path for the first time. Turns out she shares his predicament, but has poignant reasons for never wanting it to end. Together they embark on a project to map out all the overlooked moments of beauty in their small town. High on cuteness, this YA-inflected comedy-drama piles on references to Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow, Doctor Who and Time Bandits (which also centres on a map), but never quite establishes its own identity.14. Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer (1984)The time loop forms only a minor initial part of this anime sequel, which departs inventively from the original manga on which it is based. It earns a place here nevertheless for unbridled imaginative delirium. A group of school friends, having twigged that their days are repeating, zoom off into space and discover that their city is being borne on the shell of a colossal turtle. Standard.13.Happy Death Day(2017)View image in fullscreenDeath by broken bong … Jessica Rothe in Happy Death Day.Photograph: Patti Perret/Universal/AllstarIn a nifty touch, the opening Universal logo glitches and restarts. We then follow a college party girl (Jessica Rothe) repeatedly reliving her birthday, which ends each time with her murder; methods include stabbing, bludgeoning, drowning and death by broken bong. Now it’s up to her to catch her own killer. Groundhog slay, in other words; that comedy gets a mention when Tree’s new beau, aBill Murraynut, expresses dismay that she hasn’t seen it. The 2019 sequel (Happy Death Day 2U) was a repetition too far.12. Mondays: See You ‘This’ Week! (2022)Splat! An unfortunate pigeon collides with the window of a high-rise Tokyo advertising agency – but when it keeps happening, the employees realise they’re stuck in a time loop. Exempt from this knowledge is their boss, whom they must convince (their PowerPoint presentation to him is a highlight) before the loop can be broken. Ryō Takebayashi’s workplace comedy sneaks a few jibes at corporate culture into its madcap format, and hinges on a poetic touch: the secret to escaping the loop turns out to lie within a beautiful unfinished manga.11.Palm Springs(2020)View image in fullscreenRelatable … Cristin Milioti and Andy Samberg in Palm Springs.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyLike The Map of Tiny Perfect Things, this adopts Groundhog Day writer Danny Rubin’s original, rejected idea of beginning the story with the time loop already under way. Andy Samberg is the carefree wedding guest stalked by crossbow-wielding JK Simmons, who is now sore for all eternity after being dragged into the loop with him. Amid the gory comic violence, there is a serious point: “What we do to other people matters … We have to deal with the things we do.” Dropping during the first Covid lockdown only made the film more relatable.View image in fullscreen‘The only hope was time’ … Davos Hanich in La Jetée.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Alamy10.La Jetée(1962)“The human race was doomed. Space was off limits. The only hope was time.” Chris Marker’s half-hour short comprises a series of still photographs and a single briefly moving image, as a dispassionate narrator explains how a post-apocalyptic time traveller is haunted by the childhood memory of seeing a man die at Orly airport. Spoiler alert: it was his own death he witnessed all along. Remade by Terry Gilliam as 12 Monkeys.9.Edge of Tomorrow(2014)Groundhog melee: the time loop hits the battlefield, with backroom boy Tom Cruise forced to become cannon fodder in a war against marauding alien beasties. He soon kicks the bucket, only to wake up again in the first of an endless series of loops, armed each time with fractionally greater knowledge of the enemy. It descends into homogeneous thrashing combat for the last half hour. Until then, it’s quite a ride, with Cruise happy to be repeatedly annihilated and to play second fiddle to co-star Emily Blunt in the action-hero stakes.8. 12:01PM (1990)Adapted from Richard A Lupoff’s short story, this Oscar-nominated short begins with a businessman (Kurtwood Smith) already reliving his lunch-break for the umpteenth time before the hour resets yet again. During several of these endless lunchtimes, he manages to reach a scientist who has made predictions about time loops. The prevalent note, though, is futility: the short ends, boldly and bleakly, with the marooned hero trapped for ever. Later expanded into the crummy 1993 TV movie 12:01.7.The Terminator(1984)A revolutionary leader fighting a future war against malign AI and its robot minions sends his father back in time to save his mother from a remorseless killing machine so that she can, in turn, get pregnant and give birth to him. That baby will then grow up to be a revolutionary leader fighting a future war against malign AI and its robot minions, and can send his father back to …woahhh.6.Céline and Julie Go Boating(1974)View image in fullscreenLoopy … Dominique Labourier and Juliet Berto in Céline and Julie Go Boating.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/AlamyJacques Rivette’s freewheeling Parisian fantasy is loopy in both senses. A pair of loose-goosey chums – one a magician (Juliet Berto), the other a librarian (Dominique Labourier) – run amok in Montmartre. They return repeatedly to a mansion where a sinister Jamesian melodrama revolving around the murder of a child is being re-enacted on a loop. By sucking on a magic sweet, the pals can first observe and then participate in the intrigue, taking the role of the child’s nurse and intervening to avert catastrophe: “We must save the kid at all costs!”5.Triangle(2009)Harassed single mother Melissa George takes a yachting trip with friends, only for a freak storm to hit, forcing them all to clamber on board a passing cruise liner where a serial killer appears to be the sole passenger. That’s the good news. The bad? Events are stuck in an endlessly repeating pattern that turns this into the world’s first maritime-loop movie. Unforgettable images depict the detritus from previous revolutions of the loop: piles of identical discarded sweetheart lockets, handwritten warnings from the past à laMemento, and, shockingly, multiples of the same corpse being pecked at by nonchalant seagulls.4. Je T’Aime, Je T’Aime (1968)View image in fullscreenAccessible, tender … Claude Rich in Je t’aime, Je t’aime.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyA shipping clerk who survives a suicide attempt agrees to take a trip through time: scientists will send him exactly one year into the past, courtesy of a time machine that resembles a giant pumpkin, and then bring him back after just one minute. The retrieval mission doesn’t go according to plan, however, and the woebegone soul bounces between fragments – some repeated, and none in chronological order – of the failed relationship that drove him to despair. Director Alain Resnais had already engaged in temporal jiggery-pokery withLast Year at Marienbadbut this is a more accessible and tender work, as well as a defining influence on Michel Gondry’s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Science of Sleep.3. Groundhog Day for a Black Man (2016)Director Cynthia Kao feeds four minutes of grimly comic social commentary into the Groundhog Day format. Like Bill Murray in that film, the protagonist here (played by Burl Moseley) is woken each morning by Sonny & Cher’s I Got You Babe. But, being Black, he finds each day truncated in the same fashion: no matter how placatory and unthreatening he is, he ends up shot dead by a white cop. The horror is expertly leavened with prop gags (a lobster costume, a lemon meringue pie) and the payoff is suitably sobering. The curiously similar 2020 Netflix short Two Distant Strangers went on to win an Oscar, and to attract accusations of plagiarism.2.The Clock(2010)A video installation on the theme of time, Christian Marclay’s clockwork masterwork is a rolling 24-hour collage of film clips in a literal loop, with no beginning and no end. Tied to whichever time zone it is being shown, The Clock also doubles as an actual timepiece: when the town hall clock on screen in Back to the Future shows 10:04pm, that’s the time in real life; and when Heather Langenkamp in A Nightmare on Elm Street sings “nine, 10, never sleep again”, there is no need to check your watch: it really is 9:10pm. The integrity is weakened by snatches of television clips (including ER and the Ricky Gervais sitcom Extras) but for the most part this is a hypnotic work of genius. Make sure you’re there at 6am for the megamix of fragments from Groundhog Day, What About Bob?, Good Morning Vietnam and Fright Night.1.Groundhog Day(1993)Never equalled … watch a trailer for Groundhog Day“That’s right, woodchuck-chuckers, it’s…Groundhog Day!” Wander through the history of the time-loop movie and you always end up looping back to Harold Ramis and Danny Rubin’s miraculous fusion of formalist experiment and mainstream high-jinks. Bill Murray is at his unsavoury best as the misanthropic weatherman who can’t wait for his jaunt to the Groundhog Day festivities in folksy Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to be over. He may be done with 2 February, however, but 2 February isn’t done with him. Precisely how long he is stuck in that day is never specified. “For me, it had to be … A hundred years,” said Rubin. “A lifetime.” But the script’s total absence of explanations is one of its most radical qualities. Hats off to the film-makers for resisting pressure to blame the time loop on a spurned lover’s curse or a black hole.Adored by everyone from David O Russell and Monty Python polymath Terry Jones to Turner prize-winning artist Gillian Wearing, Bridget Jones director Sharon Maguire and even Mad Max creator George Miller, Groundhog Day has spawned a stage musical, a VR game, an Italian remake and innumerable imitations. (The best is Natasha Lyonne’s ingenious series Russian Doll.) For all that, it has never been equalled – or, thank goodness, sequelled.The new edition ofGroundhog Day: BFI Film Classicsby Ryan Gilbey is published by BloomsburyExplore more on these topicsRankedDrama filmsAction and adventure filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsBill MurrayfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’ll be the first to take place without its founder, Robert Redford,who died last September at the age of 89, and it’ll be the last to take place in Utah, where it has been since the very beginning back in 1978.American independent cinema owes much to Sundance king Robert Redford | Adrian HortonRead moreEmotions, which are often on display regardless thanks to films often ruthlessly designed to elicit them, will be high, with events planned to commemorate a figure who helped create a launchpad and then an ecosystem for American indies. But while saying goodbye to both Redford and Park City will be front and centre, Sundance isn’t Sundance without a roster of films to also get attenders talking. Last year, it felt like that chatter was less effusive than usual because while there were films that continued evoking conversation throughout the year (Sorry, Baby, If I Had Legs I’d Kick You, Train Dreams, Lurker, Twinless, pretty much every documentary premiere) there were more that either died on arrival or crawled toward a slow death months later.Can this year wrap things up in Utah on a high?The GalleristView image in fullscreenNatalie Portman and Jenna Ortega in The Gallerist.Photograph: MRC II Distribution Company LPAfter deservedly winning an Oscar for her all-consuming downfall in Black Swan,Natalie Portmancontinued to take risks many others of her ilk were too scared to take. Some worked out (Jackie, Annihilation, May December, Vox Lux) and some didn’t (Lucy in the Sky, Jane Got a Gun, Song to Song), and Portman, in more conformist mode, managed to also get lost in the Marvel machine, gaining paycheques but losing our interest. After Portman called out the Golden Globes for its lack of female directors in 2018 and then wore a name-studded cape to the 2020 Oscars to bring attention to sexist snubs, she was criticised for having made only two films directed by women. She held her hands up and said she would try harder and since then, she has stuck to it, starring in the muddled Apple TV series Lady in the Lake for Alma Har’el, and this year she has two films made by women set for release. Before we see her enjoy Good Sex for Lena Dunham, she’s leading The Gallerist from Cathy Yan, a dark Art Basel Miami-set satire which sees her play a, yep, gallerist who gets involved in a scheme involving the use of a dead body as art. It’s always a thrill to see Portman in non-superhero territory, and the supporting cast – Jenna Ortega, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Zach Galifianakis, Sterling K Brown, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Daniel Brühl, Charli xcx – is the most tantalising of the festival.The MomentThe year ofCharli xcxcinema is kicking off quite spectacularly with a Sundance that will see her feature in three major films. There are two small roles in the art satire The Gallerist and erotic drama I Want Your Sex and then there’s The Moment, her big debut as lead, playing an exaggerated version of herself in an absurdist pop mockumentary. It’s the star’s riposte to the many self-indulgent concert docs we’ve witnessed in recent years, imagining what could have happened if she had made different choices during the Brat summer of 2024. It’s a fun and unusual move from someone at her level of fame but also a risky one given how difficult it can be to nail this particular brand of satire (the star has referenced This Is Spinal Tap as key inspiration, the sequel to which recently crashed and burned …) Hit or miss, it’ll be one of the hottest tickets of the festival.Knife: The Attempted Murder of Salman RushdieView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Eliza GriffithsWhile narrative films have been far harder to rely upon in recent years, Sundance has become a more trustworthy home for documentaries. This week saw all five Oscar nominees for the best documentary come out of last year’s festival, and this month’s crop promises more hot button issues and big-name celebrity tell-alls. There’ll be docs revolving around figures such as Billie Jean King and Brittney Griner, but the one that’s gaining the most heat is Alex Gibney’s intimate look at Salman Rushdie and the horrifying attack he survived in 2022. Knife: The Attempted Murder of Salman Rushdie, based on Rushdie’s similarly titled memoir, will feature video footage shot by his wife, the novelist and poet Rachel Eliza Griffiths, and is set to give viewers more insight into what happened that day and his recovery in the months after. In a recentinterviewwith the Hollywood Reporter, Rushdie has said the film is not the true crime story he imagined it would be but rather “a love story” instead.BuddyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Worry Well ProductionsIt’s pretty much a given that the festival will feature a major horror breakout, with hits such as Get Out, Saw, The Babadook, Talk to Me and Hereditary all receiving Park City premieres in recent years. It’s just not always easy to guess which film it’s going to be. The past two years have seen major sales for It’s What’s Inside and Together ($17m a piece), two scary movies that scared audiences away upon release. The most buzz right now would seem to be surrounding Buddy, a mysterious midnight movie from the company behind Barbarian and Weapons. Little is known about the plot other than it follows a young girl and her friends having to escape from an evil version of a classic kids TV show and that early promo hype has called it “a new experience in horror”, whatever that may ultimately mean. It stars The Penguin’s Cristin Milioti alongside Michael Shannon, Patton Oswalt and Keegan-Michael Key, an intriguing cast that, along with a writer-director with Adult Swim sitcom experience, suggests a horror with prominent comedic elements.The Friend’s HouseIs HereView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sundance InstituteThere may not be another film at this year’s Sundance that feels quite as timely as The Friend’s House Is Here, both for its content and the issues surrounding its premiere. It’s a secretly shot film about the importance of artistic freedom in Iran, made as bombing took place last summer and premiering as the Khamenei regime makes life for Iranians harder than ever with no access to internet and violence inflicted on those daring to protest. It’s also making its debut as Trump’s travel ban has meant that its two female leads and many crew members are unable to make it to the US. As Jafar Panahi’s politically tinged thriller It Was Just an Accident enjoys two major Oscar nominations even as the film-maker is facing a prison sentence in Iran, this drama, about two women in Tehran who must protect each other after their creative circle is exposed, couldn’t feel more relevant.The AI Doc: Or How I Became an ApocaloptimistView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Focus FeaturesIt’s about that time for an AI doc boom, given how much it’s infecting our day-to-day, and this year’s Sundance has the origins doc Ghost in the Machine and then the far more high-profile offering The AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist. It’s the new film from Navalny’s Daniel Roher, co-directing with Charlie Tyrell, and boasts the Oscar winner Daniel Kwan, of Everything Everywhere All at Once, as producer. The film, which is getting a big push by Focus Features, was born from Roher’s desire to understand the risks and opportunities attached to AI as he prepares to become a father. Pre-release materials promise “a stark wake-up call that explores the existential dangers and extraordinary promise of this rapidly rising technology”.The History of ConcreteView image in fullscreenPhotograph: John WilsonJohn Wilson’s short-running yet much-adored HBO series How To With John Wilson, which was both memoir and essay and saw him document the lives of New Yorkers while giving advice, was so hard to define that he made his own meta-trailer focused around that very fact. His first feature is based around a similarly unusual idea: What if he used the knowledge learned at a workshop aimed at helping people write and sell a Hallmark movie to try to sell a documentary about concrete? It’s hard to know exactly what to expect from that but promo materials highlight the word “strange” but also “joyful”, so expect the unexpected. With Wilson’s ardent fanbase and with Josh Safdie as producer, expect this to be one of the most in-demand tickets of the festival.The InviteView image in fullscreenPhotograph: The InviteAfter she premiered her beautifully made yet bafflingly written thriller Don’t Worry Darling at Venice, one might be a little cautious about getting too excited about another Olivia Wilde-directed film getting a high-profile festival premiere. But the actor-director, who is also leading Gregg Araki’s erotic drama I Want Your Sex at Sundance, has a follow-up intriguing enough to have us curious at the very least. While her ambitious 50s-set sci-fi might have ultimately buckled under the weight of its own incoherence, The Invite is keeping things simple. Based on the Spanish comedy The People Upstairs, it follows an unhappily married couple who are invited to take part in an orgy by their neighbours. Wilde stars alongside Seth Rogen,Penélope Cruzand Edward Norton (the original cast was set to include Amy Adams, Paul Rudd and Tessa Thompson), and while the small cast and limited locations might make it seem like a classic lo-fi Sundance chamber piece, Wilde has reportedly shot it on 35mm with a team of collaborators (Yorgos Lanthimos’s longtime editor, Blood Orange on music, The Last Black Man in San Francisco’s skilled cinematographer) that suggests it will be that much more.The WeightView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Matteo Cocco2025 was a hell of a year for Ethan Hawke, leading a box office hit in Black Phone 2, a critically acclaimed new TV series in The Lowdown and scoring his fifth Oscar nomination for his exceptional performance in Blue Moon. He’s kicking off the new year with a return to Sundance (he has previously premiered films including Before Sunrise, Boyhood and Juliet, Naked at the fest), teaming up withRussell Crowe, who scored a surprise hit with last year’s second world war drama Nuremberg (the film reached over $46m at the global box office, more than many of this year’s Oscar contenders). In The Weight, from the TV director and editor Padraic McKinley, Hawke will play a struggling father in the 1930s who must smuggle gold in order to escape a brutal work camp. Crowe will again take on villain duties.AntiheroineView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Edward LovelaceOne of the more intriguing star-led docs at the festival promises an unfiltered look atCourtney Love, a star who has long been incapable of operating with any sort of filter. Antiheroine follows her after her 2019 move to London as she focuses on maintaining her sobriety and recording a new album. The film features contributions from names such as Michael Stipe and Billie Joe Armstrong and has been described as “raw, complicated, and deeply human”. It comes from the same production team behind documentaries on other famous women such as Pamela Anderson and Victoria Beckham. While it’s healthy to remain a little sceptical of celebrity docs which have been made with the subject’s input, Love is not a star one can imagine holding back.Explore more on these topicsSundance 2026Sundance film festivalFestivalsNatalie PortmanCharli xcxSeth RogenJenna OrtegafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it’s nice to have a distraction from the daily horrors.)View image in fullscreenThe album art for Harry Styles’s Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally., out 6 March.Photograph: Columbia Records/PAAs for the first question, it’s true that the lines are not parallel. If Harry is speaking in the imperative, telling us to kiss constantly and also to sometimes go to the disco – using “disco” as a verb – then it would be consistent to leave out the comma. But that doesn’t necessarily mean Styles is doing anything wrong.“It’s not a perfect construction by our grammatical standards and that’s fun,” says Britt Edelen, AKA @poeticdweller, who wrote theviral postand is a PhD candidate in English at Duke. The result, intentional or not, is that “it adds some kineticism to what would otherwise be boring” and “fits into a larger scheme of people trying to articulate things via commas that aren’t actually how we use them”. He cites Virginia Woolf – known forlong, heavily punctuated sentences– as one example; more recently, the movie Die My Love leaves out a comma where we might expect one.I think Americans are overly punctilious punctuators. They tend to pay attention to rules and prohibitions a lotEllen JovinAlso, disco is not usually a verb. “When I see ‘disco, comma’, it’s giving me a little bit of a mental break,” says Ellen Jovin, author of several books on grammar and star of the road-trip docu-comedyRebel With a Clause, in which she traveled the country forging connections through conversations about sentence structure and punctuation. Edelen agrees: the comma, he says, was probably added to “render the time of speech graphically, as in: disco [pause] occasionally”.In the second sentence, Styles has “changed parts of speech. I’m now working with a noun, and then it’s kind of playful”, he says. The comma leads to “a different adverbial idea: not all the time, just occasionally”. And Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally. is surreal language to begin with – it’s unlikely you’d see the phrase come up in a research paper or international treaty. “People are trying to impose some sort of standard sentence punctuation on something that’s not that at all,” Jovin says.On top of that, the context matters: this is an album title, not high school English. Even if itwereEnglish class, you would see this sort of thing in a novel – “commas that you would say the same kind of thing about: ‘Wait, that’s not right. That doesn’t belong there,’” Jovin says. “This is just creativity, and I think it’s perfect.’”The visuals matter here too; maybe Styles just likes the way the comma looks, especially in a world where we see song and album titles more and more. Unlike physical media – or early MP3s, which gave users some control over metadata like song names – music-streaming apps proudly display the title of each song on our phones with the artist’s preferred styling and punctuation. Artists have played with this ability in recent years: on Billie Eilish’s 2017 EP dont smile at me, for instance, most of the song titles were lowercase, while they were in all caps on 2024’s HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. Dijon’s album Baby, from last year, includes tracks titled HIGHER! and (Freak It). In the last week of 2018, according to aQuartz analysis, eight of Spotify’s Top 200 songs were styled in all caps or all lowercase; the next year, “more than 30 songs in a typical week” contained “non-standard capitalization”. (Quartz theorizes that the trend is related to the informality of texting.)It’s worth remembering that grammar rules are fluid and change from stylebook to stylebook, which is why, for instance, the album and film titles in this article are not italicized or put in quotes (see “titles”). Unlike the perception we might develop in school, there is no Official Global Consortium of Correct English whose henchmen will break your knees over a comma splice. “I think Americans are overly punctilious punctuators. They tend to pay attention to rules and prohibitions a lot,” Jovin says.From Chalamet to Mescal: why are celebrity lookalike competitions everywhere?Read moreThat’s not to say that grammar never matters, of course. There are plenty of rules that stylebooks and experts do agree on, and what counts is clarity. Take theexample from the Guardian style guideabout the importance of a well-placed comma: there’s a difference between dedicating a book “to my parents, Martin Amis and JK Rowling” and “to my parents, Martin Amis, and JK Rowling”.When it comes to an album title, on the other hand, ambiguity may be exactly the goal.In a possible case ofnominative determinism, Stylesclearly demonstratedhis penchant for grammar at a 2015 show, adding an apostrophe and an E to a Philadelphia fan’s sign so it said “You’re so nice” rather than “your so nice” (he then wrote “thank you – love, Harry” and gave it back, in case there was any doubt about the sign’s message). If Styles is a grammar nerd, the controversial comma was probably meant to be.Explore more on these topicsHarry StylesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She is exactly what the show needs right nowStuart HeritageThu 22 Jan 2026 07.28 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 07.30 ESTShareWhenPrue Leithannounced that she was leaving The Great British Bake Off, on the basis that “I’m 86 for goodness sake,” there was really only one figure who could realistically replace her. And so it has come to pass. Believe press rumours and the next Bake Off judge isNigella Lawson.If it’s true, this is the best possible call for a series that – if we’re honest – has lost its way. Bake Off has become slightly long in the tooth over the last half decade or so. This is partly to do with talent churn (over the years we’ve lost Mel and Sue, Mary Berry, Sandi Toksvig, Matt Lucas and now Prue Leith) and partly because the series is struggling to keep its challenges fresh.If it repeats the safe old formula that made it popular in the first place, it risks becoming stale. If it keeps ramping up the difficulty, then it risks alienating the home baker with bewildering levels of conceptual avant-garde science. If it tries doing national weeks again, as it did when it dressed everyone in sombreros and shook maracas during its ill-advisedMexican week in 2022, then its viewership will die of second-hand embarrassment.View image in fullscreenExiting … former GBBO judge Prue Leith alongside Paul Hollywood.Photograph: Channel 4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PAWhatThe Great British Bake Offreally needs now is a combination of talents that is very hard to come by. A new judge needs to have true expertise grounded in decades of experience. They also need to have forensic intelligence and enough full-beam charisma to paper over the cracks in the format.There are some figures who can achieve some of this.TV chef Lorraine Pascalewould be great but, judging by her Instagram, now primarily works in the skincare industry. Chef and author Ravneet Gill has a level of pastry expertise that would rival Paul Hollywood, but doesn’t have the right level of name recognition. There is also the possibility, since the show has been going long enough, that Bake Off could have cast one of its own alumni as a judge, perhaps by hiring the show’s first winnerEdd Kimberor its sixth, Nadiya Hussain. The problem with this, however, is that they aren’t Nigella Lawson.View image in fullscreenContender? Previous Bake Off winner, writer and TV presenter Nadiya Hussain.Photograph: Cliff Evans/BBC/Wall to Wall MediaNigella has been at the forefront of home cookery for almost 30 years, sinceHow to Eat was published in 1998. She’s been the face of it since one year later, when Nigella Bites debuted on Channel 4. With every subsequent release she has only consolidated her position. Now in her mid-60s, she has become exactly what the series needs right now. She is spectacularly British, and manages to balance the sort of familiarity that will reassure existing viewers with a level of international first-name recognition that might even end up growing the audience.Nigella Lawson: ‘I can be ecstatically happy with just bread and cheese’Read moreThe only time I have seenNigella Lawsonat work in the flesh was during a press day for the short-lived Channel 4 cookery contest series The Taste over a decade ago. And while her co-judges Ludo Lefebvre and Anthony Bourdain were forceful and garrulous respectively, Nigella managed to be both at once. Initially so haughty that even the thought of making eye contact with her terrified the life out of me, she then flicked on the charm so devastatingly that I turned into a puddle. I have photographic evidence, which bears the sweat patches to prove it.This is exactly the combination Bake Off requires. While Paul Hollywood typically gets pegged as the tough judge, the truth is that Mary Berry and Prue Leith both had a steely, imperious core that was just as immovable. They were lovely, of course, but go and pause any old episode and you’ll see flinty looks in their eyes. They both demanded that you impress them. Nigella is the same. She is formidably intelligent with high expectations. Imagine serving her a collapsed soufflé. Imagine the hurt and disappointment in her eyes.In truth, The Great British Bake Off is much closer to its end than its beginning. Like fellow warhorses MasterChef and The Apprentice, it has started to lumber on exhaustedly in recent years, and will soon be destined for the knacker’s yard. But if it’s going to go out, it deserves to go out as strongly as possible. Nigella Lawson is the only woman for the job.Explore more on these topicsThe Great British Bake OffTelevisionFood TVNigella LawsonFoodReality TVPrue LeithfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How The Traitors lost its soulIt used to be a breath of fresh air – TV’s most relatable reality show. Now it features shouting matches and bad-tempered confrontations, and the biggest loser is the viewerAlexi DugginsThu 22 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 11.00 ESTShareFor the past year,The Traitorshas had a massive problem. No, not the parade of indistinguishable white male contestants. Nor the way it increasingly kills off its most likable characters too early (RIP Jessie). Not even the fact that the disproportionate number of people of colour who leave the show early suggests it has a big problem with unconscious bias. Actually, sorry: let me rephrase. The Traitors has two massive problems.But here’s the one that defines this series: what the point of the show actually is. The celebrity version blew the previous regular season of The Traitors out of the water. It was absolutely charming, featuring a bunch of lovely people playing a gripping game while committing the politest series of murders possible. It smashed the normal version in every sense: ratings, watchability, how instantly it hooked you. And it was always going to be that way, given that this is a show that functions best when you’re rooting for as many contestants as possible. So when nearly every player is one you’re already familiar with, it inevitably makes for more gripping TV than a series where you spend the first two weeks going: “Sorry, there’s a guy in there called Jack?”But the runaway success of The Celebrity Traitors has risked the standard version looking as if its USP is: “The dull one.” The show’s producers have decided to deal with that problem by amping up the drama. Before its launch,Claudia Winklemancalled its new direction “hardcore” and “brutal”, adding that: “We get some very juicy round tables … It gets very heated ... it gets ugly.” She’s certainly not wrong. Some of this year’s contestants seem incapable of having their name mentioned at the round table without blowing their stack. James is often tetchy. Jade is on a constant hair trigger. By the end of Friday’s show, there was such bad blood that she even refused Matty’s offer of a hug, and he had to come back to try again the following episode.View image in fullscreenHead to head … Harriet takes on Rachel.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryThere has also been open warfare in the castle for the first time, with Fiona explosively going head-to-head with Rachel in a way that seemed genuinely ill-tempered. Even Harriet’s strategic attempt to take Rachel out devolved into such an unpleasantly aggressive breakfast shouting match that she has since told the Times: “It was awful watching it, I lost my temper and it’s not nice to see that … It was so intense, the pressure just got to me. That was insane behaviour. I’d never normally shout at someone I only met two weeks ago over breakfast.”It is, frankly, a massive shame. When it was first broadcast, The Traitors was a breath of fresh air. It felt like a revolution in reality TV, not because it had a penchant for the dramatic, but because it was populated by hugely relatable people navigating reality TV dynamics in an extremely nice way. So endearingly understated were the first couple of seasons, that sometimes people got kicked out of the game because they admitted to playing the game. It was the most British reality show imaginable.View image in fullscreen‘On a constant hair trigger’ … Jade in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryIn its first season, The Traitors was hailed as channelling the joy of the first season of Big Brother – where a bunch of ordinary people captivated the nation by being low-key daffy. Whose most iconic moment involved the entire cast (and viewing public) uniting in their apocalyptic hatred of calculated gameplay – and vilifying a man called Nick for writing some names on a bit of paper. It was a comparison that felt very apt – like BB, the early outings of The Traitors charmed a broad audience, many of whom wouldn’t normally go near the histrionics and confrontation of a typical reality show.In 2026, however, ruthless rules The Traitors. Winning the show has increasingly morphed into an exercise in who can be the most cut-throat. And that person, without question, is Rachel. She effortlessly batted away both Fiona and Harriet’s ferocious attacks. The way she blindsided Ross with: “Was Hugo this dramatic in the turret?” at the round table was one of the most astonishingly brazen bits of gameplay the show has ever produced. She will seemingly stop at nothing to win – and it’s working. Barring, of course, any last-minute dramatics from Faraazatha Christie.View image in fullscreen‘Read a copy of American Psycho as a training manual’ … Paul Gorton in The Traitors series two.Photograph: Studio Lambert/BBCThere have been cut-throat players before, of course – season two’s Paul Gorton even read a copy of American Psycho as a training manual. He didn’t, however, manage to match his arrogance levels to his ability to not get booted out,and proved an unwitting comic delight. Series one’s Wilf certainly had no compunction in stabbing his fellow traitors in the back. But his tendency to break down in tears when sticking the knife in – not to mentionbeing gloriously undone by Kieran’s parting shot– kept him the right side of likable. And while there’s been one other proper watch-through-fingers moment of brutality –Harry’s betrayal of Mollie in season two’s finale– that, at least, came in the show’s dying seconds.To watch The Traitors now, though, is no longer to immerse yourself in the friendliness that characterised previous seasons. Instead, it’s to plunge yourself into an energy that feels much more predictably reality TV, with its histrionics and manufactured drama. Where, for the first time, truly unpleasant moments have flared up. It is, of course, still very watchable television, but given the state of the world right now, do we really want to see the UK’s most lovely bit of reality escapism morph into something much harder and more aggressive? No thanks. In attempting to become a more brutal version of itself, it’s hard not to suspect that The Traitors has lost something: a bit of its soul.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe TraitorsReality TVClaudia WinklemanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As well as alumni from the 1995 album – Portishead’s Beth Gibbons and Blur’s Damon Albarn and Graham Coxon – and legends such as Pulp, Beck and Depeche Mode, there are a host of successful younger musicians including Olivia Rodrigo, Fontaines DC, Cameron Winter, Wet Leg and Sampha.Oscar-nominated film-makerJonathan Glazeralso contributed to the project, working with children in war zones across Ukraine, Gaza, Yemen and Sudan to create their own films, and recruiting children in the UK to document the making of the project.Arctic Monkeys, whose debut album turns 20 this week, said in a statement: “We are proud to support the invaluable work War Child do and hope the record will make a positive difference to the lives of children affected by war.”James Ford, who has produced or co-produced all but one of the Arctic Monkeys’ albums, oversaw the album which was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in November.“The original Help meant a lot to me and to have the opportunity, given the current news cycle, to help galvanise our music community into doing something as unarguably positive as helping children in war zones seemed like a no-brainer,” he said. “The experience of making the album itself has been very powerful, and dare I say life-affirming.”War Child estimates that the number of children affected globally by war has jumped from one in 10 when the 1995 compilation was released, to one in five today, around 520 million children.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockArctic MonkeysJonathan GlazernewsShareReuse this content"

Create, clone or copy my voice! … We used AI arrangements. Not AI vocals … The shout outs are all mine!”In an accompanying press release, she said: “I’ve always believed that music is about connection and emotional truth. What interested me here was the idea of using my voice and new tools in service of expression, not instead of it. This project respects the artist’s voice, the artist’s choices, and the artist’s ownership. I grew up watching my parents create wonderful dreams that were owned by other people. ElevenLabs makes it possible for anyone to be a creator and owner. That matters.”The track is part of a compilation of other music created or modified by AI, andArt Garfunkelis among the other artists featured. His track Authorship features a spoken excerpt from his memoir What Is It All But Luminous, paying tribute to his father over an AI piano backing.“Music has always evolved alongside technology, from microphones to multitrack recording,” Garfunkel said. “What impressed me about this experience was the respect for musicianship. The human remains at the centre. My voice plus the technology simply opens another door.”The pair’s enthusiastic uptake of AI is in marked contrast to others in the industry: there are fears that AI-generated music will undermine the employment of human musicians, and imitate the work of others without properly compensating them.Ed Sheeran has said: “If you’re taking a job away from a human being, I think that’s probably a bad thing. The whole point of society is we all do jobs. If everything is done by robots, everybody’s gonna be out of work. I just find AI a bit weird.”And Lil Wayne has doubted that AI could accurately replicate his own voice: “I am naturally, organically amazing. I’m one of a kind. So actually, I would love to see that thing try to duplicate this motherfucker.”A wave of new “generative AI” companies such as Udio, Suno and Klay are nonetheless forging ahead,striking deals with record labelsto allow users to manipulate artists’ work with AI tools, or create entirely new tracks using text prompts, based on the AI absorbing the work of others and using it to inform new compositions. The artists can choose whether to opt into these services.Record labels were initially hostile to the companies, threatening legal action, but there have since been a number of settlements and partnerships.After settling with Universal and Warner, Udio announced this week that it was partnering with Merlin, an umbrella organisation representing indie labels such as Beggars Group, Epitaph, Domino, Sub Pop and Warp – meaning that artists from Arctic Monkeys to Aphex Twin could make their music available to Udio’s AI tools.Speaking to the Guardian this week, Suno founder Mikey Shulman said the use of AI in music was already very widespread. “It was described to me that we’re the Ozempic of the music industry – everybody is on it and nobody wants to talk about it,” he said.Explore more on these topicsLiza MinnelliPop and rockAI (artificial intelligence)Art GarfunkelnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the latest in a string of reading-focused government initiatives, the flagship being the education department’s National Year of Reading 2026, which kicked off last week with an event at the Emirates Stadium in London.The Year of Reading campaign comes on the back ofresearch by the National Literacy Trust(NLT), which found reading enjoyment among children and young people is at its lowest recorded level, with just one in three of those aged eight to 18 now reporting enjoying reading “very much” or “quite a lot”.The year-long campaign aims to work with schools, communities, libraries and early years settings to boost reading for pleasure and, in doing so, “give kids the best start in life”.Other plans are in the works too. In September,Rachel Reeves pledgedthat every state primary school in England will have a library by the end of this parliament. In late November,an inquiryinto reading for pleasure was launched. Non-government schemes are also under way, with theChildren’s Booker prizelaunched in October.View image in fullscreenThe education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, talks with pupils at Welland Academy, Peterborough.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA“It’s about making reading seem as natural and everyday as breathing,” says Noughts & Crosses author and former children’s laureate Malorie Blackman, who is among a star-studded list of ambassadors for the Year of Reading campaign. “Reading is so important for understanding the world around you. It’s very easy to become laser-focused on just your own experiences, but reading gives you a way of expanding your horizons, learning about other people and other ways of thinking and feeling and doing. We’re in danger of losing that ability to connect and communicate.”As a child, it was access to a local library that first sparked Blackman’s love of reading. “I used to live in my local library. I didn’t actually go into a bookshop until I was 14, because I couldn’t afford the books,” she says. “Having a public library within walking distance, and the revelation that I could read any and all of the books, made me who I am.”This is the third National Year of Reading campaign, after earlier iterations in 1998 and 2008. But as the first in the era of widespread smartphone use and streaming, the campaign will focus on all forms of reading material – something Blackman is passionate about.“I think reading has got a reputation for being this overly worthy, solitary activity, and it so isn’t,” she says. “There are so many types of reading you can do. There’s nothing wrong with, for example, reading graphic novels or comic books. If you’re into cars or motorbikes or whatever it might be – whatever hobby or pastime – you can get more out of it if you read about it.”View image in fullscreen‘I used to live in my local library’ … Malorie Blackman signs a book for a young fan at the Hay festival during her time as children’s laureate.Photograph: Steven May/AlamyReading “doesn’t seem to offer the immediate social rewards that motivate us today,” says Jonathan Douglas, chief executive of the NLT, which is helping the government deliver the campaign. “It’s seen as slow, solitary, and studious in a world that values speed, status and spectacle.”The DfE is encouraging parents to “lead by example” when it comes to reading habits, and to read with their children. “Shared reading in the very early years is the most impactful way to build a lifelong love for reading,” says Julie Hayward, director of partnerships for BookTrust, one of the campaign partners. Reading with children under six also helps with self-regulation, empathy and bonding.Hayward acknowledges that access to reading is not a level playing field. Barriers parents might face in reading with their children include having had a “negative kind of educational journey” or “low confidence in their own literacy levels”.The campaign approach is key, adds Hayward. “We shouldn’t be judgmental or preachy. It should be fun and joyful.” The 2026 campaign “focuses on appeal, not duty, and highlights the immediate rewards of reading, making it feel relevant, exciting and rewarding right now, not just in the future,” says Douglas.While the focus on enjoyment makes intuitive sense, studies on childhood reading suggest it could be overly narrow.Research by Sabine Little, a senior language education lecturer at the University of Sheffield, found that multilingual children spend more time reading for pleasure than monolingual children, and read a wider variety of texts and formats.Multilingual children typically think about the importance of reading in a broader range of ways, explains Little. When she asked multilingual children she worked with to list three things they had read that were important to them, there were “very, very few” books that were included “because of the plot or because they were favourites. It was much more to do with the connections that the books facilitated” – for example, “the first book read in a new country, the book that introduced them to a new hobby”.The Guardian view on the National Year of Reading 2026: time to start a healthy habit for life | EditorialRead moreOne child cited racehorse listings in Hungarian, because he read those with his grandmother when he was visiting Hungary. Little believes we can learn from the way multilingual children forge connections to books and apply this with monolingual children too. Validating reading material that holds importance to them in different ways would help create a better culture around reading.For Hayward, the newly launched Children’s Booker prize is a huge step forward. The first winner will be announced in early 2027, with £50,000 awarded for the best fiction for readers aged eight to 12, decided by a mixed panel of adult and child judges. The Booker prize foundation will also give 30,000 copies of shortlisted and winning books to children each year.While more attention for children’s books is always positive, Steven Pryse, who co-owns the independent children’s bookshop Pickled Pepper Books in north London, is sceptical about the prize’s impact. “The children’s book award scene is crowded, and I’m not convinced the Children’s Booker will make much of a difference.”There is “a fear as well that the prize might pick up on literary books rather than stuff that is more accessible, which, for me, might be a bit of a danger, with things becoming a little hierarchical.”However, Little says the prize will create a good opportunity for children to discuss reading in the way they discuss games, television and social media. “One of the things children enjoy doing is speaking about books to their peers.” She is “super excited” that the new prize will include books in translation and has the potential to show that books from different cultures and originally written in languages other than English are a valuable part of British children’s literature.“It’s important for the authors and the publishing houses, but it’s especially important for children”, explains Hayward, “to have great books that are really exciting and engaging, that they can see themselves in.” Ultimately, the Children’s Booker and the Year of Reading have the same aim: encouraging children to discover books they’ll enjoy. “Whatever you’re into, there are books out there for you,” says Blackman. “When people say to me that they don’t like reading, I always say to them: you just haven’t found the right book yet.”5 tips to get children readingMake it fun“We’re surrounded by words and stories all the time – read the adverts on the bus or on billboards together,” says Pryse. “Reading doesn’t have to always mean a book – try reading a recipe together, or making up a story based on your shopping list.”Create a relaxed environmentLittle encourages parents not to panic if there is a period when their child isn’t reading as much, adding that the more you push children, the more you create a pressurised environment around reading.Share stories early“Share stories in the early years, so when children get into school, it doesn’t all become about homework,” says Hayward.Read yourself“Let your kids see you reading, even if it’s a magazine or newspaper,” says Pryse. “Why not revisit some classics from your own childhood and share them with them.”Let them read what they want“Let children gravitate to the books that capture their interest, even if they seem ‘lightweight’,” says Sarah Satha, who co-founded Inclusive Books for Children (IBC). “Supplement these with award shortlists – Carnegie, Booker, The Week Junior or IBC awards – and don’t be afraid to experiment with genres, formats, and reading levels until you find what hooks them in.”Explore more on these topicsBooksChildren and teenagersLiteracyLibrariesChildren's Booker prizefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is like a marriage’Sian CainThu 22 Jan 2026 01.04 ESTLast modified on Thu 22 Jan 2026 05.32 ESTShareTenacious D member Kyle Gass has confirmed that he and bandmate Jack Black have reconciled and will reunite, after outrage over an onstage joke about the assassination attempt on the US president,Donald Trump, led to the band going on hiatus.While performing in Sydney in July 2024, when Black suggested he make a wish for his birthday while blowing candles on stage,Gass responded, “Don’t miss Trump next time”, referring to the assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania earlier that week.Tenacious D’s Trump shocker upends a career of perfectly judged musical comedyRead moreThe resulting furore, which saw media outlets all over the world cover the comments and Australian senator Ralph Babet demand that the band be deported, ended with Gass and Black cancelling their entire Australian tour andannouncing “all future creative plans” were on hold.But in a new interview with Rolling Stone, Gass said he and Black have “hashed it out”.“We hashed it out. And it was hard. It is like a marriage. You go through these ups and downs, and try to understand your partner,” Gass said. “We will serve no D-wine, before it’s D-time – but we will be back. We will return.”Gass said the joke was the result of “terrible judgment”.“I’ve felt terrible ever since, because it’s such a responsibility to not screw up like that,” he said. “I was naïve, of course – people are gonna pick that up. But I just felt it was kind of a private moment. I thought I was safe in the bubble. And it was so fast.”“If there was ever a ‘too soon,’ it was this,” he added. “And maybe I thought I was on it, or ahead of the curve. But no, it was definitely too soon.”He described the “overwhelming” reaction as “a tsunami of shit rolling over you” and said his 95-year-old mother was targeted afterwards.“Somebody called my mom. My poor 95-year-old mom. It hits close to home, and you want to be brave and courageous, but I’m not a congressman. We’re just entertainers. And it just bespeaks the insanity of the times. It feels almost vindictive,” he said.In the aftermath, it appeared Gass and Black were at odds in their response. In a statement on social media amid the furore, Black wrote: “I was blindsided by what was said at the show on Sunday. I would never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form.”Gass also apologised after, writing: “The line I improvised onstage Sunday night in Sydney was highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake. I don’t condone violence of any kind, in any form, against anyone. What happened was a tragedy, and I’m incredibly sorry for my severe lack of judgment. I profoundly apologize to those I’ve let down and truly regret any pain I’ve caused.”Gass deleted the apology days later, leading some fans to speculate he had wanted to take it back. But Gass told Rolling Stone that he hadn’t recanted the apology, saying: “If I would have recanted, I would have said that.”He said Black and he “were in our own camps” dealing with the fallout at the time, and denied Black’s apology had caused any problems for him, adding: “I might have deserved it. Or, he had to protect himself from his loose-cannon partner over here. I totally understood once safety concerns got in.”Black has also assured fans the band would return some day,saying in August 2024: “We had to take a break … Everybody takes a break sometimes.”Explore more on these topicsMusicJack BlackDonald Trump Pennsylvania rally shootingDonald TrumpPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

I’m afraid that this former (British) Vogue intern did not pass muster: wrong era, wrong country.A woman who almost certainly would pass with flying colours is the former Vogue staffer Caroline Palmer, now the author of a novel, Workhorse, set at “the magazine” during the dying days of a golden age of women’s glossies, when the lunches were boozy, the couture was free and almost anything could be expensed. In this first decade of the new millennium, we meet Clodagh, or Clo, a suburban twentysomething “workhorse” trying to make it in a world of rich, beautiful, well-connected “show horses”, and willing to do almost anything to get there.The women’s magazine has an established literary history, from The Bell Jar to The Devil Wears Prada. So too does the genre we’ll call “young woman comes of age in New York City” – I’m thinking of books such as The Girls’ Guide to Hunting and Fishing, Rules of Civility and My Salinger Year. Then there’s the grifter narrative (The Talented Mr Ripley,Emma Cline’s The Guest, Gatsby, even Breakfast at Tiffany’s). The grifter isn’t solely an American phenomenon, but it makes the most sense there; a new country without an aristocracy, where reinvention always feels possible. Workhorse is a novel that ticks so many boxes it’s unsurprising that it provoked a bidding war. It even has that most fashionable of protagonists: a highly dislikable heroine.Workhorse is a novel that ticks so many boxes it’s unsurprising that it provoked a bidding warClo is a liar, a thief and an alcoholic who brims with class envy and internalised misogyny. The way she describes other women is often vile, though sometimes hilarious: “she looks particularly haggard tonight in the harsh kitchen lighting, like when you spot a famous actress buying bananas at a Midtown bodega”. It feels fitting for a character who finds herself in a working environment where people say things such as “there is nothing more disgusting than seeing a woman eat the appetisers at a cocktail party”. Despite Clo’s unpleasantness, as is the way with these novels, you cannot help but root for her – initially, at least. Workhorse follows her from her days as an underling to an Upper East Side apartment and a job as an editor. Watching her get there is, at times, tremendous fun. Palmer has a talent for wit, and Clo’s observations on the foibles of the fashion industry are razor-sharp. Her dark obsession with the beautiful, well-bred Davis Lawrence, a colleague at the magazine and the daughter of one of the most awful mothers I have ever encountered in fiction, is well drawn, as is her friend Harry, the real Holly Golightly of the story. Here are two people who ooze charisma, where the seething, grasping, increasingly desperate Clo has none.That, ultimately, is the novel’s problem. It’s not that young women don’t deserve to be the subject of Goldfinch-length epics, and I have no childish aversion to unlikable characters. I did, though, perhaps wish I didn’t have to spend so much time with Clo. Workhorse comes in at more than 500 pages, which is a long time to be in anyone’s head. Perhaps it is an issue of the first person, and a close third person would have worked better. Regardless, you could have cut a full third of this novel and I don’t think it would have suffered for it. If anything, that would have allowed some of Palmer’s truly brilliant writing – such as her gorgeous description of a New York power cut – to further stand out.That the fashion industry can be shallow and ruthless is news to no one. The Devil Wears Prada was published 22 years ago, and we are now in a post-Wintour era. It’s hard to know how interested the general reader will be in another nostalgic swansong for the heyday of magazine publishing. I enjoyed a glimpse at the glamour immensely, though it’s always, in a sensation familiar to all journalists, tinged with the feeling that you got into the game just as the party at Bungalow 8 was ending. What elevates Workhorse beyond its central theme is a more profound exploration of the emotional burden carried by the perpetual outsider; what a weight – and a waste – such an envy and ambition entails, how one day you turn around and find that you have “burn[ed] through an entire decade in a single night”. As one of the characters says: “you grow up with all these questions you really want answered … Am I going to get married? Or will I have kids or a good job or whatever, and then when you start to get the answers, it feels sad?”Workhorse by Caroline Palmer is published by 4th Estate (£16.99).

While on one hand, audiences may feel that there’s only so much Trumpian lunacy they can take, it also means that newcomer Leigh Douglas’s satirical one-woman show – which had a sold-out run at the Edinburgh fringe last year – couldn’t feel more timely.The Irish-born, American-raised comic plays Chastity Quirke, a sorority girl turned White House receptionist working for president Ronald Drumpf, whose administration is highly sexist (and other “ists” besides). She begins the show with a fervour for conservatism and a love of Maga-style beauty standards, requesting that the audience scream if they believe in “[making] America hot again”, and gyrating suggestively whenever she gets the chance.Chastity isn’t, she insists, merely here to be “window dressing for the Drumpf administration”, and sees herself as a crucial part of his operation. But a disembodied narrator – also in Chastity’s voice – hints at trouble to come. Drumpf, we learn, plans to unlawfully stay in office past two terms. Chastity is privy to his plot, but will she do as she is told and quietly burn the incriminating documents that her boss has secreted in a Whole Foods carrier bag?‘It feels so taboo’: Natalie Palamides on playing both halves of a toxic couple and her shocking next showRead moreDouglas is a seriously funny performer who plays not just Chastity but an array of side characters in this 70-minute show, ably directed by Fiona Kingwill. For Drumpf’s men, she leans into bad posture and lecherous gazes, while the women are largely sprightly and coquettish, and the sparse set never feels too limited to bend to each new personage.While great fun at first, however, it slowly runs out of juice. As we teeter unevenly towards the end of the show, the gags become less biting and the lines more broad, among them a take on the oft-quoted poem First They Came by Martin Niemöller, about apathy in the face of nazism (“First they came for the immigrant families”, laments Chastity, “and I said nothing, ’cause I wanted the boys to like me”).The show ends tensely and abruptly, blunting its spikier moments of satire. Still, there is much to appreciate here, and Douglas and Kingwill have nailed what makes Maga women tick: not just a yearning to be pretty, but a lust for power too.AtPark theatre, London, until 7 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)US politicsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The hum of a packed, expectant crowd ready for a show. I inch my way down along the short passage and there, standing in the cubbyhole space backstage like a beautiful lost waif, isBen Whishaw. It hits me how different he looks in full costume. We lock eyes and hug. We hold each other for a few moments, trying to breathe in sync and to connect. We can both feel the adrenaline pumping and rushing through each other. A final squeeze and I turn away and walk back to the edge of the wings where we are to make our entrance.My breathing is steady, but my heart is pump-pump-pumping. This is as close as I get to full-on nervous. I am not afraid though. It’s excitement; anticipation; a sexy, knowing thrill. I know there will be a split second of sheer terror when the call comes though. The moment you know you’re past the point of no return. That thought-memory passes through with the next inhale-exhale. It’s as if I can feel the giddy heat coming off the crowd even back here in the wings, behind the soon-gone shelter of a curtain, feet away from where Vladimir and Estragon will come to life. It’s new and familiar all at once.View image in fullscreenBranching out … crew members decorating the tree.Photograph: Sophie RubensteinI know it’s only been a five-year absence, but my goodness, there’s nothing quite like this pre-show pump. This feeling was my bread and butter for decades, and I have missed it. I feel a definite lump in my throat. My breathing remains steady though. It’s funny how quickly the system remembers. I can think of nowhere else I would rather be than right here, right now. I glance over my shoulder – the whole team’s poised and ready. Ben is by my side. We hold hands in the dark. Finally, the call from deputy stage manager, Sophie Rubenstein: “That’s front of house clearance, guys.”Terror surge inside and we’re off. We stop briefly at the edge of the platform. One last squeeze, then we step on. Ben heads to his starting position under the tree; I get settled on my stone. Just before I sit, I notice Jenny Grand, our company stage manager, ready and waiting to take up her position to rotate the platform. I wave her a “peace sign” to signal that we’re ready and “good luck”. I sit. Take a breath. Then the stage goes dark.The crowd roars from the other side of the curtain. It’s a physical wave of energy like no other. The thrill of seeing something for the first time. The thrill of us doing something for them for the first time; nothing quite like it. Curtain goes up, platform rotates, lights up and we’re off.Both Ben and I belt out our first few lines with the tight, pumped punch of seasoned pros back in the game. I can feel the cold, adrenal sweat down my back. I’m performing – aware of myself speaking, of my body coursing with too much energy, of my mind razor-sharp and focused, aware of 800 bodies cheering us on, aware of my castmate playing alongside me. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, in a kind of warped slow-motion, I’m caught off guard by a laugh we’ve never had before.View image in fullscreenThe cast in an existential heap during rehearsals at London Welsh Centre.Photograph: Sophie RubensteinI hear Ben, as Vladimir, saying the end of his line “… we should have thought of it a million years ago, in the 90s.”Which is my – Estragon’s – cue to say,“Ah stop blathering and help me off with this bloody thing.”View image in fullscreenThe sole of Estragon … Lucian Msamati’s boots.Photograph: Lucian MsamatiI only get as far as, “Ah stop blathering …” as the crowd erupts into raucous, hysterical laughter.

The crowd is hysterical. I can’t help but feel a slight sense of relief when I see them; reinforcements at last. As Vladimir would say. I am very aware of my breath and of the now ice-cold sweat down my back. I notice the sweat on all of us.Jon, Jon, Jon! So calm, so effortless vocally. A master at work. He even manages an extra laugh at the end of his “the same is true of the laugh” line. The crowd naturally laughs at the line, and then, cool as you like, without breaking the rhythm, as the crowd’s laugh dies down, he points out to them and mutters a just audible, “Hmm, see?” The crowd roars hysterically once more. Watch and learn, kids; watch and fucking learn.The irresistible rise of Lucian Msamati – in picturesRead moreAnd then Tom; ah, Tom! You flipping genius! Delivers his Lucky speech like it’s a new-minted thing. If ever there’s a masterclass on how to “turn it on” – in the right, proper and professional manner, that is – it’ll be Tom Edden delivering it. He has the crowd eating out of the palm of his hand. Ben wrenches off Lucky’s hat at the appropriate point to stop his stream-of-consciousness speech, and the crowd goes wild. But Tom doesn’t collapse straight away. He holds the moment, waits for the frenzy to die down and then he falls. The crowd goes wild again! I turn my head ever-so-slightly upstage, breaking character a bit, to mask a giddy smile-chuckle. No worries, I’m sure. All eyes are on Edden at this moment; I’ll take a few seconds’ respite to privately break character and enjoy the brilliance of my colleagues, thank you very much.We get through the play. The crowd is on their feet at the curtain call. For a brief moment, as we lap up the adulation we probably don’t really deserve but will absolutely take, I get a proper glimpse of the crowd. It’s young, old, in-between, black, white, brown and absolutely, unanimously loving us. Final bow. House lights up, curtain down and we fall into an elated-exhausted group hug. I burst into tears; then the tears are gone as quickly as they came.This is an edited extract fromThe Godot Diaries: Behind the Scenes of Beckett’s Playby Lucian Msamati (Methuen Drama)Explore more on these topicsTheatreBen WhishawSamuel BeckettActingWest EndfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A final album and tour by the thrash metal pioneers was announced last August, with an AI-assisted video and a written statement that offered some classic grandstanding on the part of frontman and sole original member Dave Mustaine. Never a man to hide his light under a bushel, he equated Megadeth’s decision to quit with a global catastrophe (“some say this is the end of times”) and suggested that the US band “changed the world”.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Megadeth.Photograph: Publicity imageTheir decision to quit makes sense, given the state of Mustaine’s health. Having conquered throat cancer and radial neuropathy, he’s now suffering from arthritis and something called Dupuytren’s contracture – a thickening of tissue under the skin that causes the fingers to bend, commonly known as the suitably metal-sounding Viking disease – both of which impede his ability to play guitar. The call to end the band was made during the recording of their self-titled 17th studio album. But then three months later Mustaine announced that the farewell dates announced were only the beginning. The tour is scheduled to last “easily … three to five years”. So there seems every chance that Megadeth will still be bidding the world adieu in the next decade.Still, there is a definite sense of finality to this new music. Rather than a full-blooded return to the genre their early albums helped birth, it effectively offers listeners a career-summarising redux. Some tracks certainly underline their position as thrash metal progenitors, most notably the flatly superb opener Tipping Point, as well as Made to Kill and Let There Be Shred. The latter would be completely preposterous were it not musically potent enough to make up for the lyrics “on the day I was born, a guitar in my hand, the earth started rumbling a thunderous command … let there be shred!” (There are also images of fingers combusting, guitars squealing in delight as they’re beaten to death, pretenders being destroyed, etc.)On I Don’t Care, you get the punkish leanings that led Megadeth to cover Anarchy in the UK in 1988. More surprisingly, there are tracks rooted in the more melodic style the band controversially pursued in the mid-to-late 90s. If there’s a certain screw-you bullishness about this – 1997’s Cryptic Writings and 1999’s Risk seldom rank high among Megadeth fans’ favourite albums – there’s also a sense of Mustaine underlining that he’s actually pretty good at turning his attentions towards the radio-friendly, regardless of what he’s really known for: Puppet Parade in particular is really well written.Megadeth: Puppet Parade – videoAll of this is performed with the kind of technical precision for which Megadeth have long been famed: whatever one makes of the band’s constant lineup changes – the headcount of former members stands at 28 – contemporary guitarist Teemu Mäntysaari fits the band’s approach perfectly. But there are problems. The second half of the album noticeably lags, as if its career-summarising approach stretches to reminding listeners of the declining inspiration that’s haunted Megadeth’s fair-to-middling recent releases: Obey the Call is musically boring and laden with lyrics about ghostly puppetmasters controlling the world’s evils, reflecting Mustaine’s increasingly cranky and conspiracy-driven worldview, appearances on Infowars and all. He ends with The Final Note, which can’t work out whether it’s intent on tugging at longstanding fans’ heartstrings – “the final curtain falls, a quiet end to it all, now it’s just memories” – or heading off into retirement with middle finger aloft: “My last will, my final testament … my sneer.”Release the beast! How Iron Maiden and a naked Ralph Fiennes created the ultimate big-screen needle dropRead moreBut it isn’t his final sneer. That comes with a bonus track in which Megadeth take on Ride the Lightning, one of a handful of Metallica songs that Mustaine contributed to before being unceremoniously ejected from the band in 1983. It seems a weird way to conclude things: why end an album intended to celebrate your band’s legacy by dredging up the spectre of your sacking from another band? It’s certainly not as if Megadeth’s version radically reinvents the song in “this is how it’s done” style, beyond sounding more polished and growling. Is it a matter of underlining his claimed ownership over some of Metallica’s early material? Or simply for the purpose of grabbing extra attention for Megadeth’s final album? But then, Dave Mustaine has rarely needed much prompting to pick at the subject of being ousted from Metallica over the intervening 40-plus years. If nothing else, bringing it up one last time is very on brand, as is the rest of Megadeth, good and bad.This week Alexis listened toKavari – Iron VeinsNew Year cobwebs instantly blown away by the first track from Glasgow producer Kavari’s forthcoming EP: trace elements of old school hardcore, mid-90s Aphex Twin, industrial, but a finished product all her own.Explore more on these topicsMegadethAlexis Petridis's album of the weekMetalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Just total darkness, the sound of gentle dripping and a creeping feeling of unease. The switch is flicked back on and the shadowy world that lies deep beneath the Karst returns. I’m in Vilenica, thought to bethe first cave in the world ever opened to tourists, with records of visitors dating back to 1633. It’s a magical sight: a grand antechamber sculpted through erosion, filled with soaring stalagmites and plunging stalactites streaked in shades of red, terracotta and orange by iron oxide, and dotted with shimmering crystals.Vilenica is just one of a network of thousands of caves located in the Karst region of western Slovenia and eastern Italy, which is known for its porous, soluble limestone rock. Above ground, this creates a distinctive landscape, filled with rocks bearing lined striations and pockmarked by hollows known as dolines, where the limestone has collapsed underneath. But below ground is where it’s really special, with enormous caves, sinkholes and subterranean rivers. Later in the day, I visit the region’s other main visitor cave, Škocjan, where I’m amazed to see an underground river thunder through a chamber almost 150 metres high. It’s an almost surreal sensory experience, with the rush of the rapids echoing around the walls.Slovenia and ItalyAs my guide drives me through the Karst region, I watch the undulating hills of a comparatively untouched stretch of countryside go by, dotted with a patchwork of bilingual villages connecting eastern Italy and western Slovenia along a border that shifted several times over the 20th century. Increasingly, the area is viewing itself as one region spanning two countries, and is hoping to combat the overtourism plaguing Italy and Slovenia’s better-known destinations by attracting people in search of a slower, more authentic and local experience. To showcase its shared history, nature and culture, the region has established a new EU-funded cross-border geopark, known asGeoKarst, and is hoping to secure Unesco designation.View image in fullscreenTypical Karst region countryside around the Škocjan cave.Photograph: robertharding/AlamyWinding around the region’s hills, I reach its highlight – Štanjel, a medieval village that wouldn’t look out of place in Provence, but without the crowds. Wandering around its cobbled streets feels like stepping back a millennium, or in some cases longer, given the village has prehistoric and Roman origins. The flint-grey buildings are made of sturdy local Karst stone, which has stayed more or less intact for hundreds of years. At sunset, I sit with a glass of crisp local vitovska wine inBistro Grad, a prettily decorated restaurant garlanded with dried flowers, and take in sweeping views of the gilded valley beneath.It's a distinctive landscape, filled with rocks bearing lined striations and pockmarked by hollows  where the limestone has collapsedLeaving Slovenia, we venture over to the Karst’s Italian side, where it is flanked byTrieste, a vibrant university city that blends Italian culture with Viennese art nouveau architecture courtesy of its lengthy stint as the Austro-Hungarian empire’s sole port. Locals say the cultural blend has given it a uniquely open-minded and tolerant spirit. My guide, Beatriz Barovina, tells me that unlike elsewhere in Italy, you can eat, sip an espresso or drink a glass of wine alone without being judged for not having a big Italian family around you. She says there is still a strong attachment to Austria, especially among older generations, who cling to the refrain: “It was better under Austria.”View image in fullscreenThe hilltop village of Štanjel.Photograph: Natalia Schuchardt/AlamyLocals tell me that as well as the buzzy cafe culture, they love Trieste for its easy access to nature. Heading out of the city centre for 15 minutes, we reach the 3-mile Via Napoleonica route, which offers panoramic views of Trieste’s bay, and connects the small towns of Opicina and Prosecco, birthplace of the eponymous sparkling wine.A place at the farmer’s table on a foodie trip to TriesteRead moreIt’s easy to eat well in the Karst region because most produce is sourced from local farmers. One unique experience is a visit to a localosmice, family-run farms and vineyards. AtCantina Parovel, the family serve homemade cheese, wine, prosciutto, honey and olive oil on picnic tables shaded by pines. The Parovel family is proud to boast its distinctively Karst pedigree to me: three generations of the family were born in the same village, yet their grandparents were born in the Austro-Hungarian empire, the parents in Italy, and the children in Slovenia.Theirosmiceis located at the end of a spectacular 4-mile hike through the Rosandra valley, if you start in the village of Mihele and partly follow stage 36 of theAlpe Adria Trail, cutting through a landscape of wild cherry trees and roe deer. If you’re lucky you might even stumble upon one of the improvised “wine caves” – hollows in which people leave local wines and cheeses on an honesty-bar basis for hungry and thirsty travellers – with carved wooden seating overlooking the valley below.It’s a uniquely Karst experience, and one that reflects the region’s two most distinctive features: its striking landscape and welcoming, communitarian spirit.The trip was provided byPromo Turismo FVG, the tourist board of Friuli-VeneziaGiulia, andVisit Krasin Slovenia.

Then came more alarming rumours: the dunder pits had overflowed.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Dunder pit? This is the one of the most distinctive features of traditional Jamaican rum, a style exemplified by Hampden, which has been in operation since 1753. You typically make rum by fermenting molasses and/or sugar cane juice into an alcoholic “wash”, then distil that into a potent liquor, but local distillers developed several strategies to oomph up the flavour. Dunder is the leftover liquid from the still, and it’s lobbed into the next fermentation for its funky notes, a bit like a sourdough starter. At Hampden, they also use muck, an outrageously smelly, semi-sentient soup containing countless billions of yeast bacteria, plus various bits of decomposing, well,stuff. I’m not sure what would happen if you fell in: possibly die, or perhaps be granted infinite powers,Obelix-style. Then there’s the fermentation process itself: most distilleries use generic industrial yeasts, which typically convert sugars to alcohol over a couple of days, but at Hampden they harness wild yeasts, which can take weeks. Incidentally, Andrew Hussey, Hampden’s owner, has reported that production is now safe, though the communities who live and work around the distillery remain badly affected.We’ve heard a lot about the miraculous powers of fermented foods such as kimchi and kefir, and I’m not going to pretend that Jamaican rum will do anything for your microbiome, but these tiny universes of microbes do have miraculous effects on flavour, giving Jamaican rum its distinctive, bassy funk, orhogo. Hampden’s signature 1753 blend, for instance, has rich tropical fruit, deep baking aromas, nail varnish, glue, Marmite, leather, spice, animal spirits. Try it neat or in a Kingston negroni, for which it’s subbed in for the usual gin.Rum has boomed in recent years, and really why wouldn’t it? It’s approachable and mixable, less up itself than scotch or cognac, and has the most interesting history, too. Alas, however, it is more “spiced rum” that has gained favour with British drinkers – a generic, sweetened spirit mixed with aggressive vanilla, much of it fit only for knocking back pre-amputation. Hampden however, exemplifies a welcome counter-trend in the Caribbean for distilleries to lean on their own distinctive rum-making traditions and produce liquids that are as much an expression of place as wine is. That hasn’t always been a given, thanks to the vagaries of colonialism and its illegitimate heir, capitalism.Jamaica is synonymous with rum, but for decades most of its rum was sold in bulk to exporters and blended and aged in Europe. However, since it gained a Geographical Indication for rum in 2016, local producers have been working hard to make Jamaican rum Jamaican again. The oldest surviving distillery,Appleton Estate(1749!) was the first to employ a Jamaican female master blender, the redoubtableJoy Spence, and now ages all of its rums on the island, which concentrates those tropical flavours. Then there isWorthy Parkin the south, where they have revived sugar cane production to make a rum that is truly an expression of its locale. You could equally do far worse thanWray & Nephew, the iconic overproof white rum that is far and away the most popular on the island itself, and makes an evil daiquiri; 90% of Jamaicans cannot be wrong.Four Jamaican classicsHampden Estate 1753£57.25 (700ml; on offer) The Whisky Exchange, 46%.

Some, such as Jeanne Carola Francesconi’s epic 1965 La Cucina Napoletana, were reprints of established books, while others were specially commissioned for the series. There is considerable variation; some of the 20 regions occupy 650 densely filled pages, sometimes spread over two volumes, while other regions have 236 pages with larger fonts, with everything in between. All of which is great, although I can’t help feeling affectionate towards the regions with 14-point font.In the face of the vast variation of regional culinary habits, knowledge and rituals, I also feel affectionate towards the common traditions; those that are specific to a place, but at the same time that cross local and national borders, as well as for the stories of the ingredients. Takepasta e fagioli, for which beans are boiled in water with fat, maybe fragrant herbs and vegetables, then pasta is added for a dense dish that probably needs a spoon. Almost all regions (and towns and individuals) have a version that is both extremely general, and specific – white beans, potato, no rosemary in Lazio, say; lardo, sage and plenty of rosemary in Piedmont; nutmeg, bread and pasta in Liguria; lardo, marjoram, tomato and chilli in Abruzzo – inviting a sort of pick and mix. And the embracing of new ideas, too, because cooking is a living, evolving thing.Cesare Battisti, head chef and owner ofRatanà in Milan, is great on all this, noting that: “It’s true that we need to be custodians of tradition, but we also need to have a little courage to desecrate it a little, and in an intelligent way, but we have to do it.” It is with these words that he suggests a pasta e fagioli that follows a familiar pattern – soaked beans added to a soffritto, followed by water, then pasta – but then also takes inspiration from Thailand and includes coconut cream, spring onion, chilli and optional lemon.We were delighted by the contents of our steaming bowls, and especially the addition of that coconut cream, which softens the colour to taupe and makes the dish feel luxurious while remaining fresh. I agree with Battisti when he suggests it must be hot with chilli, but, of course, you decide. The same applies to the lemon (“ingrediente inaspettato”,or unexpected ingredient), which turns the dish around like a bright spark.I will leave the last word to Battisti: “Questi piatti non sono da discutere, sono da provare, dovete provare a rifarli, provate.”Which is to say: these aren’t dishes to discuss, these are dishes to be tried. Although you could also try, then discuss.Pasta e fagioli with coconut, spring onion, chilli and lemonServes4200g dried borlotti beans, soaked overnight in plenty of cold water5 tbsp olive oil3 spring onions, white bulbs diced, green parts thinly sliced1 stickcelery, diced1 small carrot, peeled and diced1 fresh red chilli, sliced2 sprigs fresh rosemary, 1 picked and minced, the other left whole2-3 tbspcoconut cream200gtagliatelle, roughly broken upJuice of1lemon(optional)Drain and rinse the soaked beans. Put the olive oil, spring onion whites, celery, carrot, half the red chilli, and all the rosemary in a heavy-based pan and cook on a medium-low heat, stirring, until the vegetables start to soften and turn translucent. Add the soaked beans, one and a half litres of fresh water and a pinch of salt, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for an hour, or until the beans are soft.Remove half the soup, blend it smooth, then return to the pan with the coconut cream and salt to taste. Put the pan back on the heat and bring to a lively simmer. Add the broken tagliatelle and simmer, stirring regularly, until the pasta is cooked – you might need to add a bit more water.Serve, topping each bowl with the sliced spring onion greens and a little extra chopped red chilli, and encouraging those who want to add a squeeze of lemon.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkPastaBeans, pulses and legumesVegetablesThai food and drinkMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"
