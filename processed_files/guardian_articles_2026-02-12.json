Katy Perry – Firework (2010)The oeuvre of Katy Perry occasionally has some profoundly unexpected inspirations: California Gurls is spelt in homage to Big Star’s September Gurls, while Firework was based on, wait for it, Jack Kerouac’s On the Road, specifically the line about how his favourite people “burn like fabulous yellow roman candles”.19. Japanese Breakfast – Magic Mountain (2025)Abestselling author herself, Michelle Zauner’s latest album as Japanese Breakfast referenced Virginia Woolf, John Cheever and, on its sweet but sad acoustic closing track, Thomas Mann’s sanatorium-based door-stopper Magic Mountain. It’s a song that seems to reflect Zauner’s reaction to the book, and deploy its imagery to explore her own relationship with fame and creativity.18. Bomb the Bass – Bug Powder Dust (1994)Bug Powder Dust certainly isn’t the only song inspired by the oeuvre of William Burroughs – he’s the link between Duran Duran’s Wild Boys and Throbbing Gristle’s An Old Man Smiled – but it’s definitely the funkiest. Justin Warfield delivers a Naked Lunch-themed rap, over a writhing bass line and immense breakbeat.17. Taylor Swift – The Bolter (2024)Taylor Swift has described herself as “your favourite English teacher”, a nod to the literary references in her songs. The expanded The Tortured Poets Department featured The Bolter, based on a recurring villain in Nancy Mitford’s novels (in turn based on five-times-married British aristocrat Idina Sackville) who Swift identified with.16. Killer Mike – Willie Burke Sherwood (2012)There are plenty of literary allusions in hip-hop, but Willie Burke Sherwood – Killer Mike’s first collaboration with El-P, with whom he’d later form Run the Jewels – skilfully entwines references to Lord of the Flies through its autobiographical saga of growing up “addicted to literature” in the wrong part of town.15. The Cure – Charlotte Sometimes (1981)The obvious choice for literary Cure is the Camus-inspired Killing an Arab, but let’s instead plump for marvellous goth-pop set text Charlotte Sometimes, its title and theme taken from Penelope Farmer’s splendidly creepy 1969 children’s novel. It clearly lived rent-free in Robert Smith’s head, also inspiring the Cure’s 1984 album track The Empty World.14. Black Star – Thieves in the Night (1998)In the sleeve notes of Mos Def and Talib Kweli’s first album as Black Star, the latter wrote about discovering Toni Morrison’s novel The Bluest Eye. The chorus of Thieves in the Night – a musically mellow, lyrically barbed exploration of racial identity and hip-hop’s perpetuation of stereotypes – is essentially a passage from the novel.13. Nirvana – Scentless Apprentice (1993)At the height of his unhappy celebrity, Kurt Cobain obviously identified with the anti-hero of Patrick Suskind’s Perfume, who’s devoured by his own acolytes. Should you doubt Cobain meant it, listen to the frankly terrifying way he repeatedly sings “go away” – it’s the sound of someone at the end of their tether.12. Radiohead – Street Spirit (Fade Out) (1995)Ben Okri’s Booker-winning novel The Famished Road – about a child trapped between the spirit world and life in Nigeria – inspired the drift of disturbing, dream-like images on The Bends’ closing track, an artistic breakthrough that pointed the way to OK Computer, and struck a rare optimistic note at its conclusion: “Immerse your soul in love.”11. Rosalía – Pienso en Tu Mirá (2018)As if to prove from the start that she was noticeably different to your average 21st-century pop star, every track on Rosalía’s first album of original material was based on a chapter from the 13th-century Occitan romance Flamenca: Pienso en Tu Mirá’s amazing confection of flamenco rhythms, dancefloor bass and spectral pop is chapter three.10. David Bowie – We Are the Dead (1974)Bowie famously wanted to write a musical based on George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, but the writer’s estate refused permission. Of the fragments that made their way on to Diamond Dogs, We Are the Dead is the pick, not least because it’s the most thrillingly diseased, decadent-sounding five minutes that the glam era produced.9. The Normal – Warm Leatherette (1978)The influence of JG Ballard’s dystopian science fiction hung heavy over post-punk, from Gary Numan to Joy Division, but never seemed more pointed than on Daniel Miller’s groundbreaking single inspired by 1973’s Crash. Unsettling but danceable, the awesome Warm Leatherette perfectly captures the novel’s disturbingly cold treatment of violence, horror and sexual arousal.8. Kendrick Lamar – King Kunta (2015)A lesson in African American literature bound up in four minutes of firecracker rapping set to a superlatively funky backing. The title comes from Alex Haley’s 1976 novel Roots, but the lyrics of King Kunta divert into references to Ralph Ellison’s 1952BildungsromanInvisible Man, and Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart.7. Magazine – A Song From Under the Floorboards (1980)Some songs are only tangentially linked to their literary inspirations, but Magazine’s masterpiece of tense, brooding post-punk existential dread is so clearly inspired by Dostoevsky’s novella Notes From Underground – check out their respective opening lines! – that the Russian author possibly deserved a co-writing credit.6. Kate Bush – The Sensual World (1989)Wuthering Heights is better known, but its brilliance in rendering a classic novel is equalled by The Sensual World, inspired by James Joyce’s Ulysses. Bush was denied the rights to use Joyce’s actual text, so she translated Molly Bloom’s reverie into a song that’s beautiful, drowsy, amatory and better than the subsequent version that did use Joyce’s words.5. Joni Mitchell – Both Sides Now (1969)The lyrics were sparked by Mitchell reading Saul Bellow’s 1959 novel Henderson the Rain King while on a plane; a passage about clouds inspired the opening verses. Both Sides Now is a song Mitchell has grown into. If you want the most emotionally impactful version, hear her singing it, aged 79, on her Live at Newport album.4. Jefferson Airplane – White Rabbit (1967)Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland transformed into one of the jewels of parent-scaring American psychedelia, White Rabbit is effectively the Merry Pranksters’ challenge –Can YOUpasstheacidtest?– in musical form. In a slightly foreboding tone, it jumbled Lewis Carroll’s imagery to evoke a jarring, brain-scrambling departure from normality.From Dylan to Ishiguro: can song lyrics ever be literature?Read more3. Joy Division – Dead Souls (1980)The late Ian Curtis’s library ranged from Sven Hassel to Kafka, Burroughs and Ballard: all made their way into his songs. On Dead Souls, the titular deceased of Nikolai Gogol’s satirical novel crowd into his Curtis’s head, “calling” him against his will. “Someone take these dreams away,” he pleads, to desperate, chilling effect.2. The Velvet Underground – Venus in Furs (1967)Lou Reed’s stated aim was to invest rock’n’roll with the quality of literature: he never achieved it more successfully than when inspired by Leopold Von Sacher-Masoch’s infamous 1870 novel. A wall of detuned guitar and scraping, droning viola, Venus in Furs is both menacing and hypnotically alluring: a perfect musical embodiment of its subject matter.1. The Rolling Stones – Sympathy for the Devil (1968)Marianne Faithfull’s suggestion that Mick Jagger read Mikhail Bulgakov’s The Master and Margarita may well be the most fortuitous literary recommendation in rock history. The resulting song was fantastic, the malevolence and amorality of Jagger’s lyric amplified by the music: with its samba-derived rhythm and ecstatic whoops, it sounded not ominous but inviting. Moreover, it was timely: the psychedelicised optimism of the summer of love had begun to erode; the world seemed to be getting darker – Jagger pluralised a line about President Kennedy’s assassination to reflect the news of his brother Bobby’s murder – and attitudes were hardening. Sympathy for the Devil was the perfect soundtrack to the curdling of the 60s. Fifty-eight years on, it still sounds incredible.Explore more on these topicsMusicRankedPop and rockFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Something thrilling today is always positive, but in its earliest incarnation, to thrill meant to pierce someone with a sword rather than with excitement. The literal meaning of thrill was a hole, which is why our nostrils began as our nose-thrills, or nose holes.apricityThis is one of the many words in the Oxford English Dictionary that were recorded only once before fading away like a linguistic mayfly. Apricity, from 1623, means the warmth of the sun on a winter’s day. The word is as beautiful as the sensation it describes.susurrusSay this word out loud and you will know its meaning instantly. Susurrus comes from the Latin for whispering and describes the rustling of leaves in a summer breeze.bags of mysteryThis Victorian nickname for sausages always makes me smile. It was inspired by the fact that you can never quite know what’s in them.snerdleEnglish has a vast lexicon for snuggling, from nuddling, neezling and snoozling to snuggening, croodling and snerdling. Each of them expresses the act of lying quietly beneath the covers. Mind you, if you lie there a little bit too long, you could be accused of hurkle-durkling, old Scots for staying in bed long after it’s time to get up.splendiferousAnother of Soreen’s picks, this word has a distinct touch of Mary Poppins about it. In the middle ages it meant simply resplendent, but since the 19th century it has been a humorous description of anything considered rather magnificent.ruthfulThe historical dictionary is full of lost positives – words whose negative siblings are alive and well while their parents have faded away. As well as being gormless, inept, unkempt, uncouth and disconsolate, you could in the past be full of gorm, ept, kempt, couth, and consolate. Best of all is surely ruthful, the counterpart to ruthless which means full of compassion.muscleAnother word with a hidden backstory, and this one often makes children laugh. In ancient times, athletes would exercise in the buff in order to show off their rippling muscles (the words gym and gymnasium go back to the Greek for exercise naked). To the Roman imagination, when an athlete flexed their biceps, it looked as though a little mouse was scuttling beneath their skin. Our word muscle consequently comes from the Latinmusculus, little mouse.Explore more on these topicsLiteracyChildrenCountdownnewsShareReuse this content"

From your lift pass to your equipment hire, transfers, travel andaccommodation, it’s not a particularly accessible sport. Luckily, there are ways to curb your spending if you’re heading to the slopes – one of which is your choice of ski gear.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There are several reasonably priced brands that provide quality for a fraction of the price of luxury labels. Sure, you won’t be buying the most technologically advanced gear – if you’re a seasoned skier tackling extreme weather off piste, a high-street jacket probably won’t cut it – but if you’re a touch more fairweather, like me, these products will do the job just fine. And some brands offer a high spec for a relatively reasonable price, too – the North Face and Tog24 always put performance first, for example.I’ve found the best brands for affordable ski gear, from high-street stores to independent labels. And I’ve included a few tips and tricks for those new to the pistes, too.The best affordable ski-wear brandsView image in fullscreenOur writer hits the slopes in his best skiing togs.Photograph: Peter Bevan/The GuardianBest high-street ski-wearBest valueski-wear:M&S GoodmoveView image in fullscreenMen’s salopettes£79.20 at M&SView image in fullscreenWomen’s base layer leggings£28.80 at M&SView image in fullscreenSocks£10 at M&SYou may not think of Marks & Spencer as a place for technical wear, but the British high-street store’s activewear label,Goodmove, offers many things, from running gear to gym kit and, of course, ski-wear. The selection isn’t huge, but it covers the essentials – thermal layers, weatherproof jackets, gloves … and salopettes in a snowy camo print. They’re made with a breathable, waterproof finish and taped seams, and though they won’t withstand anythingtooextreme, they’ll keep you dry when you’re cruising down the slopes in decent conditions.Best for a wide range of affordable ski gear:Mountain WarehouseView image in fullscreenMen’s ski jacketand pant set£64.99 at Mountain WarehouseView image in fullscreenWomen’s ski jacket£94.99 at Mountain Warehouse£99.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenUnisex ski helmet£32.99 at Mountain WarehouseMountain Warehouse is a one-stop shop foraffordable ski-wear(and gear for other outdoorsy activities, such as climbing, hiking or camping), and it’s the store’s own-brand products that offer the best value. Its ski-wear has grown to become a comprehensive range: there are jackets, boots, goggles, socks, trousers, snoods, hats, thermals and more.My top pick is the coordinatingtwo-piece jacket-and-pant sets, which are reduced to less than £100. They’re fairly basic, aesthetically, but if you simply want well-made pieces that will keep you warm and dry for a fair RRP, consider yourself sorted.Best for minimal Scandi ski gear:H&M MoveView image in fullscreenMen’s ski jacket£179.99 at H&MView image in fullscreenWomen’s ski trousers£89.99 at H&MView image in fullscreenSkisocks£22.99 at H&MH&M’s in-house activewear brand,Move, has a small range of snow gear, and it’s one of the best on the high street in terms of quality. The outerwear is waterproof, windproof and breathable, and it all comes in a selection of muted colours; I’m a big fan of the dusty green jacket and salopettes. Elsewhere, thethermal base layerand socks are insulated with wool for extra warmth. A few of the pieces are a little low in stock, so if you see anything you like, snap it up.Best for trend-led ski gear:Asos 4505View image in fullscreenMen’s ski suit£87 at AsosView image in fullscreenWomen’s belted ski suit£110.50 at AsosView image in fullscreenSki gloves£12.10 at AsosThe ski gear atAsos 4505– the retailer’s activewear line – feels trendy.Cropped bombers,faux fur collars, poppy colours such as lilac and fern green andretro puffer ski suits. If you prefer it low key, there are also a few classic black pieces in the selection, but be warned: they may make it harder for your friends to spot you on a crowded piste.From a technical perspective, the gear isn’t particularly advanced: there’s no officially tested waterproof or breathability ratings or high-end membranes such as Gore-Tex or Polartec, for instance. On the other hand, there are plenty of useful extras, including jacket sleeve ski pass pockets, ski boot gaiters on the trousers and taped seams. Best suited to those who want to look good while skiing a few blues before heading to apres around 3pm.Independent ski brandsBest forperformance gear that looks great:MontecView image in fullscreenMen’s snowboard jacket£180 at MontecView image in fullscreenWomen’s ski jacket£200 at MontecView image in fullscreenSki goggles£113 at MontecWhen I went skiing in January, the brand I saw most on the slopes was Montec – and it makes sense. The Swedish label provides high performance for a price that’s more reasonable than some of its competitors – mainly because it foregoes the traditional markup that comes with selling through a third party. And it looks cool, too.Expect 20,000mm of waterproofing (a fabric that can withstand a 20-metre column of water pressing against it before leaking; often known as 20k) and 20,000g/m²/24h breathability (meaning 20kg of water vapour can pass through over 24 hours; also often known as 20k) ratings, as well as hi-tech details such as underarm vents, an easy-access phone pocket and storm guard protection. I love thejacket-and-trousersets, withthermalsto match.Best forsnowboarders:DopeView image in fullscreenMen’s anorak jacket£165 at DopeView image in fullscreenWomen’s base layer£52 at DopeView image in fullscreenFace mask£26 at DopeDope is owned by the same parent company as Montec but is more streetwear inspired, aimed at the snowboarding crowd, with a roomy cut and statement logos. The spec is a touch lower, too, with 15k waterproof and breathability ratings–but it’s also a little cheaper, so you get what you pay for.You can choose fromprinted outerwearor boldblock coloursas well aspull-over hoodie jackets,logo base layersandgogglesthat are the same as Montec’s but with a different head strap. The pullover silhouette of the anorak jacket offers better protection because there’s no full-length front zip (particularly good for boarders who tend to fall more).Best for reliable, budget-friendly ski gear:Tog24View image in fullscreenMen’s quarter-zip base layer£24 at Tog24£24 at AmazonView image in fullscreenWomen’s ski jacket£99 at Tog24£99 at DecathlonView image in fullscreenMen’s ski socks£30 at Tog24£30 at AmazonIf you’re after reliable, functional ski gear you can trust, you can’t go wrong with Tog24. The West Yorkshire-based, family-run brand makes durable gear for a great price, from outerwear to helmets, base layers, accessories, gloves, socks and goggles.Both thejacketsand thesalopettes(all of which cost under £200) are waterproof and breathable: the cheaper options have a 10k rating for both, while those that are higher-spec tend to cost a little more. And although the aesthetics are fairly simple – low-key colours and minimal logos – the understated look is actually pretty chic. Thecolour-blocked jackets, which come in blue or green for men andpurple and grey for women, caught my eye, as well as these silvermirrored goggles.Best for hi-tech ski gear on a budget:VolcomView image in fullscreenDLM ski jacket£206.99 at Urban Surfer£220 at VolcomView image in fullscreenGore-Tex trousers£281.99 at Urban Surfer£300 at VolcomView image in fullscreenGore-Tex gloves£120 at VolcomVolcom started as a brand for board sports – surfing, skating and, of course, snowboarding. Based in Orange County, California, the collections have a very SoCal feel. The ski jackets, for example, have offbeat touches, such as applique logos, fun colour combos and baggy silhouettes – and they all come with coordinating oversized trousers. I love the retro-inspired DLM jacket, and there’s a great range ofgloves, too, but this Gore-Tex-treated pair would be my top choice.The entry-leveljackets, which sit around the £200 to £300 mark, have at least 15k waterproofing and breathability and well-considered details, from a chin guard to a cinched hood (so you can make it fit with or without your helmet on), built-in hand warmers, a pocket for your ski pass and powder skirts for snow protection.Advanced ski-wearBest ski gear for a mid-range price:the North FaceView image in fullscreenMen’s Chakal trousers£135 at the North Face£157.89 at Snow + RockView image in fullscreenWomen’s Refina top£80 at the North Face£80 at SelfridgesView image in fullscreenWhimzy hood£24 at the North FaceAlthough the North Face’s RRP is a little higher, the quality speaks for itself. Expectweatherproof Gore-Tex treatment, patentedFuturelight technologythat balances waterproofing with breathability, and durable textiles designed to deal with harsh environments. And, since it’s a brand with cachet, you’ll be respected on the slopes, too.Entry-levelsoft-shelljackets cost about £300 at RRP, whilethose with more insulationcan set you back upwards of £400 at full price. Thesnow pantsare about £200. But towards the end of the season, there’s always a good selection reduced.Best for advanced skiers:Helly HansenView image in fullscreenMen’s merino base layer£84.99 at Nevis Sport£85 at Helly HansenView image in fullscreenWomen’s ski jacket£286.62 at Direct-Running£410 at Helly HansenView image in fullscreenBackpack£190 at Helly HansenThe Norwegian brand Helly Hansen has been around since 1877, designing professional-grade outdoor-wear that’s built to withstand extreme environments, such as sailing, hiking and skiing. So, if you’re a confident skier and likely to be going off piste, HH is a good option.The outerwear comes in either insulated or soft shell, and is windproof, waterproof and breathable. The base layers are lightweight yet warm. Every piece is kitted out with hi-tech details, including detachable powder skirts, ventilation zippers, goggle wipes and hand pockets. It’s on the expensive side – but the quality is worth it.TheAlpha long ski shell, for example, costs £480, but it ticks a lotof boxes. It has almost every add-on you could ask for – pockets in all the right places, a three-layer membrane, a powder skirt and adjustable hem and hood, as well as a phone leash to keep your device secure on the lift and even a Life Pocket, which helps it maintain battery in the cold.Best for fashiony ski-wear:J LindebergView image in fullscreenMen’s Ace jacket£210 at J LindebergView image in fullscreenWomen’s knitted sweater£100 at J LindebergView image in fullscreenMittens£77 at J LindebergWhere the North Face and Helly Hansen put practicality first, J Lindeberg is more fashion-centric. The outerwear is waterproof and breathable (mostly with a 20k rating), and the silhouettes feel sophisticated. The prints are elevated. Thecolourpalette is chic, and there’s a good selection of cool, alpine-coded wear, too – think base layers,T-shirts,knitwearandscarves. My favourite pieces arethe creamSwarts jacketand the printed Ace jacket. Check out the knits, too, from achunky ribbed jumperto a statementgraphic print.As you might expect, you’re paying for more stylish design – jackets, for example, cost upwards of £350 at RRP. If you’re happy with a jacket that is more about performance, go with one of the OG experts, such as the North Face or Helly Hansen, instead.Skiing accessoriesBest for ski goggles:OakleyView image in fullscreenO-Frame snow goggles£50 at Discounted Sunglasses£51 at Ellis BrighamOakley’s comprehensive collection of goggles spans everything from advanced designs, such as theFlight Deck Pro, to entry-level options like the O-Frame 2.0. They all come with UV protection, a head strap that allows for a helmet and anti-fog technology – and some have two easily interchangeable lenses that you can alternate depending on the conditions.Best for ski gloves:DecathlonView image in fullscreenLogic 6 ski gloves£39.95 at DecathlonIdeally, you want gloves with a waterproof membrane, long gauntlets to keep out the snow, touchscreen compatibility and leashes that attach to your wrist so you can easily put them on and take them off. Gloves will give you more dexterity than mittens, but mittens are generally easier to pull on and off. You can count on Decathlon for affordable essentials: brands such asSurfanicandTog24are often on offer, or shop the retailer’s in-house ski brands, includingWedzeandRacer. The Logic 6 Polymax gloves are a good, all-round, affordable pair.Best for ski socks:FalkeView image in fullscreenMen’s SK1 socks£34 at Falke£22.78 at AmazonView image in fullscreenWomen’s SK2 socks£34 at Falke£20.99 at AmazonSki socks need to stay warm, dry and comfortable while contending with sweat, cold temperatures andrigid boots, so it pays to choose a pair designed specifically for the job. Enter Falke, the German hosiery brand. Its ski socks are categorised by cushioning levels – from the thicker SK1 to SK6, which offer extra control for advanced skiers. Each comes in a few colours, and they’re all ergonomically designed for a comfy fit using a merino wool blend that’s insulating, moisture-wicking and odour-controlling.What you need to knowView image in fullscreenA jacket, salopettes, thermals, goggles and ski socks are essentials if you’re hitting the slopes for the first timeWhat to pack for your first ski tripIf you’re skiing for the first time, there are a few key pieces of kit you’ll need. A jacket, salopettes or ski pants, thermals (top and bottom), a pair of goggles and ski socks. You can easily hire a helmet, boots and skis in the resort.What type of ski jacket is best for beginners?For versatility, it’s best to go with a fully waterproof and breathable hard-shell jacket with a hood. Go for one that’s not overly insulated because you can easily layer up with thermals and knitwear beneath (just make sure you go with a relaxed fit).If you buy a jacket that’s designed for warmth, it’ll likely be too hot if your trip lands at the end of the season (towards the end of February and March). If you’re someone who really feels the cold, though, one with down or synthetic fill would be better suited.What functional details shouldI look for?There are many add-ons that can make your life easier when you’re hitting the slopes, but some are more essential than others.First, the jacket. You’ll want a ski-pass pocket on the left-hand sleeve to access the ski lifts (you pass through gates that require you to scan your pass on the left). Then, you’ll want an adjustable hood that fits a helmet, ventilation zippers and a chest pocket for your phone. Thumbhole cuffs and a snow skirt are a nice bonus for added snow protection.For ski pants, your wishlist should include snow gaiters, which prevent snow from reaching your boots, watertight taped pockets and an adjustable waist to allow for extra layers.How do I choose the right ski gloves or mittens?It depends on your preference. I prefer ski gloves: they give you more dexterity, which is useful when you’re using your poles or trying to access your zip pockets, and some of them work with touchscreens, too. Mittens will keep your hands warmer, though, so they’re good if you’re sensitive to the cold, and they’re usually easier to pull on and off. Whichever you prefer, look out for a waterproof membrane and a strap that attaches to your wrist.Do ski socks really make a difference?You should always use ski socks. Though it may seemlike an unnecessary expense, it’s an investment that can change your skiing experience. Unlike standard socks, ski socks are designed with extra padding – important when your feet are strapped into stiff boots all day – and use fabrics that are moisture-wicking, breathable and warm.What is the difference between salopettes and ski trousers?The terms are largely interchangeable, but if we’re being specific, salopettes come with braces that go over your shoulders, while ski pants simply button at the waist like normal trousers.Is high-street ski-weargood enough?It depends on what type of skiing you’ll be doing. Ski-wear from high-street stores isn’t always very high-spec, so it may not be ideal if you’re contending with anything extreme – super-cold temperatures, snow, off-piste or high speed, for instance. If you’ll just be resort skiing in fairly good conditions, it should meet your needs – minus a couple of functional features that come with the superior designs. It may not stay in good nick for as long, though, so if you’re planning to ski regularly, it’s better to invest in kit that’s built to last.Packing for a ski trip?

After making a series of life model poses, she removed a scroll from her vagina and began to read her manifesto. In doing so, Schneemann asked an important question: “What does it mean for a female artist to be both the artist and the life model?” Or as she put it: “Both image and image-maker?”The female nude, as depicted and objectified by the male artist, has dominated western art for centuries. Despite decades of feminist efforts, that interaction between the great male genius and his female model – sometimes muse – remains a subject of perennial fascination. To enter a gallery, or to open a university textbook, is to be confronted with a parade of idealised naked females by male artists from Rubens, Titian and Botticelli to Picasso and De Kooning.To some, Carolee Schneemann’s Interior Scroll was a groundbreaking work – to others, it was tasteless pornographyWhen Gwen John stood in her bedroom in 1909 sketching herself nude, her body reflected in a wardrobe mirror, what was she thinking? At the time, she was in the midst of a passionate, unhappy affair with Auguste Rodin, for whom she frequently posed. To pose for herself, though, was different, not to mention daring. John struggled to be her own muse, as opposed to Rodin’s, but this image shows her free from the male gaze.Like many women, the female body – and what it means to live in it – has preoccupied my thoughts throughout my life. Yoko Ono’s portraits for her series My Mommy Is Beautiful are shot from an angle at which we probably all encounter the female body as infants: looking up at our mothers from below. I was 13 or 14 when I read the poem Standing Female Nude byCarol Ann Duffy, told from the perspective of an artist’s model: “Belly nipple arse in the window light, / he drains the colour from me. / Further to the right, / Madame. And do try to be still.”View image in fullscreenFamiliar angles … Yoko Ono with one of her Mommy Is Beautiful works.Photograph: Evan Agostini/Getty ImagesIts quietly devastating final line – “I say / Twelve francs and get my shawl. It does not look like me” – profoundly shifted my perspective, and is now one of the epigraphs to my novel, Female, Nude. The story follows Sophie, a painter commissioned to make a portrait of a female friend while they are on holiday in Greece, and at the same time embarks on an affair with that friend’s ex-lover. It is through Sophie’s engagement with other female artists, all of whom have made nude self-portraits, that the reader learns about her inner world. The novel is punctuated by vignettes that see Sophie standing in front of these works in different galleries, and at varying stages of her life, addressing each artist directly in imagined conversations about art and the female body.The novel grew from the idea of female nudes created by women, particularly self-portraits. For much of western art history, women did not have access to nude models and, if they were brave enough, had to rely on their own bodies. The work they produced was often met with outrage, dismissal, mockery or indifference. To some, Schneemann’s Interior Scroll was a groundbreaking work reclaiming hundreds of years of historical baggage when it comes to the female nude. To others, it was tasteless pornography. Because when a female artist takes authority over depictions of her nudity, it can only be political. It is always a threat to the status quo. (Schneemann had already got in trouble at art college for painting male nudes, an act that was considered almost as disruptive.)View image in fullscreen‘Officially the first’ … Self-portrait by Paula Modersohn-Becke, 1906.Photograph: IanDagnall Computing/AlamyLike Schneemann, the Indian-Hungarian artist Amrita Sher-Gil would cause a furore at school for wanting to paint nudes. In the end, she was kicked out. Sher-Gil went on to paint herself topless in her 1934 work Self-Portrait As a Tahitian – a tribute to Gauguin, or an appraisal of his colonial male gaze, depending on your outlook. The ruthlessness of Gauguin’s gaze crops up again in the work of Emma Amos, who often used her groundbreaking art to critique the whiteness and maleness of the artistic canon. The Amos “nude” I chose to include in my novel is 1994’s Work Suit, in which she wears Lucian Freud’s naked body like a garment in a statement that is both scathing and satirical. She is asking: “Is this what it means to be a great artist?” Amos, who died in 2020, still hasn’t been given her due.As far as I know, no history of the female nude self-portrait has been published, so I set about compiling my own. Officially, the first was made in 1906, by Paula Modersohn-Becker, and it is this painting that opens the novel. The joy of being a novelist, as opposed to an academic, is that you are able to take liberties. Not for me the debate as to whether Artemisia Gentileschi’s nudes count as self-portraits or not, despite the fact that so many of them quite clearly have her face. She’s in my canon which, as well as Amos, includes performance art, from Interior Scroll to Yoko Ono’s Cut Piece (in which members of the audience cut off pieces of Ono’s clothing). Ana Mendieta’s Silueta series of “earth-body” works also features and as does The Woman of Hohle Fels, a mammoth-ivory carving found in a cave, made 40,000 years ago or more.I looked at photographers, too. Some, like Francesca Woodman, are well known for their depictions of their own bodies. I chose her because her nudes capture the inherent strangeness of living in a young woman’s body, an experience that can feel uncanny, gothic almost, but also erotic, powerful, fraught with irony. Others, such as Anne Brigman, who was making nude photographs of herself in the Californian desert as early as 1907, are still often overlooked. These I included in my canon alongside paintings that are more straightforwardly painterly works of self-portraiture by Alice Neel,Jenny Saville, Gwen John and Suzanne Valadon, as well as contemporary artists such as Lisa Brice.View image in fullscreenCaused a furore … Self-Portrait as a Tahitian by Amrita Sher-Gil.Photograph: AlamyAt one stage in her life, Suzanne Valadon could have been the model in Duffy’s poem. She was, after all, “Renoir’s dancer”, and worked her way out of poverty by modelling for many other renowned artists, observing how they worked and learning from them. She is known for her frank, naturalistic approach to the female nude, and her own Self-Portrait With Naked Breasts, from 1931,is no different. Like Neel’s famous self-portrait, it shows a woman and an artist who has lived, given birth and aged, her face a bit of a scowl, her breasts a fact, not for ogling.Female, Nude by Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett review – a seductive drama of art and rivalryRead moreIt is this refutation of the male gaze that unites many of these nudes, but at the same time each of these artists looks beyond it, engaging with what it means to be a woman who makes art in a body that is also the subject of it. Whether it’s ageing (Alice Neel), motherhood (Louise Bourgeois), disability (Frida Kahlo), race (Emma Amos), sexual desire (Tracey Emin), fluidity (Zanele Muholi) or misogyny (Yoko Ono), these artists have done more than expand the definition of the female nude: they have reinvented it in a way that only they could.To quote Sophie, my protagonist, who is imagining a conversation with Artemisia Gentileschi while standing in front of her Susanna and the Elders, a powerful depiction of misogyny and harassment: “Here I am, you’re saying. Let me show you what a woman can do. Because only a woman could have made this.”Female, Nude by Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is published by Tinder (£18.99).

But democratise our economy and a better world is within our graspThu 12 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 12 Feb 2026 17.16 ESTShareWe have an urgent responsibility. Our existing economic system is incapable of addressing the social and ecological crises we face in the 21st century. When we look around we see an extraordinary paradox. On the one hand, we have access to remarkable new technologies and a collective capacity to produce more food, more stuff than we need or that the planet can afford. Yet at the same time, millions of people suffer in conditions of severe deprivation.What explains this paradox? Capitalism. By capitalism we do not mean markets, trade and entrepreneurship, which have been around for thousands of years before the rise of capitalism. By capitalism we mean something very odd and very specific: an economic systemthat boils down to a dictatorship run by the tiny minority who control capital – the big banks, the major corporations and the 1% who own the majority of investible assets. Even if we live in a democracy and have a choice in our political system, our choices never seem to change the economic system. Capitalists are the ones who determine what to produce, how to use our labour and who gets to benefit. The rest of us – the people who are actuallydoingthe production – do not get a say.And for capital, the purpose of production is not primarily to meet human needs or to achieve social progress, much less to deliver on any ecological goals. The purpose is to maximise and accumulate profit. That is the overriding objective. This is the capitalist law of value. And to maximise profits, capital requires perpetual growth – ever increasing aggregate production, regardless of whether it is necessary or harmful.So we end up with irrational forms of production as a result: we get massive production of thingssuch as SUVs, mansions and fast fashion, because these things are highly profitable to capital, but chronic underproduction of obviously necessary things like affordable housing and public transit, because these are much less profitable to capital, or not profitable at all.View image in fullscreen‘Renewables are already much cheaper than fossil fuels. Alas, fossil fuels are up to three times as profitable.’ Tibetan sheep graze at a solar farm in Qinghai province, China, 1 July 2025.Photograph: Ng Han Guan/APSimilarly with energy. Renewables arealready much cheaperthan fossil fuels. Alas, fossil fuels are up tothree times as profitable. Thus capital forces governments to link electricity prices tothe price of the most expensiveliquified natural gas, not of cheap solar energy. Similarly, building and maintaining motorways is many times more lucrative for private contractors, car manufacturers and oil companies than a modern network of superfast, safe public railways. So capitalists continue to push our governments to subsidise fossil fuels and road building, even while the world burns.Since Donald Trump’s election, many major investment firms haveenthusiastically abandonedtheirclimate commitments, which had, in favour of the common good, restrained their profitability. This should be a clarifying moment for all of us: capitalism cares about our species’ prospects as much as a wolf cares about a lamb’s.So here we are: trapped in capitalism’s set of priorities, which are inimical to humanity’s. Human ingenuity has bequeathed us splendid technologies and capacities. But, like a cruel divinity, capital not only prevents us from using them for our collective good, but in fact coerces us to deploy them towards our collective doom.The system also locks us into never-ending cycles of imperialist violence. Capital accumulation in advanced economies relies on massive inputs of cheap labour and nature from the global south. To maintain this arrangement, capital uses every tool at its disposal – debt, sanctions, coups and even outright military invasion to keep southern economies subordinate.The solution is staring us in the face. We urgently need to overcome the capitalist law of value and democratise our economy, so that we can organise production around urgent social and ecological priorities. After all,weare the producers of the goods, the services, the technologies. It isourlabour andourplanet’s resources that are at stake. And sowemust claim the right to decide what is produced, how, and for what purpose.How can this be done? There are three necessary conditions for the transformation of our economy from a dead-end dictatorship into a functioning and ecologically sound democratic one.The first condition is a new financial architecture that penalises destructive private “investments” and enables public finance for public purposes. At the heart of this architecture we need a new public investment bank that, in association with the central banks, converts available liquidity into the types of investment consistent with common, sustainable prosperity.The second condition is the extensive use of deliberative democracy to decide sectoral, regional and national goals (eg regarding the growth or even winding down of different outputs) towards which the new public finance tools will be aimed.Perilous and chaotic, Trump’s ‘liberation day’ endangers the world’s broken economy – and him | Martin KettleRead moreAnd the third condition is a Great Corporate Reform Act for the purpose of democratising corporations, favouring and promoting the formation of companies run along the lines of one employee, one share, one vote.We live in a shadow of the world we could create. A world in which we shall be able to avert an almost certain ecological collapse, rather than waiting around for capitalism to push us beyond the point of no return. A world where the abolition of economic insecurity, precarity, poverty, unemployment and indignity is possible, while we lead meaningful lives within planetary boundaries. This is not a distant dream. It is a tangible prospect.Jason Hickel is professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and a visiting senior fellow at LSE.

One person described the mood as “sulphurous” over the prime minister’s apparent willingness to let senior officials go.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said the cabinet secretary had become the “latest person Keir Starmer has thrown under the bus to save his own skin”.SeniorLabourfigures and the former permanent secretary Simon McDonald also cautioned against an expedited process to appoint Romeo, saying due diligence must be thorough given the high turnover of staff at the heart of No 10.Whitehall sources, however, strongly defended the decision to press ahead with Romeo if the civil service commissioner approves, because she was considered an appointable candidate only just over a year ago.They said Wormald lost Starmer’s confidence over the process that led to Mandelson’s approval for the role of ambassador, and for not having been proactive enough at driving through civil service reform. He is likely to receive a significant payout, with his salary having been about £200,000 a year.No 10, on Thursday night, did not deny reports that Starmer had been forced to overrule official objections to Wormald getting a £260,000 payout through a formal “ministerial direction”.This is issued when officials cannot justify spending on a decision, usually on grounds of value for money.His departure leaves Starmer with a severely depleted team at the top. His chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, and director of communications, Tim Allan, left earlier this week in the aftermath of the Mandelson affair, which laid bare the scale of the former US ambassador’s ties to late child sexual abuse offender Jeffrey Epstein.Starmer’s decision to replace Wormald is understood to have been made days ago, after more than six months of briefings from within No 10 that Starmer’s operation was not convinced he was right for the job.The senior official told permanent secretaries that he was standing down at 10am on Wednesday and left the Cabinet Office for the last time at the end of the day, but it took another 24 hours and more for his departure to be confirmed.“What a message this all gives to public servants, political and official,” one senior government insider said. “Keir Starmer says let’s change things, let’s be bold. But the moment it gets tough, ‘you’ll be out the door to save my skin’.“Antonia will need eyes in the back of her head to spot the knives Keir is wielding.”The Cabinet Office said a process to appoint Wormald’s successor would now take place, with the role to be split temporarily between three senior officials – Romeo, Cat Little and James Bowler.View image in fullscreenAntonia Romeo has impressed as permanent secretary at the Home Office.Photograph: Cabinet OfficeBut some Starmer allies cautioned against an expedited process. “Keir needs to wait for things to calm down before crashing into another set of bad decisions in a panicky way because he’s feeling boxed in. When you’re in a hole, stop digging,” one said.Romeo is seen as a dynamic official outside the traditional civil service mould, in contrast to Wormald who was forced out partly over concerns he was not the right person to drive reform in Whitehall.McDonald, however, said on Wednesday that “more due diligence” and a full appointment process should be run.Romeo has previously faced questions about her spending while consul general in New York in 2017, while working under McDonald at the Foreign Office.A subsequent Cabinet Office investigation cleared her of any wrongdoing. When asked about this on Channel 4, McDonald said he would like to discuss the matter with No 10 as part of its vetting process.Supporters of Romeo hit back strongly in her defence. One minister said: “For decades, our country has wanted to rip up the rulebook and do things differently. Antonia will actually do it. She’s restless, focused, creative and understands the scale of the crises this country faces – the leader our civil service needs in these times.“Frankly, I’m tired of hearing women being called ‘ambitious’ by bald men who’re past their prime. After two establishment men have been found maintaining a relationship with paedophiles, are we going to let another posse of baldies besmirch a brilliant woman who has always riled the establishment by having a bit of chutzpah?”Who is Antonia Romeo and why is she tipped to be the next cabinet secretary?Read moreA government source said of her time in New York: “There is absolutely no basis for this criticism. Antonia Romeo is a highly respected permanent secretary with a 25-year record of excellent public service.“The allegations all come from a single grievance made some time ago by a former employee. All the allegations were dismissed on the basis there was no case to answer.”Romeo won support within the civil service for her warning to Dominic Raab when he was justice secretary about behaviour that led to his being found to have engaged in bullying conduct towards officials. She has impressed Shabana Mahmood at the Home Office.Starmer gave Wormald the job of cabinet secretary in late 2024 despite the panel having recommended another candidate, Tamara Finkelstein, who has now left the civil service.Wormald said: “It has been an honour and a privilege to serve as a civil servant for the past 35 years, and a particular distinction to lead the service as cabinet secretary. I want to place on record my sincere thanks to the extraordinary civil servants, public servants, ministers and advisers I have worked with.“Our country is fortunate to have such dedicated individuals devoted to public service, and I wish them every success for the future.”Starmer said: “I am very grateful to Sir Chris for his long and distinguished career of public service, spanning more than 35 years, and for the support that he has given me over the past year. I have agreed with him that he will step down as cabinet secretary today. I wish him the very best for the future.”No 10 has been criticised over its handling of the situation, with allies of Wormald saying he had been badly treated and learned of his fate through the media.The general secretary of the FDA union, Dave Penman, said the briefing against Wormald had been extraordinary and that it was “no way to run a country”.The former Home Office permanent secretary, Philip Rutnam, also hit out at briefings against civil servants.“The thing that really saps morale is the negative briefing about individual civil servants and the civil service as a whole,” he told Radio 4’s PM programme.“Wherever it comes from, whether it comes from disgruntled ministers or special advisers … civil servants cannot answer back, they are constitutionally bound to be accountable to ministers and good ministers deal with problems behind the scenes.“What you don’t see is briefing coming out into the media, which is deeply destabilising.”Explore more on these topicsCivil serviceKeir StarmerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The British Medical Association (BMA) has said its members could refuse to use parts of the system citing Palantir’s role in targeting ICE raids in the US.Palantir was this week called “ghastly” and “a highly questionable organisation” by MPs in the House of Commons.The fallout over Peter Mandelson’s relationship to the convicted child sexual abuse offender Jeffrey Epstein has also affected the image of Palantir, which employed the former US ambassador’s lobbying company, Global Counsel.Before he was sacked, Mandelson took Starmer to meet Palantir’s chief executive, Alex Karp, at the tech company’s Washington showroom.MPs last week demanded greater transparency around Palantir’s public sector deals, which also include a £240m contract with the Ministry of Defence and with several police forces.In a private briefing forWes Streetingbefore a meeting with Palantir’s European boss, Louis Mosley, in June 2025, Department of Health officials wrote: “The public perception of the [Federated Data Platform (FDP)] during the procurement, and then in delivery, has been affected by the profile of Palantir.“We do not know the extent to which this is impacting on delivery. It is, however, likely to make it harder to go further with the FDP, and to encourage the inclusion of GP data locally.”The briefing was released under the Freedom of Information Act to Foxglove, a tech fairness campaign group.The officials said the rollout had also been affected by debates about patient privacy and concerns that the NHS was being “locked-in” to a single vendor, but added: “Many of these debates are inaccurate and are often as a result of misconceptions.”Donald Campbell, director of advocacy at Foxglove, said: “The prime minister and the health secretary should listen to the public they serve when they tell them Palantir has no place in the NHS.“They should not be scheming with tech billionaires’ staff on how best they can ‘mitigate’ the ‘public perception’ problems these tech giants deservedly face through their own repellent behaviour.”The BMA, which represents NHS doctors, said it has “long opposed the involvement of Palantir in the delivery of care and the use of patient data in our NHS, and it is concerning to see from this briefing that the government felt public concern about Palantir should be dismissed as ‘misconceptions’”.The briefing document suggested Streeting could ask Palantir how to speed up the rollout, and say that the government was keen to “remove unnecessary obstacles” including by revisiting “regulations relating to confidential patient information”.Streeting on Monday sought to show he had “nothing to hide” regarding his relationship with Mandelson by publishing their WhatsApp messages between August 2024 and October 2025.None mentioned Palantir, although in one exchange just over three weeks after Streeting’s meeting with the company, Mandelson encouraged him to visit the US and said: “Need to plan. Lots of tech companies and people to talk to.”New figures released on Thursday showed that the number of NHS organisations using the Palantir technology has increased since June from 118 to 151, which is still well short of the target of 240 by the end of this year.Palantir was co-founded by the Trump supporter and billionaire Peter Thiel, who has previously said “the NHS makes people sick”, and described the British public’s affection for theNHSas a case of “Stockholm syndrome” – the term for hostages who feel a bond with their captors.The former Conservative government minister David Davis said the government now faced a “huge value-for-money issue” over the Palantir contract.He said there had been “naivety in the senior management of the NHS” in awarding a contract to a company with “spectacular baggage in terms of its genesis in the American security state”.“The government is going to have a problem with many hospital trusts and they are going to have really difficult problems with the GPs,” he said. “My best estimate is they will never get most of the GPs with an organisation like Palantir.”John Puntis, co-chair of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign, said: “This looks like another example of a hugely wasteful IT contract, and lack of public trust will make it unworkable.“They ought to end the contract or not renew it. They should accept that the public is very concerned and it is going to make the use of public data very difficult if people think it’s going to be accessed by a company like Palantir.”A spokesperson for Palantir said: “Palantir software is helping to deliver better public services in the UK. That includes delivering 99,000 more NHS operations and reducing hospital discharge delays by 15%, as well as helping the Royal Navy keep ships at sea for longer and the police to tackle domestic violence.”A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “The Federated Data Platform is already delivering for the NHS – helping to join-up patient care, increase hospital productivity, speed up cancer diagnosis and ensure thousands of additional patients can be treated each month.“All providers go through a rigorous, competitive procurement process in line with Government legislation. All data operates under the instruction of the NHS, with strict stipulations in the contract about confidentiality.”NHS England declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthPalantirWes StreetingnewsShareReuse this content"

His lawyer called him a“model immigrant”with no criminal record.On Thursday, it emerged that in April 2009 – a month after Culleton entered the US on a tourist visa – a district court in New Ross, County Wexford,Ireland, issued a warrant over the alleged possession ofdrugsfor sale or supply the previous year. Culleton also faced charges of allegedly obstructing a garda – a police officer – during a search by throwing 25 ecstasy tablets on the ground, the Irish Timesreported.These disclosures have added a new dimension to a case that has become a lightning rod for concern about ongoing ICE immigration sweeps and detentions around the US.Irish man held in ICE detention says he fears for his life and asks Ireland for helpRead moreIn an RTEradio interview earlier this weekfrom a detention centre in El Paso, Texas, Culleton compared conditions there to a concentration camp and said he feared for his safety. He appealed to the Irish government to raise his case with Donald Trump so that he could return to his wife, a US citizen, and his plastering company in the Boston, Massachusetts, area.Politicians and commentators inIrelanddenounced his detention and accused the taoiseach, Micheál Martin, of not doing enough.Culleton, originally from County Kilkenny, entered the US in March 2009 on a visa waiver programme and overstayed the 90-day limit. After marrying a US citizen, Tiffany Smyth, and applying for lawful permanent residence, he obtained a statutory exemption that allowed him to work, according to his lawyer, Ogor Winnie Okoye.Okoye said her client was“the perfect candidate”to have the government exercise favourable discretion on his behalf because he was not a flight risk nor “a criminal of any sort”. She initially gave his age as 42 and on Wednesday corrected that to 38, which matched the date of birth on Irish court records relating to Culleton’s drug case.In a press conference, Okoye said she learned of the case through the media: “This is the first time that we are hearing about that,” she said. She also said her client would not be aware of any warrant that happened after he came to the US.“A warrant is not a conviction, a warrant is not a criminal entry, so I will leave it at that until I understand the specific facts of the case,” she said.Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security, said in a social media post that Culleton had overstayed his visa and failed to depart the US. “He received full due process and was issued a final order of removal by an immigration judge on September 10th 2025.” He was offered the choice to be instantly deported toIrelandbut instead “chose to stay in ICE custody”, she said, referencing his decision to contest his deportation.Culleton has said his whole life is in the US and disputes a claim by ICE agents that he signed a form consenting to deportation.Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US immigrationDrugsIrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

It is with profound sadness that we acknowledge that Robin took his own life.“As a family, together with Robin’s close friends, we can now begin to move forward and attempt, over time, to rebuild our lives.”The Latin and ballroom dancer joined the BBC programme in 2010 and danced with actors Patsy Kensit, Anita Dobson and Lisa Riley, along with Dragons’ Den entrepreneur Deborah Meaden, in four series until 2013.He could not perform in the 2014 series because of a back injury and was dropped in 2015 but still appeared in the Christmas special that year, dancing alongside TV presenter Alison Hammond.A written statement from Emmerdale actor Riley read to the inquest at west London coroner’s court said Windsor’s “glow had gone” after he was cut from the professional dancers’ lineup.She said: “It was from this moment, on to the time of his death, he kept slipping deeper and deeper into endless depression.“His glow had gone.”Addressing Windsor’s family in the courtroom, the coroner, Dr Anton van Dellen, said: “I hope you can think of the happy times he brought to the public and the deep affection the public held him in.”The dancer’s family thanked those who “marked [Windsor’s] life with such love”.“We wish to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who has shown us kindness, compassion and support throughout the long and difficult period since Robin’s passing,” their statement said.“Thank you to everyone who has remembered Robin and marked his life with such love.”A BBC spokesperson said: “Our sympathies are with Robin’s family, friends and all who knew him. The whole of the Strictly Come Dancing family remain deeply saddened by his passing. Robin was a much-loved member of the team – both on and off air – during his time on the show.“As the inquest has heard this week and the jury concluded, several complex factors contributed to how Robin felt at the time of his tragic death and our thoughts remain with all who knew and loved Robin.”Windsor, from Ipswich, had been an ambassador for mental health charity Sane.The Windsor family statement concluded: “If you or someone you care for is struggling with mental health, reaching out for support can really make a difference. You don’t have to face things alone.“Support is available via organisations like Sane and You Are Loved (a company that provides mental health support for LGBT+ people).”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

The move was described as a gift to “billionaire polluters” at the expense of Americans’ health.The endangerment finding, which states that the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere endangers public health and welfare, has since 2009 allowed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to limit heat-trapping pollution from vehicles, power plants and other industrial sources.Donald Trump called the move “the single largest deregulatory action in American history”.“This is a big one if you’re into environment,” he told reporters on Thursday. “This is about as big as it gets.”The move comes as part of Trump’s bigger anti-environment push, which has seen him roll back pollution rules and boost oil and gas.On social media, Barack Obamasaidthe repeal will leave Americans “less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change – all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money”.The former secretary of state John Kerry called the new rule “un-American”.“Repealing the Endangerment Finding takes Orwellian governance to new heights and invites enormous damage to people and property around the world,” said Kerry, who also served as Joe Biden’s climate envoy. “Ignoring warning signs will not stop the storm. It puts more Americans directly in its path.”The final rule removes the government’s ability to impose requirements to track, report and limit climate-heating pollution from cars and trucks. Transportation is the largest source of climate pollution in the US.View image in fullscreenEPA administrator Lee Zeldin speaks as Donald Trump looks on at the White House on Thursday.Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/ReutersIt does not apply to regulations on stationary sources of emissions such as power plants and fossil fuel infrastructure, which are regulated under a separate section of the Clean Air Act, but it will open the door to end those standards, too.Trump’s EPA hasseparately proposed to find that emissionsfrom power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution” and therefore should not be regulated. Joseph Goffman, who served as EPA air chief under Joe Biden, expects the agency will apply their vehicles-focused arguments to stationary polluters in order to kill the endangerment finding for all sources of greenhouse gas emissions.“Instead of the entire house of cards of all EPA climate regulation collapsing all at once today, it’s going to be like a row of dominoes falling,” said Goffman, who helped write and implement the Clean Air Act and worked directly on the endangerment finding.Environmental advocates have condemned the move as illegal. A slew of green groups have promised to take the EPA to court over the rollback, as has thestate of California.“If this reckless decision survives legal challenges, it will lead to more deadly wildfires, more extreme heat deaths, more climate-driven floods and droughts, and greater threats to communities nationwide – all while the EPA dismisses the overwhelming science that has protected public health for decades,” Gavin Newsom, the California governor, said in a statement.The move marks “the most aggressive, ruthless act of dismantling public health protections in the agency’s 55-year history”, said Dominique Browning, director and co-founder of environmental advocacy group Moms Clean Air Force.In apress release, the EPA said the movewill save the US$1.3tn, while Trump said Thursday that the move “will save American consumers trillions of dollars”.The EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, said the Obama and Biden administrations used the endangerment finding “to steamroll into existence a leftwing wish list of costly climate policies”.“Who paid the biggest price? Hardworking families, small businesses, millions of Americans who just want a reliable, affordable car to get to work or take their kids to school or go to church on Sunday,” he said.But though the rollback could save some corporations money, experts note it could take a massive toll on ordinary Americans’ wellbeing and pocketbooks.Oneanalysisfrom green group Environmental Defense Fund found the full repeal of the endangerment finding combined with Trump’s proposal to roll back motor vehicle standards would result in as much as 18bn more tons of planet-warming pollution by 2055 – the same as the annual emissions of China, the world’s top polluter – and wouldimpose up to $4.7tnin additional expenses tied to harmful climate and air pollution by that time.Zeldin submitted the repeal of the legal determination forWhite House review last month. In July, he officially announced plans torepeal the finding, justifying the proposal with a widely criticized energy department report questioning climate science.The agency received half a million comments on the proposal. Last month, a federal judgesaid the July energy department reportwas created unlawfully.In the repeal of the endangerment finding, the EPA is claiming that the Clean Air Act is only meant to regulate pollution “that harms health or the environment through local and regional exposure”. But there is scientific consensus that by trapping heat in the atmosphere, greenhouse gas emissions are intensifying dangerous extreme weather events, allowingdiseases to spread faster, and worsening illnesses from allergies tolung disease.Trump described the finding as “the legal foundation for the green new scam”, which he claimed “the Obama and Biden administration used to destroy countless jobs”.But the new rule will have ruinous consequences for working-class Americans, said Jason Walsh, executive director of BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental groups.“Billionaires like Donald Trump don’t suffer the devastation of climate change,” he said. “Working people do.”The rollback comes one month after theTrump administrationannounced it will pull the US from the foundational UN agreement to address the climate crisis, as well as the world’s leading body of climate scientists. Over the past year, Zeldin has also launched an all-out assault on climate, air, water and chemical protections. The EPA has also removed crucial climate-focused science and data from its webpages.“This is all part of the Trump administration’s authoritarian playbook to replace facts with propaganda, to enrich a few while harming the rest of us,” said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director for the climate and energy program at the science advocacy group the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Administrator Zeldin has fully abdicated EPA’s responsibility to protect our health and the environment.”The EPA has said that it determined the US would save billions annually by revoking the endangerment determination. But the agency’s analysis did not account for the money and lives saved by the environmental and public-health protections that the change would eliminate, experts say.Alex Witt, senior adviser at green advocacy group Climate Power, said: “Zeldin and Trump are telling our families: we’ll let you get sicker and watch your healthcare costs skyrocket as long as oil and gas CEOs can profit.”“This decision makes it abundantly clear that Trump is willing to make our families sicker and less safe, all to benefit a few billionaire polluters,” said Witt.Some industry groups have been reluctant to support the full rollback of the endangerment finding. TheAmerican Petroleum Institute, the top US oil lobby group, last month said it backed a repeal of the endangerment finding for vehicles, but not for stationary sources of pollution like power plants.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationClimate crisisUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This effect continued into their early 20s.Higher rates of academic pressure at school were also associated with greater mental ill health, the authors calculated.For every one-point increase in school stress, 24-year-olds were 16% more likely to say they had ever attempted suicide than those who experienced less academic pressure at 15.The senior author Gemma Lewis, a professor of psychiatric epidemiology at UCL, said: “Young people report that academic pressure is one of their biggest sources of stress.“A certain amount of pressure to succeed in school can be motivating, but too much pressure can be overwhelming and may be detrimental to mental health.”The report says that instead of focusing on ways to help pupils cope, schools should adopt whole-school initiatives to reduce exam stress, such as “interventions that enhance social and emotional learning and relaxation skills”.It suggests that reducing the number of high-stakes tests reduces academic stress, while families could “reduce academic pressure and encourage physical activity, socialising and sleep”.The findings underlineresearch by Young Mindslast year that found nearly two-thirds of 15- to 18-year-olds said they struggled to cope in the run-up to GCSE and A-levels. A quarter reported panic attacks, two-fifths said their mental health worsened and one in eight self-harmed or felt suicidal.Paul Noblet, the head of external affairs and research at Young Minds, said: “The evidence could not be clearer: academic pressures harm young people’s mental health.“The focus needs to shift from end-of-year exams and include a mix of assessment methods. How much longer must young people say they are struggling before truly meaningful changes are made?”Instagram CEO dismisses idea of social media addiction in landmark trialRead moreDr Sam Jones, a mental health officer at the Royal College of Paediatrics and ChildHealth, said the findings were symptomatic of wider pressures on children’s wellbeing.“We are seeing a sharp rise in mental health problems among children and young people,” he said. “More younger children are struggling and there has been an increase in self-harm and eating disorders in recent years.“What’s needed to improve young people’s wellbeing is national action to ensure equal, timely and appropriate access to both physical and mental health support, tackling child poverty, improving housing, increasing access to safe green spaces, reducing digital harms and reducing stress at school.”The children’s commissioner, Rachel de Souza, said her research showed that despite valuing their schools and teachers, one-third of children did not enjoy school.“I want to see an ambitious new system of supporting children’s needs in school that rebuilds trust with families, intervenes far earlier, and wraps specialist services and professionals around schools – not waiting for children to reach crisis point before help is available,” she said.A government spokesperson said: “This government is determined to see every child achieve and thrive, which means encouraging pupils to work hard while also helping them manage stress and build resilience.“Mental health support teams are already intervening early with children experiencing mild to moderate issues, and we’re expanding access to a mental health professional in every school, with an additional 900,000 pupils set to benefit this year.“This builds on our support-first approach for children facing barriers to attendance, while our landmark curriculum review will reduce overall exam time and strengthen pupils’ sense of belonging.”In the UK, the charityMindis available on 0300 123 3393 andChildlineon 0800 1111.

So did anybody really believe that Ukraine’s Vladyslav Heraskevych would lose his when the world’s eyes were upon him?Not the International Olympic Committee, who flipped between threats of expulsion and sweet talk over the past fortnight, without coming close to changing his mind. And certainly not those of us who have spoken and messaged Heraskevych, and found a manutterly prepared to sacrifice his dreamof winning a Winter Olympic medal for a higher purpose.‘It’s emptiness’: banned Ukrainian athlete accuses IOC of fuelling Russia’s propagandaRead moreIn public and private his message was the same: he would not back down. And if the IOC barred from competing in his “helmet of memory”, which commemorates some of the 600 Ukrainian athletes and coaches killed by Russian bombs and bullets since 2022, he would accept his fate.And when the moment came, shortly before 8.30am on Thursday, he met it with a powerful but resolute message:“This is price of our dignity,”alongside a photo of his helmet.For the IOC it must have been like watching a public relations car crash from the passenger seat. One that everyone knew was going to happen – and nothing could be done about it.Partly that was because Heraskevych’s messaging was so clever and precise. He didn’t focus on statements about Russian aggression. Instead hespoke powerfullyof wanting to honour his fallen friends. That allowed him to claim his message didn’t violate the IOC’s rules banning political expression on the field of play. Did everyone believe it? No. But it was a deft sidestep.Heraskevych also cut through with his claims that the IOC was inconsistent in its application of its rules over athlete expression. At the opening ceremony, for instance, his fellow skeleton racer, Israel’s Jared Firestone, wore a commemorative kippah to remember the 11 victims ofthe Munich massacre at the 1972 Games, which said: “We remember. We endure. We rise.”This week the US skater Maxim Naumov, wholost his parents in the Potomac air collisionlast year, honoured them by holding up a photograph in their memory after he competed. Why, Heraskevych pointed out, was his case any different?Finally, as he stated in his submission to the court of arbitration for sport in an attempt to overturn his ban on Thursday evening, was the IOC’s decision really proportionate?View image in fullscreenUkraine’s Vladyslav Heraskevych, with his helmet, which features pictures of people killed in the war with Russia.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAAll that said, the IOC did try avert one of the most controversial moments of recent Olympics. Its president, Kirsty Coventry, went to Cortina in a last-ditch attempt to break the impasse. The fact that she did so, and was in tears afterwards, said a lot about her compassion and leadership style.However, allowing Heraskevychto use his helmet in practiceand letting him wear a black armband in competition was never going to be enough to change his mind.This is not the IOC of her predecessor, Thomas Bach, who seemed to only smile in public when votes were needed at elections.And this is certainly not the IOC of a generation or two ago. When Tommie Smith and John Carlos were kicked out for theirblack power salute at the 1968 Olympicsit came at the urging of the then IOC president Avery Brundage – a man who repeatedly defended Nazi Germany before and after the 1936 Games when president of the US Olympic Committee.Brundage was at it again in 1972 in Munich when the American 400m athletes Vincent Matthews and Wayne Collettwere given a lifetime banfrom the Olympics after turning their backs to the US flag on the podium. “A disgusting display,” he called it.View image in fullscreenThe International Olympic Committee president, Kirsty Coventry, tries to explain the decision to disqualify Heraskevych to the media.Photograph: Kirsty Coventry/APSo times have changed. But the problem the IOC has is that it clings to the old lie that sport and politics can be separated. Remember that it was only last week that the IOC – along with Fifa –was making noises about bringing Russia backinto the sporting fold.This is the same Russia that tried to hack the Milano Cortina website before these Games. Thatlaunched a sophisticated cyber-attackat the Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Pyeongchang. And, most famously of all, corrupted the 2014 Winter Games in Sochiby doping its athletes– with a scheme that involved using a mousehole to swap steroid-riddled urine samples with clean ones.Russia has, according to Ukraine, also destroyed more than 800 sports facilities, including over 20 Olympic, Paralympic and Deaflympic training centres.I am not convinced the IOC was doing Russia’s propaganda for them, as Heraskevych and the Global Athlete organisation has claimed. But it was certainly a terrible look to ban an athlete for wanting to pay homage to his friends, while his country is being hit with ballistic missiles and you have recently made cooing noises to Russia.The question is, could the IOC have done anything differently? Perhaps. But the stumbling block was always going to be that it saw Heraskevych’s helmet – rightly or wrongly – as violating one of its core tenets: that the field of play must be entirely neutral and free of political and social protest.Team GB’s Matt Weston leads golden charge as skeleton rivals unite behind banned UkrainianRead moreAs one insider put it to me, if the “helmet of memory” had been approved, the IOC could have potentially opened up Pandora’s box and set a precedent. Could you imagine the furore if the Iranian government forced its athletes to mourn the head of the revolutionary guard, say, after he was assassinated?But perhaps there was a way. After all, if the IOC was able to set up an independent panel to decide whether Russians could compete as Authorised Neutral Athletes, why could they not have done the same for Heraskevych and other such cases? And maybe the IOC could have even looked the other way, and allowed him to compete. It would have made a ripple, for sure. But a day later we would have been on to the nextski jumping penisgateorbiathlete cheating on his girlfriendstory. That’s how fast the Olympics news cycle moves.But there is one thing we can say for certain: Heraskevych has got the horrors of the war in Ukraine back on the agenda, which was his aim all along.The Russian team will be back at the Winter Paralympics later this month. And last week there were suggestions that the Olympic team would be reinstated this year. The latter decision has surely been pushed back now.So while Heraskevych has lost his battle to compete – at least until Cas rules – he has taken a stand that will live long in the memory, and certainly won the public relations war.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsInternational Olympic CommitteeUkraineSport politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

It is one of the first times that we can say that government measures have not just worked, but have really improved things,” said Sébastien Brosse, of the University of Toulouse in France.Brosse was part of a research team that analysed the changes in the vast waterway, which serves a population of 400 million people and many of the world’s largest factories. After the ban, the team observed fish biomass had more than doubled and several endangered species had rebounded.Their results, which werepublished on Thursday in the journal Science, raise hopes of a remarkable – if still fragile – comeback.The world’s third largest river, stretching nearly 4,000 miles from glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau to its estuary near Shanghai, was the site of one of the world’s most shocking extinction events earlier this century with thedemiseof the baiji, a freshwater dolphin that was once worshipped as a goddess but was wiped out by pollution, dams, traffic and reckless fishing with electricity and dynamite.View image in fullscreenObserved numbers of the Yangtze finless porpoise increased from 400 to 600.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesChinese scientists had long called for a fishing ban on the Yangtze to halt the degradation of habitats and prevent a further decline in fish stocks, which had fallen by 85%, but government restrictions were piecemeal until 2021, when a 10-year ban was put in place by the central government.It was designed according to theprinciplesof evolutionary game theory, to assess how the three main bodies affected – communities, local governments and central government – would behave depending on different applications of punishments and rewards.The government spent about $3bn on compensating and finding alternative employment for about 200,000 fishers, scrapping many of the 100,000 boats involved.The rapid improvement noted in the study, which compared data from the two years before (2019-2021) with the two years after (2021-23), included a twofold increase in overall biomass and a 13% improvement in diversity. One of the most endangered species, the Yangtze finless porpoise, appeared to have been a major beneficiary with observed numbers rising from 400 to 600, according to Brosse.View image in fullscreenThe baiji dolphin was driven to extinction by pollution, dams, traffic and reckless fishing in the Yantze.Photograph: Stephen Leatherwood/PAThe leader of the study,Fangyuan Xiong of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was upbeat about the findings: “The results reported in this study … provide hope that in an era of global biodiversity decline, ambitious political decisions that support large-scale restoration efforts can help reverse the ecosystem damages of the past and lead to a brighter future.”Brosse echoed this and urged authorities governing other major waterways in the world –almost all of whichare suffering alarming deterioration – to learn from the Yangtze’s example. He said it could be of great use in the management of the Mekong River, which ihas similar problems.But the authors of the paper and other biologists emphasise the Yangtze and its wildlife remain highly vulnerable to human pressures, which means the authorities must continue to strengthen conservation and enforcement measures.Illegal fishing, particularly in the Gan tributary of the Yangtze, remains a constant threat and requires heightened policing by local authorities. Water quality needs to be improved and some species, such as the critically endangered Chinese sturgeon, need access around giant hydropower plants on the Yangtze to reach spawning grounds.Overall, however, this looks likely to be taken as evidence that the Chinese government’s efforts to address ecological threats have started to show positive results, after decades of neglect and decline.Explore more on these topicsRiversChinaFishFishingWildlifeWaterEndangered speciesnewsShareReuse this content"

Whereas on this stage, six men send up Bausch’s choreography and signature style, skewering its cliches. Not that everyone in the audience will know the reference. If you’re not a regular dance-goer, you may just see a bunch of men in long flowing gowns processing around the stage and flinging their long wigs about. But still entertaining.A lot of Tutu, after all, is just about raising mirth through silly dancing and silly costumes. All-male comedy dance company Chicos Mambo, directed by French choreographer Philippe Lafeuille, have been performing this show for more than a decade, and it seems to be a camp crowd-pleaser. Certainly the costumes are fun: puffy, flamingo-coloured tutu trousers, like a cross between a powder puff and a frilly toilet roll cover; hats that look like vegetables (Why? Why not!).Much like that other all-male troupe the Trocks, a lot of the material comes from a gently mocking but deep love of dance. Swan Lake’s cygnets become daffy ducks in dumpy costumes, putting a bit of disco into Tchaikovsky. You’ve got some Sleeping Beauty, some earnest Euro-contemporary dance soundtracked by the dancers’ breath (bad breath, it turns out, that’s the joke). There’s a Dirty Dancing skit, complete with Swayze’s swivel hips, a ticklish armpit and, yes, the lift.View image in fullscreenCurious surprises … Chicos Mambo: Tutu at Sadler’s Wells East.Photograph: Sandro OliveiraThere are a few curious surprises too. Tutu is a study in contrasts – Bach’s Goldberg Variations mixed with the haka, for example. The dancers rinse a few laughs out of men hobbling on pointe shoes, but then Vincenzo Veneruso dances a rather beautiful solo, on pointe. There’s a scene with the six men as babies in nappies, tottering, nose-picking and bum-shuffling to the fierce, slicing chords of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring. (Because it’s a kind of fertility ritual? Or just because it’s the most random, unlikely thing you could set to that legendary music?)It’s amusingly done, clever in parts, nonsense in others; it’s tightly choreographed larking about. But you do find yourself asking, is there more to this joke? Then again, a few rows ahead, a child of maybe seven or eight (who I’m assuming has never heard of Pina Bausch) is in absolute hysterics from start to finish.AtSadler’s Wells East, London, until 15 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsDanceTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Sadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

There are some through-lines in his work – a dark sense of humour, an ease with pushing megastars past their limits – but he was mostly there in service of something or someone else, whether it be IP or an A-lister.Crime 101 review – bracing tale of master thief lifts a trick or two from Michael MannRead moreAfter both consumed him in 2013’s loathed flop The Lone Ranger, Verbinski went away and returned three years later with an extravagant “one for me”, the ambitious throwback horror A Cure for Wellness. I ultimately admired what he was trying to do (a gothic, exquisitely crafted original chiller with a real budget) more than what he actually achieved, and with another box-office disappointment under his belt, he disappeared again. A longer wait of almost a decade followed, and now he’s back with an even bigger swing, the sci-fi comedy adventure Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die.The swing was, in fact, so big that it was made independently and then picked up by Briarcliff, a company mostly known for buying films others won’t touch, whether that be down to content (Trump drama The Apprentice), off-screen controversy (Jonathan Majors’ vehicle Magazine Dreams) or quality (Benedict Cumberbatch dud The Thing With Feathers). It’s not that the film doesn’t have commercial elements – big action set pieces, a recognisable cast, what appears to be a decent budget – it’s just packaged in a way that makes it more of an outlier in 2026, in ways that both work and don’t. Like A Cure for Wellness, it’s a thing of specific personality and impressive craft, but like that film it’s also cursed with an ungainly length (134 minutes to A Cure’s 147) and a frustrating lack of restraint.It’s a definite step up, though, a more complete idea of the kind of film Verbinski would be making if the industry truly let him (the past few years have seen him try, and so far fail, to get a number of projects off the ground, including animated adventure Cattywampus and a George RR Martin adaptation). It starts with an unoriginal yet immediately involving attention-grabber: a man walks into a diner claiming he’s from the future. The man is played by a manicSam Rockwell, and he warns of a future where smartphone dependency has led to societal collapse and artificial intelligence has gained full control. He needs volunteers to help him track down the source and steer it in a better direction, a quest he’s tried multiple times before without success, but, with the future of humanity on his shoulders, one he must keep trying and trying again.It’s the old Terminator 2 setup updated with elements of Black Mirror, The Mitchells vs the Machines, The Matrix, Wall-E and, shudder, Y2K with a dash of Everything Everywhere’s gonzo maximalism (for a film positioning itself as a wild new vision, it’s all rather familiar). It’s a lot and it’ssupposedto be – flashbacks, flashforwards, just general flashes – but it’s surprising how much actually sticks, given how nauseating the very worst version of this cocktail could have been. That’s partly because of the film’s timely hatred of all things AI (Verbinski’s press tour has also beenpleasingly sourtowards it) and how it uses the corrosive consequences of living our lives out on a phone screen as the lead-in to an apocalyptic nightmare, all awfully relatable at this particularly awful moment. Once Rockwell’s leader picks his ensemble (including Juno Temple, Zazie Beetz, Haley Lu Richardson and Michael Peña), screenwriter Matthew Robinson gives the prominent characters each a vignette to show how tech had been negatively affecting them, from a teacher struggling with a classroom of TikTok addicts to a mother transferring her dead son’s consciousness into a clone. They all take us to far more interesting places than the more run-of-the-mill quest we keep returning to.The jumping around can leave us a little too dizzy, especially when added to the madcap, anything-goes rules of the enemy, which brings forth pig-masked goons, toys brought to life and, most unsuccessfully, a human-eating giant cat creature. The up-to-11 excess, when megaphoned to us at such a hefty run time (one feels like a limited series could have worked better), can take away from the smaller, smarter observations and more human moments that work better, the sadness of what tech has already taken away and the fear over what else is to come. Rockwell, whose performances sometimes need a reining-in that isn’t always on show elsewhere here, manages to keep things just about on the right side, more energised than annoying, while, as is often the case, Richardson is a standout, adding texture to her frowny tech-allergic purist who might be the key to everything.Even if much of Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die is in need of a rethink, it’s hard not to enjoy the scrappy, animated brainstorm taking place in front of us. The mess of it all is at least a very human one.Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die is out in the US and Australia on 13 February and in the UK on 20 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsSam RockwellJuno TempleScience fiction and fantasy filmsComedy filmsAction and adventure filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

As the fresh-faced Dawson Leery in the American dramaDawson’s Creek(1998-2003) – shown in the UK on Channel 4 andthen on Channel 5– he starred in a series portraying friendship, first love and the trials and tribulations of adolescence in the fictional coastal town of Capeside, Massachusetts.The nerdy Dawson’s idealism and habit of over-analysing often give him unrealistic expectations and a tendency to make long emotional speeches. “It’s not about the kiss – it’s about the journey and creating a sustaining magic,” he reflects in an early episode.With the ambition to be a film director, Dawson has posters from Steven Spielberg’s blockbusters on his bedroom wall and sees life in terms of movie moments.Van Der Beek was 20 and studying at college in New Jersey when he landed the role of the 15-year-old high-school student.“My concern was basically getting my school work done and commuting three hours to do a show eight times a week,” he said, after making the first series in North Carolina. “In that respect, I really kind of identify with Dawson, that he is very driven, almost to the point of – not obsession, but just really occupied with his passion.”Dawson’s Creek was created by Kevin Williamson, who previously wrote the filmsScream(1996) andI Know What You Did Last Summer(1997), both also focusing on groups of young friends. When Williamson auditioned Van Der Beek, he recognised in him “that nervousness that made it seem like he was pre-thinking and over-thinking and over-compensating constantly like he was insecure” – and he cast him as Dawson.The programme followed its characters from adolescence to adulthood and brought worldwide fame to Van Der Beek, as well as to Katie Holmes, who played the headstrong Joey Potter, Dawson’s childhood best friend and later his girlfriend, Michelle Williams as Jen Lindley, his next-door neighbour and first date, and Joshua Jackson, as his sarcastic mate Pacey Witter.Gaining heart-throb status, Van Der Beek needed police escorts and was once asked to leave a shopping mall when he was besieged by teenage girls. “You cease to be a human being,” he said. “It’s as if you’re a novelty item.”But fame also catapulted him to starring roles in films, including as a rebellious high-school football player in the coming-of-age dramaVarsity Blues(1999) and as Sean Bateman, a promiscuous, drug-dealing student in Roger Avary’sThe Rules of Attraction(2002), adapted from the Bret Easton Ellis novel. He even played himself, an actor in a Hollywood studio’s dressing room, in the comedy Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001), directed by Kevin Smith.James was born in Cheshire,Connecticut, to Melinda (nee Weber), a dancer and gymnastics studio manager, and James Van Der Beek, a mobile phone company executive. He went to the college-prep school Cheshire academy.At the age of 13, during a school football match, Van Der Beek suffered concussion. Ordered to take a year’s break from the game, he turned his interest to drama and landed the leading role of Danny Zuko in a school production of Grease. “I fell in love with the theatre,” he said. “I did go back and play a little football, but it basically got to the point where I was doing more acting than anything else.”After signing with an agent in New York, he made his professional stage debut off-Broadway with the Signature Theatre Company, as Fergus inEdward Albee’s one-act play Finding the Sun (1994);“James Van Der Beek is refreshingly un-self-conscious,”wrote a New York Times critic.He also appeared in the musical Shenandoah at the Goodspeed Opera House, Connecticut, in 1994, before making his film debut as a high-school bully, alongsideGeorge C ScottandKathy Bates, in Angus (1995).View image in fullscreenJames Van Der Beek, second left, in a 2002 episode of Dawson’s Creek, with from left: Katie Holmes, Michelle Williams and Joshua Jackson.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyThen, he enrolled to study English at Drew University, New Jersey, and while there had a small role in the film I Love You, I Love You Not (1996), starringClaire Danes. On stage, he played a disturbed teenager in the off-Broadway comedy My Marriage to Ernest Borgnine (1997). After landing his breakthrough role in Dawson’s Creek, he eventually dropped out of university.Van Der Beek’s later TV roles included an aspiring rock star, with a deliberately over-exaggerated Canadian accent and wearing a fat suit, in 2008 and 2013 episodes of the sitcomHow I Met Your Mother; doctors in Mercy (2010) and Friends with Better Lives (2014); a fictionalised version of himself in Don’t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23 (2012-13); an FBI field agent in CSI: Cyber (2015-16); and the vengeful Matt Bromley, revealing a workmate’s affair, in the first series of Pose (2018).He also created and starred in What Would Diplo Do? (2017), a TV mockumentary based on the American DJ and record label ownerWesley “Diplo” Penzt.Fiona Sturges wrote in the Guardianthat the programme, featuring a character with “the life skills of a toddler”, was “somewhere between Spinal Tap and The Office”, adding: “Crucial to its success is Van Der Beek, who captures the swagger and the bubbling madness that comes with wealth and celebrity, while somehow locating a thread of humanity.”For his starring role as an FBI agent in the film Formosa Betrayed (2009), Van Der Beek won the best actor award at the San Diego film festival.He was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2023,announcing his illness the following year. Last year, a Dawson’s Creek cast reunion took place at the Richard Rodgers theatre, New York, for a one-night charity event. Unable to attend, he sent a video message of thanks to fans and his fellow stars.Van Der Beek married the actor Heather McComb in 2003; they divorced seven years later. He is survived by his second wife, Kimberly (nee Brook), whom he married in 2010, and their six children, Olivia, Joshua, Annabel, Emilia, Gwendolyn and Jeremiah.James David Van Der Beek, actor, born 8 March 1977; died 11 February 2026Explore more on these topicsTelevisionUS televisionConnecticutChannel 4TheatreobituariesShareReuse this content"

This smartly wrought and tightly packed production clings to the moments before Russia’s full-scale invasion of the Donbas in 2022, as Braga conjures a bleak microcosm of war in a cramped Ukrainian home.Every element of this sometimes overloaded show works hard, with already high tensions within the household increasing as the external threat of Russian occupation creeps closer. Director Anthony Simpson-Pike makes ambitious use of the small stage in his first show as artistic director, while Niall McKeever’s set feigns simplicity only to rip itself impressively apart when invasion strikes.Dreams are already shattered when we meet our cast. Jack Bandeira stalks the stage as Sashko, a young man with hungry eyes recently released from a Russian jail. Desperate not to give an inch to the invaders, he clashes with his coiled father Seryoga (Philippe Spall), who is willing to stick to Russian rules if it means getting to live. In a play of machismo and squared shoulders – which on occasion devolve into shouting matches – the finest moments are those of small tendernesses. When Sashko asks his father’s Moldovan girlfriend Marianca (played with appeasing warmth by Sasha Syzonenko) to teach him how to correctly pronounce her name, their shoulders sink into each other in a rare moment of intimacy.View image in fullscreenAppeasing warmth … Sasha Syzonenko (right) and Jack Bandeira in Donbas at Theatre503, London.Photograph: Helen MurrayHeritage matters in this house. They speak of “pure-blood” Ukrainians, of neighbours not being welcome because of where they were born, rather than where they have always lived (a jolly Steve Watts and a flirtatious Liz Kettle give a too-brief and much-needed reprieve as kindly neighbours). The play’s urgency is slowed by Sashko’s folkloric stories to calm a neighbour’s silent, watchful granddaughter, while nearby, a gun is trained on the family’s street as Bandeira and Spall double up as soldiers keeping watch in an abandoned house. These secondary characters expand the scope of the play but also stretch its heart; they are somewhat thinly drawn to pack in all the action, with not enough time given to feel individual agony.In Sashko’s stories, he explains what it means to have a good death rather than a wasted one. By depicting the random ugliness of war, Donbas reminds us that this meagre hope is just another story we tell ourselves to get by.AtTheatre503, London, until 28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreUkraineEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, many scholars are asking: how did the Maya survive?ByMarcus HaraldssonThu 12 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 12 Feb 2026 11.57 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleAs a seven-year-old, Francisco Estrada-Belli was afraid all of history would have been discovered by the time he was old enough to contribute. The year was 1970 and he and his parents had come from Rome to visit relatives in the Central American country ofGuatemala. On the trip, they visited the ancient Maya ruins at Tikal. “I was completely mesmerised,” Estrada-Belli told me recently. “It was jungle everywhere, there were animals, and then these enormous, majestic temples. I asked questions but felt the answers were not good enough. I decided there and then that I wanted to be answering them.”Fifty-five years later, Estrada-Belli is now one of the archaeologists helping to rewrite the history of the Maya peoples who built Tikal. Thanks to technological advances, we are entering anew age of discoveryin the field of ancient history. Improved DNA analysis, advances in plant and climate science, soil and isotope chemistry, linguistics and other techniques such as a laser mapping technology called Lidar, are overturning long-held beliefs. Nowhere is this more true than when it comes to Maya archaeology.Last year, Estrada-Belli’s team, including his Tulane University colleague Marcello A Canuto,published a studywith a central finding that would have seemed, just a few years ago, like an outrageously speculative overestimate. When Estrada-Belli first came to Tikal as a child, the best estimate for the classic-era (AD600-900) population of the surrounding Maya lowlands – encompassing present day southern Mexico, Belize and northern Guatemala – would have been about 2 million people. Today, his team believes that theregionwas home to up to 16 million. That is more than five times the area’s current population. This would mean that more people lived in the classic-era Maya lowlands than on the Italian peninsula during the peak of the Roman empire – all crammed into an area a third of the size.A comparison between the classic Maya and ancient Rome is instructive in other ways. Some Maya cities were established hundreds of years before the founding of Rome, and they included significantly larger architecture that still stands. Both cultures developed sophisticated astronomy, mathematics, writing and agriculture, as well as elaborate trade arrangements across vast cosmopolitan lands. The ruins of Rome are today covered by a bustling world city where some of the most prominent elite families claim to trace their ancestry directly to ancient times. Many Maya ruins, in contrast, are now covered by more than 1,000 years’ worth of tropical forest while the descendants of the peoples who built those cities are some of the poorest people on Earth.According to census records, the various Maya and much smaller Indigenous groups, such as Xinka and Garifuna, today account for more than 11 million people across Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras and the US. Most of them, 7.7 million, live in Guatemala, where they officially comprise 44% of the population. (Human rights organisations believe the number may be higher as it has long been stigmatised, even dangerous, to identify as Maya.)History – both ancient and recent – is a key political issue for the Maya. In Guatemala, they have two central demands: first, that there be a full reckoning with the civil war and genocide that lasted from 1960 to 1996, and claimed about 200,000 lives, most of them Maya. Second, that they are recognised as the original inhabitants and legitimate owners of this land. As they see it, half a millennium of prejudice and discrimination against their community has led to a situation where, among other issues, two-thirds of the country’s arable land is controlled by only 2.5% of its farmers, few of them Maya, while 60% of Indigenous children are undernourished.In 2023, the Maya peoples played a key role in the unlikely presidential election victory of a former diplomat named Bernardo Arévalo. The campaign to protect the vote against a corrupt judiciary was led by Indigenous groups and included 106 days of nationwide protests. Although Arévalo is not himself Maya, he is sympathetic to their cause. One of the people he appointed to his government is Liwy Grazioso, another prominent archaeologist with Italian roots, who now serves as minister of culture and sports. Grazioso is an expert in Maya history, and has published papers on the tombs of Rio Azul and the metropolis of Tikal, and overseen research on Kaminaljuyu, the ancient Maya city that rests under the capital. As a politician, she aims to build a country where the past and present can coexist, and where the country’s original inhabitants are a fully recognised part of the national story. “It’s not that the Maya are better, or that their ancient society was somehow superior to ours, but because as humans they are the same,” she said while offering me a glass of unsweetened hibiscus tea.We were sitting in a grand, wood-panelled office, on the third floor of El Guacamolón, a mighty palace colloquially named after the colour of a mashed avocado dish, in the centre of Guatemala City. Since the palace’s completion in 1943, these bombastic halls have accommodated half a dozen military coups, as well as the planned annihilation of the lives, cultures, languages and history of the Maya. This oppression, of course, has a long history. Grazioso explained how Maya elites – intellectuals, royals, astronomers, priests, writers and historians – were systematically killed by the Spanish colonisers, and their texts burned as works of the devil.View image in fullscreenA street trader outside the National Palace (El Guacamolón) in Guatemala City.Photograph: Marcus HaraldssonOutsiders’ power over the story of the Maya is written into the people’s very name. After their arrival in the early 1500s, the Spanish named local populations “Maya” after the ruined city of Mayapán in present day Mexico. Yet the Maya never saw themselves as one people and were never governed under one empire. They spoke many languages – 30 of which are still around – and belong to an intricate mix of cultures and identities.By the time the field of Maya archaeology began in the 19th century, most of the knowledge once held by local leaders was gone. Over time, some observers spread pseudoscientific stories claiming that Maya temples were more likely to have been built by aliens than by ancestors of local people. (Vikings, Mormon Nephites and other mysteriously vanished civilisations have also been dubiously credited with building the ancient sites.) Grazioso believes that these fantastical theories serve a political purpose. “If we deprive the actual Maya of their glorious past, we don’t need to give them power today,” she said. “Talking about collapse and aliens becomes a distraction from what is right in front of us.”That is where the work of present-day archaeologists comes in. Until recently, the prevailing debate about the Maya centred around the question of why their civilisation collapsed. While scholars continue to study this question, an increasing number of archaeologists are now also asking: how did the Maya survive? The question addresses both their ancient – and modern – abilities to transform extremely challenging circumstances into enduring survival.For a long time, the idea that complex human settlements could once have existed in the Maya lowlands was seen as impossible. The theory was based on research in the Amazon rainforest in the 1950s and known as “the law of environmental limitation”. It held that lowland rainforests, with their thin soils, were not suitable for large advanced societies, as they could only produce limited amounts of food. This kind of land could only support small, primitive tribes. For many years, the idea was considered the closest thing to a natural law in anthropology.When the theory was formulated, no large settlements had yet been discovered in the Amazon, but the Maya lowlands held thousands of massive stone pyramids, countless temples, raised causeways, engraved stone monuments and intricate tombs where buried royals were clad in luscious jade jewellery. Rather than positing the existence of highly populated, sophisticated Maya lowland cultures, many researcherstried to squarewhat they found on the ground with the perceived law of environmental limitations. According to the “segmentary state” model, Maya kings ruled symbolically over a few disconnected communities living in tiny settlements separated by forest.The law of environmental limitation was largely overturned in the 1980s, as the deciphering of Maya hieroglyphs allowed researchers to read the texts on large stone monuments, known as stelae, in city centres. The carvings had been believed to be astronomical or ceremonial but turned out to be historical. And the stories they told were not of primitive forest dwellers, but of kings and conquerors, queens and revolutions.View image in fullscreenYaxhá in Guatemala’s Petén Basin.Photograph: Marcus HaraldssonIn recent years a new story has formed, partly thanks to Lidar technology. Short for “light detection and ranging”, it consists here of bulky laser machines attached to twin engine aircrafts that fly half a kilometre above forests and fields. The equipment produces contour scans of the ground, making it possible to identify straight, round, or squared features, such as ancient ruins, fields, roads, temples, dams and fortifications. Lidar isn’t new – it has mapped the moon and is today a key feature in many technologies, including self-driving cars – but it made the leap into archaeology in 2009 after researchers at the classic Maya city of Caracol in Belize saw biologists using it to measure forest growth. With some tweaking, they thought, it could also map the ground beneath rainforest canopies.In 2016, when Francisco Estrada-Belli saw Lidar scans of Holmul in north-eastern Guatemala, he realised that “archaeology had changed for ever, there was no going back”. He explained to me how he had laboured for 16 years to map this major city, using measuring tape and the help of countless assistants. They waded through thick jungle to reconstruct what the city might have looked like throughout its 1,700 years of history. His teams had outlined about 1,000 structures. Now, he could compare this with Lidar findings. During just three days of scanning, it had mapped more than 7,000 structures: residential buildings, canals, terraces, field enclosures, causeways and defence walls. Lidar had produced a continuous scan of an area 10 times larger than his teams had managed on foot.Subsequent large-scale mappings led to Estrada-Belli’s estimate that between 9.5 and 16 million people once lived in the Maya lowlands. He calls the lowlands in the 700s a “continuously interconnected rural-urban sprawl”. This was a cosmopolitan region with high degrees of trade and settlements interconnected by a close web of causeways and roads. The ancient Maya did not use pack animals, or carriage wheels. Everything that was built and traded had to be carried by human force alone. Shoes had to be repaired, and people had to sleep and eat – not by distances of a day’s ride by horse, as in Eurasia, but within walking distance. There was no wilderness in these lowlands, Estrada-Belli told me, but rather a low density scattering of people, businesses and agricultural fields, and managed wetlands and forests – everywhere. Interspersed with all this were larger buildings, presumably for members of the elite.This urban sprawl landscape opens a new set of questions. The most important of these, according to Estrada-Belli, has to do with agriculture. “When looking at Central American forests today, we must reckon with the fact that ancient humans affected everything,” he said. “The tree species are there because the Maya chose them, the types of flowers are around because they made use of them, the wetlands served a human function. And so on. And all these methods were sustainable over thousands of years.” He described “the enormous investments the Maya put into canals, terraces and raised fields in water. They used extremely diverse, advanced and flexible farming methods, rotating and combining hundreds of species.”Yet today humans use the land “for cattle farming and monocultural corn plantations that does nothing but destroy the land,” he said. “We have a lot to learn.”Tikal is the most visited of Guatemala’s Maya sites, welcoming hundreds of thousands of tourists every year. The surrounding woodlands belong to the Maya Biosphere Reserve, part of the largest tropical forest in theAmericasoutside the Amazon. It is easy to be seduced by the sense of mysticism here. At dawn, visitors sit in darkness on top of a 70-metre-tall temple hearing howler monkeys bawl in concert with thousands of crickets. The rising sun gradually reveals a seemingly endless tropical canopy interspersed only by the summits of other ancient pyramids. Only a tiny part ofTikal has been cleared of vegetation and restored to something vaguely resembling its former glory. The rest remains covered by thick layers of soil and trees.The most recently inscribed stela found at Tikal was dated in AD869. Researchers’ interpretation of what happened after that date has over the past few decades transformed from a “sudden and disastrous” collapse into a historical era referred to as the Terminal Classic. The term encompasses a 200-year period when city centres were abandoned and farmers gradually moved to lands to the north and south. As Tikal and dozens of other cities were abandoned, places such as Chichén Itzá, Uxmal and Mayapán further north on the Yucatan peninsula grew rapidly, as did settlements in the highlands to the south. It appears as if many people during classic Maya times chose to migrate, rather than simply waiting around as things fell apart around them.View image in fullscreenThe Tikal archeological site.Photograph: Marcus Haraldsson“We don’t really talk of collapse any more, but about decline, transformation and reorganisation of society and continuation of the culture,” said Kenneth E Seligson, an associate professor of archaeology at California State University. “Several similar shifts have happened in other places, such as Rome,” said Seligson. But “we rarely talk of the great Roman collapse any more, because they came back in various forms, just like the Maya”.Seligson is one of many researchers seeking to shift attention from the Maya collapse to focus on their long-term survival. When its last stela was engraved, the city of Tikal could look back at more than 1,500 years of development. At the height of Tikal’s power in the 700s, it housed between 40,000 and 80,000 inhabitants, or even more, depending on where the city limits are drawn. This made it one of the world’s largest urban areas of the period. Yet the city looked nothing like the metropolitan expanses we are used to today. There was no grid of streets and fields for agriculture reached far into the city centre.Living here required inventiveness. Most of Seligson’s research has focused on limestone, the bedrock under the Maya lowlands, covered only by a thin layer of soil. Limestone provides poor nutrition for most forms of farming, and allows any rainfall to quickly disappear into cracks that lead deep underground. On top of these challenges, for half the year, there is little rain. Yet Tikal and many other cities thrived. Inhabitants cultivated chocolate, vanilla, avocados, tomatoes, yuca, sweet potatoes and hundreds of other crops. Limestone was used to preserve food and purify water. It was used to make soap and for medicinal purposes. Houses were built of lime cement strengthened with sand and grass. Lime was even burnt and mixed with maize to help the Maya absorb nutrients. “The Maya should really be known as a people of immense resilience. They worked with available resources to develop long-term highly flexible solutions,” said Seligson.The eventual decline of Maya lowland cities is still a hotly debated matter. Estrada-Belli believes it could have been the result of shifting trade routes. Others – including geographer Jared Diamond in his influential but controversial book Collapse – attribute the supposed downfall to greed among the Maya elites leading to a human-made ecological disaster. Another much-discussed theory,based on analysisof sediments from lakes and caves, is climate change. Some argue that a centuries-long “megadrought” was theultimate causefor the decline of the classic Maya. Seligson, who recently wrote a book about the Maya and climate change, is not so sure. “Climate was undoubtedly an important factor,” he said, but it was one among many.View image in fullscreenLiwy Grazioso in her office in the National Palace.Photograph: Marcus HaraldssonTrue to her role as a government minister, Liwy Grazioso believes one key explanation was declining trust in leadership. In arecent scientific articleabout the rise and fall of Tikal, she and her co-authors list factors including economic competition, increased warfare, lack of arable land and failure of revenue streams, as well as depletion of soil quality and droughts. All these strains on society made it hard to maintain essential infrastructure such as reservoirs. When I met Grazioso in the National Palace, she compared the flamboyant government building where we met to the great pyramids of Tikal. “This is a public building and it’s very beautiful. But to keep it, you need to use government money. When a crisis or a war is coming, who’s going to care? If the palace crumbles, who will pay attention? You will try to provide food for your family.”Sitting in the current seat of power, Grazioso turned the argument to the present. She said: “It is the same that happens now, if we are not careful. Governments need to earn the trust of their taxpayers.”Sonia Gutiérrez is a lawyer of the Poqomam Maya people from the highlands south-west of the capital. As the only Indigenous woman among the 160 seats in the Guatemalan parliament, she is arguably the highest-ranking Maya in the country. “Our political system has never represented the reality of our nation,” she said to me in her office a few blocks south of the National Palace.Gutiérrez is the current leader of the Winaq party, founded by Rigoberta Menchú who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992 for her efforts to end Guatemala’s civil war and achieve post-conflict reconciliation. “Our telling of history needs to change, and our society needs to change,” said Gutiérrez. “Our vision goes back to the time before colonialism. We must be seen not as alien people, but as living in our country where our ancestors used to live.”View image in fullscreenSonia Gutiérrez: ‘Our telling of history needs to change.’Photograph: Marcus Haraldsson“I have three struggles,” she said. “I am a woman, I am Indigenous and I am on the democratic left. I am working against all of history for the vindication of our historic cause.” She spoke of the need for a “plurinational” state that recognised the rights of self-governance among diverse groups. (Something similarhas been implemented, with complications and backlash, into the constitutions of Bolivia and Ecuador.)She talked abouttzilaj k’aslemal, the good life – a Maya concept she wants to see incorporated into the nation’s constitution. This would involve an approach to health in which modern medicine is “complemented with ancestral knowledge”, an education system that teaches Indigenous languages, and a different approach to the natural world. “We question the foundational capitalistic model,” said Gutiérrez. “For us, natural resources are not only to be exploited, but part of our existence, where we must take care of our rivers, our mountains, our forests. It is a vision of a plural society built on culture.”And how could that be built? “It will take a long time,” she admitted. Still, she said, there is an urgency to what she’s doing. “The president and his administration give us a window of possibility. But I’m afraid that the old power structures have penetrated the state so much that the government is having a very hard time. And there is a lot of risk.”Risk?“Yes, if we do not act on this chance, there will not be another opportunity. And the revenge could be as severe as it was last time. We are up against well organised resistance to the ideas I am talking about.” Her conclusion was matter of fact: “We could see another civil war.”Afew kilometres north of the government offices, remains from the civil war are still processed at the laboratories of the Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Foundation (FAFG). Several of its staff were educated at the same institutions as Liwy Grazioso, and the technical advances that have transformed ancient archaeology are here employed to uncover modern Maya history: FAFG digs up and identifies victims of massacres.First, witness interviews and documents help pinpoint areas of interest. Sometimes drone-mounted Lidar is then deployed to detect unusually lush patches of forest, since decomposing bodies make trees grow especially fast. Finally, investigators use DNA, as well as chemical analyses of soil, clothing, teeth, hair and bones to identify the dead.Forensic anthropologist Alma Vásquez showed me around the laboratory. Eight human skeletons were laid out on blue tables. Under each table was a cardboard box marked with a location, date of recovery and ID number. Three of the skeletons were tiny. These were children found with two adults in a cave outside the village of Estancia de la Virgen, a couple of hours’ drive north-west of Guatemala City. Vásquez believed that the bones belonged to a family that had tried to escape a notorious massacre that took place by the Pixcayá River in 1982. The cranium of the smallest skeleton rested on striped red and pink padding. Vasquez estimated that the child was between one and three years old, and fragments of clothing suggested she had been a girl.The front of her cranium had been blown away by a grenade. There was a bullet hole through the back of her head.If Vasquez’s hypothesis was correct, the little girl and her family belonged to a large community that fled their villages in early 1982. In the months prior, the“Guerrilla Army of the Poor”, which dominated in largely Indigenous villages in the area, had “freed” a small territory. As the government’s counterinsurgency focused on civilians, whom they assumed supported the guerrillas, the escaping families had sought refuge in the wooded and hilly upper banks of the Pixcayá.View image in fullscreenA member of staff at the Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Foundation (FAFG).Photograph: Marcus HaraldssonOn the morning of 18 March, army units marched from three directions towards the gathering by the river. At 8am they opened fire at men, women and children with guns and grenade launchers. The slaughter lasted for hours. Eyewitnesses reported that troops raped women and drowned children in the river. By mid-morning the forest was burning and army helicopters were shooting fleeing survivors.Estimates of the dead at the Pixcayá River range between 300 and 400. Makeshift mass graves were dug on the river shore. There were reports of dogs in nearby villages gnawing on human bones. The skeletons of the little girl and her family that are now in Alma Vásquez’s forensic lab were not found until 2008. Their DNA has still not been matched with any survivors.The massacre was one of the largest that took place during the bloodiest phase of the war in the early 1980s. But the event was typical in its systematic targeting of civilians. The eventual Commission for Historical Clarification, one of several official truth initiatives,identified 626 massacrescarried out by government forces. They were deemed responsible for more than 93% of human rights violations. The report also described 32 mass killings perpetrated by guerrilla groups.The war claimed more than 200,000 lives, and 83% of identified victims were Maya. More than 40,000 people are still missing. This sometimes means that relatives cannot claim inheritance, and that spouses cannot remarry or assert parenthood in unrecognised relationships. It also means that families do not get closure. FAFG currently holds 12,611 skeleton samples. Some were retrieved from mass graves, while others were discovered in road constructions or as homeowners expanded basements. Almost 4,000 individuals have been identified, mostly through DNA testing.The work of FAFG is regularly used in court. Most famously, it contributed to the guilty verdict against Guatemala’s former president Efraín Ríos Montt for genocide and crimes against humanity. On 10 May 2013, he was sentenced to 80 years in prison for crimes against the Ixil Maya people. FAFG’s forensic proof, along with testimonies from survivors, andleaked military documents, were vital evidence. The case centred on 15 massacres, where 1,771 people were killed by security forces under Ríos Montt’s command. “The verdict was crucial for people’s sense of belonging in the country,” Claudia Paz y Paz, who was attorney general at the time of the sentencing, told me.In the end, however, it was a small victory. The sentence was suspended 10 days later on a technicality and Ríos Montt was deemed too old for retrial. Even so, the ruling prompted a significant backlash. Military-linked networks and economic elites reasserted control of the justice system through judicial appointments, fabricated disciplinary cases and legislative changes.Many lawyers involved in the post-civil war processes, as well as human rights activists and leading journalists, are today in legal detention or exile. And political murdershave increased. Luis Pacheco and Héctor Chaclán, the leaders of the Indigenous movement that protected the democratic vote to install the current president, have so far spent 10 months in custody on seemingly spurious charges of terrorism and obstruction of justice.“With a corrupt judiciary, the democratic government has very limited powers,” said Claudia Paz y Paz, who now lives in Costa Rica and would be at risk if she were to return home. During the spring of 2026, a range of consequential appointments will be made to Guatemala’s Supreme Election Tribunal, constitutional court, and attorney general. Impartial jurists in these positions, Paz y Paz concluded, will be crucial for the system to hold.Near the site of the Pixcayá River massacre lies the town of San Juan Sacatepéquez. A few blocks from the market, Blanca Subuyui and her team work on more urgent matters than the deep origins of their people, or even the bloody history of the civil war. Subuyui’s organisation, Asociación Grupo Integral de Mujeres Sanjuaneras (Agims), offers shelter and assistance from nurses, midwives and lawyers to deal with the consequences of rape, domestic violence and child pregnancies. Agims also offers conflict mediation, professional education in weaving and handicrafts and a seedbank for agriculture. Some of the women who assist the network must hide their participation from their husbands.“We believe we have something to bring for the future of this country,” Subuyui told me over a large serving of fruit. As the leader of Agims, she has helped develop a comprehensive plan for the future ofIxumulew, “the land of maize” as Guatemala is called in the Kaqchikel language. The title of the text,Ri qab’e rech jun Utzilaj K’aslemal, translates roughly as “Our path toward the good life”. The236-page documenthas been developed during a seven-year process involving 164 Indigenous organisations.Guatemala’s baby brokers: how thousands of children were stolen for adoptionRead moreIts very first demands are the “full recognition of Indigenous Nations as pre-existing the state of Guatemala”, that these nations should “reclaim self-determination and sovereignty over our territories” and start by conducting a census without the “intention of making us disappear”. The document also calls for reorganisation of the army away from the structures that committed the genocide and asks that large companies should “pay the taxes they owe the country”.“We do not want to take power from anybody, but we are the majority of the population, and it is fair that we have a seat at the table,” said Subuyui.“But how can this plan be realised?” I asked. “There is only one Indigenous woman in parliament, out of 160.”Subuyui described the growth of their organisation. How Agims and other groups are making a difference in their communities, how people now know their rights and are starting to support themselves financially, how there is pride in history and trust in a shared future.I told her about the fear that Sonia Gutiérrez had expressed to me about revenge. And how prominent human rights leaders, judges and journalists are imprisoned, exiled, even murdered. Subuyui answered calmly: “Well, we are going nowhere. The struggle will continue, and the changes are now so profound that they are unstoppable. We will keep working no matter what, because we must. Change might take generations, but it is coming.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readIndigenous peoplesGuatemalaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And it is above all vital that at least one part of his empire of influence – football, sport, Manchester United – rejects it, as the club have done to some extentin their statement.Guardian view on Sir Jim Ratcliffe: Britain does not need political lectures from a billionaire tax exile | EditorialRead moreWhen Ratcliffe bought his stake in United he made some initial attempts at presenting himself as a kind of billionaire of the people, our own clog-clapping son of the cobbles, Eccles cakes tumbling from his turn-ups, essentially on a mission of benevolent regeneration.In reality Ratcliffe was always here to sack the tea lady. Ineos has a highly successful set of methods. Strip it back. Cut the fat. Access funding. But then, becoming a billionaire is not an act of benevolent collectivism. It requires supreme self-serving narrow focus.This is simply the landscape. No doubt we can look forward to the owners of other Premier League football clubs, for example the autocratic ruling families of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, disagreeing in the strongest terms with Big Sir Jim’s views, standing up for the little guy, calling for more gruel for everyone.So yes, there is this point of view. You could very easily be cynical, jaded, lost in realpolitik at the revelation that Ratcliffe feels it useful to pretend Britain is in economic difficulty because of an invading army of foreigners. And that Nigel Farage, arch deregulator, seems, in his disinterested view, an entirely reasonable voice on this topic.Let us be clear about what is happening here. There is very little chance Ratcliffe feels any of this deeply. But he does know that a slash-and-burn Reform government would be good for business. With his Ineos hat on Ratcliffe has spoken publicly about the problems of doing business in the current version of a non-EU UK. He wants a harder out.Immigration is just a wedge issue in this dynamic, a way of pressing those buttons. If Ratcliffe actually gives a personal toss about this, is actually losing any sleep about its effects on “everyday people”, I will gladly eat my own arm. This is pre-electioneering on behalf of the super-wealthy. A powerful person with skin in the game is trying to influence people into voting a certain way.0:38'The UK has been colonised by immigrants,' says Man United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe – videoAnd, yes, there is a so-what angle here. You can say whatever you like, particularly if you’re rich and powerful. Free speech is a thing, even factually incorrect free speech. But it does matter what Ratcliffe says, and for two very obvious reasons.First, the position he holds comes with responsibilities. Football is giving him this platform. Football in its current form is the greatest global megaphone ever devised. His views on this topic are being broadcast for one reason: because people like or wish to consumeManchester United.With this in mind the first responsibility is to get his facts right. Ratcliffe stated, incorrectly, that the UK population had increased by 12 million since 2020 which, if it were true, would be a genuine case of infrastructure breakdown. He also used the word “colonised” to describe the effects of immigration, a highly loaded and inflammatory word, deliberately chosen.And yeah he’s right in one way. Britain has been colonised by foreigners since the Beaker people. The Normans. The anglicised Saxons who gave Ratcliffe his name. But the language is grimly familiar. Colonisers don’t just arrive. They invade, take control, seize power. And what do you do with colonisers? You eject them, you rebel, you take up arms. Ratcliffe is not simply saying we have a problem with numbers or integration. His vocabulary is insisting on division and separation, the evil outside versus the good and the native.Does he really not know what “colonised” implies? Does a multibillionaire really not understand figures to the extent he can parrot something so obviously incorrect? Does he realise this kind of rhetoric prevents serious debate, takes away the ability of politicians to say, yes, maybe there is a problem, one that can be too quickly dismissed by those on the left who don’t perhaps appreciate the real-life pressures, or fear they too will be caught up in the rhetoric of racists and opportunists.Instead we have this, the language of the internet, misinformation and vitriol further normalised by our highest-profile football-coded billionaire. There is a playbook to be followed here. Ratcliffe has now semi-apologised, which means he can say he has actually apologised. But the substance of what he says will remain, echoing through the ecosystem, toxifying the soil.Farage has already noted the name check, another tick for the way power flows in this country. And again, this matters, because football gave Ratcliffe this platform. The Premier League’s tireless marketing arm is empowering it.Manchester United are being misused. For all the corporate gloss, United’s real power lies in their congealed but enduring status as a community object, a big tent, a place for all-comers. Their co-owner has no business using this carefully stitched thing to spread his political counter-messages.View image in fullscreenJim Ratcliffe has prompted protests from Manchester United fans during his tenure.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersThe city of Manchester is also being misrepresented. The line Ratcliffe is parroting is at odds with the city’s spirit, its football clubs, its sporting culture. Manchester is a port city built on generations of incomers. It’s a mixed-up muddled-up multipack of people bumping up against each other. Its energy is open, mix-and-match, outward-looking.To his credit Andy Burnham, who has cosied up in the past to the regeneration aspects of the Ratcliffe regime, has been quick to reject this targeted line. Burnham understands his city. He also understands what this is, the politics of endorsement and opportunity.And of course football itself is being weaponised. There is a moral issue, an issue of ownership, of sport once again co-opted by power. Very few things remain that have at their sclerotic and compromised heart an idea of community, openness, collectivism. More prosaically the Premier league, defined in its statutes as anti-prejudice and anti-division, is being piggybacked for a party political broadcast (with a bit of Keir Starmer thrown in, like an Ofcom-friendly disclaimer).We can still revolt against this pulling of the levers, see it for the spume of vomit it really is. We see you, corporate interests, the politics of fear. And no thank you, not here, not on our pitch. But the second point about Ratcliffe is, as ever, something more diffuse, a kind of sadness.It always feels like Manchester United are trying to tell you something. Why are people so obsessed with this club? Because it is basically Britain, a grand, sodden dying empire, decorously putrid, still just about operational for all the leaks and creaks and wet rot. How do we rewire and refurbish this thing? How do we generate energy, but also shed the drag of the past?Against this backdrop getting to know Sir Jim has been a deeply depressing project. First because he is a terrible club owner, so naive he seems to have genuinely believed he should have a say in the style of football. So vague on details he employed the world’s most rigidly deluded systems manager and gave him a squad of off-cuts and leftovers.There has also been a sense of wider doom watching him in action. Here we have someone who was at one point Britain’s richest man. This is what we’ve got. An icon of industry. Our own domestic titan. This is England, the safest hands we have, our own billionaire-dad, our finance Gandalf. And he appears to be completely clueless. Or at least deliberately, carelessly cynical in the way he presents himself.This is the creeping fear. Maybe there really are no grown-ups left on this mist-sodden island. Maybe dad really is an idiot. Either way, here we go again retailing bullshit, putting our hopes in a 73-year-old who can’t add up, out there using football as his radio, telling us the family next door are here to take our public services, so you’d better get out and vote for the guy most likely to empower my business.At some point everything in this picture can be rejected. Manchester United supporters may be stuck with Ratcliffe. But football, sport and everything in its arc can reject the things he is asking us to do, refuse to be spooked, refuse to fall into the arms of the opportunist he is promoting. Who knows, maybe one day this kind of messaging, its cynicism, its contempt for the public, may just flick a switch and drive us a little closer.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedJim RatcliffeFootball politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It won’t be thePeter Mandelsonscandal, the policy U-turns or the bleak nights at provincial counting centres. All these are symptoms, not the disease. No, what is turning the guy elected just 19 months ago into an ex-prime minister is the slow realisation among ministers, colleagues and voters of one essential truth about the man: there is less to him than meets the eye.His promises get shrunk in the wash. A green new deal is jettisoned, an Employment Rights Act has a large watering can poured over it, a bold manifesto pledge to end Britain’s feudal leasehold laws suddenly grows caveats.The same goes for his claimed achievements, a modest puddle that in sunlight swiftly evaporates. Just listen to his cabinet ministers this week, mouthing hostage-video messages of their boss’s achievements: a roll-call that begins with extended childcare – actually one of the last deeds of Rishi Sunak – andscrapping the two-child benefit cap, forced on No 10 by Labour backbenchers.In this land of vanished crafts and endangered trades, there did arise recently a nice cottage industry of defining “Starmerism”. Writers and academics tried to plumb its depths and chart its hinterland. Some bravely went as far as Reigate in Surrey to search for clues in the man’s childhood home, but all eventually gave up the task as hopeless, the last surrendering somewhere between his government’s ninth and 11th U-turn.They could have saved themselves the bother and simply defined it as shrinking ambitions, attainments, electoral base. It’s not a philosophy but a business model, and for years it was taken as a profitable one – even if some of uswarned of the dangers long ago. Now it is understood as leading only to bankruptcy.When Mandelson texted his Westminster apprentice Wes Streeting last March that “the government problems do not stem from comms”, he was spot on. The problem is not communications; it’s that there is so little to pass on. And when No 10 talks about how its resident willnow be “unleashed”, it will soon become apparent that there was no big beast to put on a lead.Starmer began his fightback this week with a solemn vow to purge Westminster lobbyists, a risible claim from a government filled with lobbyists. Jacqui Smith, the frontbencher sent out on Monday to defend her man was, until Starmer gave her a job, a lobbyist. Starmer’s jobs tsar, Alan Milburn, has mademore than £8m from lobbying, while another former New Labour minister, Jim Murphy, runs a lobbying firm where two staffers in 2024 became MPs for Starmer. Indeed, according to the journalist Peter Geoghegan, 34 of the most recent intake of Labour MPsworked in lobbying.Less-ism applies not just to the prime minister, but his circle; not just their policies, but their careers. Consider the man whose shadow looms over this entire week, the just-departed chief of staff,Morgan McSweeney. In their career obits, journalists across the press praised the man for three key achievements. First: he was the “hammer of the left” against what was left of Ted Knight’s Trotskyism in the London borough of Lambeth. The dates alone mean this can’t be true: when Knight ran Lambeth back in the 1980s, McSweeney would have been in primary school in County Cork. By the time the Irishman came to London Labour, the party’s big fight was not against “the hard left” but the Lib Dems.Second: he was the hero of the 2010 Battle for Barking, that mass mobilisation of anti-fascists against the British National party. It was a fight over months that culminated one Saturday in spring when more than 500 people turned out to campaign against Nick Griffin getting into parliament. Of a number of volunteers and witnesses I have spoken to about that campaign, no one remembers McSweeney playing a significant role. The Battle for Barking gets its own chapter in How to Defeat the Far Right by Nick Lowles, one of its organisers and a seasoned anti-fascist. McSweeney is not mentioned once by Lowles, either in the chapter or across the whole book. Among those who do get mentioned is Sam Tarry, a “young but experienced campaigner” from Barking, who even sleeps in the office to guard it from violent racists. Tarry later became aLabourMP, but was blocked from running again by Starmer and McSweeney’s regime.Finally, there is of course the landslide of 2024: a historic and remarkable turnaround, yet not the triumph that McSweeney and Starmer hoped for. They believed that flags and tanks might win over “hero voters” who had once been red but then turned blue. It didn’t. Labour’s overall vote share only rose by 1.6 percentage points on the great wipeout of 2019. The person who actually won the 2024 election for Starmer is clearly Liz Truss, a disaster in office while splitting the rightwing vote.The net result is that Starmer has a bigger majority than Clement Attlee in 1945, but a platform closer to Sunak’s. In a forthcoming textual analysis of the manifestos of the two parties down the decades, York University’s Kevin Farnsworth observes that Starmer’s manifesto for “change” was strikingly similar in language and positions to Sunak’s manifesto at the same election. It was, he writes, “a decisive embrace of positions historically closer to Conservative than Labour platforms”.Politicians and journalists love myth-making, but the danger of preferring legends to history is that you have no guide to take you forward. One of the guiding attitudes of Starmer and McSweeney’s regime has been that grave danger lies in looking even a few millimetres left, which is why he and his team have felt no compunction in taking pops at Andy Burnham and Sadiq Khan, and trying to kick out of their party anyone who even looked like a dissenter. Not just Jeremy Corbyn but peaceable figures from the soft left such as Neal Lawson (threatened with expulsion for endorsing a call on Twitter for cross-party cooperation).I’ve watched every minute of the hour’s worth of footage of the former Labour metro mayor Jamie Driscoll getting browbeaten by party bureaucrats for simply sitting on stage with the legendary leftwing film-maker Ken Loach. I’ve also read the accounts of long-serving councillors and community figures barred from even being considered as a Labour candidate for parliament for such apparent misdemeanours as “liking” atweet from Nicola Sturgeonsaying that she was free of Covid.This is McCarthyism dressed up as election-winning politics and it has failed. The result is not much of a government, and barely even a party. It’s a faction, a nasty narrow rightwing faction of what was once one of democracy’s great pluralist traditions. In place of real politics, it has office politics. The refrain that Starmer is a “decent” man does not fit his record of deceiving his way to the top of the Labour party, sitting on his hands during the massacre in Gaza or clamping down on protest against it.This government is already toast, one Labour heavyweight told me this week, but the Labour party – a 125-year-old political project – may not survive Starmer and McSweeney. The diminution of the party’s horizons is clear when one considers the leadership election to come. Fifty years ago, the battle to replace Harold Wilson drew heavyweights from Tony Benn to Roy Jenkins. In 2015, the range went from Corbyn to Liz Kendall. This year we are likely to have Streeting, a former student politician, versus someone from the soft left. There are no ideas in contest here, little semblance of a plan for change.Now the shrinking is being done for them by us, the voters. Labour’s polling is disastrous. At each election, leftwing voters ask: who is the candidate to stop Farage’s candidate? In Caerphilly, it was Plaid Cymru. In Gorton and Denton this month it may be the Greens. But it rarely seems to be Starmer.Voters are actively searching out alternatives. Because why should they settle for less?Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistThis article was amended on 12 February 2026. An earlier version said Tony Benn and Roy Jenkins took part in the contest to replace Jim Callaghan as Labour prime minister; however, it was Harold Wilson who had resigned.Explore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerMorgan McSweeneyPeter MandelsonLobbyingcommentShareReuse this content"

A genuinely humane government would reform itAndrea EganNew proposals that would force poorly paid migrant workers to wait longer for earned settlement are nothing more than an assault on working-class peopleAndrea Egan is the general secretary of UnisonThu 12 Feb 2026 09.10 ESTLast modified on Thu 12 Feb 2026 11.48 ESTShareBillionaires and politicians fan the flames of hate, but without migrant workers, Britain would grind to a halt. That’s especially true when it comes to health and social care:more than a fifthof the NHS workforce is made up of migrant staff. The same proportion of care workers nationally are migrants, rising tohalfin London.Yet these workers, many of whom are members of Unison, have increasingly become a punchbag for politicians. In particular, they have become a scapegoat for this Labour government, which has sunk to a new low with its proposals onearned settlement. These changes could see low-paid public sector workers, including carers, forced to wait15 yearsbefore being granted indefinite leave to remain, instead of the five years they were promised before they made the decision to come here. These changes would entrench and worsen the environment of fear and exploitation that defines the current system.This is nothing less than a full-frontal attack on migrant workers and a wrecking ball for public services from a government that should be standing up for both. We already have a visa system that ties care workers to their employers, leaving them vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Months without pay. Working without days off for weeks on end. Grafting for 16 hours and only getting paid for two of them.As Unison general secretary, I have been speaking to our migrant members in the care sector, and what I hear is harrowing. “Every conversation with the managers feels threatening, and often ends with the word ‘visa’,” a domiciliary care worker from India said. Another member put it starkly: “We cannot continue to work under these kinds of pressures. It is emotionally draining and mentally exhausting. You lose yourself. Fear becomes your shadow.”When Unison raises these issues with politicians, we are often told it’s just a few “bad apple” employers. But insecure work, zero-hour contracts, illegally low pay and exploitative practices more widely are endemic throughout the social care sector. Our members are silenced as the threat of deportation is punitively held over them. I don’t say it lightly, but the sponsorship system has effectively made modern slavery a structural feature of our care system.A genuinely humane government would do away with this heartless system. But despite the urging of Unison – in anational campaignled by our migrant members – this Labour government is proposing to extend it. For many of our members who had only months left before being freed from the terrifying vulnerability of sponsorship, the Home Office is proposing to lock them into exploitation for another decade and more.These proposals are not just an attack on the migrant care workers who work beyond breaking point to look after us. They are also an attack on the most basic values of theLabourparty, in offering rapid routes to settlement for those earning six-figure salaries while making lower-paid workers wait and continue to suffer.Such a hierarchy is based on the notion that care workers are “low-skilled”becausethey are low-paid. The logic could not be more perverse. Care work is highly skilled work, and it is only paid so poorly because of the failure of successive governments to value it properly. The Home Officedescribingthose who run our health and social care system as low contributors and making this a metric of human worth, having failed to ensure they are paid fairly, is an attack on the working class.Care in England is already creaking, and without urgent action it risks outright collapse. The demand our migrant members are dealing with is gargantuan. Age UK estimates that 2 million older people haveunmet care needs, while up to 1.5 million working-age disabled people may be missing out on support they are entitled to.At the same time, the workforce is haemorrhaging staff, with vacancy rates among the highest of any sector and nearly a quarter of workers leaving each year. The root cause is no mystery – it’s low pay. Four in five jobs in the wider economy pay better than the care sector. Such depressed wages push workers into poverty and food insecurity.Sadly, the government seems determined to make the environment for migrant workers in this country more hostile than ever. But Unison will always stand up for our members, regardless of where they were born. Indeed, in leading our Fair Visa Campaign, migrant members are standing up for themselves: late last year,they organisedone of the biggest parliamentary lobbies in modern history, with 700 migrant workers travelling to meet their MPs. This week, more than 70 parliamentariansjoined usin opposing the unfair indefinite leave to remain changes.Labour MPs vying to replace the prime minister must take the fight to the far right instead of imitating it, stand up for migrant workers by dropping the earned settlement proposals, and represent thewholeworking class. This is the stuff of basic principles. Unison will use its unparalleled size and resources without hesitation to challenge any politician who fails to live up to them.Andrea Egan is the general secretary of UnisonExplore more on these topicsCare workersOpinionMigrationSocial careLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Michael Carrick, for his part, said he was aware of the haircut issue. But theManchester Unitedcoach insisted it would not factor into his team’s preparations for their game against West Ham on Tuesday night.And so, here we are. Many games of football end up being remembered for reasons far outstripping their original significance: the 1914 Christmas Truce, the 1962 Battle of Santiago, the 2020 pandemic curtain‑raiser between Liverpool and Atlético Madrid. To these we can add the Haircut Game: a mildly arresting1-1 Premier League draw at the London Stadiumthat posterity will nevertheless recall as the game when a man did not get his hair cut at the end.Sesko’s nonchalance late strike show of resilience that enhances Carrick’s cause | Barney RonayRead moreThe haircut overshadowed the buildup, the live commentary and much of the post-match analysis on TNT Sport, as well as a ground radius of about a metre around the haircut itself. On the video streaming platform Kick, a quarter of a million viewers watched a live feed of the unshorn Frank Ilett – now known as The United Strand – watching his beloved United going for a fifth consecutive win that would free him from his pilar purgatory.As United conceded an early goal through Tomas Soucek, the camera would occasionally zoom in on Ilett, a lifelong United fan now fatally trapped, Janus‑like, between two countervailing faces of devotion. From the moment back in October 2024 when he pledged to avoid cutting his hair until United won five games in a row in all competitions, his viral fame, personal fortune and perhaps his very identity had become inextricably entwined with United being bad at football.The worse they were, the longer his hair grew, the more Instagram followers he accrued, the louder the stampede of brands and corporate partners to his door. He now has a deal with a talent agency, a budding career as a content creator, endorsements falling out of his pockets.On Monday morning he held a press conference attended by the Telegraph, CBS and L’Equipe. On Tuesday morning a press release dropped from Argos, announcing that it had signed Ilett as an Official Delivery Partner, and was poised to dispatch a shipment of trimmers and hair styling products to his home as soon as the curse was broken.And perhaps this is the moment to take a step back. Why are we talking about the haircut guy? Because in a very real and very bleak sense, the haircut guy is a perfect parable for where we are as a species: scrolling onanistically through our smartphones, captives of the attention economy, consensually playing the very same game that enslaves us. Football in the year of Our Lord 2026: a sport born on the playing fields of 19th‑century England, codified into teams and leagues, and now essentially in thrall to a guy performatively not cutting his hair for the social media aura.If this feels a stretch, then consider that in a Dazn interview this week Cunha said that the haircut guy was being openly discussed in the United dressing room, spoke of “the pressure of the haircut”, a phrase now destined to sit alongside “the weight of the shirt” as an actual, genuine footballing trope. Does content feed off football or does football feed off content? These days, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to tell the two apart.There are really two questions that follow here. The first is: to what extent is football still primarily about the winning and losing of football matches? This used to be a cherishably simple question to answer. But in the age of the algorithm, when the arena and the media ecosystem that surrounds it have been reimagined as a kind of elite advertising space, where sporting products sell themselves on attention as much as success, it’s not so easy.The most bankable boxer in the world is Jake Paul, an objectively terrible fighter. The most bankable female rugby player in the world is Ilona Maher, for whom it is only the merest inconvenience that she doesn’t actually play rugby any more. India are the powerbrokers of world cricket whether they win or lose. Does it really matter for the product if Wrexham are soaring through the divisions or plummeting back down through them? Has 13 years of incompetence made any discernible difference to United’s bottom line, their corporate shadow, their ability to generate views?Certainly the spectacle of United being bad at football has provided a very handy living to a whole host of satellite characters: Ilett, Andy Tate, Mark Goldbridge, Ruben Amorim. On Tuesday Arne Slot explained that Liverpool simply must qualify for the Champions League because of the finances involved, rather than because, you know, it gives them a chance of winning the Champions League. The modern football club exists purely for the sake of existing, purely so it can continue to deliver its primary functions: generating content and buying players so they can generate more content.The second question: what is the point of any of this? What is the end goal of life, in a world where exploitative structures and technocapitalist attention capture strip individuals of all but the most basic agency?It’s easy enough to throw hand grenades at Ilett, a posh lad from Oxford who once lived in total anonymity and now appears on livestreams festooned in betting adverts. Recently he went to Old Trafford and had his hair pulled by a United fan. But in a world rewired almost entirely around social media clout and the tyranny of the algorithm, is he not simply navigating a hostile landscape in the only way he can?This is all one feed now, and as grotesque as it sounds, everyone from the new Taylor Swift video to the starving children of Gaza to The United Strand is playing in the same space, by the same rigged rules, grabbing forlornly at the keys of the discourse. What did you all think influencers meant? Vibes, papers, essays? In his shameless grift and uncut locks, the United haircut guy is at least holding up a mirror to what we really are.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s got a name –the “Claude crash”, referencing the plug-in legal products added by the AI firm Anthropic to its Claude Cowork office assistant.This launch, or so you would think from thepanicked stock market reactionin the past few weeks, marks the moment when the AI revolution rips chunks out of some of the UK’s biggest public companies – those in the dull but successful “data” game, including Relx, the London Stock Exchange Group, Experian, Sage and Informa.Relx, the former Reed Elsevier, whose brands include the Lancet and LexisNexis, is the most intriguing in that list. The company’s description of itself contains at least five words to provoke a yawn – “a global provider of information-based analytics and decision tools for professional and business customers” – but the pre-Claude share price was a thing of wonder. It was £5 in 2012 and £41 in May last year, at which point Relx was worth £70bn-ish and was the fifth-largest company in the FTSE 100 index.And now? The shares have halved from their highs and the biggest falls have come since Claude’s supposedly terror-inducing plug-ins appeared. The market has flipped from seeing Relx as an AI winner – because it is using AI to boost existing products – to fearing its beautiful 34% profit margin will implode.What does the company itself think? Well, Thursday’s full-year results were not titled “the stock market’s gone mad”, because that’s not Relx’s style. But the numbers and statement oozed confidence: revenues up 7% to £9.6bn and operating profits up 9% to £3.3bn; a forecast of “another year of strong growth in 2026”; a dividend raised 7%; and a bigger share buyback of £2.25bn.Chief executive Erik Engström also offered a coherent argument for why the evolution of AI would “remain a key driver of customer value and growth in our business for many years to come”.Short version: AI tools are not new; the recent launches that have caused the fuss are “workflow” products for storing, sorting and reviewing documents for specific projects; Relx mostly fishes in the smaller market for must-have information that is comprehensive and can be relied upon in court.Some of Relx’s data may be public, some may have been public in the past but no longer is so; some is hard to find; some is licensed; some is proprietary; it all comes with “judgments, inferences and interpretations gathered over decades” that are useful to scientists, lawyers, insurance and City professionals and risk assessors; and AI may assist in that value-adding process, or just make the stuff easier for customers to use.His other big point is that Relx is free to do limited licensing deals with AI companies if it wishes, and can continue to launch its own “workflow” products, but it is never going to surrender its impossible-to-replicate proprietary information because that’s where the value in its business lies.It was good for a 2% bounce in the share price, which is better than nothing, but still suggests market worries about where the AI evolution goes next, and whether Relx’s “competitive moat”, as the analysts say, is as deep as advertised. The issue, in part, is fear of the unknown.But Relx’s tactical response should be obvious. If it thinks growth can be relied upon “for many years to come”, as Engström says, and, if the shares are available at half the price of a year ago, just keep the buybacks rolling.This year’s £2.25bn version, up from £1.5bn, equates to 6% of the entire equity base. If it keeps up that pace for a few years, it will get a serious boost to earnings per share – assuming, of course, that the projections for the business itself really are solid.Bigger buybacks, reportedly, are also the activist investor Elliott Management’s prescription at LSEG, where the AI worries and counter-arguments are similar. If you are truly confident, it is the right thing to do.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Nils Pratley on financeLondon Stock ExchangeSharesTechnology sectorInvestingFinancial sectorcommentShareReuse this content"

She didn’t want it to become the headline that she sometimes thinks of herself as a gay man – but clearly forgot how neurotic and demagogic much of the British press becomes if you say anything mildly provocative about sexuality and gender.Here’s what happened. Inan interviewlast week with the American LGBTQ+ publication Them, when asked about her penchant for taking roles in films featuring LGBTQ+ characters (say, The Favourite or Heartstopper), the actor said that she feels that she has a foot in various camps. “Throughout my whole life, I’ve had arguments with people where I’ve always felt sort of nonbinary … I’ve never felt massively feminine in my being female. I’ve always described myself to my husband as a gay man. And he goes, ‘Yeah, I get that.’”Now, you could easily park this in the category of “vacuous things celebrities say when attempting to get you to watch their film” (in this case,Jimpa, in which Colman plays the mother of a non-binary teenager). Or in another, even more obnoxious category: “things wealthy white celebrities with cushty lives say to make themselves sound a little more interesting”. Britain’s rightwing media has been unforgiving. The Telegraph asked if she is “the most insufferable Left-wing celebrity in Britain” while, for UnHerd, Colman is “a handmaiden in the contemporary rebirth of anti-woman logic” and has committed “a drive-by erasure of the homosexual male experience”.But honestly, what is the big deal? As a gay man, I read Colman’s comments and felt something more like relief. Truth be told, as one of three boys, I have sometimes referred to myself as “my mother’s only daughter”, and I’ve never thought to count myself out when my predominantly female friends refer to us as “the girls” on a night out. I’ve been invited to many a “galentines”.I know that I am a man – just like, I’m sure, Colman knows that she is a woman. But the truth is that many, if not all of us, experience moments of disorientation around gender or think about how ridiculous the whole system of categorising identities is. You may find Colman’s comments confusing and incoherent, but how confusing is it that our behaviours, identities and very beings are expected to be neatly and continually divided based on our private parts and what we do with them?As for “a drive-by erasure of the homosexual male experience” – what tosh. I am fine if heterosexual women sometimes feel that they have a foot in gay male identity. I am a Madonna fanatic (a very gay thing of me to be) and often find myself nodding in agreement when listening to her 2000 hit What It Feels Like for a Girl, which she wrote while trying to conceal her pregnancy from the media. I will never know the experience of pregnancy or of being a woman, but whenever I listen I do find myself thinking: “yes, world,do youknow what it feels like for a girl???” What is so wrong with that?Likewise, Colman or any other heterosexual woman might find themselves participating in, or relating to, aspects of gay male culture that they feel an affinity with. And clearly anyone can tap into aspects of gay culture. The brilliant theorist of gender David Halperin, in his book How to Be Gay, carefully argues that while stereotypes of gay male behaviour might be offensive, they are clearly based in reality. He goes on to say that gayness is more than just who you have sex with, it is also “something you do”. This “means that you don’t have to be homosexual in order to do it”. It’s an idea that would make so many people furiously protective, but I am keen on an expansive view of identity that isn’t simply reduced to core biological functions and urges.This might all seem like a storm in a teacup – throwaway comments getting sucked through social media and thrown into the culture war meat-grinder in Britain. But however seriously Colman meant her comments, they have an important effect – making us all think about the ways in which gender shows up in our lives as a silly, messy and contradictory prism for understanding ourselves. We should be able to talk about reconciling experiences of campness, butchness, femininity and masculinity – we should be able to express the feeling that we’re something other than what we’ve been categorised as. So, Colman, ignore the cynics: remember that, just like your husband, many of us heard your words and thought: yeah, I get it.Jason Okundaye is an assistant Opinion editor at the GuardianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The problem has endured for too longThu 12 Feb 2026 05.41 ESTLast modified on Thu 12 Feb 2026 07.35 ESTShareAs the BBC closes in on a new director general, the possibility again arises that it could be a woman. The talk is of the former BBC One controllerJay Hunt, the former Channel 4 boss Alex Mahon or the former BBC chief content officerCharlotte Moore.At this point in the BBC’s history, almost everyone would applaud a woman at the top – but clearly the institution needs a lot more than a woman, however pioneering and accomplished, at the helm. We know from theexcoriating reportcommissioned by the broadcaster itself that it has a grave problem with dwindling numbers of “older women” presenters. Trevor Phillips, 72, still shines at Sky, while David Aaronovitch, 71, is deservedly a fixture on Radio 4: they’re just older men, experienced journalists, doing their thing.But women are different, it seems – especially after midlife, according to the report, with a “noticeable mismatch” at theBBCin the treatment of women over 60 in news, in content more broadly and in regional broadcasting (so pretty much everything).This will come as zero surprise to female broadcasters who have been saying this for years, but who have been fobbed off by too-busy-to-care commissioners or have been urged to be content with a short slot on someone else’s presenting gig (usually a man’s). Worse, they will have been made to feel pushy or insistent for wanting a fair share of the limelight. Any new director general, male or female, needs to know how this plays out – and to figure out how to change it.View image in fullscreenFrom left to right: Charlotte Moore, Jay Hunt and Alex Mahon, all of whom have been linked with the director general role at the BBC.Composite: VariousFrom the report, we see that the broadcaster has made progress with female presenters under 50, so something clearly happens to make them disappear thereafter. That process can seem inexorable. They move from being called “veteran” reporters to appearing less and less, and then just giving up on attempts to get the good-quality work they want. They move into a parallel world as opportunities dwindle and others are picked for roles they were not encouraged to apply for, filling openings they never knew existed.There are women inside the organisation who have taken it to task – including in legal disputes,alleging unfair practices as they aged. But winning legal battles is not the same as changing a culture.I can speak to the feeling of a largish group of broadcasters whom I call “inside-outers”: those connected to, but not directly employed by, the corporation. We have been around at the BBC but can speak independently. I started commentating from the wars in Yugoslavia and from Moscow when Boris Yeltsin was Russian president. I now present on the arts and ideas show Free Thinking, and appear as a Moral Maze panellist on Radio 4. That is a very agreeable situation, and broadcasters do worry about being seen as whingers, which can become a double bind. If we don’t raise an issue, we are judged to be content – not just for ourselves, but with the situation in general.The new director general will need to be more keenly aware of the excuses that facilitate this disappearing of female presenters, whether staff or freelance. Here is some of the overfamiliar reasoning: “We need to refresh the coverage or range of voices, so this means ringing the changes.” This will be followed by the realisation that the programme’s solid bloke has survived the “refresh” because they are an authoritative kingpin, while the women have been refreshed out.View image in fullscreenThe former BBC Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly, who in 2011 won an employment tribunal against the BBC on the grounds of ageism.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The ObserverAnother fob-off runs: “Your name will be at the table.” Never believe this. Clearly, a broadcaster can’t run a Britain’s Got Talent-style quest every time a vacancy opens, but when the circle of applicants is drawn tight and the process is opaque, who actually gets anywhere near the table and who is excluded on the grounds that they don’t fit is the point.There’s also: “What’s the problem? You’re doing fine as it is – and anyway, there is a queue round the block to host Gardeners’ Question Time/Just a Minute/Whatever show you’re interested in.” Translated, it means: “I cannot be bothered with this conversation.”No one would say the problem is exclusive to the BBC. Who can forget the “Last fuckable day”skit by Tina Fey, Amy Schumer, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Patricia Arquette, highlighting the sell-by date on women getting sexy Hollywood roles. This is the less sexy equivalent. But we do expect more from a broadcaster that is also a thought leader.In a 2017 article for the Guardian,I wrote: “The BBC’s intellectual spadework is still done mainly by men of a similar outlook and type. Director general Tony Hall should get on with changing that, but distortions will persist until broadcasters think more adventurously about what women are capable of.”That was nine years ago now. How much opportunity and talent has been washed away since then? How much more in TV, in radio and now in podcasting will be squandered unless someone finally stops BBC women disappearing?Incoming director general, whether you’re male or female: good luck. So many female broadcasters inside and outside the Beeb’s walls would be happy to hear from you.Anne McElvoy is executive editor at Politico and host of Politics at Sam and Anne’s, as well as a BBC contributorExplore more on these topicsBBCOpinionInequalityWomenGendercommentShareReuse this content"

Sir Jim, by jetting off to a tax haven on the French Riviera,savedhimself an estimated £4bn. It took some brass neck for the expat owner of Ineos and co-owner of Manchester United football club tolecturethe country, using inflammatory and offensive language, on the perils of immigration.Where to begin? The statistics used by Sir Jim to back his claim that Britain was being “colonised” by migrants, in an interview with Sky News, were flatly wrong. They were also astonishingly crass, coming from a man who presides over a sporting institution famous for and proud of its global fanbase and international connections.Current Manchester United stars such as Cameroon’s Bryan Mbeumo and Côte d’Ivoire’s Amad Diallo will doubtless have their views on Sir Jim’s intervention. So will its French former icon, Eric Cantona – another coloniser whose genius generated a memorable outpouring offrancophiliaon the red side of Manchester. Representatives of the club’s many Muslim followers have already given theirs, questioning whether they should feel welcome in United’s Old Trafford stadium.TheIneosowner’s football interests have given his comments a prominence they would not have otherwise had. But the willingness of a high-profile public figure to echo great replacement theory tropes is yet another disturbing sign of the times.Sir Keir Starmer was right to describe Sir Jim’s as “offensive and wrong” on Thursday. But he himself was obliged last summer to express belated regret for asserting that Britainriskedbecoming “an island of strangers”. Reform UK’s highest-profile recruit, Robert Jenrick, has notoriously noted the absence of white faces in a district of Birmingham. The previously unsayable is being routinely said, as Nigel Farage and Reform shift the parameters of legitimate speech in British public life.A rattled Sir Jim hasissueda statement in which he regretted causing offence but asserted the need for “open debate”. Normalising inflammatory language which presents migrants as hostile invaders does not enhance the possibility of civilised discussion. It contributes to the rise of everyday racism and xenophobia on the UK’s streets.Perhaps the most eloquent response to Sir Jim’s comments has come from the Manchester Labour mayor, Andy Burnham, whosaidthat they betrayed the values for which the city traditionally stood. In the 19th century, its mill workers went on strike in solidarity with enslaved cotton-pickers in the American south. As Reform seeks a statement victory in Gorton and Denton, with a candidate who has made dog-whistle nativism his calling card, Manchester has again become a political crucible.Mr Burnham, who wasdeniedhis wish to run against Reform in that race, is on one side of that fight. The Oldham-born co-owner of arguably England’s most famous football club has given an interview that plays to the talking points of the other. As Nigel Farage’s intellectual outridersspeakof a “politics of home”, which casts doubt over certain citizens’ right to be considered British, a billionaire tax exile in Monaco has added grist to their mill. The irony will not be lost on most Mancunians, despite panickedattemptsby Manchester United to limit the fallout. But the potential damage done is no laughing matter.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Preventing water theft. The streamlining of land purchases. If anyone doubted the real purpose of the motley collection ofnew administrative and enforcement measures for the illegally occupied West Bank, Israel’s defence minister spelt it out: “We will continue to kill the idea of a Palestinian state,” Israel Katz said in a joint statement with the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich.While the world’s attention was fixed upon the annihilation in Gaza, settlers in the West Bank intensified their campaign of ethnic cleansing. More than 1,000 Palestinianshave been killed theresince October 2023; a fifth of them were children. Many more have been driven from their homes by relentless harassment and the destruction of infrastructure, withentire Palestinian communities erasedacross vast swathes of land.The Israeli state is not merely complicit in these acts. In addition to theeconomic suffocationand increased military raids in the West Bank, the Guardian reported last month thatsettler-only units of the army are acting as “vigilante militias”. Haaretz newspaper reports that the military hasordered soldiers to prevent Palestinians from ploughingtheir land at the behest of settlers – not only threatening them with destitution, but paving the way for land seizure.With Israel heading to elections in months, Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners are in a hurry. While they and their allies have changed the facts on the ground dramatically, and have steadilyexpanded Israel’s control, the bureaucratic measures adopted by the security cabinet last Sunday are “tectonic”,as one scholar notes. They ease land theft, stripping away the very limited constraints on purchase, and destroy the nominal authority of Palestinians in areas A and B.The White House has reiterated Donald Trump’s opposition to annexation, but talks with Mr Netanyahu in Washington on Wednesday focused on Iran. To the extent that the US president thinks about Palestinians at all, he thinks about Gaza. Yet this cannot be treated separately from theWest Bank. Arab and Islamic states central to his peace plan have warned that the new measures will “inflame violence, deepen the conflict and endanger regional stability and security”.The declaration of a ceasefire in Gaza – which has not stopped the Israeli military killing Palestinians there either – has reduced the political pressure on other governments to act. There are no signs that the outrage at last Sunday’s decision will translate into action. The UK “strongly condemns” the measures. The EU said that sanctions were “still on the table” but is clearly in no hurry to act. WithinIsrael, only a handful dissent.Hunger and desperation endure in Gaza while the Trump administration promotes fantastical visions of a glittering skyline. Israel hasdemolished the East Jerusalem headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa), the UN body which supports millions of Palestinian refugees, and is booting out NGOs, including Médecins Sans Frontières, from across occupied Palestine.In 2024, the UN’s international court of justiceruled that Israel should end its illegal occupationas quickly as possible. Last year international outrage over Gaza forced multiple governments, including the UK, torecognise a Palestinian state, dragged by their publics. Those symbolic announcements look increasingly hollow. Real action cannot wait, for Israel’s government will not.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The proposals also risk a generational destruction of the country’s ability to produce skilled graduates, retain specialist knowledge, and support physical science in industrial and educational settings.This comes against a backdrop of wider threats to university finances, from rising costs to declining international student numbers. An estimatedone in fourUK physics departments are already at risk of closure, and recent cuts anddelaysto Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) grants have further depleted finances and will result in the loss of some highly skilled technical staff.Fundamental physics research drives technological innovation, from medical imaging to data processing, and trains the next generation in advanced analytical skills that transfer across technical fields. Far from being a prudent rebalancing, these cuts will cause uncontrolled and irreversible damage to an area in which the UK has genuine international leadership.Dr Phil BullJodrell Bank Centre for AstrophysicsProf Chris ClarksonQueen Mary University of LondonIan Sample describes well the terrifying cuts being imposed by UKResearchand Innovation (UKRI) and STFC on particle physics (and also astronomy and nuclear physics). UKRI has stated that the solution is to “do fewer things better”, which overlooks that in particle physics the UK already does fewer things than countries such as Germany, France and Italy.How does UKRI reward doing “fewer things better”? First, by imposing cuts averaging 30%, which will be impossible without decimating world-leading science. On top of that, UKRI has decided to cut funding to support a plannedupgradeto its Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment at Cern, for which £49.4m had been allocated and £5m has already been spent. Without UK funding, the international upgrade project – which all other major partner countries have now pledged to support – will collapse.At theInnovation for Growth summitlast year, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technologysaid: “We are already world-leading in basic curiosity-led science, and we are determined that that should continue.” The UK’s hard-earned leadership in projects such as LHCb is being thrown away to pay for problems created elsewhere in UKRI.Tim GershonUniversity of Warwick; LHCb spokesperson-electVincenzo VagnoniIstituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare; LHCb spokespersonIan Sample’s article rightly highlights young researchers fearing for their careers in the wake of the government’s cuts to physics, and it is deeply worrying for those who care about UK science.I had the privilege of working with hundreds of early-career scientists as former chief executive of the National Nuclear Laboratory, and their passion and skills are exactly what this country needs. The young scientists studying physics doctorates today are the people who will be making breakthroughs in key technologies in 10 years’ time. Some of them will take their skills in analysis and data to vital sectors such as AI, digital and health.At the Institute ofPhysics, we’re hearing every day from people who are now fearing for their jobs and despairing of a future in the UK. Some are considering moving abroad to China or Europe.These cuts cannot be the right path for a nation that aims to be a science superpower. We would be letting down innovators and harming our economy, society and future.Prof Paul HowarthInstitute of Physics, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Part of my training as a designer-pattern cutter involved a placement in a factory, an experience now rarely available to fashion students. In the 1980s, the government set up theEnterprise Allowance Schemeto encourage innovation, but there was no follow-on support to encourage production; successful entrepreneurs had to apply for personal loans from banks, limited to the value of their houses.I wanted to be part of a trade mission to Germany so I could follow up export inquiries, but I was told my business was too small. I had a unique product with distinctive English characteristics and the quality to command prices that would yield a good profit, and I did sell individual items to foreign visitors, but lacked the necessary weight to impress the Department of Trade officials. Increasing domestic sales indicated that I had the right product, but the margins would never yield the amount of investment needed.

In view of the inexorable spread of the greys across Great Britain, it was actually a surprise to learn there are still reds anywhere as central to the island as the Lake District. But it was also a disappointment to find that the article overlooked Welsh red squirrels entirely – despite the significant success of efforts to conserve them on Ynys Môn and the presence of a significant, genetically distinct population here in the Cambrian Mountains.Reds are, as you mention, the most-missed threatened mammal species of Great Britain, so we cannot afford to ignore any of their few remaining fastnesses. Ideally, we would also be taking concrete steps to protect those places from further erosion of habitat or human disturbance.Sadly, with the present dash to build renewable power stations anywhere that developers can find a landowner willing to sell, there are already two proposals to industrialise the hills above Llanddewi Brefi with turbines and solar, despite 24 years of theMid Wales Red Squirrel Project’s work to bolster the population there.

Japan’s Mitsuki Ono took bronze with 85.00.For a sport that has spent nearly a decade orbiting Kim’s technical and competitive standard, the result felt seismic – not because she rode poorly, but because someone else finally assembled the perfect combination of risk, execution and timing on the night it mattered most.Winter Olympics 2026: Ukrainian athlete kicked out over helmet tribute, Lollobrigida claims dramatic speed skating gold – liveRead moreThe loss ends one of the most dominant Olympic streaks in modern winter sport. Kim entered the Games as a two-time defending Olympic champion and the overwhelming favorite to complete a three-peat no snowboarder had ever achieved. Instead, the history belongs to someone else.The victory came less than six weeks after Kimdislocated her left shoulder, an injury that threatened to derail her Olympic buildup. Instead, the brace she wore throughout the competition became part of the story: a visible reminder of vulnerability for an athlete who has spent most of her career appearing nearly untouchable. Among those watching from the bottom of the pipe was her boyfriend, NFL star Myles Garrett, stationed near the photo pit with a camera in hand as he tracked each run.Kimfirst arrived as a global phenomenonat Pyeongchang 2018, when she became the youngest woman to win Olympic snowboard gold. Four years later in Beijing, she defended the title while navigating the expectations that come with being the face of a sport. In Livigno, the challenge was different: maintaining dominance while the rest of the field spent eight years trying to catch her.The final unfolded in three distinct phases: Kim setting the benchmark, the field chasing, and Choi delivering the decisive moment.View image in fullscreenChoi Gaon’s rebounded from a fall on her opening run for a stellar finish to secure the gold medal in Livigno.Photograph: Jeff Pachoud/AFP/Getty ImagesKim dropped in late in the start order and immediately established control with a composed opening run built around a backside 720, switch backside air and cab double cork 1080 sequence, finishing with the kind of amplitude and landing precision that judges consistently reward. Her 88.00 put immediate pressure on the rest of the field and held deep into the competition.Ono secured bronze early with a technically clean but slightly lower-ceiling run that topped out at 85.00, while riders including Japan’s Sara Shimizu and China’s Cai Xuetong pushed difficulty but lost ground on execution or amplitude in a final littered with crashes as snow swirled through the floodlit venue.Choi’s path to gold was far less straightforward. The 17-year-old World Cup leader – competing in her first Olympics – crashed heavily on her opening run after clipping the lip of the pipe, flipping upside down and landing hard. She lay on the snow for several minutes as medical staff attended to her, briefly raising fears she might withdraw.She eventually rode down under her own power but later revealed she had hurt her knee in the fall and struggled to walk immediately afterward.“After the first run, I actually cried really hard, thinking maybe I should just quit the Olympics here,” Choi said. “But the thought kept coming back to me: ‘You can do this. You have to go on.’”Her second run ended in another fall, leaving her medal hopes hanging by a thread. But on her final attempt – needing something close to perfect – she delivered exactly that, combining speed, amplitude and technical depth across her full line to post 90.25, the highest score of the night.“It’s the kind of story you only see in dreams,” she said. “Mentally it was so tough, but right now I am the happiest.”Winter Olympics: Chloe Kim settles for silver in snowboard halfpipe – as it happenedRead moreThe moment instantly flipped the pressure back to Kim, who still had a final run remaining but now needed to improve. She attempted to raise the difficulty ceiling, including a progression toward back-to-back double cork combinations, but could not put down a cleaner score than her opening benchmark.The result underscored how narrow the margins have become in women’s halfpipe. Kim still posted the top single score outside Choi and finished comfortably ahead of the rest of the field, but Olympic finals rarely allow room for anything less than perfection.Choi’s victory also signals a generational shift in a discipline increasingly dominated by teenage progression riders. Born in 2008 andmentored by Kim herself, she represents a new wave raised entirely in the technical ecosystem Kim helped create.The broader field reflected that evolution. Seven of the top eight finishers were 23 or younger, and multiple finalists attempted double-cork-level difficulty as standard competitive content rather than high-risk bonus tricks.For Kim, the result does little to diminish a career that has already reshaped the sport. She remains a two-time Olympic champion, three-time world champion and the rider most responsible for pushing the technical baseline of modern women’s halfpipe. She said she will undergo surgery on her shoulder after returning home.“I haven’t been able to practice as much as I would’ve liked,” Kim said. “A month ago, I wasn’t even sure if I would be here. I get emotional thinking about it. I really worked so hard to get here. This medal means so much to me.”But on a snowy night in Livigno, the sport finally moved – if only slightly – beyond Kim’s orbit. And for the first time in nearly a decade, Olympic halfpipe gold belonged to someone else.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUSA Olympic teamSnowboardingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

But the controversy surrounding the event is not merely a debate over artistic and technical merits.Gold went bya narrow marginto the French duo of Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron. It was a stunning achievement for a partnership that is less than a year old. But the union was forged after the fallout from sexual assault allegations levelled at Fournier Beaudry’s boyfriend and former ice dance partner, while Cizeron is the subject of allegations of abusive conduct from his erstwhile skating partner.Nikolaj Sørensen, a 36-year-old Danish-Canadian ice dancer who is dating Fournier Beaudry, was banned by the Canadian skating governing body for at least six years in 2024 for “sexual maltreatment” related to allegations that he sexually assaulted an American coach and former skater in 2012. He denied the accusations and the suspension wasoverturned in 2025on a technicality relating to questions of jurisdiction.Winter Olympics 2026: Ukrainian athlete kicked out over helmet tribute, Lollobrigida claims dramatic speed skating gold – liveRead moreFournier Beaudry has consistently defended Sorensen. They began skating together in 2012 and started dating the following year. In a recent Netflix documentary series, Glitter & Gold, she said felt like “collateral damage”.She added: “When they decided to suspend him, it meant that his career was over, which also meant that my career was over … This was extremely difficult because it was not only about skating, it was about my integrity, it was about his integrity. I know my boyfriend 100%. I know him. And we [stood] strong together.”The 31-year-old Cizeron has been accused of inappropriate behaviour by the French ice dancer Gabriella Papadakis. On the ice together since they were 10, the pair won gold in Beijing in 2022. But in amemoirreleased last month in France, So as Not to Disappear, Papadakis described Cizeron as “often controlling, demanding and critical” and said she refused to skate with him unless a coach was present. Sheaccusedhim of “blood-chilling coldness” and said she was “terrified by the idea of finding myself alone with him”. Cizeron strongly rejected the claims, lamenting what he called a “smear campaign” and reportedly issuing a cease-and-desist letter.View image in fullscreenMadison Chock and Evan Bates, the reigning three-time world champions, narrowly missed out on their second Olympic gold.Photograph: Wu Hao/EPAPapadakis, who retired in December 2024, was dropped as a broadcaster by NBC last month after the book’s publication. The networktold the Athleticthat the circumstances made it impossible to guarantee that her commentary would be “free of bias – whether actual or perceived”.The allegations have made for an uneasy atmosphere in Italy. In the Netflix series, the former US Olympian turned media analyst Adam Rippon described the Fournier Beaudry-Cizeron partnership as possessing “sinister energy”. Born in Montreal, Fournier Beaudry represented Canada and Denmark before switching her allegiance to France and making her international competitive debut with Cizeron last October. The 33-year-old was granted French citizenship three months ago.In Milan the French pair, who also won a European Championships title in Sheffield last month, sought to deflect questions about the disputes, insisting they wanted to focus on their skating and exude “gratefulness”. But the woman who accused Sørensen of sexual assault said in astatementto the Canadian Press earlier this month that Fournier Beaudry’s defence of Sørensen fosters “a dangerous environment for skaters who need to report abuse … [and] further enforces the culture of silence in figure skating.”Fear and Gibson suffer nightmare on ice as GB Winter Olympic medal drought goes onRead moreMeanwhile, Chock and Bates, much-garlandedveteransin their fourth Olympics who married in 2024, were emotional after an outcome that Chock described as “bittersweet”. The pair, and many observers, felt their strong routine to a version of the Rolling Stones’ Paint It Black wasworthy of gold. However, the judges’ decision saw them awarded silver, only 1.43 points behind the French pair (who skated to saturnine music from the film The Whale) and ahead of the bronze-winning Canadians, Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier.“All four performances we had here at the Olympics, we’re very proud of,” Chocktold reporters. “They were flawless for us. We couldn’t have skated any better, and we’re super proud with how we took the ice, how we handled ourselves every time.

However, there was some consolation: her boyfriend, Connor Watkins, proposed to her near the finish line. Surrounded by members of the US Ski Team, Johnson said “Yes!” and the two embraced.Johnson said she had an idea Watkins would propose, although the exact location and timing was still a surprise. “I had told him that I always dreamed of getting proposed to at the Olympics, so I had an inkling,” Johnson said. “It felt fitting to kind of combine two of my loves. And I don’t know, it’s a special place at the Olympics. I feel like there’s a lot of mystique around it. And also you get free photography.”The couple met on a dating app and Watkins, who works in construction, said he initially had no idea who Johnson was. “I was a little taken aback. I had very little knowledge of ski racing and everything else,” said Watkins.Johnson said she was delighted to be leaving the Olympics with a ring and a medal. “I mean, who doesn’t want to leave with a couple pieces of metal?” she said.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsSkiingUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Exactly 21 minutes before the men’s skeleton was scheduled to begin the International Olympic Committee put out its press release announcing that ithad revoked the Olympic accreditation of the Ukrainian slider Vladyslav Heraskevychafter he refused to compete without his helmet decorated with the images of his fellow athletes who have been killed during the Russian invasion of his country. It was so late the two British competitors, Matt Weston and Marcus Wyatt said they didn’t even find out about it until after they had finished.By then, the news had already spread around the world, and the one Ukrainian journalist present, Stanislav Oroshkevych, from tribuna.com, found he was suddenly surrounded by colleagues from Germany, Britain, Japan, and a dozen other countries, all asking him for public comment on what was going on. Soon, the Ukrainian press attache arrived to save him and announced that Heraskevych would come to give an impromptu press conference himself. The photos of Heraskevych standing behind the barriers near the finish, his helmet tucked under his arm, addressing a crowd of 30 journalists, will be one of the iconic images of these Olympics.‘It’s emptiness’: banned Ukrainian athlete accuses IOC of fuelling Russia’s propagandaRead moreBy then the race was underway, so Heraskevych had to speak over the sound of the roaring crowd, and of his fellow sledders as they came hurtling towards the finish. The media still had their backs to the action on the track.Weston turned in back-to-back track records, 56.21sec, and 55.88sec, and he has a lead of three-tenths of a second over Germany’s Axel Jungk, who won the silver medal in Beijing four years ago. He couldn’t be better placed to win Great Britain a much sought-after medal ahead of the final two heats on Friday evening.“There’s still things that I can improve on, which I think is an extremely lucky and fortunate place to be,” said Weston. “The fact that I want to improve, I want to chase, there’s still things that I can get time out of. There’s definitely some bits to clean up, and that is a great place to be.”Weston is pretty close to Heraskevych. “I chat to him all the time,” he said. “He’s a big personality within the circuit.” And while he said he didn’t want to be drawn into the rights and wrongs of the IOC’s decision, he felt for him on a personal level. “I’m really, really sad that he’s missed out on being able to compete. I think that’s gutting. He’d been sliding really, really well in training and I think he was going to put down some really, really good results. So I’m sad he didn’t get to race.” A lot of the other racers said similar things.“He’s a man with strong values, and I have a lot of respect for that,” said Israel’s Jared Firestone. “Hearing about it beforehand made me feel emotional for him, but ultimately it’s not our decision.”“He stands on whatever he believes in, and that’s something that we see from him year after year,” said the USA’s Daniel Barefoot. “So when I heard that he was going to be trying the helmet no matter what, I was like: ‘He’s telling the truth, he’s not going to back off on race day.’ I was thinking that maybe they would let him do it. When I found out that he was immediately disqualified, I was shocked. It’s sad. He’s one of the best sliders in the world and obviously he believed that that was a more important cause than sliding.”View image in fullscreenVladyslav Heraskevych talked to the press while the skeleton race was in progress.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHeraskevych said that the Latvian team had also offered him their support by lodging an official protest to the IOC. “I know what’s happening and I’m really disappointed with the IOC’s decision,” said their sledder Emils Indriksons. “It’s so sad that this is happening, you should be able to express yourself how you want, and I don’t think that Heraskevych crossed any lines.”Heraskevych will live with the fallout from this and has appealed his case with the court of arbitration for sport on Thursday night, but of course the thoughts of Indriksons, Barefoot, Weston, and all the rest of them will soon move on.There are two races left to go, and three medals to be won. There were dozens of British fans watching, dozens of Germans cheering loudly for Jungk, too, and just the one small band of Ukrainians, a family who had come to support Heraskevych. They had bought an enormous Ukrainian flag with them. The IOC’s stewards had told them to take it down because it was so big they were worried it was going to obscure the view of anyone who wanted to concentrate on the sport.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsInternational Olympic CommitteenewsShareReuse this content"

But having seen their lead at the top whittled down to three points since the weekend, Mikel Arteta’s side showed their fallibility as they were held by a dogged Brentford side who felt that they should have even claimed victory.Just when they needed to put in a statement performance,Arsenalwere edgy throughout and struggled to create anything of note until Noni Madueke opened the scoring. Keane Lewis-Potter’s equaliser that came from a Michael Kayode long throw was fully deserved as Keith Andrews’ side showed exactly why they are enjoying such a successful season since he stepped up to replace Thomas Frank last summer.Brentford v Arsenal: Premier League – liveRead moreHad Igor Thiago not blazed over in injury-time after Cristhian Mosquera and then Declan Rice had both made last-ditch tackles, it could have been even worse for Arsenal. Gabriel Martinelli could also have won it late on but he was denied by a diving save from Caoimhín Kelleher. After three successive runner-up finishes, it promises to be an anxiety-filled run-in for their long-suffering supporters.Arteta had insisted before kickoff that his players would be able to shut out the noise despite City – as Pep Guardiola has put it – now breathing down their necks aftertheir win over Fulhamon Wednesday night. “For seven months we have been doing that. We are used to it,” said the Arsenal manager.But the absences of William Saliba and Kai Havertz due to illness and a muscle injury that the Germany forward picked up in thewin over Sunderlandproved to be vital as Arteta’s side looked jittery in defence and lacked creativity in attack. Eberechi Eze, who started for the first time in the Premier League for two months, looks a shadow of the player whoscored a hat-trickin the north London derby back in November and was unsurprisingly hooked for Martin Ødegaard at half-time. The England forward’s World Cup hopes are in serious jeopardy.The usually unflappable Gabriel Magalhães betrayed some of Arsenal’s early nerves when he passed the ball straight out for a corner in the third minute. Even at that stage, it looked set to be a battle of the set-pieces given both sides’ excellence in that department. Andrews had promised that his team like to “create chaos” and that was evident from their physical approach to every dead-ball situation in an attempt to unsettle their opponents. The former Republic of Ireland midfielder earned himself an early booking after protesting a decision that went against his side.View image in fullscreenNoni Madueke heads home to give Arsenal the lead at Brentford.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersIt was Gabriel who had the first sight of goal in the 10th minute when his header from a Rice corner was cleared by Sepp van den Berg. Brentford’s first opportunity came when David Raya gifted possession to Mathias Jensen as he attempted to launch a quick break. The Dane’s cross picked out Igor Thiago perfectly but somehow Raya was able to redeem himself against his former club by making a tremendous point-blank save.Brentford visibly grew in confidence and started to enjoy more possession, with Eze struggling to have an impact in his No 10 role. Viktor Gyökeres was full of energy but found himself isolated as Arsenal’s attacks lacked urgency. Arteta showed his frustration when Martín Zubimendi gave the ball away cheaply five minutes before half-time, although at least Arsenal started to look more threatening before the break. Chances were few and far between, however, with a shanked effort from Lewis-Potter summing up the quality on show.There was a heart-stopping moment for Arsenal at the start of the second half when Lewis-Potter jinked his way past Jurriën Timber and it required a timely intervention from Gabriel to block Igor Thiago’s shot. They continued to pen Brentford back but still hadn’t managed a shot on target after an hour, with a strike from Ødegaard sailing into the stands. “Top of the league, you’re having a laugh,” mocked the Brentford fans.Their jeers were silenced less than a minute later when Madueke – not exactly renowned for his heading ability – rose to meet Piero Hincapié’s excellent cross and directed his header across a helpless Kelleher. Lewis-Potter should have equalised almost immediately from a corner but headed wide as the game finally came alive. Kayode pinched the ball off Gyökeres’ toe just as he was about to score before Raya saved from Igor Thiago at the other end. Gabriel – having escaped being sent off when he chopped down Dango Ouattara after picking up an early yellow card – brilliantly blocked a shot from the marauding Kayode.Fittingly, it was the Italian’s long throw that caused panic in the Arsenal penalty area and allowed Lewis-Potter to equalise after Van den Berg’s flick-on that would have done a certain Steve Bould proud. “Set-piece FC,” sang the jubilant Brentford fans as Arsenal’s were left to fret over whether this could end up being yet another season with a disappointing twist in the tale.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrentfordArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The alleged offences are said to have taken place in 2021 and 2022 when he was an Arsenal player.Partey pleaded not guilty to all those charges at Southwark crown court in September, where a trial date was set for 2 November 2026.Partey’s defence lawyer, Jenny Wiltshire, said: “Thomas Partey continues to deny all charges against him. He has cooperated with the police throughout. Given there are ongoing legal proceedings, there will be no further comment.”Partey was granted bail in relation to the initial charges on the same conditions he had previously been placed under, including that he cannot make contact with any of the three alleged victims and must inform police of any permanent changes of address or international travel.Partey was first charged in July four days after leaving Arsenal, who he joined in 2020. He has played 21 times for Villarreal this season and has continued playing for Ghana, making his most recent international appearance in a World Cup qualifier against Comoros in October 2025. Ghana have qualified for the World Cup.Explore more on these topicsFootballnewsShareReuse this content"

I can understand it with the number of storms they had ... but I did think it affected the football. I thought we were ruthless. The three goals were fantastic. I felt like our defending as a whole team was excellent.”Arsenal take giant stride towards WCL last eight with thumping win over LeuvenRead moreThese two are familiar opponents, having met in Madrid back in October in the league phase. United came out with a 1-0 win on that occasion in an eventful encounter in which both sides were reduced to 10 players.Since then, their fortunes have diverged. Skinner’s side are in strong form that has taken them to second place in the Women’s Super League and to their first League Cup final.For Atlético, things have been less rosy. They have had an inconsistent season in Liga F and they now sit fifth. Poor results led to the replacement of Victor Martín with José Herrera in late January. In the three matches since, the manager has implemented a change to a back three and they earned their first win in seven against Levante last weekend.Herrera named an unchanged lineup from that win. They were without the electric midfielder Luany due to suspension while the new arrivals Priscila Chinchilla and Kathrine Møller Kühl were on the bench.View image in fullscreenElisabeth Terland (right) mimes a haircut in celebration as she savours her early goal with Maya Le Tissier.Photograph: Poppy Townson/MUFC/Manchester United/Getty ImagesIn contrast, Skinner made three changes from Saturday’s victory over Leicester. With three goals in her past four matches, the clinical Terland returned, while Ellen Wangerheim was handed her first Champions League start in a United shirt.Atlético’s Fiamma Benítez had said pre-match that Madrid would need to cut out mistakes but a big error within three minutes put them on the back foot. Vilde Bøe Risa handed her former side a gift with a pass straight to Malard. The France international spotted the run of Terland and the Norwegian duly converted.“You can put two goalkeepers in front of her finish and they wouldn’t have saved it,” Skinner said. “It was that good. Teri is one of the best finishers that I have ever worked with. She worked tirelessly.

There are certainly plenty of contenders but as North Yorkshire erupted in joy on the night rugby league’s big show rolled into town for the first time, it was hard to think of anything that measured up to this.Super League’s decision to expand to 14 teams over the winter has drawn criticism, not least over concerns that the two extra sides may not have brought the sufficient quality to compete at the highest level. Yet York managed not only to get off the mark but to stun the defending, all-conquering treble winners of 2025.Super League 2026: team-by-team guide to the new seasonRead moreHull KR lost only five games in all competitions last season. Here, they have fallen at the first hurdle, having asked Super League for a softer opening game in anticipation of next week’s World Club Challenge against NRL champions Brisbane Broncos. To suggest it was ideal preparation would be quite the understatement.But for once, this night is not about the Robins. This is about York, Super League’s newest expansion project – and a night which shows there is a vibrant future in this part of the world for rugby league. Many of the full house of almost 9,000 were scarcely able to believe what they had seen.York, a part-time side as recently as four months ago, and not seen in the sport’s top flight since the 1980s, were not just underdogs here. They were huge outsiders and it looked as though it would go according to script as the Robins battled into an 18-6 lead with 20 minutes left. But the contest swung on an extraordinary moment when Hull KR and England half-back Mikey Lewis tripped his opposite number, Liam Harris, for no reason. By the time he returned from the sin bin, York had scored through Sam Wood and shortly after, with the momentum behind them, they levelled courtesy of Scott Galeano’s try, with Harris – released by Hull KR as a teenager – converting both.The drama didn’t end there. With the crowd roaring them on and the atmosphere incredible, Harris supplied a pass for Ata ­Hingano, who kicked a drop goal to clinch victory and spark incredible scenes.View image in fullscreenJai Whitbread scores his second try to put Hull KR ahead in the second half.Photograph: George Wood/Getty Images“I’d be lying if I said some of the lads hadn’t read it [Hull KR asking for an easier opener] and it’s not put a few backs up,” York’s victorious coach, Mark Applegarth, said. “But we’re focusing on us. I’m so proud of the lads first and foremost. “York is the right place for the game to expand into and this has shown it.”York more than played their part in a thrilling first half, with the two sides level at half-time. Wood opened the scoring with a well-worked try before Rovers responded through Jai Whitbread’s first of the evening. Harris kicked a penalty to make it 6-6 at the break, but you always wondered if Rovers’ class would come through.That looked to be the case as the second half began. Two tries in eight minutes, one for Whitbread and another for Sauaso Sue, made it 18-6 and suddenly, it seemed as though York’s spirit had been broken. You could almost feel the atmosphere deflate inside the stadium.It made Lewis’s moment of madness all the more critical. “He needs to learn from what he did and he needs to action it,” Hull KR’s coach, Willie Peters, said. “Whatever you call it, a brain explosion or what, he’s the only one that can tell you what happened at the time. We didn’t handle it well.”York could suddenly sense an opportunity. Wood claimed his second before, with Rovers still adjusting after Lewis’s return, they worked left for Galeano to mark his Super League debut with a try. Harris’s two goals made it 18-18 but the Knights still had one more magical moment in them, with Hingano sending the home support wild.York had made no secret of the fact that they hoped this night, welcoming the reigning champions, would convince the North Yorkshire public there is a future for Super League in York.

A biblical storm blew through the Metropolitano, leaving Barcelona in pieces andAtlético Madridcloser to a first Copa del Rey final in 13 years. “I’m not a wizard but I did believe that the team could play like this,” Simeone said at the end of a wild night, yet even he could not have imagined anything quite like this, 45 extraordinary minutes giving his team a 4-0 lead to take to the Camp Nou in three weeks’ time.“This will remain in the memory however the tie ends,” Simeone said, careful to note that this is not over yet. Hansi Flick, meanwhile, vowed that hisBarcelonateam will fight, claimed they had been handed a “great lesson” that might yet be helpful, and outlined a plan for the second leg: 2-0 in each half. But an an own goal from Eric García and three more before half-time here from Ademola Lookman, Antoine Griezmann and Julián Alvarez, did the kind of damage that will be mightily difficult to fix. Barcelona could not begin that task here, a Pau Cubarsí effort ruled out after a seven-minute VAR check the only “goal” of the second half. Indeed, another VAR check made their second leg task even harder when Eric García was sent off in the final minutes.‘His holiness’ Santi Cazorla leads the way as Oviedo find relief … and belief | Sid LoweRead moreEnough had happened in the first half for an entire tie. “There was an incredible energy in the stadium and life is energy,” Simeone said, his side going at Barcelona from the start. The first foul, on 30 seconds, was a fuse lit. Giuliano Simeone flew into Alejandro Balde and his teammates followed, a perfect storm unleashed that Barcelona could not escape. For 45 frantic, breathless minutes in which Flick’s team didn’t know which way to turn, Atlético Madrid ripped into them, leaving no place to take shelter and scoring four goals that genuinely should have been more.It may sound absurd to say that the opening goal was coming when it came on just six minutes, and via an own goal, but that was how it felt here and that feeling never went away. Jules Koundé had already had to move fast to stop Alvarez getting in and Joan García had saved from Giuliano Simeone inside two minutes, Griezmann’s gorgeous cushioned pass into him then just the first brushstroke of what was becoming a masterpiece. And although that opening goal was ridiculous, Eric García’s back pass slipping under Joan García’s foot and over the line, Atlético didn’t stop there.The smell of blood was too strong for that. Atlético streamed into the wide space beyond Barcelona’s high line, screeched into every tackle, first to every ball. Barcelona were caught in the vortex, a nightmare, trapped on the page of a Where’s Wally: everywhere they looked, there was a red and white shirt.On the left, Lookman flew past them. On the right Simeone, a neck-bulging, leg-whirring, heart-thumping Tasmanian devil of a footballer, flew past them. The right-back, Nahuel Molina bombing in from behind, flew past them too. Left-back Matteo Ruggeri resisted the urge to run, and instead successfully denied Lamine Yamal any place to play. Koke and Marcos Llorente, a man with the legs and lungs of 11 men, dominated the middle. Alvarez was … well, Barcelona didn’t knowwherehe was. Griezmann made it all make sense, subtle in the storm, as if conducting it.He also scored the second after just 13 minutes. As if to underline how complete Atlético were, the goal started with goalkeeper Juan Musso delivering a fabulous pass to Lookman on the left. Lookman found Alvarez, who speared ball rightwards. Molina slipped it in to Griezmann to score. Simeone turned to the supporters, demanding they play their part which they did, never falling silent, not even when Fermín López hit the bar soon after. They were the soundtrack, the rolling thunder in a storm which kept on coming.View image in fullscreenEric García (right) is shown a yellow card for fouling Álex Baena, which was later upgraded to a red.Photograph: Óscar del Pozo/AFP/Getty ImagesGriezmann might have taken more time over a chance made by Lookman and Llorente, but only 30 seconds later he and Molina made another clear opportunity for Alvarez which Koundé cleared off the line. Twenty-two minutes in and it was Atlético’s sixth shot, all clear sights of goal. From their seventh, a couple of minutes later, Griezmann struck over. Again, Giuliano Simeone had raced free into space. The next time he flew up the right, Griezmann opening the cage and setting him free again, they scored their third. Lookman provided the finish this time.Flick took off Marc Casadó, pulling him close to offer an explanation. Casadó had been booked for desperately taking down Giuliano who was escaping again and, besides, Barcelona had to do something,anything. But although López got in soon after, Musso saved that and Atlético immediately went back at them, extending a lead that was already barely believable. Ripping Barcelona’s left side open yet again, this time it was Molina who started it, Lookman laying off for Alvarez to hit a perfect finish that was a release too, the ball taking all his troubles with it.Under pressure and out of form of late, Alvarez had needed this. They all had. On the touchline, Simeone Sr set off on a sprint, his head in his hands. Alvarez closed his eyes and pointed skywards, liberated. Koke screamed. All over the place, players ran, roaring. It wasn’t over, the tie not even a quarter done, but it felt that way, the unimaginable suddenly real, faith restored. “The people need a night like this,” Simeone said.Explore more on these topicsCopa del ReyAtlético MadridBarcelonaEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Others who have followed it more closely can doNottingham Forest and their 4 (four) managers. This is a piece about Tottenham Hotspur, or as I like to call them, my big team who win things.November 2023 feels like a lifetime ago. Spurs were top of the league. Angeball was at its peak. Dynamic free-flowing football – they were 1-0 up against Chelsea thanks to Dejan Kulusevski (injured). It’s the 14th minute, Spurs neatly play themselves out from the back down the right, it breaks to Pape Sarr who rolls the ball to Destiny Udogie (injured), and Brennan Johnson (Crystal Palace) steams down the left. He plays a perfect first-time ball with his left foot into the path of Son Heung-min (LAFC), who rolls it home. Tottenham are 2-0 up against a team they lose to at least twice a season.What if Son hadn’t been a quarter of a yard offside? Is that the sliding door? Do Spurs just go the season unbeaten? Postecoglou begins an extraordinary dynasty.Thomas Frankhas Brentford ninth still. Mikel Arteta gets sacked for losing the title to his bitter rivals. The Premier League and Manchester City resolve the 100‑plus charges. VAR is abolished. Kamala Harris wins the US election.Ange Postecoglou claims Tottenham are ‘not a big club’ in damning assessmentRead moreAs it happens, the goal is ruled out, Cristian Romero (suspended) does one of his trademark get-the-ball-kill-the-opponent challenges in the box and is sent off. Udogie follows him down the tunnel. James Maddison (injured) gets injured. Eric Dier (Monaco) is in the middle of the highest of high lines. Unbelievably, Spurs have a couple of chances to make it 2-2 with nine men. ButChelsea run away with itand Angeball never quite recovers.I was the last person on the sinking Postecoglou Titanic, there with the string quartet playing Men at Work and John Farnham. We’re all someone’s daughter … we’re all someone’s son. Partly, after working in football in Australia for three years, I’d been brainwashed by Mark Bosnich and everyone in the game here. Their pride in Postecoglou’s achievements is a beautiful thing.It was romance and vibes. Spurs did a kit reveal some time after the Europa League win, and I was just waiting for Postecoglou to pop up at the end and say: “Get ready for season three, mate.” But by the end it was hard to cling on to the big Ange lifeboat.There are people in Australia who believe the treatment of Postecoglou was markedly different to that of Frank, and they may have a point. Both had debilitatingly long lists of injured players, and there were certainly fewer parody Danish accents doing the rounds; maybe Frank is just a less meme-able guy.WhenFrank arrived from Brentford, it felt very sensible. There was optimismafter the Super Cup. A manager who sets up defensively against a better opponent. Kevin Danso hurling some long throws into the box. Praise be, he’s adaptable! And despite “Here we don’t go, Eze and Gibbs-White” there wasthe win at Manchester City.Third place after seven games. But since then, only Burnley and Wolves have picked up fewer points, the home form is disastrous. Of all the fatal errors, saying that paying supporters “can’t be real Tottenham fans” for booing duringthe defeat to Fulham, felt seriously unwise at the time, however you feel about fans turning on their own during a game. It has been bleak and boring. To dare is to play João Palhinha and Rodrigo Bentancur in a double pivot. To dare is to rely solely on Danso long throws.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank desperately tries to stop the Spurs rot against Newcastle.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPALast season was a good season to have a bad season: Spurs were never in danger of relegation because the bottom three were so poor. Postecoglou could prioritise Europe. You get the impression that Spurs would have stuck with Frank if relegation wasn’t a real possibility. But it is a real possibility, and who sees Spurs dominating in the Championship? Who’s rolling up their sleeves at Deepdale or the Den, presuming neither Preston nor Millwall come up?There is the quite real possibility that Postecoglou wasn’t good enough, and neither was Frank. There’s an excellent four-minute clip online about the life of a Brentford manager. Uwe Rösler, Mark Warburton, Dean Smith, Frank, normally hired from within with little experience, then move somewhere bigger and fail. Someone should play it to Keith Andrews and tell him to stay put for as long as he can.Recent stories coming out of Spurs suggest Frank thought only Pedro Porro was an elite player. Hopefully he didn’t let everyone know. “Lads, gather round, I’m not having any of you.”But was he right? Is Guglielmo Vicario good? He wouldn’t start for most Premier League teams. Romero and Micky van de Ven are regarded as one of the best defensive partnerships in the division, but Spurs lose regularly when they’re both there. The midfield runs around, which is part of it, but what happens when they get the ball? A series of random attackers just doing their own thing. Richarlison bulletting around, Randal Kolo Muani not quite holding it up, not quite getting in behind. Wilson Odobert doing some stepovers here, Mathys Tel doing some over there.There are clearly many mitigating factors for Postecoglou and Frank and probably every Spurs manager in recent history, butthe Newcastle game was so bad, against a team who are also struggling and also have injuries. And while there was romance with Ange, and there was sometimes good football, there never was with Frank – just a seemingly lovely guy, who now gets millions of pounds for doing a really bad job, however unlucky he may have been.One fan suggested he wouldn’t get his hair cut until Spurs won one game in a row, another said he would wait until they completed five successive passes. Hard to know which will come sooner. It may be cathartic to ring a phone-in and demand a “complete clearout” from top to bottom, and maybe none of the players, coaches, directors, owners are good enough, but that leaves a phoenix club five points from safety and in the last 16 of the Champions League.Do they go full Manchester United and look for some DNA? Manchester United DNA is Fergie and injury-time goals, trophies and success, while Spurs DNA is Sissoko’s handball, lasagne and Dr Tottenham.They probably need three or four wins from the last 12 games to stay up. Vibes can probably do that. So stick Harry Redknapp, Glenn Hoddle, Teddy Sheringham, Jermain Defoe and Gary Doherty in those big blue chairs for the north London derby, close your eyes and just hope. Or maybe call Postecoglou? Is that the twist in season three?Mauricio Pochettinoreturns in the summer; break him in 18 months.

For Scotland, last-minute call-ups after the decision tobanish Bangladeshfrom the tournament last month,English travailshave put some extra pep in their step ahead of the now-crucial Group C clash in Kolkata on Saturday.“Definitely,” says the seamer Safyaan Sharif. “They’ll be feeling pressure because they know they have to win if they want to qualify. Obviously that’s the same with us, but I don’t think we have too much to lose. I think they have more to lose than us. Nepal gave them a good run and they were stressed in that game. They were panicking a lot – you could tell, the way they were playing in the final few overs. So it’s how they handle the pressure.The Spin | Aiming for the moon: the rise of the slower ball, from Stephenson to CurranRead more“I know they’ve been playing good cricket, but then Nepal almost beat them, and the West Indies overpowered them towards the back end. Any team is dangerous in the T20 format, and we’re also playing good cricket at the moment. In T20 anyone can beat anyone, and anything can change within one over, or one ball.”The Scots know more than most teams here how quickly things can change in sport. Just a few weeks ago Sharif was expecting to spend his February doing indoor training and helping out at his father’s restaurant in Kirkcaldy. Then the phone rang.“I was just at home, getting some family time, doing some training, and I help my dad out during the winter or when I’m off from cricket – I’m kind of a supervisor, making sure everything is going well, and if they’re a chef short I’ll fill in that role,” Sharif says.“We’d read so much stuff in the media saying Bangladesh might go, they might not go. I thought it was just noise. I was at home when I got the call saying that we’d been invited to India and I’d be going. I was a bit shocked because it was all a bit sudden, and I didn’t think that Bangladesh would pull out, I thought they would resolve something.”Sharif’s Pakistani heritage made his visa application complicated, delaying his arrival in India. The speed of that turnaround means that though this is his sixth World Cup of various flavours, none has quite prepared him for this one. “I got here two days before our first warm-up game. It was a bit of a challenging process,” he adds.“Other World Cups, you know you’re going so you have so much preparation, your mind is set and it does make a big difference, whereas when you just get a call and they say you’re going to the World Cup, it’s obviously exciting and I’m really happy to be selected, but you have to just accept the challenge you have ahead.”View image in fullscreenSafyaan Sharif celebrates after sealing Scotland’s famous win over England in 2018.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersThe 34-year-old struggled in Scotland’s opening fixture, a 35-run defeat to West Indies, and was left out of their second, an emphatic victory over Italy. “I just couldn’t execute the way I wanted to,” he says of the West Indies game. “Obviously that just comes down to being a little bit unprepared. But we’re here to play, we can’t use that as an excuse. Now we’ve been here for a bit of time, we’ve had a few extra sessions, which is what I needed, and I’m looking forward to the big day.”Sharif is Scotland’s fifth most-capped player in Twenty20 internationals, and all of the top six are in a squad that blends youth and experience. All six of those senior players also appeared in perhaps Scotland’s greatest international fixture, the one-day internationalvictory over Englandin 2018 (only Adil Rashid remains for the English). Sharif took one wicket, trapping Mark Wood lbw to win the game.Quick GuideNo love lost: auld rivals meet twice on Valentine’s DayShowIt’s a Valentine’s Day special: Scotland and England meet in different sports 5,000 miles apart today:9.30am GMTScotland v England in Kolkata (cricket)4.40pmGMTScotland v England in Calcutta Cup (rugby union)The historyThe cricketers are meeting in the T20 World Cup at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta – the very Indian city where, in 1878, British expats in the process of disbanding their local rugby club melted down their last 270 silver rupees to form a trophy that they gifted to the RFU. The Calcutta Cup has since been awarded to the winners of the England v Scotland men's rugby international, played annually as part of the Six Nations.The contestsScotland arrive at both matches on the back of an instructive game against Italy. the rugby men fell to a dispiriting 18-15 defeat in Rome last Saturday, while the cricketers beat the Italians by 73 runs on Monday in a match that went to form. England are favourites in both contests today but nothing is certain – their cricketers were taken to the last ball by Nepal and lost to the West Indies, while their rugby union team have lost on their last two trips to Edinburgh.The Valentine’s factorThere’s no love lost when these nations meet, though they have never faced each other in cricket or rugby on 14 February. There is football history on this date though – the Scottish FA’s centenary match in 1973. Bobby Moore captained England in a 5-0 Hampden win over a side featuring Kenny Dalglish and George Graham, skippered by Billy Bremner. Warning: love may be tested in households where watching cricket all morning and rugby for most of the afternoon is not seen as the optimal Valentine’s Day by both partners.The outcomeIn both instances a Scotland win would serve the tournament better – the Six Nations desperately needs a revitalised Scottish team, while a theme of cricket’s expansive T20 World Cup is the growth of the associate nations. But with Phil Salt opening England’s batting in Kolkata and Guy Pepper in the English pack at Murrayfield, there is an outcome that would give extra flavour to a day of sporting coincidences: double England glory ... led by Salt and Pepper.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I have no words. It was a fantastic feeling,” he remembers. “In my head I was like, I just need to bowl my best ball, which is the yorker, which I’ve been nailing for so many years. But the previous over I’d been trying to nail that ball and I wasn’t quite executing it. When it came to the big moment I approached the crease, I jumped and I released the ball, and it just felt really good when it came out of my hand. I was like, ‘Yeah, this is the ball.’”It is the only time he has faced England. He has played 76 T20s against 24 opponents, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, but Saturday brings the chance to add one more name to that list. “It’s always good to play against England, because you’re playing against some of the top players in the world,” he says. “Whether it’s bowling, batting, all-rounders, they have it all. So it’s a good exciting challenge.“But the guys are on form, the batting group is doing really well. This is why you want to be here, to put in performances and showcase your talent. And we’re going to keep doing that and hopefully, when it comes to England, we do the exact same thing: play to our strengths, play our best cricket, and hopefully we’re on the winning side.”Explore more on these topicsScotland Cricket TeamT20 World Cup 2026England cricket teamT20 World CupTwenty20CricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

England have not won at Murrayfield since 2020, however, and only once since 2016 with Russell proving their nemesis on several occasions.Gregor Townsend warns England not to underestimate wounded ScotlandRead moreThe 33-year-old orchestrated the Lions’ series victory over the Wallabies last summer with Wigglesworth one of Andy Farrell’s right-hand men on the coaching staff and he has conceded coming up with a specific plan to stop Russell is a bootless errand.“How many defence coaches have gone in with a Finn Russell plan and been made to look pretty stupid?” said Wigglesworth. “It’s not something we’ve done in that regard, it’s more: how do we stop Scotland and what they can do? Because we know the dangers they have out wide and what the guys in the middle produce for them.“He’s one of those guys whose talent speaks for itself but he works hard on it. I found him really diligent. Obviously his mind works really fast. You tell him something or there’s some part of a plan he just picks up and goes with it. All the stuff you expect with the standard of player he is. He’s always a personable bloke so you can have those chats with him. I probably got to see more of it, up close.”The England flanker Sam Underhill has pointed to Russell’s defensive mettle as well as his attacking attributes, revealing he has thought better of putting one of his trademark tackles on the Scot in Bath training. “He’s far too expensive to do that,” Underhill said. “He’s a physical 10, as well, which is probably an underrated part of his game. He’s a good defender, he’s a good hitter, and he’s not a small guy. I don’t want to big him up too much but he’s a fairly well rounded player.“He’s a very talented rugby player. He’s a very confident player. That’s probably one of his strengths – he’s pretty unflappable. I’ve got a lot of respect for the guy and enjoy playing with him.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026England rugby union teamScotland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

It means making hard choices about force structure, readiness, stockpiles and industrial capacity that reflect the realities of modern conflict rather than peacetime politics,” Colby toldNatoallies on Thursday.Last summer, Nato European membersagreed to increasecore defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2035 to reach US levels, but it is unclear what this increased militarisation will mean in practice.Colby’s comments were made behind closed doors in a short speech to Nato’s 31 other members, at the start of a meeting of alliance defence ministers in Brussels. Unusually, they were released by the Pentagon shortly after delivery.Though he emphasised that the US would continue to provide an “extended nuclear deterrent”, he said Washington’s forces – currently numbering about 85,000 in Europe – would be deployed “in a more limited and focused fashion”.The undersecretary is one of the most vocal proponents in the Trump administration of shifting US military attention away from Europe. The “most consequential” interests for the US were in deterring China and in the Americas, he said, while Europe would have to take “the lead for its conventional defence”.However, Colby also made clear the US “will continue to ready our forces to do our part” under Nato’s article 5, which states that an attack on one ally is considered an attack on all – a pledge that has at times been questioned by Trump.Last month the US president made repeated efforts to force Denmark into handing over Greenland, with the White House at times indicating that it would not rule out using military force to capture the Arctic territory from its Nato ally.Mark Rutte, Nato’s secretary general, sought to move on from the unprecedented row, arguing that an alliance of democracies would always have “debates and discussions”, and he said Colby’s remarks showed that the US was “anchored in Nato”.“The good news is that this alliance always finds a way forward, to come together, to focus again on our overarching goal, which is to keep 1 billion people safe,” Rutte said, arguing that article 5 remained intact.Though the decision to send Colby instead of Hegseth was a clear attempt to demonstrate that Nato had reduced significance for the US, European diplomats insisted he was still an important figure, close to the vice-president, JD Vance.In December, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, skipped a meeting of Nato foreign ministers and sent the deputy secretary Christopher Landau instead. After addressing counterparts in Brussels, Landau left the meeting early.Colby stayed for the entirety of the three-hour meeting on Thursday, listening to the other 31 defence ministers each giving speeches of up to three minutes in length. It was taken as sign of respect to Nato members.Ukraine’s allies committed $35bn in military aid this year following the Nato defence ministers meeting, according to UK defence secretary John Healey. Pledges were made at a meeting of the Ukraine contact group, a group of 50 countries, which came in the afternoon after the Nato session.Explore more on these topicsNatoEuropeUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The Tories have had three women prime ministers and four leaders and we’ve had none. I think Angela Rayner is a credible figure. I think some women MPs are making a lot of noise around there needs to be awoman deputy, but if they’re serious about that, they need to put their money where their mouth is and support Angela Rayner.”She said she feltLabourwas likely to lose the Gorton and Denton byelection later this month and that Starmer should step down as a result.“It’s not as simple as one dodgy appointment,” she said, referring to theappointment of Peter Mandelsonas US ambassador last year. “It’s a series of poor political judgments.

Angela has been clear Labour must come together, avoid distraction and work as a team to deliver for the public.”Starmer has attempted to restore unity in his fractured party after a week in which he haslost his chief of staff,his communications directorandbeen denouncedby the Labour leader in Scotland.He managed to secure the backing of the cabinet on Monday afternoon after Anas Sarwar, who wants to become Scottish first minister at May’s elections, said he had no confidence in the prime minister.Officials in Downing Street feared Sarwar’s comments could prompt a widespread coup attempt but were relieved when every key Labour figure in Westminster – including Rayner – publicised their support for the prime minister.Many in the party still believe, however, that Starmer is likely to face a leadership challenge before long, potentially after the byelection or the local elections in May.Several allies of Wes Streeting said this week that they expected the health secretary to challenge the prime minister in the aftermath of the local elections if not before. Streeting has denied he is planning to do this.Rayner, meanwhile, put further pressure on Starmer on Thursday to reduce taxes on the hospitality industry. “Customers just aren’t there in the way they used to be as business rates remain punishingly high, energy bills soar and costs in your supply chains and VAT bite,” she told an event in Liverpool. “We need to recognise that hospitality and nightlife require extended support – not handouts.”Eslamdoust originally called for Starmer to step down on Monday, becoming one of two Labour-affiliated general secretaries to advocate publicly for a change in leadership, alongside Steve Wright, the head of the Fire Brigades Union.Chris Wormald forced out by Starmer as cabinet secretaryRead moreThere are 11 unions affiliated with the party in total, of which the TSSA, which donated about £30,000 to the party last year, is one of the smallest.Eslamdoust, who once advised the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, said she wanted Rayner to take the party to the left, including with stronger protections for workers rights and nationalisations in the rail, water and energy industries.A Downing Street spokesperson said: “Keir Starmer is one of only four Labour leaders ever to have won a general election. He has a clear five-year mandate from the British people to deliver change and that is what he will do.”Eslamdoust’s backing of Rayner kickstarts what is likely to be a struggle between her and Streeting to secure more union backing. While Rayner has won the support of many union leaders with her employment rights agenda, she has alsoangered Unite, one of the biggest unions in the country, with her opposition to theBirmingham bin strikes.Explore more on these topicsLabour party leadershipAngela RaynerKeir StarmerLabourTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Since launching All Red All Equal in 2016, we have embedded equality, diversity and inclusion into everything we do. We remain deeply committed to the principles and spirit of that campaign.”In an interview with Sky News on Wednesday, Ratcliffe took aim at people receiving state support and immigrants. “You can’t afford … you can’t have an economy with 9 million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in,” he said. “The UK is being colonised by immigrants, really, isn’t it?”Ratcliffe also cited incorrect figures concerning the UK’s population. Football organisations have joined politicians and other public figures in condemning his comments and their tone. On Thursday Ratcliffe said he was sorry that his “choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe”.An earlier statement from Show Racism the Red Card said: “Language of this kind echoes narratives that have historically been used to stigmatise migrant communities, fuel division, and legitimise hostility towards minority groups. Club influence should be used to challenge racism, not inadvertently amplify narratives that undermine community harmony.”Kick it Out, the anti-discrimination body, described Ratcliffe’s words as “disgraceful and deeply divisive”. In a statement, it said: “In addition to the inaccurate figures mentioned, it’s worth reminding him that Manchester United has a diverse fanbase and plays in a city whose cultural history has been enriched by immigrants. This type of language and leadership has no place in English football, and we believe most fans will feel the same.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Manchester United Muslim Supporters Club also criticised Ratcliffe. “Manchester United is a global club built on diversity – on players, staff and supporters from every background, faith and ethnicity,” it said in a statement. “The strength of our club, and of our country, lies in that diversity. We stand with all communities who reject racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia and hatred in all its forms, and we call for leadership that unites rather than divides.”Ratcliffe’s handling of United, who are fourth in the Premier League, has drawn fierce criticism from fans. Their high-profile appointment of Ruben Amorim as head coach was a failure and the team are being led by Michael Carrick until the end of the season.In a statement, the United supporters’ group the 1958 criticised Ratcliffe’s intervention and his decision to comment “on the issues of our country while living in Monaco to avoid paying tax”.Ratcliffe bought a minority share in United in 2023 and has been labelled an “incompetent clown” by fans over his handling of football operations.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedJim RatcliffeThe FAFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Old-fashioned, dirty political corruption,” said Sheldon Whitehouse, senator for Rhode Island, at the rally. “This is an agency that has been so infiltrated by the corrupt fossil fuel industry that it has turned an agency of government into the weapon of the fossil fuel polluters.”The rescinding of the 2009 endangerment finding will befinalizedby Donald Trump and the EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, on Thursday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters this week. The seminal ruling established the legal basis to regulate planet-warming pollution under the Clean Air Act.The Trump administration has defended its rollbacks of regulations, arguing they can protect the environment while boosting the economy and lowering energy costs.The administration is calling it the “largest deregulatory action in American history” and claims it will save Americans $1.3tn, though did not explain how officials arrived at that number. In an emailed statement, an EPA spokesperson said the endangerment finding was used to “justify trillions of dollars of greenhouse gas regulations covering new vehicles and engines”Experts warn it could incur trillions in climate damages and healthcare costs.How Trump’s promise to slash energy bills in half has failed across the USRead moreAt Wednesday’s gathering, environmental nonprofits including the Natural Resources Defense Council, Earthjustice and Sierra Club pledged to file litigation over the forthcoming rollback.“We’re going to be taking this fight to the courts, and we are going to win,” said Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council.Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts also promised that he and Whitehouse would highlight the issue in the Senate, while the New York member Paul Tonko said he would do the same on the floor of the House.The move comes a year and a half after Trump on the campaign trail reportedlyrequested $1bn from oil bosses, promising he would scrap environmental rules if elected.“[Zeldin] is saying to the fossil fuel industry, you now are gonna get what you paid for,” said Markey at the gathering. “This is cash and carry: you give us the cash, and then we carry away all of the environmental protections.”The plan to kill the endangerment finding was “terrifying”, said Talia Brandt, a 10-year-old Maryland resident and member of environmental health organization Moms Clean Air Force, who appeared at the rally with her mother, Liz.“We shouldn’t have to be here fighting for our future,” she said.The endangerment finding was based on a large body of peer-reviewed research and has repeatedly defended and upheld in federal courts. Since it was codified, the evidence showing greenhouse gas emissions endanger society has only gotten stronger, said Joseph Goffman, former assistant administrator of EPA’s office of air and radiation at EPA.“Science did not change when Donald Trump was inaugurated,” said Goffman, who helped write and implement the Clean Air Act and worked directly on the endangerment finding. “What did change was the arrival of the new EPA management, determined to destroy the agency’s public health and environmental mission.”The forthcoming killing of the endangerment finding comes as part of Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda to deregulate energy and boost fossil fuels. On Wednesday, the presidentsignedan executive order directing the defense department to procure morepower from coal, the most polluting and planet-warming fossil fuel.“Clean, beautiful coal is not only keeping the lights on in our country but also driving down the cost of electricity across the country as well,” Leavitt said on Tuesday.On the same day, the president was awarded the inaugural “Undisputed Champion of Coal” title from the Washington Coal Club – a DC-based pro-coal industry organization – for his efforts to roll back federal climate regulations.“I think Trump’s children and the Trump family will live to be ashamed of that award,” Whitehouse told the Guardian in an interview before the rally.The coal industry poured$3.5minto efforts to elect Trump in 2024. Reports show the president’s efforts to keep ageing coal plants open couldpush up already soaring energy billsnationwide.In an interview with the Guardian, Markey said the Trump administration’s attack on environmental rules – and the opposition to that attack – was “making climate change an issue again” across America.“This is going to put climate change right back on the front burner of American politics,” Markey said. “They’re really going to regret what they’re doing, because the Republicans are going to pay a big political price.”While the “billionaire class” benefits from the rollback of the endangerment finding, vulnerable people will be harmed the most, Manuel Salgado, federal research manager at environmental justice non-profit We Act for Environmental Justice, said at the rally.“These modern-day robber barons would gladly add to their already obscene piles of wealth by making us less safe from climate change,” he said. “We will not let this continue to happen.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDemocracy, climate and justiceClimate crisisUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The extreme weather, which has affected central and southern parts of the country, has cut off power to 33,000 people and caused an estimated €775m (£675m) of damage.View image in fullscreenThe extreme weather has caused the deaths of at least 16 people and destroyed homes and businesses.Photograph: Antonio Pedro Santos/EPAPortugal’s interior minister, Maria Lúcia Amaral, resigned on Tuesday in the face of mounting anger over her handling of the emergency, saying she felt she did not have “the personal and political conditions necessary to carry out her duties”.As the storms rage on, scientists and experts have criticised the country’s unwillingness to adapt to the bouts of extreme weather that have been plaguing the Iberian peninsula in recent years.“We are not prepared for the present climate, much less for the future,” said Pedro Matos Soares, an atmospheric physicist, during a video conference on climate held by the University of Lisbon’s faculty of sciences this week.“Portugal still handles land-use planning thinking about the 19th century or the first half of the 20th century climate. We have to understand what the climate is like now and what it will be like in the future. Otherwise, we’re going to have a problem.”Nuno Martins, a professor of architecture and climate adaptation, said that several of the storms’ victims had died while trying to repair their roofs with donated tarpaulins in central Portugal, while hundreds more had been injured in falls.Martins’s NGO, Building 4Humanity – a team of architects, engineers, and designers – has been volunteering in central Portugal and put together a manual to teach people how to repair their roofs safely.View image in fullscreenVoters travel to a polling station by boat after flooding in the Cartaxo region.Photograph: Andre Kosters/EPA“I was in the area and saw how desperate people are to save their houses,” he said. “I was also outside a hospital full of people who were injured after falling from the roofs. I asked some municipalities to distribute the manual together with the tarpaulins they were handing out to people, so that they could have some guidance and a greater awareness of the risks.”The civil protection agency has taken up the suggestion and has begun distributing the manual alongside tarpaulins.Storm-battered Portugal heads to polls as rivals unite to keep out far rightRead moreOne woman in the Coimbra region said she understood why people would risk their lives to try to protect their houses. The woman, who did not wish to be named, said she believed part of her late mother’s house would eventually collapse.“I try not to go inside because I can’t stop crying when I’m there,” she said. “I understand why people fell from their roofs. They’re desperate. If my legs allowed, I [would have] done so myself, out of my own desperation. But it’s very dangerous.”Portugal’s centre-right government, which is led by the prime minister, Luís Montenegro, has faced sustained criticism over its handling of the storms.“The resignation of the interior minister is proof the government has failed in its response to this emergency,” José Luís Carneiro, the general secretary of the opposition socialist party, told the press after Amaral stepped down.View image in fullscreenA road severely damaged by the extreme weather in Arruda dos Vinhos.Photograph: Antonio Pedro Santos/EPAThe far-right leader André Ventura, who finished second inlast weekend’s presidential election, accused Montenegro of an inability to deal with the crises that have buffeted Portugal over recent months.“The minister’s departure highlights the government’s inability to manage all the adversities the country has faced, from the fires to the recent storms,” he said.Neighbouring Spain is also suffering fromthe continuing extreme weather, propmting the state meteorological office to issue orange and red warnings for the north coast of the country and warn of waves up to nine metres (30 feet) tall.View image in fullscreenA huge wave hits the lighthouse of the town of Andratx, Majorca island, Balearic islands, eastern Spain.Photograph: Cati Cladera/EPAThirty-four people were taken to hospital in the northeastern region of Catalonia as high winds forced schools in some areas to close and led to the cancellation of dozens of flights.

Photograph: Alex SteinA pilot scheme in Brooklyn is giving businesses batteries to form an electricity storage network – part of a growing number of innovative DIY energy ideas around the worldByMaria Gallucci and Jeff St JohnThu 12 Feb 2026 09.19 ESTLast modified on Thu 12 Feb 2026 09.45 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleIn the back of Black Seed Bagels in northern Brooklyn is a giant catering kitchen filled with industrial-size containers of condiments and freezers full of dough. A tall, silver electric oven named the Baconator stands in a far corner, cooking thousands of pounds of meat every week to accompany Black Seed’s hand-rolled, wood-fired bagels. The Baconator is connected to a battery the size of a carry-on suitcase, which is plugged into the wall.While the morning rush is under way, the 2.8-kilowatt-hour battery can directly power the commercial oven to reduce the company’s reliance on the electric grid, Noah Bernamoff, Black Seed’s co-owner, explained recently at the company’s Bushwick shop. Two more batteries are paired with energy-intensive refrigerators in the front.Businesses like Black Seed often pay heftydemand chargeson their utility bills that reflect the maximum amount of power they use during a month – costs that can represent as much as half their total bill, on average. By shifting to battery power during key times, Black Seed aims to lower its peak grid needs and reduce monthly fees from the utility Con Edison in the process.View image in fullscreenNoah Bernamoff at Black Seed’s Bushwick shop, which serves as the company’s headquarters.Photograph: Maria Gallucci/Canary MediaBlack Seed is part of a battery pilot programme run byDavid Energy, a New York-based retail energy provider. The startup supplied the batteries for free last August and, using its software platform, controls exactly when the three appliances draw on backup power. Vivek Bhagwat, David Energy’s head of engineering, said he expected that tapping batteries for the refrigerators – which are always humming – would be especially helpful during the hottest months, when the shop’s air conditioners run around the clock.“We’re pretty optimistic about our ability to curtail energy in the summer, when it really matters most, through this machine,” he said, standing beside a doorless fridge holding water, juice and soda.For Black Seed, even modest benefits from batteries could make a difference if multiplied across the company’s 10 locations inNew YorkCity, Bernamoff said. By way of example, he noted that saving $80 at every shop every month could add up to almost $10,000 a year in avoided utility costs.“We’re in the game of nickels and dimes,” he said of the bagel business. ​“So we’re always happy to save the money.”View image in fullscreenA plug-in battery helps power a doorless fridge in Black Seed’s Bushwick shop.James McGinniss, David Energy’s CEO, thinks this ​“do-it-yourself battery” strategy has some serious potential to help small businesses combat rising electricity costs, both in New York and beyond. As well as in Black Seed’s Bushwick shop, his company has installed batteries at fast-food restaurants, a day spa and a dog grooming store, where the battery is cushioning the power draw of a fur-drying machine.As of mid-January, David Energy has signed deals with customers to put plug-in batteries in about 50 locations, adding up to more than 500kWh of energy storage capacity.The startup’s plug-in battery pilot is building on the growing interest in DIY energy technologies worldwide. McGinniss cited the example of balcony solar systems that can plug into standard household electrical outlets, which arebig in Germanybut aren’t yet allowed under most current electrical codes in the US – althoughstate lawmakers in New Yorkandelsewhere are pushing legislationto change that.Backup batteries, however, are ready for market. Portable batteries are increasingly affordable and popular options for households that are looking for backup power during blackouts but cannot, or don’t want to, install fossil fuel-burning generators.View image in fullscreenDavid Energy employees Arianna Gianakopoulos and Ted Moore deliver a battery to a Brooklyn customer in summer 2025.Photograph: David EnergyAs aretail energy provider, David Energy competes with large utilities and other energy retailers to provide customers with cheaper electricity plans. It does so primarily by buying electricity from wholesale markets and then reselling it to businesses and households. But the battery pilot is part of the company’s broader long-term goal to ​“run the grid 24/7 on clean energy,” McGinniss said.As solar and batteries have become ​“the cheapest electron we can create”, giving customers access to those technologies has become a business priority for David Energy as well – ​“because people like cheap energy,” he said.But how can a retail energy provider recoup the cost of supplying batteries to customers for free? McGinniss did not disclose the current financials for David Energy’s no-cost battery programme. But he did say the devices offered money-saving opportunities for customers and money-making ones for his business that could expand over time.For customers, the fundamental proposition is the opportunity to reduce a big, hard-to-manage portion of their monthly utility bills – the demand charges. Unlike the per-kWh ​“volumetric” charges that most households pay, these particular fees are assessed based on the maximum amount of power a business draws from the grid during any 15-minute period within a month. The structure is designed to incentivise customers to reduce peak electricity use, which drives much of the cost for utilities of building and maintaining grid infrastructure.For New York City businesses, these demand charges can add up to between 15% and 50% of a typical commercial customer’s monthly bill, McGinniss said. Using stored battery power for big appliances that tend to need a lot of energy during those times could significantly reduce those peaks, he said.The results can vary greatly from customer to customer, though McGinniss estimated that every kilowatt shaved from that peak could cut about $50 from a monthly bill. That’s a good way for David Energy to entice and retain customers, he said. But the startup can also use the same stored battery power to earn revenues for itself.One option is participating in so-calleddemand-response programmes, which pay customers to reduce power use during, for instance, hot summer evenings when demand for electricity is putting power plants and grid infrastructure under stress.Retail electricity providers such as David Energy can make (or lose) money depending on how cleverly they manage their ever-changing mix of purchases on wholesale energy markets against their commitments to provide their customers with retail power at competitive prices.View image in fullscreenOutside Black Seed’s shop in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighbourhood.Photograph: Stephanie Primavera/Canary MediaBernamoff at Black Seed Bagels said he was excited by the longer-term possibility of installing not only more plug-in batteries but also large-scale storage systems at its Bushwick location – particularly as city and state policymakers in New York push toelectrify buildings. Today, Black Seed primarily uses fossil gas appliances and heating systems in its stores. If the company is required to switch to electrified versions, adding batteries could help it manage its higher electricity bills and limit strain on the local grid, he said.“The industrial battery side of it all could be really interesting,” Bernamoff said, sitting at a cafe table beneath a poster advertising the store’s scallion-kimchi cream cheese. “To the extent that we’d be able to reduce peak power at the service level, instead of piece by piece, now we’re really talking. Because then every outlet, every lightbulb, is being better managed and reduced.”A version of this article wasoriginally publishedinCanary Mediaand has been republished in the Guardian as part of ourClimateDeskpartnership.Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesEnergy efficiencyEthical and green livingEnergyNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There may be some snow showers a little bit further south than that.“We’re not expecting any particularly impactful snow and the conditions will be quite brief before we get another system coming in from the Atlantic over the weekend, but for the next few days it will feel quite a bit different, as we’ve got colder air coming in.”BBC Scotland weather presenter Judith Ralston said: “With a change in weather type, we finally lose the stuck pattern of cloud, rain, and bitingly cold winds.“This finally breaks, allowing a northerly air mass to set in, bringing much drier, brighter conditions, sunshine on the way on Friday and Saturday and a few wintry showers on Friday.”Explore more on these topicsAberdeenScotlandUK weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Liberal and conservative factions are likely to campaign on the issue in elections later this year in the hope of breaking the deadlock in their favour.The General Synod debate on equal marriages – a timelineRead moreSynod members backed a proposal by bishops on Thursday to halt all work on a process known asLiving in Love and Faith(LLF) by 252 votes to 132, with 21 abstentions. The bishops’ motion acknowledged the “distress and pain many have suffered during the LLF process, especially LGBTQI+ people”.The decision means that three years of work on allowing clergy to conduct special services to bless same sex couples in a civil marriage will end. The prohibition on clergy being married in a civil ceremony to same sex partners will stay in place.Sarah Mullally, the archbishop of Canterbury, said that LLF had “left us wounded as individuals and a church” but that the bishops’ proposals were a “sensible way forward … that will take us to the next steps”.In a five-hour debate, many synod members spoke of their pain, anger and feelings of betrayal at the C of E’s failure to progress on the issues. Charlie Bączyk-Bell, a London priest who has campaigned for LGBTQ+ equality, said his heart was broken.Addressing bishops and fellow synod members, he said: “How dare you and how dare we come again to lament and recognise distress and pain while we continue to inflict it? … What kind of church is this? How has it come to this?”Claire Robson, a priest in Newcastle, said it was now unlikely she would be able to marry her same-sex partner because of her age. “The changes we long for will be too late for many of us,” she said.The cost of the LLF process had been £1.6m, she added, “but the cost to my life and ministry is incalculable … Hopes have been dashed and apologies rendered meaningless”.Proposing the motion, Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York, said: “This is not where I want us to be and not where we hoped we would be three years ago … I know that many of you are feeling angry and disappointed. There is a lot of pain and that pain cuts across so called ‘party lines’ or theological convictions held.”But, he added, “knowing how divided we are on these issues, we haven’t been able to find further ways forward that honour the consciences of those who, faithfully led by their conscientious reading of scripture and their understanding of tradition and of lived human experience, arrive at different conclusions”.The bishops and the synod were “more deeply divided than I think we knew – or admitted”, he said.A new working group on “relationships, sexuality and gender” will be set up for “continuing work”, under the wording of the motion. This, said Vicky Brett, a lay member of the synod who spoke in the debate, fitted the definition of insanity: “do the same thing over and over again expecting a different result”.The issue of sexuality and same-sex marriage has brought the Anglican church close to schism in recent years. After more than a decade of often rancorous debate, the synod finally concluded in early 2023 that it would not support weddings of same-sex couples in church, but would allow priests to bless gay couples within regular services.That decision prompted church leaders in some developing countries, including South Sudan, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to saythey no longer recognised Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, as the head of the global church.In July 2024, theC of E evangelical councilsaid it would start a parallel province because of the decision to allow gay marriages to be blessed. Such blessings were “contrary to the teaching of the Bible”, it said.Some clergy have defied the C of E hierarchy to offer stand-alone services of blessing to same-sex couples, seen by some as a de facto church wedding although without legal standing.Campaigners for equality have said there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that LGBTQ+ Christians are leaving the C of E, feeling they are unwelcome.Explore more on these topicsAnglicanismEqual marriageChristianityMarriageReligionLGBTQ+ rightsFamilynewsShareReuse this content"

The digital lives of our children are taking a greater and greater role and reading certainly is in decline.“I’m not saying no to screens altogether,” Dent said. “I think technology has a huge role to play in enhancing children’s vocabulary, if it’s used in the right way. But I think reading is really suffering.”Dent, who has two daughters (one, she said, more in thrall to screens than the other), said English-language speakers had always been afraid of new technology.“The Victorians were scared of the postcard because they thought it would hamper eloquence because people were going to have to cram sentences into a very small space. And the same happened with the telegram – there was great fear over that. And then we saw that magnified with the advent of the internet.“There are many ways in which the internet is actually helping. Rather than reducing language or English to some sort of bland monolith, it’s actually encouraged variety. But there is a sweet spot between over-immersion and just using it in ways that can be beneficial.”Dent, who co-presents Channel 4’sSecret Geniuswith Alan Carr, is fronting a new campaign – working with an unexpected partner, Soreen malt loaf – aimed at boosting children’s vocabulary at snack time.A limited edition of Soreen lunchbox loaves will include fun words such as kerfuffle and hullabaloo, with definition and origins, as a way of sparking children’s curiosity.“This is really close to my heart because I spend my life trying to encourage people, especially children, to enjoy the dictionary because I think it has more drama and magic and adventure than almost any other book I can imagine, and you will also find out the most wonderful stories,” Dent said.“I think we have lost a bit of that magic. Every age has thought that the golden age of language was in the past … and that somehow everything was perfect in the past. But I do think we are facing a huge challenge at the moment.“Obviously our children are learning from our habits and many of us get our work emails on our phone, so actually we are working on our phone, but what children are seeing is the constant absorption by something that’s not them.“We’ve all seen – and I think we’re all guilty of this – parents in cafes literally just looking at their phone while their children are just sitting looking as well. And that in some ways is a great sadness because conversation is everything.“For me the biggest worry is the widening gap between children who do read and who do have good vocabulary acquisition and those who don’t. It’s quite a well-known effect that children who read will then accelerate their vocabulary acquisition much more quickly and it’s at a much higher rate.”Is it a crisis? “When we use hyperbole for everything, it makes everything a crisis and it doesn’t particularly help,” Dent said. “But I think there is a huge concern around reading and vocabulary expansion.“I would just say that there are ways that we can address it. So it is not a foregone conclusion that this is going to continue exponentially and we are about to fall off a cliff. There are definitely things that can be done.“Dialogue or conversation integrated into daily life is really important, also word-based games. This is another way in which actually going online can help, because there are so many brilliant word games out there.”Dent also believes that learning a foreign language can play a critical role in developing a love and understanding of English. “If there’s one thing I could change, it would be to really promote the learning of foreign languages at school, because it’s just huge. It’s immeasurable the advantage it can give you.”Asked if it should be compulsory in schools, she said: “I would love it to be. It might seem like a chore, but I don’t think anyone ever regrets having learned a foreign language.”Explore more on these topicsChildrenLiteracyEarly years educationLanguagenewsShareReuse this content"

He also set up cameras to watch women changing or going to the toilet, and sexually assaulted a woman while she was asleep.Judge Dodd KC told Chan he had behaved in a “sexually deviant manner” in committing “utterly wicked, perverse and depraved” crimes against people whom he had owed trust – taking advantage of many of them as they slept to sexually abuse them.Referring to his victims, he told Chan many were too young to protect themselves. “They were defenceless.” He added: “There are so many of them: from the children involved to their parents; those who worked alongside you and those who were close to you.”Dodd gave the example of one child too young to write her own victim impact statement, but whose pain was clear in the statement made on her behalf. While many parents placed some blame on themselves for being unable to protect their children from Chan, he said they bore no responsibility. The responsibility was Chan’s alone.In comments read out by the prosecutor, the parents said the trauma was compounded by the knowledge Chan had recorded the abuse. “As parents, we live with constant fear about how it may affect our child as she grows,” they said. “Our child was harmed without the ability to protect herself. She was harmed at a time when she should have been safe.”Chan, from Finchley in north London, pleaded guilty to 56 charges. For a decade from 2007, he worked at a school where he upskirted pupils. He worked at a nursery for nearly seven more years, where he filmed himself abusing four children at a since-closed branch of Bright Horizons in West Hampstead, north-west London.At his sentencing at Wood Green crown court on Thursday, friends and relatives of those he abused told Chan he had profoundly broken their trust. One of the victims said the abuse to which Chan had subjected her had left her fearful she was being watched whenever she went to a bathroom.His crimes came to light when he showed a colleague two non-sexual videos of children in the nursery. The former colleague reported him to management, who spoke to police.Detectives initially arrested him on suspicion of child cruelty and seized dozens of electronic devices, for which he refused to give passwords. Once they were cracked, detectives found more than 1m images and videos of child abuse, and reviewed 300 hours of material – leading to his rearrest and the further, more serious charges.Officers have said more than 600 pupils passed through the school while Chan was working there and the nature of some of the photographs he took means they are unlikely ever to be able to specifically identify which of them he victimised.While police believe they have found all the devices containing evidence of the abuse of children, and that that offending can be isolated to his two places of work, they fear it could emerge he has abused more adult women in the wider world.In December, Chan pleaded guilty to 26 charges: five counts of sexual assault by penetration, four of sexual assault by touching, 11 of taking indecent images of children, and six of making indecent images of children. In January, he admitted 30 new charges: 12 counts of taking indecent photographs of children, six of outraging public decency, sexual assault on a female, and 11 counts of voyeurism.The judge sentenced him on five lead counts to 26 years; 18 of them to be served in prison, with a further eight years on extended licence. He told Chan he would become eligible for parole two-thirds of the way through the custodial portion of his sentence and, if released, would serve the remainder of that portion on licence; as well as the eight years of extended licence. He was given separate sentences on the other 51 charges to run concurrently.Bright Horizons faces legal action by a group of families who had children at the nursery. After the sentencing hearing, a lawyer for those families welcomed the sentence, but said the full scale of Chan’s offending remained unknown, and that “every child who suffered must see justice done”.Bright Horizons said: “This is a distressing time for families and all those impacted by Vincent Chan’s horrific crimes and our thoughts are first and foremost with them. Keeping children safe is our most important responsibility. Vincent Chan broke that trust.”An NSPCC helpline has been set up for anyone affected by Chan’s offending, on 0800 028 0828, which operates from 8am to 8pm Monday to Friday and 9am-6pm at weekends.In the UK, theNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

The richest man in the world posted about how the white race was under threat, made allusions to race science or promoted anti-immigrant conspiracy content on 26 out of 31 days in January, according to the Guardian’s analysis of his social media output. The posts, made on his platform X, reflect a renewed embrace of what extremism experts describe as white supremacist material.“Whites are a rapidly dying minority,” Musk said on 22 January, a short time before taking the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, while reposting an Irish anti-immigrant influencer’s video about demographic change.Musk’s posts included him repeatedly claiming white people face systemic discrimination, endorsing the conspiracy that there is an ongoing genocide against white people in countries around the world and promoting a claim that white people would be “slaughtered” by non-whites if they become a demographic minority.“If you stripped Elon Musk’s name off of these things and showed them to me, I would think that this was a white supremacist,” said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Extremism, who reviewed a selection of the posts.Epstein engineered intimate relationship for Tesla’s Kimbal Musk, emails showRead moreMusk has for years promoted anti-immigrant and far-right content in his posts, as well asendorsed rightwing activistsandpolitical partiesaround the globe. The Tesla CEO’s most recent output displays a more consistent and explicit engagement with white supremacist content and nativist activists than in the past, however, lending them the imprimatur of the world’s richest person and spreading their ideas to his audience of over 200 million followers. Beirich said he appeared “deep into the world of white nationalism”.“The White ‘liberal’ standard for behavior is extremely strict, but is only applied to Whites,” Musk said on 26 January, commenting on a post that claimed there was discrimination against white conservatives.Musk’s posts repeatedly echoed prominent white supremacist narratives and ideologies, said William Braniff, the former director of the Department of Homeland Security’s office for prevention of terrorism and extremism. Several of Musk’s posts included what Braniff described as “textbook examples” of white supremacist conspiracy theories such as “the great replacement” – a belief that liberal elites or Jewish people are conspiring to use immigration to replace white populations.The danger of Musk’s obsession lies in mainstreaming ideas that are deeply tied to violence and discrimination, according to Braniff, who is now executive director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (Peril) at American University. “The great replacement has been an especially important mobilizing narrative for highly lethal white supremacist attacks in the United States and elsewhere,” he said.Musk has repeatedly denied he is racist or antisemitic, stated that he condemns terrorism and said he does not advocate for violence. He asserted in a 2024 interview with Don Lemon that he does not subscribe to “great replacement theory”. He also told Joe Rogan in March last year that he is not a Nazi, weeks after facing condemnations from Jewish groups and the chairman of the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Israel over his speech to Germany’s far-right AfD party in whichhe told Germansto move beyond their “past guilt”.Musk offers a platform for the far-rightAlthough Musk wrote a number of posts on race and immigration himself last month, much of his output involved reposting far-right activist accounts or replying to them with brief endorsements such as a bullseye emoji, implying agreement. On 10 January, Musk replied “yes” in reply to a post from a white nationalist account that claimed “race communism that destroyed Rhodesia and South Africa are the same things they are bringing to America and the rest of the Occident to turn us into the Global Favela”. The author of the post previously published a blog titled How To Build An American Orania – a reference to theprivately owned, whites-only townof Orania in South Africa.Similar interactions took place throughout the month. After a far-right influencer posted “they just want to eradicate White people it’s that simple” in reference to the New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s inauguration speech, Musk replied on 7 January “some people really do”. On 9 January, he wrote “true” in a quote-tweet of a post that claimed white people would be “slaughtered” as a minority and that “White solidarity is the only way to survive”. On 16 January, Musk reposted a rightwing influencer’s post claiming “white genocide is the official Democrat party platform”. The same day, he promoted another rightwing influencer’s anti-diversity post that used an AI-generated image of tattooed black women on Yale’s rowing team.While some of the accounts Musk interacted with are fringe social media influencers, several others are prominent far-right activists whose extremist views have been well-documented. On 17 January, Musk reposted a screed against “ethno-cultural upheaval” in Europe from Martin Sellner, far-right Austrian activist, who is the founder of the ethno-nationalist Identitarian Movement. Musk, whoreinstated Sellner’s banned X account in 2024, replied to the anti-immigration post that “this is simply a statement of fact”.“Martin Sellner is probably the most significant global white supremacist right now,” Beirich said. “He’s the one who pushed the great replacement, and has now pushed the idea of remigration – ethnically cleansing western countries of non-whites.”Sellner gavea presentation in 2024 at an event in Germanyon the logistics of carrying out mass deportations that was attended by neo-Nazis and other extremists. The event sparked immense backlash andprotests against the far-rightacross the northern European nation. Lawmakers attempted to ban him from the country. The Austrian activist alsoreceived a €1,500 donation from and communicated with white supremacist Brenton Tarrant, who would later go on to commit a terrorist attack in 2019 that killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.Sellner rejected being described as a white supremacist and said he respects “the dignity of all others” in a statement to the Guardian, while taking credit for politically mainstreaming the concepts of the great replacement and remigration. “Now, from Trump to Musk, everyone is talking about replacement migration, the ethnic vote and remigration,” Sellner said. He additionally claimed that the Potsdam event was “misrepresented” by media and that he rejected any form of terrorism. Sellner described his interactions with Tarrant, which includedoffering to get a drinkwith Tarrantif he ever visited Austria, as limited to standard thank-you emails to a donor.Extremism experts said the ideas Musk has publicized are deeply tied to some of the most notorious, violent extremist attacks of the past decade, including the 2018 antisemitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and the 2022 racist mass killing of 10 people at a Buffalo supermarket. The shooter in Buffaloleft a 180-page manifestofilled with mentions of white supremacist replacement theory.Musk’s posts also reflect an increasing embrace of white supremacist figures and talking points among prominent Republicans and government agencies in the past year. Some of that shift has played out on X, where Musk reinstated a number of formerly banned accounts such as prominent antisemite Nick Fuentes. Federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security have meanwhileposted contentthat aligns with white supremacist propaganda. Earlier this month, Donald Trump also drew widespread backlashafter posting a racist videoto his Truth Social platform that depicted Barack and Michelle Obama as apes.Musk has repeatedly mocked those who have criticized his comments as far-right or racist, framing his views as common sense or simply reiterating facts and statistics. His rhetoric reflects a widespread tactic among people on the far-right, experts say, when extremists attempt to defend their worldview of an in-group of white people against everyone else.“That reductionist worldview breaks down when people in your in-group say you’re full of it, that what you’re saying is wrong,” Braniff said. “So now the main requirement is to attack the dissenting in-group, to delegitimize them as race traitors and as woke.”As February began, Musk was still posting about race and immigration on a consistent basis. He replied to an anti-immigrant activist this week who claimed that Ireland’s civilization would end “because Irish men are afraid of being called racist and upsetting people from the 3rd world”.“Such men are pathetic traitors,” Musk responded.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskRaceXnewsShareReuse this content"

He said the BBC was more needed than ever as media groups around the world cut back their coverage.However, he said it now had to be “quite aggressive” in reshaping its public service broadcasting, and that it was “a tough environment for households”. Savings are expected to amount to between £400m and £600m.Leigh Tavaziva, the BBC’s chief operating officer, told staff that the number of people paying the licence fee was declining faster than the corporation had forecast. The BBC’s last annual report showed300,000 more householdshad stopped paying the fee.The Guardian broke the news of a majorBBC cuts programme last year. All departments will have to find savings, while sources said outsourcing of some functions could also be involved.A BBC spokesperson said: “Over the last three years we have delivered more than a half a billion pounds’ worth of savings, much of which we’ve been able to reinvest into our output across the BBC. In a rapidly changing media market, we continue to face substantial financial pressures. As a result we expect to make further savings over the next three years of around 10% of our costs.“This is about the BBC becoming more productive and prioritising our offer to audiences to ensure we’re providing the best value for money, both now and in the future.”Philippa Childs, the head of the Bectu union, which represents people in the creative industries, said: “Additional cuts of this scale will inevitably damage its ability to perform its vital national function. BBC staff will be deeply worried by this news, and Bectu will be engaging urgently with the BBC to understand the implications.”It came as it emerged that a hearing of Donald Trump’smultibillion dollar lawsuitagainst the BBC over the editing of one of his speeches had been set for a year’s time. In a blow to the corporation, a Florida judge has rejected the BBC’s attempt to put off disclosing internal documents relating to the episode of Panorama that contained the spliced version of Trump’s 2021 address.Trump made the speech in Washington before supporters stormed the US Capitol. The BBC has apologised for cutting together two parts of the speech without making the edit clear to viewers, but it denies it defamed the president.BBC lawyers in the US had argued that the process of disclosing documents relating to the legal action should wait until the judge decided whether the court even had any jurisdiction to rule in the case.

Ofcom is to report on the “media public interest considerations”. They have been given until the middle of June to report back, ending any hopes of a speedy deal.In January, officials said Nandy had concerns that the Mail’s stable of publications meant it already had “a substantial share” of the UK newspaper market. It also owns the i paper, Metro and the New Scientist magazine.The official said the deal would give DMGT control of 46.68% of “the right-leaning national daily print newspaper market”. Officials also said that while the Daily Mail and the Telegraph had “overlapping” editorial positions, they targeted “different audiences within the right-leaning spectrum”.After that letter, DMGT told Nandy the media landscape had changed drastically in recent years with the arrival of digital platforms and outlets, meaning the traditional print newspaper market could no longer be seen in isolation.It also questioned the value of labelling media titles as “rightwing”, given the vagueness of the term.In a letter to DMGT yesterday, a government official said print editions remained a “flagship product for many news organisations”. They said Nandy continued to have concerns about a “reduction in plurality of views and plurality of persons with control”.The £500m price tag of the deal has been widely regarded as expensive, though sources said Rothermere had raised the cash.A spokesperson for DMGT said: “The news media industry is changing rapidly, and publishers must compete with an array of online sources. Against this backdrop, trusted news organisations will play an ever more critical role, and that requires publishers with the resources and experience to compete.“We remain committed to investing in the Telegraph and its journalists, preserving its distinctive editorial voice and team, and accelerating its global expansion, with a focus on the US.“We look forward to working constructively with regulators and the government to secure a timely completion of the transaction, which will provide stability and certainty to the Telegraph after a protracted period of uncertainty.”The reviews mean the Telegraph titles will continue to be in purgatory over their ownership. The titles wereput up for sale in 2023after the Barclay brothers lost control of them.A sale was initially agreed to an Abu Dhabi-backed consortium, RedBird IMI, but this was blocked by the previous Conservative government over concerns about foreign state ownership.A deal was then agreed with the US firm RedBird Capital, with Abu Dhabi allowed to take a minor stake after the Labour government tweaked the law. However, that fell through after delays and an internal rebellion.A deal was then struck with DMGT in November.Explore more on these topicsNewspapersNational newspapersNewspapers & magazinesTelegraph Media GroupLisa NandyDaily MailDaily Mail & General TrustnewsShareReuse this content"

This was less than a 0.2% rise that economists had been expecting.The economy grew by 1.3% in 2025, an improvement on growth of 1.1% in 2024, although worse than official forecasts of 1.5%. The ONS said the economy also expanded by 0.1% on a monthly basis in December, slowing from 0.2% in November – a figure that wasrevised down from 0.3%.The downbeat data came asRachel Reevesprepares to use a major speech in the coming weeks to insist she will stick to her growth plan, reviving the term “securonomics” to describe the approach.After a deliberately low-key House of Commons statement to mark the spring forecast on 3 March, the chancellor plans to deliver a public lecture, reiterating her strategy and setting out priorities for 2026.Treasury sources said these will include the opportunities the government sees in AI – with an aide calling her an “optimist” about the technology – and hopes for closer EU ties.It follows the revelation that health secretary Wes Streeting told then US ambassador Peter Mandelson that Labour had “no growth strategy at all”.The rise came despite there being no growth at all in the dominant services sector, which makes up about 80% of the economy. The small boost was instead driven by the production sector, up by 1.2%, while the construction industry shrank 2.1%, its worst performance in four years, the ONS said.Bar graph showing GDP per quarter since start of 2024Liz McKeown, the director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: “The economy continued to grow slowly in the last three months of the year, with the growth rate unchanged from the previous quarter.“The often-dominant services sector showed no growth, with the main driver instead coming from manufacturing. Construction, meanwhile, registered its worst performance in more than four years.”Business investment fell by 2.7% in the final quarter, while consumer spending grew by a sluggish 0.2%.The figures back up earlier consumer and business surveys that suggested economic activity had slowed in the run-up to the late November budget, as households held off spending and companies delayed investment decisions amid speculation that the chancellor would implement significant tax rises.“The big picture is that private sector activity still appears to be extremely subdued,” said Ruth Gregory, the deputy chief UK economist at CapitalEconomics.The UK economy fared relatively well in the first half of 2025, with growth of 0.7% in the first quarter and 0.3% in the second quarter.However, economic output was then hit by thecyber-attack on Britain’s biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, which depressed vehicle production and led to the minimal growth in the third quarter. Speculation around the autumn budget appears to have further hindered growth in the final three months.“These figures confirm that the UK economy ended 2025 with a whimper,” said Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. “Businesses had a particularly bleak quarter as the dark cloud of uncertainty caused by the budget and higher costs severely curtailed trade and investment plans.”However, more recent surveys for January have suggested that business and consumer sentiment picked up in the new year, with economists expecting growth of 0.4% in the first quarter of 2026.Fergus Jimenez-England, an associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said the government must avoid spooking businesses any further.“With the spring statement upcoming in March, the chancellor should look to support this change in sentiment by avoiding a repeat of last year and refrain from further policy changes,” he said.The Office for Budget Responsibility hadforecast GDP growthto be 1.5% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. The government’s official forecaster expects the economy to grow at annual pace of 1.5% up to 2030, partly because of low productivity growth.Bank of England policymakersleft interest rates unchanged at 3.75% last weekbut indicated that lower inflation as a result of cost of living measures in Reeves’s budget should pave the way for cuts in the months ahead.Reeves, who on Wednesday insisted Labour could win the political argument for acloser relationship with the EU, said: “The government has the right economic plan to build a stronger and more secure economy, cutting the cost of living, cutting the national debt and creating the conditions for growth and investment in every part of the country.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsRachel ReevesOffice for National StatisticsServices sectornewsShareReuse this content"

That was a modest improvement on the 1.1% recorded in 2024 – while GDP per head, the measure that matters more for living standards – was up 1%, after flatlining in the previous year.That was certainly not a performance in line with Labour’s pre-election promise to secure “the highest sustained growth in the G7”.As the ONS points out, Canada, under its prime minister, Mark Carney, had faster growth of 1.6% in 2025, and while fourth quarter data for the US has not yet been published, it is clear that it is likely to have outpaced the UK.The Treasury would highlight external factors, including the instability created by Donald Trump’son-off tariff policies, which caused chaos in financial markets and forced US-facing businesses to rethink supply chains.But economists also point to the imposition of Reeves’s £25bn employer national insurance rise last April, and thechaotic run-upto her second tax-raising budget in late November.However, there are some reasons to be more optimistic for 2026. Policymakers at the Bank of England’s rate-setting meeting last week pointed the way to a seventh interest rate cut, perhaps as soon as next month, despiteleaving rates unchanged at 3.75%.That was largely because, alongside post-dated tax rises, Reeves’s budget included a slate of price-cutting measures, including a reduction in energy bills, which will help inflation to move back down to target.The Treasury will be hoping that another rate cut, alongside its anti-inflation measures, will cheer up wary consumers and reassure businesses. Forward-lookingsurveys have pointed to an upturnof late, though there is continued anxiety about job cuts.Reeves will have been encouraged by news that business investment, which Labour sees as crucial to improving the UK’s flailing productivity, was up 3.5% in 2025 (though it fell in the fourth quarter).And she intends to make next month’s spring forecast from the Office of Budget Responsibility as much of a non-event as possible, avoiding the turmoil that surrounded last year’s botched statement, when she made welfare cuts that then had to be reversed.Economists now expect growth to pick up in the coming months – unless Reeves’s colleagues choose this moment for a potentially destabilising tilt at Starmer. As Thomas Pugh, of consultancy RSM, put it, “the biggest risk now is a protracted and noisy leadership contest that could reopen Pandora’s box of tax increases and inject a renewed bout of uncertainty”.Explore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)Rachel ReevesEconomicsLabourOffice for National StatisticsanalysisShareReuse this content"

But it’s also worth noting its positive effects: how TikTok users can make improbable tracks from pop history go viral; how social media can transform the fortunes of an artist who probably wouldn’t have got past a record company’s reception in our current, risk-averse era.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for The Apple Tree Under the Sea.Which brings us to North Carolina’s Isimeme Udu, better known as Hemlocke Springs, who rose to fame posting homemade videos of her songs on TikTok. There’s always a chance that a label might have gone all in on a bespectacled 27-year-old former librarian fond of neon-coloured wigs, purveying “awkward Black girl anthems” via a lo-fi take on 80s-influenced synth pop, but you wouldn’t bet on it. Self-released, her tracks have racked up millions of streams and attracted the attention ofDoja CatandChappell Roan, both of whom took her on tour: cue a video of Springs supporting Roanat New York’s Forest Hills stadium last autumn, performingGirlfriendwhile most of the 13,000-capacity audience sings along.It’s a heartwarming success story – a DIY artist succeeding thanks to geeky, home-brewed originality and the maddening catchiness of her melodies – or at least it is up to a point. Online virality tends to be predicated on novelty, and it’s in the nature of novelty to wear off. The obvious question that hangs over Springs’ debut album is whether it can translate one form of success into another, more familiar and lasting. But The Apple Tree Under the Sea suggests that straightforward mainstream success isn’t what Hemlocke Springs wants.Like her previous singles, the album is self-released (via label services company Awal). You can tell. Were a major label involved, one suspects they might have steered her towards something less idiosyncratic. Something closer in tone, perhaps, to the tracks that got her noticed, than this concept album about her upbringing as the child of devoutly Christian Nigerian parents, replete with songs decrying their homeland’s deeply rooted cultural practice of arranged marriage (“I would rather kill myself than look him in the eyes and say I want your love,” she sings onw-w-w-w-w), or which invoke God using the ancient Hebrew name El Shaddai. They would probably have ensured more familiar names appeared in the songwriting credits – the album is a collaboration between Springs and Burns, an English EDM producer best known for cowriting a handful of tracks on Lady Gaga’sChromatica– and might well have done their best to smooth out the album’s sound into something more homogenous.As it is, you lurch from brash electronics to pop-dance to 80s metal guitars to music that, with its massed staccato vocals, has something of the show tune about it; from a piano ballad and pizzicato strings to music that variously recalls Prince, Stevie Nicks and Britney Spears. All these variations take place in the space of three songs.Hemlocke Springs: Sever the Blight – video.There are points where this fidgety, swipe-right eclecticism can get a bit exhausting, compounded by the apparently infinite malleability of Springs’ voice, which can go from raw and apparently untutored to mannered and carefully enunciated in the blink of an eye. But equally, there are points where it works to head-spinning effect, as onSever the Blight– where a Kate Bush-evoking intro gives way to a burst of dramatic film-soundtrack synths, which are replaced by crisp electronic pop – or Moses, which shifts from a gospel-ish choir to an ominous bass tone to a fantastic pop chorus. The latter feels key: even at its most scattered, the music here is invariably tethered to precisely the kind of well-crafted earworms that marked out Springs’ online breakthrough. Meanwhile, the lyrics are never less than intriguing. “I wonder who’s walking around with fertiliser and amplifying all the tension in her head,” she sings onHead, Shoulders, Knees and Ankles, a line that she rhymes with “the tenebrous festered corners of your bed”.‘Fame is like going through puberty’: Chappell Roan on sexuality, superstardom and the joy of dragRead moreThe stuff that most resembles her breakthrough hits – such as a wonky take on something you could imagine the characters in Stranger Things jamming out to in their downtime – is all sequestered at the album’s end: in fairness, the whole thing is over in barely 30 minutes, but you still feel like you’ve travelled quite a long distance to get there. Again, a major label might have had something to say about structuring an album like that, and more fool them. Springs’ approach is appealingly assured: this is what I want to do, this is who I am, take it or leave it. It’s an approach that sometimes produces mainstream fame – you can see a similar intractability in Chappell Roan – but is more likely to result in cult success. And that, one suspects, is exactly the aim here, in which case: job done.This week Alexis listened toSofia Kourtesis - Los Poemas No Siempre RimanA perfect counterpart to the relentless grey misery of February: a house collaboration with Afro-Peruvian band Novalima that exudes warmth and joy without slipping into cliche.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Chalamet added: “I did another take, and then the guy said, ‘I was just in jail for 30 years. You really don’t want to fuck with me. You don’t want to see me angry.’ I said to Josh, ‘Holy shit, who do you have me opposite, man?’”The answer was that Safdie had casta non-actor– one of many who have roles inMarty Supreme, a fictionalised homage to the mid-20th century table tennis player Marty Reisman. Similarly, Paul Thomas Anderson used people with no prior acting experience for his comedy action thrillerOne Battle After Another.Safdie and Anderson are following in a long tradition of directors using non-professionals to achieve a level of authenticity based on lived experience and physical presence rather than theatrical technique. It has run the gamut from early Soviet cinema and Italian neorealism to a fleeting appearance byDonald Trump in Home Alone 2.One Battle After Another has marquee names aplenty – Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro, Teyana Taylor – but also a striking cameo by James Raterman, a retired Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security Investigations special agent. Raterman was spotted by Anderson after taking part inThe Trade, a documentary series about the opioid crisis and human trafficking.Despite his lack of acting experience, he threw himself wholly into the role of Colonel Danvers. “It’s a job and you have to work at it,” Raterman says by phone from Columbus, Ohio. “The good thing with myself and Paul is he’s so collaborative. He allowed me with the other actors to pull it off the cuff.“This is one of the best pieces of acting advice that I’ve received and I received it from Mr Anderson. He said, Jim, when you read the script, don’t pay attention to the words on the page; pay attention to what is it that I need you to do at that particular time. Honestly, I could have probably gone to film school and studied for years and years and maybe got that same piece of advice but, coming from somebody like Paul Thomas Anderson, it put you in a different frame of mind.”Raterman has nothing but praise for how the professional actors onOne Battle After Anotherwelcomed him into the fold. “These are amazing A-list actors that have no problem whatsoever taking you under their wing and treating you like a family member and wanting you to elevate in such a way that the whole project gets elevated.View image in fullscreenPaul Grimstad in One Battle After Another.Photograph: Public domain“You never felt like a stranger, you never feel like an outsider and that started at the top. It started with Paul Thomas Anderson and that’s the way he is so everybody takes his lead. I don’t know if everybody has the same experience but they treated me like a family member from day one until even today. It was an incredible, fun, enjoyable experience. We laughed, we bonded, made some incredible friendships.”One Battle After Another also featuresPaul Grimstad, a musician, writer and professor of humanities at Yale University. For years he avoided on-camera work following an early part in his roommate Ronald Bronstein’s indie film Frownland. But then Bronstein passed Grimstad’s name to casting director Cassandra Kulukundis, who immediately saw a natural fit with the character Howard Sommerville.Grimstad, 52,told the New York Times newspaperthat “acting was incredibly fun” and said his years as a university lecturer were ideal preparation. “There is an element of verbal performance in teaching. I’m not talking about over-the-top showmanship, but a certain way of animating a book.”Grimstad also appears in Marty Supreme, primarily set in New York during the early 1950s,along with non-actorsincluding the supermarket magnate John Catsimatidis, former basketball players George Gervin and Tracy McGrady, essayist and novelistPico Iyer, playwright David Mamet, fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, Shark Tank regular Kevin O’Leary and French high wire artist Philippe Petit.Catsimatidis, 77, says: “Josh Safdie says he met me or saw me when I was running for mayor in 2013 and I was what you call a New York character and he was looking for characters. Being a New York character, I guess I qualify. The lines that I used are things that I do in real life, so I wasn’t acting: that was me.”He reflects: “I enjoyed it. They worked me to midnight. They did one scene 20 times over. Josh Safdie was a great director. He’s a perfectionist and I appreciate somebody that wants perfection.”Petit, who in 1974 walkedbetween the twin towersof the World Trade Center in New York on a tightrope, says: “Many directors are interested in what I would call the freshness of the non-actors. Very often when you take a non-actor instead of a movie star for a movie, that non-actor doesn’t have the training and some of it could be negative but I also very much like to have a complete newcomer to do something important. It’s sometimes a revelation.”McGrady, 46, who played for teams including the Orlando Magic and Houston Rockets, adds via email: “I think we bring something real. There’s an authenticity that comes from people who’ve lived a different life and bring that energy naturally. For me, I’m just being myself and bringing my own experience to the role. Sometimes that rawness adds something special (hopefully).”Gervin, 73,a former San Antonio Spurs player dubbed the “Iceman”, says: “I met Josh, the director, a few years ago at a card show, and we shook hands and spoke and the next thing I know, I’m getting a call from the studio that Josh would like me to play a role in the movie.”View image in fullscreenJohn Catsimatidis in Marty Supreme.Photograph: Public domainGervin plays Lawrence, the owner of a table tennis parlour in midtown Manhattan. He says of Safdie: “He’s very careful in who he picks. He said, when I met George Gervin, George was so warm that he made me feel that he can run an orphanage. He knows that I have two charter schools so I’m around kids all the time and educate them. Did he take a chance? Probably so but he was in control of what goes in and what goes out and I’m glad he had that kind of confidence in me.”Gervin found that film-making involves long hours. “I went on set at three in the afternoon and didn’t finish till about four in the morning. I wasn’t used to that kind of endurance but it only took me a day to do the little part that I had in the movie. You have a different respect for someone like Timothée, who’s the main character and he was up 12 hours with me. You have to be mentally and physically strong to accomplish what he did. I am truly impressed with what goes into making movies.”Safdie envisioned Lawrence’s club as a safe place for misfits, which was a gift for casting directorJennifer Vendittito study 1950s photographs and tell its story through faces. Her work on Marty Supreme has made the shortlist for the new Oscar category ofbest casting.Venditti, who started street casting 25 years ago when she was in the fashion industry, is a longtime collaborator with both Josh Safdie and his film-maker brother, Benny. She cast the ex-basketball playerKevin Garnettas himself in the Safdies’ 2019 crime thrillerUncut Gems.She says by phone: “One of our signature things is this idea that we are looking to recreate the cinema of life. Sometimes we love actors and characters but sometimes in the pool of actors we can’t find the texture that’s needed to build the authenticity of the world that we’re exploring.”Venditti adds: “We’re always trying to create this alchemy of these incredible actors who know where scenes are going and then these wild people who can add the texture and mystery of they don’t know where the scene’s going and it’s the tension between those two things that creates the excitement in Josh’s films. It’s how we see the world and how we want to see it on screen.”How do established actors generally respond?“At first, if you’re like a very trained actor, it can be alarming in a sense of like, wait, this person’s not following the rules or talking over me. But Josh is such an amazing director that creates such a safe environment, they trust him and they then realise that kind of wildness is lending to their performance.”The process works both ways, Venditti notes. “The scene partner makes these real people good. Timothée is in every scene showing up with his dedication and his focus and his level of mastery. They are so good because they’re in a scene with someone that’s demanding that of them then they rise to meet each other.”The use of non-actors dates back to early Soviet movies such as Sergei Eisenstein’sBattleship Potemkinand October in the 1920s. Italian neorealist films such as Vittorio De Sica’s Bicycle Thieves frequently used non-actors to represent the working class and used post-production dubbing by professional voice actors to ensure clear dialogue and emotional control.Notable US and UK examples include The Best Years of Our Lives, featuring Harold Russell, a second world war veteran who lost both hands;The Killing Fieldswith Haing S Ngor, a Cambodian doctor and genocide survivor with no acting experience; and United 93, in which real flight crew, air traffic controllers and military personnel played themselves.Catherine O’Rawe, author of The Non-Professional Actor: Italian Neorealist Cinema and Beyond and a professor of Italian film and culture at the University of Bristol in Britain, says: “The non-professional is such an interesting figure. It forces us to look at the question of what is acting, what is performance? Is it just standing up and saying a line? What is it that good acting brings? Some of the non-actors, for example, in the films of postwar Italy were not necessarily what we would think of as brilliant actors but had an amazing face that the director loved.”View image in fullscreenYalitza Aparicio in Roma.Photograph: Alfonso Cuarón/APBut the practice has also been controversial. Four-year-oldVictoire Thivisolwon the best actress award at the 1996 Venice Film Festival for her role in Ponette, about a child who has lost her mother. O’Rawe says: “The performance was so affecting that she won this award and the director collected it on her behalf and got booed by the critics and audience because it’s seen as an affront to profession: if a four-year-old can do this then what is the craft of acting worth?”In 2018Yalitza Apariciomade her acting debut in Alfonso Cuarón’s drama Roma, earning a nomination for the Oscar for best actress. O’Rawe comments: “She was a total non-actor and that was a source of great fascination among the press but sometimes people are a bit uncomfortable that someone with no training can actually be nominated for awards because then for professional actors it can mean, well, why have we spent our lives training and doing all this performance study if somebody can just walk off the streets and win an Oscar?”But these accidental stars often find it impossible to build a lasting career. They can be propelled into the spotlight at theOscarsonly to be left without a safety net once the production cycle ends. The industry may fall in love with an “unspoiled” face for a single project, but it rarely offers the infrastructure needed to turn a singular moment of authenticity into a profession.O’Rawe reflects: “These debates have gone on and they come back at different times but there is always this undercurrent of both the resentment and also that the industry might love these people once but they’re not going to support them.“There are so many cases of these actors who after one big moment, sometimes even winning an award, will find that they can’t get jobs because they’re not trained, don’t have any contacts in the film industry or don’t have any agents or managers or people looking after them. It can be very difficult to build or sustain a career.”Explore more on these topicsOscars 2026OscarsOne Battle After AnotherAwards and prizesMarty SupremefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cue this frenetic, witty caper from Derry Girls’ Lisa McGee – complete with a sensational performance from Saoirse-Monica JacksonLucy ManganThu 12 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleThree middle-aged women may be all you need for anything. To run a business, raise a village, end a war, retool a civilisation, empty the loft. Even more usefully, you can make a great murder-mystery caper with them, as Lisa McGee (a fourth woman! If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it) has done with her new series How to Get to Heaven from Belfast.McGee made her name, of course, with Derry Girls – a nigh-on perfect sitcom that followed the trials and tribulations of a group of Northern Irish Catholic schoolgirls (and a beleaguered English cousin) as they went about the chaotic business of growing up in the mid-90s at the tail end of the Troubles. The main characters of the new offering don’t map precisely on to the previous one but the DNA of Derry Girls as an entity remains gloriously alive (is DNA alive? I feel a curious urge to consult Sister Michael). How to Get to Heaven has all of the verve, acuity and havoc dancing on top of the immaculate plotting that you find in McGee’s masterwork. The only difference is that one of the schoolgirls is dead. Probably. Maybe. Perhaps not.To explain: Dara (Caoilfhionn Dunne), Saoirse (Roisin Gallagher) and Robyn (Sinéad Keenan) are old schoolfriends who reunite to attend the funeral of Greta (Natasha O’Keeffe) – “We’re dying now, is it?” says Robyn, rightly enraged by the relentless march of time – who completed their teenage gang of four. That was, until something went wrong for Greta one night 20 years ago and the three others came to her aid. We get a flashback to a forest shack on fire, a menacing-looking man and satanic-looking symbols on the wall …. The three stayed in touch, bound by friendship and a secret, but lost touch with Greta.According to the local grapevine, Greta was killed by a fall down the stairs. Saoirse, a TV crime writer by trade (she wanted to write plays but her ambition was stymied by the need to buy stuff), immediately suspects foul play and then foul play of a different order when she notices at the wake that the body in the coffin lacks the occult tattoo (yes, matching the one on the flashback wall) that the four friends have. We all suspect the foulest play when we see that Greta’s husband, Owen, the local police chief, is played by Emmett J Scanlan, the most actually frightening actor in history, who makes me wish to hide behind the sofa as if I were again a child convulsing in terror at Doctor Who. Her mother, Margo (Michelle Fairley), is an almost equally unholy presence.Something is up all right. Robyn, a deeply stressed wife and mother of four, thinks she might have an insight because things have recently taken a turn for the worse with her Patrick, who has become “very controlling … gaslighting, all that kind of thing”. “He’s only one,” says Dara, sceptically. “He’s one and a half,” says Robyn through gritted teeth, of her toddler. “And he knows what he’s doing.”She and Dara are reluctant to get involved, but teenage loyalty – and the fear that Greta’s death/disappearance might be connected to the secret in the woods – runs deep. Soon Saoirse has them on side and investigating, and the caper proper begins. It takes in much, at a frenetic pace, and the energy never flags. So much so that you might just occasionally wish it would pause for a moment to allow everyone to catch their breath and give moments time to land. But overall the experience is a switchbacking rush of joy and you would have to be a very cankered soul and/or professional critic to even mention it as a flaw in the midst of so much fun.View image in fullscreenDarragh Hand as Liam.Photograph: NetflixThere is ill-advised drinking, enigmatic hand-delivered letters, and a young attractive guard called Liam (Darragh Hand) who is willing to brave investigating his boss. There is a car crash, clues gleaned from teenage diaries and buried memories, a trip to Portugal, a possible assassin (Bronagh Gallagher), twist, turns, complications, revelations and much else – including Ardal O’Hanlon as an eccentric hotel owner and Saoirse-Monica Jackson in an absolutely wild, perfect performance a few episodes in. The latter of which is both impossible to describe and would give too much away if I did, but you must see it if you see nothing else this year.And it’s all written with McGee’s customary wit, brutality and sensitivity. The actors (including the young ones who portray the teenage versions of the adult protagonists) keep the whole thing together and emotionally credible, though the preposterousness of the plot increases at a roughly geometric rate – as questions of conscience (“She’s having an attack of the Catholics”), loyalty and what is owed to whom begin to show through the chaos and the laughs. Buckle up, and enjoy.How to Get to Heaven from Belfast is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

A role model to all of a certain age, Dawson Leery taught us how to break and enter, how to be a bad friend and, most importantly, how to yearn. His years-long pursuit of the girl next door is still, for some of us, the reason we keep sending late-night texts to people who absolutely do not want to hear from us.So, as we grieve the floppy-haired man who became the less-hot lead as the series went on, let’s look back at some of the most iconic moments spent in Capeside.10. Every time the theme song playedFrom its rousing piano intro to its stirring snare drum climax, Paula Cole’s I Don’t Want to Wait became the anthem of 90s romantics everywhere. We felt those lyrics deep in our teenaged hearts – we’re 15, we’ll be dead before we know it, there’s no time to waste. I thought about walking down the aisle to this song, but my literal wedding somehow didn’t seem romantic enough to justify it.9. Jen’s arrivalIn my memory, Jen Lindley’s taxi pulled up much later in the show’s run, but she actually arrives in the pilot episode. NYC transplant and love interest Jen is everything Dawson’s childhood pal and longstanding flame Joey isn’t: blonde, cosmopolitan, and blonde. Sent to live with her Grams after a life of sex and drugs (rarely mentioned), Jen throws back her shiny hair, swishes her summer dress, and drives an immediate wedge between Joey, Dawson and his best friend Pacey, setting the next six seasons in motion.8. Jack coming out through a poemThe 90s was a peak time for poems as plot devices (“I don’t hate you, not even a little bit, not even at all”) but the outing of shy Capeside high schooler Jack by his English teacher was one of the more memorable. Having found the words to begin to express his sexuality, Jack finds himself forced to read his feelings aloud in front of his whole class. Weeping through his (beautiful) verse, Jack finally flees the classroom. Pacey’s fiery and heroic defence of his friend was unusual for the 90s, when other shows were still using queerness as a punchline.7. Mitch’s deathWe can surely all agree that in early seasons, Dawson was a garbage human with a habit of being absolutely disgraceful to the people who loved him – especially his hot dad. In season five, after a heated argument about Dawson dropping out of film school, Mitch Leery just wants an icecream. Unfortunately, like all hot dads, he rocks out too hard in the car, drops his icecream on the floor, and goes headlong into an oncoming truck, which kills him instantly. Justice for Mitch, sorry about your shitty son.6. Dawson crying at the dockWas this scene made better or worse by becoming an overexposed meme? Hard to say. But the moment Dawson chose to set Joey free was, by anyone’s measure, heart-wrenching. He had loved her (a version of her he had invented while alone in his bedroom) his whole short life. As he tearfully tells Joey she should turn around and go back to Pacey, we see the first glimpse of a new Dawson, one who knows other people exist and who occasionally acts in their best interests.5. Jen’s goodbye for her daughterNow, I maintain that killing off Jen Lindley in the final episode is a decision that should be tried in the International Court of Justice – and her recorded message to her daughter admitted as evidence. “Well,” she says, as Sarah McLachlan’sAngelplays, “by the time you see this, I won’t be here anymore, and I know how much that sucks for both of us.” This devastating monologue cemented Michelle Williams as a true thespian, even under the direction of a mid-at-best filmmaker like Dawson.4. Joey and Dawson’s first kissJoey’s second-best first kiss finally came at the start of season two. As they wander under fairy lights on a perfect Capeside night, talking about how Joey has sacrificed her own ambition and happiness in case they are soulmates, they come upon nature’s most romantic of settings – a swing set. The rest, as they say, is an unconvincing tongue lashing.3. Joey and Pacey’s first kissEveryone born before 1995 knows Joey and Pacey were endgame. All any red-blooded teenager wanted was for a surly young man with a car to berate her, drive dangerously, shout at her, and then grab her face while teary-eyed and practically bleeding testosterone and kiss her until her eyes watered. Or so I’m told.2. ‘You and me, always’The two-part series finale takes place five years into the future. In a wonderful twist that defied 90s romcoms, Dawson and Joey have not ended up together. I know! But as they reminisce about their wild, stalkerish, often one-sided love story, Dawson realises they’re just a different kind of soulmate. Not the kind you live with, or start a family with, or come home to after a bad day at the office, but the kind that occasionally has a sleepover for old time’s sake. And I think that’s beautiful.1. ‘I remember everything’Season three – the best season – includes the greatest line in the show’s entire run. It’s Anti-Prom, and Joey and Pacey are sharing a dance. How come, he demands, this feels so right? He manhandles her bracelet, explaining it’s just like Joey: elegant, simple, beautiful. It’s her mum’s bracelet, she says – but he already knows. “You remember that?” Joey asks, and Pacey – the greatest human man in all of literature – whispers, “I remember everything.”BE. STILL. MY. HEART.In many ways, Joey was never going to be enough for Pacey. I could have been, obviously, but as the sun sets on Dawson and his creek, I guess we will never know for sure.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But her long shot of a movie landed her the opening slot at theBerlin film festivalstarting Thursday, sending her in the red-carpet footsteps of the likes ofMartin Scorseseand theCoen brothers.Sadat, 35, wrote, directed and stars in the daring, genre-bending film No Good Men, about a budding love affair in a Kabul newsroom on the eve of theTaliban’s return to powerin 2021 and thewest’s chaotic withdrawal.During the years-long gestation of the picture, Sadat found herself stranded on a writing retreat in Germany by the pandemic, then witnessing the febrile last days of democracy inAfghanistan. Finally, she was evacuated to Europe in fear for her life as Kabul fell to the Taliban.She said those tumultuous years in and out of her homeland shaped the kind of movie she wanted to make – paying tribute to women and men finding joy and connection despite tumult, violence and repression.View image in fullscreen‘Afghanistan is always misrepresented by international film-makers’ … No Good Men by Shahrbanoo Sadat (right).Photograph: Virginie Surdej“Afghanistan doesn’t have a film industry and it’s always misrepresented by the films that are being made by international film-makers. The only type of film-making that is expected is a war drama,” she said in a video call from Hamburg where she has resettled.Sadat said that disconnect set her on a unique path as an Afghan director, one that embraced fun and even frank sexuality running counter to western stereotypes. “My life is not a war drama every day. There’s a lot of humour and a lot of comedy. And at the time I began I was with my boyfriend, so there was romance,” she said. “Afghanistan is also like the rest of the world so I decided,you know what, I’m going to make a romcom.”In the film, Sadat plays Naru, the only camerawoman at Kabul’s main TV station, who is separated from her cheating husband and struggling to keep custody of her three-year-old son.At work, Naru is kept from covering hard news until she makes the most of a Valentine’s Day feature she is assigned, capturing women’s unvarnished views about the men in their lives. The station’s most prominent journalist, Qodrat, recognises her talent and begins taking her out in the field. Together they capture the last moments of relative freedom in the city.As they crisscross Kabul, a spark catches between them and Naru starts to question whether it’s really true there are no good men in Afghanistan. “It is really, really difficult to be a good man in Afghan society,” Sadat said. “You get bullied, you get mocked by all the other men who share the same mentality: that women are animals and you have to take control and you have to be the boss, every woman in your family should be afraid of you.”Sadat said depictions on screen almost exclusively reflected that “monster” image. “And I thought: I’m going to make a film which is going to be like a love letter to all these good men I know.”Sadat aimed to depict an urban woman much like herself: strong-willed, financially self-sufficient and chafing at the indignities imposed on her by an ultraconservative tribal society.She also wanted to push back against a tendency to “romanticise the era of democracy” by “putting 100% of blame on the Taliban” for women’s oppression while ignoring the underlying patriarchal structures that endured during the western occupation. “Being a strong woman is not enough if the system doesn’t support you.”In one uproarious scene, an Afghan friend visiting from the US gives Naru a sex toy as a present to celebrate her newfound freedom as a single woman – certainly a first in the history of Afghan cinema. Sadat said she believes a passionate onscreen kiss shared by Naru and Qodrat is also unprecedented.For an Afghan audience, Sadat jokes those kinds of brazen images will make it a “horror film, not a romcom”. But she is confident that despite official censorship and traditional values, Afghans will seek the film out, even if they have to watch it in bits and pieces on TikTok.View image in fullscreenFilm-maker Shahrbanoo Sadat.Photograph: Alexandra PolinaNo Good Men is the third feature by Sadat, who was born in Tehran and moved with her family to a village in central Afghanistan when she was 12. Her debut Wolf and Sheep picked up an award at Cannes in 2016.She said European film institutes were initially reluctant to back No Good Men as a comedy “while brave Afghan women are fighting in the streets of Kabul against the Taliban – like, ‘how dare you?’”.“And I was like, what? I am one of those women and I want to make something and you’re standing against me. How dareyou? I actually feel offended that you feel offended by my project. So it was really kind of comedy itself. A tragicomedy.”She managed to cobble together funding from across Europe and filmed No Good Men in Germany, where she has a temporary visa, using an all-Afghan cast.Berlin film festival directorTricia Tuttlehandpicked No Good Men as the opener of the 76th edition, passing the mantle from some of the world’s top auteurs. Tuttle called Sadat “one of the most exciting voices in world cinema,” noting she “risked so much to get this film made”.Explore more on these topicsBerlin film festival 2026Comedy filmsAfghanistanTalibanWorld cinemaBerlin film festivalFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The exquisitely beautiful, mercurial and prodigiously talented 90s singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley was drawn to the music business. And this contractually demanded endless touring and a multi-album commitment when he’d already poured his twentysomething-year-old life and soul intothe first one, Grace, a hipster-critical smash whose commercial underperformance in the US caused execs to push him ever harder for a follow-up to recoup their investment. The business also created a world where he got to meet his heroes (such as Paul McCartney and Robert Plant), whose extravagant, good-natured praise for him sent this already highly strung young soul over the edge. He was as handsome as Jim Morrison in his sleek prime as well as – to my eye – Adam Ant with a touch of Neil Innes.Amy Berg’s arresting documentary of a death foretold explains how young Jeff and his mother were abandoned when he was an infant by his father,Tim Buckley,a singer and counterculture figure who was to die of a heroin overdose in his late 20s. Jeff was to die at about the same age, in an accidental drowning in Wolf River Harbor, Memphis, Tennessee, in 1997, when he was just 30.His high-spirited mum was in many ways the great love of his life – but it was singing at his dad’s memorial service that astonished the congregation and kickstarted Jeff’s career; he was a superb vocalist with a range and delicacy inspired by Nina Simone and Judy Garland. He was poignantly the very image of his dad; the press treated him like a cover version of his father, and his early dependence on cover versions such asLeonard Cohen’s Hallelujahundermined the development of original material.Berg speaks extensively to his mum, Mary Guibert – the film’s executive producer – and to two of his girlfriends, Rebecca Moore and Joan Wasser. She uses Jeff’s answering machine messages and archive 90s material, including the unmistakable, moody black-and-white MTV footage, to tell a very sad story with sympathy and urgency.It’s Never Over,Jeff Buckleyis in UK and Irish cinemas from 13 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsMusic documentaryJeff BuckleyPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Long before he became a film-maker, the teenage Crowe travelled around the US interviewing some of the biggest rocks acts of the era, among them Gram Parsons, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, the Eagles and the Allman Brothers Band. Crowe’s memoir reveals him as the perennial outsider who, unlike his interviewees, cared little about sex, booze and drugs and who lacked a certainsavoir-faire. Yet rock stars liked having him around, enjoying his sincerity and the fact that he was more admiring fan than dispassionate reporter.Crowe is the reader, delivering a warm and vivacious narration that conveys the wide-eyed astonishment of his youthful self as he is thrust into the orbit of his heroes. He also paints a vivid picture of an era in which bands weren’t protected by gaggles of PR representatives and a writer could spend 18 months with an artist – as Crowe did with Bowie in the mid-1970s – to write a single profile.The book draws to a close shortly after Crowe conducts a filmed interview with Tom Petty. With the video director gone awol, Petty instructs Crowe to pick up the camera and start shooting. In doing so, Crowe stumbles on what turns out to be his ideal medium: “I’d been a music journalist, translating time and space for others to savour. This was an exercise in cutting out the middleman.

That’s a shame, as it possesses emotional depth as well as a swag of memorable arias. Contemporary audiences gave it a warm welcome, though the composer’s last-minute attempt to avoid a diplomatic faux pas by switching settings from medieval Portugal to mythical Lydia hasn’t helped its reputation.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Handel: SosarmeThis lightly sprung performance from Opéra Royal de Versailles under conductor Marco Angioloni goes some way to rehabilitating the work, even if the engineered sound and edgy string tone are a little in-your-face. Rémy Brès-Feuillet is honey-toned in the title role, originally a vehicle for the great contralto castrato Senesino, with Sarah Charles suitably soubrettish as his beloved Elmira.Doubling as vocalist, Angioloni devours a great deal of scenery as the rancorous king of Lydia alongside fine performances from Nicolò Balducci as his rebellious son and Éléonore Pancrazi as his hapless wife. Crowning the set as the duplicitous counsellor Altomaro is young Italian bass Giacomo Nanni. His sonorous account of “Fra l’ombre e gl’orrori”, a classic case of Handel repurposing an earlier hit, reveals a voice of impressive suppleness and power.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicGeorge Frideric HandelOperareviewsShareReuse this content"

A 63-year-old gay philosophy teacher and drag entertainer, he is a stickler for rules and boundaries, living in a tiny Beirut flat with his octogenarian mother, the nosy and unfettered Zalfa. Invited to a writing residency in the US, Raja will use the occasion to relate his life – that is, if you don’t mind him taking the scenic route. “A tale has many tails, and many heads, particularly if it’s true,” Raja tells us. “Like life, it is a river with many branches, rivulets, creeks and distributaries.”Winner of the 2025 US National Book Award for fiction, Alameddine’s seventh novel opens and closes in 2023, but the bulk of its action takes place earlier: encompassing the lead-up to and aftermath of the Lebanese civil war (1975-1990), the Covid pandemic, Lebanon’s 2019 banking crisis, and the Beirut port explosion in 2020. If this timeline makes the book sound like a punishing tour of Lebanese history, I promise it isn’t. More than a war chronicle or national exposé, it is a queer coming-of-age tale, an exploration of the bond between a mother and a son, and a meditation on storytelling, memory, survival and what it means to be truly free. Told in a voice as irresistibly buoyant as it is unapologetically camp, this rule-breaking spin on the trauma plot holds on to its cheer in the face of sobering material. Poignant but never cynical, often dark but never dour, wise without being showy and always eager to crack a joke, this is a novel that insists that the pain of the past need overwhelm neither present nor narrative, identity nor personality. With Sartre as his guide, and a drag fabulousness all his own, Raja shows us how.This rule-breaking spin on the trauma plot holds on to its cheer in the face of sobering materialThe banking collapse and the Covid pandemic are both played as comedies. The former sees an outraged Zalfa taking to the streets as a protest icon: braving teargas, brandishing homemade signs (“This Grandmother Wants All the Brothers of Whores in Jail”) and achieving, to Raja’s consternation, celebrity among his students.When the pandemic arrives, Zalfa finds herself home and bored and, worse still, barred from guest appearances in Raja’s Zoom classes. Zalfa needs people; she needs stories; she needs to be listened to. Who better as a friend, then, than Madame Taweel, the neighbourhood mafia boss and inexhaustible source of gossip? The two become inseparable confidantes, bonding over everything from makeup to low-budget films starring Raja in drag, while Madame Taweel’s armed minions politely stand guard outside.Raja being Raja, of course, does not tell the tale of their friendship straight, prefacing it with a long, only tenuously related tale of his own from 40 years earlier, about a secret lover he had during the war: “Mansour was handsome, hirsute, and hung – very well hung. I rode that beast as often as I could.”The section set before the civil war trades farce for a measured account of Raja’s boyhood, as in a series of scenes – some funny and others heartbreaking – we see him fail familial expectations of masculinity. The home of a Japanese neighbour offers refuge from the chaos and hostility of Raja’s own and opens a window on to a culture he grows to cherish for its order and minimalism.The novel’s bravura centrepiece returns to a memory Raja has long repressed: his captivity during the war at the hands of Boodie, a militiaman just a year older. Fifteen at the time, Raja witnesses a kidnapping that ends in bloodshed; Boodie takes him along to spare his life. Over two months, an ordeal Raja later calls both “horrific” and “exhilarating”, his senses of danger and safety, powerlessness and agency, terror and desire are thoroughly scrambled. Boodie is by turns caring and coercive, violent and tender, and the sex they have provokes in Raja a conflicted mix of shame and joy. The narrative refuses to resolve these contradictions, staging the episode almost as a twisted domestic drama with notes of slapstick.In the novel’s penultimate pages, Raja rejects the label of trauma (“I felt free in that situation. Maybe even happy”), while also refusing the closure of forgiveness. It is not that he cannot forgive Boodie, he says, but that he chooses not to. “I wasn’t hurt because he kept me hostage. I was hurt because I realised I couldn’t participate in a system that seeks to destroy people like us.” Boodie chose to participate in a murderous system: “From the beginning, he chose war.” If anything, what proved traumatic was Raja’s return to a world incapable of accepting him: when he finally managed to escape, he did so, alas, in a dress. Everyone turned away from him except Zalfa.Sartre held, not uncontroversially, that we are condemned to be free: even the worst setbacks and threats we face acquire significance only through our own “project”, the way we commit to being in the world. Raja seems to take this as his mantra. The True True Story of Raja the Gullible (And His Mother) conveys one message compellingly, and it is this simple but radical one: you cannot change what happened. But you can maybe, just maybe, decide what it means.The True True Story of Raja the Gullible (and His Mother) by Rabih Alameddine is published by Corsair (£22).

You might be tempted to think of Star Wars, or perhaps the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Maybe even Harry Potter? But no: it’sPokémon– the others don’t come close. The Japanese “pocket monsters”, which star in video games, TV series and tradable playing cards, have made an estimated $115bn since 1996. Is this a sign of the lamentable infantilisation of postmodern society?Not a bit of it, argues Keza MacDonald, the Guardian’s video games editor, in her winsomely enthusiastic biography ofNintendo, the company that had become an eponym for electronic entertainment long before anyone had heard the words “PlayStation” or “Xbox”. Yes, Pokémon is mostly a children’s pursuit, but a sophisticated one: “Like Harry Potter, the Famous Five and Narnia,” she observes, “it offers a powerful fantasy of self-determination, set in a world almost totally free of adult supervision.” And in its complicated scoring system, “it got millions of kids voluntarily doing a kind of algebra”.Meanwhile, a lot of adults participated in the 2016summer crazefor Pokémon Go, the phone app that led people to walk around looking for imaginary monsters in real places. Pure escapism, perhaps, for people depressed by the deaths of David Bowie and Prince, not to mention the Brexit referendum. But at least it got people out of the house. When getting people to stay in their house became the law four years later, it was Nintendo’s Animal Crossing: New Horizons, a delightful fantasy of village life, that enabled them to socialise remotely, selling 45m copies in 2020.Before all that, of course, there was Mario, the bouncy Italian star of the arcade game Donkey Kong (1981) and countless games since. Dressed in what MacDonald unimprovably calls his “unorthodox plumbing uniform”, Mario is central to what may be the most aesthetically consistent long-running entertainment series ever. (The brilliant 2023 entry,Super MarioBros. Wonder, is a video game that is also a slapstick musical.) His creator, the enigmatic genius Shigeru Miyamoto (now 73 years old), insists that he just thinks of his work as the modest application of common sense, but his colleagues know better, speaking reverently of “Miyamoto magic”.Miyamoto also designed the hit series The Legend of Zelda, inspired by his boyhood love of exploring the countryside, some instalments of which rank among the greatest video games ever created. In one of those curious reversals of association between art and real life, I find to this day that whenever I hear the cawing of a crow, I think of Hyrule Field, an unprecedentedly vast and realistic open space in the 1998 Zelda game Ocarina of Time. MacDonald interviews the lead programmer of that masterpiece, who says adorably of his responsibility for Epona, the hero’s trusty steed: “I worked hard to make her a good horse.”MacDonald’s conversations with all the gifted (and often eccentric) creative people who actually make the games are full of such wholesome insights, as are her own superb analyses of favourite games, and of the general vibe of Nintendo: its “toymaker philosophy” is an antidote, she argues, to the increasingly baleful role that technology plays in all our lives. “In an era where our utopian conception of new technologies has soured,” she writes, “where social media algorithms and a mass of online ‘content’ vie to ensnare our attention for profit … a game like Zelda shows us that technology can instead be enriching: it can create a true alternative world behind the screen.”Nintendo, indeed, has seldom been on the bleeding edge of tech for its own sake. Gunpei Yokoi, the inventor of the handheld Game Boy, described his own design philosophy as “lateral thinking with withered technology”. The company says it has no plans to use generative AI in its games: they would rather focus, Miyamoto says, on “what makes Nintendo special”. And that is its core business of simple joy. As Takashi Tezuka, a producer on Super Mario Bros. Wonder, says to MacDonald: “It’s an action game where you get enjoyment out of discovering how to become better.” In a world over which we have no control, the pleasure of mastery is a rare gift.Super Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Fun by Keza MacDonald is published by Guardian Faber (£20).

The concept is simple: head into a cartoonish paradise full of whimsical creatures, capture them in red-and-white balls and assemble a team of warriors from them, before battling other aspiringPokémonmasters. But the latest entry in the series is different – a game that’s more about building than battling.In Pokopia, a refreshingly pacific twist on the series, players are dropped into a virtual world wherePokémonare freed from their spherical prisons and happily roam their natural habitats. There’s one minor caveat – you have to create those habitats by hand, building them from what you can find.Taking its cues from Nintendo’s all-conqueringAnimal Crossing, this Switch 2 game sees you rebuilding decaying habitats in order to attract new Pokémon to move into your sanctuary. (Players of the Xbox classic Viva Piñata, rejoice.) It’s a welcome departure from the main series’ long-running training and battling loop. Veteran Pokémon developer Shigeru Ohmori, who started thinking about Pokopia’s concept while working on 2022’s Pokémon gamesScarlet and Violet, says that the idea for Pokopia arose after spending many years dreaming about finding Pokémon in tall grass.View image in fullscreen‘A very universal cuteness.’Photograph: Nintendo“The first Pokémon game I worked on was [2003’s] Ruby and Sapphire,” recalls Ohmori with a smile. “My first project for that game was to create the map – and whenever I put grass on to the map, Pokémon appeared on screen. That feeling of Pokémon appearing when creating the habitat, and then meeting those Pokémon, was something that I really cherished.” He created a basic prototype for Pokopia in his spare time, and then Pokémon’s developers Game Freak brought on Dragon Quest Builders 2 studio Omega Force to help.This feeling is lovingly recreated for players in Pokopia. As you create tufts of grass, a Bulbasaur suddenly appears, shuffling his way towards you to say hello. There are no humans to be found anywhere in this virtual utopia. In the strange and initially desolate patch in which you create your Pokémon paradise, you control the adorably wobbling mass of everyone’s favourite shape-shifting jelly, Ditto. Haunted by memories of its former trainer, Ditto decides to take a humanoid shape that you determine in a character creation screen. This is your uncanny-looking avatar, doing its best to approximate a faded memory of a human being.After you’ve customised your Ditto/human-hybrid, you are greeted by a sentient shrub, Professor Tangrowth, complete with a data disc attached to his curly tendrils and a pair of glasses strapped to his chin. The prof informs you that it’s your job to restore this barren land. Where do you begin? In exactly the same way that Ohmori did, all those years ago – by making lush, green grass.View image in fullscreenGrow your own in Pokopia.Photograph: Game Freak/The Pokémon Company/Koei TecmoIn order to create new habitats, Ditto borrows moves from each new creature you meet, mimicking their abilities so that you can till the land. Bulbasaur’s ability transforms Ditto’s appendages into floppy, leaf-producing vines. Squirtle’s water gun sees Ditto puke water like a derpy Roman fountain, and Scyther’s cut blesses Ditto with comically oversized razor-sharp blades for arms. In a nice touch, whenever Ditto learns a new move you’re treated to the classic Pokémon level-up music.For an hour I wander the barren wasteland, working to turn sand into grass and hacking trees for wood. Everything feels effortlessly charming, with a level of care and polish that elevates Pokopia’s opening 60 minutes above the series’ many middling spin-offs. Like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Pokopia also allows you to visit friends’ islands and meet their Poké pals, surfing between lands as a Ditto-Lapras or soaring through the skies in the form of a Dragonite.Marina Ayano, the game’s art director, tells me that she grew up with the franchise – making this something of a dream project. During development, Ayano and the sound director landed on two key words to steer the game’s cutesy and laid-back vibe: “chill and pop”. “Chill is slow and cosy, and pop ensures that everything is colourful … [we wanted] a very universal cuteness,” she says. As I make friends with a Pidgey, build a straw bed for a sleepy Charmander and field a request from an amusingly emo Umbreon who desires a black-painted home, it’s certainly very cute. For Ayano, Pokopia offered a chance to let the cutest Pokémon shine: creatures that are usually cast aside in the mainline games in favour of stronger battlers.View image in fullscreen‘Chill and pop’ … the developers’ key words when building the game.Photograph: Game Freak/The Pokémon Company/Koei TecmoPlaying as a Pokémon rather than the games’ usual human protagonists, you can fully understand – and converse with – every species of Pokémon, and given that Pokémon’s writing is normally pretty bland, the dialogue has unexpected personality. “Because there are no trainers in the game, we really thought about how the Pokémon communicate with each other,” says Takuto Edagawa, Pokopia’s director. “What are they thinking? How are they feeling? We made sure that if you put one piece of furniture anywhere in the world, Pokémon will react based on their personalities. I really liked how it came out.”Pokopia is the first spin-off game that Game Freak has worked on directly, and Ohmori suggests that it may have influenced the direction of future mainline Pokémon games. “Battles have always been the focus, but there are so many [other elements] to these games, and I believe that fans have enjoyed these components as well,” he says. “I would like to show this more and scale the Pokémon games up, outside of battling. And I would like the Pokémon franchise to seek new possibilities to grow the Pokémon world.”Pokopia is released on 5 March; £58.99/$69.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPokémonNintendoNintendo Switch 2Animal CrossingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

InSweet Mambo, the German choreographer’s 2008 production for Tanztheater Wuppertal, their eclectic compilation complements the seductive elegance of set designer Peter Pabst’s huge, billowing white drapes and the sumptuous gowns provided byMarion Cito.Track by track, an entrancing through-line is found in Sámi joiking, torch song, folk, electronica and ambient music. The mix extends to the unclassifiable party sound ofHazmat Modine’s Bahamut, harmonicas and tuba boosting a late burst of loosey-goosey abandon from dancer Daphnis Kokkinos while his colleagues are wrapped and spun upside down in those curtains.View image in fullscreenPop art poses … Julie Shanahan, centre, with Daphnis Kokkinos and Alexander López Guerra.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAn altogether more serene opening bids us to listen closely as Naomi Brito, a dancer who gets better and better, plays a golden singing bowl. Andrey Berezin is duly drawn on stage, moth to her flame. Men pestering women, attraction and repulsion, were lifelong Bausch motifs and made for some hard-to-stomach scenes but here he is swatted gently away before Brito’s beatific solo, with long, silky lines and a luxurious full flow. It sums up the softer edges of Sweet Mambo, where the women’s solos frequently have an inner stillness and the dancers even drift away in hammocks.The handful of harrowing episodes mostly involve Julie Shanahan, who enters caressing herself and adopting stylised poses à la Roy Lichtenstein’s pop art that morph into supernatural malevolence. Later, she is caught in a vicious circle of locked then liberated movement. In a reprised sequence, she strives to reach the end of the stage, repeatedly carried back to the start by men with implacable expressions – either acting dutifully or cruelly. The scenes with Julie Anne Stanzak dragged around the stage by her hair equally evade clearcut definition: it is done at her request and, as they run in circles and a storm rages, the sense is that we are all in this mess together and need each other.View image in fullscreenA dancer who gets better and better … Naomi Brito.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBut Sweet Mambo is also one of Bausch’s funniest shows: Nazareth Panadero, blissfully daft, laughs into a plastic bag and seals it for later use then delivers eccentric aphorisms and tall tales about her neighbour’s parrot. “I feel so empty,” she laments, brandishing a used water-cooler bottle. Berezin returns to a sequence suggesting a helpless plummet through air and this void is at the heart of Pabst’s masterly minimalist design as gusts fill and sculpt a diaphanous sheet, with solos performed inside or adjacent.The sound of Pina BauschRead moreThe billowing backdrop becomes a screen for a projected 1930s German film featuring suave actors but, really, with dancers like this who needs to be distracted by other performers? After the interval, replaying selected routines risks diminishing returns yet the work has concentrated unity – it’s less sprawling than some of the choreographer’s other pieces – and results in a swooningly beautiful night.Pina Bauschcoinciding with Valentine’s Day is a Sadler’s Wells tradition and these dancers treat the audience like lovers, asking us to never forget them, tell them our problems, help them unzip a dress. For newcomers it could be a coup de foudre; long-term Wuppertal watchers may fall in love all over again.AtSadler’s Wells, London, until 21 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsStagePina BauschTheatreSadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Languorous strings and woodwind indulged in voluptuous foreplay, spurred on by priapic brass, only to fall back repeatedly as if momentarily sated. Benjamin exerted an impressive control over his vast forces – nine horns, no less – refining the composer’s unrestrained textures before ramping up the adrenaline for a climactic explosion of hedonistic pleasure.He brought a similar crystalline clarity to Stravinsky’s Symphonies of Wind Instruments, highlighting its startling modernity as if dissecting the fleshless remnants of a deconstructed The Rite of Spring. The LPO, impressive throughout, laid bare the score with the exactitude of a surgeon’s knife. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Ravel’s Mother Goose was presented complete rather than in the usual suite form, every detail cleanly defined. The rarely heard connecting sections were of special interest as Benjamin led the way from Sleeping Beauty’s graceful pavane to the flirtatious chuntering of Beauty and the Beast, the latter burbling away on a delightfully ungainly contrabassoon. The pentatonic tinkling of the Empress of the Pagodas and the throbbing intensity of The Fairy Garden brought the music to its iridescent conclusion.A palimpsest is a manuscript on which one or more later texts have been inscribed on top of an original piece of writing. It’s an idea that could be applied to a great deal of Benjamin’s own work as a composer, making Palimpsest I and its darker cousin, Palimpsest II signature works. An unconventional orchestral layout – eight basses but no cellos, harps, celesta, a large brass section and an ethereal group of upper strings that sounded at times as if they were on helium – makes these unusually visual pieces, their inner workings revealed most effectively in live performance. Benjamin was authoritative here, crafting the music’s tectonic shifts while bringing out its startling peculiarities and rare beauty.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicLondon Philharmonic OrchestraGeorge BenjaminreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is a tragedy of opportunism, of a moment of hubris that spins out of control. For a while, it could go either way.That comes across in this staging, directed by Mark Babych in a three-way co-production withBolton OctagonandDerby theatre. Macbeth strides on, fresh from the battlefield, a modern-day soldier with camouflage colours and an automatic weapon. Played by Oliver Alvin-Wilson, he is as tough as his country needs him to be: serious-minded and professional, but not self-seeking.The idea he might be more than a regular fighter enters him like a poison. Foretold to him by the witches – mix-and-match eccentrics somewhere between rough sleepers and zombies – the prospect of kingship sounds odd and uncomfortable. The taste of ambition is new to him; he swithers this way and that, and it is not inevitable that hunger for power will become his defining characteristic. Then it takes root.View image in fullscreenAs bad as each other … Jo Mousley and Oliver Alvin-Wilson in Macbeth at Hull Truck theatre.It is the same with Jo Mousley as Lady Macbeth. Appearing in a maroon jumper and blue opal necklace, she has a suburban plainness, an ordinary woman thinking on her feet. Like her husband, she comes and goes. When the two of them hatch their murderous plot, they take turns buckling and cajoling, equivocal one moment, certain the next. They are as bad – and as good – as each other. They are well matched.Far from being born tyrants, these Macbeths are an everyday couple taking their chances. The banquet scene looks less like a state dinner than a light supper in a mews apartment, complete with lounge-jazz accompaniment. This could happen to anyone.If Lady Macbeth’s sudden madness has any justification (as ever, it is a little odd), it is that she is out of her depth. Made jittery by any untoward sound, she is not nearly as hard-hearted as she likes to pretend. Dashing out the brains of babies is so much bravado.Performed on a rusty warehouse set designed by Rachael Canning, this GCSE-friendly production is lucid and straightforward. If it does not set the pulse racing, it presents in Alvin-Wilson a thoughtful, reflective Macbeth whose good sense is overcome by blunt rage.AtHull Truckuntil 28 February.

His two most famous paintings, both extremely large and innovative in their composition and technique, were completed while he was still in his mid-20s. As it was, Seurat painted approximately 45 paintings before his death, probably from diphtheria, in March 1891 when he was 31. More than half these works depict the Channel coast and sea and were completed on his summer trips between 1885 and 1890. Seurat and the Sea at the Courtauld is the first exhibition to be devoted entirely to these images. Twenty-three paintings and smaller oil studies, and three drawings hang in two rooms. It is a quietly tremendous exhibition.Even if one takes on board the artist’s claims to science, objectivity and his adherence to theories about colour and perception which distance him from impressionism, Seurat’s paintings are peculiar and strange. Sometimes his line is very odd and stiff, yet his drawings themselves – tonal studies worked in conté crayon on textured, laid paper, are among the most marvellous I can think of. It is clear Seurat knew what he was doing; who knows what he might have gone on to achieve?For all his adherence to the juxtaposition of discrete dots and strokes of pure colour rather than mixed pigments, in order that the human eye would register transitional colours and that the surfaces of his paintings would retain a naturalistic luminosity, Seurat sometimes went overboard with his borders of dots that he added to paintings often years after the original compositions were completed (and which to my eye add little). These strongly and often darkly coloured painted frames, devised and painted by the artist, have now mostly been discarded and lost.View image in fullscreenAn air of the impending … Port-en-Bessin, The Outer Harbour (Low Tide), 1888.Photograph: Saint Louis Art MuseumAs for what came to be called Seurat’s pointillism, his cumulative little strokes and pustules of pigment, which make one aware of the effort and the artifice of his technique, sometimes you sense a kind of veil of interference between yourself and the image. In his small studies, usually painted on little wooden panels, the scale of his marks makes each individual touch count – both in terms of tonality and in its colour value – in the construction of an image. In Seurat’s larger paintings, when the artist is working his way across the undifferentiated expanse of a sandy beach, grass on a clifftop or slack water in a harbour, all that painstaking effort can feel plodding.But when it all comes together, as it often does, that labour turns into something else, and Seurat’s largely emptied-out and unpeopled everyday scenes take on a quivering psychological sense of import. Real or not, you feel his fixation and his stare. There’s something going on beyond the sunny day, the light striking the harbour wall and glinting on the unruffled water, the boat out in the offing, the water stretching away to meet the sky, the bollard by the wall, the stanchions and other bits of metalwork beside a working harbour: everything is happening everywhere all at once, but it all takes time to register.There is also a great deal of pleasure to be found in the anomalies and sometimes puzzling decisions Seurat made. He could be as capricious as he was analytical. The blue sky on one side of The Lighthouse at Honfleur is less saturated than on the other. The view of a regatta at Grandcamp is interrupted by a fabulously unkempt and profuse patch of shrubbery, which creates a terrific foil for the orange jib on the boat just entering the painting to its left. These are the sort of wilful incidents someone might introduce to give pleasure to another painter. Seurat worked with, and played with, the given. But he was careful to paint the brimming brightness of the Channel coast on fine days when the weather had not moved in and the sea and sky became the colour of lead. On those days, I suppose, he stayed in and worked on his drawings and his yet unfinished canvases.View image in fullscreenA sense of the artist wandering the small town alone … Port-en-Bessin, 1888.Photograph: Minneapolis Institute of ArtThe new semaphore on its clifftop gantry at Port-en-Bessin sits in the top left-hand corner of the canvas, almost out of view, so that the eye almost clambers to find it. The entire series of six paintings Seurat completed in Port-en-Bessin, north of Bayeux, in the summer of 1888 have been bought back together for the first time since an exhibition in Brussels the following year. One gets a sense of the artist wandering the small town alone, noticing things. The pennants and French flags flapping wildly on the masts of boats moored in the inner harbour, while the water itself is perfectly calm. A few stick-like figures crossing a bridge in the distance. Another view, from the other side of the bridge, shows three figures in the foreground, a man walking, head down, a woman carrying a pannier, and a small child, alone and as stilted as a mannequin. Other solitaries loiter about in the distance, as casual as they are posed. There’s an air of the impending, of something about to happen. In another painting we are up on the cliff, observing the same scene from yet another point of view, and in another, we turn to watch sailing boats pass between lovely ovoid pools of shadow cast on the water by small clouds which we can’t see.All the while I think of Seurat, another solitary, with his portable, handheld paint box and a little panel, on which he lays out the scene, wedged into its lid. You think of him painting the light, but he is just as interested in the topography, the shapes of things, the bollards and lamp-posts, the new bridge and the cast-iron pillared fish market. Two summers later, in 1890, the artist is at Gravelines, a flat coastal area between Calais and Dunkirk. By now, his paintings are prickling and erupting with his little painted dots. The North Sea light is milky, turned down a notch from his summers farther south. A boat moves down the Channel at evening. There’s no one about in this violet hour, the sun gone, only the man on the boat and, I suppose, the painter following its progress.Seurat’s paintings are full of things – light, colour, objects and atmosphere and a sense of place, but what he has most of all is a wonderful feel for emptiness. It is there in the lassitude of the National Gallery’sBathers at Asnières (1884), and in the crowded stylisations ofA Sunday on La Grande Jatte (1884-6) just as much as it is in the seascapes. Sometimes I think I’m watching Seurat’s paintings as much as I’m looking at them, weaving through them, unseen and unnoticed, between his blizzards of light.At theCourtauld Gallery, London, from 13 February to 17 May.Explore more on these topicsArt and designArtExhibitionsPaintingreviewsShareReuse this content"

The studio, which is now fielding takeover bids from Netflix and Paramount, also boasts the two key contenders at this year’s Oscars: Sinners and One Battle After Another.Sinners broke the record for Academy Award nominations, with 16, while its rival remains favourite to take the best picture and director prizes.

Wuthering Heights reunites her with Elordi (as Heathcliff) as well as Saltburn producerMargot Robbie, who plays Catherine in the new film.Fennell has stressed that the adaptation, which takes considerable liberties with Emily Brontë’s source novel, is a personal interpretation of the book, inspired by her feelings about it when she first encountered it as a teenager.Reviews have been mixed, with many US pundits praising its ambition and idiosyncrasies, while UK critics have in the main been more sceptical.In his two-star review, the Guardian’s Peter Bradshawcalledit “a 20-page fashion shoot of relentless silliness, with bodices ripped to shreds and a saucy slap of BDSM”.Disquiet has already been voiced over the film’s intentional anachronisms, as well as the casting of Robbie and Elordi, both of whom are considerably older than the characters in the novel. Elordi’s casting met with further backlash as Heathcliff is most commonly described by Brontë as “dark-skinned”.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryWarner BrosWuthering HeightsEmerald FennellMargot RobbieJacob ElordiShareReuse this content"

He explains why the history remains unfinishedBlake SimonsThu 12 Feb 2026 06.10 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleThe so-called “Blue Boy trial” in 1965 was a landmark moment for trans visibility inJapan. Now it has become a landmark film, directed by Kasho Iizuka, a transgender man and one of very few queer film-makers working in the commercial Japanese film industry.View image in fullscreen‘I felt that present-day Japanese people ought to know that these people existed’ … Kasho Iizuka.The original legal caseconcerned a doctor who was prosecuted for performing gender reassignment surgery on transgender women, amid law enforcement frustrations that female-presenting transgender sex workers could not be prosecuted for their profession due to their being legally male. The doctor was found guilty of violating Japan’s eugenics laws, which prohibited surgeries resulting in sterilisation if they were deemed inessential. “Blue Boy”was a slang term for transgender individuals assigned male at birth, and the verdict effectively outlawed gender reassignment surgery in Japan until 1998. Despite this, the case raised the domestic profile of transgender people.“The trial has slipped into obscurity in Japan, but I’ve known about it since I first became aware of my identity,” says Iizuka. “These days in Japan you can hear the term LGBTQ in everyday conversation. Back in the 60s, when no such terms were used, there were still people who bravely lived openly [queer] lives. I felt that present-day Japanese people ought to know that these people existed.”Iizuka made his feature film debut in 2011, but his pitches of transgender stories were for the most part unsuccessful at first. Then later in the decade, films about transgender individuals became something of a trend, with films such as Naoko Ogigami’s Close-Knit and Eiji Uchida’s Midnight Swan shining a spotlight on issues facing trans people. “There was a problem with that trend,” says Iizuka. “Transgender tragedy was used as entertainment, and their existence was depicted in a one-dimensional, othered way.” Nonetheless, the success of these films meant that Blue Boy Trial was greenlit. Distributed by major studio Nikkatsu, it is a landmark Japanese film.View image in fullscreenBlue Boy Trial is touring the UK.Photograph: © 2025 “Blue Boy Trial” Film PartnersUnlike its domestic forebears, which cast cisgender men in archetypal transfeminine roles, Blue Boy Trial features trans actors – many non-professional – in trans roles, and seeks to represent a broad spectrum of experiences. “The characters are equally inspired by present-day transgender women and those of the 1960s,” says Iizuka. There was little archival material to consult, with Iizuka turning to weekly magazines and newspapers to understand the set of characters. “As I researched, I found that transgender women of the 1960s had similarly varied attitudes towards their own identities. Some were open; some treated their trans identity as a secret.”Iizuka says there were significant differences in the way they dealt with society. “Transgender women in 1960s Japan tended to overexpress their femininity to be accepted as women,” he says. “But it was important to us to emphasise the commonality between then and now.”Iizuka and his co-writers grew just as interested in those opposed to trans people, and their deeper research pointed to Japan’s wartime experience as a potential reason for the backlash. “Men should be men, and strong – they internalised these values,” says Iizuka. “I don’t think the blame lies with the individual, I think it was a wider problem.”View image in fullscreen‘The characters are equally inspired by present-day transgender women and those of the 1960s.’Photograph: © 2025 “Blue Boy Trial” Film PartnersIizuka hopes his film will inspire further change, and it’s heartening to see that Blue Boy Trial may not be an isolated case in Japan. A biopic oftransgender TV personality Ai Haruna, This Is I, is currently showing on Netflix. Its director, Yusaku Matsumoto, is not transgender himself, but he consulted queer voices to ensure sensitivity and accuracy. “I do think this is a wave,” says Iizuka. “I’ve received proposals for new projects that would cast transgender actors. There’s momentum.”This cultural momentum is aided greatly by domestic advances in trans rights. In 2023, mandatory sterilisation for trans-identifying individualswas deemed unconstitutional by the Japanese supreme court. “The 2023 rulings were milestones for the transgender community, but we’ve faced a backlash,” says Iizuka. “There have been fears around how we maintain safety for women’s spaces, and there are difficulties around changing gender markers on family registers. We’re in a transitional phase. Blue Boy Trial is my gesture as a transgender artist. I hope this film will help society change in a positive direction.”Blue Boy Trial is at Home, Manchester, as part of the Japan Foundation touring film programme 2026, andtours the UKuntil 26 March.

I didn’t have one of those. It wasn’t until I was 24 and living in Paris, where I stumbled into Philippe’s class almost by accident, that this happened. Provocative, demanding, deliberately inappropriate and utterly hilarious, Philippe taught me not to carry anything. No baggage, no ideas; knowing nothing is all you need. Because we are all ridiculous.His mother was Spanish, and we would eat her meals with relish when she came to cook for him, or rather with him, in hisappartementlined with his writings, many of which had “rêves” inscribed on the spine. He would refer to his father as “ce salaud bourgeois” (that bourgeois arsehole) and he delighted in telling me the story of being thrown out of school aged eight because he punched the gymnastics teacher who was trying to instil discipline into young boys by turning them into military martinets.Of the professions and attitudes that merited his ire – the military, the church, hypocrisy, sham, inauthenticity, politicians, academics and fascists – “collaborateurs” had a special place in his heart. For a boy who grew up in postwar France, this slur was reserved for the most deserving. “C’est un collabo de merde de chien” – a dog-shit collaborator, though that translation does nothing for the pleasurable disgust and gastronomic relish with which he spat these words out from under his moustache.View image in fullscreen‘Moi, je suis le professeur’ … Philippe Gaulier.Photograph: Courtesy of the artistThe moustache, a tangled mass of straggling unruly black wire obscuring the entire region between his nose and his lower lip, was immediately fascinating to me at my first meeting, on a cold November evening in 1980 at his studio in Rue Alfred de Vigny.

Then the wild hair, a bright green sagging sweater, ageing boots and eyes (framed by round glasses) that missed nothing, took nothing seriously and ferociously studied every possibility of the hilarious or the pretentious.The room was full of people who didn’t know what to expect but who had heard there was somethingPhilippe Gaulierwas offering you couldn’t get anywhere else.I shook his hand.Pause.Look.“Bonsoir.”“Bonsoir.”Pause.Look.“You arre eeengleesh?”“Yes … er … Oui.”“Tout le monde a des problèmes.”What did he just say? Everyone has problems? Hand still held. Eyes sparkling.Wicked laughter.First lesson.“Moi,” placing his hand on his belly, “moi, je suis le professeur, vous … vous êtes des élèves.”Rules were established. Rules of the game. The game from the outset was that he was the teacher, you were the pupils. The gymnastics teacher was parodied, the relationship of power was offered as a structure to be undermined and shattered with laughter.Philippe Gaulier had a huge impact on theatre – but his ‘embrace the ridiculous’ lesson is one for us allRead moreThere was no style, no set ideas, each person was scrupulously attended to, taken apart, built up again, invited, insulted, cajoled, delighted and, most importantly, played with. He would play with each of us with infinite generosity, stomach-aching hilarity, indefatigable persistence and utterly spontaneous flexibility.We learned to fail, and start again; we learned to jettison our own ideas, because ideas were never the problem, only performing them. When people laugh at you, it reveals a truth, which is why we hate being laughed at in real life. But with Philippe we could learn that failing to embrace this vulnerable sense of exposure was inimical to revealing our humanity.Sharing this fallibility in a complicitous relationship with the audience is a radical act; an anarchic joining to be found in no other art form.“If an actor has forgotten what it is like to play as a child, they should not be an actor,” he would say to me as he took me to the bar in the lunch break before the afternoon session. At that point he had decided I was his assistant and we needed to discuss the serious business of the afternoon session.“Tiens, mon petit, on va chercher de l’inspiration.”Then, leaning across the bar, pipe in mouth …“Deux grands martini gins …”Explore more on these topicsTheatrePhilippe GaulierCompliciteSimon McBurneyClownsComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)featuresShareReuse this content"

Not an easy task, when environmental concerns are slipping down the global agenda and fashion, perennially a mirror to the world we live in, has reverted to putting profits first.“I’m an optimist, but it’s not a blind optimism. There’s a lot of tension in optimism, because the world is challenging and I am not ignoring that. My optimism comes from believing that the young people of today are going to make this world better,” he said before Wednesday’s show, held in the historic Cunard building in downtown New York.A decade ago, Vevers felt guilty about working in fashion. “It was starting to eat at me. I was struggling with it. One day I realised: don’t feel guilty, take action. That was the gamechanger for me. I still don’t have all the answers by any means, but every day, I’m thinking about it and working on it, and we’re making progress.”View image in fullscreenStuart Vevers on the runway with his son during New York fashion week.Photograph: WWD/Getty ImagesSo the ripped jeans on the gender-fluid catwalk were not artfully distressed, but entirely made from post-consumer denim. Leather handbags looked like beaten-up baseball gloves because they were actually made from vintage baseball gloves. “The funny thing is, the older the baseball glove, the more beautiful the bag ends up looking,” Vevers noted backstage.In Coach stores, upcycled denim has been scaled from capsule collections, and is beginning to make up a “meaningful” segment of the brand’s offering, Vevers said. “There are some really great materials already out there in the world, and my team and I have the creative ideas to refresh them and make them feel new again.” Trench coats made from old chinos have recently gone on sale. Last year, Coach partnered with Bank & Vogue, the parent company of Beyond Retro, to produce handbags made from upcycled corduroy, as part of an initiative to promote circularity in fashion and reduce landfill.View image in fullscreenModels backstage show off Coach’s pre-loved leather.Photograph: Lexie Moreland/WWD/Getty ImagesThe show was dedicated to Fawn, Vevers’ nine-day-old daughter, and inspired by a Christmas afternoon that he and his husband spent watching The Wizard of Oz with their five-year-old twins, River and Vivienne. “Watching that film at Christmas was a tradition I grew up with, and when I watched it with my kids, seeing their reaction when the film switches from black-and-white to colour sparked something in me.”‘A catalyst for change’: how sustainable Copenhagen became fashion’s ‘fifth city’Read moreSo the show began with 10 monochrome looks, before bursting into colour with a pillarbox red shirt. Coach, which began as a family-run workshop in New York in 1941, now melds influences from past decades of American youth culture with a distinctive gen Z sensibility. Midcentury varsity jackets are worn with baggy, 1990s skate shorts. The styling – gender-fluid, defiantly anti-polished – is part punk, part grunge. On their feet, models wore frayed sport socks with scuffed trainers, the laces removed and replaced by the snaffle hardware that Coach’s first designer, Bonnie Cashin, made a house signature in the 1960s.Vevers, who was born in Yorkshire, was last year made an OBE for his services to fashion and transatlantic creative relations. His antennae for youth culture tracks with Coach’s astute pricing strategy, which has targeted consumers who have been left behind by the luxury inflation that have seen the price of top-tier handbags rise out of reach. (At Chanel, leather handbags now start at about £5,000.) Coach’s sales grew 25% to $2.1bn in the last three months of 2025.Explore more on these topicsNew York fashion weekFashion weeksLandfillWastefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I call it the “Monster”. It feels as if there are thousands of T-shirts, trousers and sweatshirts always stacked there. I hate it.I don’t know how she finds anything. Also, it’s a pain: the chair is between the bed and my side of the wardrobe, and sometimes the pile is so huge that it stops me from accessing my own clothes. Mabel has too many clothes and she needs to sort out her things. I do ask her nicely to put her clothes in the wardrobe, but she never responds well.Because I work away from home for half of the week, Mabel believes she has a monopoly over our apartment. I don’t agree. We both pay to live here, and when I come home I need to be able to use the bedroom too.When I’m in a rush and need some clothes to go to work or the gym, I get really angry if I can’t open the wardrobe. Mabel then finds a quick fix – she will move the chair and arrange some of the clothes. But the Monster never goes away. It’s always there, lurking. Sometimes it shrinks, but it never entirely disappears.I can’t understand how anyone can live like Mabel all the time, with clothes strewn everywhereI am quite tidy and only leave my clothes in our wardrobe or drawers. I can’t understand how anyone can live like Mabel, with clothes strewn everywhere. She’s usually late getting ready for anything, and it’s all because of the Monster. She takes twice as long as me to find anything in our bedroom.We have two teenage sons, Erik and Michael, and they are just as messy as their mum. When I ask them to tidy their room, they say: “Look at Mum’s room. Why should I clean mine?”The rest of the family like to live in squalor, and I’m the tidy one, so I can’t lay down the law because I am outnumbered. But when it comes to our bedroom, I’d love Mabel to sort out the Monster once a month at least. She doesn’t have to get rid of it. Just review it monthly to keep it under control, so I don’t have a freakout every time I can’t access my own things.The defence: MabelKevin is exaggerating the size of thepile. I likeliving in organised chaos and he should accept thatYes, the Monster is a permanent fixture in the bedroom. But it’s just how I work. I know what’s in the pile at any given time. I find it easier than relying on a wardrobe. I just fling things on top of one another, and then pull them apart when I need to find something.Kevin is exaggerating when he says he can’t access his bit of the wardrobe. All he needs to do is move the Monster to the side a little. Then he’ll be able to open the door.What really annoys me is Kevin’s expectation that I should take all the clothes off the chair, or arrange them to his liking. I don’t have time for that. And because he’s not at home three days a week, I think: “Why should I?”He doesn’t occupy the bedroom as much as I do, so it’s unrealistic to expect me to keep it to his liking. When he needs to access his bit of the wardrobe, I do move the chair to the side, but this is just how I like to live, so he needs to accept that.I change clothes three times a day, so it makes more sense to keep them out where I can see themI change clothes three times a day, so it makes more sense to keep everything out where I can see it all, rather than have to take clothes from the hangers in the wardrobe and put them back up every day. That’s a hassle. Besides, keeping everything on the chair means I can see what’s available at any given time.At the moment, the bedroom is organised chaos, and that’s how I like it. I’m working from home as a therapist, and I also look after our two boys, so I am home more than Kevin. I run the house how I want, and the rest of it is clean and tidy.Kevin and I have been together for 25 years and we know just how to annoy each other. He hates that our two sons are similar to me. They like to leave all their stuff out and I don’t tell them off about it. It’s just how we live. My mum was the same – she raised me to keep my stuff in my room and as long as it was out of sight then it was fine. Kevin isn’t around so much, so he doesn’t get a say.The jury of Guardian readersShould Mabel slay theMonster?I have a fluctuating pile of clean clothes next to my wardrobe that infuriates my partner. However, all Kevin is actually asking for is a monthly sort out, which feels reasonable to me. Also, why are you changing your clothes three times daily? That feels like a crime in itself.Delilah, 36The last line is telling: “Kevin isn’t around much so he doesn’t get a say.” As a therapist, Mabel should consider whether “the Monster” represents deeper unresolved issues around responsibility in their relationship. Like Mabel, I’m naturally messy, but dismissing the impact of this on her partner feels disrespectful. Perhaps the monster needs to go in a box?Marylyn, 41The Monster isn’t a system, it’s a lifestyle choice imposed on everyone else. Blocking a wardrobe and calling it “how I work” isn’t compromise. Kevin’s tone is sharp, but after years of chair-based anarchy, he deserves a medal for his patience.Anna, 31Mabel doesn’t seem to care what Kevin thinks at all, and her argument that he isn’t around as much makes me sad. Why shouldn’t he come home to a tidy bedroom? It’s his home too. Also, why does Mabel change her clothes three times a day?!Andrew 43This sounds like a nightmare! A relationship is about compromise. Mabel, chuck the monster or you may find Kevin doesn’t come home at all one day!Mary 65Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: should Mabel put her clothes away?The poll closes on Wednesday 18 February at 9am GMTLast week’s resultsWe asked whether Frantz should join Frida and get on his bike, rather than walking everywhere.6%of you said yes –Frantz is guilty94%of you said no –Frantz is innocentExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.However, even squeezing in “brisk walks” can be a chore, with busy schedules and increasingly desk-bound jobs forcing more of us to remain sedentary for long periods. That is where walking pads come in, being lighter, smaller and often easier to store than bulky and tricky-to-manoeuvre running treadmills.When coupled with a standing desk, walking pads can be used while working – or when watching TV in the evening. Just a couple of 30-minute sessions add thousands of steps to your daily tally. In fact, a 60-minute walk at an easy 3km an hour can burn between 200 and 300 additional calories, helping those who want to improve their fitness and tone up without the sweatiness and inconvenience of a full-on treadmill session.Walking pads are often cheaper than full-size treadmills, simple to use and relatively easy to store, and they’re perfect for adding more movement to your life without having to give up the day job.At a glanceBestwalking pad overall:JTX MoveLight£499 at JTX FitnessBest budget walking pad and best for beginners:Urevo Strol 2E£239.99 at AmazonBest foldable walking pad:BodyMax WP60£549 at AmazonBest walking pad for incline:Mobvoi Home Treadmill Plus£179.99 at MobvoiWhy you should trust meI’m a keen fitness fan who does everything from gym-based strength training and kickboxing classes to outdoor trail runs and cold-water surfing. As a result, I’ve often been tasked with testing fitness technology for industry magazines.I’ve always been one to get stuck in, whatever I’m testing, whether that means surfing in the latest smartwatch or feeling the burn to test a set of connected kettlebells.I’m a strong believer that you need to live with new-fangled tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I’ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the right environment. With walking pads, that meant strolling along, racking up the steps and burning calories – even while I wrote up this feature.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach walking pad was shoehorned into daily life for at least three days of testing.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianThere was only one way to properly trial the five walking treadmills we selected for this test, and that’s to mimic the customer journey by ordering, taking delivery, unboxing, setting them up and then shoehorning them into daily life.The best walking treadmills – or walking pads – aren’t quite as bulky asregular running treadmills, so I could have multiple models on the go at home at once: one under my desk, one in front of the television and one in my wife’s office upstairs, rotating through them to ensure the same time – at least three days – was spent on each.The testing process meant a lot of additional steps and – in some cases at least – a whining soundtrack that drowned out whatever Netflix series the family was attempting to enjoy. Besides general observations on the heft, ease of storage, quietness, ease of operation and build quality, I tested any additional features available, such as incline, speed adjustments and any remote controls or apps.To get a good idea of energy consumption and the overall cost of running a walking treadmill, I plugged each unit into a power meter, which offered real-time readouts on energy use, and calculated the cost based on my energy tariff.Here are the four best walking pads you can buy now.The best walking pads and under-desk treadmills in 2026View image in fullscreen‘It feels like a walking pad that will go the distance’: the JTX MoveLight.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianBest walking pad overall:JTX MoveLightJTXMoveLight£499£499 at JTX FitnessWhat we loveGreat build quality and crisp displayWhat we don’t loveIt’s heavy and awkward to move aroundPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£499 at JTX FitnessJTX tends to appear in the “best value” section of most reviews of home fitness equipment. The brand is known for offering affordability and reliable build quality, but lacks eye candy and technological flourishes.The MoveLight walking pad is different, though. It happens to be one of the most expensive walking pads we tested. At almost 30kg, it’s also one of the heaviest.That’s no bad thing, though: there’s a tangible difference in the build quality when compared with cheaper walking pads. The JTX also offers a sizeable display, cushioned walking deck and quiet 1hp electric motor. It’s a solid treadmill offering speeds of up to 6km/h, meaning it’s possible to use it for slow jogging without the worry of it falling apart.Why we love itThe MoveLight is similar in design to the BodyMax reviewed below and has a solid plastic chassis that gives it a more premium feel than its cheaper rivals. There’s also a generous running deck area.The extra-large LED console is easy to use and neatly scrolls through speed, time and step count information as you walk. The shrill beeps upon startup and when you adjust the speed do become tiresome, though. Any office mates will want to throw a pencil at you.A small plastic remote allows you to adjust the speed, stop or start the unit and scroll the display between distance, calories and time on one half, and speed and step count on the other.The 1hp motor is powerful enough to propel the deck up to 6km/h, where it remains much quieter than some of the others tested. The deck cushioning is also tangible underfoot, offering a nice spring that makes longer walking sessions more comfortable.Overall, it feels like a walking pad that will go the distance – and so it should, given the price – but that solid build also makes it a pain to move around the house, with the overall weight requiring serious muscle to tip it up on to its wheels. It also doesn’t fold like the similarly priced BodyMax machine.Oh, and one final public service announcement: those with wooden floors will want to take care that the wheels and plastic feet don’t scratch the surface during transport.During testing, we found it to be slightly more power-hungry than rivals, supping about 100W at 3.5km/h, meaning it costs about 3p an hour to power – or about 90p a month if used for an hour each day.It’s a shame that …it’s so big and heavy to move around, which makes storing it after each session a chore.Size:147 x 60 x 12.5cm (LWH)Weight:29.5kgWalking deck size:45 x 122cmMaximum user weight:100kgIncline:noneMaximum speed:6km/hFolding:noJTXMoveLight£499£499 at JTX FitnessWhat we loveGreat build quality and crisp displayWhat we don’t loveIt’s heavy and awkward to move aroundBest budget walking pad and best for beginners:Urevo Strol 2EUrevoStrol 2E£239.99£239.99 at AmazonWhat we loveEasy to move around and store when not in useWhat we don’t loveA short belt that’s not suitable for for taller usersPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£239.99 at AmazonIt’s difficult to separate the Strol 2E from the Mobvoi below, with both opting for a slimline, folding handle design that allows them to transform from simple under-desk walking pads to more traditional running treadmills.Built of sturdier stuff than its doppelganger, the Strol also brings an impressive digital offering into the mix with the Urevo smartphone and tablet app. This provides free virtual walks and collates daily, weekly and monthly workout information.With an impressively quiet and powerful 2.25hp electric motor and plenty of shock absorption underfoot, it’s a great way to rack up additional steps during the day, whether from speedier walking sessions or even light jogs.Why we love itAside from representing excellent value for money, the Strol 2E is smaller, easier to store and less of a task to move around the house than some of its counterparts. Its slim profile means it will slip under a sofa or bed when not in use.The downside of this is a small walking deck, which is particularly lacking in length. This makes it easy to run out of room if you have longer legs, and makes faster running sessions particularly awkward for anyone taller than 5ft. Urevo opts for a folding handle that flips up in running mode. This includes a magnetic safety catch that clips to your clothes and automatically shuts off the unit if you inadvertently run out of deck space.Aside from the quiet operation, well-cushioned walking surface and low power consumption, the Strol 2E is also one of the most technologically accomplished walking pads on this list. The free-to-download app offers virtual walks and allows you to set workouts based on time, step and calorie goals. You can control the speed of the treadmill from your phone or tablet, or use a slick remote control that can also turn off the annoying beeps at the press of a button.It comes with a plastic device holder that can be clipped on to the safety handle for bingeing Netflix or enjoying one of those scenic virtual tours – although you’ll need headphones because there’s no built-in speaker. For the price, it’s an accomplished package and excellent value for money.It’s a shame that …the belt is so short, making it awkward to run on. Taller users will probably find the walking deck too small for longer strides, too.Size:122 x 57 x 99cm (LWH)Weight:21.4kgWalking deck size:38 x 102cmMaximum user weight:120kgIncline:noneMaximum speed:10km/hFolding:yes – safety handle for runningUrevoStrol 2E£239.99£239.99 at AmazonWhat we loveEasy to move around and store when not in useWhat we don’t loveA short belt that’s not suitable for for taller usersPrefer to sit while you work?

It’s the only model that genuinely folds in half, making it easier to squeeze into a cupboard or wardrobe.However, weighing the best part of 30kg, it’s not the easiest to move, despite wheels at the front that allow it to be tipped on its end and rolled around.Potential portability issues aside, this machine offers a fantastic walking experience, with a neat, bright and easy-to-read LED panel that gives clear and scrolling readouts of workout time, distance, speed and average calorie burn.Very much the Porsche of the walking pad world, the BodyMax unit combines stylish looks and powerful performance – but it does require deep pockets.Why we love itAs with most walking pads tested here, it comes with a small remote control to adjust the speed, but there’s also a clever automatic mode – or A Mode – that senses the foot placement and automatically adjusts the speed.Remain in the middle of the deck, and the walking pad will keep the same pace; walk towards the front, and it speeds up; hang back, and it slows things down. This is a really handy feature, meaning you won’t be constantly distracted by irksome remote-control fiddling.The deck itself is nicely cushioned, and the motor is among the quietest on test. It feels like BodyMax hasn’t scrimped on materials, nor has it been distracted by Bluetooth speakers and other gimmicks, which can’t be said for all.Those wanting their walking pad to double up as a running treadmill may be disappointed: the WP60 tops out at 6km/h, which is a very fast walking pace but a slow jog for most. Not a single walking pad I’ve tested has done a convincing job as a running treadmill, though, being either too flimsy underfoot, too noisy or simply not built to withstand the endless thumping of a sprint session.If you’re seeking robust build quality, the BodyMax WP60 walking pad is well worth the additional outlay. As it folds in half, it can be tucked under a desk or rested against a wall when not in use.It’s a shame that …it’s heavy and awkward to move around when folded, and it’s expensive.Size:143 x 55 x 13cm (LWH)Weight:28kgWalking deck size:42 x 120cmMaximum user weight:100kgIncline:noneMaximum speed:6km/hFolding:yes, folds in half for storageBodyMaxWP60£549£549 at AmazonWhat we loveA cushioned deck makes light jogging a breezeWhat we don’t loveIt’s very heavy and a lot more expensive compared with rivalsBest walking pad for incline:Mobvoi Home Treadmill PlusMobvoiHome Treadmill Plus£179.99£179.99 at MobvoiWhat we loveThe extending handrail is a nice safety additionWhat we don’t loveThe minimal incline isn’t worth the extra expensePhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£179.99 at MobvoiMobvoi is best known for itsTicWatchline of fitness-tracking smartwatches and good-valuewireless headphones, but it also offers a small range of domestic treadmills in the UK.One of the most versatile is the Home Treadmill Plus. This pad offers a slightly larger walking deck area than the brand’sHome Treadmill SE, as well as the ability to add a small amount of incline thanks to flip-out feet for height.The build quality is good for the price, and the setup process is painless, while a decent spread of speeds and the ability to transform it into a more traditional running machine (with a folding handrail) make it a versatile choice for home users.Why we love itMobvoi manages to make its Home Treadmill Plus feel relatively premium and well built without sending the price soaring.It’s ready to use out of the box (although that box is heavy, so get someone to help), with wheels at one end to make it easier to move around the home – especially if you have hard floors. You wouldn’t want to keep lugging it up and down the stairs, though.When “folded” into walking mode, the built-in handrail lies flat, allowing you to slide it under a standing desk. From here, you control it with a small remote control to adjust the speed and turn the machine on and off.It doesn’t fold in half for storage, but the slim side profile means it will slide under a sofa or bed, so long as you have 12cm or more of clearance.It includes a safety mechanism for running that clips to your clothes and attaches to a specific point on the machine with a strong magnet, as you’d get on a gym running machine. There’s no way of safely attaching it when the handrail is tucked away in walking mode, however, so it will continue to operate even if you step off it. Most walking pads are the same, but it always strikes me as a bit dangerous.When extending the handrail and pushing the 2.5hp electric motor to its 12km/h top speed, however, that emergency cord could well come in handy. While it’s nice that it reaches a running pace that’s so fast – feeling like a sprint for many – it’s not really designed for long and arduous sprint sessions. The running deck isn’t big enough, and there isn’t much in the way of shock absorption. I tried running on a couple of occasions but always found the experience a tad claustrophobic, not to mention noisy and generally a bit flimsy-feeling underfoot – particularly when maxing out the speed.The pad does offer an efficient and quiet way of racking up the step count while engaging in side tasks. The fold-out incline legs are a nice touch because adding a small incline helps burn more calories and work different leg muscles.In terms of efficiency, I found it drew around 80W of power at a sedate 3.5km/h speed, meaning it will cost a couple of pence to run for an hour a day on most common tariffs.Other niceties include Bluetooth functionality, allowing it to pair with virtual workout software such asZwift, while a built-in speaker allows music to be streamed from a smartphone. That said, the speaker isn’t great – you’d be far better off with a good pair ofheadphonesinstead.It’s a shame that …it’s heavy to move around, the remote is hit-and-miss, and the legs add only a tiny bit of incline.Size:138cm x 64cm x 12cm (113cm in running mode) (LWH)Weight:24.6kgWalking deck size: 42 x 102cmMaximum user weight:120kgIncline:six degreesMaximum speed:12km/hFolding:yes – safety handle for runningMobvoiHome Treadmill Plus£179.99£179.99 at MobvoiWhat we loveThe extending handrail is a nice safety additionWhat we don’t loveThe minimal incline isn’t worth the extra expenseWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenUsing a walking pad for an hour each day should only add about £10 a year to your energy bills.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianHow much should I spend?Prices vary when it comes to walking pads, with the most affordable costing about £100. Anything less than that is unlikely to last until the end of the month. From my testing, the sweet spot seems to be about £250, where you can get a good blend of value and decent build quality. Some of the best we tested were, predictably, among the most expensive. These high-end models typically cost about £500.How much room do you need?If you’ve got good clearance underneath a bed or sofa, most walking pads will happily slide underneath without the need to fold them up. Imagine a slimmed-down treadmill without the safety handle, and you’re basically there.Models like those from BodyMax fold in half, which drastically reduces the length (or height, depending on how you store it), making it much easier to slide into more compact spaces such as a cupboard or wardrobe. But bear in mind the overall weight – many weigh up to 30kg, so they can be tricky to move without help.How easy is it to maintain a walking pad?Most walking pads come with a small bottle of silicone oil provided. This is used to lubricate the underside of the rubber deck every couple of months to ensure smooth movement. Most manufacturers also supply the required hex key so you can tighten the belt if it’s slipping or has moved slightly off-centre.Quickly check the deck alignment and any moving parts every couple of months, and it should be enough to keep a walking pad running smoothly for years.Do walking pads use a lot of electricity?Walking pads use much less powerful motors than their running treadmill counterparts, and they often do away with power-sapping incline motors and connected Bluetooth features that can see electricity bills spiral.During testing, most walking pads drew between 70 and 100W at a relatively standard 3km/h walking pace. This figure increased slightly as the speed increased.Using a walking pad for an hour each day at those sorts of figures equates to about 2-3p a day – or about £10 a year. Much cheaper than a gym membership, but more costly than getting out in nature.Can I run on a walking pad?Some walking pad speeds are capped at about 6km/h, which makes running on them tricky. A plodding jog is a better description.Some walking pads we tested did reach much higher speeds, but most came with a folding safety handle that extends to allow them to safely reach those speeds, giving the runner something to hang on to should the worst happen. These also came with a separate safety system: a small magnetic tag that attaches to clothing. If this becomes detached, the machine shuts off.The general build and robustness of walking pads aren’t up there with their running-focused counterparts, though. That means they can be noisy, shift around underfoot and generally feel a bit flimsy during faster and longer runs. On top of this, those without handles don’t have the automatic shut-off functionality either, which can make them more dangerous, particularly when using them at higher speeds.In summary,running treadmillsare better suited to those wanting to move at higher speeds. They feature more underfoot cushioning or built-in suspension systems, which make longer, faster sessions more comfortable and easier on the joints.What are the weight capacities of walking pads?The weight capacity, often expressed as max user weight, of a walking pad varies, with the larger, more expensive units typically able to shoulder more weight. We found that most walking pads average about a 90kg maximum weight capacity, but this figure can increase to about 120kg in some models, such as the Urevo Strol 2E. It is best to check the manufacturer specification before buying.What safety features do walking pads use?As with most modern treadmills, many walking pads feature a magnetic safety key that attaches to the unit, while the other end is clipped to the user’s clothing. If the magnetic key is removed due to a fall or exiting the walking pad, the unit will automatically shut off. In addition, many walking pads will use a non-slip belt for improved traction underfoot, and some will even use a folding handrail that can be erected when using the walking pad at higher speeds, such as during jogging workouts or faster walks.Walking pads vs treadmillsThe clue is in the name here, as the smaller and generally more portable walking pad is predominantly designed for walking, or very light jogging at most. The decks and general build aren’t robust enough for running or faster sprint work. As a result, the max speed is typically limited to around 6-10km/h, rather than the 20km/h achievable on some domestic treadmills. Walking pads will also have fewer features, lacking things like built-in programs, incline/decline and modern touchscreens for on-demand classes.For more:The best exercise bikes – testedThe best running watches to hit your fitness goalsThe best cross trainersLeon Poultney has been traversing the worlds of consumer technology and automotive for some of the biggest lifestyle websites and magazines for longer than he cares to divulge.

On a road trip tracing Poland’s best terroirs back in the summer of 2023, I met winemakers going against the grain, unshackled by tradition and producing unpretentious, expressive pours that more than merit a place on your dining table.Lately, Polish wines have been cropping up all over bar and restaurant lists: Niemczańska’s chardonnay at London’s most emblematic Polish restaurant, the borscht-frontedDaquisein South Kensington, say, while chic barSpryin Edinburgh has started stocking my favourite producers, Dom Bliskowice, Kamil Barczentewicz and Nizio.But you won’t find bottles nestling between the neat rows ofkabanossausages of your localPolski sklep, nor lining the supermarket shelves. Or not just yet, anyway.Among my parents’ generation, the term “Polish wine” is marred by sickly-sweet memories of moonshined fruit concoctions, but the country’s grape-growing heyday was some 500 years ago, courtesy of Cistercian monks. An unfortunate succession of icy temperatures, wars a-plenty and communism dealt its vines a hammer blow, but, in typical Polish fashion, something beautiful blossomed out of all that hardship. A loosening of laws in 2008 catalysed the country’s contemporary wine revival. I spent a stint living in Warsaw a decade ago, when the city bristled with cool, creative cuisine, but back then it wasn’t easy to find homegrown wine on a menu. But no longer: more than 600winnice(wineries) have sprung up across all 16voivode(regions), with the heaviest smattering along Poland’s southeast and southwest fringes.Today, plantings include hardy hybrids such as solaris and hibernal, which can weather the harsh winters, and, increasingly, in our warming climate, classicvitis viniferavarieties such as riesling and pinot noir, though tiny outputs make it tricky (and pricey) to get hold of over here.I loved Ultra, an earthy, herbaceous skin-contact johanniter made by Maciej Sondij of Dom Bliskowice, an architect turned Burgundy importer and restaurateur, on the ammonite-studded inclines two-and-a-half hours’ drive south of Warsaw. At Winnica Silesian, a former communist collective on granite-laden soil 30 miles outside Wrocław, Esben Madsen (a Danish oceanographer who married into the founding Mazurek family) produces playful pours, including a beaujolais-like red made from rondo, dubbedRondo Vous.Much arrives through the UK’s sole Polish wine importer, Adam Michocki, a Leeds-based sommelier who set upCentral Winesafter being wowed by an “absolutely spectacular” bottle from Silesia in 2021. He works with small, family-run wineries, supplying a host of Michelin-starred restaurants and chefs (think Sat Bains, Gordon Ramsay, Heston Blumenthal) as well as independent wine shops across the country, to sell-out reception. “The fresh, crisp nature of Polish wines really fits the current trend for the palate of UK customers,” he says. Cheers –na zdrowie– to that.Four Polish bottles that are worth a tasteNiemczańska 2020 Chardonnay£24.90 Central Wines, 12.8%. Like a polished white burgundy via Lower Silesia.

With two half-Frenchies in the room, we always start withbuckwheat galettes, usually servedcomplètewith gruyère, ham and a fried egg (though the more we eat, the more adventurous the combinations become). Then we move on to softer, thickerBritish sweet pancakeswith lemon juice and crunchy demerara sugar to finish.

Oh, and there’s Meera Sodha’sIndonesian-style salted peanut and chocolate pancakes, while Claire Ptak’s fluffycardamom pancakes with thyme-spiked figscertainly aren’t just for Christmas.View image in fullscreenAuthentically French … Helen Goh’s Breton butter cake with marmalade.Photograph: Rita Platts/The GuardianBut back to my point, which is that crisp, earthy galettes aren’t the only delicious thing to come out of Brittany (they’re not even exclusively Breton: buckwheat pancakes are also commonly eaten in other places that are similarly too wet for growing wheat). Helen Goh’sbutter cake, for instance, is emphatically Breton in its celebration of the rich, yellow stuff produced in this wonderfully wild region that’s one of my very favourite parts of France. Another Breton speciality that will warm you from the inside isa rich, sticky kouign amman, orRichard Bertinet’s prune-studded far Breton, a recipe he inherited from his mother, though he had to go back to the Côte Sauvage to fetch her spoon so he could perfect the dish at home. Come to think of it, that last is a bit like a pancake, so perhaps you could serve it for pudding next week, though obviously you’ll want to have the lemon kind, too.As well as superlative seafood,butter biscuitsandwhat might well be the world’s best crisps(the brand Brets even make a Breton butter flavour variety), we have Brittany to thank for salted caramel, a flavour combination first popularised by Quiberon chocolatier Henri Le Roux. You canmake your own salted caramels, complete with edible wrappers, with the help of Heston Blumenthal, or throw tradition to the wind with Thomasina Miers’Mexican-inspired version, flavoured with smoky tamarind.It belatedly strikes me that my fondness for this place stems as much from its exports as for its ancient dolmens and beautiful coastline –fleur de sel,tinned fishandcider. And, though it’s from neighbouring Normandy, if you happen to see some Isigny creme fraiche in the supermarket chiller cabinet, all thick and yellow and as different from the sloppy bright white stuff as skimmed milk is from Jersey milk, grab a jar, take it home and stick it on a buckwheat pancake with some tangy Bretonsalted caramel sauce. That’s advice for life, not just for Shrove Tuesday.My week in foodView image in fullscreenMake it at home … Meera Sodha’s miso butter greens pasta.Photograph: Louise Hagger/The GuardianThe best thing I ate |The food atTropea in Harborne, Birmingham, never fails to please (even our own Grace Dent loved it), but on my most recent visit last weekend, they even managed to better their excellent ragu bolognese with a ricotta-stuffed agnolotti sitting plumply atop a lake of vivid green kale and herb sauce that was so good, the vegetarian had to fight for his fair share. Back in London, with a bunch of cavolo nero in hand, I couldn’t resist trying to recreate it – I usedJoshua McFadden’s original recipe, albeit with double the garlic, but Meera Sodha’splant-based versionlooks well worth a try, too.My croissant crusade |Last month, I went to Paris for the day on a mission to try as many top-rated croissants as possible, from hipster slow-fermented ancient grain varieties to pastries with a pretzel shell or a swirl of za’atar through them (you can read about it here), but perhaps the most useful recommendation for anyone arriving by Eurostar isBoulangerie Carton, right opposite the Gare du Nord – £1.40 of crisp, buttery joy within sight of the station. Correspondents inform me the place also does a superlative hot chocolate.The truth about carbonara |Until recently, many culinary historians believed that thespaghetti alla carbonaraso jealously guarded by Roman cooks was created during the second world war with US army rations, to satisfy the American appetite for bacon and eggs. This theory seems to have been dealt a death blow by NRC journalist Janneke Vreugdenhil, who recently discovereda mention of the dish in an August 1939 reportfrom Rome. It’s a revelation that the Italian daily La Republicca described as“a nice sigh of relief for those who have always believed in the Italianness of carbonara”. Sadly, there are no details of how to make an “authentic” version.Snack of the week |I have a serious salty, crunchy snack habit – if I open a bag of nuts, I literally cannot stop – so when I read about the Hodmedod’s range of roasted pulses inJoe Woodhouse’s new book, Weeknight Vegetarian, I immediately went online toorder a selection. Not only are they British grown and roasted, but they’re significantly lower in calories than my usual (and delicious!) mixed nuts, and much higher in both fibre and protein, too.

Some places make a feature of their situation, revealing sections of pots not dissimilar to the cross section of snapped wafer biscuits, while others have smoothed the curves with plaster.A few use the caves as originally intended – that is, as natural warehouses offering steady low temperatures and good humidity. In short: the ideal temperature for storing certain foods and wine. Most recently, Vincenzo Mancini, whose project DOL distributes artisanal products from small agricultural realities in Lazio, has taken over a deep cave behind door 93, reclaiming it as an urban ageing space for cheese and cured meat. I visited a few months ago with the chefs from Trullo in London, to do a cheese tasting – and to eat an unexpectedcacio e pepe.Cacio andformaggio: two words for cheese. The older of the two is cacio, from the Latin wordcaseus, which may well come fromcohaesus(cohesive), describing the transformation of milk into curds. Formaggio came later, from the medieval Latinformaticum (form), which in turn comes from the Greek φόρμος, the name given to the wicker container in which curdled milk was placed in order to drain and shape.Writing in about AD50, the agronomist Columella noted: “The best cheese is the one made with the least possible amount of medicine!” No change there, then. His treatise on agriculture, De Re Rustica, also includes detailed instructions of cheese making, and in particular how fresh sheep’s milk was heated with lamb or kid rennet until it coagulated into clotty curds and watery whey. The curds were drained in baskets, sprinkled with salt and then left in a cool, dark place. At the time, cheese was also the daily consequence of numerous flocks travelling with legions – which brings us to what the food writer Eleonora Baldwin describes asla barretta energetica(the energy bar), received daily by the marching men. That is, a stick of cheese.The name pecorino in relation to cheese came later, from the Latinpecus pecŏris(sheep). Like cacio, pecorino was (and is) a generic term applicable to infinite forms, which historically didn’t need any qualification or geographical identity because theywerethe local cheese (cacio). It is only when products moved beyond where they were made that they needed to be identified, protected, marketed, which is why we havepecorino sardo,pecorino romano, pecorino siciliano, pecorino toscano, pecorino filano, pecorino crotonese… And these are just the ones with official status – there are hundreds more.While pecorino romano is far from the only pecorino in the story of the food of Rome and Lazio, it has since ancient times beenthe cacio. (Also important to note is that following laws created in the late 1800s and the effects of urban growth in the 1950s, more than 95% of pecorino romano has been produced on the cheesemaking island of Sardinia, the rest in Lazio and the Tuscan province of Grosseto.) Focusing on Lazio, Vincenzo works with Deroma dairy in Torrita Tiberina, taking wheels of 12-month pecorino romano, their rinds still the colour of pale straw, and ageing them. It is not just the microclimate of the cave; the bacterial microflora within the walls plays a part in the development of flavour, seeing the creamy, sheepish and sharp (salty) flavour deepening, both mellowing and becoming more opinionated at 24, 36, 48 months and beyond. The rounds themselves also develop carefully controlled mould coats, ranging from mottled clam brown to dark moss green.The next cave along is occupied by a restaurant called Flavio al Velavevodetto, so when the conversation turned to how best to transform pecorino romano (cacio) and black pepper (pepe) into the creamy sauce so fashionable today, Vincenzo went from one cave to another. He returned with a cloth full of just-cookedtonnarelli, into which he tossed many handfuls of grated 36-month pecorino and black pepper, gathered it up, shook, rubbed and served. The performance was interesting because this is likely how shepherds, with their cheese-making apparatus and daily supplies, once made the dish – also how clever innkeepers once got clients to drink more. It was even more interesting because the soft, sandy molecules of cheese clings to the fresh pasta like sand. And it is worth trying: estimate 150g of fresh pasta, 50g of grated pecorino and a heaped teaspoon of freshly smashed pepper per person. Personally I have never enjoyed cacio e pepe more.Cacio e pepe in a cloth (in un panno)Serves2Salt100g pecorino2 heaped tspwhole black peppercorns1 very large napkin or cotton tea-towel300g fresh tonnarelli, or tagliatelleBring a pan of well-salted water to the boil. Grate the cheese on the star side of the grater so it’s soft and sandy – avoid a microplane if possible. Smash the peppercorns with something heavy until coarsely crushed.Prepare the cloth: it must be big enough that you can gather up the ends and form a bag to shake.Cook the pasta according to packet instructions until al dente. Use a spider slice or tongs to lift the pasta on to the cloth, spreading it out a bit so it dries a little. Sprinkle the cheese and pepper over the top, then gather up the ends of the cloth so they form a bag. Shake and rub the fabric so the cheese distributes in an even, sandy way.Open up the cloth and, if are in a field, eat directly from the cloth, otherwise lift it on to plates. Serve with plenty of wine or water.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkCheesePastaVegetarian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

But a new book makes the case for ‘healthy dependency’Elle HuntThu 12 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 12 Feb 2026 06.03 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleMany of us desire deeper relationships. What we don’t always agree on is how close is too close. Dating advice often casts intimacy as a tightrope – pull back too much, or push for more. Either move is read as a red flag. Between discussions of incompatibleattachment styles, the importance ofboundariesand the dangers oflove-bombing, it’s easy to get the impression there’s a correct level of closeness to aim for.In truth, intimacy isn’t one-size-fits-all and comfort levels vary – not just between individuals, but across their relationships.In her new book,The Balancing Act, therapist and relationships expert Nedra Glover Tawwab challenges the most pernicious myths about connection, distinguishes between healthy and unhealthy dependency in a relationship, and shows how we can learn to lean on other people without losing ourselves.You can’t learn to be with others in isolationPeople are often advised to stay single until they are ready for a relationship, or know how to be alone. The trouble is, many important relational skills can only be learned by doing, Tawwab says.“What you like, what you don’t like, how to deal with other people and have disagreements: those things are learned in relationships,” she says. “Unfortunately, when we’re alone, we’re not getting any practice.”It’s great to develop awareness of your behaviour and patterns with other people, such as through therapy; but “if you don’t figure out how to be in relationships, you will be without them”, Tawwab says.That’s not to say you should feel obliged to start dating, or jump into a romance before you feel ready, she adds. All types of relationships and interactions present opportunities to learn about other people and ourselves.“If I learned to manage my trust issues with a co-worker, I can take that to a romantic relationship, or a friendship, or a family relationship.”Those transferable skills are another reason to seek out connection, take social risks and resist the tide toward self-isolation.‘Dependency’ isn’t a dirty wordBeing codependent in relationships is widely understood to be a bad thing. Lately “enmeshment” – a psychological concept describing the blurring of personal boundaries within a relationship – has taken off online as something to watch for, and avoid.But even enmeshment “isn’t all bad”, Tawwab says. “When we start dating someone, we do get into this little enmeshed silo, and it’s great – for a time.”In the longer term, or as a consistent approach, being over-reliant in relationships – having unrealistic expectations of a partner, and feeling entangled with them at the expense of your own identity – is unhealthy, Tawwab says.But widespread resistance to being needy or dependent on a relationship is stoked by a culture that vaunts independence and autonomy, often to a disingenuous degree, she says.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’In truth, no one and nothing exists in isolation, Tawwab points out. “Our clothes, our groceries, everything that comes into our homes – it is all from other people. We’re already dependent.”Being under-reliant – resisting making yourself vulnerable, refusing support and seeking “to do everything on your own” – is just as much a barrier to deep and meaningful connections.“The healthy version of dependency is being able to have a support system, exercise boundaries, and notice when something is becoming codependent and make some adjustments,” Tawwab says.We’re not doomed to repeat our patterns …Choremancing: is this the best way to date – or the death of romance?Read moreThat ability to assess our relationships, how we feel within them and make changes where we need to is key to having healthy relationships – and it’s possible to learn.Often, dating advice can paint people as fundamentally “unavailable”, “avoidant” and otherwise doomed to repeat their historic behaviours. But that doesn’t mean it’s fixed, Tawwab says.“We can use attachment styles as a crutch: ‘This is the way I am.’ In actuality, you can change your attachment style, and it shows up differently based on who the relationship is with.”Understanding that can be a positive step towards changing our instinctual responses in relationships, and feeling safe enough to let people in or allow them space.… but we can’t always trust our instinctsThough attachment styles aren’t consistent or immutable, our past experiences often play a part in how we experience closeness.For example, you might think your partner is overly involved with their family, but only they can judge whether it’s healthy, Tawaab says. “Sometimes it’s just a close-knit family, and because you don’t have one, you see it as a bad thing.”Those differing expectations and comfort levels can be challenging to navigate, especially in the early stages of dating. “If I’m an avoidant, and I’m watching someone show up their relationships in a secure way, it’s going to make me uncomfortable.”But only following our instincts and doing what comes naturally can work against us forming deep connections, and keep us stuck, Tawwab says.Instead of acting on your impulse to press for closeness or pull away, she suggests cultivating curiosity about what prompts it – and perhaps choosing a different response.“If you notice you’re anxious and think, ‘Oh my gosh, it’s happening again,’ ask yourself … How can I show up differently with this person? What things do I say that might spark some of that anxiety?”You may find that your fears are self-perpetuating, or that you’re more responsible for creating that familiar dynamic than you think.As an avoidant, Tawwab says, she used to have a checklist of criteria even for prospective friends: “It was exhausting.” Now that she’s become more comfortable with intimacy, she has become better at recognising her sorts of people.Relationships aren’t one-size-fits-all – or even 50-50This is how we do it: ‘Having sex with other people brought us closer, but also exposed insecurities’Read moreWhat one person finds smothering might feel supportive to someone else, meaning it pays to be aware of what degree of closeness or space suits you, Tawwab says.But being clear about your needs in a relationship does not remove the need for compromise and taking responsibility for getting them met. “People think they can just tell someone, ‘Here are all the things you need to do to be in a relationship with me,’” Tawwab says. “Actually, if we want to be in those relationships, we have to show up a certain way.”Sometimes we can penalise partners for failing to meet all of our needs, or even expectations we haven’t expressed. “We get upset because they can’t be what we need them to be … and it gets us into a lot of trouble in our relationships,” Tawwab says.Even aiming for equality can be too lofty a goal, failing to account for individual styles and differences. In all relationships, not just romantic ones, “there are some things that one person does well, and some things that the other does well”.For example, your partner might be a great listener but useless at texting, while your best friend can be an emotional rock and refuse to speak at your wedding. “It doesn’t mean they’re terrible people,” Tawwab says.Instead of keeping score, or striving for 50-50, seek to accommodate and accept other people as they are, while remaining conscious of your own red lines.Trust how you feel – but don’t shy from frictionUltimately, Tawwab says, the best measure of whether a relationship is healthy is how it makes you feel.That’s not to say that we can’t be blind to warning signs, or our instincts can’t lead us astray. Some connections feel strong because they are familiar, not necessarily in a productive or positive way, she says.If trusted friends or family spot things about your partner or relationship you haven’t noticed, and have concerns about how you’re being treated, “that is something to listen to”, she says.But if you feel safe, respected, and free to express yourself and seek outside support, “I would say that’s a pretty healthy relationship,” Tawwab says. “You honour their boundaries, they honour yours, you can have disagreements and argue, and it’s still safe.”Some feelings of discomfort, and even friction, are just part of being in relationships with other people, and often a marker of growth, Tawwab says.She used to be so rigid about planning her time, she was utterly thrown by a date suggesting they see a movie later that day. “That’s when I realised: I need to work through that.”Now that Tawwab has kids, she’s glad she did, she says. “It was good practice.”The Balancing Act: Creating Healthy Dependency and Connection Without Losing Yourself by Nedra Glover Tawwab is published on 10 February by PiatkusExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, famously likened India to a palimpsest, no layer quite effacing the one that went before. That’s how I think of Indian railway journeys. They inscribe on the mind our fellow travellers, our ways, our thousand languages, our landscapes, our climate.I think of a rail journey I made in 1998 – that brutal summer ofnuclear testing– setting out from Mumbai, in an ordinary three-tier sleeper, for Dehradun, 1,000 miles (1,600km) north. The frazzled train fell off any semblance of a schedule. The voyage grew longer, past 50 hours; hotter, past 50C. I remember the metallic burn on the window grilles; the hot, killing wind that blew through them; the sizzle of water drops splashed on the face when theyhit the uncovered platforms in the heart of the country; the melt of my rubber soles. A fortnight later, having trekked to the mouth of a tributary of the Ganges, completing my expedition from the Arabian Sea to a Himalayan glacier, it was possible to look back on the rail ordeal with affection.View image in fullscreenRahul Bhattacharya with his childrenI wonder, as I write, whether this memory seeped into the heat-addled odyssey made by the runaway protagonist of my novelRailsong. Physically depleted as she is by its end, she is sustained by the benevolence and solidarity of strangers. Alighting in the great city of Bombay, as Mumbai was then called, standing below the gargoyles of the gothic masterpiece then called the Victoria terminus (now the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj terminus), she knows she has emerged on the other side of something.In no other activity, so easily available to all, does India offer itself up as wholly as train travel. Mahatma Gandhi, initially a critic of the railway system (“Railways accentuate the evil nature of man”), came around to accepting this, hitting the rails to understand his country on his return from South Africa. This is why I recommend to the prospective traveller not necessarily the heritage or scenic routes – though by all means sample the quaint narrow- or metre-gauge hill railways, or the gorgeous run down the Konkan coast – but instead using the railways simply as a way of getting from one place to another.During a halt, it is possible to pop out on to the platform and buy top-notch, farm-fresh lychees, custard apples and mangoesIn the process, one learns much about oneself. Consider sleeper travel. Is there a situation more exposing than sharing a compartment with strangers? With luck, you might fall into invigorating company. A few months ago, I made an overnight trip up from Mumbai to Delhi with three large policemen, one nursing an injured toe, another dedicated to his newspaper, the third his phone, each initially taciturn. As the journey unspooled, so did their stories. They were going out to capture someone. If it was anything like their last outing to Delhi, when a slippery accused murderer had them chase him for more than 600 miles across three states, these officers would make it on to the news again. Another time, a painstaking manhunt had taken them to Mangaluru on the south-western coast, where they discovered instead the fellow’s namesake – himself wanted in a decades-old riots case. That led to a medal.View image in fullscreen‘Is there a situation more exposing than sharing a compartment with strangers?’ … A sleeper train at New Delhi station.Photograph: REY Pictures/AlamyFood is also a valuable companion on the rails. No matter that dining cars are gone, that regulations about open flames have restricted platform fare, or that the foil-boxed meals served on premium services trigger thousands of official complaints every year and much casual grousing – eating remains a crucial railway habit. Depending on the season, and your route, it is possible to pop out on to the platform during a halt and buy top-notch, farm-fresh lychees, custard apples, bananas and mangoes in places famed for them.We curve out east from Delhi, the dusty brownscapes gradually getting greener, up past the trim tea gardens in the eastern Himalayan foothillsOn the Mumbai-Pune route in the west, vendors at Karjat align themselves with the carriage doors, bearing metal trays of the town’s famedvadapav– a deep-fried, lightly spiced potato ball, placed inside a soft bun with a mix of dry and wet chutneys (for the cautious, the dry is safer). On the same route, as banker (helper) engines push the rake (coupled carriages) up the Western Ghats, the hill station of Lonavala offers up its famouschikki– an energy-boosting sweet made from nuts and jaggery (unrefined cane sugar) – and the more decadent chocolate walnut fudge. In the southern states of Telangana and Karnataka, you might help yourself, as I did a few years ago, to vividly peppy breakfasts ofograni– a mixture of soft puffed rice and an array of condiments and spices, similar yet so distinct from the crunchy, mustardy puffed-ricejhalmuriof Bengal in the east. And there is always the prospect of packing yourself a tuck and sharing food with any friends you make along the way.Despite the myriad challenges of Indian train travel, the journeys are pleasurable and affordable, not to mention sustainable. For these reasons, my family and I do as much of our travelling as possible by rail. Routinely, we curve out east from Delhi, across the great swathe of the Gangetic plains, the dusty brownscapes gradually getting greener, up past the trim tea gardens in the eastern Himalayan foothills, through the narrow corridor known as the “chicken’s neck” (officially, the Siliguri Corridor), into bamboo-shaded Assam, to my wife’s ancestral home. This run, 24 or 28 hours long, depending on the service, sometimes stretches past 35. Our two young girls don’t mind; it’s flights that make them feel claustrophobic.View image in fullscreenChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj terminus in Mumbai.Photograph: Nikada/Getty ImagesThe causes of these delays are often dramatic, and instructive about Indian life.One time, a station footbridge collapsed under the weight of Kumbh Mela pilgrims – typically, a last-minute change of platforms was involved, causing a stampede – in the town then known as Allahabad (since renamed Prayagraj by a regime intent on scrubbing Islamic fingerprints off Indian history). More than 40 people died, putting into perspective my trivial discomfort of waiting in the chilly hours for the train to pull into Mughalsarai (also renamed, after the right-wing ideologueDeen Dayal Upadhyaya). On another occasion, a derailment sent us on a circuitous gallivant through Bihar and Bengal. Then there was the time our rake first mowed down three cows and then, in the middle of the night, smashed into a stalled Jeep. The occupants got away. Unfortunately, this is not always the case.On the railways, the local and the national are linked together, making the wholeOn a monsoonal Assamese morning in 2012, the train I was on came to a standstill beside a paddy field. This was an inexpensive regional service, fitted with unreserved bench-seating – in Indian Railways parlance, a “passenger” train – and it was halting at the merest hint of a station. But even by the standards of passenger trains, this seemed like an eccentric location. Eventually, I climbed off to investigate. In front of the locomotive sat a mangled autorickshaw. The bodies of three men had been laid alongside the tracks.I don’t mean to deter you from passenger services. In fact, I highly recommend them. In a land as diverse as India, a passenger train is a full-blooded immersion in the local: the dress; the produce the farmers carry; the food vendors serve up; the unknown halts that mail and express trains roar past, which are the centres of their own little worlds. After all, on the railways, as in certain novels, the intimate and the epic, the local and the national, are linked together, making the whole.Rahul Bhattacharya’s latest novel, Railsong, is publishedbyBloomsbury(£18.99).

For this reason, I’ve ended up working in public service and tryto reduce how much meat I eat. I’m vegetarian 60% of the time, which is not perfect, but I believe doing something is better than doing nothing.But recently, I’ve found it too difficult. It turns out I’m intolerant to most sources of veggie protein and gluten, and it’s really affected my health and limited my ability to socialise and exercise. I don’t want to keep feeling ill, but I also feel shame for not being able tokeep it up.Similarly, with my job I am restricted from things like campaigning. I could move to the private sector, but they also have gag clauses and do less good. Quitting all work is not viable or fair to my family, but silence also feels like complicity.My question is: how will I know where the line is? Am I being lazy and complicit because these things are inconvenient to me, or is there a point where it’s OK to compromise?Eleanor says:One of the features of a profoundly unjust society is that engaging with justice can look so onerous. You’ve been trying to eat less meat, work a more meaningful job. That’s something! That’smuchbetter than nothing! Now what about cars, are you driving less? Do you fly? Donate blood? Do you have disposable income? Do you donate to charity? For $5, you could provide a bednet that could prevent malaria in another country. How many times have you spent $5 on something trivial?It all feels so demanding so quickly. We despair of our chances for drawing a principled line that could explain why it’s OK to make justsomeeffort, give awaysomeof what we have. Donate some money – why notmost? Donate blood – why not akidney? Once you start thinking about morality at all, consistency threatens to compel you to change a great deal about your life, so it can feel like the only options are to have your eyes open to the scale of these problems (and so feel doomed to fail) or close them again (and so also fail, but at least not feel bad about it).After high school, a friend I was very close to drifted away. Should I seek closure from her? | Leading questionsRead moreNo wonder so many of us trend towards a kind of nihilism and tell retrofitted stories that justify the closing of the eyes. I’m not going to make a difference anyway. Self-care compels me not to watch all that suffering on the news. It’s an act of revolution to go back to bed.I think there are two good responses to all this overwhelm. One is to really try to do the most good. Make the sacrifices that have the biggest proportionate impact. Find the things that will make as big a difference as possible without making you feel sick, or like you’re being unfair to your family. And, with your particular knowledge and skills – perhaps you’re a good communicator, or you’re good with tools – you can ask: “Where ismymoney, time and effort best spent?”The other is to ask a different question from “am I complicit?” In my view, that already cedes to a certain way of seeing these things. It’s about whetherI’mon the hook. Exactly as you say, complicity of that sort is everywhere: the work we do, the property we live in, the transit we use, the food we eat. Sometimes being “complicit” in one way is how you do the most good in another, as you described with your job. A lot of our cultural thinking about morality focuses on: “Am I doing enough to alleviate the symptoms?”A different question might be: “how much am I helping to resist the causes?”The hazard with eating less meat or driving less as ways of engaging with the massive consumption of animals, or pollution, disease or global poverty, is that they riskindividualising what should be collective. As well as thinking “something is better than nothing”, another place to spend your energy is on thinking about how you can help build the communities that address the causes, too. How could you help build groups in your neighbourhood, your community, your job, your political groups? Are there ways to volunteer, organise or create groups that fight as well as fighting on your own?Guilt asks what you’re failing to do. But another way to see the world is: what are you helping to build?Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleLeading questionsHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The conditions were often brutal – but he found kindness and friendship as he rodeRachel DixonThu 12 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleIn April 2022, Andreas Graf set off on his bike from his home in Norway. His dream was to cycle to India. A week later, having reached Sweden, it was already becoming more of a nightmare. “It was pouring with rain and I was lying in my tent in my half-wet sleeping bag and I was like, I could be in my very cosy Oslo apartment,” he says. “I had this good life, a career, a partner, and I had left everything behind.”He was 31. Friends were settling down. Graf had a well-paid job in industrial engineering, but was still renting in a houseshare. “I had started to think about whether to make a financially reasonable and sensible decision, or do something else. I went for option two.”Opting out of the rat race and going on a big adventure is not unusual in Norway, he says. “I know quite a few people here who took the kids out of school when they were young and went sailing for a year.” He thinks the pandemic unleashed a lot of latent wanderlust: “Coming out of Covid, people had an excitement for going out into the world.”Graf, too, was “hungry for an adventure”. “I wanted to chase some mountains and meet people. And I’ve always felt drawn to self-propelled ways of travel.I wanted to be independent and free,” he says. He considered walking, inspired byThe Longest Walkby George Meegan, who trekked across the Americas in the late 70s.He settled on cycling so he could cover more distance while still travelling slowly.View image in fullscreenWatching the sun set over the Salar de Uyuni saltflats in Bolivia.Photograph: Andreas GrafHe thought it would take about nine months to get to India, but he didn’t obsess over routes and times. “I’ve never been much of planner,” he says. And the world seemed so uncertain – some countries were still closed due to Covid and the Russian invasion of Ukraine had begun two months earlier, “so having a plan set in stone was never really an option”. Anyway, Graf was in no rush. He had savings and would be living cheaply. “I was never out to set a world record. It’s not an ambition I have. I had all the time in the world.”I’ve always felt drawn to self-propelled ways of travel. I wanted to be independent and freeDespite his doubts in Sweden, he cycled on through Denmark, Germany and Poland, then south through central Europe, Greece and Turkey. “The beginning was quite hard. I thought it was loneliness but in retrospect I think it was more of a detachment process,” he says. “We build our identities around jobs and roles we have in the family. You’re slowly stripping yourself of your identity, and at some point you’re like, who actually is Andreas?” After three months of cycling, he says, he was “in a bit more of a peaceful state”.Leaving Europe behind, he cycled across the United Arab Emirates and Iran, flew over Turkmenistan (which was still closed), then biked on through Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Pakistan. By the time he reached his original goal, India, he had no intention of stopping. Somewhere along the way, he had started to dream about cycling around the world, completing a full circumnavigation. (The first person to do this was Thomas Stevens from 1884 to 1886, but it remains a rare feat. The current world record was set by Mark Beaumont in 2017: 18,000 miles (29,000km) in 78 days.)After India and Nepal, where he took a month off and volunteered on a coffee farm, he flew across Myanmar – another closed country – and cycled through south-east Asia to Singapore. He took a ferry to Indonesia and cycled its length, followed by Timor-Leste, Australia and New Zealand. He flew to Chile and biked back and forth between it and Argentina – probably his favourite country – then across Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. After a final flight to Senegal, he headed north, all the way back to Norway. Five continents, 50 countries, 55,000km. He reached home on 23 December 2025, his original nine-month trip having stretched to three years and eight months.View image in fullscreenGraf’s journey took him through the Mekong River Delta during the monsoon season.Photograph: Andreas GrafWhen I speak to him over video, four weeks after his homecoming, he is clean-shaven and smart – a far cry from the bearded adventurerI’d seen on Instagram. “I looked a little bit like Robinson Crusoe,” he agrees. “I’ve now had a haircut and a shave and a good shower.”Graf grew up in the German countryside with his brother, parents and grandparents. When he was four, his mother died. She was 33. On the day he turned 33, Graf was cycling across the Australian outback. “Most people reach the age their parents were when they died quite late in life. It’s quite weird to get to that point at 33, right?” He was flooded with contradictory emotions. “You have this grief and sadness on one side: I lost out on having a life and a relationship with my mother. And on the other side, I was really grateful to live the life I’ve always dreamed of.” He realised he’d had this date in the back of his mind before he started his journey. “You ask yourself: if you had a year or two left to live, how would you want to spend your time? I took this leap of faith because that’s how I wanted to live my life. I want to be outside. I don’t want to sit in front of a screen all day.”The moment was a turning point. “I felt really, really at peace with myself. You can sit in the outback for a whole day lost in your own thoughts. And I think most people would experience this as a sort of purgatory. For me, it was just so blissful. And I didn’t know I had it in me, spiritually speaking, to get there.” The journey was changing him. “Change is a constant companion on the road, right? You don’t even realise it’s there, but it’s changing you dramatically one way or the other.” Now, he says, his priorities have shifted. “I used to be someone who was very career-focused, and I think that part of me has disappeared.”Of course, life in the outback wasn’t all about spiritual epiphanies. There was the small matter of survival. “I don’t know how many people I met in Darwin who told me that I was going to kill myself,” he says. “You’re heading into this massive void – there’s nothing in the Australian interior and you don’t really know if you’re going to make it out the other side. You have to look your fears straight in the eye.”I cycled in 51C. I don’t have the words to describe how awful it is. There’s nowhere to hideIt took him two months to cycle across it, in the middle of summer – there was only one day when the temperature dropped below 40C. He carried up to 38 litres of water, in canisters, bladders and bottles. “It’s brutal. The bike weighed 87kg, significantly heavier than I am. But you drink 10 or 12 litres of water a day, so the first day is the hardest, and then it gets lighter and lighter until you refill everything.”View image in fullscreenFighting against constant headwinds and a sandstorm in the Sahara desert.Photograph: Andreas GrafDespite the difficulties, he was drawn to deserts. He ended up cycling through the Sahara in summer too. “In central Mauritania, it was a personal record: I cycled in 51C. I don’t have the words to describe how awful it is. There’s nowhere to hide.” The worst thing was not the sun, but the wind. “You have sand and dust and everything that comes along with it. That was brutal physically, but mostly mentally, because you have the sound of the wind in your ears, day after day after day. It’s torture.” Plus, as the Western Sahara is not a UN-recognised country, there is no diplomatic support in case of emergency. “If you enter that territory between Morocco and Mauritania, you’re by yourself. Nobody is coming to get you.” It took him a month longer to cross the desert than he had expected.How did he stay positive? “What I always try to do is a bit of a reframing experience. It’s 50C, there’s wind, you’re thirsty, you’re hungry, you haven’t showered in a few days. Instead of saying, ‘This is complete shit, I don’t want to be here, this is too hard,’ I’m saying, ‘You’ve had easier days. You’ve also had worse days. You can do this.’ So you just really have a lot of kindness and self-compassion.”View image in fullscreenEarly winter in the Pamir Mountains, Tajikistan.Photograph: Andreas GrafHe is definitely a glass-half-full kind of person. He tells a story about crossing the Ak-Baital Pass (4,655 metres) in Tajikistan, close to the Afghanistan border. It was late October and a storm was raging. “I set up the tent behind a boulder in the middle of nowhere. It was pitch black, freezing and miserable. The next morning, I woke up and the storm was gone. I opened the tent and there was this crystal-clear blue sky and snow-covered mountains all around and it was so quiet. I think you could hear a needle drop in that valley.”He always tried to camp in isolated spots. Didn’t he worry about wild animals? “In the past, I’ve camped next to elephants and rhinos and giraffes. [He spent seven months hitchhiking through Africa after university.] They don’t care about you. The worst animal I’ve met is called human.” One night in a rural part of India, he was woken at 2am. “There was a bunch of guys in front of the tent with knives and machetes and a big flashlight. They were scared – they don’t get a lot of visitors.” One of the men spoke English, so Graf explained what he was doing there. “And he was like: ‘That’s so cool. Do you want to come for breakfast tomorrow?’”One unexpected aspect of his journey was being “showered in kindness and hospitality and love and friendship” from strangers. People would stop their cars and hand him a cold bottle of water. In southern Australia, one couple gave him the keys to their house. They had seen a picture of him on Facebook. “They sent me a Google Maps link and they were like: ‘We’re going away for the weekend, but enjoy yourself. There’s food in the fridge; just drop the keys in the mailbox.’ I was like: whoa, this is incredible. So in that regard I can say my heart is full.”As well as kindness, he found humour wherever he went: “I had people making jokes about the trip in Iran as much as I had in Peru. I learned – and maybe this can’t be said often enough – that we’re not so different as we think we are, regardless of where in the world you live or what your religion might be or your culture. I think people try to live life with a little grace and a little dignity and care for families and friends and neighbours.”View image in fullscreenTaking on the Peruvian Andes.Photograph: Andreas GrafHe survived a 7.4-magnitude earthquake in the mountains of northern Chile. “It was quite scary for a moment,” he says, with trademark understatement. “It comes out of nowhere and everything is shaking. On the left-hand side was this giant volcano, and I was like, is that thing going to blow up?” Thankfully, no one was badly injured.In Peru, all of his equipment broke – bike, tent, mattress, stove – and he had to wait for spare parts to arrive. Was he glad of the rest? “I went ahead and enjoyed my second favourite poison, which was a few weeks’ hiking.”He had an accident in Colombia and broke his wrist. “I had cycled the length of the Andes, almost 10,000km, and coming down the last mountain I crashed. I came around the corner and there was a pothole and a bit of an oil spill. I just flew over the handlebars.” He cycled to the nearest hospital. “I had split my radius lengthwise into three different parts. I had surgery and ended up with a titanium plate and eight screws in my hand.” He was sanguine about the incident. “I was in a very calm state of mind and I was like: ‘Shit happens. It’s part of the adventure.’”He attributes his calmness partly to living life “very naturally”, with little technology. In Australia and New Zealand, he didn’t even have a phone. “Quite often I got up with the sun and I went to bed with the sun. There’s no Monday to Friday, no nine to five, no weekends. The greatest gift was having no perception of time, just living for the days under the sun.” Once, a woman wished him happy new year in a petrol station; he had no idea it was January.View image in fullscreenTaking a break from the relentless sun in the Australian outback.Photograph: Andreas GrafHe was shocked by the extent of plastic waste and water pollution in Asia and South America. “You get a really amazing understanding of how our pollution circles work,” he says. “A lot of European waste ends up being sold to Asia, and there are no facilities there to take care of the amount of trash, so sooner or later it all ends up in the rivers and in the oceans, and then of course over the next 20 years it’s just all coming back.”The climate crisis was also unavoidable. “In Vietnam in the monsoon season, it is 45C and humidity is at 95%. And I actually don’t know how people live there. They get up super-early in the morning, but then from noon to 5pm you see people lying on the side of the road under a mango tree, sleeping.”Now he dwells on the ethics of one day bringing children into such a world. “If they wanted to take a similar trip, I wonder if that would still be possible in 20, 30 years from now. The temperatures are already very extreme. There are a lot of places that I think will be uninhabitable in the next few decades.”Take the high road: the man who visited every country in the world – without boarding a planeRead moreHe is “at peace with closing this chapter” of his life. For now, he’s staying with friends, writing a book about his journey, doing some public speaking and hoping to stay self-employed. “There are other adventures I want to go on,” he says. Meanwhile, he’s finding it hard to adjust to such luxuries as sleeping in a bed and using a computer. “I haven’t looked into a computer screen in almost four years, so it just feels so wrong. I want to go out and look at a tree! On the weekend, I’m going to take my tent and disappear in the forest for a little while.”Above all, he is happy that he finished the journey as he began: on his own terms. “We all face our hardship and troubles. I’m a very firm believer that you can let the circumstances define you – or you can write your own ending to the story.”Find out more about Andreas Graf’s journey atandreasgraf.coExplore more on these topicsHappinessCyclingMindfulnessHealth & wellbeingFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Monday, Keir Starmer looked as if he was on his last political legs. At lunchtime, the Scottish Labour party leaderAnas Sarwar called for his resignation, but by the evening, the troops had rallied, and the prime minister had survived the worst. At least until theGorton and Denton byelectionlater this month.Now it’s Tuesday afternoon and there’s a hush around 100 Parliament St, home to the government’s culture, media and sport department. It’s hard to know whether this is its natural state (it’s also the headquarters of HMRC), or whether the country’s politicians and civil servants are in a collective state of shock.“It’s been a quiet week!” saysLisa Nandy, the culture secretary, with a big smile. Nandy is surprisingly upbeat considering her government has just had a near-death experience after less than two years in power. She introduces me to Owen, her communications adviser. “Owen is going to sit in, in case I say something really fucking stupid, and I have to apologise to the nation.” Is that likely? “Erm, it’s possible. It has been known.”Actually, I’ve always been soft left. I hate that phrase. It makes me sound like a jellyfishThe Labour MP for Wigan shows me around her huge office. The culture is immediately obvious – a poster of Hamlet, a painting of a ginnel in Burnley and an illuminated text sculpture by the British artist Nathan Coley of George Bernard Shaw’s quote, “You create what you will.” The sport is also obvious: propped on top of a model of Trafalgar Square’s fourth plinth are a football and a rugby ball. The football belongs to Bury FC, whose financial collapse led to the establishment of the Independent Football Regulator, one of Nandy’s proudest achievements at the DCMS.As for the media element of her title, apart from today’s newspapers arranged on a table, it’s otherwise not so visible. Critics have suggested the same could be said of her performance, at a time of BBC crises, online regulation battles and the scandal over sexualised AI images being created using Grok. She certainly seems happier talking about culture and sport.There’s also a lovely framed photo on the wall of Tessa Jowell, who died in 2018. Jowell held the same office and was Nandy’s mentor. “They say here she was the best culture secretary within living memory. I was her PPS [parliamentary private secretary] when I first came into parliament. I was a proper awkward sod on the backbenches.” In what way? “Back then, before all the Corbyn stuff started, I was the hard left of theLabourparty.” There’s a little poetic licence here. “We’d just come out of government and there’d been quite a narrow range of views at the top of the party. And I came in, and I was sort of throwing rocks at them, and Tessa said, ‘Before you decide you hate us all and want to burn this place to the ground, why don’t you come in and work with me, and see how it works?’ And it was magic.” Nandy has never struck me as a political pyromaniac. A moment later, she admits she’s indulging herself. “Actually, I’ve always been soft left. I hate that phrase. It makes me sound like a jellyfish.”View image in fullscreenNandy talks to lecturers on strike at the University of Manchester in 2020.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianPerhaps it was inevitable that Nandy, 46, would end up in parliament. She was raised in a political, high-achieving family and realised you could make the world a better place through politics (her maternal grandfather was the liberal peer Lord Byers; her father, Dipak Nandy, is an esteemed Marxist academic who helped write the Race Relations Act; her mother, Luise Fitzwalter, wasone of the first female TV producers at Granada). Today, Nandy lives in Wigan with her partner, Andy Collis, a public relations consultant, and their 10-year-old son.As a mixed-race girl she was shaped, growing up, by the racism her family faced; as a daughter of divorced parents she understood the prejudice against single parents; and as a pupil at a comprehensive school she saw how limited opportunities were for children less privileged than her. After studying politics at Newcastle University, she worked for Centrepoint, the charity that supports homeless young people, before moving to the Children’s Society. She has represented Wigan since 2010, when she was selected to run from an all-women shortlist. Labour had just lost power, and she had to wait another 15 years before she could put her principles into practice.The Labour party is famous for its ability to self-destruct. But its brief time in government has been something else – U-turns, financial scandals, resignations, broken tax promises, attempts to strip benefits from disabled people and pensioners, accusations of trying to out-Reform Reform, all topped off with the Peter Mandelson scandal. It was always clear Starmer was politically inexperienced, but not that he was so leaden-footed. When Starmer appointed Mandelson as US ambassador,he knew Mandelson had continued his friendship with the sex offender Jeffrey Epsteinafter Epstein’s conviction – and also, of course, that he had been forced to resign twice before from Labour governments. Now it has emerged that Mandelson, who is beinginvestigated by the police, may have been passing confidential government business information to Epstein.Despite the promise of change, the Labour government looks little different from recent chaotic and deceitful Tory governments. It’s a shitshow, isn’t it, I say. “You call it a shitshow, I say it’s unforgivable,” says Nandy. She pauses. “I want to get the words right because it’s really important. It does look to people outside that we’re more interested in ourselves and less interested in preventing chaos. What was laid bare in the Epstein files is that there are a group of people in this country and across the world – powerful, wealthy people, mostly men – who control the system, look after their own interests, look after each other and screw everyone else. And that has been happening in plain sight for a really long time. Look across this country at so many things, whether it’s the taxation system, or housing or water or energy, the opportunities people have, the voice that people have, and people say the system is rigged for a reason. Because it is. It works against the interests of most people in most parts of the country.”In the end, she says, it’s all about power – the unfair distribution of it, and the abuse of it. On a good day, Labour will talk about the redistribution of wealth. But, she says, it has to go deeper than that. “At times in our history in the Labour movement we’ve understood that our job is not just about redistributing wealth, it’s about who holds power.” And now? “I think we’ve forgotten it.”View image in fullscreenNandy on stage at the Labour Party conference in Brighton, 2021.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAHow have things become so bad so quickly? “We’ve not done enough, and this has got to be the moment of reckoning where we say not just what are we here for, but who are we here for?” Whoisshe here for? Nandy points out of the window. “The ones who aren’t in here, the ones who didn’t make it, can’t make it. We talk about people who feel left behind. They don’tfeelleft behind – they have been routinely disregarded and disrespected. And we’ve got to change that.”But hasn’t Labour itself left these people behind? The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said this is “not the party for people on benefits”. Nandy thinks Reeves was clumsy with her language and what she meant was that Labour is notjusta party for people on benefits. But she doesn’t seem wholly convinced. “People haven’t just felt disrespected; they have been disrespected. Not just in the things that people go out and say that are crass, but look at the arts and culture funding we spend on our great national institutions – virtually all of them are in London. So that means we’re effectively saying to the whole country, bar one small part, you have no art and culture, you have nothing to contribute. Which is why one of the first things I did when we got into government was say: that’s got to change. So arts funding has had the biggest uplift in a decade, and it’s going straight into communities all over the country, not just the major cities.”She says a government needs hope and vision to succeed. I tell her I agree, but I don’t think Labour offers either at the moment. The government seems angry rather than hopeful – angry at Peter Mandelson, angry at asylum seekers arriving on small boats, angry at Labour voters defecting to Reform, angry at the way the country has changed. What did she think ofStarmer’s island of strangers speech? “I found it jarring because my dad used to debate with Enoch Powell on TV shows. What I think [Starmer] was trying to say is something I would express very differently. In this country, one of the biggest challenges we face is that we’ve lost the ability to understand one another.”View image in fullscreenNandy … ‘I’ve always hated populism.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian; Assistant, Ryan PrinceIf she were going to revamp Starmer to make him more appealing to the electorate, where would she start? She looks at me, aghast.“You know he is an actual person? You can’t revamp a person.”OK, I say, customise him.Her eyes widen even more. “Are you saying customise? Flipping heck, Simon, if I went to Keir and told him ‘I’m going to customise and revamp you,’ he’d tell me to fuck off.”Seriously, I say, how does he or Labour have to change to win back the people who voted them in?Two things, she says. “Every day we have to get up and say: how do we rebalance this country in favour of ordinary people? How do we break up this network of people who’ve had a grip on our systems, institutions and opportunities for too long? We’ve got to be prepared to think big enough to change things, not just tinker around the edges.”Public faith in politics is now in the gutter. Here’s how Labour should drag it out | Polly ToynbeeRead moreSecond, she says, Labour politicians must be better role models. “We’ve got to behave like the country we want to see. We want a country where people listen to one another, understand one another. We want a country where women are treated properly, with real respect and power. We want a country that has the intellectual curiosity to seek to understand people who come from different walks of life.”But, she says, British democracy has never faced a greater threat. “We all get out of bed every morning determined to try to turn things around in this country. And we are staring down the barrel of a fascist government for the first time in British history. We are heavily aware of the responsibility on us all to sort this out, and you saw it playing out in real time yesterday with the cabinet all rallying round and making sure we didn’t do something utterly stupid for the country.”How are they going to win back lifelong Labour voters like me who have lost the faith? “I’ll give you my starter for 10. If you look across the political landscape, do you really believe there’s a group of people who will genuinely be capable of making the fundamental change the country needs?” But it’s not good enough to tell me that all the other options are worse. That’s taking voters for granted.I tell her I’m sick of getting messages telling me that if we don’t vote Labour we’ll get a Reform government. “Well, I would say get off social media.” It isn’t coming from social media – it’s coming from Labour party emails. She laughs. “Oh! I just get the ones asking for money.” Thesearethe ones asking for money, I say.If she was 18 today, who does she think she’d vote for? “Labour,” she says instantly. I say I don’t think she would, because Labour doesn’t offer young people the hope she says is vital. I bet you’d vote Green, I say. She looks appalled. “No, I wouldn’t. Not in a million years. Hand on heart. I’ve been very open with you about what needs to change. But I’ve always hated populism. It stokes people’s anger and gives it nowhere to go.”Five minutes left, Owen says.So what’s the answer?View image in fullscreenNandy (centre) touring What More UK, a business manufacturing products from recycled plastic, with Keir Starmer in 2022.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesOK, says Nandy, here are examples of redistributing power. She cites an initiative from the DCMS: the youth hubs it has set up where young people make all the decisions. “We’re building youth clubs, investing in youth workers and a generation of young people. It’s not going to be us who say what you need, it’s not going to be a group of older men in the town hall either – the stipulation of the funding is that it has to be young people driving it. We’re putting people back in charge of their own lives and their own destiny.” See, she says, that’s putting power in people’s hands.OK, three minutes, Owen says.“I’m just trying to give my pitch to the nation!” she shouts. Nandy says the party has got to stop obsessing about individuals and remember politics is a team game. “We’re the most guilty of it in the Labour party. Since I came in 16 years ago, I don’t remember a single week going by without some discussion of the individuals who are going to ride in and save us. That’s not how politics works. It takes teams, it takes a movement.”She talks about the time her father spent with leaders of the civil rights movement, and what he learned from them. “I remember him saying there were 14 people in the room when ‘I have a dream’ was written and Martin Luther King was not one of them. It takes a movement to create change, and I think we’ve forgotten that. I said as much to the prime minister this week. It’s not just incumbent on him, it’s all of us.”As for the party itself, it’s got to be broader and more tolerant, she says. “We’ve got to step up and sort this out. In terms of how the culture has got to change, we’ve got to be more open and porous and respectful of different points of view.” And, she says, the plotting has got to stop. “Quite a few of us in the cabinet have read that we’re on manoeuvres. I’ve not read anything about me recently, but there has been lots about others.” In 2020 she stood for the leadership and finished third when Starmer romped home with 56% of the vote. Is she really not on manoeuvres now? “No!God no!” So why did she do the interview today? “I think there are things the country needs to hear from us; they need to understand that we see and we acknowledge our mistakes.”View image in fullscreenNandy … ‘I’ve been criticised for not being a cellist.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian; Assistant, Ryan PrinceWhat about her own mistakes? Such as, she asks. Critics say she has been invisible in her media brief, and I tell her I can quote from a satirical column by the parliamentary sketch writer Robert Hutton. You might not like it, I say.“Oh, it’s fine.”So I read on. “I am launching a campaign to bring back the Department of Culture … The question of who should lead this revived government department is of course up to the prime minister. Some would point to Lisa Nandy, currently minister without any discernible portfolio, though there’s no evidence that she would be interested.”“What does itmean?”That you haven’t done much, I suggest.“Why, just out of interest? Is it because he doesn’t agree with what we’re doing? I’ve had criticisms about not telling the media what they can and can’t write, and what they can and can’t do. If you look at some of my social media feeds, it’s why haven’t I shut down GB News or why haven’t I shut down the BBC? I’ve been criticised for being too visible when it comes to the BBC.”Does it bother you? “I’m not interested. Since I got appointed to this role I have been routinely briefed against. I’ve been criticised for spending too little time in London and too much time in other parts of the country. I’ve been criticised for being too outspoken for some of the things that have happened in the media and too invisible about the media. I’ve been criticised for not being a cellist, and for coming from Wigan. I kid you not!” For not being a cellist? “Let me just finish this, because I think it’s really important. I’m not here for those people. I’m here for the young people for whom we’re rebuilding opportunities and trust and the chance to live those richer, larger lives in every part of the country. I’m here for everybody in this country who’s made the most astonishing contribution to our national story and isn’t seen, heard or valued. I’m here for the football fans who’ve watched the thing they most care about taken from them because we’ve allowed a group of people with wealth and power to destroy the things that really matter. I wake up every day and fight for them, and I don’t give astuffwhat people like Rob Hutton think. There you go. There’s your headline.”Ten minutes have passed since Owen counted us down to 30 seconds. Nandy’s got an appointment with the deputy prime minister, David Lammy. “Can I be late for David?” she asks Owen. She says she agrees that the government has got to work on its message of hope, and suggests that Labour hasn’t really got used to being in power yet. “One of the challenges is going from opposition, where all you can do is rail against the system, to government.”Does she think the government will survive? “Yes! You saw it yesterday. We all stepped up, and you can also feel that across the parliamentary Labour party. They want us to succeed, but they want us to be bigger and bolder. One thing I really do think is we came into office with so much that is broken, including people’s faith in politics to make things better. There was so much to fix. The challenge is that I think we’ve started to behave like a government of national emergency and not a Labour government. We’ve got to wear our colours on our sleeves again, because people need to know why we, in particular, are the answer to their problems.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

About 25 other people were injuredand two of themremain in critical but stable condition.The suspect’s mother and step-brother were also found dead at the family home, while the suspected shooter was found at the school with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the authorities said. Policelater identifiedthe suspect as Jesse Van Rootselaar, 18.The office of the country’s prime minister, Mark Carney, said he would visit the small town of Tumbler Ridge, home to about 2,400 people, on Friday.View image in fullscreenThe people of Tumbler Ridge have been left in shock by the violent attack.Photograph: Paige Taylor White/AFP/Getty ImagesPolice said the motive for the attack remained unclear and that the investigation was still in its infancy. The family was known to authorities, Dwayne McDonald, a deputy commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), told reporters on Wednesday.“Police had attended that residence on multiple occasions over the past several years dealing with concerns of mental health with respect to our suspect,” McDonald said. On different occasions the suspect had been apprehended under the country’s mental health act for assessment and follow-up, he added.McDonald also said that at least one of the interactions with police related to weapons. “Police have attended that residence in the past, approximately a couple of years ago, where firearms were seized under the criminal code,” he said. “At a later point in time, the lawful owner of those firearms petitioned for those firearms to be returned and they were.”The suspect had a firearms licence that had expired in 2024 and did not have any firearms registered in her name, he said.View image in fullscreenInvestigators attend Ridge secondary school, where the shooting took place, on Wednesday.Photograph: Eagle Vision Agency/AFP/Getty ImagesWith people across Canada horrified by the attack, questions were raised as to why firearms had been returned to a home where police had been called to attend to mental health concerns.“I have a lot of questions,” the premier of British Columbia, David Eby, told reporters on Wednesday. “I know the people of Tumbler Ridge have a lot of questions.”The former RCMP officer Sherry Benson-Podolchuktold the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation(CBC) that for police to have proceeded differently, Canada would need to change its laws to allow officers to seize firearms if they spot them while carrying out a mental health check.While Canada has relatively high levels of gun ownership, it has much stricter laws than the US, including aban on assault-style firearmsanda freeze on the sale of handguns.The victims included Abel Mwansa Jr, according tolocal media reports. “I can’t handle this pain,” his mother, Bwalya Chisanga, wrote on Facebook. “In the morning my son went to school around 8:20am. The last word he said to me was, ‘Tell dad to come and pick (me up) at church when he comes back from work’.”His father, Abel Mwansa, described him as a child with a scientific mind and bright future, who loved carrying out experiments. “If I had power to give life, I would have brought you back to life together with others that were killed alongside you,” he wrote on Facebook. “But, son, my power is limited, and seeing your child murdered at this age is heartbreaking.”The family of Kylie Smith, 12, also said she had been killed in Tuesday’s shooting. She was the “light of her family,” her dad, Lance Younge,told CTV News. “She was just a beautiful soul. She loved art and anime. She wanted to go to school in Toronto and we just loved her so much. She was thriving in high school. She never hurt a soul.”He urged people to keep the focus on the victims, many of whom had lost their lives before they were teenagers. “You want to put someone’s picture up on the news?” he said. “Put my daughter’s picture up.”1:12British Columbia school shooting 'one of the worst' in Canada's history, officials say – videoThose killed on Tuesday included two people in a home residence that police said was linked to the suspect. Police later identified the two people as Van Rootselaar’s mother, 39, and 11-year-old step-brother. The CBC identified Van Rootselaar’s mother as Jennifer Strang.Social media posts suggested a close-knit family where birthdays were celebrated and the children’s interests were championed. In 2021, Van Rootselaar’s mother linked to the suspect’s now-deleted YouTube channel, saying the posts were about “hunting, self reliance, guns and stuff”.‘No words that capture the horror’: small Canada town shattered by mass school shootingRead moreCourt documents from 2015 obtainedby the CBCsaid Strang and her children had “led an almost nomadic life”, moving across Canada multiple times in the last five years.Speaking on Wednesday, police said they had “identified the suspect as they chose to be identified” in public and on social media. “I can say that Jesse was born as a biological male who, approximately six years ago, began to transition to female and identified as female, both socially and publicly,” said McDonald.After an independent provincial legislator in British Columbia claimed, without evidence, that the shooting rampage was related to the suspect’s gender identity, campaigners and gun violence expertswarned againstgeneralising an entire demographic based on the actions of one person.In the US, the Gun Violence Archive has said less than 0.1% of mass shootings between 2013 and 2025 were carried out by transgender people.Instead, research suggests that transgender peopleare more than four timesmore likely to be the victims of crimes, including sexual and aggravated assault, than cisgender people.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The Papaloapan carried just over 277 tons of powdered milk, according to the Mexican government.Mexico’s determination to aid Cuba in its moment of dire need – even as it bows to Washington’s pressure to stop sending oil – evinces the complex historical relationship between the three countries that stretches back more than a century.“The energy pressure that Trump is exerting onCubaplaces Mexico in a dilemma that is very characteristic of its entire history of diplomatic relations with the United States and Cuba,” said Rafael Rojas, a Cuban historian at the College of Mexico. “Mexico is yielding to the demands of the United States – and on the other hand it maintains its solidarity with the island.”Mexico’s relationship with Cuba stretches back as far as the 19th century, when revolutions for independence from Spain in both countries saw waves of migration between the two countries, Rojas said.Migration from Cuba to Mexico increased again during the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, which stretched from 1952 to 1959. Among those who moved to Mexico were Fidel and Raúl Castro as well as an Argentinian exile named Ernesto “Che” Guevara.View image in fullscreenFidel Castro, left, and Ernesto ‘Che’ Guevara in Miguel Schultz jail in Mexico City in June-July 1956.Photograph: ApicGuevara met the Castro brothers in Mexico City in 1955: together, they began planning what became the Cuban revolution, which toppled Batista in 1959. Afterwards, Mexico was one of the few countries in the region that did not yield to US pressure and maintained ties to the island.“The relationship with Cuba has historically served the Mexican government to distance itself from the United States,” said Rojas.And even though there was a tacit agreement that Cuba would never actively support guerrilla movements in Mexico, the Cuban revolution inspired Mexican leftists to protest andeven to take up arms against the country’s one-party state.“In Mexico, there was a feeling of a certain fraternity and solidarity, even with the Revolution,” said Ricardo Pascoe, a former Mexican ambassador to Cuba. “People saw it as a good option in the debate on how to combat poverty in Latin America.”During the cold war, Mexico became a safe jumping-off point for Cubans wanting to travel to other countries, including its revolutionary leaders.Still, despite publicly maintaining its solidarity with Cuba, the Mexican government was keenly aware that it could not sever ties with its powerful northern neighbour, and even shared intelligence with the United States on Cubans who were coming in and out of the country.Throughout the following decades, including after the fall of communism, Mexico maintained this contradictory relationship in which it kept up strong ties to the island through trade and humanitarian aid – even as its relationship to the United States became increasingly important.That changed in 2018 with the election of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, popularly known as Amlo, who, along with his leftwing Morena party, was much more aligned with the Cuban government, voicing public support for the island and condemning the US trade embargo.“When Morena comes to power, there is not only fraternity and solidarity, but also an ideological identification,” said Pascoe.Cuba on the brink as Trump turns up the pressure: ‘There is going to be a real blockade’Read moreThat has placed Sheinbaum in a particularly precarious position between wanting to appease the pro-Cuban base of her party, while at the same time needing to maintain a good relationship with the Trump administration, particularly with the upcoming renegotiation of the US-Mexico-Canada agreement.Even after Mexico stopped oil deliveries to Havana, Sheinbaum was at pains tocast it as a “sovereign” decision.“There’s a discursive balance whereby … she’s presenting this policy of solidarity to appease her base, and on the other hand, she can’t hide the transaction with the United States,” said Rojas. “The fact thatMexico, under pressure from Donald Trump, has stopped sending fuel to Cubameans that Mexico has complied with the oil embargo imposed by the United States.”With Cuba’s energy crisis deepening, and life on the island becoming increasingly desperate, Sheinbaum has offered Mexico as a host for negotiations, and on Thursday said that her government was in dialogue with the US so that Cuba “can receive oil”.But if the regime crumbles, Sheinbaum will have to change her tune.“That pro-Cuba rhetoric won’t work for her any more if the regime falls – she’ll have to modify her message,” said Pascoe. “But for now, she’s at a crossroads, talking about sending food, medicine or humanitarian aid, but there’s no more oil.”Explore more on these topicsCubaMexicoAmericasClaudia SheinbaumUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Venezuela! What do we want? Freedom!” they shouted.“I refuse to live in a country without freedom of expression,” said Angel Gutiérrez, a literature student who was one of hundreds to attend the peaceful march – a public show of dissent unthinkable just a few weeks ago, beforeUS special forces seized Venezuela’s 63-year-old dictator.As the crowd grew, 27-year-old Gutiérrez complained that throughout his entire adult life the will of the people had been ignored. “I’m here because I refuse to continue to accept my country carrying on under these conditions … A young person without hope is dead,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe student-led demonstrations in Caracas were publicised on a national television network.Photograph: Maxwell Briceno/ReutersIn another hint of a possible thaw, the protest was publicised by Venezuelan television networks including Venevisión, which for years have been forbidden from covering such events. Rallies were also held in cities including Barquisimeto, Ciudad Guayana, Maracaibo and Mérida.“It’s incredible that we are back in the streets. They should know that they will never silence us,” said John Pérez, an international relations student, who joined the march in Venezuela’s capital.The student-led demonstrations were the latest – and largest – of a series to take place since US troops abducted Maduro on 3 January and partially transformed Venezuela’s authoritarian political landscape.While much of Maduro’s regime remains in place, led by his vice-presidentDelcy Rodríguez, the country’s new leaders have been forced to make a series of important concessions, including freeing more than 430 political prisoners, proposing an amnesty, tolerating a growing number of protests and rewriting energy laws to allow the greater involvement of foreign oil firms. A small number of foreign journalists were also allowed into the country this week.“It’s a really weird moment because we are not really in a transition to democracy. We don’t have a date for a fair and free election. The same regime is in power,” said Jesús Armas, a prominent opposition leader who was released on Sunday after 14 months behind bars and attended the university protest.“But at the same time, because of the pressure of the United States, we are starting to see things like the freedom of political prisoners and the people are starting to lose [their] fear,”Armassaid,adding: “But of course the regime is the same.”View image in fullscreenThe demonstration coincided with a national holiday that marks a pivotal 1814 battle during Venezuela’s war of independence.Photograph: Miguel Gutiérrez/EPAYerwin Torrealba, a youth leader from the mid-western state of Yaracuy who was released from prison last month, said he had been astonished to attend a recent protest without being molested by the police. “Two months ago, you couldn’t do this,” said Torrealba, 26, an activist for the movement led by theexiled Nobel laureate María Corina Machado.“[Before] you’d post a photo [on social media] and they’d issue an arrest warrant just for doing that,” added Torrealba. Now, he felt things were changing. Many activists who went underground after Maduro was accused of stealing the 2024 presidential election from Machado’s surrogate were coming out of hiding.“This is a big step forwards. People are becoming active in the streets once again,” said Torrealba, voicing confidence that Venezuela was entering a new, less authoritarian era. “It’s still moving a little slowly, but the transition is steadily playing out.”Thursday’s rallies came one day after the US energy secretary, Chris Wright, landed in Caracas promising “a flood of investment” in the economically distressed South American nation.View image in fullscreenChris Wright, left, and Delcy Rodríguez at the Miraflores palace in Caracas.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn more scenes that would have been unimaginable just a few weeks ago given the toxic state of US-Venezuela ties, Trump’s envoy wasserenaded by a group of young Venezuelan musicianswith maracas and harps.Speaking to reporters on the steps of the Miraflores presidential palace, Wright said: “I bring today a message from President Trump: he is passionately committed to absolutely transforming the relationship between the United States and Venezuela, part of a broader agenda to make theAmericasgreat again.”Delcy Rodríguez told her North American guest: “We are sure this first visit will open the door to many more.”Little more than a month earlier, Rodríguez had accused Trump’s administration of using military action to “capture” Venezuela’s natural resources, which include the largest known oil reserves in the world. Venezuela’s acting president struck a more diplomatic note ina rare interview with NBC Newson Thursday, announcing that she was considering accepting an invitation to visit the US. If such a visit materialises it would be the first of its kind since 1999, the year Maduro’s mentor, Hugo Chávez, took power.Observers remain skeptical about the degree to which Rodríguez’s interim administration will be willing to cede control and warn limited signs of democratic reform could easily be reversed.On Sunday, the opposition leader Juan Pablo Guanipa was taken back into detention by armed men just hours after being released from an eight-month stint in prison and later placed under house arrest. Hundreds of political prisoners remain behind bars.Speaking to a pro-Trump television network last weekend, Rodríguez’s brother, the national assembly president, Jorge Rodríguez, ruled out holding fresh elections in the “immediate” future, while the country was being “stabilised”.Many view their concessions to the White House as a ploy to remain in power, by delaying a vote until after the next US presidential election, in 2028.“I think if they’re smart, they’re going to be stringing the Trump administration along until the Trump administration is no longer in office – and then hope that everyone just kind of forgets about things,” said Michael Paarlberg, a former Latin America adviser to Bernie Sanders.“I think Trump has already largely forgotten about Venezuela,” Paarlberg added.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaAmericasNicolás MaduroDelcy RodríguezDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

After her burial, the brown long-haired mixed-breed dog reportedly refused to leave her side at a cemetery in Taboão da Serra, a city of 285,000 inhabitants about 12 miles from the state capital, São Paulo.Relatives are said to have tried several times to take the dog away, but he always returned and was eventually adopted by cemetery staff, who provided him with a kennel and regularly fed, bathed and vaccinated him.Gravedigger Bob gained nationalfamefor accompanying other funeral processions while reportedly carrying a small ball in his mouth, trying to play with visitors – something many saw as a gesture of comfort in moments of grief.In 2021, after leaving the cemetery grounds, the dog was struck by a motorcycle anddied.There was widespread public commotion, and, as there was no legal provision at the time, the Taboão da Serra city council made an exception and allowed it to be buried alongside its former owner.The NGO Patre, which works with stray animals, launched a crowdfunding campaign to install astatuein the cemetery, where it has stood since 2022. “Our tribute and gratitude for your lessons in love and loyalty,” reads the plaque beneath the statue, adding that “in the face of grief, [Bob] taught us to ‘offer little balls’ and attention when others need it most”.One of the authors of the bill, Eduardo Nóbrega, the the conservative state deputy,postedthat “anyone who has lost a pet knows: it’s not just an animal. It’s family.”He said the law provides a “dignified and accessible” alternative to the previous requirement of cremation, whose high costs often led families to dispose of remains improperly.São Paulo is not the first Brazilian state to authorise the burial of pets alongside their owners, which is already in force in Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina. A federal bill has also been pending in the lower house of congress since 2023.In the city of Apucarana, in the state of Paraná, a similar law faced strong opposition in 2024, with city councillors arguing, for example, that it would be “inappropriate” because a cemetery is “sacred ground”, but it was ultimately approved.Explore more on these topicsBrazilDogsAmericasAnimalsPetsnewsShareReuse this content"

He is now a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute, a conservative thinktank based in Upland, California, and specialises in issues such as immigration, multiculturalism and nationalism.He faces a rough ride from Senate Democrats over a long history of inflammatory remarks, some since deleted from social media, many on the topic of race.Carl has repeatedly expressed sympathy for the “great replacement” theory, a baseless notion that immigration is engineered to supplant white populations. “Imagine thinking the Great replacement is a conspiracy theory,” hewrote in September 2021.In 2021, responding to comments by then congresswomanCori Bushabout systemic racism, he wrote: “There is no ‘peaceful coexistence’ we are going to have when our opposition is led by people like this. We either win or die.”In the same year, he lamented what he inaccurately described as the “total absence” of white Protestants in Joe Biden’s administration, calling it “a huge story” that was being ignored. He dismissed the creation ofJuneteenth as a federal holidayas “race hustling and white-shaming” and described “self-hating white people” as “mentally ill”.Following the conviction of members of the far-right Proud Boys for seditious conspiracy, Carl wrote that he would “rather be a Black man on trial for the assault of a white man in 1930s rural Mississippi than I would be a right-winger in DC today on trial for political crimes”. And in the wake of Derek Chauvin’sconviction for the murder of George Floyd, Carl repeatedly described Floyd as a “violent felon” and “thug”, writing that he was “looking up from hell”.The Senate has previously rubber-stamped Trump nominees such asPete Hegsethas defence secretary, Robert Kennedy Jr as health secretary and Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary despite misgivings over their extremism or lack of experience. But Carl may prove a bridge too far.Desirée Cormier Smith, the co-founder and co-president of the Alliance for Diplomacy and Justice, said: “My concern with Mr Carl is that he not only has no multilateral qualifications for the job but, perhaps more important, he has espoused white supremacist, racist, antisemitic and homophobic views. He is a proponent of the great replacement conspiracy theory, which essentially says that Jewish people and people of colour are in cahoots to ‘replace’ white people around the world.”She added: “He has written books about a white genocide and how anti-white racism is going to ruin American democracy. He has called theCivil Rights Act of 1964an ‘anti-white weapon’. This is someone who has extremely dangerous and offensive worldviews and I don’t believe he could credibly represent the United States to the rest of the world.”Trump has rattled global alliances with tariffs, threats to Greenland and the gutting of the United States Agency for International Development. Asurvey by Pew Research last yearfound that positive ratings of the US had dropped significantly in 15 countries since the previous year. One of the biggest declines was in neighbouring Mexico.Smith, formerly the state department’s special representative for racial equity and justice, warned that the confirmation of Carl would only further damage America’s standing. “White people only represent about 7% of the global population,” she noted. “Imagine how he would be able to credibly engage in a respectful manner as partners with diplomats from Africa, from Latin America, from the Caribbean, from Asia, from Europe who are not white?“How could they engage with someone who essentially believes in white supremacy? I don’t think it would be in the best interest of the United States to send someone to engage with the world who has these kinds of racist, offensive views.”Last September,CNN reportedthat Carl had deleted at least 5,000 social media posts, including expressions of sympathy of Trump supporters who attacked the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, whom he described as “political prisoners”. He even sought to have material removed from the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine – though not all of it disappeared.In December,Jewish Insider highlightedmore of Carl’s past comments, including an apparent call for the “Jewish question” to be addressed.Carl faces a committee united in opposition on the Democratic side. With no votes to spare, he will need every Republican on the panel to fall into line if he is to be reported favourably to the Senate floor.Jeanne Shaheen, the committee’s top Democrat,told the Axios news site: “I am going to ask him about his statements with respect to women, and the antisemitic comments.” Senator Tim Kaine was quoted by Axios as saying: “I’m amazed that Republicans have not pulled his nomination. He has such a flagrant series of just horrible missteps, discriminatory, antisemitic comments.”Earlier this week Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader, took to the Senate floorto denounce the nominee. “To call Jeremy Carl a radical and a bigot and unqualified is all far too kind,” he said, accusing him of a “long history of making violent, antisemitic and openly racist comments on podcasts and on social media”.Schumer added: “He said that ‘Jews often love to play the victim.’ And on a podcast a few years ago he added ‘throughout history, Jews chose some professions that made them more oppressive and they can’t be surprised that the average descendants of Cossack peasants would be resentful towards them.’“Can you believe this? What stereotypical garbage. On the Holocaust, Jeremy Carl simply says: “Everyone has traumas in their past.” In other words, get over it. That’s vile.”The state department did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsAmericasForeign policyUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

She travelled with him to Beijing last September for Kim’s first summit with Xi Jinping in six years, on the sidelines of a second world war memorial event.Speculation about her political future intensified last month when she joined her parents on aNew Year’s Day visitto Pyongyang’s Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, a sacred family mausoleum displaying the embalmed bodies of her late grandfather and great-grandfather, the country’s first- and second-generation leaders. Some experts saw the visit as the clearest sign yet that she was being position as heir to her 42-year-old father.South Korean officials initially expressed doubt that she would be chosen as a North Korean leader, citing the country’s deeply conservative culture and tradition of male-dominated leadership. But her increasingly prominent appearances in state media have prompted a reassessment.In its previous assessment of Ju-ae’s status, in September the NIS told lawmakers that Kim’s decision to bring her on his trip to China was probably part of an effort to build a “narrative”, possibly paving the way for her succession.Lee said: “In the past, [the NIS] described Kim Ju-ae as being in the midst of ‘successor training’. What was notable today is that they used the term ‘successor-designate stage’, a shift that’s quite significant.”According to Lee, the agency cited her growing presence at high-profile military events, her inclusion in the family visit to Kumsusan, and signs that Kim was beginning to seek her input on certain policy matters.Not much is known about Kim’s daughter. Despite her increased visibility in propaganda, North Korean state media have never published her name, referring to her as his “respected” or “most beloved” child.The belief that she is named Kim Ju-ae is based on an account by the former NBA star Dennis Rodman in which he recalled holding Kim’s baby daughter during a trip to Pyongyang in 2013. South Korean intelligence officials believe she was born sometime that year.In 2023, South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers that Kim and his wife also probably have an older son and a younger third child, whose gender is unknown.Since North Korea’s foundation in 1948, it has been ruled by male members of the Kim family, beginning with the country’s founder, Kim Il-sung, and followed by his son, Kim Jong-il.Kim Jong-un was just 26 when he was officially named heir during a 2010 party conference, two years after Kim Jong-il had a debilitating stroke. After his father’s death in December 2011,Kim Jong-unwas abruptly thrust into the throne with relatively little preparation.Some analysts suggest Kim’s decision to give his daughter and early debut may reflect his own experience of being rushed into power.Explore more on these topicsNorth KoreaKim Jong-unSouth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The commissioner is ultimately responsible. Those who made the decisions must step down, resign or be removed from their position,” he said on Friday.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailMahmud Hawila, a barrister and former police officer, negotiated with senior officer David El-Badawi during the protest to allow the men to finish their prayer,according to the Sydney Morning Herald.Hawila said police should now release the body-worn video footage from those involved.“Simple demands – 1. Release the footage. 2. Public apology. 3. Independent investigation,” he said in a post on social media.Monday’s protest was organised by pro-Palestine groups to coincide with Herzog’s contentious visit to Australia.The four-day trip was declared a “major event”, unlocking further police powers to search and move on activists across large parts of central Sydney and the eastern suburbs.Officers were seen pushing, punching and pepper spraying people at the protest, including medics, who said they were violently pushed while attempting to treat the injured.Five people were taken to hospital after the rally, while nine people were charged.Explore more on these topicsAustralian police and policingBondi beach terror attackChris MinnsNew South WalesSydneynewsShareReuse this content"

Pauline Hanson’s party is strongly outperforming the Coalition in recent polls.0:55Outgoing opposition leader Sussan Ley speaks after losing the Liberal leadership vote – video“I am not sure what comes next for me,” Ley said.“I look forward to stepping away completely and comprehensively from public life, to spend time with family, to reconnect with my enduring passion, aviation, which taught me, if I had an ego, I’d be dead.”Who is Angus Taylor? Long touted as a Liberal leader, some colleagues see only style and no substanceRead moreVictorian senator and Taylor backer Jane Hume is the party’s new deputy leader, with Ley’s number two, Ted O’Brien, pushing to take a frontbench role after losing the ballot.Hume won 30 votes to O’Brien’s 20. Frontbenchers Dan Tehan and Melissa Price were both eliminated in the early stages of the ballot for deputy.Friday’shotly contested ballotwas the culmination of a months-long campaign from conservative forces inside the Liberal party to undermine Ley, who had been supported by the moderate faction to lead the party after Peter Dutton’s crushing election defeat in May 2025.Ley’s leadership has been undermined by right faction opponents since she took the top job in May last year, and her position has been questioned by critics seeking a stronger conservative stance from the opposition.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailDespite overseeing a partyroom process to dump the Liberals’ commitment to net zero by 2050 – a position agreed in 2021 when Taylor was energy minister, under prime minister Scott Morrison – and taking a position of full-throated support for Israel, Ley’s critics were unhappy she hadn’t been more forceful on migration and cultural issues, or moved more quickly to release policies on cost-of-living.Ley’s leadership was also damaged by two separate splits from the National party, fuelled by bitter disagreements with the minor party’s leader, David Littleproud. After the second split in January, following Nationals breaking from shadow cabinet solidarity over the Coalition’s response to the Labor government’s legislative response to the Bondi terror attacks, Ley’s challengers again started circling.Conservative MP Andrew Hastie had considered running against Ley, but opted not to contest the race over a lack of support.Taylor eventually challenged Leyon Thursday, with the Hume MP emerged as the right faction’s preferred candidate.Minutes after the result was announced, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s office released new online attack ads, dubbing Taylor “just another Liberal.”Fantastic. Great move. Well done Angus: the story of one of Australia’s favourite political memesRead moreTehan praised Ley’s dignified response to the loss on Friday.“But, ultimately, in the end, [she] faced huge, huge challenges, because where we are on the right of politics, we’ve got to unify, and we’ve got to present a cohesive alternative to the government,” he said.“I think we need a serious political manifesto which is true to our values, which clearly articulates where we want to take the nation.”Former Liberal prime minister Tony Abbott told ABC TV the party should immediately unite under Taylor’s leadership.“He’s the best person for the job,” Abbott said.“Everyone should get behind him because we need to win and be a strong opposition.

Long promoted byFrance, “Buy European” could mean imposing requirements on governments to prioritise locally manufactured goods in public contracts.Later this month, the EU executive will publish an Industrial Accelerator Act, which is expected to set targets for European content in a range of strategic products, such as solar panels and electric vehicles.In a show of unity, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Friedrich Merz arrived together at the 16th-century Belgian castle. “We share this sense of urgency that Europe must take action,” Macron said.Merz said: “We want to make thisEuropean Unionfaster, we want to make it better, and above all we want to ensure that we have competitive industry in Europe.”But the two leaders have struck different tones on European preference. Macrontold European newspapers this weekthat European preference should be focused on certain strategic sectors, such as clean technologies, chemicals, steel, automotive and defence, “otherwise Europeans will be swept aside”.He described European preference as “a defensive measure” and essential because “we are facing unfair competitors who no longer respect the rules of the World Trade Organization”.Merz, however, said “Made in Europe” rules may be too narrow and he favoured “Made with Europe” rules that favoured trading partners. He is championing a more aggressive deregulation agenda and trade deals.Ireland’s prime minister, Michéal Martin, said: “We must protect the open free trade ethos of the European Union in my view. And so there will be debates around that.”Merz and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, skirted the issue in a recent joint paper but found common ground on “legislative self-restraint”, or less EU regulation. Both would like the EU’s deregulation agenda to go further.In another sign of the vitality of the Berlin-Rome partnership,Italy, Germany and Belgium co-hosted a pre-summit gathering of 19 member states. The Italian prime minister’s office, the Palazzo Chigi, said the group discussed initiatives needed to “relaunch Europe’s industry”, including a review of the emissions trading system, the EU’s carbon pricing system.The flourishing German-Italian partnership has raised questions about the health of the Franco-German relationship, the traditional motor of the European project. Despite a rapprochement in Franco-German relations since Merz’s election, Paris and Berlin diverge on key economic questions.Merz and Macron also disagree on the EU’slong-sought trade deal with Mercosur. While the German leader has called for speedy entry into force of the agreement with South American countries, Macron dismissed it as “a bad deal”.Von der Leyen has also sounded a cautious note about “Buy European”. Speaking in the European parliament on Wednesday, she said European preference was “a necessary instrument” in strategic sectors. “But I want to be clear – it is a fine line to walk,” she said, adding that every proposal must be “underpinned by robust economic analysis and be in line with our international obligations”.The Buy European question is only one part of a sprawling summit agenda at Alden Biesen in Limburg, an estate founded in the 13th century by Teutonic knights. Leaders discussed deregulation, fragmented capital markets that constrain green and digital investment, and barriers in the European single market that hamper trade.Von der Leyen told MEPs there was “too much gold-plating” – extra layers of national regulation that made life harder for business. As an example, she said a truck in Belgium was allowed to weigh 44 tonnes but could carry only 40 tonnes if it crossed into France.The leaders heard from Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta, two former Italian prime ministers who produced agenda-setting reports on the economy. Draghisaid last weekthat the current economic world order was “dead” and Europe risked becoming “subordinated, divided and deindustrialised at once”.He said Europe needed to move from “confederation to federation”, adding that veto power for individual member states in key policies made countries “vulnerable to being picked off one by one”.Acknowledging the EU’s difficulties in taking decisions, von der Leyen said she was open to moving ahead with passing laws on integrating the EU’s capital markets in a smaller formation, if there was no agreement at 27.“We have to make progress and tear down the barriers that prevent us from being a true global giant,” she said, referencing plans for integrating the European financial system.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropeGlobal economyEconomicsFranceGermanyItalynewsShareReuse this content"

It means making hard choices about force structure, readiness, stockpiles and industrial capacity that reflect the realities of modern conflict rather than peacetime politics,” Colby toldNatoallies on Thursday.Last summer, Nato European membersagreed to increasecore defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2035 to reach US levels, but it is unclear what this increased militarisation will mean in practice.Colby’s comments were made behind closed doors in a short speech to Nato’s 31 other members, at the start of a meeting of alliance defence ministers in Brussels. Unusually, they were released by the Pentagon shortly after delivery.Though he emphasised that the US would continue to provide an “extended nuclear deterrent”, he said Washington’s forces – currently numbering about 85,000 in Europe – would be deployed “in a more limited and focused fashion”.The undersecretary is one of the most vocal proponents in the Trump administration of shifting US military attention away from Europe. The “most consequential” interests for the US were in deterring China and in the Americas, he said, while Europe would have to take “the lead for its conventional defence”.However, Colby also made clear the US “will continue to ready our forces to do our part” under Nato’s article 5, which states that an attack on one ally is considered an attack on all – a pledge that has at times been questioned by Trump.Last month the US president made repeated efforts to force Denmark into handing over Greenland, with the White House at times indicating that it would not rule out using military force to capture the Arctic territory from its Nato ally.Mark Rutte, Nato’s secretary general, sought to move on from the unprecedented row, arguing that an alliance of democracies would always have “debates and discussions”, and he said Colby’s remarks showed that the US was “anchored in Nato”.“The good news is that this alliance always finds a way forward, to come together, to focus again on our overarching goal, which is to keep 1 billion people safe,” Rutte said, arguing that article 5 remained intact.Though the decision to send Colby instead of Hegseth was a clear attempt to demonstrate that Nato had reduced significance for the US, European diplomats insisted he was still an important figure, close to the vice-president, JD Vance.In December, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, skipped a meeting of Nato foreign ministers and sent the deputy secretary Christopher Landau instead. After addressing counterparts in Brussels, Landau left the meeting early.Colby stayed for the entirety of the three-hour meeting on Thursday, listening to the other 31 defence ministers each giving speeches of up to three minutes in length. It was taken as sign of respect to Nato members.Ukraine’s allies committed $35bn in military aid this year following the Nato defence ministers meeting, according to UK defence secretary John Healey. Pledges were made at a meeting of the Ukraine contact group, a group of 50 countries, which came in the afternoon after the Nato session.Explore more on these topicsNatoEuropeUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Some MEPs said the commission’s decision, just before a key EU summit that needed Orbán’s support for aid to Ukraine, was politically motivated.The advocate general’s opinions are not legally binding but are often followed by the court’s judges, who are expected to deliver their final decision in the parliament’s case against the commission in the coming months.Ćapeta said the commission had failed to properly assess the reforms to Hungary’s judicial system and had “incorrectly applied the requirements on Hungary when it permitted, without any explanation, the disbursement of the budget”.The executive had not been transparent in its decision-making, she added, concluding: “The commission may not disburse EU funds to a member state until the required legislative reforms are in force and are effectively being applied.”Billions in additional EU funding remain suspended for Hungary, prompting Orbán, the bloc’s disruptor-in-chief, to regularly accuse the commission of interfering in his country’s internal affairs and using payments as a means of coercion.EU law experts have said that if the court does side with parliament, the commission may have to recoup the money by reducing future funding. The ruling will in any event set an important precedent on the commission’s role in rule-of-law cases.Orbán faces the biggest challenge of his 16 years in power in April from the centre-right challengerPéter Magyarand his Tisza party, who has promised to restore the rule of law and repair relations with the EU.

The group published photos of Sharaa meeting the US president, Donald Trump, as proof that he had turned towards the west and abandoned his Islamist roots.View image in fullscreenTrump shaking hands with Sharaa at the White House in November.Photograph: Sana/AFP/Getty ImagesAccording to the UN report, IS is focused on destabilising the new government in Damascus and is “actively exploiting security vacuums and uncertainty” in the country. It added that Sharaa was the “primary target” of IS in Syria, and that the group was operating through various front groups throughout the country for more flexibility.IS continues to pose a challenge in Iraq and Syria, with analysts saying it has regrouped in recent months, benefiting from a security vacuum and a glut of weaponry that flooded Syria after Assad’s army abandoned its posts. The UN estimates the group has 3,000 fighters across the two countries, the majority of whom are in Syria.Damascus joined the international coalition to defeat IS in November, and recently took over a number of prisons and camps holding suspected IS fighters and their relatives in north-east Syria. Damascusnow controls al-Hawl camp, where almost 25,000 relatives of suspected IS fighters reside, which analysts warn is a “ticking timebomb” for the radical group.IS has carried out several attacks in Syria since the fall of Assad, including an attack on US and Syrian soldiers in mid-December, in which three Americans were killed and three Syrians were wounded.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIslamic StateMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It will take time, but if we establish real accountability in every part of the government and send a message down the chain, that will eventually control corruption.”View image in fullscreenBNP supporters cheer Tarique Rahman at a rally in Pallabi, on 8 February.Photograph: Mohammad Ponir Hossain/ReutersThe elections are the first since the fall of autocratic prime ministerSheikh Hasinain the summer of 2024. The student-led uprising that toppled Hasina after 15 years in power left an estimated 1,400 people dead according to the UN, after it was met with a ruthless and violent crackdown by the state.Last year, the former prime minister –now exiled in India– was found guilty of crimes against humanity committed during the final days of her rule and sentenced to death.For the past three elections, Hasina and her Awami League party have been accused of rigging the results and ruthlessly crushing and jailing opponents, including thousands of BNP activists and leaders.‘Women’s freedoms are at stake’: concern at rise of Islamist party before Bangladesh electionRead moreSince August 2024, Bangladesh has been led by an interim government, headed by Nobel laureateMuhammad Yunus, tasked with restoring democracy and readying the country for free and fair polls. However, the country has remained in turmoil, amid a decline in law and order and frustrations over economic stagnation.Analysts emphasised that a fair and violence-free election would be a vital step forward for the country. There are 127 million registered voters and in a bid to keep security tight, more than 900,000 police, army and security personnel have been deployed on polling day.“This is the first credible election the country’s held in 17 years so it’s incredibly significant,” said Thomas Kean, Crisis Group’s senior consultant on Bangladesh. “People are eager to have the chance to vote after so long.”In Dhaka, young voters spoke of their thrill at experiencing democracy first hand. “I am excited, this is the first time I am freely taking part in an election,” said Yasmin Sorupa, 30, who said she intended to vote BNP. “In the past, I could never cast my vote because when I went to the polling station, somebody had already cast it.”View image in fullscreenBNP supporters walk in support of Tarique Rahman during a campaign rally.Photograph: Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty ImagesRahman returned to Bangladesh to fight the elections on Christmas day, ending more than 17 years spent as a political fugitive. He took over leadership of the BNP from his mother, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, a giant of Bangladeshi politics and longtime political nemesis of Hasina. Shedied just five days after Rahman’s return homein December.“Physically, I may have been out of the country but for all those years I was always connected to my people in Bangladesh,” he said. “As soon as the opportunity came to serve my people, I came back.”Rahman’s time in self-imposed exile in London, living in the suburb of Kingston with his wife and daughter, is said by associates to have mellowed him. His experiences of day-to-day British life also left an imprint, from his push for more tolerance in Bangladeshi politics to his determination to introduce weekly rubbish bin collections in the country.Many in Bangladesh say they cannot forget the corruption that flourished during the last BNP regime between 2001 and 2006, under his mother. Rahman did not dispute that “mistakes” had been made by his party in the past. “I will not deny that. If we do, it will not help anything,” he said.View image in fullscreenBorder Guard Bangladesh personnel stand guard next to a bullet proof bus of BNP chair and election candidate Tarique Rahman, who features alongside his late parents, Khaleda Zia and Ziaur Rahman.Photograph: Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty ImagesThough Rahman did not serve an official role in the previous regime, he was seen as having undue influence and in a leaked 2008 diplomatic cable was described as “a symbol of kleptocratic government”.He was jailed in 2007 as part of an anti-corruption drive by a military-backed caretaker government on charges he denies. In 2008, he was released to seek medical treatment in London, after being so badly tortured in jail that he was taken to the plane in a wheelchair.During Hasina’s subsequent 15-year rule, he was convicted of a slew of terror and corruption charges, which he alleges were politically motivated to keep him out of Bangladesh. In 2024, after Hasina’s fall, the courts overturned his convictions, finally freeing him to return home.“It’s been more than 18 years and they’ve failed to prove anything,” said Rahman. “Don’t you think that’s good enough, long enough to prove that I did nothing wrong?”Yet not all in Bangladesh have cheered Rahman’s return. Both his parents were Bangladeshi prime ministers and to many, he is just the next generation of dynastic politicians, continuing the grip that two families have had over Bangladesh since independence in 1971 and which many had hoped the July uprising would bring to an end.View image in fullscreenJamaat-e-Islami leader Shafiqur Rahman, centre, and other leaders during the last day of an election rally.Photograph: Anupam Nath/APEven if the BNP win a sizeable majority in the election, analysts emphasised that the resurgence of the Islamist Jamaat e-Islami party and their Islamist alliance – parties that were banned under Hasina – could present major challenges for the BNP and Bangladesh’s secularism in the future.Jamaat e-Islami, alongside allies that follow even more hardline Islamist politics, all believe in the introduction of sharia law and are likely to gain the largest vote share in their history and form a formidable opposition.Jamaat e-Islami’s leader has already been accused of regressive policies and controversial views on women’s rights in the home and workplace. Human rights groups have also raised an alarm over a recent surge in moral policing of women, with incidents such as girls being prevented from playing football and enforcement of modest dress and headscarves.Rahman acknowledged there were “some extremist people who are trying to do these things” but he said it didn’t have “any relation with Islam or religion”. Instead, he attributed it to the “absence of democracy … People were not allowed to express themselves for so long, it has built up frustration and in some cases, extremism”.View image in fullscreenTarique Rahman waves from a vehicle after he arrives back in Dhaka from London, in December 2025.Photograph: Fatima Tuj Johora/ReutersHe insisted the rise of radical Islamist politics was not a threat to the plurality of Bangladesh. “If we are able to practise democracy, if we can create jobs for young people and the opportunity to have a decent life, I believe people will come away from this kind of thought.”One of the biggest geopolitical challenges facing the new government of Bangladesh will be rebuilding relations with its neighbourIndia. Under Hasina, India was Bangladesh’s closest ally but ties severely frayed after her government fell and have become outwardly hostile in recent months.Rahman acknowledged that there were “issues” with India and he would only want “a relationship of mutual respect, mutual understanding”.Questioned on whether India and Bangladesh could rebuild a friendship while Delhi continued to give a safe haven to Hasina and hundreds of her party members, Rahman was cagey. “That depends,” he said. “It has to be on them too.”Explore more on these topicsBangladeshSouth and central AsiaIndianewsShareReuse this content"

This effect continued into their early 20s.Higher rates of academic pressure at school were also associated with greater mental ill health, the authors calculated.For every one-point increase in school stress, 24-year-olds were 16% more likely to say they had ever attempted suicide than those who experienced less academic pressure at 15.The senior author Gemma Lewis, a professor of psychiatric epidemiology at UCL, said: “Young people report that academic pressure is one of their biggest sources of stress.“A certain amount of pressure to succeed in school can be motivating, but too much pressure can be overwhelming and may be detrimental to mental health.”The report says that instead of focusing on ways to help pupils cope, schools should adopt whole-school initiatives to reduce exam stress, such as “interventions that enhance social and emotional learning and relaxation skills”.It suggests that reducing the number of high-stakes tests reduces academic stress, while families could “reduce academic pressure and encourage physical activity, socialising and sleep”.The findings underlineresearch by Young Mindslast year that found nearly two-thirds of 15- to 18-year-olds said they struggled to cope in the run-up to GCSE and A-levels. A quarter reported panic attacks, two-fifths said their mental health worsened and one in eight self-harmed or felt suicidal.Paul Noblet, the head of external affairs and research at Young Minds, said: “The evidence could not be clearer: academic pressures harm young people’s mental health.“The focus needs to shift from end-of-year exams and include a mix of assessment methods. How much longer must young people say they are struggling before truly meaningful changes are made?”Instagram CEO dismisses idea of social media addiction in landmark trialRead moreDr Sam Jones, a mental health officer at the Royal College of Paediatrics and ChildHealth, said the findings were symptomatic of wider pressures on children’s wellbeing.“We are seeing a sharp rise in mental health problems among children and young people,” he said. “More younger children are struggling and there has been an increase in self-harm and eating disorders in recent years.“What’s needed to improve young people’s wellbeing is national action to ensure equal, timely and appropriate access to both physical and mental health support, tackling child poverty, improving housing, increasing access to safe green spaces, reducing digital harms and reducing stress at school.”The children’s commissioner, Rachel de Souza, said her research showed that despite valuing their schools and teachers, one-third of children did not enjoy school.“I want to see an ambitious new system of supporting children’s needs in school that rebuilds trust with families, intervenes far earlier, and wraps specialist services and professionals around schools – not waiting for children to reach crisis point before help is available,” she said.A government spokesperson said: “This government is determined to see every child achieve and thrive, which means encouraging pupils to work hard while also helping them manage stress and build resilience.“Mental health support teams are already intervening early with children experiencing mild to moderate issues, and we’re expanding access to a mental health professional in every school, with an additional 900,000 pupils set to benefit this year.“This builds on our support-first approach for children facing barriers to attendance, while our landmark curriculum review will reduce overall exam time and strengthen pupils’ sense of belonging.”In the UK, the charityMindis available on 0300 123 3393 andChildlineon 0800 1111.

There may be some snow showers a little bit further south than that.“We’re not expecting any particularly impactful snow and the conditions will be quite brief before we get another system coming in from the Atlantic over the weekend, but for the next few days it will feel quite a bit different, as we’ve got colder air coming in.”BBC Scotland weather presenter Judith Ralston said: “With a change in weather type, we finally lose the stuck pattern of cloud, rain, and bitingly cold winds.“This finally breaks, allowing a northerly air mass to set in, bringing much drier, brighter conditions, sunshine on the way on Friday and Saturday and a few wintry showers on Friday.”Explore more on these topicsAberdeenScotlandUK weathernewsShareReuse this content"

The British Medical Association (BMA) has said its members could refuse to use parts of the system citing Palantir’s role in targeting ICE raids in the US.Palantir was this week called “ghastly” and “a highly questionable organisation” by MPs in the House of Commons.The fallout over Peter Mandelson’s relationship to the convicted child sexual abuse offender Jeffrey Epstein has also affected the image of Palantir, which employed the former US ambassador’s lobbying company, Global Counsel.Before he was sacked, Mandelson took Starmer to meet Palantir’s chief executive, Alex Karp, at the tech company’s Washington showroom.MPs last week demanded greater transparency around Palantir’s public sector deals, which also include a £240m contract with the Ministry of Defence and with several police forces.In a private briefing forWes Streetingbefore a meeting with Palantir’s European boss, Louis Mosley, in June 2025, Department of Health officials wrote: “The public perception of the [Federated Data Platform (FDP)] during the procurement, and then in delivery, has been affected by the profile of Palantir.“We do not know the extent to which this is impacting on delivery. It is, however, likely to make it harder to go further with the FDP, and to encourage the inclusion of GP data locally.”The briefing was released under the Freedom of Information Act to Foxglove, a tech fairness campaign group.The officials said the rollout had also been affected by debates about patient privacy and concerns that the NHS was being “locked-in” to a single vendor, but added: “Many of these debates are inaccurate and are often as a result of misconceptions.”Donald Campbell, director of advocacy at Foxglove, said: “The prime minister and the health secretary should listen to the public they serve when they tell them Palantir has no place in the NHS.“They should not be scheming with tech billionaires’ staff on how best they can ‘mitigate’ the ‘public perception’ problems these tech giants deservedly face through their own repellent behaviour.”The BMA, which represents NHS doctors, said it has “long opposed the involvement of Palantir in the delivery of care and the use of patient data in our NHS, and it is concerning to see from this briefing that the government felt public concern about Palantir should be dismissed as ‘misconceptions’”.The briefing document suggested Streeting could ask Palantir how to speed up the rollout, and say that the government was keen to “remove unnecessary obstacles” including by revisiting “regulations relating to confidential patient information”.Streeting on Monday sought to show he had “nothing to hide” regarding his relationship with Mandelson by publishing their WhatsApp messages between August 2024 and October 2025.None mentioned Palantir, although in one exchange just over three weeks after Streeting’s meeting with the company, Mandelson encouraged him to visit the US and said: “Need to plan. Lots of tech companies and people to talk to.”New figures released on Thursday showed that the number of NHS organisations using the Palantir technology has increased since June from 118 to 151, which is still well short of the target of 240 by the end of this year.Palantir was co-founded by the Trump supporter and billionaire Peter Thiel, who has previously said “the NHS makes people sick”, and described the British public’s affection for theNHSas a case of “Stockholm syndrome” – the term for hostages who feel a bond with their captors.The former Conservative government minister David Davis said the government now faced a “huge value-for-money issue” over the Palantir contract.He said there had been “naivety in the senior management of the NHS” in awarding a contract to a company with “spectacular baggage in terms of its genesis in the American security state”.“The government is going to have a problem with many hospital trusts and they are going to have really difficult problems with the GPs,” he said. “My best estimate is they will never get most of the GPs with an organisation like Palantir.”John Puntis, co-chair of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign, said: “This looks like another example of a hugely wasteful IT contract, and lack of public trust will make it unworkable.“They ought to end the contract or not renew it. They should accept that the public is very concerned and it is going to make the use of public data very difficult if people think it’s going to be accessed by a company like Palantir.”A spokesperson for Palantir said: “Palantir software is helping to deliver better public services in the UK. That includes delivering 99,000 more NHS operations and reducing hospital discharge delays by 15%, as well as helping the Royal Navy keep ships at sea for longer and the police to tackle domestic violence.”A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “The Federated Data Platform is already delivering for the NHS – helping to join-up patient care, increase hospital productivity, speed up cancer diagnosis and ensure thousands of additional patients can be treated each month.“All providers go through a rigorous, competitive procurement process in line with Government legislation. All data operates under the instruction of the NHS, with strict stipulations in the contract about confidentiality.”NHS England declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthPalantirWes StreetingnewsShareReuse this content"

He was seen with a black, 25-liter Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack.“We hope this updated description will help concentrate the public tips we are receiving,” the bureau said in a statement. The FBI also announced it was increasing the reward in the case to $100,000.Authorities inArizonahave continued to appeal to the public for video footage recorded near Guthrie’s home in the month leading up to her disappearance, while her daughter, Today show host Savannah Guthrie, has pledged to “never give up”.In a poston X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday afternoon, the Pima county sheriff’s department asked for “any video showing vehicles, traffic, pedestrians, or suspicious activity” taken between 1 January and 2 February from an area roughly 2 sq miles in radius from the Guthrie residence in the Catalina Foothills area north of Tucson.The post did not say why the request was made, but followed a flurry of tips – about 4,000 – that came in during the 24 hours since the FBI on Tuesday released door camera video and stillimagesof a masked and gloved suspect outside Guthrie’s home early on 1 February.Despite the surge of information, no new suspects have been identified in the 12-day hunt for the abducted 84-year-old.Savannah Guthriepostedhome video of her family on social media on Thursday, writing: “Our lovely mom. We will never give up on her. Thank you for your prayers and hope.”A man detained at a traffic stop on Tuesday in Rio Rico, about an hour south of the Guthrie residence, wasreleased without chargeafter several hours of questioning.On Wednesday, authorities conducted an “extensive search” of multiple roadways close to the Guthrie home.KVOA, the local NBC-affiliated TV station, reportedthe recovery of a pair of black gloves, which have been submitted for DNA testing, but said it was too soon to know whether they were connected to Guthrie’s disappearance.The Pima county sheriff’s department, which said it was sifting through 4,000 calls received since publication of the images, has not held a media briefing for a week, and said on Wednesday in apost on Xthat none would be held unless there was “a significant development” to report.KVOA said the lack of progress in the investigation was frustrating and causing anxiety for local residents. “We are very worried. The neighbors are all worried, and we do not know who this kidnapper is, what he’s done with Nancy Guthrie. We don’t know what’s going on, so we’re really concerned,” Marla Handler, a neighbor of the missing woman, told the outlet.The station reported that Ring doorbell camera users in Catalina Foothills were asked by investigators for footage from 11 January from 9pm to midnight, and said there was “footage of interest” from the morning of 31 January relating to a suspicious vehicle. Authorities have not confirmed the information.1:46Savannah Guthrie asks for public’s help in finding her missing mother – videoIn a separate development,TMZ reportedthat it received a note early on Wednesday from an anonymous person demanding one bitcoin (about $67,000) from the Guthrie family “if they want the name of the individual involved”. The note has not been formally authenticated, and neither the FBI nor Pima county sheriff has commented on it.Separate purported ransom demands have been received by a number of Tucson-area television stations in recent days, with at least one deadline passing on Monday. Savannah Guthrie, who has presented NBC’s Today show since 2012,posted a videoon social media the same day, asking for prayers and information.“We believe our mom is still out there. We need your help. Law enforcement is working tirelessly, around the clock, trying to bring her home, trying to find her. She was taken and we don’t know where. And we need your help,” she said.Detectives have searched the Guthrie home and surrounding area several times. Signs of forced entry and blood were found on the doorstep, Chris Nanos, the Pima county sheriff, has said previously, prompting him to declare it a crime scene.Investigators were also at the Tucson home of Savannah Guthrie’s sister, Annie Guthrie, at the weekend as “part of a follow-up search in the normal course of the case”, NBC reported, citing an unnamed law enforcement official.Nancy Guthrie has limited mobility and requires daily medication for her condition to keep her alive, her family has said.Explore more on these topicsArizonanewsShareReuse this content"

Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff. I can’t sugarcoat it any more. So I’ve had to take decisive, urgent action to set us on a different path.”Washington Post publisher Will Lewis abruptly resigns amid criticism of staff cutsRead moreIt turned out to be one of the few times that Lewis would address the whole company. On Saturday evening, Lewis, 56,abruptly announced his resignation, just three days after the Postslashed nearly a third of its entire staffin one of the largest layoffs in US media history. Instead of putting the Post on a more promising financial path, Lewis’s two years were marked by controversy, clashes with staff and jargon-heavy initiatives that didn’t seem to amount to much.Ire over the cuts was mostly directed at Lewis and the Post’s billionaire owner,Jeff Bezos. While Lewis nominally ran the company, it was left to top editor Matt Murray to deliver the news of the cuts during an early morning Zoom meeting.View image in fullscreenThe Washington Post newsroom after the inauguration of its headquarters in Washington DC, on 28 January 2016.Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesBut while he was a no-show for the meeting,Lewis was spotted a day laterat the pre-game festivities for theSuper Bowlby a former Post sports reporter, who noted his appearance came after he took apart the sports section, including football coverage.While current and former staffers have suspicions aboutwhy, the bigger – and still unanswered – question about Lewis’s departure iswhy now? Lewis had long been unpopular with many Post employees and seemed to have made little progress in his business-side efforts. A senior Post journalist told the Guardian in November that Lewis was “universally reviled”.“I was surprised by the timing. I was not surprised by the outcome,” Ruth Marcus, whoresigned as a Post columnistin March 2025 after 40 years at the publication, said in an interview.“The news of Lewis’s departure triggered a thousand celebratory messages and emojis – we were popping the digital champagne, caseloads of it,” said a longtime Post staff writer who was not authorized to comment. “Here was a man who’d been handed the reins of one of the world’s most storied journalistic institutions and who seemed, almost from the start, like a man who hated the job and hated us.”Still, many Post employees believed that Bezos was not particularly interested in what they thought of Lewis. (Lewis did not respond to messages seeking comment.)The Financial Timesreportedthat senior management at the Post were “livid” about Lewis’s appearance at the Super Bowl and disliked the optics of him appearing at a glamorous event a day after hundreds of employees lost their livelihoods.Some Post staffers, though, have pointed out that Bezos had not previously seemed concerned about optics; in June 2025,a month after the Post announcedthat it would once again incentivize staffers to leave the company via buyouts, Bezos and his now wife Lauren Sanchezhosted a foam partyon a $500m yacht in advance of their star-studded wedding in Venice. (A Post spokesperson did not respond when asked whether Lewis’s Super Bowl cameo factored into his departure.)Some Post staffers, including Marcus, were initially encouraged when Lewis was named to the job in November 2023. Early on, she recalled getting personal emails from Lewis complimenting her columns.“The first time I met him was at a reception and I said: ‘Hi, I’m Ruth Marcus. I’m your pen pal.’ And he said: ‘Oh, can I give you a hug? Your stuff is great.’ I was initially well-disposed toward him – until I wasn’t.”Sally Quinn, a former Post writer and the widow of the former Post executive editor Ben Bradlee, was asked to welcome Lewis to the Post and to introduce him aroundWashington DC.She invited him to events and they had dinner every few months, she said. “We got along really well,” Quinn recalled. “He was very charming and funny and smart and we had a good time. He seemed very excited and upbeat about the job, so I was looking forward to working with him.”But Quinn said she stopped hearing from Lewis after he faced blowback for his handling of the ouster of Sally Buzbee as executive editor in early June 2024. “He stopped calling and emailing,” she said. “I think he just didn’t want to know what I had to say.”There were signs early on that Lewis would be hampered by his past. Even before assuming the job, Lewis told a Post reporter that he would not comment on allegations that he had helped cover up a major hacking scandal at Murdoch’s UK publications in the early 2010s as part of his work for News Corporation. (Lewis has not been found to have committed any wrongdoing.)But Lewis’s ties to that sordid period in British journalism continued to dog him, even as they were unlikely to have factored much into Bezos’s decision to oust him.View image in fullscreenJeff Bezos speaks onstage at Cape Canaveral, Florida, on 2 February.Photograph: Miguel J Rodriguez Carrillo/AFP/Getty ImagesEarly in his tenure, Lewis faced accusations, which he denied, ofinfringing on the Post’s coverageof a lawsuit filed by Britain’s Prince Harry against Murdoch’s British publishing operation that could have reflected on him and his work for the company.To get around the obvious conflict of interest,the Post tappedformer managing editor Cameron Barr to overseeinvestigative coverageof Lewisand Robert Winnett, a former colleague he had picked to replace Buzbee.“I think it was a credit to the Post to undertake and to provide the resources, which were extensive,” Barr recalled in an interview.Barr, who stepped down from the Post in 2023, described Lewis’s tenure as publisher as “ineffective”. “I don’t see that any of the initiatives that he launched have been a success,” he said. “It certainly hasn’t turned around the financial fortunes of the Post.”Ultimately, Lewis would get something of a reprieve in January 2025 when Prince Harry and Murdoch’s operationsettled the case. But questions about his past persisted. Last September, the Guardian reported that Lewis had played a prominent role in the effort to saveBoris Johnson’s prime ministership (Johnson, a former Telegraph colleague,knighted Lewisin 2023.)‘It’s an absolute bloodbath’: Washington Post lays off hundreds of workersRead morePart of Lewis’s supposed appeal for the job was his background as a reporter. Lewis got his start at the Financial Times in 1994, gradually rising through the ranks before becoming business editor for the Sunday Times. He reached the upper echelons of British journalism in 2005, when he became editor-in-chief of the Telegraph, receiving acclaim for overseeing coverage of a scandal revealing lawmakers who were using public funds for personal benefit.But, during that June 2024 meeting with staffers, Lewis immediately clashed with some of the Post’s most respected reporters.One of those reporters, the Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Carol D Leonnig,wrote in a post on Xon Monday that Lewis “showed his horrendous leadership when, at 1st staff mtg, he snapped at my question about his vision for ⁦⁦@washingtonpost. He had none. In 18 months, ⁦@JeffBezos let him wreck a national treasure.” Leonnig left the Post for MSNBC – now called MS Now – last summer.Lewis’s pick of Winnett to take over the newsroom turned out to be a disaster. Just a few weeks after his appointment, after his career wasscrutinized by the Postin a story headlined “Incoming Post editor tied to self-described ‘thief’ who claimed role in his reporting”, it was announced Winnett wouldstick with his jobas deputy editor of the Telegraph.As the business continued to flounder into early 2025, Post staffers found new reasons to lash out at Lewis.Late last April,some staffers chafed after readingthat the Post had thrown an ostentatious, over-the-top brunch to commemorate the annual White House correspondents’ dinner weekend.In May 2025, Lewis wasconspicuously absentwhen Post staffers gathered to celebrate their Pulitzer prize wins, which some staffers took as a sign that he didn’t value their journalism. (Staffers were told that Lewis was away on a long-planned trip.)All the while, Lewis rebuffed efforts by the Post’s unionized staffersto get him to participate in a town hallmeeting. Last month, amid widespread anxiety at the Post about layoffs, he wasin Davosinterviewing Bill Gates.At the end of last month, Lewis wasstill participatingin the pomp and circumstance of the job, reportedly attending the prestigious Alfalfa Club dinner, along with Bezos and Murray – once again giving no indication that he was on the outs with his boss.View image in fullscreenWashington Post newspapers displayed after widespread layoffs were announced on 5 February in Washington DC.Photograph: Douliery Olivier/Abaca/ShutterstockJust days before Lewis’s departure, Murray defended Lewisin an interview with Fox News. “Look, Will has been engaged with me very closely on this for a long time,” Murray said, explaining his absence by saying “he had a lot of things to tend to today.”Back in November 2023, when Lewis’s appointment wasfirst announced, Bezos said Lewis “embodies the tenacity, energy and vision needed for this role”. Lewis also had experience running a digital media startup, having launched the News Movement, a social media-focused venture, after leaving Dow Jones in 2020.In rare public remarks on Saturday, Bezos said the Post “has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity” and praised Jeff D’Onofrio, the business executive who will serve as acting publisher, along with Murray and opinions editor Adam O’Neal. He said nothing about Lewis.In a terse, subject-less email announcing his departure, Lewis thanked Bezos “for his support and leadership” throughout his time at the Post and, amid calls by some for Bezos to sell the paper, told staffers that “the institution could not have a better owner”.Explore more on these topicsWill LewisWashington PostUS press and publishingNewspapers & magazinesNewspapersWashington DCJeff BezosfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His friends think he’s “crazy”, he said. But the craze surrounding these platforms is rapidly gathering steam.Users can bet on virtually anything, from the outcome of Sunday’sSuper Bowlto whether the US will invadeGreenland, every second of every day.Hundreds of millions of dollars are now wagered each week, generating odds that users promptly screenshot, post and meme far and wide, from social media feeds to mainstream news networks.Polymarket and Kalshi, two of the leading platforms, collectively saw about $1.2bn in trading volume on Sunday,accordingto analysis by Piper Sandler, as the Super Bowl spurred a betting frenzy.Polymarket odds on which movie will win Best Picture at the Academy Awards“I wouldn’t describe it as gambling,” stressed Eldar, a student at Florida State University, but “a mix of betting and options trading”.“It’s not like when you go to the casino, and play against the house, and hope you get to win against the house,” he said. “That’s not what it is.”Zachary Azra, 20, sees things differently. “A prediction market is another way to gamble money that’s framed in a way that looks like good investments,” said Azra, an economics student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has been using the markets for five months.Gambling, at least in the conventional sense, is closely scrutinized – and, in some cases, significantly limited – by regulators. In Las Vegas, for example, you must be 21 to place a bet in a casino. Legalized sports betting platforms remain banned in some states, such as California and Texas, and are also prevented from serving users under the age of 21 in many of the states where they are allowed.Prediction market Kalshi reached $1bn in trading volume during Super BowlRead morePrediction markets are different. They are available in every state. They allow users as young as 18 to place bets. And they are not restricted to certain areas, like sports betting.As more and more money is bet on these platforms, whether or not they are, indeed, gambling platforms – and treated as such – is the subject of fierce debate. Should they be regarded as a legitimate, federally regulated product, or as a sneaky loophole that rewires gambling regulation?“These types of markets have been around for quite a long time,” said Harry Crane, a statistics professor at Rutgers University. But in the US, he added, they “have historically been limited to US gambling laws and betting laws, which are very restrictive”.But the leading platforms – like Polymarket and Kalshi – argue what their users are doing is more akin to investment.For years, the industry fought with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US federal agency responsible for overseeing financial derivative markets, for its leading operators to be treated as derivatives platforms, rather than betting platforms.Prediction markets say they offer “event contracts”, tied to events where the payoff structure is binary. Either the event occurs and a payment is made, or it does not and no payment is made. If you bet the Seahawks wouldclinch Sunday’s Super Bowl, you’d receive winnings; if you bet on the Patriots, you would not.They are regulated as financial products – despite the fact that they can look and feel indistinguishable from gambling.The Biden administration tried to crack down on the market. In November 2024, the FBIraidedthe home of Shayne Coplan, the CEO of Polymarket, for allegedly allowing US-based users to bet on the site despite a ban. Polymarket claimed the raid was retaliation for its users betting overwhelmingly that Donald Trump would win the election.The Trump administration has taken a markedly less tough stance on the industry – with which it has close ties. Donald Trump Jr, the president’s eldest son, is currently both an investor in and an unpaid adviser to Polymarket, as well as a paid adviser to Kalshi. And Trump’s social media company, the Trump Media & Technology Group, recently announced it would start its own platform called Truth Predict.The president’s business empire is getting involved in an industry which is an increasingly visible force in politics. Less than two years ago, prediction markets dominated discussion around the presidential election campaign as Trumpboasted that “gambling polls”put him far further ahead than convention opinion polls. Now a string of established media outlets have signed partnership deals with Polymarket and Kalshi, lending them afresh layer of legitimacyby quoting their odds in news coverage.Crane, the Rutgers professor, suggested that prediction markets have benefited from traditional media outlets and polling organizations losing credibility with a large segment of the population. People are still “interested in knowing the truth” about outcomes, he said. “Finding an alternative that’s not relying on the legacy media and the legacy polling outlets is appealing.”On Polymarket, ‘privileged’ users made millions betting on war strikes and diplomatic strategy. What did they know beforehand?Read more“Lots of people are very interested in politics, and they want to know what the true state of the world is,” said Grant Ferguson, a political science instructor at Texas Christian University. A key draw of prediction markets is their speed and constant availability. “That market updates all the time. It’s not like the stock market that has set hours. It’s open all the time, 24/7,” Ferguson said.During election campaigns, Ferguson noted, prices can swing “during debates or when early voting returns start coming in”, delivering an always-on indicator that feels more immediate than a poll that could be released days after it was initially collected.But Eldar, an economics major at Florida State, pushed back on the idea that prediction market odds could serve as an alternative for political polling. “It’s another tool,” he said. “I don’t think it’s a replacement for polls at all.”The relationship is intertwined, according to Eldar. “You need the polls in order to decide the odds, and the odds play off the polls,” he said.Unlike sports betting, where professional athletes who typically decide the outcome of bets are more often than not banned from placing bets themselves, prediction markets in politics allow users to gamble on elections their votes can help decide. And through feedback loops, these markets could (and probably have) influenced the very events they claim to predict.Widely cited market odds one way or another could “absolutely” influence voters or political narratives in a campaign, said Ferguson. For example, if a market suggested one party would win an election with an overwhelming probability, some voters might not see a point in casting their individual votes. “The vast majority of people do not understand prediction markets to the same degree as they think they might,” he cautioned.Concerns of insider tradingalso loom large.Prediction markets thrive on what Crane called “the moment the first person finds the information”, and are designed to reward people who are “better at getting information, faster at getting information”, oftentimes in ways that appear suspicious.Polymarket odds on whether Trump will acquire Greenland before 2027Bets on the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado winning the 2025 Nobel peace prizespiked shortly before the official announcement, for example, prompting allegations of insider trading. It was later determined that the leak was probablycreated by scrapingalready public metadata from the Nobel prize website.“The information was, for all intents and purposes, publicly available, even if it wasn’t readily available,” Crane said, raising questions about where the line is drawn for what should and shouldn’t be considered insider trading in the world of prediction markets.Gambling platform Polymarket not paying bets on US invasion of VenezuelaRead moreThe New York representative Ritchie Torresintroduced draft legislationin January – designed to curb the risk of insider trading by federal officials and their staff – after what his office described as a suspicious Polymarket trade timed around the US operation in Venezuela. A new account placed a bet of more than $30,000 on Polymarket that Nicolás Maduro would be removed from office hours before the raid began.“People do not like the idea of members of Congress engaging in any kind of financial transactions that might border on corruption,” said Ferguson.As Polymarket operates on a blockchain, making it an ideal platform for a trader who doesn’t want to be identified, Eldar noted it would be hard to enforce a ban on officials. “I’m all for it,” he said. “But I just don’t see how it’s going to work.”There is widespread concern that prediction markets carry the same dangers as gambling. “The buying and selling of futures contracts via prediction markets carries substantially similar levels of risk to the consumer as traditional sports betting, including risks associated with chasing losses, impulsive behavior, financial harm, and the development or escalation of gambling-related harm,” said Cait Huble, director of public affairs at the National Council on Problem Gambling.She added: “As consumers engaging with prediction markets may not recognize their activity as functionally gambling, irrespective of whether legally defined as such, they may be less likely to demonstrate responsible gambling behavior or seek support for a gambling problem.”Prediction markets should come with a warning, according to Azra. “The same way we see people with cancer from smoking, I think we should be the same way about prediction markets, explaining how this is a form of gambling along with all the consequences,” he said. “People should know you most likely won’t make money from this.”While none of his friends currently partake in prediction markets, Azra doesn’t think it’ll stay that way for long. “I see a future where they get more and more popular,” he said. “And I think eventually almost everybody will be into them trying to make quick money if precautions and restrictions aren’t taken.”Without intervention, odds are he’s right.Explore more on these topicsGamblingThe big betUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In September, the White Houseannouncedthat it would open 13.1m acres (5.3m hectares) of public land to coal mining and provide $625m for coal-fired power plants.Coal, which is the most polluting and costly fossil fuel, has declined sharply in the US over the past three decades. According to theEnergy Information Administration, US coal production in 2023 was less than half of its 2008 level, and coal plants generated only about 15% of US electricity in 2024, down from roughly 50% in 2000.The award adds to aseries of honors and giftsthat Trump has received from business executives, world leaders, cabinet members and others since the start of his second term.In December, the president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino, awarded Trump the newly created“Fifa peace prize”, and in November a group of Swiss billionairesgaveTrump a gold Rolex desk clock and a $130,000 engraved gold bar, after which Trumpagreed to reduce tariffson Switzerland.Over the summer, Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, gifted Trump an engraved glass diskstatuewith a base made from 24-karat gold. Soon after, the White House granted Apple an exemption from a 100% tariff on semiconductors.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpCoalUS militaryTrump administrationEnergyFossil fuelsUS domestic policynewsShareReuse this content"

A recording of his speech published on an internal Salesforce site was edited to cut his remarks about ICE,Business Insiderreported.Border patrol chief praised federal agent who shot US citizen in ChicagoRead moreThe incident comes as hundreds of Salesforce workersreportedly planto urge Benioff to denounce ICE and cancel future business with the agency, Wired and CNBC reported.Much like other billionaires, Benioff’s politics appear to have taken a marked turn in Trump’s second term. He for years was closely aligned with some liberal causes, including a 2018 measure in San Francisco to tax large corporations in the city to fund homeless services, and in aninterview with the Guardiancriticized billionaires for “hoarding” their wealth.Last fall, Beniofftoldthe New York Times he “fully supported” the president, and said Trump should send national guard troops to San Francisco, beforeapologizingand walking those comments back. His company, which has long had contracts with ICE, has sought to increase its business with the agency.Now he faces outrage within his company and others with ties to Salesforce over his recent jokes about international employees, ICE and a remark about not understanding Bad Bunny’s recent Super Bowl performance. Employees have condemned his comments on Slack and LinkedIn.Farone Rasheed, a Salesforce employee,wroteon the networking site: “I am fearful for my friends and co-workers on my team who are here on international visas … I am shocked, angered, sad and frustrated by the views espoused by the leadership at Salesforce this week. I’m sharing this here because, frankly, I fear retaliation for that.”Rob Seaman, Slack’s general manager, wascriticalof Benioff’s comments in an internal company message, according to Business Insider.“I want to acknowledge the jokes that happened this morning at CKO,” Seaman wrote, the outlet reported. “I cannot defend or explain them. They do not align with my personal values and I know this to be the case for many of you as well.”Salesforce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

On Wednesday, he warned Republicans against voting for the resolution, which GOP leaders had worked to forestall.“Canada has taken advantage of the United States on Trade for many years,” Trump wrote in a separate post. “They are among the worst in the World to deal with, especially as it relates to our Northern Border. TARIFFS make a WIN for us, EASY. Republicans must keep it that way!”The measure next goes to the Senate.Trump believes in the power of tariffs to force trading partners to the negotiating table. But US lawmakers are facing unrest from businesses caught in the trade wars and constituents navigating pocketbook issues and high prices.The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, said Trump’s tariffs were “causing prices to skyrocket and creating unnecessary uncertainty for American families”.“For months, sycophantic Republicans in the House have tried to block us from acting on behalf of the American people,” Jeffries said in a statement after the resolution was approved. “Today, House Democrats forced a successful vote to detonate theTrump tariffson Canada.”The high-stakes moment provides a snapshot of the House’s unease with the president’s direction, especially ahead of the midterm elections as economic issues resonate among voters. The Senate has already voted to reject Trump’s tariffs on Canada and other countries in a show of displeasure. But both chambers would have to approve the tariff rollbacks, and send the resolution to Trump for the president’s signature – or veto.Trump recently threatened to impose a 100% tariff on goods imported from Canada over that country’s proposed China trade deal, intensifying a feud with the longtime US ally and its prime minister, Mark Carney.The House speaker, Mike Johnson, tried to prevent the showdown.Johnson insisted lawmakers wait for a pending supreme court ruling in a lawsuit about the tariffs. He engineered a complicated rules change to prevent floor action. But Johnson’s strategy collapsed late on Tuesday, as Republicans peeled off during a procedural vote to ensure the Democratic measure was able to advance.“The president’s trade policies have been of great benefit,” Johnson had said. “And I think the sentiment is that we allow a little more runway for this to be worked out between the executive branch and the judicial branch.”Late Tuesday evening, Johnson could be seen speaking to holdout Republican lawmakers as the GOP leadership team struggled to shore up support during a lengthy procedural vote, but the numbers lined up against him.“We’re disappointed in what the people have done,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House’s national economic council, told reporters at the White House on Wednesday morning. “The president will make sure they don’t repeal his tariffs.”The resolution put forward by Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House foreign affairs committee, would terminate the national emergency that Trump declared a year ago as one of his executive orders.The administration claimed illicit drug flow from Canada constituted an unusual and extraordinary threat that allows the president to slap on tariffs on imported goods outside the terms of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.The Republican chair of the House foreign affairs committee, Brian Mast of Florida, said the drug flow of fentanyl into the US was a dire national emergency and the policy must be left in place.“Let’s be clear again about what this resolution is and what it’s not. It’s not a debate about tariffs. You can talk about those, but that’s not really what it is,” Mast said. “This is Democrats trying to ignore that there is a fentanyl crisis.”Experts say fentanyl produced by cartels in Mexico is largely smuggled into the US from land crossings in California and Arizona. Fentanyl is also made in Canada and smuggled into the US, but to a much lesser extent.Ahead of voting, some rank-and-file Republican lawmakers expressed unease over the choices ahead as Democrats – and a few renegade Republicans – impressed on their colleagues the need to flex their power as the legislative branch rather than ceding so much power to the president to take authority over trade and tariff policy.Don Bacon of Nebraska said he was unpersuaded by Johnson’s call to wait until the supreme court makes its decision about the legality of Trump’s tariffs.“Why doesn’t the Congress stand on its own two feet and say that we’re an independent branch?” Bacon said. “We should defend our authorities. I hope the supreme court does, but if we don’t do it, shame on us.”Bacon, who is retiring rather than facing re-election, also argued that tariffs were bad economic policy.Other Republicans said they were still making up their minds after Johnson’s gambit – which would have paused the calendar days to prevent the measure from coming forward – was turned back.“At the end of the day, we’re going to have to support our president,” said Keith Self of Texas.Darrell Issa, a California Republican, said he did not want to tie the president’s hands on trade and was ready to support the tariffs on Canada “at this time”.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsHouse of RepresentativesUS politicsTariffsDonald TrumpCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Long promoted byFrance, “Buy European” could mean imposing requirements on governments to prioritise locally manufactured goods in public contracts.Later this month, the EU executive will publish an Industrial Accelerator Act, which is expected to set targets for European content in a range of strategic products, such as solar panels and electric vehicles.In a show of unity, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Friedrich Merz arrived together at the 16th-century Belgian castle. “We share this sense of urgency that Europe must take action,” Macron said.Merz said: “We want to make thisEuropean Unionfaster, we want to make it better, and above all we want to ensure that we have competitive industry in Europe.”But the two leaders have struck different tones on European preference. Macrontold European newspapers this weekthat European preference should be focused on certain strategic sectors, such as clean technologies, chemicals, steel, automotive and defence, “otherwise Europeans will be swept aside”.He described European preference as “a defensive measure” and essential because “we are facing unfair competitors who no longer respect the rules of the World Trade Organization”.Merz, however, said “Made in Europe” rules may be too narrow and he favoured “Made with Europe” rules that favoured trading partners. He is championing a more aggressive deregulation agenda and trade deals.Ireland’s prime minister, Michéal Martin, said: “We must protect the open free trade ethos of the European Union in my view. And so there will be debates around that.”Merz and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, skirted the issue in a recent joint paper but found common ground on “legislative self-restraint”, or less EU regulation. Both would like the EU’s deregulation agenda to go further.In another sign of the vitality of the Berlin-Rome partnership,Italy, Germany and Belgium co-hosted a pre-summit gathering of 19 member states. The Italian prime minister’s office, the Palazzo Chigi, said the group discussed initiatives needed to “relaunch Europe’s industry”, including a review of the emissions trading system, the EU’s carbon pricing system.The flourishing German-Italian partnership has raised questions about the health of the Franco-German relationship, the traditional motor of the European project. Despite a rapprochement in Franco-German relations since Merz’s election, Paris and Berlin diverge on key economic questions.Merz and Macron also disagree on the EU’slong-sought trade deal with Mercosur. While the German leader has called for speedy entry into force of the agreement with South American countries, Macron dismissed it as “a bad deal”.Von der Leyen has also sounded a cautious note about “Buy European”. Speaking in the European parliament on Wednesday, she said European preference was “a necessary instrument” in strategic sectors. “But I want to be clear – it is a fine line to walk,” she said, adding that every proposal must be “underpinned by robust economic analysis and be in line with our international obligations”.The Buy European question is only one part of a sprawling summit agenda at Alden Biesen in Limburg, an estate founded in the 13th century by Teutonic knights. Leaders discussed deregulation, fragmented capital markets that constrain green and digital investment, and barriers in the European single market that hamper trade.Von der Leyen told MEPs there was “too much gold-plating” – extra layers of national regulation that made life harder for business. As an example, she said a truck in Belgium was allowed to weigh 44 tonnes but could carry only 40 tonnes if it crossed into France.The leaders heard from Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta, two former Italian prime ministers who produced agenda-setting reports on the economy. Draghisaid last weekthat the current economic world order was “dead” and Europe risked becoming “subordinated, divided and deindustrialised at once”.He said Europe needed to move from “confederation to federation”, adding that veto power for individual member states in key policies made countries “vulnerable to being picked off one by one”.Acknowledging the EU’s difficulties in taking decisions, von der Leyen said she was open to moving ahead with passing laws on integrating the EU’s capital markets in a smaller formation, if there was no agreement at 27.“We have to make progress and tear down the barriers that prevent us from being a true global giant,” she said, referencing plans for integrating the European financial system.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropeGlobal economyEconomicsFranceGermanyItalynewsShareReuse this content"

But having seen their lead at the top whittled down to three points since the weekend, Mikel Arteta’s side showed their fallibility as they were held by a dogged Brentford side who felt that they should have even claimed victory.Just when they needed to put in a statement performance,Arsenalwere edgy throughout and struggled to create anything of note until Noni Madueke opened the scoring. Keane Lewis-Potter’s equaliser that came from a Michael Kayode long throw was fully deserved as Keith Andrews’ side showed exactly why they are enjoying such a successful season since he stepped up to replace Thomas Frank last summer.Brentford v Arsenal: Premier League – liveRead moreHad Igor Thiago not blazed over in injury-time after Cristhian Mosquera and then Declan Rice had both made last-ditch tackles, it could have been even worse for Arsenal. Gabriel Martinelli could also have won it late on but he was denied by a diving save from Caoimhín Kelleher. After three successive runner-up finishes, it promises to be an anxiety-filled run-in for their long-suffering supporters.Arteta had insisted before kickoff that his players would be able to shut out the noise despite City – as Pep Guardiola has put it – now breathing down their necks aftertheir win over Fulhamon Wednesday night. “For seven months we have been doing that. We are used to it,” said the Arsenal manager.But the absences of William Saliba and Kai Havertz due to illness and a muscle injury that the Germany forward picked up in thewin over Sunderlandproved to be vital as Arteta’s side looked jittery in defence and lacked creativity in attack. Eberechi Eze, who started for the first time in the Premier League for two months, looks a shadow of the player whoscored a hat-trickin the north London derby back in November and was unsurprisingly hooked for Martin Ødegaard at half-time. The England forward’s World Cup hopes are in serious jeopardy.The usually unflappable Gabriel Magalhães betrayed some of Arsenal’s early nerves when he passed the ball straight out for a corner in the third minute. Even at that stage, it looked set to be a battle of the set-pieces given both sides’ excellence in that department. Andrews had promised that his team like to “create chaos” and that was evident from their physical approach to every dead-ball situation in an attempt to unsettle their opponents. The former Republic of Ireland midfielder earned himself an early booking after protesting a decision that went against his side.View image in fullscreenNoni Madueke heads home to give Arsenal the lead at Brentford.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersIt was Gabriel who had the first sight of goal in the 10th minute when his header from a Rice corner was cleared by Sepp van den Berg. Brentford’s first opportunity came when David Raya gifted possession to Mathias Jensen as he attempted to launch a quick break. The Dane’s cross picked out Igor Thiago perfectly but somehow Raya was able to redeem himself against his former club by making a tremendous point-blank save.Brentford visibly grew in confidence and started to enjoy more possession, with Eze struggling to have an impact in his No 10 role. Viktor Gyökeres was full of energy but found himself isolated as Arsenal’s attacks lacked urgency. Arteta showed his frustration when Martín Zubimendi gave the ball away cheaply five minutes before half-time, although at least Arsenal started to look more threatening before the break. Chances were few and far between, however, with a shanked effort from Lewis-Potter summing up the quality on show.There was a heart-stopping moment for Arsenal at the start of the second half when Lewis-Potter jinked his way past Jurriën Timber and it required a timely intervention from Gabriel to block Igor Thiago’s shot. They continued to pen Brentford back but still hadn’t managed a shot on target after an hour, with a strike from Ødegaard sailing into the stands. “Top of the league, you’re having a laugh,” mocked the Brentford fans.Their jeers were silenced less than a minute later when Madueke – not exactly renowned for his heading ability – rose to meet Piero Hincapié’s excellent cross and directed his header across a helpless Kelleher. Lewis-Potter should have equalised almost immediately from a corner but headed wide as the game finally came alive. Kayode pinched the ball off Gyökeres’ toe just as he was about to score before Raya saved from Igor Thiago at the other end. Gabriel – having escaped being sent off when he chopped down Dango Ouattara after picking up an early yellow card – brilliantly blocked a shot from the marauding Kayode.Fittingly, it was the Italian’s long throw that caused panic in the Arsenal penalty area and allowed Lewis-Potter to equalise after Van den Berg’s flick-on that would have done a certain Steve Bould proud. “Set-piece FC,” sang the jubilant Brentford fans as Arsenal’s were left to fret over whether this could end up being yet another season with a disappointing twist in the tale.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrentfordArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Shocked to learn that a tax-exiled English expat who made his billions squeezing chemical plants doesn’t have liberal, let alone accurate, views on immigration. Or at least, in public anyway.It seems highly likely Sir Jim Ratcliffe knew what he was doing in the course of hisnow semi-recantedSky News interview. And it is above all vital that at least one part of his empire of influence – football, sport, Manchester United – rejects it, as the club have done to some extentin their statement.Guardian view on Sir Jim Ratcliffe: Britain does not need political lectures from a billionaire tax exile | EditorialRead moreWhen Ratcliffe bought his stake in United he made some initial attempts at presenting himself as a kind of billionaire of the people, our own clog-clapping son of the cobbles, Eccles cakes tumbling from his turn-ups, essentially on a mission of benevolent regeneration.In reality Ratcliffe was always here to sack the tea lady. Ineos has a highly successful set of methods. Strip it back. Cut the fat. Access funding. But then, becoming a billionaire is not an act of benevolent collectivism. It requires supreme self-serving narrow focus.This is simply the landscape. No doubt we can look forward to the owners of other Premier League football clubs, for example the autocratic ruling families of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, disagreeing in the strongest terms with Big Sir Jim’s views, standing up for the little guy, calling for more gruel for everyone.So yes, there is this point of view. You could very easily be cynical, jaded, lost in realpolitik at the revelation that Ratcliffe feels it useful to pretend Britain is in economic difficulty because of an invading army of foreigners. And that Nigel Farage, arch deregulator, seems, in his disinterested view, an entirely reasonable voice on this topic.Let us be clear about what is happening here. There is very little chance Ratcliffe feels any of this deeply. But he does know that a slash-and-burn Reform government would be good for business. With his Ineos hat on Ratcliffe has spoken publicly about the problems of doing business in the current version of a non-EU UK. He wants a harder out.Immigration is just a wedge issue in this dynamic, a way of pressing those buttons. If Ratcliffe actually gives a personal toss about this, is actually losing any sleep about its effects on “everyday people”, I will gladly eat my own arm. This is pre-electioneering on behalf of the super-wealthy. A powerful person with skin in the game is trying to influence people into voting a certain way.0:38'The UK has been colonised by immigrants,' says Man United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe – videoAnd, yes, there is a so-what angle here. You can say whatever you like, particularly if you’re rich and powerful. Free speech is a thing, even factually incorrect free speech. But it does matter what Ratcliffe says, and for two very obvious reasons.First, the position he holds comes with responsibilities. Football is giving him this platform. Football in its current form is the greatest global megaphone ever devised. His views on this topic are being broadcast for one reason: because people like or wish to consumeManchester United.With this in mind the first responsibility is to get his facts right. Ratcliffe stated, incorrectly, that the UK population had increased by 12 million since 2020 which, if it were true, would be a genuine case of infrastructure breakdown. He also used the word “colonised” to describe the effects of immigration, a highly loaded and inflammatory word, deliberately chosen.And yeah he’s right in one way. Britain has been colonised by foreigners since the Beaker people. The Normans. The anglicised Saxons who gave Ratcliffe his name. But the language is grimly familiar. Colonisers don’t just arrive. They invade, take control, seize power. And what do you do with colonisers? You eject them, you rebel, you take up arms. Ratcliffe is not simply saying we have a problem with numbers or integration. His vocabulary is insisting on division and separation, the evil outside versus the good and the native.Does he really not know what “colonised” implies? Does a multibillionaire really not understand figures to the extent he can parrot something so obviously incorrect? Does he realise this kind of rhetoric prevents serious debate, takes away the ability of politicians to say, yes, maybe there is a problem, one that can be too quickly dismissed by those on the left who don’t perhaps appreciate the real-life pressures, or fear they too will be caught up in the rhetoric of racists and opportunists.Instead we have this, the language of the internet, misinformation and vitriol further normalised by our highest-profile football-coded billionaire. There is a playbook to be followed here. Ratcliffe has now semi-apologised, which means he can say he has actually apologised. But the substance of what he says will remain, echoing through the ecosystem, toxifying the soil.Farage has already noted the name check, another tick for the way power flows in this country. And again, this matters, because football gave Ratcliffe this platform. The Premier League’s tireless marketing arm is empowering it.Manchester United are being misused. For all the corporate gloss, United’s real power lies in their congealed but enduring status as a community object, a big tent, a place for all-comers. Their co-owner has no business using this carefully stitched thing to spread his political counter-messages.View image in fullscreenJim Ratcliffe has prompted protests from Manchester United fans during his tenure.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersThe city of Manchester is also being misrepresented. The line Ratcliffe is parroting is at odds with the city’s spirit, its football clubs, its sporting culture. Manchester is a port city built on generations of incomers. It’s a mixed-up muddled-up multipack of people bumping up against each other. Its energy is open, mix-and-match, outward-looking.To his credit Andy Burnham, who has cosied up in the past to the regeneration aspects of the Ratcliffe regime, has been quick to reject this targeted line. Burnham understands his city. He also understands what this is, the politics of endorsement and opportunity.And of course football itself is being weaponised. There is a moral issue, an issue of ownership, of sport once again co-opted by power. Very few things remain that have at their sclerotic and compromised heart an idea of community, openness, collectivism. More prosaically the Premier league, defined in its statutes as anti-prejudice and anti-division, is being piggybacked for a party political broadcast (with a bit of Keir Starmer thrown in, like an Ofcom-friendly disclaimer).We can still revolt against this pulling of the levers, see it for the spume of vomit it really is. We see you, corporate interests, the politics of fear. And no thank you, not here, not on our pitch. But the second point about Ratcliffe is, as ever, something more diffuse, a kind of sadness.It always feels like Manchester United are trying to tell you something. Why are people so obsessed with this club? Because it is basically Britain, a grand, sodden dying empire, decorously putrid, still just about operational for all the leaks and creaks and wet rot. How do we rewire and refurbish this thing? How do we generate energy, but also shed the drag of the past?Against this backdrop getting to know Sir Jim has been a deeply depressing project. First because he is a terrible club owner, so naive he seems to have genuinely believed he should have a say in the style of football. So vague on details he employed the world’s most rigidly deluded systems manager and gave him a squad of off-cuts and leftovers.There has also been a sense of wider doom watching him in action. Here we have someone who was at one point Britain’s richest man. This is what we’ve got. An icon of industry. Our own domestic titan. This is England, the safest hands we have, our own billionaire-dad, our finance Gandalf. And he appears to be completely clueless. Or at least deliberately, carelessly cynical in the way he presents himself.This is the creeping fear. Maybe there really are no grown-ups left on this mist-sodden island. Maybe dad really is an idiot. Either way, here we go again retailing bullshit, putting our hopes in a 73-year-old who can’t add up, out there using football as his radio, telling us the family next door are here to take our public services, so you’d better get out and vote for the guy most likely to empower my business.At some point everything in this picture can be rejected. Manchester United supporters may be stuck with Ratcliffe. But football, sport and everything in its arc can reject the things he is asking us to do, refuse to be spooked, refuse to fall into the arms of the opportunist he is promoting. Who knows, maybe one day this kind of messaging, its cynicism, its contempt for the public, may just flick a switch and drive us a little closer.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedJim RatcliffeFootball politicscommentShareReuse this content"

However, there was some consolation: her boyfriend, Connor Watkins, proposed to her near the finish line. Surrounded by members of the US Ski Team, Johnson said “Yes!” and the two embraced.Johnson said she had an idea Watkins would propose, although the exact location and timing was still a surprise. “I had told him that I always dreamed of getting proposed to at the Olympics, so I had an inkling,” Johnson said. “It felt fitting to kind of combine two of my loves. And I don’t know, it’s a special place at the Olympics. I feel like there’s a lot of mystique around it. And also you get free photography.”The couple met on a dating app and Watkins, who works in construction, said he initially had no idea who Johnson was. “I was a little taken aback. I had very little knowledge of ski racing and everything else,” said Watkins.Johnson said she was delighted to be leaving the Olympics with a ring and a medal. “I mean, who doesn’t want to leave with a couple pieces of metal?” she said.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsSkiingUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The alleged offences are said to have taken place in 2021 and 2022 when he was an Arsenal player.Partey pleaded not guilty to all those charges at Southwark crown court in September, where a trial date was set for 2 November 2026.Partey’s defence lawyer, Jenny Wiltshire, said: “Thomas Partey continues to deny all charges against him. He has cooperated with the police throughout. Given there are ongoing legal proceedings, there will be no further comment.”Partey was granted bail in relation to the initial charges on the same conditions he had previously been placed under, including that he cannot make contact with any of the three alleged victims and must inform police of any permanent changes of address or international travel.Partey was first charged in July four days after leaving Arsenal, who he joined in 2020. He has played 21 times for Villarreal this season and has continued playing for Ghana, making his most recent international appearance in a World Cup qualifier against Comoros in October 2025. Ghana have qualified for the World Cup.Explore more on these topicsFootballnewsShareReuse this content"

He and Roethlisbergerwon Super Bowl XLwith Pittsburgh at the end of the 2005 season.Porter said Roethlisberger and another former Steeler, James Harrison, had broken a code by criticizing Mike Tomlin, whodeparted as Pittsburgh head coachin January after 19 seasons in charge, on their own podcasts.Ben Roethlisberger was easy to admire as a quarterback, but not as a manRead more“[Harrison] broke the brotherhood,” Porter said on Cameron Heyward’s Not Just Football podcast. “Then [Roethlisberger] definitely broke the brotherhood. Out of anybody that should talk, he should never grab a microphone and really talk Steeler business. Because if we talk Steelers business, his ass is foul of all foul. The shit that he did is foul of all foul. He’s not a good teammate.“Won the Super Bowl with him, but the person, he’s just not a good teammate. He knows that. Anybody in the Steelers building knows that, but we protected him because I’ve only won one Super Bowl and that was my quarterback. So do I love my quarterback? Yeah, but is he a good person? No.”Porter backed up his comments by saying that Roethlisberger had once refused to sign memorabilia for his teammates’ families.“He was telling people, ‘No, I’m not going to sign that,’” Porter said. “So once he did that, who they come and tell? The captain. When he first did it to Chris Hoke, I was like, ‘Damn, that’s messed up, man.’ I grabbed it from Hoke, took it over there and told him to sign it. But then when he did that to Aaron Smith, now I got to have a meeting [with Roethlisberger]. Like, you’re a rookie, you’re a young guy.“You can’t tell my vets you’re too cool to sign for my vets. Who the hell is too cool to sign for your teammate? I’m not a fan.”Porter added that Roethlisberger was appointed Steelers team captain, rather than being voted in by his fellow players.“He came in the era where they just gave you the ‘C’ – because if he wasn’t a captain, he’d probably have a hissy fit. But nobody’s going to vote for him as captain because he don’t have no captain quality,” Porter said.Before Tomlin’s departure from the Steelers, Roethlisberger suggested his former coach should be fired, saying it was time for the team to “clean house”.Roethlisberger later backtracked on the comments. “Just because I said there’s a time for some new things, that’s just saying that I think Coach Tomlin, if he wants to move on, he has every right to move on – it’s not they should,” he said.Porter is not the only teammate to criticize Roethlisberger. After the quarterbackwas suspendedfor violating the NFL’s personal conduct policy after allegations of sexual assault, for which Roethlisberger was never criminally charged, Steelers receiver Hines Ward said the “suspension is justified”. Current Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph alsoappeared to back Porter’s commentson social media.Porter left the Steelers in 2007 and Roethlisberger admitted in 2010 that he had not behaved well in the past.“I got caught up being Big Ben the whole time,”Roethlisberger said. “I lost track of who Ben Roethlisberger was. It’s not something I’m proud of … I was gaining everything, but I was losing a lot of who I was raised to be.”Porter was a three-time All Pro linebacker during his time with the Steelers, and has retained links with the team in retirement. He was their outside linebackers coach from 2015 to 2018, and his son Joey Jr has played cornerback for the team since they drafted him in 2023.Explore more on these topicsPittsburgh SteelersNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Japan’s Mitsuki Ono took bronze with 85.00.For a sport that has spent nearly a decade orbiting Kim’s technical and competitive standard, the result felt seismic – not because she rode poorly, but because someone else finally assembled the perfect combination of risk, execution and timing on the night it mattered most.Winter Olympics 2026: Ukrainian athlete kicked out over helmet tribute, Lollobrigida claims dramatic speed skating gold – liveRead moreThe loss ends one of the most dominant Olympic streaks in modern winter sport. Kim entered the Games as a two-time defending Olympic champion and the overwhelming favorite to complete a three-peat no snowboarder had ever achieved. Instead, the history belongs to someone else.The victory came less than six weeks after Kimdislocated her left shoulder, an injury that threatened to derail her Olympic buildup. Instead, the brace she wore throughout the competition became part of the story: a visible reminder of vulnerability for an athlete who has spent most of her career appearing nearly untouchable. Among those watching from the bottom of the pipe was her boyfriend, NFL star Myles Garrett, stationed near the photo pit with a camera in hand as he tracked each run.Kimfirst arrived as a global phenomenonat Pyeongchang 2018, when she became the youngest woman to win Olympic snowboard gold. Four years later in Beijing, she defended the title while navigating the expectations that come with being the face of a sport. In Livigno, the challenge was different: maintaining dominance while the rest of the field spent eight years trying to catch her.The final unfolded in three distinct phases: Kim setting the benchmark, the field chasing, and Choi delivering the decisive moment.View image in fullscreenChoi Gaon’s rebounded from a fall on her opening run for a stellar finish to secure the gold medal in Livigno.Photograph: Jeff Pachoud/AFP/Getty ImagesKim dropped in late in the start order and immediately established control with a composed opening run built around a backside 720, switch backside air and cab double cork 1080 sequence, finishing with the kind of amplitude and landing precision that judges consistently reward. Her 88.00 put immediate pressure on the rest of the field and held deep into the competition.Ono secured bronze early with a technically clean but slightly lower-ceiling run that topped out at 85.00, while riders including Japan’s Sara Shimizu and China’s Cai Xuetong pushed difficulty but lost ground on execution or amplitude in a final littered with crashes as snow swirled through the floodlit venue.Choi’s path to gold was far less straightforward. The 17-year-old World Cup leader – competing in her first Olympics – crashed heavily on her opening run after clipping the lip of the pipe, flipping upside down and landing hard. She lay on the snow for several minutes as medical staff attended to her, briefly raising fears she might withdraw.She eventually rode down under her own power but later revealed she had hurt her knee in the fall and struggled to walk immediately afterward.“After the first run, I actually cried really hard, thinking maybe I should just quit the Olympics here,” Choi said. “But the thought kept coming back to me: ‘You can do this. You have to go on.’”Her second run ended in another fall, leaving her medal hopes hanging by a thread. But on her final attempt – needing something close to perfect – she delivered exactly that, combining speed, amplitude and technical depth across her full line to post 90.25, the highest score of the night.“It’s the kind of story you only see in dreams,” she said. “Mentally it was so tough, but right now I am the happiest.”Winter Olympics: Chloe Kim settles for silver in snowboard halfpipe – as it happenedRead moreThe moment instantly flipped the pressure back to Kim, who still had a final run remaining but now needed to improve. She attempted to raise the difficulty ceiling, including a progression toward back-to-back double cork combinations, but could not put down a cleaner score than her opening benchmark.The result underscored how narrow the margins have become in women’s halfpipe. Kim still posted the top single score outside Choi and finished comfortably ahead of the rest of the field, but Olympic finals rarely allow room for anything less than perfection.Choi’s victory also signals a generational shift in a discipline increasingly dominated by teenage progression riders. Born in 2008 andmentored by Kim herself, she represents a new wave raised entirely in the technical ecosystem Kim helped create.The broader field reflected that evolution. Seven of the top eight finishers were 23 or younger, and multiple finalists attempted double-cork-level difficulty as standard competitive content rather than high-risk bonus tricks.For Kim, the result does little to diminish a career that has already reshaped the sport. She remains a two-time Olympic champion, three-time world champion and the rider most responsible for pushing the technical baseline of modern women’s halfpipe. She said she will undergo surgery on her shoulder after returning home.“I haven’t been able to practice as much as I would’ve liked,” Kim said. “A month ago, I wasn’t even sure if I would be here. I get emotional thinking about it. I really worked so hard to get here. This medal means so much to me.”But on a snowy night in Livigno, the sport finally moved – if only slightly – beyond Kim’s orbit. And for the first time in nearly a decade, Olympic halfpipe gold belonged to someone else.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUSA Olympic teamSnowboardingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

So did anybody really believe that Ukraine’s Vladyslav Heraskevych would lose his when the world’s eyes were upon him?Not the International Olympic Committee, who flipped between threats of expulsion and sweet talk over the past fortnight, without coming close to changing his mind. And certainly not those of us who have spoken and messaged Heraskevych, and found a manutterly prepared to sacrifice his dreamof winning a Winter Olympic medal for a higher purpose.‘It’s emptiness’: banned Ukrainian athlete accuses IOC of fuelling Russia’s propagandaRead moreIn public and private his message was the same: he would not back down. And if the IOC barred from competing in his “helmet of memory”, which commemorates some of the 600 Ukrainian athletes and coaches killed by Russian bombs and bullets since 2022, he would accept his fate.And when the moment came, shortly before 8.30am on Thursday, he met it with a powerful but resolute message:“This is price of our dignity,”alongside a photo of his helmet.For the IOC it must have been like watching a public relations car crash from the passenger seat. One that everyone knew was going to happen – and nothing could be done about it.Partly that was because Heraskevych’s messaging was so clever and precise. He didn’t focus on statements about Russian aggression. Instead hespoke powerfullyof wanting to honour his fallen friends. That allowed him to claim his message didn’t violate the IOC’s rules banning political expression on the field of play. Did everyone believe it? No. But it was a deft sidestep.Heraskevych also cut through with his claims that the IOC was inconsistent in its application of its rules over athlete expression. At the opening ceremony, for instance, his fellow skeleton racer, Israel’s Jared Firestone, wore a commemorative kippah to remember the 11 victims ofthe Munich massacre at the 1972 Games, which said: “We remember. We endure. We rise.”This week the US skater Maxim Naumov, wholost his parents in the Potomac air collisionlast year, honoured them by holding up a photograph in their memory after he competed. Why, Heraskevych pointed out, was his case any different?Finally, as he stated in his submission to the court of arbitration for sport in an attempt to overturn his ban on Thursday evening, was the IOC’s decision really proportionate?View image in fullscreenUkraine’s Vladyslav Heraskevych, with his helmet, which features pictures of people killed in the war with Russia.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAAll that said, the IOC did try avert one of the most controversial moments of recent Olympics. Its president, Kirsty Coventry, went to Cortina in a last-ditch attempt to break the impasse. The fact that she did so, and was in tears afterwards, said a lot about her compassion and leadership style.However, allowing Heraskevychto use his helmet in practiceand letting him wear a black armband in competition was never going to be enough to change his mind.This is not the IOC of her predecessor, Thomas Bach, who seemed to only smile in public when votes were needed at elections.And this is certainly not the IOC of a generation or two ago. When Tommie Smith and John Carlos were kicked out for theirblack power salute at the 1968 Olympicsit came at the urging of the then IOC president Avery Brundage – a man who repeatedly defended Nazi Germany before and after the 1936 Games when president of the US Olympic Committee.Brundage was at it again in 1972 in Munich when the American 400m athletes Vincent Matthews and Wayne Collettwere given a lifetime banfrom the Olympics after turning their backs to the US flag on the podium. “A disgusting display,” he called it.View image in fullscreenThe International Olympic Committee president, Kirsty Coventry, tries to explain the decision to disqualify Heraskevych to the media.Photograph: Kirsty Coventry/APSo times have changed. But the problem the IOC has is that it clings to the old lie that sport and politics can be separated. Remember that it was only last week that the IOC – along with Fifa –was making noises about bringing Russia backinto the sporting fold.This is the same Russia that tried to hack the Milano Cortina website before these Games. Thatlaunched a sophisticated cyber-attackat the Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Pyeongchang. And, most famously of all, corrupted the 2014 Winter Games in Sochiby doping its athletes– with a scheme that involved using a mousehole to swap steroid-riddled urine samples with clean ones.Russia has, according to Ukraine, also destroyed more than 800 sports facilities, including over 20 Olympic, Paralympic and Deaflympic training centres.I am not convinced the IOC was doing Russia’s propaganda for them, as Heraskevych and the Global Athlete organisation has claimed. But it was certainly a terrible look to ban an athlete for wanting to pay homage to his friends, while his country is being hit with ballistic missiles and you have recently made cooing noises to Russia.The question is, could the IOC have done anything differently? Perhaps. But the stumbling block was always going to be that it saw Heraskevych’s helmet – rightly or wrongly – as violating one of its core tenets: that the field of play must be entirely neutral and free of political and social protest.Team GB’s Matt Weston leads golden charge as skeleton rivals unite behind banned UkrainianRead moreAs one insider put it to me, if the “helmet of memory” had been approved, the IOC could have potentially opened up Pandora’s box and set a precedent. Could you imagine the furore if the Iranian government forced its athletes to mourn the head of the revolutionary guard, say, after he was assassinated?But perhaps there was a way. After all, if the IOC was able to set up an independent panel to decide whether Russians could compete as Authorised Neutral Athletes, why could they not have done the same for Heraskevych and other such cases? And maybe the IOC could have even looked the other way, and allowed him to compete. It would have made a ripple, for sure. But a day later we would have been on to the nextski jumping penisgateorbiathlete cheating on his girlfriendstory. That’s how fast the Olympics news cycle moves.But there is one thing we can say for certain: Heraskevych has got the horrors of the war in Ukraine back on the agenda, which was his aim all along.The Russian team will be back at the Winter Paralympics later this month. And last week there were suggestions that the Olympic team would be reinstated this year. The latter decision has surely been pushed back now.So while Heraskevych has lost his battle to compete – at least until Cas rules – he has taken a stand that will live long in the memory, and certainly won the public relations war.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsInternational Olympic CommitteeUkraineSport politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

At theseWinter Olympics, the Americans have a new cult hero: Curling Rambo.Aidan Oldenburg, a member of the US men’s curling team, has attracted attention for his glasses, thick thatch of hair and red bandana. His appeal as an unlikely hero has drawncomparisons with Stephen Nedoroscik, USA’s bespectacled, Rubik’s Cube-solving gymnastics hero who won two bronze medals at the Paris Olympics.Like Nedoroscik, the 24-year-old Oldenburg has hobbies away from his sport. He is an avid juggler, and has introduced machetes and flaming torches into his routine. His dream growing up was to become an environmental scientist rather than an Olympian, and he has achieved both. His day job involves working with solar and wind projects after graduating with a bachelor’s degree in ecology.Stephen Nedoroscik: USA’s bespectacled, Rubik’s Cube-solving gymnastics heroRead moreHe says he started wearing a bandana, similar to the one worn by Sylvester Stallone in the Rambo movies, as “a bit of a joke” at a tournament last year.“We had two games left that we had to play,” he said. “I was like, let’s have some fun. So an hour and a half before our game, I was like, I’m going to go buy some headbands, I’ll have everyone wear them.”When Oldenburg’s team, skipped by Danny Casper, later qualified for the Olympics he decided the bandana was here to stay.“No one else has the hair for it on our team,” Oldenburg said. “My hair used to be longer than this. It’s all like a kind of utility and, honestly, it’s so hot out there in the arena, it helps to keep the sweat out of my eyes.”Fans have also started wearing bandanas in tribute to their new hero.“They don’t have easy access to team uniforms and stuff like that,” Oldenburg said. “In other sports like football or baseball, you go buy your favorite player’s uniform and wear it in the stands. The headband, it’s nice and it’s cheap. It’s pretty fun, too.”Nedoroscik has also given his seal of approval.“I just want to say I came across your story,” Nedoroscik said in a video message he sent to Oldenburg, “and I found you to be such a cool, interesting dude.”The US men’s team won their tournament opener on Wednesday against the Czech Republic but lost to Switzerland on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026CurlingWinter OlympicsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the controversy surrounding the event is not merely a debate over artistic and technical merits.Gold went bya narrow marginto the French duo of Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron. It was a stunning achievement for a partnership that is less than a year old. But the union was forged after the fallout from sexual assault allegations levelled at Fournier Beaudry’s boyfriend and former ice dance partner, while Cizeron is the subject of allegations of abusive conduct from his erstwhile skating partner.Nikolaj Sørensen, a 36-year-old Danish-Canadian ice dancer who is dating Fournier Beaudry, was banned by the Canadian skating governing body for at least six years in 2024 for “sexual maltreatment” related to allegations that he sexually assaulted an American coach and former skater in 2012. He denied the accusations and the suspension wasoverturned in 2025on a technicality relating to questions of jurisdiction.Winter Olympics 2026: Ukrainian athlete kicked out over helmet tribute, Lollobrigida claims dramatic speed skating gold – liveRead moreFournier Beaudry has consistently defended Sorensen. They began skating together in 2012 and started dating the following year. In a recent Netflix documentary series, Glitter & Gold, she said felt like “collateral damage”.She added: “When they decided to suspend him, it meant that his career was over, which also meant that my career was over … This was extremely difficult because it was not only about skating, it was about my integrity, it was about his integrity. I know my boyfriend 100%. I know him. And we [stood] strong together.”The 31-year-old Cizeron has been accused of inappropriate behaviour by the French ice dancer Gabriella Papadakis. On the ice together since they were 10, the pair won gold in Beijing in 2022. But in amemoirreleased last month in France, So as Not to Disappear, Papadakis described Cizeron as “often controlling, demanding and critical” and said she refused to skate with him unless a coach was present. Sheaccusedhim of “blood-chilling coldness” and said she was “terrified by the idea of finding myself alone with him”. Cizeron strongly rejected the claims, lamenting what he called a “smear campaign” and reportedly issuing a cease-and-desist letter.View image in fullscreenMadison Chock and Evan Bates, the reigning three-time world champions, narrowly missed out on their second Olympic gold.Photograph: Wu Hao/EPAPapadakis, who retired in December 2024, was dropped as a broadcaster by NBC last month after the book’s publication. The networktold the Athleticthat the circumstances made it impossible to guarantee that her commentary would be “free of bias – whether actual or perceived”.The allegations have made for an uneasy atmosphere in Italy. In the Netflix series, the former US Olympian turned media analyst Adam Rippon described the Fournier Beaudry-Cizeron partnership as possessing “sinister energy”. Born in Montreal, Fournier Beaudry represented Canada and Denmark before switching her allegiance to France and making her international competitive debut with Cizeron last October. The 33-year-old was granted French citizenship three months ago.In Milan the French pair, who also won a European Championships title in Sheffield last month, sought to deflect questions about the disputes, insisting they wanted to focus on their skating and exude “gratefulness”. But the woman who accused Sørensen of sexual assault said in astatementto the Canadian Press earlier this month that Fournier Beaudry’s defence of Sørensen fosters “a dangerous environment for skaters who need to report abuse … [and] further enforces the culture of silence in figure skating.”Fear and Gibson suffer nightmare on ice as GB Winter Olympic medal drought goes onRead moreMeanwhile, Chock and Bates, much-garlandedveteransin their fourth Olympics who married in 2024, were emotional after an outcome that Chock described as “bittersweet”. The pair, and many observers, felt their strong routine to a version of the Rolling Stones’ Paint It Black wasworthy of gold. However, the judges’ decision saw them awarded silver, only 1.43 points behind the French pair (who skated to saturnine music from the film The Whale) and ahead of the bronze-winning Canadians, Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier.“All four performances we had here at the Olympics, we’re very proud of,” Chocktold reporters. “They were flawless for us. We couldn’t have skated any better, and we’re super proud with how we took the ice, how we handled ourselves every time. The rest is out of our hands.”Explore more on these topicsWinter OlympicsFigure skatingWinter Olympics 2026USA Olympic teamFrance Olympic teamUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After sackingMauricio Pochettinoin November 2019 – five months after the club’s first Champions League final, with Spurs sitting 14th in the league and sleepwalking to second place in a weak UCL group – There came a pair of chronic (if cantankerous) title winners: José Mourinho and Antonio Conte. They gave a pragmatist (Nuno Espírito Santo) a Big Six test and moved on when performances instantly stagnated. Then arrived Ange Postecoglou; a staunch tactical ideologue whose principles excited at first before becoming a liability.Thomas Frank, though, seemed like the appointment most reminiscent of Pochettino’s 2014 arrival. Both raised relatively unfancied clubs to prominence and established firm operational bedrocks. Both spoke about the importance of culture as much as on-field Xs and Os. Neither had been tested at a club of this caliber.De Zerbi, Heitinga and Pochettino the leading contenders after Tottenham sack FrankRead moreIt’s worth remembering that Pochettino wasn’t an immediate hit. By the November international window of his first season, Tottenham sat 12th with more losses (five) than wins (four) from his first 11 games. Nonetheless, it’s a stretch that the Argentine clearly remembers with some fondness.“When we arrived, we had the possibility to create something special,” Pochettinotold the High Performance podcastearlier this week. “To build the new stadium, to finish the training ground, and to create the facilities that today is one of the best clubs in the world in terms of facilities. You need the trust of the owner, the trust and the vision of the guy they have, like Daniel (Levy), to create this. And then support, and have the patience with us, because in the beginning, it wasn’t easy.”Pochettino acknowledged that he and his staff had to get “very creative” as there was “not too much money to invest in players” while construction was in process on theTottenham HotspurStadium. During Pochettino’s first winter window, two weeks after Manchester City pried Wilfried Bony from Swansea for £28m to bolster their attacking depth, Tottenham sent £5m to MK Dons to acquire Dele Alli before immediately loaning him back to gain further seasoning.Spurs found stability in time; after losing six of their first 14 league fixtures under Pochettino, they lost just six more times over the ensuing 24 contests. Harry Kane cemented himself as the first-choice striker, Spurs qualified for the Europa League by finishing fifth, and the fanbase’s favorite stretch of the modern era kicked off in earnest.Frank’s tenure should be remembered as an ill-suited appointment at a time when the club couldn’t afford to tolerate mediocrity. These days, patience is a costly virtue. And yet, the Pochettino era Spurs would love to return to is a tale of patience being rewarded.”We lived a moment when I was a really young coach, [coming in] from Southampton, and Daniel really trusted us and gave the confidence and patience for us to provide and show our quality as coaches,” Pochettino said. “There are not too many clubs that can do that.”How the state of affairs has shifted. Tottenham is now among the world’s most fidgety clubs in the pyramid. Their squad is cobbled together from the wishlists of four former coaches. The profile of their next manager (and, with it, their inevitable next sacking) is complicated by the duality of Spurs at present: a team again mired in the bottom-quarter of the table, but safely through to the Champions League round of 16. The next steps for those two jobs require completely different approaches, and who Tottenham picks will be telling.Among those in talksto take over is Roberto De Zerbi, a kindred spirit to Mourinho and Conte who would bring their previous success, albeit with a need to control transfers and a prickly disposition during rough patches. His hire would indicate that the club is still largely focused on European competition. De Zerbi suffered relegation during his sole flirtation with the drop (Benevento, 2017-18). John Heitinga, another reported candidate, is now on the coaching staff and would probably be a caretaker hire until a permanent hire can be made in the summer, when there might be a better set of options. Including … Pochettino.Tottenham’s soaring dreams for Thomas Frank quickly hit the buffers of grim reality | David HytnerRead moreWhile he hasa publicised release clause, there’s little reason to think the US coach would abandon his team mere months before a home World Cup. He won’t want to reveal his post-Cup plans too soon, either – ask Julen Lopeteguihow that works out.But a reunion wouldn’t be without risk. Pochettino’s struggles with PSG and Chelsea were well-documented, and they’re clubs of a standard that Tottenham is desperate to match since opening a world-class arena. His honors list includesmore runners-ups than trophies.Nonetheless, Pochettino appears eager to embrace the challenge. In public appearances, he still refers to Tottenham as “we” – even in the context of playing Chelsea, a team he managed more recently. Last summer, the last time rumors of his return to north London were floated, he ended a press conference by saying it was because Tottenham is “my club.”A decade has seen the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium evolve from a costly project that required strict book-keeping into a high-tension cathedral. Lately, though, it has hosted a brutal football experience.Fans estimatethat of the unlucky 13 matches Frank managed at home, the supporters booed him on nine occasions.Frank joins Graham Potter among managers who built their reputations on the bedrock of perceived overperformers before sullying it with short-lived failures at bigger clubs. And Tottenham stands beyond the point of desperation as they chase the successes of yesteryear.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurPremier LeagueUS sportsMauricio PochettinoUSAfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Brown pants. Black sweater. Arms crossed, one hand to his chin and grey beard. The New Jerseyan looked less like the manager ofReal Sociedad, a club that placed in La Liga’s top six for five straight seasons before last year, than a math professor. That’s what he well might have been, had his life taken only a slightly different turn; he graduated from Columbia University with a degree in applied mathematics, after all.Instead, he was there on Saturday, at the Anoeta Stadium, calmly coaxing his side past Elche, 3-1, pumping a single fist whenLa Realscored, occasionally waving those arms to push his side further upfield. As if Matarazzo’s being there, as if his team taking yet another lead, was all just a matter of course. Just a big-time manager at a big-time club, doing big-time things.Since Matarazzo’s appointment on 20 December,La Realhave won four of six in La Liga, surging from 16th place to eighth. During that unbeaten run, they have drawn with Atlético Madrid and regional rivals Athletic Club, andbeaten Barcelona, who had won 11 in a row going into that match – and totally dominated Sociedad, it should be said. Matarazzo’s men also advanced through two rounds of the Copa del Rey, and defeated Athletic Club again on Wednesday in the first leg of their semi-final. On Saturday, they travel to Real Madrid.Pitch Points: Tottenham’s relegation chances; Could Ronaldo leave Saudi Arabia?Read moreYet for his stunning early success – Real Sociedad have now won as many league matches in Matarazzo’s seven weeks in charge as they did in the 17 rounds before – the presence of the American remains remarkable.Rather awkwardly, after just eight matches, the question can already be asked whether Matarazzo is quietly putting together the most impressive season a US-born coach has ever recorded in Europe.The son of an Italian Napoli fan, Matarazzo tried his luck as a professional in Italy after four years of college soccer at Columbia, where two of his younger brothers played as well – all three of them earning All-Ivy League honors while there. Pellegrino, who goes by Rino, wound up spending a decade in Germany’s lower leagues before becoming a coach. He was Julian Nagelsmann’s roommate during the German federation’s coaching courses and joined the latter on the staff at Hoffenheim. Matarazzo took over as Stuttgart manager in December 2019 and got them promoted back to the Bundesliga right away. After getting sacked in late 2022, he returned to Hoffenheim as manager but lasted only 18 months.Matarazzo had been unemployed for more than a year when he suddenly turned up in San Sebastián, becoming the first American to manage inLa Liga.With an innate intensity and clear tactics that he will not share with the press, the results have come quickly. But Matarazzo has also made himself popular with a studious deference to local culture.“The first day he came in, the first impression was a bit scary: he’s 6ft 2in and frightening,” captain Mikel Oyarzabaltold the Guardian(Matarazzo is actually taller – listed as 6ft 6in). “But he has brought good energy, intensity. We’re on the right path now. He has embraced Donostia,la Real, the Basque Country values from here; coming from the outside, that’s important.”“The team is very, very special,” Matarazzosaid. “I am enjoying this club: the players, the staff. Good characters, great values that I can identify myself with and the city is beautiful too; it’s not a bad place to be right now.”But if the American appreciates his good fortune in getting this opportunity, he has also been savvy in his approach. To make himself understood to a team that counts only a few non-native Spanish speakers, Matarazzo speaks as much Spanish as he can muster. But when he speaks in English, he provides subtitles to his team talks in all the languages in the locker room, according to goalkeeper Álex Remiro.Luck has been a factor, too. “There was a little magic in the atmosphere,” Matarazzo said after his side upset Barça on the eve oftamborrada, San Sebastián’s annual festival.In truth, the distinction of the best American coaching campaign in European club soccer is a niche one. That competition isn’t particularly stiff. Bob Bradley had a checkered record in two stints with Stabæk in Norway, at Le Havre in France, and, very briefly and unhappily, in charge of Swansea City of the Premier League. Gregg Berhalter never got Hammarby promoted to the top-tier Allsvenskan.The bar to clear is probably the one set by Jesse Marsch in winning back-to-back doubles with Red Bull Salzburg in 2019-20 and 2020-21. But then that Salzburg team were stacked – Erling Haaland scored 28 goals for Marsch in the American’s first half season at the club – and in the middle of a run of 10 straight Austrian league titles. Real Sociedad were in disarray when Matarazzo took over, still smarting from losing Martin Zubimendi to Arsenal last summer.There is a lot of season left, of course. While only three points separateLa Realfrom sixth-placed Espanyol, sitting in the final European place, they are also a mere nine points removed from the relegation zone with 15 rounds of games left to go.IfLa Realstay on anything like the trajectory they have been on, however, Matarazzo will lay down a new marker for his countrymen.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.

A biblical storm blew through the Metropolitano, leaving Barcelona in pieces andAtlético Madridcloser to a first Copa del Rey final in 13 years. “I’m not a wizard but I did believe that the team could play like this,” Simeone said at the end of a wild night, yet even he could not have imagined anything quite like this, 45 extraordinary minutes giving his team a 4-0 lead to take to the Camp Nou in three weeks’ time.“This will remain in the memory however the tie ends,” Simeone said, careful to note that this is not over yet. Hansi Flick, meanwhile, vowed that hisBarcelonateam will fight, claimed they had been handed a “great lesson” that might yet be helpful, and outlined a plan for the second leg: 2-0 in each half. But an an own goal from Eric García and three more before half-time here from Ademola Lookman, Antoine Griezmann and Julián Alvarez, did the kind of damage that will be mightily difficult to fix. Barcelona could not begin that task here, a Pau Cubarsí effort ruled out after a seven-minute VAR check the only “goal” of the second half. Indeed, another VAR check made their second leg task even harder when Eric García was sent off in the final minutes.‘His holiness’ Santi Cazorla leads the way as Oviedo find relief … and belief | Sid LoweRead moreEnough had happened in the first half for an entire tie. “There was an incredible energy in the stadium and life is energy,” Simeone said, his side going at Barcelona from the start. The first foul, on 30 seconds, was a fuse lit. Giuliano Simeone flew into Alejandro Balde and his teammates followed, a perfect storm unleashed that Barcelona could not escape. For 45 frantic, breathless minutes in which Flick’s team didn’t know which way to turn, Atlético Madrid ripped into them, leaving no place to take shelter and scoring four goals that genuinely should have been more.It may sound absurd to say that the opening goal was coming when it came on just six minutes, and via an own goal, but that was how it felt here and that feeling never went away. Jules Koundé had already had to move fast to stop Alvarez getting in and Joan García had saved from Giuliano Simeone inside two minutes, Griezmann’s gorgeous cushioned pass into him then just the first brushstroke of what was becoming a masterpiece. And although that opening goal was ridiculous, Eric García’s back pass slipping under Joan García’s foot and over the line, Atlético didn’t stop there.The smell of blood was too strong for that. Atlético streamed into the wide space beyond Barcelona’s high line, screeched into every tackle, first to every ball. Barcelona were caught in the vortex, a nightmare, trapped on the page of a Where’s Wally: everywhere they looked, there was a red and white shirt.On the left, Lookman flew past them. On the right Simeone, a neck-bulging, leg-whirring, heart-thumping Tasmanian devil of a footballer, flew past them. The right-back, Nahuel Molina bombing in from behind, flew past them too. Left-back Matteo Ruggeri resisted the urge to run, and instead successfully denied Lamine Yamal any place to play. Koke and Marcos Llorente, a man with the legs and lungs of 11 men, dominated the middle. Alvarez was … well, Barcelona didn’t knowwherehe was. Griezmann made it all make sense, subtle in the storm, as if conducting it.He also scored the second after just 13 minutes. As if to underline how complete Atlético were, the goal started with goalkeeper Juan Musso delivering a fabulous pass to Lookman on the left. Lookman found Alvarez, who speared ball rightwards. Molina slipped it in to Griezmann to score. Simeone turned to the supporters, demanding they play their part which they did, never falling silent, not even when Fermín López hit the bar soon after. They were the soundtrack, the rolling thunder in a storm which kept on coming.View image in fullscreenEric García (right) is shown a yellow card for fouling Álex Baena, which was later upgraded to a red.Photograph: Óscar del Pozo/AFP/Getty ImagesGriezmann might have taken more time over a chance made by Lookman and Llorente, but only 30 seconds later he and Molina made another clear opportunity for Alvarez which Koundé cleared off the line. Twenty-two minutes in and it was Atlético’s sixth shot, all clear sights of goal. From their seventh, a couple of minutes later, Griezmann struck over. Again, Giuliano Simeone had raced free into space. The next time he flew up the right, Griezmann opening the cage and setting him free again, they scored their third. Lookman provided the finish this time.Flick took off Marc Casadó, pulling him close to offer an explanation. Casadó had been booked for desperately taking down Giuliano who was escaping again and, besides, Barcelona had to do something,anything. But although López got in soon after, Musso saved that and Atlético immediately went back at them, extending a lead that was already barely believable. Ripping Barcelona’s left side open yet again, this time it was Molina who started it, Lookman laying off for Alvarez to hit a perfect finish that was a release too, the ball taking all his troubles with it.Under pressure and out of form of late, Alvarez had needed this. They all had. On the touchline, Simeone Sr set off on a sprint, his head in his hands. Alvarez closed his eyes and pointed skywards, liberated. Koke screamed. All over the place, players ran, roaring. It wasn’t over, the tie not even a quarter done, but it felt that way, the unimaginable suddenly real, faith restored. “The people need a night like this,” Simeone said.Explore more on these topicsCopa del ReyAtlético MadridBarcelonaEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I can understand it with the number of storms they had ... but I did think it affected the football. I thought we were ruthless. The three goals were fantastic. I felt like our defending as a whole team was excellent.”Arsenal take giant stride towards WCL last eight with thumping win over LeuvenRead moreThese two are familiar opponents, having met in Madrid back in October in the league phase. United came out with a 1-0 win on that occasion in an eventful encounter in which both sides were reduced to 10 players.Since then, their fortunes have diverged. Skinner’s side are in strong form that has taken them to second place in the Women’s Super League and to their first League Cup final.For Atlético, things have been less rosy. They have had an inconsistent season in Liga F and they now sit fifth. Poor results led to the replacement of Victor Martín with José Herrera in late January. In the three matches since, the manager has implemented a change to a back three and they earned their first win in seven against Levante last weekend.Herrera named an unchanged lineup from that win. They were without the electric midfielder Luany due to suspension while the new arrivals Priscila Chinchilla and Kathrine Møller Kühl were on the bench.View image in fullscreenElisabeth Terland (right) mimes a haircut in celebration as she savours her early goal with Maya Le Tissier.Photograph: Poppy Townson/MUFC/Manchester United/Getty ImagesIn contrast, Skinner made three changes from Saturday’s victory over Leicester. With three goals in her past four matches, the clinical Terland returned, while Ellen Wangerheim was handed her first Champions League start in a United shirt.Atlético’s Fiamma Benítez had said pre-match that Madrid would need to cut out mistakes but a big error within three minutes put them on the back foot. Vilde Bøe Risa handed her former side a gift with a pass straight to Malard. The France international spotted the run of Terland and the Norwegian duly converted.“You can put two goalkeepers in front of her finish and they wouldn’t have saved it,” Skinner said. “It was that good. Teri is one of the best finishers that I have ever worked with. She worked tirelessly. When she’s in this form, she’s unstoppable.”Quick GuideWolfsburg fight back against JuveShowWolfsburg fight back against JuveSarai Linder scored a last-gasp equaliser asWolfsburgcame from two goals down to draw 2-2 withJuventusin the first leg of the Women's Champions League playoff round at the AOK Stadion.Juventus took the lead after six minutes when Estela Carbonell whipped in a teasing corner and Ana Capeta glanced it into the far corner.

It is a mess of their own making, which started with the exit of their most successful manager in recent history and has the latest P45 going to the man brought in to sort out the problems created by an ill-judged appointment that lasted eight winless games.Nottingham Forest target Vítor Pereira after late-night sacking of Sean DycheRead moreTwelve months ago Forest were battling for a Champions League spot under the stable stewardship of Nuno Espírito Santo. A lot has changed and they will become the first Premier League side to have four permanent managers in a season, which was not a record the club were aiming for in August, when hoping to build on a seventh-place finish, an FA Cup semi-final and qualifying for Europe for the first time in 30 years.Nuno lasted 24 days this season after a breakdown in relations with Marinakis, Ange Postecoglou a disastrous 40 and Sean Dyche a respectable 114. There are items on the shelves of West Bridgford greengrocers that have been around for longer than their combined managerial stints. At least, forVítor Pereira, who is in talks to take over, there are only 101 days until the final match of the campaign.Forest are in a battle for survival, one place and three points above the relegation zone.The goalless draw against Wolves on Wednesday sealed Dyche’s fate, as boos and expletives swirled at full-time with Marinakis watching from the stands. For the second time this season Marinakis took action by parting with a coach within hours of a game finishing.View image in fullscreenSean Dyche’s appointment was a pragmatic necessity after Ange Postecoglou’s flawed reign but his relationship with players and fans became strained.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action/ReutersThe air had turned toxic in the stands, fans frustrated by the football and the inability to beat the worst team in the Premier League, despite Forest having 35 shots. From the first whistle there were groans when a pass did not find its destination or an effort at goal went wayward, with Dyche feeling the brunt of the criticism. The supporters did not warm to him. His brand of football was extremely conservative, but this was to be expected.It was not difficult for the cameras to pick out Marinakis in the stands, the owner having constructed something akin to a throne in the directors’ box. Whenever a chance was missed, the TV coverage turned to the Greek billionaire, who went through a full array of grimaces as his investments toiled.Marinakis holds great affection for his players and when he noted their backing for Dyche was waning, it was always likely he would act because coaches are far more disposable. Nor does Marinakis want a poisonous atmosphere inside the ground; he enjoys the adulation of fans and with an unpopular figure in the dugout, things could not go on.It was similar when Postecoglou was dismissed, having been selected by Marinakis, but the decision to remove Nuno for Postecoglou was a miscalculation. Postecoglou wanted to revolutionise Forest but did not have the means to do so and quickly grated on the players with a style that did not suit those available.He was sent packing within 20 minutes of losing to Chelseaand did not even get to perform his press duties. At least Dyche was given three hours’ grace and a chat with journalists.View image in fullscreenVítor Pereira is poised to take over with Forest only one place and three points above the relegation zone.Photograph: Dan Istitene/Getty ImagesDyche’s appointment was a pragmatic necessity after Postecoglou’s flawed reign. Dyche performed the role he was supposed to, sorting out the defence and bringing order after the chaos. For the period of Dyche’s tenure, Forest were 11th, above Sunderland and Bournemouth, who have European aspirations, and he guided them into the Europa League knockout stages. There was even a nomination for the Premier League manager of the month for January but, with players irritated, things descended quickly.Dyche and his staff had a strained relationship with the squad by the end. His intense methods and growl were not appreciated. Against Wolves everyone was looking for a reaction after last Friday’s 3-1 loss at Leeds, where Forest were appalling. That was their only league defeat in six, and came with three of the regular back five absent. There was greater attacking intent against Wolves but the execution was sloppy and no individuals lived up to expectations, hindered by a lack of confidence.Sean Dyche sacked by Nottingham Forest after Wolves drawRead moreMarinakis remains popular at the City Ground, regularly having his name chanted. No one can question his financial commitment to Forest, who have made 16 signings since the end of last season, at a cost of £180m. Getting the best out of any player requires a stable environment, though, particularly as they have often moved countries, and Forest do not offer that. There, styles and methods change faster than the seasons.A good portion of Marinakis’s recent expenditure has gone on exciting wingers but Dyche was never likely to embrace them, and Forest scored 20 goals in his 18 league games. Omari Hutchinson, Dan Ndoye and Dilane Bakwa were bit-part players under Dyche, who often preferred the disciplined Nicolás Domínguez out wide for his defensive attributes.Four wins in Dyche’s opening seven games brought optimism and began to turn the ship. Liverpool were defeated at Anfield and Tottenham pummelled on the banks of the Trent; the former Brian Clough apprentice had masterminded key victories. But within four months Dyche has gone. His reputation will not be damaged because the Forest job is the most precarious in the Premier League. Pereira is poised to take over but if Forest are relegated neither he nor his three immediate predecessors should shoulder the blame.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestSean DycheanalysisShareReuse this content"

It puts to bed speculation that he could be tempted by a high-profile club vacancy and provides all ­parties with certainty before their tilt at football’s biggest prize begins in June.England to play New Zealand and Costa Rica in final pre-World Cup friendliesRead moreAsked if he thinksEnglandcan deliver in his first major tournament as a national team manager, Tuchel was unequivocal. “Yes, we believe, of course we believe,” he said. “We know how difficult it is and of course some other countries will believe as well, but we believe that we can play a strong role and we will go for it.”Tuchel replaced Gareth ­Southgate in January 2025,his original contract running for 18 months. England won all eight of their World Cup ­qualifiers under his leadership without ­conceding a goal. There had been speculation that Manchester United or Real Madrid, both of whom are seeking long-term solutions in the dugout, could lure him back to club football but that prospect has now been kicked far down the road.“There was no reason to be ­worried because I was obviously totally focused through the qualification period and right after that we started the talks,” he said. “I was always committed to this idea of extending the contract, the FA were always committed. There were no games, no second thoughts. The process was very straightforward.“There is a possibility that I will be tempted to go back to club football but not in the next two-and-a-half years.”View image in fullscreenOne of the biggest decisions in Tuchel’s in-tray is how to handle Jude Bellingham.Photograph: Florion Goga/ReutersThe 52-year-old’s show of commitment removes a potential distraction. “I think it was very important that we didn’t do it just to have clarity and calmness in the World Cup, but it’s a welcome side effect now,” he said. “It’s clear, and ­clarity is always good. We will not get distracted by it. We have a very clear idea what we want from this group, and how we want it.”It is a job that has grown on Tuchel, whose team laboured at times in the first half of last year –losing a home friendly to Senegalin June – before springing into life during the autumn. “I didn’t know exactly what was coming as an international manager,” he said. “It took me some months to understand it but as soon as the more condensed period arrived in September, October, November, it was the period where I felt the strongest connection to the players and to the job itself. And from there on I was fully committed to go even further.”One of the biggest decisions in Tuchel’s in-tray is how to handle Jude Bellingham, who he criticised after a frustrated reaction to being substituted against Albania in November. Bellingham is out with a hamstring injury and may not be back in time for the March friendlies against Uruguay and Japan.“The club is a bit more defensive on the outlook regarding the weeks of his recovery,” he said. “Jude is pushing and, as we know him, he is determined and super-professional. He will try everything to be with us in March. Of course we are in contact, that is a normal thing to do, and we wish him all the best. Whatever we can do for him, we will help and support him. It is a little race against time.”Tuchel’s core support team of Anthony Barry, Henrique Hilário, Nico Mayer and James Melbourne have also signed new contracts to summer 2028. There is no confirmation of a break clause in his deal should England underperform at the World Cup, although the FA chief executive, Mark Bullingham, stated there were performance-related elements. “Every single person has performance conditions in their contract; you wouldn’t expect me to go into those,” he said. “I’ve got them as well, but we’re really clear that we want him coaching us in 2028.”The announcement meant England’s fortunes in the 2026-27 Nations League draw, which took place in Brussels with Tuchel and Bullingham looking on, played second fiddle. They face a quick rematch with Croatia, against whom they open their World Cup campaign on 17 June, with Spain and Czech Republic completing their opponents in Group A3. England were promoted back to League A under the caretaker management of Lee Carsley in 2024. Wales were drawn in group A4 with Portugal, Denmark and Norway.Other British and Irish interest was confined to League B. Scotland were drawn to face Switzerland, Slovenia and North Macedonia in group B1 while Northern Ireland will play Hungary, Ukraine and Georgia in B2. The Republic of Ireland were handed ties with Israel, Austria and Kosovo in group B3. The league phase will be contested between September and November, with the finals in June.Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelnewsShareReuse this content"

Whilst the panel have come to their conclusion, which I have to respect, I do not agree with their decision. There is a place in football for everyone, it’s the greatest sport on the planet.”The FA said it was alleged Brennan “acted in an improper manner and/or used abusive and/or insulting words towards a match official” and that his comments “included a reference – whether express or implied – to gender”.In 2013 the FA introduced a minimum five‑match ban for proven cases of discrimination after theLuis Suárez and Patrice Evra racism case, with the tariff increased to six games in 2019. The minimum sanction applies to offences involving racism, homophobia or any other form of discriminatory language or behaviour. The ban can be increased depending on aggravating factors or reduced if there are strong mitigating factors.Explore more on these topicsBarnetThe FALeague TwonewsShareReuse this content"

The chaos that is in and around that ball is very, very difficult to defend.”Asked whether he was concerned that City have started to cut the gap, he added: “We are going to be preparing to win every single match and the only thing that we can do is focus on that and raise the levels collectively. That’s going to carry on like this until May, regardless if we play before [City] or after them. It’s just the things that we have to do.”Eberechi Eze was substituted at half-time on his first Premier League start for two months and Arteta believes the England forward isstill adapting after signingfrom Crystal Palace in the summer.“It’s not easy when you move to a new club,” he said. “It’s always like this. When you play against a team that is like this and the ball is a lot of times not on the floor and you have to be constantly breaking the play, especially for attacking and creative players, it’s more difficult.”The Brentford manager, Keith Andrews, felt that Arsenal’s Gabriel Magalhães should have been shown a second yellow card for a foul on Dango Ouattara but was delighted with his side as they strengthened their grip on seventh place.“It was a performance filled with grit, personality, character and bravery,” he said. “We had to try and cause a bit of chaos and that’s what we did with our set-pieces and general play.

England have not won at Murrayfield since 2020, however, and only once since 2016 with Russell proving their nemesis on several occasions.Gregor Townsend warns England not to underestimate wounded ScotlandRead moreThe 33-year-old orchestrated the Lions’ series victory over the Wallabies last summer with Wigglesworth one of Andy Farrell’s right-hand men on the coaching staff and he has conceded coming up with a specific plan to stop Russell is a bootless errand.“How many defence coaches have gone in with a Finn Russell plan and been made to look pretty stupid?” said Wigglesworth. “It’s not something we’ve done in that regard, it’s more: how do we stop Scotland and what they can do? Because we know the dangers they have out wide and what the guys in the middle produce for them.“He’s one of those guys whose talent speaks for itself but he works hard on it. I found him really diligent. Obviously his mind works really fast. You tell him something or there’s some part of a plan he just picks up and goes with it. All the stuff you expect with the standard of player he is. He’s always a personable bloke so you can have those chats with him. I probably got to see more of it, up close.”The England flanker Sam Underhill has pointed to Russell’s defensive mettle as well as his attacking attributes, revealing he has thought better of putting one of his trademark tackles on the Scot in Bath training. “He’s far too expensive to do that,” Underhill said. “He’s a physical 10, as well, which is probably an underrated part of his game. He’s a good defender, he’s a good hitter, and he’s not a small guy. I don’t want to big him up too much but he’s a fairly well rounded player.“He’s a very talented rugby player. He’s a very confident player. That’s probably one of his strengths – he’s pretty unflappable. I’ve got a lot of respect for the guy and enjoy playing with him.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026England rugby union teamScotland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The visitors have only won two of the last eight fixtures between the two countries and Townsend wants his players to feed off the feelgood memories of previous English losses.While last weekend’sdeeply disappointing loss to Italyin Rome has generated plenty of external criticism, England have won only once at Murrayfield since 2017. Townsend is expecting his players to bounce back from their Italian setback and says they will be inspired by past successes. “I would hope they don’t fade into irrelevance because our players have evidence that they’ve won in this fixture,” stressed the head coach.Suffocating Scotland key to Borthwick’s plan for England Calcutta Cup success | Robert KitsonRead more“If it adds the extra bit of belief and motivation that we’ve been in this position before and we’ve won then that can only help. It doesn’t always work that that evidence leads to a victory. But we’re going to lean into anything that can help us get a win this weekend.”Scotland have decided, nevertheless, not to recall Duhan van der Merwe, a regular scourge of England in the past, or his fellow British & Irish Lion Blair Kinghorn and have instead kept faith with the back three that started against Italy. There are changes up front, however, where Pierre Schoeman and Grant Gilchrist have been dropped and the injured Ewan Ashman has been replaced at hooker by George Turner. Jamie Ritchie also starts in the back-row with Matt Fagerson moving to the bench.The reshuffle means there is a complete absence of representatives from Edinburgh in the starting XV while Scotland’s only other pro side, Glasgow Warriors, provide 10 players. It is the first time no Edinburgh squad members have featured in a Scotland XV since 1998, but Townsend is hoping the Murrayfield crowd will be more focused on the primary objective of beating England.“It’s our biggest game of the season, it always has been,” said Townsend. “It’s even more important on the back of a defeat, a disappointing defeat. We know our supporters are behind us as they always are and we’ll need their energy at the weekend. The atmosphere at Murrayfield has been very special over the last few years and I’m sure they’re going to the game with huge expectation and hope.”View image in fullscreenScotland endured a miserable start to the Six Nations in Italy.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesLast time Scotland played a tier one nation at home in November, however, they were booed off after squandering a 21-0 point lead in awounding defeat to Argentinaand Townsend is well aware of the noises off. “It’s part of the game. I understand, we’re all sports fans. We understand what happens when you lose, when people open up to criticise you or the team.”A concerted reaction is now going to be required, with England currently on a 12-Test unbeaten run. The away team also happens to included five players – Tom Roebuck, Fin Smith, Fraser Dingwall, Henry Pollock, Bevan Rodd – who could have been eligible for Scotland either through birth or parentage.

But in my experience over the last eight or nine years, when we’ve been too emotional, that’s when we’ve not started well.“There is a mindset, though, and I’d rather put it on to that. Of being physical, being aggressive and showing huge effort. That’s what the jersey demands and we know we have to deliver that this weekend. Our forwards’ display over these last number of games against England has been excellent. We understand the set-piece pressure England put on the opposition and combating that has been at the heart of our successes in this fixture.

The richest man in the world posted about how the white race was under threat, made allusions to race science or promoted anti-immigrant conspiracy content on 26 out of 31 days in January, according to the Guardian’s analysis of his social media output. The posts, made on his platform X, reflect a renewed embrace of what extremism experts describe as white supremacist material.“Whites are a rapidly dying minority,” Musk said on 22 January, a short time before taking the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, while reposting an Irish anti-immigrant influencer’s video about demographic change.Musk’s posts included him repeatedly claiming white people face systemic discrimination, endorsing the conspiracy that there is an ongoing genocide against white people in countries around the world and promoting a claim that white people would be “slaughtered” by non-whites if they become a demographic minority.“If you stripped Elon Musk’s name off of these things and showed them to me, I would think that this was a white supremacist,” said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Extremism, who reviewed a selection of the posts.Epstein engineered intimate relationship for Tesla’s Kimbal Musk, emails showRead moreMusk has for years promoted anti-immigrant and far-right content in his posts, as well asendorsed rightwing activistsandpolitical partiesaround the globe. The Tesla CEO’s most recent output displays a more consistent and explicit engagement with white supremacist content and nativist activists than in the past, however, lending them the imprimatur of the world’s richest person and spreading their ideas to his audience of over 200 million followers. Beirich said he appeared “deep into the world of white nationalism”.“The White ‘liberal’ standard for behavior is extremely strict, but is only applied to Whites,” Musk said on 26 January, commenting on a post that claimed there was discrimination against white conservatives.Musk’s posts repeatedly echoed prominent white supremacist narratives and ideologies, said William Braniff, the former director of the Department of Homeland Security’s office for prevention of terrorism and extremism. Several of Musk’s posts included what Braniff described as “textbook examples” of white supremacist conspiracy theories such as “the great replacement” – a belief that liberal elites or Jewish people are conspiring to use immigration to replace white populations.The danger of Musk’s obsession lies in mainstreaming ideas that are deeply tied to violence and discrimination, according to Braniff, who is now executive director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (Peril) at American University. “The great replacement has been an especially important mobilizing narrative for highly lethal white supremacist attacks in the United States and elsewhere,” he said.Musk has repeatedly denied he is racist or antisemitic, stated that he condemns terrorism and said he does not advocate for violence. He asserted in a 2024 interview with Don Lemon that he does not subscribe to “great replacement theory”. He also told Joe Rogan in March last year that he is not a Nazi, weeks after facing condemnations from Jewish groups and the chairman of the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Israel over his speech to Germany’s far-right AfD party in whichhe told Germansto move beyond their “past guilt”.Musk offers a platform for the far-rightAlthough Musk wrote a number of posts on race and immigration himself last month, much of his output involved reposting far-right activist accounts or replying to them with brief endorsements such as a bullseye emoji, implying agreement. On 10 January, Musk replied “yes” in reply to a post from a white nationalist account that claimed “race communism that destroyed Rhodesia and South Africa are the same things they are bringing to America and the rest of the Occident to turn us into the Global Favela”. The author of the post previously published a blog titled How To Build An American Orania – a reference to theprivately owned, whites-only townof Orania in South Africa.Similar interactions took place throughout the month. After a far-right influencer posted “they just want to eradicate White people it’s that simple” in reference to the New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s inauguration speech, Musk replied on 7 January “some people really do”. On 9 January, he wrote “true” in a quote-tweet of a post that claimed white people would be “slaughtered” as a minority and that “White solidarity is the only way to survive”. On 16 January, Musk reposted a rightwing influencer’s post claiming “white genocide is the official Democrat party platform”. The same day, he promoted another rightwing influencer’s anti-diversity post that used an AI-generated image of tattooed black women on Yale’s rowing team.While some of the accounts Musk interacted with are fringe social media influencers, several others are prominent far-right activists whose extremist views have been well-documented. On 17 January, Musk reposted a screed against “ethno-cultural upheaval” in Europe from Martin Sellner, far-right Austrian activist, who is the founder of the ethno-nationalist Identitarian Movement. Musk, whoreinstated Sellner’s banned X account in 2024, replied to the anti-immigration post that “this is simply a statement of fact”.“Martin Sellner is probably the most significant global white supremacist right now,” Beirich said. “He’s the one who pushed the great replacement, and has now pushed the idea of remigration – ethnically cleansing western countries of non-whites.”Sellner gavea presentation in 2024 at an event in Germanyon the logistics of carrying out mass deportations that was attended by neo-Nazis and other extremists. The event sparked immense backlash andprotests against the far-rightacross the northern European nation. Lawmakers attempted to ban him from the country. The Austrian activist alsoreceived a €1,500 donation from and communicated with white supremacist Brenton Tarrant, who would later go on to commit a terrorist attack in 2019 that killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.Sellner rejected being described as a white supremacist and said he respects “the dignity of all others” in a statement to the Guardian, while taking credit for politically mainstreaming the concepts of the great replacement and remigration. “Now, from Trump to Musk, everyone is talking about replacement migration, the ethnic vote and remigration,” Sellner said. He additionally claimed that the Potsdam event was “misrepresented” by media and that he rejected any form of terrorism. Sellner described his interactions with Tarrant, which includedoffering to get a drinkwith Tarrantif he ever visited Austria, as limited to standard thank-you emails to a donor.Extremism experts said the ideas Musk has publicized are deeply tied to some of the most notorious, violent extremist attacks of the past decade, including the 2018 antisemitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and the 2022 racist mass killing of 10 people at a Buffalo supermarket. The shooter in Buffaloleft a 180-page manifestofilled with mentions of white supremacist replacement theory.Musk’s posts also reflect an increasing embrace of white supremacist figures and talking points among prominent Republicans and government agencies in the past year. Some of that shift has played out on X, where Musk reinstated a number of formerly banned accounts such as prominent antisemite Nick Fuentes. Federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security have meanwhileposted contentthat aligns with white supremacist propaganda. Earlier this month, Donald Trump also drew widespread backlashafter posting a racist videoto his Truth Social platform that depicted Barack and Michelle Obama as apes.Musk has repeatedly mocked those who have criticized his comments as far-right or racist, framing his views as common sense or simply reiterating facts and statistics. His rhetoric reflects a widespread tactic among people on the far-right, experts say, when extremists attempt to defend their worldview of an in-group of white people against everyone else.“That reductionist worldview breaks down when people in your in-group say you’re full of it, that what you’re saying is wrong,” Braniff said. “So now the main requirement is to attack the dissenting in-group, to delegitimize them as race traitors and as woke.”As February began, Musk was still posting about race and immigration on a consistent basis. He replied to an anti-immigrant activist this week who claimed that Ireland’s civilization would end “because Irish men are afraid of being called racist and upsetting people from the 3rd world”.“Such men are pathetic traitors,” Musk responded.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskRaceXnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.However, even squeezing in “brisk walks” can be a chore, with busy schedules and increasingly desk-bound jobs forcing more of us to remain sedentary for long periods. That is where walking pads come in, being lighter, smaller and often easier to store than bulky and tricky-to-manoeuvre running treadmills.When coupled with a standing desk, walking pads can be used while working – or when watching TV in the evening. Just a couple of 30-minute sessions add thousands of steps to your daily tally. In fact, a 60-minute walk at an easy 3km an hour can burn between 200 and 300 additional calories, helping those who want to improve their fitness and tone up without the sweatiness and inconvenience of a full-on treadmill session.Walking pads are often cheaper than full-size treadmills, simple to use and relatively easy to store, and they’re perfect for adding more movement to your life without having to give up the day job.At a glanceBest walking pad overallJTX MoveLightRead more£499Buy at JTX FitnessBest budget walking pad and best for beginnersUrevo Strol 2ERead more£239.99Buy at AmazonBest foldable walking padBodyMax WP60Read more£549Buy at AmazonBest walking pad for inclineMobvoi Home Treadmill PlusRead more£179.99Buy at MobvoiWhy you should trust meI’m a keen fitness fan who does everything from gym-based strength training and kickboxing classes to outdoor trail runs and cold-water surfing. As a result, I’ve often been tasked with testing fitness technology for industry magazines.I’ve always been one to get stuck in, whatever I’m testing, whether that means surfing in the latest smartwatch or feeling the burn to test a set of connected kettlebells.I’m a strong believer that you need to live with new-fangled tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I’ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the right environment. With walking pads, that meant strolling along, racking up the steps and burning calories – even while I wrote up this feature.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach walking pad was shoehorned into daily life for at least three days of testing.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianThere was only one way to properly trial the five walking treadmills we selected for this test, and that’s to mimic the customer journey by ordering, taking delivery, unboxing, setting them up and then shoehorning them into daily life.The best walking treadmills – or walking pads – aren’t quite as bulky asregular running treadmills, so I could have multiple models on the go at home at once: one under my desk, one in front of the television and one in my wife’s office upstairs, rotating through them to ensure the same time – at least three days – was spent on each.The testing process meant a lot of additional steps and – in some cases at least – a whining soundtrack that drowned out whatever Netflix series the family was attempting to enjoy. Besides general observations on the heft, ease of storage, quietness, ease of operation and build quality, I tested any additional features available, such as incline, speed adjustments and any remote controls or apps.To get a good idea of energy consumption and the overall cost of running a walking treadmill, I plugged each unit into a power meter, which offered real-time readouts on energy use, and calculated the cost based on my energy tariff.Here are the four best walking pads you can buy now.The best walking pads and under-desk treadmills in 2026View image in fullscreen‘It feels like a walking pad that will go the distance’: the JTX MoveLight.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianBest walking pad overall:JTX MoveLightJTXMoveLight£499£499 at JTX FitnessWhat we loveGreat build quality and crisp displayWhat we don’t loveIt’s heavy and awkward to move aroundPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£499 at JTX FitnessJTX tends to appear in the “best value” section of most reviews of home fitness equipment. The brand is known for offering affordability and reliable build quality, but lacks eye candy and technological flourishes.The MoveLight walking pad is different, though. It happens to be one of the most expensive walking pads we tested. At almost 30kg, it’s also one of the heaviest.That’s no bad thing, though: there’s a tangible difference in the build quality when compared with cheaper walking pads. The JTX also offers a sizeable display, cushioned walking deck and quiet 1hp electric motor. It’s a solid treadmill offering speeds of up to 6km/h, meaning it’s possible to use it for slow jogging without the worry of it falling apart.Why we love itThe MoveLight is similar in design to the BodyMax reviewed below and has a solid plastic chassis that gives it a more premium feel than its cheaper rivals. There’s also a generous running deck area.The extra-large LED console is easy to use and neatly scrolls through speed, time and step count information as you walk. The shrill beeps upon startup and when you adjust the speed do become tiresome, though. Any office mates will want to throw a pencil at you.A small plastic remote allows you to adjust the speed, stop or start the unit and scroll the display between distance, calories and time on one half, and speed and step count on the other.The 1hp motor is powerful enough to propel the deck up to 6km/h, where it remains much quieter than some of the others tested. The deck cushioning is also tangible underfoot, offering a nice spring that makes longer walking sessions more comfortable.Overall, it feels like a walking pad that will go the distance – and so it should, given the price – but that solid build also makes it a pain to move around the house, with the overall weight requiring serious muscle to tip it up on to its wheels. It also doesn’t fold like the similarly priced BodyMax machine.Oh, and one final public service announcement: those with wooden floors will want to take care that the wheels and plastic feet don’t scratch the surface during transport.During testing, we found it to be slightly more power-hungry than rivals, supping about 100W at 3.5km/h, meaning it costs about 3p an hour to power – or about 90p a month if used for an hour each day.It’s a shame that …it’s so big and heavy to move around, which makes storing it after each session a chore.Size:147 x 60 x 12.5cm (LWH)Weight:29.5kgWalking deck size:45 x 122cmMaximum user weight:100kgIncline:noneMaximum speed:6km/hFolding:noJTXMoveLight£499£499 at JTX FitnessWhat we loveGreat build quality and crisp displayWhat we don’t loveIt’s heavy and awkward to move aroundBest budget walking pad and best for beginners:Urevo Strol 2EUrevoStrol 2E£239.99£239.99 at AmazonWhat we loveEasy to move around and store when not in useWhat we don’t loveA short belt that’s not suitable for for taller usersPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£239.99 at AmazonIt’s difficult to separate the Strol 2E from the Mobvoi below, with both opting for a slimline, folding handle design that allows them to transform from simple under-desk walking pads to more traditional running treadmills.Built of sturdier stuff than its doppelganger, the Strol also brings an impressive digital offering into the mix with the Urevo smartphone and tablet app. This provides free virtual walks and collates daily, weekly and monthly workout information.With an impressively quiet and powerful 2.25hp electric motor and plenty of shock absorption underfoot, it’s a great way to rack up additional steps during the day, whether from speedier walking sessions or even light jogs.Why we love itAside from representing excellent value for money, the Strol 2E is smaller, easier to store and less of a task to move around the house than some of its counterparts. Its slim profile means it will slip under a sofa or bed when not in use.The downside of this is a small walking deck, which is particularly lacking in length. This makes it easy to run out of room if you have longer legs, and makes faster running sessions particularly awkward for anyone taller than 5ft. Urevo opts for a folding handle that flips up in running mode. This includes a magnetic safety catch that clips to your clothes and automatically shuts off the unit if you inadvertently run out of deck space.Aside from the quiet operation, well-cushioned walking surface and low power consumption, the Strol 2E is also one of the most technologically accomplished walking pads on this list. The free-to-download app offers virtual walks and allows you to set workouts based on time, step and calorie goals. You can control the speed of the treadmill from your phone or tablet, or use a slick remote control that can also turn off the annoying beeps at the press of a button.It comes with a plastic device holder that can be clipped on to the safety handle for bingeing Netflix or enjoying one of those scenic virtual tours – although you’ll need headphones because there’s no built-in speaker. For the price, it’s an accomplished package and excellent value for money.It’s a shame that …the belt is so short, making it awkward to run on. Taller users will probably find the walking deck too small for longer strides, too.Size:122 x 57 x 99cm (LWH)Weight:21.4kgWalking deck size:38 x 102cmMaximum user weight:120kgIncline:noneMaximum speed:10km/hFolding:yes – safety handle for runningUrevoStrol 2E£239.99£239.99 at AmazonWhat we loveEasy to move around and store when not in useWhat we don’t loveA short belt that’s not suitable for for taller usersPrefer to sit while you work?

It’s the only model that genuinely folds in half, making it easier to squeeze into a cupboard or wardrobe.However, weighing the best part of 30kg, it’s not the easiest to move, despite wheels at the front that allow it to be tipped on its end and rolled around.Potential portability issues aside, this machine offers a fantastic walking experience, with a neat, bright and easy-to-read LED panel that gives clear and scrolling readouts of workout time, distance, speed and average calorie burn.Very much the Porsche of the walking pad world, the BodyMax unit combines stylish looks and powerful performance – but it does require deep pockets.Why we love itAs with most walking pads tested here, it comes with a small remote control to adjust the speed, but there’s also a clever automatic mode – or A Mode – that senses the foot placement and automatically adjusts the speed.Remain in the middle of the deck, and the walking pad will keep the same pace; walk towards the front, and it speeds up; hang back, and it slows things down. This is a really handy feature, meaning you won’t be constantly distracted by irksome remote-control fiddling.The deck itself is nicely cushioned, and the motor is among the quietest on test. It feels like BodyMax hasn’t scrimped on materials, nor has it been distracted by Bluetooth speakers and other gimmicks, which can’t be said for all.Those wanting their walking pad to double up as a running treadmill may be disappointed: the WP60 tops out at 6km/h, which is a very fast walking pace but a slow jog for most. Not a single walking pad I’ve tested has done a convincing job as a running treadmill, though, being either too flimsy underfoot, too noisy or simply not built to withstand the endless thumping of a sprint session.If you’re seeking robust build quality, the BodyMax WP60 walking pad is well worth the additional outlay. As it folds in half, it can be tucked under a desk or rested against a wall when not in use.It’s a shame that …it’s heavy and awkward to move around when folded, and it’s expensive.Size:143 x 55 x 13cm (LWH)Weight:28kgWalking deck size:42 x 120cmMaximum user weight:100kgIncline:noneMaximum speed:6km/hFolding:yes, folds in half for storageBodyMaxWP60£549£549 at AmazonWhat we loveA cushioned deck makes light jogging a breezeWhat we don’t loveIt’s very heavy and a lot more expensive compared with rivalsBest walking pad for incline:Mobvoi Home Treadmill PlusMobvoiHome Treadmill Plus£179.99£179.99 at MobvoiWhat we loveThe extending handrail is a nice safety additionWhat we don’t loveThe minimal incline isn’t worth the extra expensePhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£179.99 at MobvoiMobvoi is best known for itsTicWatchline of fitness-tracking smartwatches and good-valuewireless headphones, but it also offers a small range of domestic treadmills in the UK.One of the most versatile is the Home Treadmill Plus. This pad offers a slightly larger walking deck area than the brand’sHome Treadmill SE, as well as the ability to add a small amount of incline thanks to flip-out feet for height.The build quality is good for the price, and the setup process is painless, while a decent spread of speeds and the ability to transform it into a more traditional running machine (with a folding handrail) make it a versatile choice for home users.Why we love itMobvoi manages to make its Home Treadmill Plus feel relatively premium and well built without sending the price soaring.It’s ready to use out of the box (although that box is heavy, so get someone to help), with wheels at one end to make it easier to move around the home – especially if you have hard floors. You wouldn’t want to keep lugging it up and down the stairs, though.When “folded” into walking mode, the built-in handrail lies flat, allowing you to slide it under a standing desk. From here, you control it with a small remote control to adjust the speed and turn the machine on and off.It doesn’t fold in half for storage, but the slim side profile means it will slide under a sofa or bed, so long as you have 12cm or more of clearance.It includes a safety mechanism for running that clips to your clothes and attaches to a specific point on the machine with a strong magnet, as you’d get on a gym running machine. There’s no way of safely attaching it when the handrail is tucked away in walking mode, however, so it will continue to operate even if you step off it. Most walking pads are the same, but it always strikes me as a bit dangerous.When extending the handrail and pushing the 2.5hp electric motor to its 12km/h top speed, however, that emergency cord could well come in handy. While it’s nice that it reaches a running pace that’s so fast – feeling like a sprint for many – it’s not really designed for long and arduous sprint sessions. The running deck isn’t big enough, and there isn’t much in the way of shock absorption. I tried running on a couple of occasions but always found the experience a tad claustrophobic, not to mention noisy and generally a bit flimsy-feeling underfoot – particularly when maxing out the speed.The pad does offer an efficient and quiet way of racking up the step count while engaging in side tasks. The fold-out incline legs are a nice touch because adding a small incline helps burn more calories and work different leg muscles.In terms of efficiency, I found it drew around 80W of power at a sedate 3.5km/h speed, meaning it will cost a couple of pence to run for an hour a day on most common tariffs.Other niceties include Bluetooth functionality, allowing it to pair with virtual workout software such asZwift, while a built-in speaker allows music to be streamed from a smartphone. That said, the speaker isn’t great – you’d be far better off with a good pair ofheadphonesinstead.It’s a shame that …it’s heavy to move around, the remote is hit-and-miss, and the legs add only a tiny bit of incline.Size:138cm x 64cm x 12cm (113cm in running mode) (LWH)Weight:24.6kgWalking deck size: 42 x 102cmMaximum user weight:120kgIncline:six degreesMaximum speed:12km/hFolding:yes – safety handle for runningMobvoiHome Treadmill Plus£179.99£179.99 at MobvoiWhat we loveThe extending handrail is a nice safety additionWhat we don’t loveThe minimal incline isn’t worth the extra expenseWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenUsing a walking pad for an hour each day should only add about £10 a year to your energy bills.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianHow much should I spend?Prices vary when it comes to walking pads, with the most affordable costing about £100. Anything less than that is unlikely to last until the end of the month. From my testing, the sweet spot seems to be about £250, where you can get a good blend of value and decent build quality. Some of the best we tested were, predictably, among the most expensive. These high-end models typically cost about £500.How much room do you need?If you’ve got good clearance underneath a bed or sofa, most walking pads will happily slide underneath without the need to fold them up. Imagine a slimmed-down treadmill without the safety handle, and you’re basically there.Models like those from BodyMax fold in half, which drastically reduces the length (or height, depending on how you store it), making it much easier to slide into more compact spaces such as a cupboard or wardrobe. But bear in mind the overall weight – many weigh up to 30kg, so they can be tricky to move without help.How easy is it to maintain a walking pad?Most walking pads come with a small bottle of silicone oil provided. This is used to lubricate the underside of the rubber deck every couple of months to ensure smooth movement. Most manufacturers also supply the required hex key so you can tighten the belt if it’s slipping or has moved slightly off-centre.Quickly check the deck alignment and any moving parts every couple of months, and it should be enough to keep a walking pad running smoothly for years.Do walking pads use a lot of electricity?Walking pads use much less powerful motors than their running treadmill counterparts, and they often do away with power-sapping incline motors and connected Bluetooth features that can see electricity bills spiral.During testing, most walking pads drew between 70 and 100W at a relatively standard 3km/h walking pace. This figure increased slightly as the speed increased.Using a walking pad for an hour each day at those sorts of figures equates to about 2-3p a day – or about £10 a year. Much cheaper than a gym membership, but more costly than getting out in nature.Can I run on a walking pad?Some walking pad speeds are capped at about 6km/h, which makes running on them tricky. A plodding jog is a better description.Some walking pads we tested did reach much higher speeds, but most came with a folding safety handle that extends to allow them to safely reach those speeds, giving the runner something to hang on to should the worst happen. These also came with a separate safety system: a small magnetic tag that attaches to clothing. If this becomes detached, the machine shuts off.The general build and robustness of walking pads aren’t up there with their running-focused counterparts, though. That means they can be noisy, shift around underfoot and generally feel a bit flimsy during faster and longer runs. On top of this, those without handles don’t have the automatic shut-off functionality either, which can make them more dangerous, particularly when using them at higher speeds.In summary,running treadmillsare better suited to those wanting to move at higher speeds. They feature more underfoot cushioning or built-in suspension systems, which make longer, faster sessions more comfortable and easier on the joints.What are the weight capacities of walking pads?The weight capacity, often expressed as max user weight, of a walking pad varies, with the larger, more expensive units typically able to shoulder more weight. We found that most walking pads average about a 90kg maximum weight capacity, but this figure can increase to about 120kg in some models, such as the Urevo Strol 2E. It is best to check the manufacturer specification before buying.What safety features do walking pads use?As with most modern treadmills, many walking pads feature a magnetic safety key that attaches to the unit, while the other end is clipped to the user’s clothing. If the magnetic key is removed due to a fall or exiting the walking pad, the unit will automatically shut off. In addition, many walking pads will use a non-slip belt for improved traction underfoot, and some will even use a folding handrail that can be erected when using the walking pad at higher speeds, such as during jogging workouts or faster walks.Walking pads vs treadmillsThe clue is in the name here, as the smaller and generally more portable walking pad is predominantly designed for walking, or very light jogging at most. The decks and general build aren’t robust enough for running or faster sprint work. As a result, the max speed is typically limited to around 6-10km/h, rather than the 20km/h achievable on some domestic treadmills. Walking pads will also have fewer features, lacking things like built-in programs, incline/decline and modern touchscreens for on-demand classes.For more:The best exercise bikes – testedThe best running watches to hit your fitness goalsThe best cross trainersLeon Poultney has been traversing the worlds of consumer technology and automotive for some of the biggest lifestyle websites and magazines for longer than he cares to divulge.

On her screen is yet another abusive message from her stalker – a man she had met nine months earlier at her church.He had asked Adeboye out; when she declined, he began sending her intimidating, insulting and blackmailing messages on social media, as well as spreading false information about her online. There were even death threats.The experience is taking its toll on her mental health, leaving her struggling to cope. Family and friends she confided in did not take it seriously, and she cannot afford in-person therapy or counselling. As the feeling of panic rose at the sight of his words, she turns to an alternative: a WhatsApp chatbot called Chat Kemi.“Good evening, Resilient Joy,” the bot types. “How are you today?”Adeboye hesitates, then starts typing: “Someone is defaming me online and threatening to kill me, because I refused to date him. I am depressed and confused. What should I do?”The chatbot, which Adeboye had heard about at an event on gender-based violence run by an NGO, advises her to deactivate her social media accounts and provide all necessary information about the person making the threats to someone she trusts.For the first time in months, Adeboye says, she felt less alone.Therapy was often too expensive and there weren’t enough professionals to meet the demandMoses Aiyenuro, BlueroomcareAI platforms offering first-line mental health support have proliferated over the past year,withearly trialsin the US showingmixed results. In Nigeria, whereAI has been embracedin many sectors and industries, a growing number of people turn to chatbots for virtual therapy.Nigeria’s health system, including its mental health provision, has long been underfunded. Between 2015 and 2025, Nigeria has consistently spent less than5% of its budget to healthcare, with 4.2% allocated for 2026, far less than the 15% target that African Union member states agreed to as part of the2001 Abuja Declaration. It is not known how many people in Nigeria live with mental health conditions but, withonly 262 psychiatristsin a country of 240 million people, most do not get adequate treatment.The shortages have beenexacerbated by the Trump administration dismantling USAID, which hasbadly hit servicesin Nigeria, especially at the primary level, having adevastating effect on patientsin communities already struggling with HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and other health challenges. More than90% of Nigerians have no health insurance, and now face uncertainty over access to services and feelings of helplessness over rising costs.Private healthcare is expensive; one therapy session can cost between 50,000 naira (£27) – the equivalent of a week’s worth of groceries. Cultural stigma remains strong; many Nigerians still associate mental illness with spiritual weakness or witchcraft.Commercial and nonprofit AI initiatives are starting to fill this vacuum.HerSafeSpaceis an organisation that offers free and instant legal and emotional assistance to victims of technology-facilitated gender-based violence in five west and central African countries. Its Chat Kemi service is available in local and international languages.View image in fullscreenYouth advocates and community leaders at a workshop on gender-based violence led by the nonprofit group HerSafeSpace, which also offers a free chatbot service.Photograph: HerSafeSpace“These services don’t replace therapy,” says its founder, Abideen Olasupo. Instead, the chatbot uses a referral system to direct users and specific cases to mental health, legal or psychosocial professionals or organisations, should the need arise.“Our major objective is to support young girls, who are particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence, especially online,” he says.Other platforms in Nigeria offering similar services includeFriendnPal, whose AI chatbot provides emotional support, matches patients with licensed therapists and includes mood tracking, psycho-education andASMR toolsto alleviate stress and anxiety.I could finally say things I couldn’t share with my family. That alone gave me reliefOluwakemi OluwakayodeIts pay-as-you-go model gives users instant access to tailored therapy sessions that can include homework or assessments, according to Esther Eruchie, who created the service in response to the loss of her mother after years of depression caused by her 20-year-old brother’s death.Another platform,Blueroomcare, connects clients with licensed therapists through video, voice, text and in-app messaging. It offers in-person outpatient and virtual care at partner clinics nationwide, includes a free wellness assessment, and charges between 5,000 and 51,000 naira for a therapist subscription plan.“Therapy was often too expensive, and there weren’t enough professionals to meet the demand,” says Moses Aiyenuro, who founded Blueroomcare after his own struggles with depression. “I wanted to build a platform that lowers the barriers to care.”The technology used by these apps follows scripts written by licensed Nigerian psychologists and therapists who deliver care to users.In Lagos, Oluwakemi Oluwakayode, a mother of four, started using FriendnPal’s chatbot after watching her eight-year-old daughter endure frequent seizures due to cerebral palsy.They can be useful for coping, but they cannot replace the depth or judgment of professional careDr Nihinlola Olowe“Sometimes, it gave very standard replies,” she admits. “But I could finally say things I couldn’t share with my family. That alone gave me relief.”Later, the app connected her with a licensed therapist – something she says she would never have considered without AI easing her into it.Dr Joy Aifuobhokhan, a Lagos-based public health doctor, says these platforms’ advantage is that they are more affordable and efficient than conventional therapy. “Digital platforms save time otherwise spent preparing, commuting and waiting [to be seen] at physical consultation centres,” she says.But some experts caution that AI cannot provide the same level of expertise as a qualified therapist. “These platforms borrow from clinical methods like CBT [cognitive behavioural therapy] and mindfulness,” says Dr Nihinlola Olowe, a psychologist at Live Still Counselling Services, a Nigerian-based mental health practice.“They can be useful for coping, but they cannot replace the depth or judgment of professional care.”View image in fullscreenBlueroomcare’s therapy app aims to ‘lower the barriers to care’ by offering easy, affordable and private access to professional counselling.Photograph: Blueroomcare/XEruchie says FriendnPal has run more than 10,000 sessions in the past year, while Olasupo says HerSafeSpace has 1,600 users across three continents. Blueroomcare declined to say how many users it had.But measuring the impact based on numbers alone is a challenge. “The real story lies in the engagement,” says Olasupo. “It’s exciting to see that users aren’t just using the app and leaving – they’re coming back again and again.”For many patients, the immediacy and anonymity of a chatbot is key to its appeal but the ease of digital care could come at the cost of privacy. Avril Eyewu-Edero, a cybersecurity expert, believes that without introducing strong database protections in Nigeria, sensitive information – such as medical histories – becomes vulnerable the moment it enters an AI system.“If startups fail to prioritise privacy and encryption from the outset, adoption will stall. Nigerians are eager but wary,” she says.Robots can’t interpret emotion as humans do. For people in crisis … human contact is crucialDr Alero RobertsFounders of the services acknowledge these uncertainties, often highlighting their use of end-to-end encryption, unique codes that identify users or devices without including personally identifiable information, and strict non-sharing policies – even with government authorities, unless compelled by a court order.Now, medical professionals are calling on the Nigerian government to develop enforceable national standards for AI. Dr Alero Roberts, a public health consultant and lecturer at the University of Lagos’s medical college, says: “AI chatbots for mental health are an innovative solution, but without robust regulation, we are venturing blindly into potentially dangerous territory.“Robots can’t interpret human emotion as humans do. For people in crisis, like suicidal thoughts or psychosis, human contact is crucial. Someone, even a non-professional, can recognise the need for urgent intervention,” she says. “This is often lost with AI; strong governance is essential.”A snakebite death is the latest high-profile tragedy in Nigeria: they all connect to map a system in collapse | Cheta NwanzeRead moreUnlike medicines or hospitals, AI mental health platforms operate in a regulatory grey zone.

It’s got a name –the “Claude crash”, referencing the plug-in legal products added by the AI firm Anthropic to its Claude Cowork office assistant.This launch, or so you would think from thepanicked stock market reactionin the past few weeks, marks the moment when the AI revolution rips chunks out of some of the UK’s biggest public companies – those in the dull but successful “data” game, including Relx, the London Stock Exchange Group, Experian, Sage and Informa.Relx, the former Reed Elsevier, whose brands include the Lancet and LexisNexis, is the most intriguing in that list. The company’s description of itself contains at least five words to provoke a yawn – “a global provider of information-based analytics and decision tools for professional and business customers” – but the pre-Claude share price was a thing of wonder. It was £5 in 2012 and £41 in May last year, at which point Relx was worth £70bn-ish and was the fifth-largest company in the FTSE 100 index.And now? The shares have halved from their highs and the biggest falls have come since Claude’s supposedly terror-inducing plug-ins appeared. The market has flipped from seeing Relx as an AI winner – because it is using AI to boost existing products – to fearing its beautiful 34% profit margin will implode.What does the company itself think? Well, Thursday’s full-year results were not titled “the stock market’s gone mad”, because that’s not Relx’s style. But the numbers and statement oozed confidence: revenues up 7% to £9.6bn and operating profits up 9% to £3.3bn; a forecast of “another year of strong growth in 2026”; a dividend raised 7%; and a bigger share buyback of £2.25bn.Chief executive Erik Engström also offered a coherent argument for why the evolution of AI would “remain a key driver of customer value and growth in our business for many years to come”.Short version: AI tools are not new; the recent launches that have caused the fuss are “workflow” products for storing, sorting and reviewing documents for specific projects; Relx mostly fishes in the smaller market for must-have information that is comprehensive and can be relied upon in court.Some of Relx’s data may be public, some may have been public in the past but no longer is so; some is hard to find; some is licensed; some is proprietary; it all comes with “judgments, inferences and interpretations gathered over decades” that are useful to scientists, lawyers, insurance and City professionals and risk assessors; and AI may assist in that value-adding process, or just make the stuff easier for customers to use.His other big point is that Relx is free to do limited licensing deals with AI companies if it wishes, and can continue to launch its own “workflow” products, but it is never going to surrender its impossible-to-replicate proprietary information because that’s where the value in its business lies.It was good for a 2% bounce in the share price, which is better than nothing, but still suggests market worries about where the AI evolution goes next, and whether Relx’s “competitive moat”, as the analysts say, is as deep as advertised. The issue, in part, is fear of the unknown.But Relx’s tactical response should be obvious. If it thinks growth can be relied upon “for many years to come”, as Engström says, and, if the shares are available at half the price of a year ago, just keep the buybacks rolling.This year’s £2.25bn version, up from £1.5bn, equates to 6% of the entire equity base. If it keeps up that pace for a few years, it will get a serious boost to earnings per share – assuming, of course, that the projections for the business itself really are solid.Bigger buybacks, reportedly, are also the activist investor Elliott Management’s prescription at LSEG, where the AI worries and counter-arguments are similar. If you are truly confident, it is the right thing to do.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Nils Pratley on financeLondon Stock ExchangeSharesTechnology sectorInvestingFinancial sectorcommentShareReuse this content"

Inside the calming Pokémon game that ditches battles for gardeningWe explore the cosy world-building spin-off with Game Freak’s Shigeru Ohmori and his fellow developers – and learn how it began with a Pokémon-hunting dreamTom ReganThu 12 Feb 2026 08.35 ESTLast modified on Thu 12 Feb 2026 11.25 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GooglePokémon iscelebrating its 30thanniversary this month, and everybody knows what to expect from these games by now. The concept is simple: head into a cartoonish paradise full of whimsical creatures, capture them in red-and-white balls and assemble a team of warriors from them, before battling other aspiringPokémonmasters. But the latest entry in the series is different – a game that’s more about building than battling.In Pokopia, a refreshingly pacific twist on the series, players are dropped into a virtual world wherePokémonare freed from their spherical prisons and happily roam their natural habitats. There’s one minor caveat – you have to create those habitats by hand, building them from what you can find.Taking its cues from Nintendo’s all-conqueringAnimal Crossing, this Switch 2 game sees you rebuilding decaying habitats in order to attract new Pokémon to move into your sanctuary. (Players of the Xbox classic Viva Piñata, rejoice.) It’s a welcome departure from the main series’ long-running training and battling loop. Veteran Pokémon developer Shigeru Ohmori, who started thinking about Pokopia’s concept while working on 2022’s Pokémon gamesScarlet and Violet, says that the idea for Pokopia arose after spending many years dreaming about finding Pokémon in tall grass.View image in fullscreen‘A very universal cuteness.’Photograph: Nintendo“The first Pokémon game I worked on was [2003’s] Ruby and Sapphire,” recalls Ohmori with a smile. “My first project for that game was to create the map – and whenever I put grass on to the map, Pokémon appeared on screen. That feeling of Pokémon appearing when creating the habitat, and then meeting those Pokémon, was something that I really cherished.” He created a basic prototype for Pokopia in his spare time, and then Pokémon’s developers Game Freak brought on Dragon Quest Builders 2 studio Omega Force to help.This feeling is lovingly recreated for players in Pokopia. As you create tufts of grass, a Bulbasaur suddenly appears, shuffling his way towards you to say hello. There are no humans to be found anywhere in this virtual utopia. In the strange and initially desolate patch in which you create your Pokémon paradise, you control the adorably wobbling mass of everyone’s favourite shape-shifting jelly, Ditto. Haunted by memories of its former trainer, Ditto decides to take a humanoid shape that you determine in a character creation screen. This is your uncanny-looking avatar, doing its best to approximate a faded memory of a human being.After you’ve customised your Ditto/human-hybrid, you are greeted by a sentient shrub, Professor Tangrowth, complete with a data disc attached to his curly tendrils and a pair of glasses strapped to his chin. The prof informs you that it’s your job to restore this barren land. Where do you begin? In exactly the same way that Ohmori did, all those years ago – by making lush, green grass.View image in fullscreenGrow your own in Pokopia.Photograph: Game Freak/The Pokémon Company/Koei TecmoIn order to create new habitats, Ditto borrows moves from each new creature you meet, mimicking their abilities so that you can till the land. Bulbasaur’s ability transforms Ditto’s appendages into floppy, leaf-producing vines. Squirtle’s water gun sees Ditto puke water like a derpy Roman fountain, and Scyther’s cut blesses Ditto with comically oversized razor-sharp blades for arms. In a nice touch, whenever Ditto learns a new move you’re treated to the classic Pokémon level-up music.For an hour I wander the barren wasteland, working to turn sand into grass and hacking trees for wood. Everything feels effortlessly charming, with a level of care and polish that elevates Pokopia’s opening 60 minutes above the series’ many middling spin-offs. Like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Pokopia also allows you to visit friends’ islands and meet their Poké pals, surfing between lands as a Ditto-Lapras or soaring through the skies in the form of a Dragonite.Marina Ayano, the game’s art director, tells me that she grew up with the franchise – making this something of a dream project. During development, Ayano and the sound director landed on two key words to steer the game’s cutesy and laid-back vibe: “chill and pop”. “Chill is slow and cosy, and pop ensures that everything is colourful … [we wanted] a very universal cuteness,” she says. As I make friends with a Pidgey, build a straw bed for a sleepy Charmander and field a request from an amusingly emo Umbreon who desires a black-painted home, it’s certainly very cute. For Ayano, Pokopia offered a chance to let the cutest Pokémon shine: creatures that are usually cast aside in the mainline games in favour of stronger battlers.View image in fullscreen‘Chill and pop’ … the developers’ key words when building the game.Photograph: Game Freak/The Pokémon Company/Koei TecmoPlaying as a Pokémon rather than the games’ usual human protagonists, you can fully understand – and converse with – every species of Pokémon, and given that Pokémon’s writing is normally pretty bland, the dialogue has unexpected personality. “Because there are no trainers in the game, we really thought about how the Pokémon communicate with each other,” says Takuto Edagawa, Pokopia’s director. “What are they thinking? How are they feeling? We made sure that if you put one piece of furniture anywhere in the world, Pokémon will react based on their personalities. I really liked how it came out.”Pokopia is the first spin-off game that Game Freak has worked on directly, and Ohmori suggests that it may have influenced the direction of future mainline Pokémon games. “Battles have always been the focus, but there are so many [other elements] to these games, and I believe that fans have enjoyed these components as well,” he says. “I would like to show this more and scale the Pokémon games up, outside of battling. And I would like the Pokémon franchise to seek new possibilities to grow the Pokémon world.”Pokopia is released on 5 March; £58.99/$69.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPokémonNintendoNintendo Switch 2Animal CrossingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Preventing water theft. The streamlining of land purchases. If anyone doubted the real purpose of the motley collection ofnew administrative and enforcement measures for the illegally occupied West Bank, Israel’s defence minister spelt it out: “We will continue to kill the idea of a Palestinian state,” Israel Katz said in a joint statement with the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich.While the world’s attention was fixed upon the annihilation in Gaza, settlers in the West Bank intensified their campaign of ethnic cleansing. More than 1,000 Palestinianshave been killed theresince October 2023; a fifth of them were children. Many more have been driven from their homes by relentless harassment and the destruction of infrastructure, withentire Palestinian communities erasedacross vast swathes of land.The Israeli state is not merely complicit in these acts. In addition to theeconomic suffocationand increased military raids in the West Bank, the Guardian reported last month thatsettler-only units of the army are acting as “vigilante militias”. Haaretz newspaper reports that the military hasordered soldiers to prevent Palestinians from ploughingtheir land at the behest of settlers – not only threatening them with destitution, but paving the way for land seizure.With Israel heading to elections in months, Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners are in a hurry. While they and their allies have changed the facts on the ground dramatically, and have steadilyexpanded Israel’s control, the bureaucratic measures adopted by the security cabinet last Sunday are “tectonic”,as one scholar notes. They ease land theft, stripping away the very limited constraints on purchase, and destroy the nominal authority of Palestinians in areas A and B.The White House has reiterated Donald Trump’s opposition to annexation, but talks with Mr Netanyahu in Washington on Wednesday focused on Iran. To the extent that the US president thinks about Palestinians at all, he thinks about Gaza. Yet this cannot be treated separately from theWest Bank. Arab and Islamic states central to his peace plan have warned that the new measures will “inflame violence, deepen the conflict and endanger regional stability and security”.The declaration of a ceasefire in Gaza – which has not stopped the Israeli military killing Palestinians there either – has reduced the political pressure on other governments to act. There are no signs that the outrage at last Sunday’s decision will translate into action. The UK “strongly condemns” the measures. The EU said that sanctions were “still on the table” but is clearly in no hurry to act. WithinIsrael, only a handful dissent.Hunger and desperation endure in Gaza while the Trump administration promotes fantastical visions of a glittering skyline. Israel hasdemolished the East Jerusalem headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa), the UN body which supports millions of Palestinian refugees, and is booting out NGOs, including Médecins Sans Frontières, from across occupied Palestine.In 2024, the UN’s international court of justiceruled that Israel should end its illegal occupationas quickly as possible. Last year international outrage over Gaza forced multiple governments, including the UK, torecognise a Palestinian state, dragged by their publics. Those symbolic announcements look increasingly hollow. Real action cannot wait, for Israel’s government will not.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Times was always bigger, but the two were somewhat comparable.These days, that’s far from reality. The Post has been declining in influence, newsroom staff and financial health – losing at least $100m a year – while the Times is on an astonishing upward trajectory, with operating profit approaching $200m annually.The Times boasts about 13 million digital subscribers compared to the Post’s roughly 2 million. It now has newsroom staff around the world of well over 2,000, while the Post has slipped to only 400, after reaching a height of more than 1,000.There’s no question now of who won the war.As goes the Washington Post: US democracy takes another hit under TrumpRead moreWhy this dramatic difference?I was the Times public editor until 2016, at a moment when consumer-related revenue (especially online subscriptions) became dominant over traditional print-advertising revenue. That was a major milestone on the march to digital success. Then, I was the Post’s media columnist throughout the entire first Trump administration, including during years of encouraging growth and success.So, I’ve seen it all unfold before my eyes. The difference certainly wasn’t about journalistic talent. For decades, both newsrooms have been stuffed to the brim with it, winning Pulitzer Prizes aplenty and hiring great reporters and editors.No, it all came down to leadership.At the Times, a publicly traded company, leadership has been steady, predictable and savvy – always with an eye to the future.As one example, more than a dozen years ago, the soon-to-be publisher, AG Sulzberger, was a driving force behind the “innovation report” that pushed to put the company’s energy into making a radical transition from a newspaper to a digital news company. The report chastised the paper for being behind its competitors on those metrics.His father, publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr, before turning over the reins, hired or promoted people like former BBC honcho Mark Thompson and Meredith Kopit Levien (now CEO), who made smart business decisions while recognizing the primacy of Times journalism.And in the Times newsroom, a steady progression of well-known insiders has prevailed. Newsroom leadership is groomed internally; that practice can foster insularity and self-importance, but it also creates stability.Washington Post history tells a far different story. The paper – famous for its Watergate reporting that exposed a corrupt president – was struggling financially under Graham family ownership in the early 21st century. As print advertising waned, the paper appeared uncertain of whether it was mostly a regional outlet serving the District of Columbia and its suburbs, or a national paper with global ambitions.When Jeff Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur, bought the paper in 2013, it looked like salvation had arrived.Marty Baron, a strong and visionary editor, was already in place, and during his eight-year era, the paper thrived. Forceful journalism held Trump accountable, and both the business side and the newsroom focused on growth and innovation.The publisher, Fred Ryan, nominally Baron’s boss, was mostly benign. And Bezos stayed in the background but admirably didn’t buckle under Trump’s threats and disparagement.When Baron retired in 2021 – succeeded by a much weaker Sally Buzbee, whose background was almost entirely at the Associated Press – and when Bezos later replaced Ryan with the execrable Will Lewis, the wheels came off.All the gains the Post had made – growth in digital subscriptions, and even a couple of years of profitability – began to dissipate.Lewis never connected with the journalists, and his ideas (the creation of a “third newsroom”, whatever that might have meant) did real harm.In one telling moment in early 2022, a great Post reporter, David Fahrenthold, left to join the Times. It was a bad omen.And then, something even worse happened. Shortly before the 2024 election, Bezos started to cozy up to Trump. In a now infamous move, he killed a planned editorial endorsing Kamala Harris, on the purported grounds that endorsement editorials create distrust.Whatever the political leanings of the Post’s readers – they certainly aren’t all liberals – they knew what they were seeing: the loss of editorial independence by an owner more concerned about his commercial interests – not onlyAmazonbut his space company,Blue Origin– than about the storied news organization he was supposed to be stewarding.In protest, about 200,000 Post loyalists canceled their subscriptions. More would follow.Bezos not only failed to address the mess he had made, but he also doubled down by revamping the opinion section and continuing to suck up to Trump.Now after deep layoffs and the overdue firing of Lewis, the Post’s fortunes are troubled, to say the least.“We’re witnessing a murder,” wrote Ashley Parker, a former Post politics reporter now at the Atlantic.If leadership caused this vast separation in fortunes, only enlightened and effective leadership at the Post can begin to close the gap.As someone who has revered the Washington Post for decades, I wish I could see that on the horizon. But I can’t catch even a glimpse.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsMediaOpinionWashington PostNew York TimesNewspapersUS press and publishingNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

It was an ethical and political test of the Australian state. At the very moment a red carpet was rolled out for a man accused of inciting genocide, peaceful Australian citizens were met with batons while exercising their democratic right to protest.For me, this was never an abstract political debate. Before the visit, I pursued the legal channels that are meant to protect citizens andlodged a formal complaintwith the Australian government about the role Herzog played in rhetoric and policies that contributed to the destruction of my family in Gaza. Seven of my relatives were killed. My father died because of a lack of medicine, food and water. My brother, his wife, their four children and her father were also killed. Their bodies remain buried beneath the rubble. Despite the seriousness of this complaint, I have received no response from the government.I later attended a protest in Sydneyconvened specifically in opposition to Herzog’s visit. I did so peacefully. Yet I witnessed fellow demonstrators being confronted with batons and excessive force. My concerns were disregarded when I sought redress through legal channels, and my rights were not respected when I turned to lawful protest. The impression was clear: the state was more intent on silencing dissent than engaging with it.To what extent, then, is the Australian citizen now being disregarded?Conflict at the Sydney anti-Herzog rally was near-inevitable once we gave the state the power to suppress protests | Stephen LawrenceRead moreThis question is especially urgent because Australia is not a state without obligations. It ratified the UN genocide convention in 1949, a foundational pillar of postwar international law that transformed the prevention of genocide from a moral aspiration into a binding legal duty. The convention requires states to exercise due diligence to prevent genocide, to avoid facilitating it, and to refrain from conferring political or diplomatic legitimacy on those credibly accused of inciting it. Breaching these commitments does not merely invite criticism; it undermines Australia’s claim to uphold human rights and the rule of law.When a citizen directly harmed by these policies has their complaint ignored, and is then met with force when protesting peacefully, the message is troubling. Truth becomes inconvenient, and legitimate dissent is treated as a threat.What we have witnessed suggests a dangerous drift away from the values Australia has long claimed to cherish: freedom of expression, the rule of law and democratic accountability. When the protection of power is placed above the protection of citizens, democracy begins to erode from within.The decision to host a figure accused of inciting genocide was a grave political and moral error. The repression of peaceful protesters cannot be dismissed as a mere security misjudgment; it signals a deeper crisis in how the state understands its responsibilities to its own people.Australia now stands at a crossroads. It can either be a country that extends red-carpet treatment to individuals suspected of serious crimes, or a country that safeguards the right of its citizens to protest, pursues justice, and honours its international commitments.The question that should remain before the public is therefore unavoidable: red carpet for Herzog, batons for Australians?Shamikh Badra is an independent Palestinian-Australian researcher and writer.

A genuinely humane government would reform itAndrea EganNew proposals that would force poorly paid migrant workers to wait longer for earned settlement are nothing more than an assault on working-class peopleAndrea Egan is the general secretary of UnisonThu 12 Feb 2026 09.10 ESTLast modified on Thu 12 Feb 2026 11.48 ESTShareBillionaires and politicians fan the flames of hate, but without migrant workers, Britain would grind to a halt. That’s especially true when it comes to health and social care:more than a fifthof the NHS workforce is made up of migrant staff. The same proportion of care workers nationally are migrants, rising tohalfin London.Yet these workers, many of whom are members of Unison, have increasingly become a punchbag for politicians. In particular, they have become a scapegoat for this Labour government, which has sunk to a new low with its proposals onearned settlement. These changes could see low-paid public sector workers, including carers, forced to wait15 yearsbefore being granted indefinite leave to remain, instead of the five years they were promised before they made the decision to come here. These changes would entrench and worsen the environment of fear and exploitation that defines the current system.This is nothing less than a full-frontal attack on migrant workers and a wrecking ball for public services from a government that should be standing up for both. We already have a visa system that ties care workers to their employers, leaving them vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Months without pay. Working without days off for weeks on end. Grafting for 16 hours and only getting paid for two of them.As Unison general secretary, I have been speaking to our migrant members in the care sector, and what I hear is harrowing. “Every conversation with the managers feels threatening, and often ends with the word ‘visa’,” a domiciliary care worker from India said. Another member put it starkly: “We cannot continue to work under these kinds of pressures. It is emotionally draining and mentally exhausting. You lose yourself. Fear becomes your shadow.”When Unison raises these issues with politicians, we are often told it’s just a few “bad apple” employers. But insecure work, zero-hour contracts, illegally low pay and exploitative practices more widely are endemic throughout the social care sector. Our members are silenced as the threat of deportation is punitively held over them. I don’t say it lightly, but the sponsorship system has effectively made modern slavery a structural feature of our care system.A genuinely humane government would do away with this heartless system. But despite the urging of Unison – in anational campaignled by our migrant members – this Labour government is proposing to extend it. For many of our members who had only months left before being freed from the terrifying vulnerability of sponsorship, the Home Office is proposing to lock them into exploitation for another decade and more.These proposals are not just an attack on the migrant care workers who work beyond breaking point to look after us. They are also an attack on the most basic values of theLabourparty, in offering rapid routes to settlement for those earning six-figure salaries while making lower-paid workers wait and continue to suffer.Such a hierarchy is based on the notion that care workers are “low-skilled”becausethey are low-paid. The logic could not be more perverse. Care work is highly skilled work, and it is only paid so poorly because of the failure of successive governments to value it properly. The Home Officedescribingthose who run our health and social care system as low contributors and making this a metric of human worth, having failed to ensure they are paid fairly, is an attack on the working class.Care in England is already creaking, and without urgent action it risks outright collapse. The demand our migrant members are dealing with is gargantuan. Age UK estimates that 2 million older people haveunmet care needs, while up to 1.5 million working-age disabled people may be missing out on support they are entitled to.At the same time, the workforce is haemorrhaging staff, with vacancy rates among the highest of any sector and nearly a quarter of workers leaving each year. The root cause is no mystery – it’s low pay. Four in five jobs in the wider economy pay better than the care sector. Such depressed wages push workers into poverty and food insecurity.Sadly, the government seems determined to make the environment for migrant workers in this country more hostile than ever. But Unison will always stand up for our members, regardless of where they were born. Indeed, in leading our Fair Visa Campaign, migrant members are standing up for themselves: late last year,they organisedone of the biggest parliamentary lobbies in modern history, with 700 migrant workers travelling to meet their MPs. This week, more than 70 parliamentariansjoined usin opposing the unfair indefinite leave to remain changes.Labour MPs vying to replace the prime minister must take the fight to the far right instead of imitating it, stand up for migrant workers by dropping the earned settlement proposals, and represent thewholeworking class. This is the stuff of basic principles. Unison will use its unparalleled size and resources without hesitation to challenge any politician who fails to live up to them.Andrea Egan is the general secretary of UnisonExplore more on these topicsCare workersOpinionMigrationSocial careLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

The morning light was harsh; the algorithm harsher. Somewhere between a video of a dog doing taxes and a girl making her matcha, I stumbled upon Mel Robbins, motivational speaker and Ted Talk legend, telling me to high-five myself.The video had pandemic energy. That quiet, echoey desperation of someone who’s spent too long indoors talking to objects. Mel explained that in her darkest days she looked at herself in the mirror and gave herself a high-five.“You are your own cheerleader,” she said. “You’ve survived 100% of your worst days.” I lay there, blinking. It sounded stupid enough to work.Mel Robbinshas a podcast, a bestselling book (The High 5 Habit) and a global tour. Hundreds of thousands of people apparently gather to high-five themselves into transcendence. There were studies cited, testimonials, people in the comments declaring it had changed their lives.Schools that cultivate the mind but neglect spiritual education leave children unanchored in a challenging world | Kat EghdamianRead moreOf course people are high-fiving themselves in 2026. What else are we meant to do? We live in a world where eggs cost $12, affordable housing is a myth and governments fund moral decay. The self-help economy thrives because it offers a sense of agency; the illusion that if we just reframe, breathe, manifest, hydrate, optimise … we can out-think the chaos.Mel’s high-five was a mirror-slap heard round the world. And for a brief moment, even my cynicism wanted to join in.So I decided to invent my own method. Something equally absurd yet profoundly spiritual. A practice that could heal the modern soul.Introducing: The Hiccup Method™!At its core, it’s simple. The next time you hiccup, don’t curse it, don’t suppress it, observe it. A hiccup, after all, is a spasm of surrender. Your diaphragm reminding you that you’re a living, twitching miracle.There are three ways to get rid of a hiccup:1. Forget about it.2. Get scared.3. Hold your breath for seven seconds.Each, it turns out, is a masterclass in mindfulness.Forgetting about it? That’s the art of letting go. Manifestation’s secret twin. When you stop obsessing, reality finally has room to cooperate. It’s why your crush texts back the moment you give up, or the buffering video loads when you look away.Getting scared? Exposure therapy in real time. Clarity through chaos. Fear, in its purest form, snaps us awake. It’s likeWim Hofmeets a mild cardiac arrest. It’s why we watch horror movies or check our bank balance; to feel something.And holding your breath? That’s meditation, baby. For seven seconds you become acutely aware of your body, the lungs, the ribs, the pulse in your neck, until you exhale. The best part? Those seven seconds after, when you wait, suspended, listening for the next hiccup you hope never comes.Six … Seven … Eight … hic.Damn. Gotta go again.That’s presence. That’s enlightenment. That’s also mildly inconvenient if you’re in public. The Hiccup Method™ could revolutionise how we live.There will, of course, be an app. You’ll grant friends permission to scare you at random times throughout the day, logging each fright like digital accountability buddies.For a small subscription fee, you’ll gain access to Hiccup Hub™, where users post daily affirmations like:“Today I embraced fear and choked on my oat milk.”Premium members can upload hiccup recordings for waveform analysis and spiritual calibration by certified Hiccup Coaches.We’ll host retreats in Byron Bay where participants hiccup in synchrony at sunset, releasing trauma through collective diaphragm spasms while chanting “The Future Is Spasmodic”.Young, lost and unemployed, I misread all the signs without realising the value in mistakes | Sofie LagunaRead moreWe’ll sell ethically sourced breath-hold timers made from recycled meditation bells.There will be Ted Talks. There will be lawsuits. But most of all, there will be healing. And merch.We’ll launch Hi-Cups™, hand-blown artisanal glassware designed to capture the unique vibrational frequency of your hiccups. Each Hi-Cup will come numbered, chakra-coded and lightly misted with eucalyptus tears.The collected hiccups will be shipped to our Nimbin headquarters for Energetic Harvesting™, where sound healers and venture capitalists will work side-by-side to convert your hiccups into usable spiritual energy.We’ll go viral, obviously. Goop will release a $220 “Hiccup Harmoniser” made from rose quartz. Apple will announce the iHic, tracking diaphragmatic mindfulness in real time. Breath influencers will sell “Trachea massages” for $499 a pop.And just when society reaches peak absurdity, someone, copycats, will unveil the sequel: The Fart Method™. Nature’s original release. A system of radical surrender for the post-capitalist colon.But at the centre of it all, beneath the branding, the buzzwords, the biodegradable breath-hold timers, will remain the purest truth of all:You were never broken, you were just holding your breath. And now, finally, you can hiccup.Miski Omar is a speech pathologist, writer and director from SydneyExplore more on these topicsMental healthOpinionHealthSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

But democratise our economy and a better world is within our graspThu 12 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 12 Feb 2026 17.16 ESTShareWe have an urgent responsibility. Our existing economic system is incapable of addressing the social and ecological crises we face in the 21st century. When we look around we see an extraordinary paradox. On the one hand, we have access to remarkable new technologies and a collective capacity to produce more food, more stuff than we need or that the planet can afford. Yet at the same time, millions of people suffer in conditions of severe deprivation.What explains this paradox? Capitalism. By capitalism we do not mean markets, trade and entrepreneurship, which have been around for thousands of years before the rise of capitalism. By capitalism we mean something very odd and very specific: an economic systemthat boils down to a dictatorship run by the tiny minority who control capital – the big banks, the major corporations and the 1% who own the majority of investible assets. Even if we live in a democracy and have a choice in our political system, our choices never seem to change the economic system. Capitalists are the ones who determine what to produce, how to use our labour and who gets to benefit. The rest of us – the people who are actuallydoingthe production – do not get a say.And for capital, the purpose of production is not primarily to meet human needs or to achieve social progress, much less to deliver on any ecological goals. The purpose is to maximise and accumulate profit. That is the overriding objective. This is the capitalist law of value. And to maximise profits, capital requires perpetual growth – ever increasing aggregate production, regardless of whether it is necessary or harmful.So we end up with irrational forms of production as a result: we get massive production of thingssuch as SUVs, mansions and fast fashion, because these things are highly profitable to capital, but chronic underproduction of obviously necessary things like affordable housing and public transit, because these are much less profitable to capital, or not profitable at all.View image in fullscreen‘Renewables are already much cheaper than fossil fuels. Alas, fossil fuels are up to three times as profitable.’ Tibetan sheep graze at a solar farm in Qinghai province, China, 1 July 2025.Photograph: Ng Han Guan/APSimilarly with energy. Renewables arealready much cheaperthan fossil fuels. Alas, fossil fuels are up tothree times as profitable. Thus capital forces governments to link electricity prices tothe price of the most expensiveliquified natural gas, not of cheap solar energy. Similarly, building and maintaining motorways is many times more lucrative for private contractors, car manufacturers and oil companies than a modern network of superfast, safe public railways. So capitalists continue to push our governments to subsidise fossil fuels and road building, even while the world burns.Since Donald Trump’s election, many major investment firms haveenthusiastically abandonedtheirclimate commitments, which had, in favour of the common good, restrained their profitability. This should be a clarifying moment for all of us: capitalism cares about our species’ prospects as much as a wolf cares about a lamb’s.So here we are: trapped in capitalism’s set of priorities, which are inimical to humanity’s. Human ingenuity has bequeathed us splendid technologies and capacities. But, like a cruel divinity, capital not only prevents us from using them for our collective good, but in fact coerces us to deploy them towards our collective doom.The system also locks us into never-ending cycles of imperialist violence. Capital accumulation in advanced economies relies on massive inputs of cheap labour and nature from the global south. To maintain this arrangement, capital uses every tool at its disposal – debt, sanctions, coups and even outright military invasion to keep southern economies subordinate.The solution is staring us in the face. We urgently need to overcome the capitalist law of value and democratise our economy, so that we can organise production around urgent social and ecological priorities. After all,weare the producers of the goods, the services, the technologies. It isourlabour andourplanet’s resources that are at stake. And sowemust claim the right to decide what is produced, how, and for what purpose.How can this be done? There are three necessary conditions for the transformation of our economy from a dead-end dictatorship into a functioning and ecologically sound democratic one.The first condition is a new financial architecture that penalises destructive private “investments” and enables public finance for public purposes. At the heart of this architecture we need a new public investment bank that, in association with the central banks, converts available liquidity into the types of investment consistent with common, sustainable prosperity.The second condition is the extensive use of deliberative democracy to decide sectoral, regional and national goals (eg regarding the growth or even winding down of different outputs) towards which the new public finance tools will be aimed.Perilous and chaotic, Trump’s ‘liberation day’ endangers the world’s broken economy – and him | Martin KettleRead moreAnd the third condition is a Great Corporate Reform Act for the purpose of democratising corporations, favouring and promoting the formation of companies run along the lines of one employee, one share, one vote.We live in a shadow of the world we could create. A world in which we shall be able to avert an almost certain ecological collapse, rather than waiting around for capitalism to push us beyond the point of no return. A world where the abolition of economic insecurity, precarity, poverty, unemployment and indignity is possible, while we lead meaningful lives within planetary boundaries. This is not a distant dream. It is a tangible prospect.Jason Hickel is professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and a visiting senior fellow at LSE.

The problem has endured for too longThu 12 Feb 2026 05.41 ESTLast modified on Thu 12 Feb 2026 07.35 ESTShareAs the BBC closes in on a new director general, the possibility again arises that it could be a woman. The talk is of the former BBC One controllerJay Hunt, the former Channel 4 boss Alex Mahon or the former BBC chief content officerCharlotte Moore.At this point in the BBC’s history, almost everyone would applaud a woman at the top – but clearly the institution needs a lot more than a woman, however pioneering and accomplished, at the helm. We know from theexcoriating reportcommissioned by the broadcaster itself that it has a grave problem with dwindling numbers of “older women” presenters. Trevor Phillips, 72, still shines at Sky, while David Aaronovitch, 71, is deservedly a fixture on Radio 4: they’re just older men, experienced journalists, doing their thing.But women are different, it seems – especially after midlife, according to the report, with a “noticeable mismatch” at theBBCin the treatment of women over 60 in news, in content more broadly and in regional broadcasting (so pretty much everything).This will come as zero surprise to female broadcasters who have been saying this for years, but who have been fobbed off by too-busy-to-care commissioners or have been urged to be content with a short slot on someone else’s presenting gig (usually a man’s). Worse, they will have been made to feel pushy or insistent for wanting a fair share of the limelight. Any new director general, male or female, needs to know how this plays out – and to figure out how to change it.View image in fullscreenFrom left to right: Charlotte Moore, Jay Hunt and Alex Mahon, all of whom have been linked with the director general role at the BBC.Composite: VariousFrom the report, we see that the broadcaster has made progress with female presenters under 50, so something clearly happens to make them disappear thereafter. That process can seem inexorable. They move from being called “veteran” reporters to appearing less and less, and then just giving up on attempts to get the good-quality work they want. They move into a parallel world as opportunities dwindle and others are picked for roles they were not encouraged to apply for, filling openings they never knew existed.There are women inside the organisation who have taken it to task – including in legal disputes,alleging unfair practices as they aged. But winning legal battles is not the same as changing a culture.I can speak to the feeling of a largish group of broadcasters whom I call “inside-outers”: those connected to, but not directly employed by, the corporation. We have been around at the BBC but can speak independently. I started commentating from the wars in Yugoslavia and from Moscow when Boris Yeltsin was Russian president. I now present on the arts and ideas show Free Thinking, and appear as a Moral Maze panellist on Radio 4. That is a very agreeable situation, and broadcasters do worry about being seen as whingers, which can become a double bind. If we don’t raise an issue, we are judged to be content – not just for ourselves, but with the situation in general.The new director general will need to be more keenly aware of the excuses that facilitate this disappearing of female presenters, whether staff or freelance. Here is some of the overfamiliar reasoning: “We need to refresh the coverage or range of voices, so this means ringing the changes.” This will be followed by the realisation that the programme’s solid bloke has survived the “refresh” because they are an authoritative kingpin, while the women have been refreshed out.View image in fullscreenThe former BBC Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly, who in 2011 won an employment tribunal against the BBC on the grounds of ageism.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The ObserverAnother fob-off runs: “Your name will be at the table.” Never believe this. Clearly, a broadcaster can’t run a Britain’s Got Talent-style quest every time a vacancy opens, but when the circle of applicants is drawn tight and the process is opaque, who actually gets anywhere near the table and who is excluded on the grounds that they don’t fit is the point.There’s also: “What’s the problem? You’re doing fine as it is – and anyway, there is a queue round the block to host Gardeners’ Question Time/Just a Minute/Whatever show you’re interested in.” Translated, it means: “I cannot be bothered with this conversation.”No one would say the problem is exclusive to the BBC. Who can forget the “Last fuckable day”skit by Tina Fey, Amy Schumer, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Patricia Arquette, highlighting the sell-by date on women getting sexy Hollywood roles. This is the less sexy equivalent. But we do expect more from a broadcaster that is also a thought leader.In a 2017 article for the Guardian,I wrote: “The BBC’s intellectual spadework is still done mainly by men of a similar outlook and type. Director general Tony Hall should get on with changing that, but distortions will persist until broadcasters think more adventurously about what women are capable of.”That was nine years ago now. How much opportunity and talent has been washed away since then? How much more in TV, in radio and now in podcasting will be squandered unless someone finally stops BBC women disappearing?Incoming director general, whether you’re male or female: good luck. So many female broadcasters inside and outside the Beeb’s walls would be happy to hear from you.Anne McElvoy is executive editor at Politico and host of Politics at Sam and Anne’s, as well as a BBC contributorExplore more on these topicsBBCOpinionInequalityWomenGendercommentShareReuse this content"

She didn’t want it to become the headline that she sometimes thinks of herself as a gay man – but clearly forgot how neurotic and demagogic much of the British press becomes if you say anything mildly provocative about sexuality and gender.Here’s what happened. Inan interviewlast week with the American LGBTQ+ publication Them, when asked about her penchant for taking roles in films featuring LGBTQ+ characters (say, The Favourite or Heartstopper), the actor said that she feels that she has a foot in various camps. “Throughout my whole life, I’ve had arguments with people where I’ve always felt sort of nonbinary … I’ve never felt massively feminine in my being female. I’ve always described myself to my husband as a gay man. And he goes, ‘Yeah, I get that.’”Now, you could easily park this in the category of “vacuous things celebrities say when attempting to get you to watch their film” (in this case,Jimpa, in which Colman plays the mother of a non-binary teenager). Or in another, even more obnoxious category: “things wealthy white celebrities with cushty lives say to make themselves sound a little more interesting”. Britain’s rightwing media has been unforgiving. The Telegraph asked if she is “the most insufferable Left-wing celebrity in Britain” while, for UnHerd, Colman is “a handmaiden in the contemporary rebirth of anti-woman logic” and has committed “a drive-by erasure of the homosexual male experience”.But honestly, what is the big deal? As a gay man, I read Colman’s comments and felt something more like relief. Truth be told, as one of three boys, I have sometimes referred to myself as “my mother’s only daughter”, and I’ve never thought to count myself out when my predominantly female friends refer to us as “the girls” on a night out. I’ve been invited to many a “galentines”.I know that I am a man – just like, I’m sure, Colman knows that she is a woman. But the truth is that many, if not all of us, experience moments of disorientation around gender or think about how ridiculous the whole system of categorising identities is. You may find Colman’s comments confusing and incoherent, but how confusing is it that our behaviours, identities and very beings are expected to be neatly and continually divided based on our private parts and what we do with them?As for “a drive-by erasure of the homosexual male experience” – what tosh. I am fine if heterosexual women sometimes feel that they have a foot in gay male identity. I am a Madonna fanatic (a very gay thing of me to be) and often find myself nodding in agreement when listening to her 2000 hit What It Feels Like for a Girl, which she wrote while trying to conceal her pregnancy from the media. I will never know the experience of pregnancy or of being a woman, but whenever I listen I do find myself thinking: “yes, world,do youknow what it feels like for a girl???” What is so wrong with that?Likewise, Colman or any other heterosexual woman might find themselves participating in, or relating to, aspects of gay male culture that they feel an affinity with. And clearly anyone can tap into aspects of gay culture. The brilliant theorist of gender David Halperin, in his book How to Be Gay, carefully argues that while stereotypes of gay male behaviour might be offensive, they are clearly based in reality. He goes on to say that gayness is more than just who you have sex with, it is also “something you do”. This “means that you don’t have to be homosexual in order to do it”. It’s an idea that would make so many people furiously protective, but I am keen on an expansive view of identity that isn’t simply reduced to core biological functions and urges.This might all seem like a storm in a teacup – throwaway comments getting sucked through social media and thrown into the culture war meat-grinder in Britain. But however seriously Colman meant her comments, they have an important effect – making us all think about the ways in which gender shows up in our lives as a silly, messy and contradictory prism for understanding ourselves. We should be able to talk about reconciling experiences of campness, butchness, femininity and masculinity – we should be able to express the feeling that we’re something other than what we’ve been categorised as. So, Colman, ignore the cynics: remember that, just like your husband, many of us heard your words and thought: yeah, I get it.Jason Okundaye is an assistant Opinion editor at the GuardianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It won’t be thePeter Mandelsonscandal, the policy U-turns or the bleak nights at provincial counting centres. All these are symptoms, not the disease. No, what is turning the guy elected just 19 months ago into an ex-prime minister is the slow realisation among ministers, colleagues and voters of one essential truth about the man: there is less to him than meets the eye.His promises get shrunk in the wash. A green new deal is jettisoned, an Employment Rights Act has a large watering can poured over it, a bold manifesto pledge to end Britain’s feudal leasehold laws suddenly grows caveats.The same goes for his claimed achievements, a modest puddle that in sunlight swiftly evaporates. Just listen to his cabinet ministers this week, mouthing hostage-video messages of their boss’s achievements: a roll-call that begins with extended childcare – actually one of the last deeds of Rishi Sunak – andscrapping the two-child benefit cap, forced on No 10 by Labour backbenchers.In this land of vanished crafts and endangered trades, there did arise recently a nice cottage industry of defining “Starmerism”. Writers and academics tried to plumb its depths and chart its hinterland. Some bravely went as far as Reigate in Surrey to search for clues in the man’s childhood home, but all eventually gave up the task as hopeless, the last surrendering somewhere between his government’s ninth and 11th U-turn.They could have saved themselves the bother and simply defined it as shrinking ambitions, attainments, electoral base. It’s not a philosophy but a business model, and for years it was taken as a profitable one – even if some of uswarned of the dangers long ago. Now it is understood as leading only to bankruptcy.When Mandelson texted his Westminster apprentice Wes Streeting last March that “the government problems do not stem from comms”, he was spot on. The problem is not communications; it’s that there is so little to pass on. And when No 10 talks about how its resident willnow be “unleashed”, it will soon become apparent that there was no big beast to put on a lead.Starmer began his fightback this week with a solemn vow to purge Westminster lobbyists, a risible claim from a government filled with lobbyists. Jacqui Smith, the frontbencher sent out on Monday to defend her man was, until Starmer gave her a job, a lobbyist. Starmer’s jobs tsar, Alan Milburn, has mademore than £8m from lobbying, while another former New Labour minister, Jim Murphy, runs a lobbying firm where two staffers in 2024 became MPs for Starmer. Indeed, according to the journalist Peter Geoghegan, 34 of the most recent intake of Labour MPsworked in lobbying.Less-ism applies not just to the prime minister, but his circle; not just their policies, but their careers. Consider the man whose shadow looms over this entire week, the just-departed chief of staff,Morgan McSweeney. In their career obits, journalists across the press praised the man for three key achievements. First: he was the “hammer of the left” against what was left of Ted Knight’s Trotskyism in the London borough of Lambeth. The dates alone mean this can’t be true: when Knight ran Lambeth back in the 1980s, McSweeney would have been in primary school in County Cork. By the time the Irishman came to London Labour, the party’s big fight was not against “the hard left” but the Lib Dems.Second: he was the hero of the 2010 Battle for Barking, that mass mobilisation of anti-fascists against the British National party. It was a fight over months that culminated one Saturday in spring when more than 500 people turned out to campaign against Nick Griffin getting into parliament. Of a number of volunteers and witnesses I have spoken to about that campaign, no one remembers McSweeney playing a significant role. The Battle for Barking gets its own chapter in How to Defeat the Far Right by Nick Lowles, one of its organisers and a seasoned anti-fascist. McSweeney is not mentioned once by Lowles, either in the chapter or across the whole book. Among those who do get mentioned is Sam Tarry, a “young but experienced campaigner” from Barking, who even sleeps in the office to guard it from violent racists. Tarry later became aLabourMP, but was blocked from running again by Starmer and McSweeney’s regime.Finally, there is of course the landslide of 2024: a historic and remarkable turnaround, yet not the triumph that McSweeney and Starmer hoped for. They believed that flags and tanks might win over “hero voters” who had once been red but then turned blue. It didn’t. Labour’s overall vote share only rose by 1.6 percentage points on the great wipeout of 2019. The person who actually won the 2024 election for Starmer is clearly Liz Truss, a disaster in office while splitting the rightwing vote.The net result is that Starmer has a bigger majority than Clement Attlee in 1945, but a platform closer to Sunak’s. In a forthcoming textual analysis of the manifestos of the two parties down the decades, York University’s Kevin Farnsworth observes that Starmer’s manifesto for “change” was strikingly similar in language and positions to Sunak’s manifesto at the same election. It was, he writes, “a decisive embrace of positions historically closer to Conservative than Labour platforms”.Politicians and journalists love myth-making, but the danger of preferring legends to history is that you have no guide to take you forward. One of the guiding attitudes of Starmer and McSweeney’s regime has been that grave danger lies in looking even a few millimetres left, which is why he and his team have felt no compunction in taking pops at Andy Burnham and Sadiq Khan, and trying to kick out of their party anyone who even looked like a dissenter. Not just Jeremy Corbyn but peaceable figures from the soft left such as Neal Lawson (threatened with expulsion for endorsing a call on Twitter for cross-party cooperation).I’ve watched every minute of the hour’s worth of footage of the former Labour metro mayor Jamie Driscoll getting browbeaten by party bureaucrats for simply sitting on stage with the legendary leftwing film-maker Ken Loach. I’ve also read the accounts of long-serving councillors and community figures barred from even being considered as a Labour candidate for parliament for such apparent misdemeanours as “liking” atweet from Nicola Sturgeonsaying that she was free of Covid.This is McCarthyism dressed up as election-winning politics and it has failed. The result is not much of a government, and barely even a party. It’s a faction, a nasty narrow rightwing faction of what was once one of democracy’s great pluralist traditions. In place of real politics, it has office politics. The refrain that Starmer is a “decent” man does not fit his record of deceiving his way to the top of the Labour party, sitting on his hands during the massacre in Gaza or clamping down on protest against it.This government is already toast, one Labour heavyweight told me this week, but the Labour party – a 125-year-old political project – may not survive Starmer and McSweeney. The diminution of the party’s horizons is clear when one considers the leadership election to come. Fifty years ago, the battle to replace Harold Wilson drew heavyweights from Tony Benn to Roy Jenkins. In 2015, the range went from Corbyn to Liz Kendall. This year we are likely to have Streeting, a former student politician, versus someone from the soft left. There are no ideas in contest here, little semblance of a plan for change.Now the shrinking is being done for them by us, the voters. Labour’s polling is disastrous. At each election, leftwing voters ask: who is the candidate to stop Farage’s candidate? In Caerphilly, it was Plaid Cymru. In Gorton and Denton this month it may be the Greens. But it rarely seems to be Starmer.Voters are actively searching out alternatives. Because why should they settle for less?Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistThis article was amended on 12 February 2026. An earlier version said Tony Benn and Roy Jenkins took part in the contest to replace Jim Callaghan as Labour prime minister; however, it was Harold Wilson who had resigned.Explore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerMorgan McSweeneyPeter MandelsonLobbyingcommentShareReuse this content"

Here we are againZoya PatelAs a first generation immigrant, it is gutting to see Australians falling for One Nation’s anti-immigration rhetoric 30 years on from Hanson’s initial riseWed 11 Feb 2026 20.05 ESTLast modified on Wed 11 Feb 2026 23.52 ESTShareI’ve been cynical about politics for a long time, especially when it comes to Australian attitudes to racism and immigration. The latter has always been the favourite scapegoat of rightwing politicians to blame for anything they don’t want to meaningfully address through policy – house prices rising? Unemployment rates too high? Economic inequality growing? It’s because of all those foreigners, obviously, coming here to steal jobs, houses and food right out of the mouths of “Aussie families”. It’s so predictable it’s almost boring.But I will admit that even my hardened black heart was dismayed to see the recent polls that show arise in popularityfor One Nation. While I know that the factors driving poll outcomes are complex, it is gutting to see Australians falling for the same rubbish 30 years after I thought we were done with Pauline Hanson for good.One Nation may be soaring in the polls but history suggests it will struggle to go mainstream | Tom McIlroyRead moreI grew up in the mid-90s in country New South Wales, having arrived in 1992 as a first generation immigrant, and Hanson’s initial rise to political notoriety is a core memory from my childhood. It is the first time I remember consciously realising that my family and I were not necessarily welcome in Australia, and that there was a cohort of the community who didn’t like us for no reason other than our visible cultural difference.Because even then, I knew that the only markable difference between my family of six – my dad an engineer and my mum running our small takeaway store, my siblings and I in public schools – and my friends’ families was our skin colour. In every other way that mattered, there was very little distinction between our lives and theirs – my parents worked hard and paid taxes, we studied and hoped to build careers and families in Australia, and we were invested in our local community.My parents were aware of the impact of her racist rhetoric even then. They made a joke of it, and we often listened to the Pauline Pantsdown parody, shouting “Please Explain!” from the backseat of the car.When Hanson wasn’t elected in 1998, I thought that ugly period of anti-immigration rhetoric was behind us. And yet here we are, with polls recording One Nation’s popularity surging, and other high-profile ideologues like Barnaby Joyce joining their ranks and reinforcing their dangerous message.I spent some time this week lurking through social media trying to pinpoint why people would possibly think that One Nation offers a viable solution to the issues facing the middle and working class in Australia – issues which are primarily around income and resource scarcity, a result of an unequal economic system that has more to do with the income gap between the highest and lowest earners in our country (and the systems that favour the former) than immigration.The overwhelming message I got was “there are too many foreigners here, taking our jobs and houses” and also “they don’t want to assimilate”. The first I find bemusing, because as any immigrant will tell you, it’s not exactly easy to migrate to Australia. It’s costly, and you have to meet many strict criteria to qualify for any of the three main streams of immigration. I have seen plenty of family and community members over the years try and fail to do it.And the second I find exhausting, because the idea that there is some golden standard of Australian culture, that hasn’t been entirely developed and constructed by the multicultural influences that have tried to form this nation (not to mention off the violent genocide and dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people), is clearly a myth. And as someone who has assimilated so hard that at times my sheer Australianness has been a barrier between me and my Indian culture, I can confirm there is no end point of assimilation that will counteract the racism that simply doesn’t like the fact of my skin colour.Have we suddenly become a nation of gullible xenophobes overnight? | First Dog on the MoonRead moreAs a child, my parents tried to counterbalance the racism we saw on the news, led byPauline Hanson, by pointing out all of the people in our community who obviously loved the multiculturalism at the heart of Australian culture.But when I think about trying to create this same balance for my own son, I feel deflated. Am I to spend the next 30 years dealing with the same, tired, repetitive racism that I thought we had finally conquered when Hanson was defeated the first time? Or will the rest of the country finally wake up and realise that focusing on immigration and culture wars is actually just a clever way of distracting us from the real inequalities we’re all facing, that have very little to do with skin colour or when we arrived here, and more to do with a system that functions off the oppression of many to secure the success of a minority?Zoya Patel is a writer and editor based in CanberraExplore more on these topicsOne NationOpinionAustralian politicsPauline HansonAustralian economycommentShareReuse this content"

Katy Perry – Firework (2010)The oeuvre of Katy Perry occasionally has some profoundly unexpected inspirations: California Gurls is spelt in homage to Big Star’s September Gurls, while Firework was based on, wait for it, Jack Kerouac’s On the Road, specifically the line about how his favourite people “burn like fabulous yellow roman candles”.19. Japanese Breakfast – Magic Mountain (2025)Abestselling author herself, Michelle Zauner’s latest album as Japanese Breakfast referenced Virginia Woolf, John Cheever and, on its sweet but sad acoustic closing track, Thomas Mann’s sanatorium-based door-stopper Magic Mountain. It’s a song that seems to reflect Zauner’s reaction to the book, and deploy its imagery to explore her own relationship with fame and creativity.18. Bomb the Bass – Bug Powder Dust (1994)Bug Powder Dust certainly isn’t the only song inspired by the oeuvre of William Burroughs – he’s the link between Duran Duran’s Wild Boys and Throbbing Gristle’s An Old Man Smiled – but it’s definitely the funkiest. Justin Warfield delivers a Naked Lunch-themed rap, over a writhing bass line and immense breakbeat.17. Taylor Swift – The Bolter (2024)Taylor Swift has described herself as “your favourite English teacher”, a nod to the literary references in her songs. The expanded The Tortured Poets Department featured The Bolter, based on a recurring villain in Nancy Mitford’s novels (in turn based on five-times-married British aristocrat Idina Sackville) who Swift identified with.16. Killer Mike – Willie Burke Sherwood (2012)There are plenty of literary allusions in hip-hop, but Willie Burke Sherwood – Killer Mike’s first collaboration with El-P, with whom he’d later form Run the Jewels – skilfully entwines references to Lord of the Flies through its autobiographical saga of growing up “addicted to literature” in the wrong part of town.15. The Cure – Charlotte Sometimes (1981)The obvious choice for literary Cure is the Camus-inspired Killing an Arab, but let’s instead plump for marvellous goth-pop set text Charlotte Sometimes, its title and theme taken from Penelope Farmer’s splendidly creepy 1969 children’s novel. It clearly lived rent-free in Robert Smith’s head, also inspiring the Cure’s 1984 album track The Empty World.14. Black Star – Thieves in the Night (1998)In the sleeve notes of Mos Def and Talib Kweli’s first album as Black Star, the latter wrote about discovering Toni Morrison’s novel The Bluest Eye. The chorus of Thieves in the Night – a musically mellow, lyrically barbed exploration of racial identity and hip-hop’s perpetuation of stereotypes – is essentially a passage from the novel.13. Nirvana – Scentless Apprentice (1993)At the height of his unhappy celebrity, Kurt Cobain obviously identified with the anti-hero of Patrick Suskind’s Perfume, who’s devoured by his own acolytes. Should you doubt Cobain meant it, listen to the frankly terrifying way he repeatedly sings “go away” – it’s the sound of someone at the end of their tether.12. Radiohead – Street Spirit (Fade Out) (1995)Ben Okri’s Booker-winning novel The Famished Road – about a child trapped between the spirit world and life in Nigeria – inspired the drift of disturbing, dream-like images on The Bends’ closing track, an artistic breakthrough that pointed the way to OK Computer, and struck a rare optimistic note at its conclusion: “Immerse your soul in love.”11. Rosalía – Pienso en Tu Mirá (2018)As if to prove from the start that she was noticeably different to your average 21st-century pop star, every track on Rosalía’s first album of original material was based on a chapter from the 13th-century Occitan romance Flamenca: Pienso en Tu Mirá’s amazing confection of flamenco rhythms, dancefloor bass and spectral pop is chapter three.10. David Bowie – We Are the Dead (1974)Bowie famously wanted to write a musical based on George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, but the writer’s estate refused permission. Of the fragments that made their way on to Diamond Dogs, We Are the Dead is the pick, not least because it’s the most thrillingly diseased, decadent-sounding five minutes that the glam era produced.9. The Normal – Warm Leatherette (1978)The influence of JG Ballard’s dystopian science fiction hung heavy over post-punk, from Gary Numan to Joy Division, but never seemed more pointed than on Daniel Miller’s groundbreaking single inspired by 1973’s Crash. Unsettling but danceable, the awesome Warm Leatherette perfectly captures the novel’s disturbingly cold treatment of violence, horror and sexual arousal.8. Kendrick Lamar – King Kunta (2015)A lesson in African American literature bound up in four minutes of firecracker rapping set to a superlatively funky backing. The title comes from Alex Haley’s 1976 novel Roots, but the lyrics of King Kunta divert into references to Ralph Ellison’s 1952BildungsromanInvisible Man, and Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart.7. Magazine – A Song From Under the Floorboards (1980)Some songs are only tangentially linked to their literary inspirations, but Magazine’s masterpiece of tense, brooding post-punk existential dread is so clearly inspired by Dostoevsky’s novella Notes From Underground – check out their respective opening lines! – that the Russian author possibly deserved a co-writing credit.6. Kate Bush – The Sensual World (1989)Wuthering Heights is better known, but its brilliance in rendering a classic novel is equalled by The Sensual World, inspired by James Joyce’s Ulysses. Bush was denied the rights to use Joyce’s actual text, so she translated Molly Bloom’s reverie into a song that’s beautiful, drowsy, amatory and better than the subsequent version that did use Joyce’s words.5. Joni Mitchell – Both Sides Now (1969)The lyrics were sparked by Mitchell reading Saul Bellow’s 1959 novel Henderson the Rain King while on a plane; a passage about clouds inspired the opening verses. Both Sides Now is a song Mitchell has grown into. If you want the most emotionally impactful version, hear her singing it, aged 79, on her Live at Newport album.4. Jefferson Airplane – White Rabbit (1967)Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland transformed into one of the jewels of parent-scaring American psychedelia, White Rabbit is effectively the Merry Pranksters’ challenge –Can YOUpasstheacidtest?– in musical form. In a slightly foreboding tone, it jumbled Lewis Carroll’s imagery to evoke a jarring, brain-scrambling departure from normality.From Dylan to Ishiguro: can song lyrics ever be literature?Read more3. Joy Division – Dead Souls (1980)The late Ian Curtis’s library ranged from Sven Hassel to Kafka, Burroughs and Ballard: all made their way into his songs. On Dead Souls, the titular deceased of Nikolai Gogol’s satirical novel crowd into his Curtis’s head, “calling” him against his will. “Someone take these dreams away,” he pleads, to desperate, chilling effect.2. The Velvet Underground – Venus in Furs (1967)Lou Reed’s stated aim was to invest rock’n’roll with the quality of literature: he never achieved it more successfully than when inspired by Leopold Von Sacher-Masoch’s infamous 1870 novel. A wall of detuned guitar and scraping, droning viola, Venus in Furs is both menacing and hypnotically alluring: a perfect musical embodiment of its subject matter.1. The Rolling Stones – Sympathy for the Devil (1968)Marianne Faithfull’s suggestion that Mick Jagger read Mikhail Bulgakov’s The Master and Margarita may well be the most fortuitous literary recommendation in rock history. The resulting song was fantastic, the malevolence and amorality of Jagger’s lyric amplified by the music: with its samba-derived rhythm and ecstatic whoops, it sounded not ominous but inviting. Moreover, it was timely: the psychedelicised optimism of the summer of love had begun to erode; the world seemed to be getting darker – Jagger pluralised a line about President Kennedy’s assassination to reflect the news of his brother Bobby’s murder – and attitudes were hardening. Sympathy for the Devil was the perfect soundtrack to the curdling of the 60s. Fifty-eight years on, it still sounds incredible.Explore more on these topicsMusicRankedPop and rockFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After making a series of life model poses, she removed a scroll from her vagina and began to read her manifesto. In doing so, Schneemann asked an important question: “What does it mean for a female artist to be both the artist and the life model?” Or as she put it: “Both image and image-maker?”The female nude, as depicted and objectified by the male artist, has dominated western art for centuries. Despite decades of feminist efforts, that interaction between the great male genius and his female model – sometimes muse – remains a subject of perennial fascination. To enter a gallery, or to open a university textbook, is to be confronted with a parade of idealised naked females by male artists from Rubens, Titian and Botticelli to Picasso and De Kooning.To some, Carolee Schneemann’s Interior Scroll was a groundbreaking work – to others, it was tasteless pornographyWhen Gwen John stood in her bedroom in 1909 sketching herself nude, her body reflected in a wardrobe mirror, what was she thinking? At the time, she was in the midst of a passionate, unhappy affair with Auguste Rodin, for whom she frequently posed. To pose for herself, though, was different, not to mention daring. John struggled to be her own muse, as opposed to Rodin’s, but this image shows her free from the male gaze.Like many women, the female body – and what it means to live in it – has preoccupied my thoughts throughout my life. Yoko Ono’s portraits for her series My Mommy Is Beautiful are shot from an angle at which we probably all encounter the female body as infants: looking up at our mothers from below. I was 13 or 14 when I read the poem Standing Female Nude byCarol Ann Duffy, told from the perspective of an artist’s model: “Belly nipple arse in the window light, / he drains the colour from me. / Further to the right, / Madame. And do try to be still.”View image in fullscreenFamiliar angles … Yoko Ono with one of her Mommy Is Beautiful works.Photograph: Evan Agostini/Getty ImagesIts quietly devastating final line – “I say / Twelve francs and get my shawl. It does not look like me” – profoundly shifted my perspective, and is now one of the epigraphs to my novel, Female, Nude. The story follows Sophie, a painter commissioned to make a portrait of a female friend while they are on holiday in Greece, and at the same time embarks on an affair with that friend’s ex-lover. It is through Sophie’s engagement with other female artists, all of whom have made nude self-portraits, that the reader learns about her inner world. The novel is punctuated by vignettes that see Sophie standing in front of these works in different galleries, and at varying stages of her life, addressing each artist directly in imagined conversations about art and the female body.The novel grew from the idea of female nudes created by women, particularly self-portraits. For much of western art history, women did not have access to nude models and, if they were brave enough, had to rely on their own bodies. The work they produced was often met with outrage, dismissal, mockery or indifference. To some, Schneemann’s Interior Scroll was a groundbreaking work reclaiming hundreds of years of historical baggage when it comes to the female nude. To others, it was tasteless pornography. Because when a female artist takes authority over depictions of her nudity, it can only be political. It is always a threat to the status quo. (Schneemann had already got in trouble at art college for painting male nudes, an act that was considered almost as disruptive.)View image in fullscreen‘Officially the first’ … Self-portrait by Paula Modersohn-Becke, 1906.Photograph: IanDagnall Computing/AlamyLike Schneemann, the Indian-Hungarian artist Amrita Sher-Gil would cause a furore at school for wanting to paint nudes. In the end, she was kicked out. Sher-Gil went on to paint herself topless in her 1934 work Self-Portrait As a Tahitian – a tribute to Gauguin, or an appraisal of his colonial male gaze, depending on your outlook. The ruthlessness of Gauguin’s gaze crops up again in the work of Emma Amos, who often used her groundbreaking art to critique the whiteness and maleness of the artistic canon. The Amos “nude” I chose to include in my novel is 1994’s Work Suit, in which she wears Lucian Freud’s naked body like a garment in a statement that is both scathing and satirical. She is asking: “Is this what it means to be a great artist?” Amos, who died in 2020, still hasn’t been given her due.As far as I know, no history of the female nude self-portrait has been published, so I set about compiling my own. Officially, the first was made in 1906, by Paula Modersohn-Becker, and it is this painting that opens the novel. The joy of being a novelist, as opposed to an academic, is that you are able to take liberties. Not for me the debate as to whether Artemisia Gentileschi’s nudes count as self-portraits or not, despite the fact that so many of them quite clearly have her face. She’s in my canon which, as well as Amos, includes performance art, from Interior Scroll to Yoko Ono’s Cut Piece (in which members of the audience cut off pieces of Ono’s clothing). Ana Mendieta’s Silueta series of “earth-body” works also features and as does The Woman of Hohle Fels, a mammoth-ivory carving found in a cave, made 40,000 years ago or more.I looked at photographers, too. Some, like Francesca Woodman, are well known for their depictions of their own bodies. I chose her because her nudes capture the inherent strangeness of living in a young woman’s body, an experience that can feel uncanny, gothic almost, but also erotic, powerful, fraught with irony. Others, such as Anne Brigman, who was making nude photographs of herself in the Californian desert as early as 1907, are still often overlooked. These I included in my canon alongside paintings that are more straightforwardly painterly works of self-portraiture by Alice Neel,Jenny Saville, Gwen John and Suzanne Valadon, as well as contemporary artists such as Lisa Brice.View image in fullscreenCaused a furore … Self-Portrait as a Tahitian by Amrita Sher-Gil.Photograph: AlamyAt one stage in her life, Suzanne Valadon could have been the model in Duffy’s poem. She was, after all, “Renoir’s dancer”, and worked her way out of poverty by modelling for many other renowned artists, observing how they worked and learning from them. She is known for her frank, naturalistic approach to the female nude, and her own Self-Portrait With Naked Breasts, from 1931,is no different. Like Neel’s famous self-portrait, it shows a woman and an artist who has lived, given birth and aged, her face a bit of a scowl, her breasts a fact, not for ogling.Female, Nude by Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett review – a seductive drama of art and rivalryRead moreIt is this refutation of the male gaze that unites many of these nudes, but at the same time each of these artists looks beyond it, engaging with what it means to be a woman who makes art in a body that is also the subject of it. Whether it’s ageing (Alice Neel), motherhood (Louise Bourgeois), disability (Frida Kahlo), race (Emma Amos), sexual desire (Tracey Emin), fluidity (Zanele Muholi) or misogyny (Yoko Ono), these artists have done more than expand the definition of the female nude: they have reinvented it in a way that only they could.To quote Sophie, my protagonist, who is imagining a conversation with Artemisia Gentileschi while standing in front of her Susanna and the Elders, a powerful depiction of misogyny and harassment: “Here I am, you’re saying. Let me show you what a woman can do. Because only a woman could have made this.”Female, Nude by Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is published by Tinder (£18.99).

This smartly wrought and tightly packed production clings to the moments before Russia’s full-scale invasion of the Donbas in 2022, as Braga conjures a bleak microcosm of war in a cramped Ukrainian home.Every element of this sometimes overloaded show works hard, with already high tensions within the household increasing as the external threat of Russian occupation creeps closer. Director Anthony Simpson-Pike makes ambitious use of the small stage in his first show as artistic director, while Niall McKeever’s set feigns simplicity only to rip itself impressively apart when invasion strikes.Dreams are already shattered when we meet our cast. Jack Bandeira stalks the stage as Sashko, a young man with hungry eyes recently released from a Russian jail. Desperate not to give an inch to the invaders, he clashes with his coiled father Seryoga (Philippe Spall), who is willing to stick to Russian rules if it means getting to live. In a play of machismo and squared shoulders – which on occasion devolve into shouting matches – the finest moments are those of small tendernesses. When Sashko asks his father’s Moldovan girlfriend Marianca (played with appeasing warmth by Sasha Syzonenko) to teach him how to correctly pronounce her name, their shoulders sink into each other in a rare moment of intimacy.View image in fullscreenAppeasing warmth … Sasha Syzonenko (right) and Jack Bandeira in Donbas at Theatre503, London.Photograph: Helen MurrayHeritage matters in this house. They speak of “pure-blood” Ukrainians, of neighbours not being welcome because of where they were born, rather than where they have always lived (a jolly Steve Watts and a flirtatious Liz Kettle give a too-brief and much-needed reprieve as kindly neighbours). The play’s urgency is slowed by Sashko’s folkloric stories to calm a neighbour’s silent, watchful granddaughter, while nearby, a gun is trained on the family’s street as Bandeira and Spall double up as soldiers keeping watch in an abandoned house. These secondary characters expand the scope of the play but also stretch its heart; they are somewhat thinly drawn to pack in all the action, with not enough time given to feel individual agony.In Sashko’s stories, he explains what it means to have a good death rather than a wasted one. By depicting the random ugliness of war, Donbas reminds us that this meagre hope is just another story we tell ourselves to get by.AtTheatre503, London, until 28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreUkraineEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Inside the calming Pokémon game that ditches battles for gardeningWe explore the cosy world-building spin-off with Game Freak’s Shigeru Ohmori and his fellow developers – and learn how it began with a Pokémon-hunting dreamTom ReganThu 12 Feb 2026 08.35 ESTLast modified on Thu 12 Feb 2026 11.25 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GooglePokémon iscelebrating its 30thanniversary this month, and everybody knows what to expect from these games by now. The concept is simple: head into a cartoonish paradise full of whimsical creatures, capture them in red-and-white balls and assemble a team of warriors from them, before battling other aspiringPokémonmasters. But the latest entry in the series is different – a game that’s more about building than battling.In Pokopia, a refreshingly pacific twist on the series, players are dropped into a virtual world wherePokémonare freed from their spherical prisons and happily roam their natural habitats. There’s one minor caveat – you have to create those habitats by hand, building them from what you can find.Taking its cues from Nintendo’s all-conqueringAnimal Crossing, this Switch 2 game sees you rebuilding decaying habitats in order to attract new Pokémon to move into your sanctuary. (Players of the Xbox classic Viva Piñata, rejoice.) It’s a welcome departure from the main series’ long-running training and battling loop. Veteran Pokémon developer Shigeru Ohmori, who started thinking about Pokopia’s concept while working on 2022’s Pokémon gamesScarlet and Violet, says that the idea for Pokopia arose after spending many years dreaming about finding Pokémon in tall grass.View image in fullscreen‘A very universal cuteness.’Photograph: Nintendo“The first Pokémon game I worked on was [2003’s] Ruby and Sapphire,” recalls Ohmori with a smile. “My first project for that game was to create the map – and whenever I put grass on to the map, Pokémon appeared on screen. That feeling of Pokémon appearing when creating the habitat, and then meeting those Pokémon, was something that I really cherished.” He created a basic prototype for Pokopia in his spare time, and then Pokémon’s developers Game Freak brought on Dragon Quest Builders 2 studio Omega Force to help.This feeling is lovingly recreated for players in Pokopia. As you create tufts of grass, a Bulbasaur suddenly appears, shuffling his way towards you to say hello. There are no humans to be found anywhere in this virtual utopia. In the strange and initially desolate patch in which you create your Pokémon paradise, you control the adorably wobbling mass of everyone’s favourite shape-shifting jelly, Ditto. Haunted by memories of its former trainer, Ditto decides to take a humanoid shape that you determine in a character creation screen. This is your uncanny-looking avatar, doing its best to approximate a faded memory of a human being.After you’ve customised your Ditto/human-hybrid, you are greeted by a sentient shrub, Professor Tangrowth, complete with a data disc attached to his curly tendrils and a pair of glasses strapped to his chin. The prof informs you that it’s your job to restore this barren land. Where do you begin? In exactly the same way that Ohmori did, all those years ago – by making lush, green grass.View image in fullscreenGrow your own in Pokopia.Photograph: Game Freak/The Pokémon Company/Koei TecmoIn order to create new habitats, Ditto borrows moves from each new creature you meet, mimicking their abilities so that you can till the land. Bulbasaur’s ability transforms Ditto’s appendages into floppy, leaf-producing vines. Squirtle’s water gun sees Ditto puke water like a derpy Roman fountain, and Scyther’s cut blesses Ditto with comically oversized razor-sharp blades for arms. In a nice touch, whenever Ditto learns a new move you’re treated to the classic Pokémon level-up music.For an hour I wander the barren wasteland, working to turn sand into grass and hacking trees for wood. Everything feels effortlessly charming, with a level of care and polish that elevates Pokopia’s opening 60 minutes above the series’ many middling spin-offs. Like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Pokopia also allows you to visit friends’ islands and meet their Poké pals, surfing between lands as a Ditto-Lapras or soaring through the skies in the form of a Dragonite.Marina Ayano, the game’s art director, tells me that she grew up with the franchise – making this something of a dream project. During development, Ayano and the sound director landed on two key words to steer the game’s cutesy and laid-back vibe: “chill and pop”. “Chill is slow and cosy, and pop ensures that everything is colourful … [we wanted] a very universal cuteness,” she says. As I make friends with a Pidgey, build a straw bed for a sleepy Charmander and field a request from an amusingly emo Umbreon who desires a black-painted home, it’s certainly very cute. For Ayano, Pokopia offered a chance to let the cutest Pokémon shine: creatures that are usually cast aside in the mainline games in favour of stronger battlers.View image in fullscreen‘Chill and pop’ … the developers’ key words when building the game.Photograph: Game Freak/The Pokémon Company/Koei TecmoPlaying as a Pokémon rather than the games’ usual human protagonists, you can fully understand – and converse with – every species of Pokémon, and given that Pokémon’s writing is normally pretty bland, the dialogue has unexpected personality. “Because there are no trainers in the game, we really thought about how the Pokémon communicate with each other,” says Takuto Edagawa, Pokopia’s director. “What are they thinking? How are they feeling? We made sure that if you put one piece of furniture anywhere in the world, Pokémon will react based on their personalities. I really liked how it came out.”Pokopia is the first spin-off game that Game Freak has worked on directly, and Ohmori suggests that it may have influenced the direction of future mainline Pokémon games. “Battles have always been the focus, but there are so many [other elements] to these games, and I believe that fans have enjoyed these components as well,” he says. “I would like to show this more and scale the Pokémon games up, outside of battling. And I would like the Pokémon franchise to seek new possibilities to grow the Pokémon world.”Pokopia is released on 5 March; £58.99/$69.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPokémonNintendoNintendo Switch 2Animal CrossingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He explains why the history remains unfinishedBlake SimonsThu 12 Feb 2026 06.10 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleThe so-called “Blue Boy trial” in 1965 was a landmark moment for trans visibility inJapan. Now it has become a landmark film, directed by Kasho Iizuka, a transgender man and one of very few queer film-makers working in the commercial Japanese film industry.View image in fullscreen‘I felt that present-day Japanese people ought to know that these people existed’ … Kasho Iizuka.The original legal caseconcerned a doctor who was prosecuted for performing gender reassignment surgery on transgender women, amid law enforcement frustrations that female-presenting transgender sex workers could not be prosecuted for their profession due to their being legally male. The doctor was found guilty of violating Japan’s eugenics laws, which prohibited surgeries resulting in sterilisation if they were deemed inessential. “Blue Boy”was a slang term for transgender individuals assigned male at birth, and the verdict effectively outlawed gender reassignment surgery in Japan until 1998. Despite this, the case raised the domestic profile of transgender people.“The trial has slipped into obscurity in Japan, but I’ve known about it since I first became aware of my identity,” says Iizuka. “These days in Japan you can hear the term LGBTQ in everyday conversation. Back in the 60s, when no such terms were used, there were still people who bravely lived openly [queer] lives. I felt that present-day Japanese people ought to know that these people existed.”Iizuka made his feature film debut in 2011, but his pitches of transgender stories were for the most part unsuccessful at first. Then later in the decade, films about transgender individuals became something of a trend, with films such as Naoko Ogigami’s Close-Knit and Eiji Uchida’s Midnight Swan shining a spotlight on issues facing trans people. “There was a problem with that trend,” says Iizuka. “Transgender tragedy was used as entertainment, and their existence was depicted in a one-dimensional, othered way.” Nonetheless, the success of these films meant that Blue Boy Trial was greenlit. Distributed by major studio Nikkatsu, it is a landmark Japanese film.View image in fullscreenBlue Boy Trial is touring the UK.Photograph: © 2025 “Blue Boy Trial” Film PartnersUnlike its domestic forebears, which cast cisgender men in archetypal transfeminine roles, Blue Boy Trial features trans actors – many non-professional – in trans roles, and seeks to represent a broad spectrum of experiences. “The characters are equally inspired by present-day transgender women and those of the 1960s,” says Iizuka. There was little archival material to consult, with Iizuka turning to weekly magazines and newspapers to understand the set of characters. “As I researched, I found that transgender women of the 1960s had similarly varied attitudes towards their own identities. Some were open; some treated their trans identity as a secret.”Iizuka says there were significant differences in the way they dealt with society. “Transgender women in 1960s Japan tended to overexpress their femininity to be accepted as women,” he says. “But it was important to us to emphasise the commonality between then and now.”Iizuka and his co-writers grew just as interested in those opposed to trans people, and their deeper research pointed to Japan’s wartime experience as a potential reason for the backlash. “Men should be men, and strong – they internalised these values,” says Iizuka. “I don’t think the blame lies with the individual, I think it was a wider problem.”View image in fullscreen‘The characters are equally inspired by present-day transgender women and those of the 1960s.’Photograph: © 2025 “Blue Boy Trial” Film PartnersIizuka hopes his film will inspire further change, and it’s heartening to see that Blue Boy Trial may not be an isolated case in Japan. A biopic oftransgender TV personality Ai Haruna, This Is I, is currently showing on Netflix. Its director, Yusaku Matsumoto, is not transgender himself, but he consulted queer voices to ensure sensitivity and accuracy. “I do think this is a wave,” says Iizuka. “I’ve received proposals for new projects that would cast transgender actors. There’s momentum.”This cultural momentum is aided greatly by domestic advances in trans rights. In 2023, mandatory sterilisation for trans-identifying individualswas deemed unconstitutional by the Japanese supreme court. “The 2023 rulings were milestones for the transgender community, but we’ve faced a backlash,” says Iizuka. “There have been fears around how we maintain safety for women’s spaces, and there are difficulties around changing gender markers on family registers. We’re in a transitional phase. Blue Boy Trial is my gesture as a transgender artist. I hope this film will help society change in a positive direction.”Blue Boy Trial is at Home, Manchester, as part of the Japan Foundation touring film programme 2026, andtours the UKuntil 26 March.

I didn’t have one of those. It wasn’t until I was 24 and living in Paris, where I stumbled into Philippe’s class almost by accident, that this happened. Provocative, demanding, deliberately inappropriate and utterly hilarious, Philippe taught me not to carry anything. No baggage, no ideas; knowing nothing is all you need. Because we are all ridiculous.His mother was Spanish, and we would eat her meals with relish when she came to cook for him, or rather with him, in hisappartementlined with his writings, many of which had “rêves” inscribed on the spine. He would refer to his father as “ce salaud bourgeois” (that bourgeois arsehole) and he delighted in telling me the story of being thrown out of school aged eight because he punched the gymnastics teacher who was trying to instil discipline into young boys by turning them into military martinets.Of the professions and attitudes that merited his ire – the military, the church, hypocrisy, sham, inauthenticity, politicians, academics and fascists – “collaborateurs” had a special place in his heart. For a boy who grew up in postwar France, this slur was reserved for the most deserving. “C’est un collabo de merde de chien” – a dog-shit collaborator, though that translation does nothing for the pleasurable disgust and gastronomic relish with which he spat these words out from under his moustache.View image in fullscreen‘Moi, je suis le professeur’ … Philippe Gaulier.Photograph: Courtesy of the artistThe moustache, a tangled mass of straggling unruly black wire obscuring the entire region between his nose and his lower lip, was immediately fascinating to me at my first meeting, on a cold November evening in 1980 at his studio in Rue Alfred de Vigny. That, and his pipe clenched tight between his teeth. Then the wild hair, a bright green sagging sweater, ageing boots and eyes (framed by round glasses) that missed nothing, took nothing seriously and ferociously studied every possibility of the hilarious or the pretentious.The room was full of people who didn’t know what to expect but who had heard there was somethingPhilippe Gaulierwas offering you couldn’t get anywhere else.I shook his hand.Pause.Look.“Bonsoir.”“Bonsoir.”Pause.Look.“You arre eeengleesh?”“Yes … er … Oui.”“Tout le monde a des problèmes.”What did he just say? Everyone has problems? Hand still held. Eyes sparkling.Wicked laughter.First lesson.“Moi,” placing his hand on his belly, “moi, je suis le professeur, vous … vous êtes des élèves.”Rules were established. Rules of the game. The game from the outset was that he was the teacher, you were the pupils. The gymnastics teacher was parodied, the relationship of power was offered as a structure to be undermined and shattered with laughter.Philippe Gaulier had a huge impact on theatre – but his ‘embrace the ridiculous’ lesson is one for us allRead moreThere was no style, no set ideas, each person was scrupulously attended to, taken apart, built up again, invited, insulted, cajoled, delighted and, most importantly, played with. He would play with each of us with infinite generosity, stomach-aching hilarity, indefatigable persistence and utterly spontaneous flexibility.We learned to fail, and start again; we learned to jettison our own ideas, because ideas were never the problem, only performing them. When people laugh at you, it reveals a truth, which is why we hate being laughed at in real life. But with Philippe we could learn that failing to embrace this vulnerable sense of exposure was inimical to revealing our humanity.Sharing this fallibility in a complicitous relationship with the audience is a radical act; an anarchic joining to be found in no other art form.“If an actor has forgotten what it is like to play as a child, they should not be an actor,” he would say to me as he took me to the bar in the lunch break before the afternoon session.

Chalamet added: “I did another take, and then the guy said, ‘I was just in jail for 30 years. You really don’t want to fuck with me. You don’t want to see me angry.’ I said to Josh, ‘Holy shit, who do you have me opposite, man?’”The answer was that Safdie had casta non-actor– one of many who have roles inMarty Supreme, a fictionalised homage to the mid-20th century table tennis player Marty Reisman. Similarly, Paul Thomas Anderson used people with no prior acting experience for his comedy action thrillerOne Battle After Another.Safdie and Anderson are following in a long tradition of directors using non-professionals to achieve a level of authenticity based on lived experience and physical presence rather than theatrical technique. It has run the gamut from early Soviet cinema and Italian neorealism to a fleeting appearance byDonald Trump in Home Alone 2.One Battle After Another has marquee names aplenty – Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro, Teyana Taylor – but also a striking cameo by James Raterman, a retired Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security Investigations special agent. Raterman was spotted by Anderson after taking part inThe Trade, a documentary series about the opioid crisis and human trafficking.Despite his lack of acting experience, he threw himself wholly into the role of Colonel Danvers. “It’s a job and you have to work at it,” Raterman says by phone from Columbus, Ohio. “The good thing with myself and Paul is he’s so collaborative. He allowed me with the other actors to pull it off the cuff.“This is one of the best pieces of acting advice that I’ve received and I received it from Mr Anderson. He said, Jim, when you read the script, don’t pay attention to the words on the page; pay attention to what is it that I need you to do at that particular time. Honestly, I could have probably gone to film school and studied for years and years and maybe got that same piece of advice but, coming from somebody like Paul Thomas Anderson, it put you in a different frame of mind.”Raterman has nothing but praise for how the professional actors onOne Battle After Anotherwelcomed him into the fold. “These are amazing A-list actors that have no problem whatsoever taking you under their wing and treating you like a family member and wanting you to elevate in such a way that the whole project gets elevated.View image in fullscreenPaul Grimstad in One Battle After Another.Photograph: Public domain“You never felt like a stranger, you never feel like an outsider and that started at the top.

We laughed, we bonded, made some incredible friendships.”One Battle After Another also featuresPaul Grimstad, a musician, writer and professor of humanities at Yale University. For years he avoided on-camera work following an early part in his roommate Ronald Bronstein’s indie film Frownland. But then Bronstein passed Grimstad’s name to casting director Cassandra Kulukundis, who immediately saw a natural fit with the character Howard Sommerville.Grimstad, 52,told the New York Times newspaperthat “acting was incredibly fun” and said his years as a university lecturer were ideal preparation. “There is an element of verbal performance in teaching. I’m not talking about over-the-top showmanship, but a certain way of animating a book.”Grimstad also appears in Marty Supreme, primarily set in New York during the early 1950s,along with non-actorsincluding the supermarket magnate John Catsimatidis, former basketball players George Gervin and Tracy McGrady, essayist and novelistPico Iyer, playwright David Mamet, fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, Shark Tank regular Kevin O’Leary and French high wire artist Philippe Petit.Catsimatidis, 77, says: “Josh Safdie says he met me or saw me when I was running for mayor in 2013 and I was what you call a New York character and he was looking for characters. Being a New York character, I guess I qualify. The lines that I used are things that I do in real life, so I wasn’t acting: that was me.”He reflects: “I enjoyed it. They worked me to midnight. They did one scene 20 times over. Josh Safdie was a great director. He’s a perfectionist and I appreciate somebody that wants perfection.”Petit, who in 1974 walkedbetween the twin towersof the World Trade Center in New York on a tightrope, says: “Many directors are interested in what I would call the freshness of the non-actors. Very often when you take a non-actor instead of a movie star for a movie, that non-actor doesn’t have the training and some of it could be negative but I also very much like to have a complete newcomer to do something important. It’s sometimes a revelation.”McGrady, 46, who played for teams including the Orlando Magic and Houston Rockets, adds via email: “I think we bring something real. There’s an authenticity that comes from people who’ve lived a different life and bring that energy naturally. For me, I’m just being myself and bringing my own experience to the role. Sometimes that rawness adds something special (hopefully).”Gervin, 73,a former San Antonio Spurs player dubbed the “Iceman”, says: “I met Josh, the director, a few years ago at a card show, and we shook hands and spoke and the next thing I know, I’m getting a call from the studio that Josh would like me to play a role in the movie.”View image in fullscreenJohn Catsimatidis in Marty Supreme.Photograph: Public domainGervin plays Lawrence, the owner of a table tennis parlour in midtown Manhattan. He says of Safdie: “He’s very careful in who he picks. He said, when I met George Gervin, George was so warm that he made me feel that he can run an orphanage. He knows that I have two charter schools so I’m around kids all the time and educate them. Did he take a chance? Probably so but he was in control of what goes in and what goes out and I’m glad he had that kind of confidence in me.”Gervin found that film-making involves long hours. “I went on set at three in the afternoon and didn’t finish till about four in the morning. I wasn’t used to that kind of endurance but it only took me a day to do the little part that I had in the movie. You have a different respect for someone like Timothée, who’s the main character and he was up 12 hours with me. You have to be mentally and physically strong to accomplish what he did. I am truly impressed with what goes into making movies.”Safdie envisioned Lawrence’s club as a safe place for misfits, which was a gift for casting directorJennifer Vendittito study 1950s photographs and tell its story through faces. Her work on Marty Supreme has made the shortlist for the new Oscar category ofbest casting.Venditti, who started street casting 25 years ago when she was in the fashion industry, is a longtime collaborator with both Josh Safdie and his film-maker brother, Benny. She cast the ex-basketball playerKevin Garnettas himself in the Safdies’ 2019 crime thrillerUncut Gems.She says by phone: “One of our signature things is this idea that we are looking to recreate the cinema of life. Sometimes we love actors and characters but sometimes in the pool of actors we can’t find the texture that’s needed to build the authenticity of the world that we’re exploring.”Venditti adds: “We’re always trying to create this alchemy of these incredible actors who know where scenes are going and then these wild people who can add the texture and mystery of they don’t know where the scene’s going and it’s the tension between those two things that creates the excitement in Josh’s films. It’s how we see the world and how we want to see it on screen.”How do established actors generally respond?“At first, if you’re like a very trained actor, it can be alarming in a sense of like, wait, this person’s not following the rules or talking over me. But Josh is such an amazing director that creates such a safe environment, they trust him and they then realise that kind of wildness is lending to their performance.”The process works both ways, Venditti notes. “The scene partner makes these real people good. Timothée is in every scene showing up with his dedication and his focus and his level of mastery. They are so good because they’re in a scene with someone that’s demanding that of them then they rise to meet each other.”The use of non-actors dates back to early Soviet movies such as Sergei Eisenstein’sBattleship Potemkinand October in the 1920s. Italian neorealist films such as Vittorio De Sica’s Bicycle Thieves frequently used non-actors to represent the working class and used post-production dubbing by professional voice actors to ensure clear dialogue and emotional control.Notable US and UK examples include The Best Years of Our Lives, featuring Harold Russell, a second world war veteran who lost both hands;The Killing Fieldswith Haing S Ngor, a Cambodian doctor and genocide survivor with no acting experience; and United 93, in which real flight crew, air traffic controllers and military personnel played themselves.Catherine O’Rawe, author of The Non-Professional Actor: Italian Neorealist Cinema and Beyond and a professor of Italian film and culture at the University of Bristol in Britain, says: “The non-professional is such an interesting figure. It forces us to look at the question of what is acting, what is performance? Is it just standing up and saying a line? What is it that good acting brings? Some of the non-actors, for example, in the films of postwar Italy were not necessarily what we would think of as brilliant actors but had an amazing face that the director loved.”View image in fullscreenYalitza Aparicio in Roma.Photograph: Alfonso Cuarón/APBut the practice has also been controversial. Four-year-oldVictoire Thivisolwon the best actress award at the 1996 Venice Film Festival for her role in Ponette, about a child who has lost her mother. O’Rawe says: “The performance was so affecting that she won this award and the director collected it on her behalf and got booed by the critics and audience because it’s seen as an affront to profession: if a four-year-old can do this then what is the craft of acting worth?”In 2018Yalitza Apariciomade her acting debut in Alfonso Cuarón’s drama Roma, earning a nomination for the Oscar for best actress. O’Rawe comments: “She was a total non-actor and that was a source of great fascination among the press but sometimes people are a bit uncomfortable that someone with no training can actually be nominated for awards because then for professional actors it can mean, well, why have we spent our lives training and doing all this performance study if somebody can just walk off the streets and win an Oscar?”But these accidental stars often find it impossible to build a lasting career. They can be propelled into the spotlight at theOscarsonly to be left without a safety net once the production cycle ends. The industry may fall in love with an “unspoiled” face for a single project, but it rarely offers the infrastructure needed to turn a singular moment of authenticity into a profession.O’Rawe reflects: “These debates have gone on and they come back at different times but there is always this undercurrent of both the resentment and also that the industry might love these people once but they’re not going to support them.“There are so many cases of these actors who after one big moment, sometimes even winning an award, will find that they can’t get jobs because they’re not trained, don’t have any contacts in the film industry or don’t have any agents or managers or people looking after them. It can be very difficult to build or sustain a career.”Explore more on these topicsOscars 2026OscarsOne Battle After AnotherAwards and prizesMarty SupremefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The prize “brings his real award total to zero”, he joked.“All he wants is awards and for everything to be named after him,” he continued. “The Kennedy Center, Dulles airport, Penn Station – I mean, if that’s the way to keep him happy, I have another suggestion for something we could name after him. And it’s big, and I’ll think he’ll like it, because it’s something that everyone is talking about. It’s something that he actually, unlike most everything else he wants named after him, deserves to be a part of.”The host proposed adding his name to the Epstein files – “or, with your cooperation and the cooperation of others, will heretofore be known as the Trump-Epstein files”.Jimmy Kimmel on Trump: ‘A code orange de-mental emergency going on here right now’Read moreKimmel then tore into the files, which have become the defining albatross around theTrump administration’s neck. Though the US justice department accidentally published many of the victims’ names, it has also redacted many Epstein co-conspirators, including the US president, who reportedly appears in the files about 1m times.“And that doesn’t even include the 3m pages they still haven’t released,” Kimmel reminded. “Which obviously puts Maga in a bit of a fix. Popping up a million times obviously isn’t a positive for the Pizzagate party. So now they’re grabbing at anything they can,” including a document that says when authorities were closing in on Epstein for the first time in 2006, Trump called the police chief in Palm Beach, Florida and said: “Thank goodness you’re stopping him, everyone has known he’s been doing this.”“And that’s the evidence theywantpeople to see right now,” Kimmel marveled.The ongoing saga of the Epstein files was the talk of Capitol Hill on Wednesday, where Bondi appeared unrepentant before a congressional panel. Bondi refused to apologize to several Epstein victims present in the gallery, but did accuse multiple lawmakers, including Republican Thomas Massie of Kentucky, of suffering from “Trump Derangement Syndrome”.“Yes, the ultra-conservative congressman from Kentucky who endorsed Trump three times has ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’,” Kimmel responded. “Trump himself, the man who tweeted the Obamas as monkeys the other day? Solid as a rock. Everyone else is deranged.“I mean, seriously, there’s nothing to defend here,” he continued. “This Department of Justice is hiding the names of people who were not victims. Why are they doing that? If they have nothing to hide, why are they hiding names? That’s it. That’s the only question anybody needs to ask.“It’s maddening,” he concluded. “It is a brazen cover-up.”The Daily ShowAnd on the Daily Show, Jordan Klepper savored a particularly cringeworthy moment from the Winter Olympics, when the Norwegian skier Sturla Holm Lægreid won the bronze medal in the men’s 20km biathlon and thenadmitted, in a viral post-race interview, that he had cheated on his girlfriend of six months. “It has been the worst week of my life,” he said, in a plea to win her back.“I would’ve gone with a ‘thank you, mom and dad’ or a ‘thank you, God’, but instead you went with ‘guess what, world, I can’t keep it in my pants,’” Klepper laughed.“You know what, if repairing your six-month situationship is that important, I guess it’s fine to hijack the news cycle to talk about it. I’m sure your teammate who won the gold had nothing more important to draw attention to.”In fact, it was a very emotional win for fellow Norwegian Johan-Olav Botn. Botn dedicated his gold medal to their late teammate Sivert Guttorm Bakken, whodied unexpectedlyin December. “Oh right, our dead teammate! I was between honoring him or talking about how much pussy I was getting,” Klepper joked. “Dude, come on! You hijacked that to try to win back your fling? This is basically like if instead of interrupting Taylor Swift, Kanye had interrupted the in memoriam segment.”Later in the segment, Klepper touched on Bondi’s vituperative appearance before Congress. “You’d be in a bad mood too if you spent the last month redacting old man genitals from the Epstein files,” he joked. Bondi, who reacted angrily to any questions from lawmakers, “acted like a bratty senior who got called into the principal’s office”.“Her performance upset a lot of people, because they were hoping for justice for Jeffrey Epstein’s victims,” he noted. “But for Pam Bondi, there’s only one victim in all of this.”That would be Donald Trump. Bondi repeatedly called for public apologies to the man she also called “the greatest president in American history” as well as “themost transparent president in the nation’s history”.Klepper was not impressed: “If you’re going to embarrass yourself on national television like that, at least win a bronze medal first.”Explore more on these topicsLate-night TV roundupJimmy KimmelTV comedyComedyTelevisionTrump administrationPam BondifeaturesShareReuse this content"

No movie has really changed any politician’s idea, but … we can change the idea that people have of how they should live.”Fielding a pointed question aboutGerman support for Israel during the Gaza warand “selective” solidarity with besieged peoples around the world, Wenders pushed back at the notion that the film industry or thefestival should actively take political stances.“We have to stay out of politics because if we make movies that are dedicatedly political, we enter the field of politics,” he said. “But we are the counterweight of politics, we are the opposite of politics. We have to do the work of people, not the work of politicians.”Polish producer Ewa Puszczyńska, a member of Wenders’s jury, called the question’s framing “unfair”.“Of course, we are trying to talk to people and make them think, but we cannot be responsible for what their decision would be, to support Israel or to support Palestine,” she said.“There are many wars where genocide is committed, and we do not talk about them … so this is a complicated question and it’s a bit of an unfair question.”The seven-member panel will choose from among 22 features from around the world for the Golden and Silver Bear top prizes, to be awarded at a gala ceremony on 21 February.The festival will open with No Good Men by Shahrbanoo Sadat, billed asAfghanistan’s first romcom, screening out of competition.The event, now in its 76th year, will roll out the red carpet forstars showing new workincluding Amy Adams, Channing Tatum, Pamela Anderson, Ashley Walters, Callum Turner, Ethan Hawke, Gemma Chan and Charli xcx.But the bulk of the approximately 200 feature films and documentaries in the Berlinale programme place the accent on the impact of geopolitical tumult and rights struggles around the world, Wenders noted.“Cinema has an incredible power of being compassionate and empathetic,” he said. “The news is not empathetic. Politics is not empathetic, but movies are. And that’s our duty.”The Berlinale ranks with Cannes and Venice among Europe’s top film festivals.Explore more on these topicsBerlin film festivalWim WendersFestivalsEuropeGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

Judicious counter-programming comes courtesy of children’s animation GOAT and murky drama Crime 101.Wuthering Heights continues studio Warner Bros’ impressive streak at the box office, following a 2025 slate that included A Minecraft Movie, Final Destination Bloodlines and Weapons. The studio, which is now fielding takeover bids from Netflix and Paramount, also boasts the two key contenders at this year’s Oscars: Sinners and One Battle After Another.Sinners broke the record for Academy Award nominations, with 16, while its rival remains favourite to take the best picture and director prizes. Both films have also proved lucrative, despite their considerable budgets: Ryan Coogler’s supernatural thriller is now on $369m (£270m), while Paul Thomas Anderson’s countercultural comedy has taken $208m (£152m).View image in fullscreenRobbie and Elordi at the Australian premiere of the film.Photograph: Nadir Kinani/AAPWuthering Heights is Fennell’s third film as writer-director, following 2020’s Promising Young Woman, starring Carey Mulligan as a woman who takes revenge on the men who assaulted her friend, and Saltburn (2023), a provocative spin on Brideshead Revisited, starring Barry Keoghan as an Oxford student who becomes obsessed with a much wealthier fellow student, played byJacob Elordi.Promising Young Woman won Fennell the original screenplay Oscar, while Saltburn became a watercooler hit for streamer Amazon. Wuthering Heights reunites her with Elordi (as Heathcliff) as well as Saltburn producerMargot Robbie, who plays Catherine in the new film.Fennell has stressed that the adaptation, which takes considerable liberties with Emily Brontë’s source novel, is a personal interpretation of the book, inspired by her feelings about it when she first encountered it as a teenager.Reviews have been mixed, with many US pundits praising its ambition and idiosyncrasies, while UK critics have in the main been more sceptical.In his two-star review, the Guardian’s Peter Bradshawcalledit “a 20-page fashion shoot of relentless silliness, with bodices ripped to shreds and a saucy slap of BDSM”.Disquiet has already been voiced over the film’s intentional anachronisms, as well as the casting of Robbie and Elordi, both of whom are considerably older than the characters in the novel. Elordi’s casting met with further backlash as Heathcliff is most commonly described by Brontë as “dark-skinned”.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryWarner BrosWuthering HeightsEmerald FennellMargot RobbieJacob ElordiShareReuse this content"

Long before he became a film-maker, the teenage Crowe travelled around the US interviewing some of the biggest rocks acts of the era, among them Gram Parsons, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, the Eagles and the Allman Brothers Band. Crowe’s memoir reveals him as the perennial outsider who, unlike his interviewees, cared little about sex, booze and drugs and who lacked a certainsavoir-faire. Yet rock stars liked having him around, enjoying his sincerity and the fact that he was more admiring fan than dispassionate reporter.Crowe is the reader, delivering a warm and vivacious narration that conveys the wide-eyed astonishment of his youthful self as he is thrust into the orbit of his heroes. He also paints a vivid picture of an era in which bands weren’t protected by gaggles of PR representatives and a writer could spend 18 months with an artist – as Crowe did with Bowie in the mid-1970s – to write a single profile.The book draws to a close shortly after Crowe conducts a filmed interview with Tom Petty. With the video director gone awol, Petty instructs Crowe to pick up the camera and start shooting. In doing so, Crowe stumbles on what turns out to be his ideal medium: “I’d been a music journalist, translating time and space for others to savour. This was an exercise in cutting out the middleman.

A 63-year-old gay philosophy teacher and drag entertainer, he is a stickler for rules and boundaries, living in a tiny Beirut flat with his octogenarian mother, the nosy and unfettered Zalfa. Invited to a writing residency in the US, Raja will use the occasion to relate his life – that is, if you don’t mind him taking the scenic route. “A tale has many tails, and many heads, particularly if it’s true,” Raja tells us. “Like life, it is a river with many branches, rivulets, creeks and distributaries.”Winner of the 2025 US National Book Award for fiction, Alameddine’s seventh novel opens and closes in 2023, but the bulk of its action takes place earlier: encompassing the lead-up to and aftermath of the Lebanese civil war (1975-1990), the Covid pandemic, Lebanon’s 2019 banking crisis, and the Beirut port explosion in 2020. If this timeline makes the book sound like a punishing tour of Lebanese history, I promise it isn’t. More than a war chronicle or national exposé, it is a queer coming-of-age tale, an exploration of the bond between a mother and a son, and a meditation on storytelling, memory, survival and what it means to be truly free. Told in a voice as irresistibly buoyant as it is unapologetically camp, this rule-breaking spin on the trauma plot holds on to its cheer in the face of sobering material. Poignant but never cynical, often dark but never dour, wise without being showy and always eager to crack a joke, this is a novel that insists that the pain of the past need overwhelm neither present nor narrative, identity nor personality. With Sartre as his guide, and a drag fabulousness all his own, Raja shows us how.This rule-breaking spin on the trauma plot holds on to its cheer in the face of sobering materialThe banking collapse and the Covid pandemic are both played as comedies. The former sees an outraged Zalfa taking to the streets as a protest icon: braving teargas, brandishing homemade signs (“This Grandmother Wants All the Brothers of Whores in Jail”) and achieving, to Raja’s consternation, celebrity among his students.When the pandemic arrives, Zalfa finds herself home and bored and, worse still, barred from guest appearances in Raja’s Zoom classes. Zalfa needs people; she needs stories; she needs to be listened to. Who better as a friend, then, than Madame Taweel, the neighbourhood mafia boss and inexhaustible source of gossip? The two become inseparable confidantes, bonding over everything from makeup to low-budget films starring Raja in drag, while Madame Taweel’s armed minions politely stand guard outside.Raja being Raja, of course, does not tell the tale of their friendship straight, prefacing it with a long, only tenuously related tale of his own from 40 years earlier, about a secret lover he had during the war: “Mansour was handsome, hirsute, and hung – very well hung. I rode that beast as often as I could.”The section set before the civil war trades farce for a measured account of Raja’s boyhood, as in a series of scenes – some funny and others heartbreaking – we see him fail familial expectations of masculinity. The home of a Japanese neighbour offers refuge from the chaos and hostility of Raja’s own and opens a window on to a culture he grows to cherish for its order and minimalism.The novel’s bravura centrepiece returns to a memory Raja has long repressed: his captivity during the war at the hands of Boodie, a militiaman just a year older. Fifteen at the time, Raja witnesses a kidnapping that ends in bloodshed; Boodie takes him along to spare his life. Over two months, an ordeal Raja later calls both “horrific” and “exhilarating”, his senses of danger and safety, powerlessness and agency, terror and desire are thoroughly scrambled. Boodie is by turns caring and coercive, violent and tender, and the sex they have provokes in Raja a conflicted mix of shame and joy. The narrative refuses to resolve these contradictions, staging the episode almost as a twisted domestic drama with notes of slapstick.In the novel’s penultimate pages, Raja rejects the label of trauma (“I felt free in that situation. Maybe even happy”), while also refusing the closure of forgiveness. It is not that he cannot forgive Boodie, he says, but that he chooses not to. “I wasn’t hurt because he kept me hostage. I was hurt because I realised I couldn’t participate in a system that seeks to destroy people like us.” Boodie chose to participate in a murderous system: “From the beginning, he chose war.” If anything, what proved traumatic was Raja’s return to a world incapable of accepting him: when he finally managed to escape, he did so, alas, in a dress. Everyone turned away from him except Zalfa.Sartre held, not uncontroversially, that we are condemned to be free: even the worst setbacks and threats we face acquire significance only through our own “project”, the way we commit to being in the world. Raja seems to take this as his mantra. The True True Story of Raja the Gullible (And His Mother) conveys one message compellingly, and it is this simple but radical one: you cannot change what happened. But you can maybe, just maybe, decide what it means.The True True Story of Raja the Gullible (and His Mother) by Rabih Alameddine is published by Corsair (£22).

But her long shot of a movie landed her the opening slot at theBerlin film festivalstarting Thursday, sending her in the red-carpet footsteps of the likes ofMartin Scorseseand theCoen brothers.Sadat, 35, wrote, directed and stars in the daring, genre-bending film No Good Men, about a budding love affair in a Kabul newsroom on the eve of theTaliban’s return to powerin 2021 and thewest’s chaotic withdrawal.During the years-long gestation of the picture, Sadat found herself stranded on a writing retreat in Germany by the pandemic, then witnessing the febrile last days of democracy inAfghanistan. Finally, she was evacuated to Europe in fear for her life as Kabul fell to the Taliban.She said those tumultuous years in and out of her homeland shaped the kind of movie she wanted to make – paying tribute to women and men finding joy and connection despite tumult, violence and repression.View image in fullscreen‘Afghanistan is always misrepresented by international film-makers’ … No Good Men by Shahrbanoo Sadat (right).Photograph: Virginie Surdej“Afghanistan doesn’t have a film industry and it’s always misrepresented by the films that are being made by international film-makers. The only type of film-making that is expected is a war drama,” she said in a video call from Hamburg where she has resettled.Sadat said that disconnect set her on a unique path as an Afghan director, one that embraced fun and even frank sexuality running counter to western stereotypes. “My life is not a war drama every day. There’s a lot of humour and a lot of comedy. And at the time I began I was with my boyfriend, so there was romance,” she said. “Afghanistan is also like the rest of the world so I decided,you know what, I’m going to make a romcom.”In the film, Sadat plays Naru, the only camerawoman at Kabul’s main TV station, who is separated from her cheating husband and struggling to keep custody of her three-year-old son.At work, Naru is kept from covering hard news until she makes the most of a Valentine’s Day feature she is assigned, capturing women’s unvarnished views about the men in their lives. The station’s most prominent journalist, Qodrat, recognises her talent and begins taking her out in the field. Together they capture the last moments of relative freedom in the city.As they crisscross Kabul, a spark catches between them and Naru starts to question whether it’s really true there are no good men in Afghanistan. “It is really, really difficult to be a good man in Afghan society,” Sadat said. “You get bullied, you get mocked by all the other men who share the same mentality: that women are animals and you have to take control and you have to be the boss, every woman in your family should be afraid of you.”Sadat said depictions on screen almost exclusively reflected that “monster” image. “And I thought: I’m going to make a film which is going to be like a love letter to all these good men I know.”Sadat aimed to depict an urban woman much like herself: strong-willed, financially self-sufficient and chafing at the indignities imposed on her by an ultraconservative tribal society.She also wanted to push back against a tendency to “romanticise the era of democracy” by “putting 100% of blame on the Taliban” for women’s oppression while ignoring the underlying patriarchal structures that endured during the western occupation. “Being a strong woman is not enough if the system doesn’t support you.”In one uproarious scene, an Afghan friend visiting from the US gives Naru a sex toy as a present to celebrate her newfound freedom as a single woman – certainly a first in the history of Afghan cinema. Sadat said she believes a passionate onscreen kiss shared by Naru and Qodrat is also unprecedented.For an Afghan audience, Sadat jokes those kinds of brazen images will make it a “horror film, not a romcom”. But she is confident that despite official censorship and traditional values, Afghans will seek the film out, even if they have to watch it in bits and pieces on TikTok.View image in fullscreenFilm-maker Shahrbanoo Sadat.Photograph: Alexandra PolinaNo Good Men is the third feature by Sadat, who was born in Tehran and moved with her family to a village in central Afghanistan when she was 12. Her debut Wolf and Sheep picked up an award at Cannes in 2016.She said European film institutes were initially reluctant to back No Good Men as a comedy “while brave Afghan women are fighting in the streets of Kabul against the Taliban – like, ‘how dare you?’”.“And I was like, what? I am one of those women and I want to make something and you’re standing against me. How dareyou? I actually feel offended that you feel offended by my project. So it was really kind of comedy itself. A tragicomedy.”She managed to cobble together funding from across Europe and filmed No Good Men in Germany, where she has a temporary visa, using an all-Afghan cast.Berlin film festival directorTricia Tuttlehandpicked No Good Men as the opener of the 76th edition, passing the mantle from some of the world’s top auteurs. Tuttle called Sadat “one of the most exciting voices in world cinema,” noting she “risked so much to get this film made”.Explore more on these topicsBerlin film festival 2026Comedy filmsAfghanistanTalibanWorld cinemaBerlin film festivalFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The exquisitely beautiful, mercurial and prodigiously talented 90s singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley was drawn to the music business. And this contractually demanded endless touring and a multi-album commitment when he’d already poured his twentysomething-year-old life and soul intothe first one, Grace, a hipster-critical smash whose commercial underperformance in the US caused execs to push him ever harder for a follow-up to recoup their investment. The business also created a world where he got to meet his heroes (such as Paul McCartney and Robert Plant), whose extravagant, good-natured praise for him sent this already highly strung young soul over the edge. He was as handsome as Jim Morrison in his sleek prime as well as – to my eye – Adam Ant with a touch of Neil Innes.Amy Berg’s arresting documentary of a death foretold explains how young Jeff and his mother were abandoned when he was an infant by his father,Tim Buckley,a singer and counterculture figure who was to die of a heroin overdose in his late 20s. Jeff was to die at about the same age, in an accidental drowning in Wolf River Harbor, Memphis, Tennessee, in 1997, when he was just 30.His high-spirited mum was in many ways the great love of his life – but it was singing at his dad’s memorial service that astonished the congregation and kickstarted Jeff’s career; he was a superb vocalist with a range and delicacy inspired by Nina Simone and Judy Garland. He was poignantly the very image of his dad; the press treated him like a cover version of his father, and his early dependence on cover versions such asLeonard Cohen’s Hallelujahundermined the development of original material.Berg speaks extensively to his mum, Mary Guibert – the film’s executive producer – and to two of his girlfriends, Rebecca Moore and Joan Wasser. She uses Jeff’s answering machine messages and archive 90s material, including the unmistakable, moody black-and-white MTV footage, to tell a very sad story with sympathy and urgency.It’s Never Over,Jeff Buckleyis in UK and Irish cinemas from 13 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsMusic documentaryJeff BuckleyPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

InSweet Mambo, the German choreographer’s 2008 production for Tanztheater Wuppertal, their eclectic compilation complements the seductive elegance of set designer Peter Pabst’s huge, billowing white drapes and the sumptuous gowns provided byMarion Cito.Track by track, an entrancing through-line is found in Sámi joiking, torch song, folk, electronica and ambient music. The mix extends to the unclassifiable party sound ofHazmat Modine’s Bahamut, harmonicas and tuba boosting a late burst of loosey-goosey abandon from dancer Daphnis Kokkinos while his colleagues are wrapped and spun upside down in those curtains.View image in fullscreenPop art poses … Julie Shanahan, centre, with Daphnis Kokkinos and Alexander López Guerra.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAn altogether more serene opening bids us to listen closely as Naomi Brito, a dancer who gets better and better, plays a golden singing bowl. Andrey Berezin is duly drawn on stage, moth to her flame. Men pestering women, attraction and repulsion, were lifelong Bausch motifs and made for some hard-to-stomach scenes but here he is swatted gently away before Brito’s beatific solo, with long, silky lines and a luxurious full flow. It sums up the softer edges of Sweet Mambo, where the women’s solos frequently have an inner stillness and the dancers even drift away in hammocks.The handful of harrowing episodes mostly involve Julie Shanahan, who enters caressing herself and adopting stylised poses à la Roy Lichtenstein’s pop art that morph into supernatural malevolence. Later, she is caught in a vicious circle of locked then liberated movement. In a reprised sequence, she strives to reach the end of the stage, repeatedly carried back to the start by men with implacable expressions – either acting dutifully or cruelly. The scenes with Julie Anne Stanzak dragged around the stage by her hair equally evade clearcut definition: it is done at her request and, as they run in circles and a storm rages, the sense is that we are all in this mess together and need each other.View image in fullscreenA dancer who gets better and better … Naomi Brito.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBut Sweet Mambo is also one of Bausch’s funniest shows: Nazareth Panadero, blissfully daft, laughs into a plastic bag and seals it for later use then delivers eccentric aphorisms and tall tales about her neighbour’s parrot. “I feel so empty,” she laments, brandishing a used water-cooler bottle. Berezin returns to a sequence suggesting a helpless plummet through air and this void is at the heart of Pabst’s masterly minimalist design as gusts fill and sculpt a diaphanous sheet, with solos performed inside or adjacent.The sound of Pina BauschRead moreThe billowing backdrop becomes a screen for a projected 1930s German film featuring suave actors but, really, with dancers like this who needs to be distracted by other performers? After the interval, replaying selected routines risks diminishing returns yet the work has concentrated unity – it’s less sprawling than some of the choreographer’s other pieces – and results in a swooningly beautiful night.Pina Bauschcoinciding with Valentine’s Day is a Sadler’s Wells tradition and these dancers treat the audience like lovers, asking us to never forget them, tell them our problems, help them unzip a dress.

It is a tragedy of opportunism, of a moment of hubris that spins out of control. For a while, it could go either way.That comes across in this staging, directed by Mark Babych in a three-way co-production withBolton OctagonandDerby theatre. Macbeth strides on, fresh from the battlefield, a modern-day soldier with camouflage colours and an automatic weapon. Played by Oliver Alvin-Wilson, he is as tough as his country needs him to be: serious-minded and professional, but not self-seeking.The idea he might be more than a regular fighter enters him like a poison. Foretold to him by the witches – mix-and-match eccentrics somewhere between rough sleepers and zombies – the prospect of kingship sounds odd and uncomfortable. The taste of ambition is new to him; he swithers this way and that, and it is not inevitable that hunger for power will become his defining characteristic. Then it takes root.View image in fullscreenAs bad as each other … Jo Mousley and Oliver Alvin-Wilson in Macbeth at Hull Truck theatre.It is the same with Jo Mousley as Lady Macbeth. Appearing in a maroon jumper and blue opal necklace, she has a suburban plainness, an ordinary woman thinking on her feet. Like her husband, she comes and goes. When the two of them hatch their murderous plot, they take turns buckling and cajoling, equivocal one moment, certain the next. They are as bad – and as good – as each other. They are well matched.Far from being born tyrants, these Macbeths are an everyday couple taking their chances. The banquet scene looks less like a state dinner than a light supper in a mews apartment, complete with lounge-jazz accompaniment. This could happen to anyone.If Lady Macbeth’s sudden madness has any justification (as ever, it is a little odd), it is that she is out of her depth.

Dashing out the brains of babies is so much bravado.Performed on a rusty warehouse set designed by Rachael Canning, this GCSE-friendly production is lucid and straightforward.

Whereas on this stage, six men send up Bausch’s choreography and signature style, skewering its cliches. Not that everyone in the audience will know the reference. If you’re not a regular dance-goer, you may just see a bunch of men in long flowing gowns processing around the stage and flinging their long wigs about. But still entertaining.A lot of Tutu, after all, is just about raising mirth through silly dancing and silly costumes. All-male comedy dance company Chicos Mambo, directed by French choreographer Philippe Lafeuille, have been performing this show for more than a decade, and it seems to be a camp crowd-pleaser. Certainly the costumes are fun: puffy, flamingo-coloured tutu trousers, like a cross between a powder puff and a frilly toilet roll cover; hats that look like vegetables (Why? Why not!).Much like that other all-male troupe the Trocks, a lot of the material comes from a gently mocking but deep love of dance. Swan Lake’s cygnets become daffy ducks in dumpy costumes, putting a bit of disco into Tchaikovsky. You’ve got some Sleeping Beauty, some earnest Euro-contemporary dance soundtracked by the dancers’ breath (bad breath, it turns out, that’s the joke). There’s a Dirty Dancing skit, complete with Swayze’s swivel hips, a ticklish armpit and, yes, the lift.View image in fullscreenCurious surprises … Chicos Mambo: Tutu at Sadler’s Wells East.Photograph: Sandro OliveiraThere are a few curious surprises too. Tutu is a study in contrasts – Bach’s Goldberg Variations mixed with the haka, for example. The dancers rinse a few laughs out of men hobbling on pointe shoes, but then Vincenzo Veneruso dances a rather beautiful solo, on pointe. There’s a scene with the six men as babies in nappies, tottering, nose-picking and bum-shuffling to the fierce, slicing chords of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring. (Because it’s a kind of fertility ritual? Or just because it’s the most random, unlikely thing you could set to that legendary music?)It’s amusingly done, clever in parts, nonsense in others; it’s tightly choreographed larking about. But you do find yourself asking, is there more to this joke? Then again, a few rows ahead, a child of maybe seven or eight (who I’m assuming has never heard of Pina Bausch) is in absolute hysterics from start to finish.AtSadler’s Wells East, London, until 15 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsDanceTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Sadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But it’s also worth noting its positive effects: how TikTok users can make improbable tracks from pop history go viral; how social media can transform the fortunes of an artist who probably wouldn’t have got past a record company’s reception in our current, risk-averse era.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for The Apple Tree Under the Sea.Which brings us to North Carolina’s Isimeme Udu, better known as Hemlocke Springs, who rose to fame posting homemade videos of her songs on TikTok. There’s always a chance that a label might have gone all in on a bespectacled 27-year-old former librarian fond of neon-coloured wigs, purveying “awkward Black girl anthems” via a lo-fi take on 80s-influenced synth pop, but you wouldn’t bet on it. Self-released, her tracks have racked up millions of streams and attracted the attention ofDoja CatandChappell Roan, both of whom took her on tour: cue a video of Springs supporting Roanat New York’s Forest Hills stadium last autumn, performingGirlfriendwhile most of the 13,000-capacity audience sings along.It’s a heartwarming success story – a DIY artist succeeding thanks to geeky, home-brewed originality and the maddening catchiness of her melodies – or at least it is up to a point. Online virality tends to be predicated on novelty, and it’s in the nature of novelty to wear off. The obvious question that hangs over Springs’ debut album is whether it can translate one form of success into another, more familiar and lasting. But The Apple Tree Under the Sea suggests that straightforward mainstream success isn’t what Hemlocke Springs wants.Like her previous singles, the album is self-released (via label services company Awal). You can tell. Were a major label involved, one suspects they might have steered her towards something less idiosyncratic. Something closer in tone, perhaps, to the tracks that got her noticed, than this concept album about her upbringing as the child of devoutly Christian Nigerian parents, replete with songs decrying their homeland’s deeply rooted cultural practice of arranged marriage (“I would rather kill myself than look him in the eyes and say I want your love,” she sings onw-w-w-w-w), or which invoke God using the ancient Hebrew name El Shaddai. They would probably have ensured more familiar names appeared in the songwriting credits – the album is a collaboration between Springs and Burns, an English EDM producer best known for cowriting a handful of tracks on Lady Gaga’sChromatica– and might well have done their best to smooth out the album’s sound into something more homogenous.As it is, you lurch from brash electronics to pop-dance to 80s metal guitars to music that, with its massed staccato vocals, has something of the show tune about it; from a piano ballad and pizzicato strings to music that variously recalls Prince, Stevie Nicks and Britney Spears. All these variations take place in the space of three songs.Hemlocke Springs: Sever the Blight – video.There are points where this fidgety, swipe-right eclecticism can get a bit exhausting, compounded by the apparently infinite malleability of Springs’ voice, which can go from raw and apparently untutored to mannered and carefully enunciated in the blink of an eye. But equally, there are points where it works to head-spinning effect, as onSever the Blight– where a Kate Bush-evoking intro gives way to a burst of dramatic film-soundtrack synths, which are replaced by crisp electronic pop – or Moses, which shifts from a gospel-ish choir to an ominous bass tone to a fantastic pop chorus. The latter feels key: even at its most scattered, the music here is invariably tethered to precisely the kind of well-crafted earworms that marked out Springs’ online breakthrough. Meanwhile, the lyrics are never less than intriguing. “I wonder who’s walking around with fertiliser and amplifying all the tension in her head,” she sings onHead, Shoulders, Knees and Ankles, a line that she rhymes with “the tenebrous festered corners of your bed”.‘Fame is like going through puberty’: Chappell Roan on sexuality, superstardom and the joy of dragRead moreThe stuff that most resembles her breakthrough hits – such as a wonky take on something you could imagine the characters in Stranger Things jamming out to in their downtime – is all sequestered at the album’s end: in fairness, the whole thing is over in barely 30 minutes, but you still feel like you’ve travelled quite a long distance to get there. Again, a major label might have had something to say about structuring an album like that, and more fool them. Springs’ approach is appealingly assured: this is what I want to do, this is who I am, take it or leave it. It’s an approach that sometimes produces mainstream fame – you can see a similar intractability in Chappell Roan – but is more likely to result in cult success. And that, one suspects, is exactly the aim here, in which case: job done.This week Alexis listened toSofia Kourtesis - Los Poemas No Siempre RimanA perfect counterpart to the relentless grey misery of February: a house collaboration with Afro-Peruvian band Novalima that exudes warmth and joy without slipping into cliche.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

That’s a shame, as it possesses emotional depth as well as a swag of memorable arias. Contemporary audiences gave it a warm welcome, though the composer’s last-minute attempt to avoid a diplomatic faux pas by switching settings from medieval Portugal to mythical Lydia hasn’t helped its reputation.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Handel: SosarmeThis lightly sprung performance from Opéra Royal de Versailles under conductor Marco Angioloni goes some way to rehabilitating the work, even if the engineered sound and edgy string tone are a little in-your-face. Rémy Brès-Feuillet is honey-toned in the title role, originally a vehicle for the great contralto castrato Senesino, with Sarah Charles suitably soubrettish as his beloved Elmira.Doubling as vocalist, Angioloni devours a great deal of scenery as the rancorous king of Lydia alongside fine performances from Nicolò Balducci as his rebellious son and Éléonore Pancrazi as his hapless wife. Crowning the set as the duplicitous counsellor Altomaro is young Italian bass Giacomo Nanni. His sonorous account of “Fra l’ombre e gl’orrori”, a classic case of Handel repurposing an earlier hit, reveals a voice of impressive suppleness and power.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicGeorge Frideric HandelOperareviewsShareReuse this content"

Languorous strings and woodwind indulged in voluptuous foreplay, spurred on by priapic brass, only to fall back repeatedly as if momentarily sated. Benjamin exerted an impressive control over his vast forces – nine horns, no less – refining the composer’s unrestrained textures before ramping up the adrenaline for a climactic explosion of hedonistic pleasure.He brought a similar crystalline clarity to Stravinsky’s Symphonies of Wind Instruments, highlighting its startling modernity as if dissecting the fleshless remnants of a deconstructed The Rite of Spring. The LPO, impressive throughout, laid bare the score with the exactitude of a surgeon’s knife. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Ravel’s Mother Goose was presented complete rather than in the usual suite form, every detail cleanly defined. The rarely heard connecting sections were of special interest as Benjamin led the way from Sleeping Beauty’s graceful pavane to the flirtatious chuntering of Beauty and the Beast, the latter burbling away on a delightfully ungainly contrabassoon. The pentatonic tinkling of the Empress of the Pagodas and the throbbing intensity of The Fairy Garden brought the music to its iridescent conclusion.A palimpsest is a manuscript on which one or more later texts have been inscribed on top of an original piece of writing. It’s an idea that could be applied to a great deal of Benjamin’s own work as a composer, making Palimpsest I and its darker cousin, Palimpsest II signature works. An unconventional orchestral layout – eight basses but no cellos, harps, celesta, a large brass section and an ethereal group of upper strings that sounded at times as if they were on helium – makes these unusually visual pieces, their inner workings revealed most effectively in live performance. Benjamin was authoritative here, crafting the music’s tectonic shifts while bringing out its startling peculiarities and rare beauty.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicLondon Philharmonic OrchestraGeorge BenjaminreviewsShareReuse this content"

Our first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, famously likened India to a palimpsest, no layer quite effacing the one that went before. That’s how I think of Indian railway journeys. They inscribe on the mind our fellow travellers, our ways, our thousand languages, our landscapes, our climate.I think of a rail journey I made in 1998 – that brutal summer ofnuclear testing– setting out from Mumbai, in an ordinary three-tier sleeper, for Dehradun, 1,000 miles (1,600km) north. The frazzled train fell off any semblance of a schedule. The voyage grew longer, past 50 hours; hotter, past 50C. I remember the metallic burn on the window grilles; the hot, killing wind that blew through them; the sizzle of water drops splashed on the face when theyhit the uncovered platforms in the heart of the country; the melt of my rubber soles. A fortnight later, having trekked to the mouth of a tributary of the Ganges, completing my expedition from the Arabian Sea to a Himalayan glacier, it was possible to look back on the rail ordeal with affection.View image in fullscreenRahul Bhattacharya with his childrenI wonder, as I write, whether this memory seeped into the heat-addled odyssey made by the runaway protagonist of my novelRailsong. Physically depleted as she is by its end, she is sustained by the benevolence and solidarity of strangers. Alighting in the great city of Bombay, as Mumbai was then called, standing below the gargoyles of the gothic masterpiece then called the Victoria terminus (now the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj terminus), she knows she has emerged on the other side of something.In no other activity, so easily available to all, does India offer itself up as wholly as train travel. Mahatma Gandhi, initially a critic of the railway system (“Railways accentuate the evil nature of man”), came around to accepting this, hitting the rails to understand his country on his return from South Africa. This is why I recommend to the prospective traveller not necessarily the heritage or scenic routes – though by all means sample the quaint narrow- or metre-gauge hill railways, or the gorgeous run down the Konkan coast – but instead using the railways simply as a way of getting from one place to another.During a halt, it is possible to pop out on to the platform and buy top-notch, farm-fresh lychees, custard apples and mangoesIn the process, one learns much about oneself. Consider sleeper travel. Is there a situation more exposing than sharing a compartment with strangers? With luck, you might fall into invigorating company. A few months ago, I made an overnight trip up from Mumbai to Delhi with three large policemen, one nursing an injured toe, another dedicated to his newspaper, the third his phone, each initially taciturn. As the journey unspooled, so did their stories. They were going out to capture someone. If it was anything like their last outing to Delhi, when a slippery accused murderer had them chase him for more than 600 miles across three states, these officers would make it on to the news again. Another time, a painstaking manhunt had taken them to Mangaluru on the south-western coast, where they discovered instead the fellow’s namesake – himself wanted in a decades-old riots case. That led to a medal.View image in fullscreen‘Is there a situation more exposing than sharing a compartment with strangers?’ … A sleeper train at New Delhi station.Photograph: REY Pictures/AlamyFood is also a valuable companion on the rails. No matter that dining cars are gone, that regulations about open flames have restricted platform fare, or that the foil-boxed meals served on premium services trigger thousands of official complaints every year and much casual grousing – eating remains a crucial railway habit. Depending on the season, and your route, it is possible to pop out on to the platform during a halt and buy top-notch, farm-fresh lychees, custard apples, bananas and mangoes in places famed for them.We curve out east from Delhi, the dusty brownscapes gradually getting greener, up past the trim tea gardens in the eastern Himalayan foothillsOn the Mumbai-Pune route in the west, vendors at Karjat align themselves with the carriage doors, bearing metal trays of the town’s famedvadapav– a deep-fried, lightly spiced potato ball, placed inside a soft bun with a mix of dry and wet chutneys (for the cautious, the dry is safer). On the same route, as banker (helper) engines push the rake (coupled carriages) up the Western Ghats, the hill station of Lonavala offers up its famouschikki– an energy-boosting sweet made from nuts and jaggery (unrefined cane sugar) – and the more decadent chocolate walnut fudge. In the southern states of Telangana and Karnataka, you might help yourself, as I did a few years ago, to vividly peppy breakfasts ofograni– a mixture of soft puffed rice and an array of condiments and spices, similar yet so distinct from the crunchy, mustardy puffed-ricejhalmuriof Bengal in the east. And there is always the prospect of packing yourself a tuck and sharing food with any friends you make along the way.Despite the myriad challenges of Indian train travel, the journeys are pleasurable and affordable, not to mention sustainable. For these reasons, my family and I do as much of our travelling as possible by rail. Routinely, we curve out east from Delhi, across the great swathe of the Gangetic plains, the dusty brownscapes gradually getting greener, up past the trim tea gardens in the eastern Himalayan foothills, through the narrow corridor known as the “chicken’s neck” (officially, the Siliguri Corridor), into bamboo-shaded Assam, to my wife’s ancestral home. This run, 24 or 28 hours long, depending on the service, sometimes stretches past 35. Our two young girls don’t mind; it’s flights that make them feel claustrophobic.View image in fullscreenChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj terminus in Mumbai.Photograph: Nikada/Getty ImagesThe causes of these delays are often dramatic, and instructive about Indian life.One time, a station footbridge collapsed under the weight of Kumbh Mela pilgrims – typically, a last-minute change of platforms was involved, causing a stampede – in the town then known as Allahabad (since renamed Prayagraj by a regime intent on scrubbing Islamic fingerprints off Indian history). More than 40 people died, putting into perspective my trivial discomfort of waiting in the chilly hours for the train to pull into Mughalsarai (also renamed, after the right-wing ideologueDeen Dayal Upadhyaya). On another occasion, a derailment sent us on a circuitous gallivant through Bihar and Bengal. Then there was the time our rake first mowed down three cows and then, in the middle of the night, smashed into a stalled Jeep. The occupants got away. Unfortunately, this is not always the case.On the railways, the local and the national are linked together, making the wholeOn a monsoonal Assamese morning in 2012, the train I was on came to a standstill beside a paddy field. This was an inexpensive regional service, fitted with unreserved bench-seating – in Indian Railways parlance, a “passenger” train – and it was halting at the merest hint of a station. But even by the standards of passenger trains, this seemed like an eccentric location. Eventually, I climbed off to investigate. In front of the locomotive sat a mangled autorickshaw. The bodies of three men had been laid alongside the tracks.I don’t mean to deter you from passenger services. In fact, I highly recommend them. In a land as diverse as India, a passenger train is a full-blooded immersion in the local: the dress; the produce the farmers carry; the food vendors serve up; the unknown halts that mail and express trains roar past, which are the centres of their own little worlds. After all, on the railways, as in certain novels, the intimate and the epic, the local and the national, are linked together, making the whole.Rahul Bhattacharya’s latest novel, Railsong, is publishedbyBloomsbury(£18.99).

Some places make a feature of their situation, revealing sections of pots not dissimilar to the cross section of snapped wafer biscuits, while others have smoothed the curves with plaster.A few use the caves as originally intended – that is, as natural warehouses offering steady low temperatures and good humidity. In short: the ideal temperature for storing certain foods and wine. Most recently, Vincenzo Mancini, whose project DOL distributes artisanal products from small agricultural realities in Lazio, has taken over a deep cave behind door 93, reclaiming it as an urban ageing space for cheese and cured meat. I visited a few months ago with the chefs from Trullo in London, to do a cheese tasting – and to eat an unexpectedcacio e pepe.Cacio andformaggio: two words for cheese. The older of the two is cacio, from the Latin wordcaseus, which may well come fromcohaesus(cohesive), describing the transformation of milk into curds. Formaggio came later, from the medieval Latinformaticum (form), which in turn comes from the Greek φόρμος, the name given to the wicker container in which curdled milk was placed in order to drain and shape.Writing in about AD50, the agronomist Columella noted: “The best cheese is the one made with the least possible amount of medicine!” No change there, then. His treatise on agriculture, De Re Rustica, also includes detailed instructions of cheese making, and in particular how fresh sheep’s milk was heated with lamb or kid rennet until it coagulated into clotty curds and watery whey. The curds were drained in baskets, sprinkled with salt and then left in a cool, dark place. At the time, cheese was also the daily consequence of numerous flocks travelling with legions – which brings us to what the food writer Eleonora Baldwin describes asla barretta energetica(the energy bar), received daily by the marching men. That is, a stick of cheese.The name pecorino in relation to cheese came later, from the Latinpecus pecŏris(sheep). Like cacio, pecorino was (and is) a generic term applicable to infinite forms, which historically didn’t need any qualification or geographical identity because theywerethe local cheese (cacio). It is only when products moved beyond where they were made that they needed to be identified, protected, marketed, which is why we havepecorino sardo,pecorino romano, pecorino siciliano, pecorino toscano, pecorino filano, pecorino crotonese… And these are just the ones with official status – there are hundreds more.While pecorino romano is far from the only pecorino in the story of the food of Rome and Lazio, it has since ancient times beenthe cacio. (Also important to note is that following laws created in the late 1800s and the effects of urban growth in the 1950s, more than 95% of pecorino romano has been produced on the cheesemaking island of Sardinia, the rest in Lazio and the Tuscan province of Grosseto.) Focusing on Lazio, Vincenzo works with Deroma dairy in Torrita Tiberina, taking wheels of 12-month pecorino romano, their rinds still the colour of pale straw, and ageing them. It is not just the microclimate of the cave; the bacterial microflora within the walls plays a part in the development of flavour, seeing the creamy, sheepish and sharp (salty) flavour deepening, both mellowing and becoming more opinionated at 24, 36, 48 months and beyond. The rounds themselves also develop carefully controlled mould coats, ranging from mottled clam brown to dark moss green.The next cave along is occupied by a restaurant called Flavio al Velavevodetto, so when the conversation turned to how best to transform pecorino romano (cacio) and black pepper (pepe) into the creamy sauce so fashionable today, Vincenzo went from one cave to another. He returned with a cloth full of just-cookedtonnarelli, into which he tossed many handfuls of grated 36-month pecorino and black pepper, gathered it up, shook, rubbed and served. The performance was interesting because this is likely how shepherds, with their cheese-making apparatus and daily supplies, once made the dish – also how clever innkeepers once got clients to drink more. It was even more interesting because the soft, sandy molecules of cheese clings to the fresh pasta like sand. And it is worth trying: estimate 150g of fresh pasta, 50g of grated pecorino and a heaped teaspoon of freshly smashed pepper per person. Personally I have never enjoyed cacio e pepe more.Cacio e pepe in a cloth (in un panno)Serves2Salt100g pecorino2 heaped tspwhole black peppercorns1 very large napkin or cotton tea-towel300g fresh tonnarelli, or tagliatelleBring a pan of well-salted water to the boil. Grate the cheese on the star side of the grater so it’s soft and sandy – avoid a microplane if possible. Smash the peppercorns with something heavy until coarsely crushed.Prepare the cloth: it must be big enough that you can gather up the ends and form a bag to shake.Cook the pasta according to packet instructions until al dente. Use a spider slice or tongs to lift the pasta on to the cloth, spreading it out a bit so it dries a little. Sprinkle the cheese and pepper over the top, then gather up the ends of the cloth so they form a bag. Shake and rub the fabric so the cheese distributes in an even, sandy way.Open up the cloth and, if are in a field, eat directly from the cloth, otherwise lift it on to plates. Serve with plenty of wine or water.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkCheesePastaVegetarian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

On a road trip tracing Poland’s best terroirs back in the summer of 2023, I met winemakers going against the grain, unshackled by tradition and producing unpretentious, expressive pours that more than merit a place on your dining table.Lately, Polish wines have been cropping up all over bar and restaurant lists: Niemczańska’s chardonnay at London’s most emblematic Polish restaurant, the borscht-frontedDaquisein South Kensington, say, while chic barSpryin Edinburgh has started stocking my favourite producers, Dom Bliskowice, Kamil Barczentewicz and Nizio.But you won’t find bottles nestling between the neat rows ofkabanossausages of your localPolski sklep, nor lining the supermarket shelves. Or not just yet, anyway.Among my parents’ generation, the term “Polish wine” is marred by sickly-sweet memories of moonshined fruit concoctions, but the country’s grape-growing heyday was some 500 years ago, courtesy of Cistercian monks. An unfortunate succession of icy temperatures, wars a-plenty and communism dealt its vines a hammer blow, but, in typical Polish fashion, something beautiful blossomed out of all that hardship. A loosening of laws in 2008 catalysed the country’s contemporary wine revival. I spent a stint living in Warsaw a decade ago, when the city bristled with cool, creative cuisine, but back then it wasn’t easy to find homegrown wine on a menu. But no longer: more than 600winnice(wineries) have sprung up across all 16voivode(regions), with the heaviest smattering along Poland’s southeast and southwest fringes.Today, plantings include hardy hybrids such as solaris and hibernal, which can weather the harsh winters, and, increasingly, in our warming climate, classicvitis viniferavarieties such as riesling and pinot noir, though tiny outputs make it tricky (and pricey) to get hold of over here.I loved Ultra, an earthy, herbaceous skin-contact johanniter made by Maciej Sondij of Dom Bliskowice, an architect turned Burgundy importer and restaurateur, on the ammonite-studded inclines two-and-a-half hours’ drive south of Warsaw. At Winnica Silesian, a former communist collective on granite-laden soil 30 miles outside Wrocław, Esben Madsen (a Danish oceanographer who married into the founding Mazurek family) produces playful pours, including a beaujolais-like red made from rondo, dubbedRondo Vous.Much arrives through the UK’s sole Polish wine importer, Adam Michocki, a Leeds-based sommelier who set upCentral Winesafter being wowed by an “absolutely spectacular” bottle from Silesia in 2021. He works with small, family-run wineries, supplying a host of Michelin-starred restaurants and chefs (think Sat Bains, Gordon Ramsay, Heston Blumenthal) as well as independent wine shops across the country, to sell-out reception. “The fresh, crisp nature of Polish wines really fits the current trend for the palate of UK customers,” he says. Cheers –na zdrowie– to that.Four Polish bottles that are worth a tasteNiemczańska 2020 Chardonnay£24.90 Central Wines, 12.8%. Like a polished white burgundy via Lower Silesia. Clean vanilla notes, hot buttered toast and a medium body that’s a dream with mushroom-sauerkraut stuffed pierogi.Silesian Cuvee Coloree NV£31.50 Highbury Vintners, 12%On the list at The Spärrows in Manchester, this hotchpotch of three different vintages and varieties (rondo, regent and cabernet cortis) results in a crushable red with silky tannins and sour cherries on the palate.Kamil Barczentewicz 2023 Riesling£19.50 The Wine Society, 12%Green mango, white peach – a cool-climate riesling reminiscent of something you’d find in Alsace, from a star producer near the Renaissance town of Kazimierz Dolny, southeast Poland.Turnau Solaris 2024£29.80 Central Wines, 12.5% Swap your sauvignon blanc for this bright, joyful solaris made in Baltic-tempered northwest Poland: an explosion of citrus, tropical fruit and rosy apples.Victoria Brzezinski is co-author of Drinking the World: A Wine Odyssey, published by Pavilion Books/HarperCollins at £22.
