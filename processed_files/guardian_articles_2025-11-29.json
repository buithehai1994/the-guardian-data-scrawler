The chancellor’s mansion tax is a small but brave step forwardPhillip InmanThe high-value council tax surcharge may only raise £400m but it’s the best opportunity for a bigger, fairer tax on wealthSat 29 Nov 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 29 Nov 2025 11.01 ESTShareRachel Reeves won little creditlast weekfor lifting the lid on one of the most heated tax debates of the past three decades.Who in their right mind would consider engaging in the fight that would inevitably lead to some of the richest people in the land calling for your head?Gordon Brown ran scared and so, too, did countless Tory chancellors.‘I don’t live in a mansion. It’s a 1930s house’: Richmond residents react to council tax riseRead moreYet Reeves has put her hand in the fire, saying in the budget that she would revalue about 2.4m of the most valuable homes in England with a view to slapping a“mansion tax”– an escalating surcharge – on about 100,000 of them from April 2028.As a revamp of council tax, it constitutes baby steps, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said in the hours after Reeves gave her second budget.But what the IFS and many others failed to credit was the revolutionary element that could be found in the revaluation itself.Property owners fear a value being put on their home by the state like they fear almost nothing else. There hasn’t been a spot-check on English property valuations since legislation in 1991 unleashed the council tax banding system on a nation shellshocked by the poll tax riots and the hasty departure of its most prominent cheerleader, Margaret Thatcher.View image in fullscreenHomes valued in the highest band (worth more than £5m) will pay an extra £7,500 a year in tax.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PAThe A-to-H banding system has always been regressive – taxing lower-value homes much more harshly than those that have, in many cases, soared in value since the mid-1990s.Under the chancellor’s new plan, from April 2028 there will be four price bands, adding a surcharge of £2,500 a year for properties valued in 2026 at between £2m and £2.5m, up to £7,500 a year for those valued in the highest band of £5m and above. The surcharge will apply on top of council tax and go straight to the Treasury.To give a sense of how much this measure constitutes a baby step, it will raise just £400m. Compare that modest sum with John Muellbauer’s proposal to revalue the top two bands – G and H – to raise about £6bn. A £6m home paying a tax based on 0.5% of the value would pay £30,000 a year under the Oxford professor’s scheme.Property owners don’t just shake at the prospect of being taxed at a higher rate. There is the prospect of a fall in values once homes are taxed more heavily.In London, there are more than 68,000 properties in band H, which now includes homes worth £320,000 and above in 1991, when the properties were valued. The gains made over the last three decades are historically unprecedented. Homes worth £320,000 back then are easily worth five or six times that now.A surcharge on existing council tax bills might make higher-value homes less attractive and values could fall. Estate agents report that homes at the top of the market have already slumped in value after thenon-dom tax rise.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Suffice to say, the plan was ditched along with many of the party’s principles as the price of coalition with David Cameron’s Conservatives.View image in fullscreenEd Miliband floated a crude, and ill-fated, mansion tax scheme in 2013.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockEd Miliband backed a £30,000-a-year “mansion tax” on £2m properties in 2013. It was a crude scheme and considered a ruse to split the Lib Dems from their Tory partners. Sir Vince Cable denounced it in the Commons and the plan foundered.Miliband revived it before the 2015 election and the Lib Dems came up with a system of more bands, but both parties lost badly in that election and the mansion tax idea – widely considered to be electoral suicide – was not heard of again.Council tax reform or any attempt at a surcharge was not mentioned in the Labour party’s 2024 election manifesto.Reeves, though, has offered a much more sophisticated framework than any previously, one that is not only fairer at the outset, but can be adapted in the future once the revaluations are in place.It is, without doubt, the best opportunity for a bigger, fairer tax on wealth and one that is possible within a couple of years. There will never be a tax in Britain that is called a wealth tax. Everything in the world of tax needs to be done by stealth when ministers are endlessly fearful of a loud public backlash. It is why Reeves should get a bravery award if she can make it happen.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025Viewpoint columnBudgetEconomicsEconomic growth (GDP)Economic policyRachel ReevesCouncil taxcommentShareReuse this content"

Over 600 pages this “memoir of sorts” ranges from her childhood growing up in the Canadian backwoods to her grief at the death of her partner of 48 years, the writer Graeme Gibson, in 2019, with many friendships, the occasional spat and more than 50 books (including Cat’s Eye, Alias Grace and the Booker prizewinning The Blind Assassin and The Testaments) in between.The author, who turned 86 last week, always likes to take the long view, often from a couple of centuries’ distance. As Rebecca Solnit notes below, she now has a long view of our times. Age and the freedom of being a writer (as she says, she can’t get sacked) make her fearless in speaking out.She always dismisses the notion of prophetic powers –“I’d have cornered the stock market,” she has said(although she did predict the financial crash in her 2008 bookPayback). She certainly doesn’t want to be idolised as a saint – that rarely ends well, and besides, she holds grudges. She even chafes against her mantle as feminist icon, “expected to do the Right Thing for women in all circumstances, with many different Right Things projected on to me from readers and viewers”, as she writes in Book of Lives.Atwood is as hard to pin down as the insects she and her brother, Harold, played with as children, encouraged by her father’s job as an entomologist. A natural scientist (many of her family were scientifically inclined) and sceptic, she is also a dabbler in palm-reading and the occult. There is nothing she can’t tell you about nature, from the sex lives of snails to rare birds (see questions from Jonathan Franzen and Anne Enright); or history – the Salem witch trials and the French Revolution are particular areas of expertise.She can be silly and stern, sometimes within the same sentence, but there is a deep moral seriousness beneath all her work. She supports many good causes, young writers and environmental projects. She still goes to the Arctic Circle each year, and to Pelee Island for the bird migration each spring. Somehow, she has found time to write some of the finest books of the past 50 years: poetry, dystopia, historical novels, speculative fiction, a graphic novel, countless essays and now, finally, a memoir.The author would strongly disapprove of this inventory of her achievements – she is Canadian, after all. But it is by way of saying, it is no wonder that some of our other great thinkers and writers have burning questions – how to cure a hangover? Or topple the patriarchy – to put to her.One final piece of advice from the last epigraph to Book of Lives: “Don’t piss her off, or you will live for ever.”George SaundersView image in fullscreenCongratulations onBook of Lives. Perhaps you remember that long-ago day when you saved me from dying by hangover in a car on the way to Salisbury, by way of some sort of homeopathic remedies? I’veheard you talk masterfully about contemporary biology and philosophy and many other topics, and so admire the way this wisdom permeates your fiction. So, my serious question is: what does your other-than-fiction reading life look like?How have you managed to come to know so much? Also (a follow-up): which pills were those that day?Last Q first: I remember that day well – our drive from Hay-on-Wye – and the very funny but wistful piece you wrote about it for the New Yorker. I’m so sorry you got ambushed by British beer. You were an alarming shade of green. What I did: 1. We put you in the front seat. 2. And advised you to look at the horizon. 3. And stay hydrated.I fed you some pills from the little pharmacy I carry around. Mums do that, and the habit has stuck. I think they included ginger Gravol, used for seasickness; some form of antacid, such as Tums; some kind of hard candy to provide a bit of electrolyte; anything else I thought might help. Not painkillers though; I thought they might make you sicker.How do I know so much? It accumulates as time passes, like fluff under the sofaMy other-than-fiction reading list looks like piles on the floor and various sections of shelving, loosely organised: quite a lot of folklore, mythology, folk ballads, witches, etc, from many countries – a childhood interest that has persisted – I just addedGreenland. A big stash of human rights/second-wave feminism, with some updating; an even bigger section on war, the largest two parts being the second world war (I inherited the collection of my father-in-law the Canadian general, see the storyA Dusty Lunch) and the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars, a current obsession, as I feel we live in a revolutionary era – and no, revolutions are not always of the “left”. Nature stuff – father and brother both biologists, Graeme a bird zealot, which makes me a pedantic and probably annoying person to go for outdoor walks with. (But Merlin and iNaturalist apps have created whole generations of citizen scientists.) Big collections of Canadian writing – fiction, history, poetry – mostly from the 60s, 70s, 80s, then it got too big. Novels from other countries. History of clothing. And on …How do I know so much? It accumulates as time passes, like fluff under the sofa. I’ve always been curious.George MonbiotView image in fullscreenGiven that the great majority of us are not psychopaths, why do we keep electing them to high office, and how do we break the habit?Quite often, in elections, people are not given the choice of something they actually want. So they vote, not for the best, but for the one they think will be the least worst. Not surprisingly, they sometimes get it wrong. And in an age of disinformation (see 18th-century political pamphleteering, just for a fun comparison) the possibility of deciding on the basis of accurate information may be pretty low.Jonathan FranzenView image in fullscreenYou’ve been a strong proponent of new technologies for writers, most notably social media. Has the increasingly malignant power ofbigtech given you any second thoughts?You betcha. Utopian projects – early internet, oh goodie, we can now all share our beautiful and helpful thoughts – frequently go bad, because, surprise, our shared thoughts are not always beautiful and helpful. If we could turn back time … how about to the preagricultural age? Not without its problems either, I’m afraid.Whatbirdhaven’t you seen and would still dearly love to see?The dodo (joke). The great auk (also joke). I’ve never seen an ostrich in the wild, though I have seen a cassowary. How about a European bee-eater? Gorgeous, they say.Right now I have a feeling of: “This is where I came in.” The polarisation of the 1930s, then the second world war. I was born in 1939, so there have been a lot of changes since then!Rebecca SolnitView image in fullscreenOne of the pleasures/horrors of a long life is being a witness to change. What are the greatest changes you’ve witnessed, the ones that most preoccupy you, or the ones you think we should pay most attention to?Right now I have a feeling of: “This is where I came in.” The polarisation of the 1930s, then the second world war. I was born in 1939, so there have been a lot of changes since then! To name a few:1. In 1939 there was hardly any plastic. The first big wave of it broke in the early 50s. Everyone thought it was great.2. The switch from coal to oil in the 50s.3. The advent of television, also in the 50s. Before that it was radio, with families gathered around the set, ears flapping.4. The advent of antibiotics – magic! – and more vaccines, including polio. My generation of children had a lot of “childhood diseases”, including diphtheria, which killed young children. Four of my cousins died of it.5. My generation was all about work ethic. You were just expected to work hard. We thought the 60s hippies were, well, lazy.6. Civil rights in the 60s, however. We approved of that.7. The advent of the pill for public consumption, in the 60s, around the same time as pantyhose, followed by the miniskirt and shortly after that by second-wave feminism. A huge change, hardly possible before the pill.8. With Reagan (1980), the beginning of the end of theNew Dealand the rise of the “religious right” as a political force, thus The Handmaid’s Tale, which many then thought would be impossible in the liberal, free‑world leader, the United States.9. The collapse of the USSR and its bloc, 1989-90. Far‑reaching consequences not apparent at the time. Move one chess piece and all are affected.10. Did I say media changes – in music, from vinyl LPs to tape cassettes and then CDs, and then the advent of the internet and smartphones and social media?And now the rise of authoritarians and totalitarians … as I say, this is where I came in. Pay attention to the patterns of power grabs, infighting, the disintegration of the rule of law. See Macbeth. And I, Claudius. And the wealth and power imbalances just before the French Revolution. And yes, read Nineteen Eighty-Four.

Japanese female prime minister?) and what you mean by patriarchy (men rule everything? Men are taller, on average?). For me, the Q of the day is rather: can we even hold the line – the line on one side of which women don’t have jobs, money or political rights; and on the other side of which they do?There is no ‘inevitable course of history’. And yes, individuals have made a difference. And can still do.

Or are they just verbiage that gets trotted out on solemn occasions?As for hypocrisy, it has been a constant factor in human societies. But there are high points and low ones. Now that we are seeing the greatest democracy of modern times turning away from these ideals, the ideals are looking better as aspirations than they have for a while.

Introduction by Dina NayeriSat 29 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 29 Nov 2025 07.02 ESTShareIn 2009, Swiss photographers Mathias Braschler and Monika Fischer set out to document the people suffering the first shocks of the climate crisis. They had just returned from China, where rapid, unregulated development has ravaged the natural landscapes. Back home, though, the debate still felt strangely theoretical. “In 2009, you still had people who denied climate change,” Braschler recalls. “People said, ‘This is media hype.’” So the couple, working with the Global Humanitarian Forum in Geneva and supported by Kofi Annan, began The Human Face of Climate Change, a portrait series that showed the people on the frontline of a warming world.Sixteen years later, climate change is no longer up for debate; the urgent discussions now revolve around solutions. Braschler and Fischer, too, have shifted their focus. “This is going to be one of the central issues for humanity,” says Braschler, “and we want to make sure that people know that the major effect of climate change will be displacement.”So they returned to the road, this time to capture the bewildering moment when deep-rooted communities, some with generations of inherited knowledge, find themselves estranged from their land. The result is Displaced (2025),a sweeping, multi-year project created across 12 countries, gathering together more than 60 portraits of people forced from their homes by drought, floods, desertification, sea-level rise, wildfires, and the slow collapse of local ecosystems. It is among the first photographic efforts to approach climate displacement on such a global scale, documenting the human impact of headline-making catastrophes such as California’s wildfires alongside quieter ones. The latter might begin when a farmer notices marshland waters becoming salty, or when a fishmonger watches the coastline erode and wonders if the next wave will come tonight.View image in fullscreenRaquel Fontoura with her children Kelvin, Lourdes Angelina and Kaua. They lost their home in the devastating floods that hit the region of Porto Alegre in Brazil at the end of April 2024.It’s devastating to lose your home in a day, and terrifying to watch it happen slowly, year after year, until one morning there’s no option but to leave. After a few hours with this collection, I feel awake to both the particularities of each loss and their collective reach. These are the brave first responders to a global catastrophe already under way; one that, sooner or later, will reach all our doors. I’m struck, too, by the rawness and dignity of the portraits. “We take time,” Fischer says. “We sit and talk with people. It’s not about getting a quick photo.” Their method is slow and meticulous: a portable studio, a backdrop, careful lighting. “People open up more when they feel you’re truly interested. They react very positively to that level of care. And theyseethe photos. In Kenya, the Turkana people loved seeing themselves like that. They looked proud, dignified.” Women, especially, responded strongly to Fischer, an artist doing her work with her son in tow. “To show up as a family was a huge advantage,” she says. “Displacement seems to be very much a woman’s story. Losing your home, making those decisions. It’s very much in women’s hands.”The portraits are paired with images of homes, marshes, hillsides and coastlines now lost, damaged, or receding. In Mongolia, former herders stand before the camera after losing hundreds of animals to a historicdzud, the extreme winter that has become more frequent as the country warms at twice the global average. “We battled with snow from morning until night,” says Nerguibaatar Batmandakh, a herder now working as a security guard. “Every morning, there would be a dozen animals dead, another dozen in the evening.” In Brazil, families displaced by the 2024 floods speak to the photographers in a humanitarian reception centre in Porto Alegre. Standing beside her three teenagers, still in shock, Raquel Fontoura talks about losing her sense of purpose. “I also lost a piece of myself.” Pedro Luiz de Souza, a single father in the same camp, worries about how to tell his daughter their home is gone. “She still thinks she can go back and pick up that doll, or pick up that drawing that she liked.”View image in fullscreenFrom left: Raad Aoufi, Karrar Aoufi and Rasul Aoufi are former farmers who are now construction workers from Basra, Iraq.The pattern repeats across continents. In Louisiana, high-school student Alaysha LaSalle recalls looking out of the window as a 2020 hurricane tore her town apart: “All we’ve seen were our poles that our house was standing up on, and that was all that was left. No house.”These disasters are immediately shocking, Fischer says, but equally upsetting is the slow onset of catastrophe: “when people lose their lifestyle – hundreds of years of tradition is lost now in our generation”. In Iraq’s marshlands, considered to be the cradle of our civilisation, the great wetlands of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers are drying. Rasul Aoufi, a construction worker, mourns his farming life. “We had animals and we could care for them – there was water and there was food to feed them. But now, there’s no water left, no birds, nothing.” Abbas Gurain Hubaish Alammary, a water-buffalo farmer, holds his four-year-old daughter, Fatima, in his arms. “In the past, there was fishing, there was life in the marshes. But all of that is gone.”Drone footage of damage caused by extreme weather in Switzerland, Mongolia, Germany, USA, and SenegalDrone footage of the damage caused by extreme weather in Switzerland, Mongolia, Germany, the USA and SenegalIt’s undeniable that it is easier to withstand disaster in a wealthy country – and yet those disasters get the bulk of our attention. When we talk about climate displacement in developing countries, it is often in fearful tones about mass migration to the west, even though most displacement happens within national borders and takes people only as far as they need to survive. “We hear so much about illegal migration,” Braschler says. “But we’re still talking about humans. Desperate people who have no other choice.”“Our greatest wish as fishers,” says Khadim Wade from Senegal, “is to wake up by the sea.”Dina Nayeri is the author of Who Gets Believed? and The Ungrateful RefugeeSenegalView image in fullscreenEach year, the ocean inches up the shore of Saint-Louis, the country’s former capital, and more of it disappears beneath the waves, forcing families to relocate.Doudou Sy (pictured main image) and Khadim Wade, fishers.

Rage rooms are cropping up across the UK, allowing punters to smash seven bells out of old TVs, plates and furniture.Such pay-to-destroy ventures are thought to have originated in Japan in 2008,but have since gone global. In the UK alone venues can be found in locations from Birmingham to Brighton, with many promoting destruction as a stress-relieving experience.According toSmash It Rage Roomsin south-east London, where a 30-minute solo session costs £50, “each smash is a cathartic release, a burst of pure, primal joy”.“We are at capacity – we were looking for another venue because we can’t keep up with demand,” said Amelia Smewing, who set up the business with her husband after exploring ways to help their son cope with PTSD.Nicola Davis’s rage room experienceNicola Davis’s rage room experienceRob Clark, an operations director atUrban Xtreme Ltd, said the popularity of its Rage Room was growing year on year, with customers ranging from younger people looking for a unique experience, to groups of women celebrating break-ups, and people using the space as a “healthy outlet” for stress or mental health challenges.Clark said many customers were navigating tough personal challenges. “The feedback we get is consistently good – the Rage Room gives them a safe, constructive way to release pent-up anger and frustration, and it’s making a genuine difference to their mental wellbeing,” he said, adding several youth care homes regularly bring their teenagers, while a handful of therapists actively refer clients when traditional talking therapy is not enough.Rage rooms and primal screams: how stressed-out workers are letting off steamRead moreLucy Bee, the founder ofRage Rooms Leamington Spasaid her venue also hosted visits from schools and children’s homes. But people also just come for fun. “It’s so against how we’re conditioned to behave,” she said. “It is so naughty.”Like other venues, Bee said, the typical “rager” is female. “We’re talking early 40s, woman, a couple of kids, good job,” she said.Bee added that having trained as a holistic therapist she found many women experience guilt and shame over feeling angry.“A lot of women … are at breaking point, permanently teetering, living in survival mode. And this gives them a way to just let it out,” Bee said,adding that for some people who were struggling the experience could act as a gateway towards seeking further help.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So I don a protective outfit, pull down my visor and enter one of Bee’s rage rooms.Within seconds I am turning wine bottles into explosions of glass, laughing in surprise at myself. But I don’t enjoy the noise and am thinking more about the mess than experiencing a release.Experts, too, have qualms.Last year Dr Sophie Kjærvik, now at the Norwegian Center for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies in Oslo,co-authored a reviewinto what activities fuel or douse rage. She said the evidence suggested “venting” was actually counterproductive.“You’re activating your body in a way that your brain can interpret as that you’re getting more angry,” she said. “We found that doing meditation and mindfulness and muscle relaxation activities are way more productive ways of dealing with anger.” Kjærvik said cognitive behavioural therapy was also very efficient.Dr Ryan Martin, a dean at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay and an author of several books on anger, said people who relied on catharsis stayed angrier for longer, and were more likely to lash out aggressively after the fact. “I think the problem is it feels good, so people assume it’s good for them,” he said. “But at the same time, other things that we know might feel good when we’re emotional, like drinking, overeating, … aren’t necessarily good for us either.”Prof Brad Bushman of Ohio State University, who co-authored the review with Kjærvik, also raised concerns. “When people feed their anger in these rage rooms, they’re just practising how to behave more aggressively,” he said.Smewing emphasised that rage rooms were a conditioned environment. “Just because they’ve smashed up the air fryer at the rage room doesn’t mean they’re going to go home and smash up the air fryer in their kitchen,” she said.Suzy Reading, a chartered member of the British Psychological Society and author of the book How to be Selfish, said it was not that anger should not be expressed, but that there were many ways to do this, including writing and breathing exercises. Reading also said while rage rooms may offer an outlet for stress they cost money and did not provide insights into the causes of such feelings.“If there isn’t an understanding of what caused it, then we just go back into our home lives and our work lives and our communities, and nothing changes,” she said. “And for a lot of women, [the cause is] going to be unmet needs.”Reading said it could be important to move through some of the feelings of anger in order to have effective conversations. “We want to regulate our nervous system so that we can articulate well,” she said.Explore more on these topicsMental healthAnxietyPsychologyWomenHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The Rothermere family, however, takes a more relaxed approach to time.While most business boards draw up five-year plans, the Rothermeres, having compiled a feared media empire over more than a century, are used to thinking in terms of generations.It was in the summer of 2004 that Jonathan Harold Esmond Vere Harmsworth, 4thViscount Rothermere, the tall, curly haired and immaculately turned out proprietor of the Daily Mail, failed in his bid to acquire the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph.By Rothermere’s assessment, the failure delighted Rupert Murdoch because it would have created a stable of rightwing newspapers powerful enough to rival the “unique political leverage” of Murdoch’s own titles, then comprising the Times, Sunday Times, the Sun and News of the World.The softly spoken Rothermere, however, was able to play a longer game. The Telegraph titles were again put up for sale in 2023. Since then,two prospective owners have come and gone, both after internal Telegraph revolts over their suitability. Rothermere has now swooped.In the process, the 57-year-old has reaffirmed his family’s obsession with British newspapers, after his forebears bought, sold and smashed together some of the biggest titles of their day.“Lord Rothermere has got a business head, but he’s not sharply business minded,” said Alex DeGroote, a media analyst who has previously worked closely withDaily Mailand General Trust (DMGT). “This sounds a bit cheesy, but he’s genuinely passionate about journalism. I suspect internally, they’ve wanted to unite media businesses that serve centre-right audiences for decades.”View image in fullscreenLord and Lady Rothermere, for whom media acquisitions are a family affair.Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/PAHuge issues remain before the hereditary peer’s DMGT group can clinch the titles. Alongside the competition and media plurality concerns, Telegraph insiders are asking how he will stump up the £500m valuation. However, Rothermere’s hopes of creating a conservative media powerhouse have been rekindled.It was a bold bid for a proprietor who prides himself on staying behind the scenes, often noting his willingness to let the pugnacious and often brutal views of the Daily Mail contradict his own gentler, more pro-European conservatism.With the Rothermeres, however, media acquisitions are a family affair. A portrait of Alfred Harmsworth, his great-great-uncle who founded the Daily Mail in 1896, dominates Rothermere’s office. One of his earliest memories was of his father, Vere, taking him to the hot-metal newspaper presses.A young Jonathan would be included in conversations about the difficult start for the Mail on Sunday in 1982. He remembers the stress of the vicious battle in 1987 between the London Daily News and his family’sEvening Standard, which he later sold.Rothermere himself flirted with journalism, working as a subeditor and reporter on the Sunday Mail in Scotland, before concentrating on the business side of his family’s group. When his father died of a heart attack in 1998, Rothermere is said to have had about 20 minutes upon returning home from the hospital before company calls began, in effect starting his chairing of DMGT, aged 30.He has previously sold off profitable parts of the business to refocus on the Mail and other newspaper assets. The Telegraph bid is the latest sign of his keenness to reaffirm the family’s media stronghold. “This is a 20-year plus target acquisition,” said a former DMGT executive. “He doesn’t want the Mail as the only newspaper asset he leaves for his son Vere.”View image in fullscreenLord Rothermere looks on as the then Tory leader, David Cameron, looks at a copy of the Evening Standard while visiting a printing plant in Didcot, Oxfordshire, in 2008.Photograph: Jamie Wiseman/Daily Mail/Rex/ShutterstockRothermere’s decision to take DMGT private in 2021 has also made the Telegraph pursuit easier. “I don’t have to justify myself to anybody,” he said shortly after the decision.The long pursuit of the Telegraph does not change the fact that the Mail will always be his first love. Favoured figures from the title are invited to his country estate. “He’s a Mail man, through and through,” said an acquaintance.So what does this Mail man want with the Telegraph, whose rightwing politics have, to some critics,increasingly become even more astringent than those of the Mail? Radical surgery is not on the cards in the short term. “I would not have turned it tabloid,” Rothermere said, in a rare public reflection on his failed 2004 purchase. “The Telegraph is not the Daily Mail.”He is targeting growth for both titles in the US, where the Wall Street Journal is relatively unopposed as a national title on the centre right. He also believes the Mail, still primarily driven by advertising and the newsstand, can learn from the Telegraph’s more subscription-based model.In fact, the family’s involvement in the Telegraph has already begun; Rothermere’s daughter is a business reporter at the title.It also hosts an extended Daily Mail family. Chris Evans, the Telegraph’s editor, is a former Mail executive. He is one of a series of editors across the British media who learned at the knee ofPaul Dacre, the uncompromising former Mail editor who worked with Rothermere and his father.View image in fullscreenWith British politics seemingly sliding to the right, there are inevitable political concerns about uniting the Mail and Telegraph.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockIntervening to change the Telegraph’s politics would be out of character. Dacre, still editor-in-chief at DMG Media, told the Guardian that neither Rothermere nor his father interfered editorially.“That is the main reason why I turned down very enticing offers to edit the Times and the Telegraph,” he said. “Frankly, I simply didn’t believe that Rupert Murdoch or [the former Telegraph proprietor] Conrad Black would give me that freedom. It’s difficult to overstate how valuable that freedom is to an editor.“Fleet Street is littered with the corpses of sacked editors who, amid crashing circulations, tried to please their proprietors rather than their readers. The Rothermeres have always understood that. It’s a sacred principle for them that editors are given total editorial autonomy, with the brutally clear understanding that they are dismissed if they produce poor papers.”Dacre said the hands-off approach came at a cost for Rothermere. “It’s no secret that his own political views were, and are, sometimes at odds with the Mail’s,” he said. “Columnists, news stories, diary items and the paper’s sometimes controversial editorial position would not infrequently cause him embarrassment with his friends and social circle. He never once complained and I cannot tell you how much I admired such fortitude.“Despite this, he has always enjoyed the company of journalists and counts some as friends. And, yes, he has this extraordinary passion for newspapers which I believe you need if you want to own them because they are irrational beasts that defy normal business logic.“After the launches of the Mail on Sunday,Metroand MailOnline, the Rothermeres lost countless millions over many years before turning a shilling. And of course, the company lost eye-watering sums on the Standard before reluctantly selling it.”View image in fullscreenRothermere and Paul Dacre (right) in 2007. The former Mail editor said: ‘It’s a sacred principle for them [the Rothermeres] that editors are given total editorial autonomy.’Photograph: Alan Davidson/Silverhub/Rex/ShutterstockAnother former national newspaper editor was more cynical: “It’s easy not to interfere with the editor if you largely agree with what they put out,” they said.Rothermere’s light touch approach is perhaps again informed by family history. They have been dogged by criticism over his great-grandfather’s support for fascism and Oswald Mosley’s Blackshirts movement in the pages of the Daily Mail in the 1930s.As for who would edit the Telegraph under his ownership, Rothermere has explicitly praised Evansin a statement on the Telegraph takeover. While that may signal Evans is a sure thing to stay in post, it is also an understandable gesture, given that the guns of the Telegraph’s newsroom have beenturned on previous suitors.With British politics seemingly sliding to the right, there are inevitable political concerns about uniting the Mail and Telegraph at a time when both have been boosting coverage of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party.Many liberal politicians believe the Mail’s abrasive style has become even starker in recent times, pointing to its championing of talking pointspushed by Farage on immigration and the “woke” agenda. Some believe the Telegraph has undergone an even more radical shift, often running radical-right opinion pieces that go beyond those of the Mail.Tim Walker, a former Telegraph diarist, contrasted its current guise with the staid, establishment-friendly paper overseen by the editor Bill Deedes in the 1970s and 80s. “The Telegraph is now less interested in news and more interested in comment,” he said. “It’s become a very shouty paper. Perhaps Dacre, as a news man, might change that.”View image in fullscreenBill Deedes in his office at the Daily Telegraph in 2015. As editor his paper was more staid and establishment-friendly than it is in its current guise.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The ObserverSenior Labour figures are concerned, along with the Liberal Democrats. “Concentrating so much agenda-setting power in the hands of so few would set a deeply concerning precedent,” said Anna Sabine, the Lib Dem culture spokesperson. The former Conservative cabinet minister David Davisis also opposed.Dacre argued that Rothermere’s papers were already more diverse than most realise. “Remember, the Standard’s readers were upmarket, liberal and metropolitan and espoused views that were diametrically opposed to the Daily Mail’s,” he said.“For their part, the Mail and Mail on Sunday backed different sides in the Brexit referendum. The Metro was deliberately designed to be apolitical in order to appeal to the young and the i Paper, whose editorial budget was increased by Jonathan after he bought it, couldn’t be more different from the Mail.“Today, the British media landscape is unrecognisable from a decade ago. British journalism is in a sad and parlous state. The regional and local press is dying. Several Fleet Street papers are a shadow of what they were. And it’s my hope, indeed my prayer, that the regulators now understand and recognise this.”There are numerous questions about how someone even with Rothermere’s resources has the cash. Most media analysts believe that a more representative price tag for the titles is in the region of £350m, but Rothermere is willing to pay a premium.DMGT does not have a ready £500m, the price apparently insisted upon by RedBird IMI as it seeks to recoup the loan thatgained it control of the titlestwo years ago.View image in fullscreenA video screengrab showing Lord Rothermere along with Donald Trump in Doha in May.Photograph: Sky NewsRothermere’s previous potential bid for the Telegraph in 2023 involved backers from Qatar. He has developed links in the Middle East, where his events business is performing strongly. In May, he was spotted among delegates with Donald Trump on a visit to Doha.However, his company has said there will be “no foreign state investment or capital” in the deal, to head off any potential investigation ordered by the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, under the new laws limiting foreign state ownership. It is understood the plan is to own the Telegraph outright, rather than lead a consortium.Telegraph staff have numerous other questions. Will RedBird, the fund involved in previous bids,have a role? Will loans lined up for those bids be deployed? Is Rothermere actually paying £500m?Waiting 20 years has helped Rothermere in some respects. The digital revolution means his team will tell regulators the new group will not be competing with other newspapers, but with the likes of Meta and Google. Meanwhile, the Labour government is pressuring regulators to actin a more “pro-growth” manner.“Go back five or 10 years and a Mail/Telegraph deal would have been unlikely to go through, and you wouldn’t have seen Comcast [the owner of Sky]look to try and buy ITV’s broadcasting business,” said Becket McGrath, a partner at the law firm Euclid Law. “But deals that historically would not have got through are being done. The [Competition and Markets Authority] is still having a close look, but it is being more flexible with remedies and solutions.”Some speculate Rothermere may have to offload other titles. That could be painful. He has a personal attachment to Metro. The idea for a London freesheet was first dreamed up by his father, who gave him the task of delivering it.There have been recent cuts at Metro, which some staff fear is a precursor to a sale. The i Paper also underwent a recent restructure. DMGT figures still feel confident they have a good case for taking on the Telegraph without offloading other titles.Rothermere has promised to keep the Telegraph and Mail titles editorially separate, regarding them as serving different audiences – broadsheet and mid-market. However, there are concerns inside both titles over cuts and the longer-term plans, given the state of the newspaper industry.View image in fullscreenRothermere’s personal attachment to Metro could make it painful for him if forced to offload it as part of the Telegraph deal.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianAgain, the family has shown a willingness to take drastic action when required. When Rothermere’s father was trying to rescue an ailing Daily Mail in 1971, he merged it with the Daily Sketch, brutally sacking hundreds of journalists in the process. Among them was Barry Norman, subsequently the BBC’s film critic. Walter Terry, the Mail’s political correspondent, was asked to hand out the redundancy letters because everybody liked him.The Mail made internal redundancies earlier this year, following greater integration of the paper and online product.However, DeGroote said there were huge backroom savings to be found before newsrooms were touched. “I don’t think they’re going to slash and burn at all, because the journalism is quite different across the two brands. I don’t see there being huge personnel cuts. But the back end of any media organisation will have meaningful procurement benefits.”Nandy has requested that DMGT and RedBird IMI submit the proposed deal to the government within three weeks, but the outstanding issues will ensure the saga rumbles on well into next year.“A company that owns the Mail and the Telegraph would have the scale to give both papers a better chance of surviving,” said Dacre. “But, even then, such a company would be a pygmy compared to the giant internet platforms and the BBC from whom most people today get their news. And that news is indisputably, I would argue, presented through a liberal prism. Now that’s a monopoly the regulators would do well to address.”Vere, 31, Rothermere’s eldest son, is already being groomed to take control of the family empire, holding a senior role in DMGT’s media business. Whether his responsibilities will include control of the Telegraph is the next great chapter in the Rothermere media saga."

There was no bitter aftertaste, no astringent sting at the back of the tongue. If anything, she thought in passing, the free shots she and her friends were drinking at a hostel bar inLaoshad probably been watered down – she wasn’t detecting a strong vodka flavour through the veil of Sprite she had mixed it with.All in all, Clarke remembers drinking about five of those shots, sitting with her best friend, Simone White, and a crowd of others at the hostel’s happy hour. CCTV footage shows the group laughing in the warm air of the open bar in the town of Vang Vieng, green and red lights dancing over their shoulders.By the next evening, they were in hospital. Shortly afterward, White was dead.View image in fullscreenPhoto taken by Clarke of shots being poured.Photograph: Bethany ClarkeClarke describes the awful aftermath of those drinks in blunt, matter-of-fact detail. Waking up, with what they assumed were grinding hangovers. A tour-bus ride where those symptoms grew worse, ending with White vomiting and Clarke fainting, hitting her head. The debate over whether it was food poisoning, a hangover, a virus. Someone in the group finally deciding it was time to find a hospital. The gradual, creeping realisation, as they waited in the ward, that something was badly wrong, that White in particular was getting sicker. Hearing her breathing shift to short gasps. The news that her brain was swelling, crushing into her skull. Finally, her life support being turned off.“That was 21 November, so a year ago, that they turned the machine off,” Clarke, who is from the UK but living in Brisbane, said. “It was honestly just a living nightmare.”White, also British, was one of six tourists who died in the 2024 Laos poisoning, after consuming drinks contaminated with methanol – a cheap, deadly relative to ethanol. In places where spirits are easily available on the black market, poorly regulated, expensive relative to income, or inaccessible because of legal and cultural taboos, it is increasingly finding its way into the alcohol supply chain – with catastrophic consequences. A lethal dose is 30ml. As little as 10ml can cause irreversible blindness.Quick GuideWhat is methanol poisoning and how do you recognise it?ShowWhat is methanol poisoning?Methanol is a poisonous form of 'industrial alcohol' that is very difficult to distinguish from ethanol – the alcohol that can be drunk. It is sometimes mixed into drinking alcohol as a cheap filler. Methanol is not toxic itself, but as the body metabolises it, it produces formaldehyde and formic acid. These toxic compounds turn the blood acidic, attacking the nervous system, organs and brain. About 20-40% of untreated cases are fatal. Even a small amount can be dangerous: 30ml, less than a shot glass, can be a deadly dose.How do you recognise it?Methanol symptoms often do not manifest until 12-24 hours after ingestion. Symptoms include vomiting, loss of balance, impaired judgement and drowsiness, escalating to vision changes (blurriness, tunnel vision, 'snow' or blindness), hyperventilation, convulsions, coma and death. Unlike a hangover, methanol symptoms will typically grow  worse over time.While labelled spirits are sometimes contaminated with methanol, the highest risk comes from alcohol that is unlabelled, hidden-market, or very cheap.What should you do if you suspect it?Anyone who suspects methanol poisoning should seek immediate attention at a hospital. If hospitals are not immediately accessible, the person should drink uncontaminated alcohol, as ethanol halts methanol's conversion into toxic compounds, says Dr Knut Erik Hovda, an international expert in methanol poisoning. Beer, wine or spirits will work. While ethanol is an effective antidote to methanol, it is difficult to correctly dose over time, so getting  proper medical care as soon as possible is still crucial.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Bethany and at least six others survived, one of them blinded by the toxin’s attack on the optic nerve, and she is nowcampaigning for better awarenessof the dangers of methanol. Their case was high profile, but experts say it is just one manifestation of an enormous global problem, occurring mostly out of the spotlight, untracked and unreported.“This is a hidden crisis,” said Knut Erik Hovda, a doctor and professor at the University of Oslo, and an international expert on methanol poisoning outbreaks. “It’s huge, and it’s forgotten – it keeps just disappearing, and then it crops up again in a different place, when you have your guard down.”This month, the UK government issued travel warnings for 11 additional countries where travellers face the risk of methanol poisoning, citing “a rise in cases of death and serious illness”. Those additions brought the total number of countries on the warning list to 38. But methanol poisonings have struck around the world. Data compiled by a team from Oslo university hospital and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)has documentedsuspected methanol poisoning incidents from almost 80 countries. The database covers more than 1,000 poisoning incidents, 41,000 poisoned people and 14,600 people dead.Global map of poisoningsThose documented cases were “only the tip of the iceberg”, Hovda said. Many outbreaks are never identified as methanol poisoning, or are not reported. In countries where alcohol is illegal or taboo, victims may be reluctant to seek treatment. Methanol poisoning can be tricky to identify: symptoms sometimes don’t set in until a day or two after consumption, so people don’t connect their illness with the drink. Other than the distinctive blindness and vision changes that sometimes occur, the symptoms of vomiting, dizziness and hyperventilation can resemble other illnesses, leading medical professionals astray. “We call it the big imitator,” said Hovda. And in hospitals around the world, outbreaks are sporadic enough that institutional knowledge of methanol quickly fades.The problem is also being compounded by misconceptions about methanol – including that poisonings happen only through home-brewed liquor. While unbranded spirits are a definite risk factor, a number of recent outbreaks have also been linked to contaminated official alcohol supply chains, where methanol is being added to sealed bottles of spirits and finding its way on to the mass market.View image in fullscreenWhite was one of six tourists who died in the 2024 Laos poisoning.Photograph: Bethany ClarkeIn São Paulo,Brazil, in the early hours of 31 August, the lift maintenance technician Rafael dos Anjos Martins Silva, 27, and four friends bought two bottles of gin, coconut water and energy drinks from an off-licence.They drank at Silva’s house, and when the night ended, went home. Silva slept through the entire next day; that evening, he woke up vomiting, with intense abdominal pain. Shortly afterwards, he lost his sight.His parents rushed him to the hospital. “He was screaming, moaning in pain,” said his mother, Helena dos Anjos Martins, 46. Before they even reached the hospital, her son had stopped responding. “His last breath was in my arms,” said Martins.View image in fullscreenRafael dos Anjos Martins Silva.Photograph: InstagramSilva fell into a coma and spent 53 days in hospital before suffering a cardiac arrest and dying on 23 October. His is one of 16 confirmed deaths and 46 poisonings from methanol in Brazil this year – well above the historical annual average of about 20 cases. The police detected methanol in the bottle of gin, but are still trying to trace the origin of the outbreak. An operation in São Paulo has linked some of the cases to clandestine alcohol factories that had bought methanol from fuel stations.Silva’s case was among the first to emerge, at a time when hospitals across the country were facing ashortageof pharmaceutical ethanol used as an antidote. “Brazil failed my family,” said his mother. “Brazil didn’t give it the importance it should have at the start.”Part of the tragedy of mass deaths from methanol is that, while the poisonings can be challenging to identify, they are relatively simple to treat.“As long as I get hold of you early enough, I can make sure you walk out of my hospital within a couple of days and be completely fine,” Hovda said. There are two effective antidotes: fomepizole, which is the best clinical treatment but often costs more than $1,000 (£750) a dose. Or – counterintuitively – alcohol, which interrupts the body’s process of converting methanol into toxic formic acid, allowing it to gradually be released by the body. In one outbreak in Kenya, Hovda recalls setting up 35 men in a row in the ward, and serving them an alcoholic drink every two hours. Five were blind before treatment started, but all survived.View image in fullscreenHovda treating patients during a deadly methanol outbreak in Kenya.Photograph: MSF/Knut Erik HovdaMethanol toxicity can cause brain damage, blindness and death within days. That means hospitals, health workers and governments need to be prepared with trained staff, antidotes and public warnings about contaminated supply. And while awareness campaigns are primarily focused on risks to western tourists, the biggest death toll by far is among local populations – typically those who are poor or disenfranchised.Chart on suspected methanol poisoning deathsAbout 10,000 people have been recorded as killed by methanol poisoning in Iran over the past two decades, according to the MSF database – a rolling public health crisis that has barely touched international headlines. Another 6,500 were recorded in India, where outbreaks are hitting the rural poor. Some of the biggest outbreaks of the past year have been inTurkey, where a series of poisonings have killed more than 160 people.I was 19 and on the trip of a lifetime – then I drank a cocktail laced with methanolRead moreThere, taboos and high prices work in tandem to create a perfect environment for an outbreak. Under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose whose AKP party often makes appeals to Islamic models of morality, the Turkish government has increased taxes on spirits and banned advertising of alcoholic beverages. Ozgur Aybas, the head of the Turkish Tekel (liquor) stores platform, said via WhatsApp: “Nowhere else in the world does the tax on a product exceed the price of the product itself. Here it is three, five, even 10 times higher. Under these conditions, is it really surprising that people sell, provide, or produce illegal alcohol?”A bottle of raki, an anise-flavoured spirit similar to ouzo, can cost £28 in a grocery store – a high price in Turkey, where the monthly minimum wage is about £470. For most people, it is out of reach, and a parallel market of illicit sellers is thriving.“We’re not shocked any more when we see in the news that 10 people died in a restaurant,” says Gökhan Genç, a 36-year-old Ankara resident. “It’s become normalised.”Explore more on these topicsAlcoholHealthLaosBrazilIranTurkeyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They paid tribute to the “brilliance and humanity” of his work and “his wit, his irreverence, his generosity of spirit and his profound love of the English language”.The Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger was among those remembering a “giant” of theatre who was “highly intellectual and very funny in all his plays and scripts”. “He loved classical and popular music alike which often featured in his huge body of work,” Jagger said. “He was an amusing and a quietly sardonic friend and companion. I will always miss him.”Nicholas Hytner, who directed Stoppard’s play The Hard Problem at the NationalTheatrein London 10 years ago, said: “Tom’s towering achievements came with an astonishing generosity and curiosity about the work of others. His shelves were stacked with the work of other playwrights. He seemed to see everything, and was precise and thrilling when he wrote in appreciation of the things he liked.“He was a great writer and a legendary host but those of us lucky enough to know him and work with him will remember him as an exceptional enhancer of the lives he touched.”The Society of London Theatre announced thatWest Endtheatres will dim their lights for two minutes on Tuesday in remembrance. Its president, Kash Bennett, said Stoppard’s “extraordinary voice reshaped modern theatre, combining intellectual daring, emotional depth and razor-sharp wit in work that challenged, moved and delighted audiences across generations”.Ina post on X, director Rupert Goold wrote: “Tom Stoppard’s magic was present in everything he wrote but he was also the kindest, most supportive, most generous, man.”Author Kathy Lette called him “one of the wittiest people I ever met” and saidon Xthat “a conversation with him left you reeling from irreverent and imaginative quip-lash”.One of a select band of writers from any discipline to earn his own adjective – “Stoppardian” – in the Oxford English Dictionary, he delighted in the most improbable juxtapositions: philosophy and gymnastics inJumpers(1972); early 19th-century landscape gardening and chaos theory in Arcadia (1993); rock music, dissident Czech academics and the love poetry of Sappho inRock ’n’ Roll(2006).A new Stoppard play has been an international event ever since Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, featuring two obscure Shakespearean courtiers, was spotted on the Edinburgh fringe in 1966 and developed by the National Theatre.With his restless imagination, Tom Stoppard showed us a mind on the moveRead moreHe combined more than 30 plays for the theatre with a steady stream of works for television and radio, and with screenplays including an adaptation of John le Carré’s The Russia House, Terry Gilliam’sBraziland a joint credit for the Oscar-winning screenplay ofShakespeare in Love.But his influence went far further than his on-screen credits would suggest: he was the go-to writer for blockbusters in need of a bit of spit and polish (includingIndiana Jones and the Last Crusadeand the Star Wars adventure Revenge of the Sith). Steven Spielberg once dragged him out of the shower with an urgent phone call to discuss a problem withSchindler’s List.Stoppard was thrice married and famously sociable. The playwright Simon Gray captured something of his charmed life when he quipped: “It is actually one of Tom’s achievements that one envies him nothing, except possibly his looks, his talents, his money and his luck. To be so enviable without being envied is pretty enviable, when you think about it.”His early childhood was not auspicious. Born Tomáš Straussler in Czechoslovakia, he was not yet two years old when his Jewish parents fled the Nazi invasion of 1939 for Singapore. Three years later, he was evacuated to India with his mother and brother, leaving his father behind to a fatal confrontation with the Japanese occupation as an army medical officer. After his father’s death, his mother married a British army major, Kenneth Stoppard, who adopted the boys and moved the family back to England after the war.Where to start with Tom Stoppard: from Brazil to LeopoldstadtRead moreStoppard left school at 17, initially to become a journalist on the Western Daily Press in Bristol. After a couple of years of playing around with short radio plays, his first stage play was picked up for the theatre in Hamburg and television in the UK. Moving to London, he wrote theatre reviews under the Evelyn Waugh-inspired pseudonym William Boot, before a Ford Foundation grant enabled him to escape to Berlin to devote himself to the idea that would become Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.Though the intellectual pyrotechnics and bravura theatricality of his early work led some to dismiss him as more head than heart, that began to change with The Real Thing, a meditation on the pain of infidelity and the unstable relationship between art and life, which Michael Billington ranked among the101 greatest playsever written. Premiered in the West End in 1982, it starred Felicity Kendal and Roger Rees in roles that were reprised on Broadway by Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close.During the 15 years after The Real Thing, he hit the top of his game. According to hisbiographerHermione Lee, Stoppard himself felt thatArcadia(1993) was probably his best play, whileThe Invention of Love(1997) – about the poet AE Housman – was his favourite. Only Hapgood (1988) fell foul of the old charge that it was too clever by half, with its combination of spy story and particle theory, though it was widely felt to be vindicated by a 2015 revival at Hampstead theatre.For all his personal sociability, as a writer Stoppard was a loner who did not share the left-leaning political sympathies of his playwriting contemporaries. Describing himself as a “timid libertarian” and “an honorary Englishman”, he was an admirer of Margaret Thatcher and, in 1984, signed a letter of support for the US invasion of Grenada. He was awarded a CBE in 1978 and was knighted in 1997. In 2013, he was awarded thePEN Pinter prizefor his “determination to tell things as they are”.He returned often to his central European origins, with works anatomising the cold war, including Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (1977), commissioned by André Previn for performance with a full onstage orchestra, and his great television play Professional Foul, which was screened in the same year. The latter was dedicated to his friend Václav Havel, who at the time was in and out of jail.He was in his 50s before he discovered the truth about his Jewish origins, and into his 80s by the time the knowledge metabolised into his late-period masterpieceLeopoldstadt, which followed a once-prosperous Viennese family from 1899 to 1955.Explore more on these topicsTom StoppardTheatreCzech RepublicRadioComedyEuropeBroadwaynewsShareReuse this content"

Delegates in Liverpool will choose between electing a sole leader or a collective of lay members – those not already serving as MPs or councillors.The party has been beset by infighting since plans for it were first announced in July after Sultana announced her defection from Labour, saying she and Corbyn would co-lead a new political organisation. Allies of Corbyn were quick to brief that a final decision had not been made.The pair appeared to strike a fragile peace, with Sultanalikening their relationship to that of Noel and Liam Gallagher. Corbyn said on Saturday that he would “probably favour the single leadership model” but would “live with whatever [members] decide on”.However, her decision to skip the first day of proceedings is likely to go down badly with Corbyn and his aides. It is understood that one of her supporters, James Giles, a councillor in Kingston, was barred from entering the conference centre. Other members were expelled on Friday over alleged membership of the Socialist Workers party.Corbyn told journalists on Saturday that entry to Your Party was granted on the condition members were not aligned with other parties registered with the Electoral Commission.He added: “The Socialist Workers party is registered with the Electoral Commission, therefore it is another party. I think to call it a purge is a bit of exaggeration quite honestly.”It was later clarified that the Socialist Workers party is not registered with the Electoral Commission.A spokesperson for Sultana said: “Zarah met members outside conference and condemned the recent expulsions. This witch-hunt is indefensible. We must build a party that welcomes all socialists.“She will not be entering the conference hall today.” It is understood Sultana will attend the conference on Sunday to deliver a planned speech.A Your Party spokesperson said: “These claims are false. Members of another national political party signed up to Your Party in contravention of clearly stated membership rules – and these rules were enforced.”Speaking before Sultana announced her boycott, Corbyn had hinted to journalists that he was ready to stand as leader in a contest. “I’m very happy to serve the party in whatever capacity they decide they want me to serve,”he said.Sultana said she supported collective leadership in the absence of the option for two co-leaders. She said: “I’ve publicly supported a co-leadership model. The fact it hasn’t been given to members as an option to vote on is regrettable, and the fact that has been decided by a faceless, nameless bureaucrat is quite concerning.”She said she was “championing collective leadership” because she felt it offered “maximum member democracy”.“I don’t think movements should be led by sole personalities. I think you have to represent the broad mass movement,” she said. “That allows responsibility to be shared and more people’s ideas to be listened to. It strengthens the movement. With that, comes a structure which has a parliamentary convener. They are also elected by the membership.“Should the members choose sole leadership, I would consider throwing my hat in the ring. I will then respect whatever the members decide and completely ride in behind that.”Corbyn and Sultana said they would consider electoral pacts with other leftwing parties, including the Greens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That has to be the guiding principle for all of us who want to stop fascism.”Corbyn said it “would essentially be a decision for the local branches of Your Party” to judge what was best in their area, but he that he would not rule out cooperating with the Green party, which has enjoyed a rise in popularity under its new leader, Zack Polanski.Tensions between Corbyn, the former Labour leader who is now an independent MP for Islington North, and Sultana, who represents Coventry South, escalated when Sultana launched a membership portal, collecting about £800,000 in donations and reams of members’ data.Sultana said on Saturday that £600,000 had already been transferred from a holding company to Your Party and that the remainder of the money would be sent when liabilities had been processed.She said she was now getting on “really well” with Corbyn and that the pair had been communicating about the conference, which she said they wanted to be “a positive, joyful experience where members feel empowered”.‘We had six MPs and four factions’: inside Your Party’s toxic power strugglesRead moreHowever, tensions between Sultana and key allies of Corbyn persist. Relations with his former chief of staff Karie Murphy are believed to be particularly strained.Sultana admitted there was still a “toxic culture” in Your Party, which had led to “bullying, intimidation and smears” and “acts of deliberate sabotage”.She said: “I can definitely say that toxic culture I’ve experienced needs to be rooted out. I would say that is directly from the handbook of the Labour right. It’s shocking to experience in a new leftwing, socialist party. We do need to dismantle that culture.“I think there are people who are around Jeremy – not Jeremy himself – who have learned the wrong lessons from their time in the Labour party, where they have been on the wrong end of smears, of sabotage, attacks in the rightwing press … they are now using the same tactics when really we should have a healthy climate of being able to debate and disagree.”In his speech on Saturday, Corbyn called for unity. “As a party, we’ve got to come together and be united, because division and disunity will not serve the interests of the people that we want to represent,” he said.He also called for “public, democratic ownership” of the water industry, led a chant of “free, free Palestine” and urged party members to “campaign forevermore for real socialism and real social justice”.Explore more on these topicsJeremy CorbynZarah SultananewsShareReuse this content"

There should not be a single person born in Pakistan in the UK House of Commons.”White, who has more than 18,000 followers onX, is one of a new generation of activists seeking to inject far-right language into public debate.

A spokesperson said: “Comments expressed on personal social media accounts by individuals who have appeared on our platforms do not reflect the views or values of the channel.”Tell Mama, a national project which records and measures anti-Muslim incidents, is to write to GB News to seek an explanation. “Anyone espousing such views essentially marginalises and takes out of our political life anyone who has an international heritage.

This will deal a significant blow to Russian oil transportation,” the official said in a written statement.Ukraine has been attacking Russian oil refineries for months, using long-range aerial drones to strike far behind the frontlines of Moscow’s full-scale war against Ukraine.The strikes on the tankers represent a different kind of attack. Kyiv has repeatedly called on the west to take real action against Russia’s so-called “shadow fleet”, which the Ukrainian government says is helping Moscow export large quantities of oil and fund its war in Ukraine despite western sanctions. The fleet of hundreds of often ageing, unregulated vessels came to prominence after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, bypassing western sanctions aimed at reducing Moscow’s oil revenue.Separately, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which handles more than 1% of global oil, said on Saturday it halted operations after a mooring at Russia’s Black Sea terminal was significantly damaged by a Ukrainian naval drone attack.CPC exports mainly from Kazakhstan via Russia and the Black Sea terminal. Kazakhstan called the attack unacceptable.Naval drones are uncrewed speedboats packed with explosives that sail towards their targets before detonating. They played a prominent role in Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the Black Sea, helping to push back Russia’s large fleet of warships.The 274-metre-long tanker Kairos suffered an explosion and caught fire on Friday while en route from Egypt to Russia, Turkey’s transport ministry said. The crew was evacuated by rescue boats while efforts to extinguish the fire continued, it said.The Virat was reportedly struck about 35 nautical miles offshore, further east in the Black Sea, the ministry said. That ship was attacked again on Saturday by unmanned vessels, sustaining minor damage to its starboard side above the waterline, the ministry added. It said the vessel was in stable condition and the crew in good health.Both the Kairos and Virat are on a list of ships subject to sanctions imposed against Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, according to LSEG data.Turkey voiced concern over the attacks, saying the incidents took place in its exclusive economic zone and posed serious safety risks.Ankara is in contact with relevant parties to prevent the war from spreading in the Black Sea and to protect the country’s economic interests and operations in the region, Turkish foreign ministry spokesperson Öncü Keçeli said in a post on X.The Ukrainian official did not say when the Ukrainian strikes took place.There was no public comment from Russia.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The latest figures published by theIsraeli human rights group B’Tselemsaid that as of the end of September the Israel Prison Service was holding 3,474 Palestinians in “administrative detention”, meaning without trial.‘Cruellest forms of torture’: freed Palestinians describe horrors of Israeli jailRead moreThe new UN report, covering a two-year period since the beginning of the Gaza war on 7 October 2023, draws attention to the “high proportion of children who are currently detained without charge or on remand”, noting the age of criminal responsibility imposed by Israel is 12, and that children younger than 12 have also been detained.Children categorised as security prisoners, the report says, “have severe restrictions on family contact, may be held in solitary confinement, and do not have access to education, in violation of international standards”. It appeals to Israel to amend its legislation so that solitary confinement is not used against children.The UN committee, which was established to monitor implementation of the 1984 UN convention against torture, goes further, arguing that the daily imposition of Israeli policies in occupied Palestine, taken as a whole, “may amount to torture”.The report said 75 Palestinians had died in custody over the course of the Gaza war, during which detention conditions for Palestinians had undergone a “marked deterioration”. It found the death toll to be “abnormally high and appears to have exclusively affected the Palestinian detainee population”. It notes that “to date, no state officials have been held responsible or accountable for such deaths”.Israel’s government has repeatedly denied the use of torture. The UN committee heard evidence from representatives of the country’s foreign ministry, justice ministry and prison service who argued that prison conditions were adequate and subject to supervision.However, the committee pointed out that the inspector charged with investigating complaints on interrogations had brought “no criminal prosecutions for acts of torture and ill-treatment” over the past two years, despite widespread allegations of such practices.1:24Moment Israeli forces shoot dead surrendered Palestinians – video reportIt said that Israel had pointed to just one conviction for torture or ill-treatment in that two-year period, an apparent reference to anIsraeli soldier sentenced in Februarythis year for repeatedly attacking bound and blindfolded detainees from Gaza with his fists, a baton and his assault rifle. In that case, the committee found that the seven-month sentence “appears not to reflect the severity of the offence”.The report was published on a day when three Israeli border police officers were released after questioning overthe fatal shooting of two Palestinianswho had been detained in Jenin.Video of the incidenton Thursday evening showed the two men, Youssef Asasa and Mahmoud Abdallah, crawling out of a building. Asasa and Abdallah can be seen holding their hands up and lifting their shirts to show they are unarmed.The men, both claimed by Palestinian Islamic Jihad as fighters in its al-Quds Brigades, were detained for a few seconds by border police officers, including a bald-headed officer with a beard who appears in the video to take charge and kick both detainees before making a gesture, seemingly ushering them back inside the building. Seconds later Asasa and Abdallah were shot by the officers at a range of about 2 metres.According to Israeli media, the three border officers questioned on Friday about the incident claimed they “felt an immediate and tangible threat” to their lives. In their reported account of what happened the two detainees had refused to strip naked and had “put their hands in their pockets”, and then one of the men tried to “escape back into the building”.The video from the scene, the authenticity of which has not been disputed by the Israeli authorities, does not show any obvious resistance from the two men, nor does it show them with their hands in their pockets. They appear to be reluctant to re-enter the building under the apparent orders from the border police officer.The three border police officers were released after questioning on condition they did not discuss the case with others.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The government also said it demanded respect for its airspace and would not accept foreign orders or threats.Trump on Saturday, in a Truth Social post said: “To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.”Due to Trump’s announcement, all migrant deportation flights were “unilaterally suspended”, the Venezuelan government added. Deportation flights to Venezuela have been a significant point of contention for theTrump administration, as it continues to engage in its mass deportation program.The US defense department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.US strikes against alleged drug boats in theCaribbeanhave been under way for months, along with a US military buildup in the region, and Trump has authorized covert CIA operations in Venezuela.The president told military service members this week that the US would “very soon”begin land operationsto stop suspected Venezuelan drug traffickers.Last week, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned major airlines of a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over Venezuela due to a “worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around” the South American country.Venezuelarevoked operating rightsfor six major international airlines that had suspended flights to the country after the FAA warning.The Trump administration has accused the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, of involvement in drug trafficking, a charge he has denied.Maduro, in power since 2013, has said that Trump is seeking to oust him and that Venezuelan citizens and the military will resist any such attempt.US forces in the region have so far focused on counter-narcotics operations, although the assembled firepower far outweighs anything needed for them.They have carried out at least 21 strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific since September, killing at least 83 people.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaDonald TrumpTrump administrationCaribbeanUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

I understand the tactic but not much use if we can’t do any work until they get recruitment sorted.”Meanwhile, the government is advertising for up to four new commissioners to join Stephenson. The EHRC, which is required by statute to have between 10 and 15 commissioners, now has just eight, all but one of whom was appointed during the last Conservative government.Deputy chair and Scotland commissioner Lesley Sawers and commissioner Joanne Cash will also finish their terms on 30 November. Akua Reindorf ends her term on 31 December.It is understood that some Labour MPs as well as figures in the wider policy sector believe the current impasse is a distraction from other pressing issues, including the rise of the far right and its impact on the communities served by the EHRC.They have been encouraging applications for the commissioner roles from those they feel take a more nuanced approach to trans inclusion.One Labour backbencher said: “As these posts are coming up, it’s important to have that broad range of experience and expertise on the board, and within those discussions we’ve been saying please do encourage people from the trans community to consider it, or have you thought of applying?“That broad range was essential from when EHRC was first set up but may have been narrowed with more political appointments under the Conservatives.“When a group of us met some of the current board members and the current chair, we felt very strongly that an understanding of the impact of the supreme court ruling on the trans community wasn’t there.”Another Labour backbencher said they hoped more people would apply: “We need commissioners with real world experience of the issues they grapple with.”Stonewall said the arrival of the new chair and commissioners was an opportunity “to rebuild an EHRC that re-establishes fairness, balance, and respect at its core”.CEO Simon Blake said: “We are living in a time of uncertainty and turbulence for many; this is an opportunity to review the strategic approach of our National Human Rights Institute so everyone – including trans people – can benefit from the rights and freedoms the EHRC is constituted to protect and defend.”But Susan Smith of ForWomenScotland called on Phillipson to “stop prevaricating” over approving the EHRC guidance.“Trying to frustrate the release of the code or attempting to force the EHRC to misrepresent the legislation will not change the supreme court’s judgment,” she said.“If MPs are unhappy they have the capacity to amend or repeal the Equality Act, but as the majority of voters supported the ruling, they may realise this would impact their prospects for re-election.“The minister needs to stop prevaricating and put this to bed once and for all. During this period of16 days of activism against gender-based violence, the government should remember that women are half the population and our human right to dignity, privacy, and safety matters.”An EHRC spokesperson said: “Appointments to our board of commissioners are made by the minister for women and equalities through the standard public appointment process.“Our commissioners come from all walks of life and bring with them a breadth of skills, expertise and experience.“This diversity helps us make impartial and independent decisions, and ensures we continue to uphold the rights of all people in Britain, including trans people.”Explore more on these topicsGenderWomen's rights and gender equalityTransgenderScotlandEquality Act 2010Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)WomennewsShareReuse this content"

Rescuers also retrieved 47 bodies in Aceh, said Suharyanto, head of the National Disaster Management Agency.0:48Flash floods and landslides cause devastation in Indonesia – videoMore than 3,500 police were deployed to search for people still missing and help distribute aid to more than 28,400 who fled to temporary government shelters across the province.About 80,000 people have been evacuated and hundreds are still stranded in three provinces across Sumatra island, Indonesia’s western-most area, Suharyanto told a news conference, adding that a cloud-seeding operation would begin in West Sumatra to reduce the rainfall, most of which had already subsided by Saturday.InThailand, more than 1.4 million households – 3.8 million people – have been affected by the floods, the department of disaster prevention and mitigation said on Saturday.In southern Thailand, water levels reached 3 metres in Songkhla province and killed at least 145 people in one of the worst floods in a decade.The country’s death toll across eight provinces has risen to 162, the government said on Saturday.View image in fullscreenDamaged cars and motorbikes as flood waters begin to recede in Hat Yai, in southern Thailand’s Songkhla province.Photograph: Narong Sangnak/EPAWorkers at one hospital in hard-hit Hat Yai moved bodies into refrigerated trucks after the morgue exceeded capacity.The prime minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, visited a shelter for evacuees in the district on Friday and told reporters he acknowledged the government’s shortcomings in flood management.“I really have to apologise to them for letting this happen during the time I am in government,” he said in footage broadcast on AmarinTV.“The next step is to prevent the situation from deteriorating,” he added, announcing a two-week timeframe for the district’s clean-up.The Thai government rolled out relief measures for those affected by the flooding, including compensation of up to 2m baht ($62,000, £46,800) for households that lost family members.As flood waters receded, shop owner Rachane Remsringam picked through rubbish strewn between the aisles of his general goods store, lamenting hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses.His store, Madam Yong, was looted and vandalised in the wake of the disaster, he said.There has been growing public criticism of Thailand’s flood response and two local officials have been suspended over their alleged failures.An MP from the opposition People’s party criticised the administration, saying it “wrongly estimated the situation” and made “errors in handling the flood crisis”.One victim of the flood, Amphorn Kaeophengkro, told Reuters she and seven members of her family spent 48 hours perched atop a table, a window frame and a washing machine on the second floor of her home in the city of Hat Yai, which received 335mm (13 inches) of rain last Friday – its highest single-day tally in 300 years.“We weren’t thinking about anything else except surviving,” the 44-year-old told Reuters by candlelight, as her family began to clean their dwelling after the water had receded.Two people were killed inMalaysiaby flooding caused by heavy rain that left stretches of northern Perlis state under water.The annual monsoon season, typically between June and September, often brings heavy rain, triggering landslides and flash floods.A tropical storm has exacerbated conditions, and the tolls in Indonesia and Thailand rank among the highest in floods in those countries in recent years.Climate change has affected storm patterns, including the duration and intensity of the season, leading to heavier rainfall, flash flooding and stronger wind gusts.Reporting from Reuters and Agence France-Presse inPadang, IndonesiaExplore more on these topicsIndonesiaThailandMalaysiaFloodingExtreme weatherAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The bad news: passengers will no longer be able to get onboard.The rail regulator has axed one of Britain’s fastest and most lucrative intercity services, the 7am Avanti West Coast from Manchester Piccadilly toLondonEuston, as part of a timetable shake-up that will take effect in mid-December.What will heap on frustration for passengers, as well as the operator, is that the exact same train service will continue to run between the stations from 7am each weekday: crewed, fast and empty.Launch of East West Rail services to be delayed in row over guards on trainsRead moreThe train and staff still need to travel from Manchester as they are rostered to operate subsequent services out of Euston on the new December timetable, under rail’s complex planning.The bizarre situation is expected to continue for five months or more until the next timetable change in May, meaning the service could run empty more than 100 times. The move has left rail insiders fuming at the decision by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR).Business travellers from the north may mourn the end of the express train, non-stop after Stockport inGreater Manchesterand timed conveniently to arrive in the capital just before 9am. Revenue collectors even more so: current single fares on the peak-time service are priced at £193, rising to £290 for first class.The industry expert and rail writer Tony Miles said: “It will be on the platform – people will be able to see it, touch it, watch it leave. But they won’t be able to get on. The taxpayer will be paying five days a week for empty trains.”View image in fullscreenPassengers board an Avanti West Coast service at Manchester Piccadilly railway station.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe service began in 2008 when Virgin Trains ran intercity trains on the west coast mainline but was suspended during the coronavirus pandemic andAvanti’s subsequent troubles, and reinstated when Avanti returned to a full timetable in 2024.As the only service completing the journey so quickly, at one hour 59 minutes, it has long been a major marketing asset, allowing operators to advertise trains running between England’s capital and the northern city in less than two hours.Network Rail, as well as Avanti, supported the continuation of the service with passengers, arguing the train would be “using capacity regardless” on the network.A senior industry source said: “Peoplepaid a lot of moneyto get on that train. If we ever need justification for a guiding mind in the railway, this is the example.”The train has been removed as the regulator tries to ensure the overall reliability of the railway in the new timetable on 15 December. The new schedule will mainly affect the UK’s other major rail artery, the east coast mainline, but the industry is wary of any potential disruption after the widespread cancellations and delays sparked by the last comparable overhaul, theMay 2018 timetable fiasco.The ORR said the service was no longer feasible in the new timetable as newopen access trainservices, run by First Group’s Lumo to Stirling in Scotland, were due to start. Fare revenue will go to the private operator rather than the Department for Transport, as is the case under the Avanti contract.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They said: “We are disappointed with the Office of Rail and Road’s decision not to grant access rights from December for four weekday services that we currently operate, including the 07.00 from Manchester to London fast service, as well as requiring a Sunday service which currently runs from Holyhead to London to terminate at Crewe. This will clearly impact those customers who already use these services.”The ORR said: “Our decision on the Manchester-London service was based on robust evidence provided by Network Rail that adding services within firebreak paths on the west coast mainline would have a detrimental impact on performance. We identified that this service would run in one of those paths.“If Avanti operates the service as empty coaching stock, [it] can be run more flexibly – delayed or rerouted – than a booked passenger service. This can assist with performance management and service recovery during disruption.”Firebreak paths are planned gaps or unused time in the timetable to allow for disruption to services.Avanti will be running more services to the north-west overall under the new timetable, and other applications from open access companies on the line had been declined, the ORR said.The fastest trains linking Manchester and London will now take about 2 hours 15 minutes, with those wishing to arrive in the capital by 9am having to catch a 6.29am train.Northern business leaders hit out at the decision. Henri Murison, the chief executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said the ORR in backing open access was “denying business people in Manchester access to London on a vital fast peak service” and sacrificing revenue, adding: “Great British Railways’ future finances are being undermined by a regulator disregarding the interests of taxpayers, who will pick up the bill for this poor decision in the name of competition.”Explore more on these topicsRail industryWest coast mainlineManchesterLondonRail transportTransportNetwork RailnewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Fiona Goodall/Getty ImagesA country built on agriculture is seeing the sector change as the number of farms shrinks and it becomes harder for young people to buy landByShanti MathiasSat 29 Nov 2025 18.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 29 Nov 2025 19.19 ESTShareOn a farm south of Auckland, Cam Clayton breeds sheep and cattle – working alongside the dogs he’s trained since they were puppies. There, he looks out on knobbly hills and tree-filled gullies in Waikato, close to where he grew up.“I have the best office, with the best views,” says Clayton.The 30-year-old is part of a changing sector in New Zealand: data from the statistics agency shows the number of farms has beensteadily declining: from 70,336 in 2002, to 47,250 two decades later – a drop of 33%. The land area taken up by farming has shrunk too, by 15% over the same period.View image in fullscreenCam Clayton cleans equipment in the shed after morning milking.Photograph: Fiona Goodall/Getty ImagesHistorically an agricultural country, dairy, meat, kiwifruit and apples are still major exports forNew Zealand. While the number of farms has declined, some have grown from small holdings into big businesses. New Zealand’s farmer-owned dairy co-operative, Fonterra, has recently sold its consumer businesses to French dairy giant Lactalis for nearly NZ$4bn ($2.3bn).Yet while dairy fetches record prices, it’s difficult for young farmers like Clayton to follow the traditional path to farm ownership. In the past, young farmers would often run a farm owned by someone else in return for a share of the profits, while saving to purchase land of their own. But land is becoming more expensive; prospective farm owners have to save for longer, and look for other types of work to make money.“Someone buys the neighbour’s farm, then the next neighbour, suddenly you have a portfolio of five farms and Joe Bloggs the young farmer can’t buy a 150-cow farm to get started,” Clayton says, who leases the block he works on.“You have to be really passionate and in it for the long haul.”View image in fullscreenClayton walks fence lines with his dogs.Photograph: Fiona Goodall/Getty ImagesCheyne Gilooly is chief executive of the Young Farmers club, a 98-year old institution that connects people across New Zealand. Finding a way to buy land is a frequent topic of discussion at the dozens of clubs throughout the country which are open to people aged under 31 – fewer and fewer of whom own their farms.“The big challenge at the moment is helping people finance their way into farm or land ownership as land gets more expensive,” says Gilooly.Cam Lowery, 27, and his partner Poppy Mitchell, 25, are one year into holding a lease for Lowery’s parents farm near Milton, south of Dunedin. They have 2,700 sheep, as well as some cows, calves and hoggets – young sheep who haven’t been shorn.After going to university, Lowery worked as a shepherd across the South Island.“I just couldn’t see a way into farm ownership through shepherding,” he says. Kiwisaver, a government-supported retirement saving scheme, can be used for first home payments, but can’t be used to buy a farm.View image in fullscreenCam Lowery and Poppy Mitchell in New Zealand.Photograph: Cam Lowery and Poppy Mitchell“It’s hard to build equity off-farm,” Lowery says.For now, because the farm is owned by family, they are settled. Mitchell works as a physiotherapist in Dunedin during the week, an hour’s drive away. Lowery does all the farm work, with Mitchell’s help on weekends.“My days start at 7 or 8 am and I keep working until 7pm at the moment,” he says. The work is hard, but it feels worth doing, Mitchell adds.In Waikato, Clayton does a bit of everything: he helps on his parents’ dairy farm, manages a 600-hectare (1,480 acres) block of land, breeds and sells his cattle and sheep. It’s lots of casual work “just hopping around farms”. One day, he might be milking; the next, mustering ewes for a neighbour or inseminating cows.View image in fullscreenClayton moves sheep on his hill country lease block.Photograph: Fiona Goodall/Getty ImagesClayton was a recent finalist at the Bay of Plenty-Waikato Young Farmer of the Year contest. He will now compete against other regions in challenges including identifying horse tack, grading different types of wool and demonstrating his ability to communicate with dogs. A written test includes questions about plant varieties, agricultural legislation and irrigation.“It’s a broad spectrum, looking at all things rural,” Clayton says.The long-term plan is to own a farm with his partner, Emma. There’s lots to learn, he says but loves the variety of life on the land.“I can’t get out of bed fast enough to see what challenges the day will throw at me,” he says.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandFarmingAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When his friend won victory in the 2019 presidential election, Yermak went with him into politics, first as a foreign policy adviser and then, a year later, as chief of staff.Yermak appeared to become untouchable as he got ever closer to the president during the years of full-scale war. He ran the most sensitive tracks of Ukraine’s foreign policy, speaking regularly with national security advisers from allied countries and was in charge of the team working on peace negotiations.He was also Zelenskyy’s chief political fixer, often giving orders to ministers, and was widely seen as the personification of the president’s will. It was Yermak whotravelled to London to meet former army commander Valerii Zaluzhnyi, widely seen as the most threatening political challenger to Zelenskyy, and pitched Zaluzhnyi to join Zelenskyy’s team.Few people in the Ukrainian elite liked Yermak, but many expressed grudging admiration for his work ethic and his ruthless scheming. Some felt that the level of control, unusual in a democracy, was justified by the wartime context. Additionally, his role as a hate figure often helped to protect Zelenskyy.Even as Yermak’s apartment was searched on Friday, few expected it to push him out of office, as a broad understanding had developed that Zelenskyy was unlikely to sacrifice his most trusted aide at any cost.Although Yermak has not been charged with anything at this point, the anti-corruption investigation threatened to dominate the news agenda and lead to a full-blown crisis, amidgrowing public discontent over corruption.Zelenskyy’s approval rating had already taken a severe hit over the scandal. On Saturday, the Ukrainska Pravda outlet reported via sources that investigators had seized several laptops and mobile phones from Yermak’s apartment for analysis.“For Zelenskyy, it would have been a hard decision to take, he understood the political need but was psychologically dependent on Yermak,” said Fesenko, who suggested it was most likely that Yermak’s resignation had been his own decision and not a case of Zelenskyy ordering him to go. “I think Yermak understood that if he goes down, he’ll bring Zelenskyy down with him, and decided to sacrifice himself to save Zelenskyy.”As always after the downfall of a powerful political figure, the readjustment period could get messy. Some of Yermak’s loyal acolytes will now fear for their jobs, while many others in the elite will breathe a sigh of relief, and will be hoping to gain more direct access to the president.“Yermak was gatekeeping not only the president’s contacts with the outside world but also the information getting through to the president,” said Olena Prokopenko, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Others who fell foul of Yermak or were seen to be growing too popular were unceremoniously fired.Zelenskyy is expected to announce a replacement imminently. Most of the names that have been floated so far are those from the president’s inner circle, but whoever is chosen is unlikely to have anything like the same power as Yermak, at least initially.This could prove challenging for a weakened Zelenskyy, especially if further revelations follow from the corruption investigation. Alternatively, it could give his presidency, already extended by more than a year from its planned endpoint because of the impossibility of holding elections during martial law, the influx of fresh ideas and more consensual decision-making that many have been calling for.“There’s a very strong demand in Ukrainian society for the revision of the social contract between the president and the people, and for restructuring the relationship between president and the cabinet and parliament,” said Prokopenko.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

But when might this tip over into something a little less healthy?Nicole MadiganSat 29 Nov 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 29 Nov 2025 19.21 ESTShareFor months after her relationship ended, Anna* couldn’t stop thinking about him.Each morning she’d wake with a jolt of grief; an intense, almost physical feeling that morphed into thoughts of him that consumed nearly every waking hour.Most nights she fell asleep playing mental reruns of conversations and imagined reconciliations in her mind.For many people, longing like this sits within the broad terrain of ordinary romantic yearning. The kind often lamented in poetry, music and film. But for Anna, what began as familiar ache slowly intensified, becoming almost unbearable.“It felt invasive,” she says. “Like my own mind was stalking me.”At first Anna thought she was simply struggling to move on from her ex-partner. But when the obsessive thoughts escalated, she sought help from her therapist. This wasn’t just ordinary longing, the therapist told her. This was limerence.What happens when love tips over into the infatuated state of ‘limerence’?Read moreThe term was coined in the 1970s by the psychologist Dorothy Tennov, who documentedpeople experiencing overwhelming, involuntary infatuation. Half a century later, the concept is resurfacing, amplified by technology, loneliness and the therapeutic language now embedded in everyday culture. Limerence is not a clinical diagnosis, nor is it recognised in the DSM-5, the main reference guide for mental health and brain conditions; it’s a descriptive concept rather than a disorder.Orly Miller, a psychologist and the author of Limerence: The Psychopathology of Loving Too Much, to be published next month,describes it as “an intense psychological state of obsessive longing for another person”.“It’s characterised by intrusive thoughts, emotional dependency and a powerful desire for reciprocation,” she explains. “Unlike ordinary attraction or infatuation, limerence involves obsession, emotional volatility and disruption to daily life.”She adds: “In today’s digital world, uncertainty and intermittent contact – the very conditions that feed limerence – are everywhere. Social media keeps people hovering on the edge of connection, sustaining fantasy and emotional ambiguity.”The cycle can look like compulsion: constantly checking phones, replaying memories, idealising moments and imagining future encounters. “It’s not just in the head,” Miller says. “It’s a full-body stress response. The nervous system becomes dysregulated, swinging between excitement and panic.”Associate Prof Sam Shpall, who teaches moral philosophy at the University of Sydney, cautions against seeing limerence only as pathology.“Tennov rejected the view that limerence is inherently unhealthy,” he says. “It’s a distinctive form of human longing, transformative and sometimes destabilising, yes, but not necessarily bad …“It’s a perennial theme in literature and art – the ecstasy and agony of this special form of desire for someone who may or may not want you.”The experience reveals something about the shape of our vulnerability and our yearning to be seenSam Shpall, philosopherLimerence overlaps with what researchers call passionate love, a normal, often intense stage of early romantic development that is often likened to addiction.Dr Emma Marshall, the deputy director of Deakin University’s Science of AdultRelationshipsLab, says passionate love is a common and intense experience.“Passionate love should be adaptive and beneficial for relationships – passionate love should facilitate the forming of a secure attachment.”Marshall notes that while Tennov’s limerence theory has not been frequently studied, related concepts in relationship science, such as obsessive romantic love or “mania love”, shows that passionate love becomes concerning when it “becomes an obsession that disrupts daily functioning, wellbeing and occurs within unsatisfying and unhealthy relationships”.In moderate forms, limerence can be benign, even creative, Miller says. But when fantasy replaces reality, it can cause profound disconnection.“Fantasy offers comfort,” she argues, “but it distances you from reality and from yourself. The limerent object becomes a screen on to which we project everything we long for …“People may believe they’ve found a soulmate or twin flame. Yet what they’re really encountering are disowned parts of themselves.”The clinical research is still lacking but Marshall says limerence is thought to be fuelled by uncertainty, andis believed to be different from other feelings because “the experience is uncontrollable”.“If the passionate love is not reciprocated, it of course brings strong and intense negative feelings, but these should dissipate over time, especially when new people are found to meet relationship needs.”Phoebe Rogers, a clinical psychologist, says some people may be more vulnerable to these experiences. “Those who have experienced trauma, a one-sided, unrequited love was often modelled to them early in life; or unsafe, unhealthy forms of love,” she says. “Those with a more insecure attachment style are thought to be more at risk.”Limerence becomes unhealthy when it interferes with work, relationships or self-esteem.“If thoughts of the other dominate your life, if you’re in distress and can’t stop despite trying, that’s when help is needed,” Miller says.Therapy can help individuals regulate emotions, recognise idealisation and understand the attachment wounds that fuel obsession.The romance of the chase“Art and popular music routinely frame persistence as virtue,” Shpall says. “In reality, persistence against stated boundaries is a reliable marker of harm. Limerence doesn’t excuse it.”Miller agrees: “We’ve been taught that the highest form of love is intensity. Films, music and even self-help culture romanticise the chase, the longing, the pain. But true intimacy is about safety and reciprocity, not emotional chaos.”I want to start dating casually. How do I turn off the illogical, hopelessly romantic part of my brain? | Leading questionsRead moreFor some, the forces that heighten connection, such as proximity, technology, and emotional uncertainty, can blur boundaries. What begins as longing can, under stress or rejection, slip into repeated contact or attempts to re-establish closeness in ways that cross lines, such as stalking.Miller stresses that limerence is not the same as stalking or erotomania, a psychological condition associated with some types of stalking.“In erotomania, a person holds a fixed delusion that the other loves them,” she says. “Limerent people usually know their feelings may not be reciprocated. Their behaviour, like repeatedly checking someone’s social media, is driven by anxiety, not by control or malice.”Recognising limerence for what it is can be liberating, Miller says. “When people realise this isn’t love, this is limerence, they start to reclaim their energy.”“They can ask what is this longing really about? Often it points to neglected parts of the self – unmet needs for validation, safety or excitement.”Rogers agrees that limerence often reflects unmet needs. “We all have a desire, longing for love, connection, closeness, security with another,” she says. “Often it’s meeting a deeper, core need.”Where popular psychology tends to pathologise limerence, philosophers like Shpall see in it clues about human meaning. “To experience limerence is to confront desire in one of its rawest forms,” he says.“The experience reveals something about the shape of our vulnerability and our yearning to be seen. It is too common and too commonly valued to be conceptualised as merely a problem.“Maybe the goal isn’t to eliminate limerence but to cultivate it wisely – to appreciate the intensity of human feeling without being consumed by it.”* Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsRelationshipsMental healthHealth (Australia news)PsychologyPhilosophyHealth (Society)featuresShareReuse this content"

For two decades I dedicated my life to the mountains, climbing some of the world’s highest peaks including Everest.In early 2022 my marriage ended and I threw myself completely into my dream of climbing the world’s 14 highest peaks without supplemental oxygen. By September I reached Manaslu base camp inNepal. I was focused on the mountain ahead, not on love.View image in fullscreenAllie and Mikel in Manaslu in 2023.Photograph: Austin SchmitzThat’s where I met Mikel. He was working at base camp as a guide, helping his client while I climbed with another Sherpa. For days it poured with rain and none of us could move higher. We had to wait out the weather. Mikel kept stealing my umbrella and teasing me about it. I loved his free spirit – he was confident, outgoing, funny and unafraid to speak his mind. He had a bright, cheeky energy and made everyone around him laugh.One night we were sitting in the dining tent watching Nepali music clips on his phone. The rain pattered on the tent roof, the glow from his screen lit up his smile and I felt an unexpected warmth. At some point we kissed. Later that night he came to my tent. Because he was working, he had to slip out before dawn so no one would know.For a while it was our secret – a stolen kiss, a quiet laugh across the camp, whispered conversations beneath the sound of rain. It was tender but complicated. I was newly separated and Mikel is 15 years younger than me. I didn’t know if it was real or a fleeting mountain romance.The following year I was in Pakistan, preparing to climb K2, and Mikel was there too, guiding another client. When I landed in Skardu he met me at the airport. We went back to the hotel where he was staying with another Sherpa and immediately decided we would share a room, just the two of us. That was the moment we decided not to hide any more. We were simply together and everyone knew.View image in fullscreenOn top of Tserko Ri in Nepal, 2024At first I was afraid of what people might think – of our age gap, of how different our worlds seemed. But then I realised that, out of all the people on the planet, we had found each other. It is an unlikely love but the truest love I have ever known.Since then we’ve climbed seven 8,000-metre peaks together. Mikel is devoted to helping me achieve my dream. On the mountain he does everything he can to keep me safe: carrying heavy loads, making hard decisions and calmly guiding me. We live an adventurous life but when we are together we are at peace. Nothing feels too hard for us, not even scaling the highest peaks on Earth.View image in fullscreenThe couple on a hotel rooftop in Kathmandu, 2024.Photograph: Sammy ZammitWe have a little saying: “I love me, you love you, we love each other, and we both love the mountain.” It reminds us that we share an even greater love.Follow Allie Pepper’s journeyto summit all 14 8,000-metre peaks without supplemental oxygenTell us the moment you knewShare your experienceShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

First of all, leaf blowers.A horrible, horrible invention. I didn’t even know about them until like 20 years ago when I rented a house in the country. I was shocked! I live inNew YorkCity, we don’t have leaf problems. We have every other kind of problem. When I was a kid, we had leaf raking. Which is quiet. Leaf blowers are the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen. First of all, they are incredibly noisy. And second of all, 10 minutes after you use it, that big leaf blower in the sky blows them all back. It’s a very stupid invention.Dinner parties.I like dinner parties at other people’s houses. I do not give them. I think the world is divided between guest and host. I’m a guest. And I’m old, so I generally don’t get stuck at dinner parties I don’t like any more because I’m a very good judge of dinner parties before I go to them.Book clubs.I guess it’s nice people do it but, truthfully, I cannot think of a more solitary activity than reading – which is one of the reasons I love to read. I don’t have any animus against the idea but it certainly doesn’t appeal to me.Rocky Horror creator Richard O’Brien: ‘The Spice Girls couldn’t sing. But lovely girls’Read moreAirports.Airports are a horrible place invented by leaf blowers. Some are less horrible than others. But you can’t smoke in airports in this country. And airports, like most of life, depend on who’s there. If the person standing at TSA is a nightmarish prison guard, you’re going to have a horrible experience. I have had my hands swiped for explosives more times than anyone you could imagine. And you’re not allowed to say what you’re thinking, which is, “Do I look like the person who has a bomb in my luggage? Let’s be sensible here.”Labubus.I know what they are, unfortunately. There’s been many of these doll fads but these dolls are particularly unappealing-looking to me. What is different, now, is that adults do it. This used to be a thing kids did. But adults have these things connected to their bags and belts. Frankly, they look ridiculous.What is the weirdest thing you have done for love?Romance is not your central concern when you’re 75, let me assure you. People who say it is, they’re lying. So, I don’t know. I realise people think I’m unusual but I’m not weird. I’m not given to grand gestures either.It could be something weird by your own standards – like taking up an extreme sport.Oh, no, no, I would never do that. I was never so young that I ever said, “Oh, mountain climbing sounds fun.” No, it doesn’t sound fun to me. You want to go mountain climbing, have a nice time. I don’t understand why anyone does those things. Hiking is the most stupid thing I could ever imagine. I have watched people play tennis, because that was right at the very beginning of falling in love. Two weeks later? I’m not there any more.View image in fullscreenLebowitz at The Players club in Manhattan, New York.Photograph: Adrienne GrunwaldYou’re famous for always wearing jeans. A lot of people hate buying jeans. Can you tell us the art of selecting the perfect pair of jeans?They no longer make the perfect pair of jeans. If I had known they were going to stop making the perfect pair of Levi’s, I would have bought 100 pairs! They’re not peaches, they’re not going to rot. But I didn’t know. So if you want the perfect pair of jeans, you have to have them made now. Luckily, I have so many pairs of jeans that I’m still in the repairing stage. And I am old so I still think jeans are $25. Anything more than that is ridiculous.You have played a judge in both Law and Order and The Wolf of Wall Street. Is there a particular reason why?I have been asked numerous times to act in movies but I can’t act. It’s a talent and I don’t have it. People will say, “But you were in Law and Order and Wolf of Wall Street!” And I say, “Yes, I played a judge – because I am a judge.” All I do from morning to night is judge. In these instances, I got to actually have a gavel and a robe, which I don’t generally go around with – although I would like to. But I could not play any other role.Do you have a nemesis?Oh, I’m sure I have more than one. I’m sure I have them by the dozen. Luckily, I don’t really pay attention to other people in that way. I know I’m not America’s sweetheart. But even if I knew exactly the name of the person, I wouldn’t tell you.Is there anything that New York could stand to learn or adopt from Australia?I wish we had a building as great as the Sydney Opera House. That would be great. I don’t know where we’d put it but, if they let me, I would find a place.The laws that you have around food are great. There are many great restaurants that I’ve been to in Australia, but the quality of the actual food is fantastic. You don’t let any food in from other places. The most rigorous vetting I’ve ever had in an airport is coming into Australia. “Is that a seed you have on your shoe? Wait, is that a grape?” We could grow every kind of food here but we don’t any more. We get it from all over the place, so you can buy a watermelon in February. It’s horrible. So that’s something Australian I wish we would adopt. But the chances that this present administration would do that is definitely out of the question.What do you think is the most overrated book?I don’t believe I could confine myself to one. There are many overrated writers. I really want contemporary novels to be good but I find I don’t like the majority of them. Lots of times people say, “It’s generational, Fran, this writer is 20.” And my response to that is, “Well it is not good, because that shouldn’t matter.” Do I know how old Chekhov was when he wrote his stories? I don’t. Doesn’t matter. It’s just a great story.Most of my adult life I’ve been very irritated by the legend of F Scott Fitzgerald. So every five years, I reread The Great Gatsby, hoping it’s not that good – but unfortunately it is.What is the oldest thing you own, and why do you still have it?I have tons of old things in my apartment. Most of my furniture is from the 19th century. I have a lot of old books. I still have my childhood sled from when I was really little. I must have been, at the most, six years old. It has a rope tied to it so you could pull it up the hill – I remember watching my father tie that rope on. I also have my original childhood wagon. And like everything else in this apartment, there are books on them.Bill Bryson: ‘Ever since I was a little boy, I have pretended to be able to vaporise people I don’t like’Read moreWhat is the worst job you’ve ever done?Boy, I had a lot of bad jobs when I was young. New York City was full of bad jobs in the 70s. You could get a different bad job every week, and I did. I used to think, “I hate this job. I’m going to get a different bad job.” And then I would hate that job. Finally, I realised, and this is the truth – “Fran, you just don’t like to work”. I would have been a fantastic heiress.You were a New York taxi driver in the 70s, right?I was. That was a bad job. It wasn’t bad in terms of money – you got paid in cash and you’d go to these big garages to get a cab every eight hours, so you’d always have money. But it was a dangerous job – nothing ever happened to me, but that was just luck.What has been your most memorable interaction with a fan?I’m in the street a lot and I take the subway, more than most people who get recognised in the street. People say, “Don’t you hate it?” I don’t hate it. Because most of the people who want to talk to you like you. Though let me assure you, I get plenty of people who say worse things to my face. And people send terrible mail. Luckily, I’m not on the internet, so I don’t see the stuff about me on the internet, good or bad. I don’t care what other people think about me. If you don’t like me, don’t read my books and don’t watch my stuff!An Evening with Fran Lebowitz is touring Australia and New Zealand in May 2026;see here for datesExplore more on these topicsFran Lebowitz10 Chaotic QuestionsNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The evening’s official costume theme is “good, evil, iconic”, which is open to wide interpretation. Someone is dressed as the Lorax, another as a Christmas tree.View image in fullscreenNight falls over the beachFor the past week, about 15,000 school leavers have descended on theGold Coastto eat halal snack packs, drink copious amounts of sugary alcohol and sweat it out on the dancefloor.Among them is Brendan, 18, who extended his trip for an extra three nights because he’s been having such a great time since arriving from Brisbane.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThursday night’s theme was “party animal”, so he ended up with a novelty plush snake wrapped around his neck. “It was thrown around at the club last night and I just ended up with it,” he says. “It’s my emotional support snake.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPiper, 18, Brydie, 18, and Maddie, 17, on the Gold Coast for one night; a free haircut on Cavill AvenueTo Brendan, the highlight of the week has been the people. “You meet so many, just going up to randoms and saying hi,” he says. “Everyone’s the same age, and everyone’s just here to have a good time.”Surfers Paradise remains the largest destination for schoolies since the first party began at Broadbeach in the 1970s.That’s despite the rising attraction of overseas destinations including Fiji and Bali, and thesteady popularityof smaller beachside towns such as Byron Bay and Lorne.View image in fullscreenA packed pool at the Hilton hotel on the final day of schoolies weekThings have changed, though, since the 70s.The acting district director of theQueenslandambulance service, Justin Payne, says that although 479 patients were treated throughout the week, only 18 required hospitalisation, mostly for intoxication or minor injuries picked up after falling while dancing on the beach.“A decade ago we’d have to transport around 40 people a night to the hospital system,” he says. “Seeing only 18 in a week for minor things is extremely positive.”There were 20 arrests, acting chief superintendent Brett Jackson says, including for the possession of drugs and disorderly conduct. That figure is also down on previous years, attributed to a“changing culture”of “kids looking after each other” and image transformation.View image in fullscreenCharlie and Hugh sunbathe beside the Hilton poolIn 2003 the Queensland government established a formal schoolies hub, not to encourage teenagers to the Gold Coast but to manage the safety response.For two weeks, roads in central Surfers Paradise are closed and traffic is diverted to accommodate the hub, which operates from 7pm until midnight every evening.It feels a bit like the party version of an open-air prison. The teenagers, all wearing identical fluorescent pink lanyards, are herded behind fencing that blocks off tourists, locals and older “toolies” from the festivities.Behind the fencing is the beach, a large makeshift stage and a series of tents offering water, emergency assistance and welfare checks, including guided walks home. “Be safe and watch your mates,” posters lining the site’s boundaries read.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFriends dress in animal theme for the ‘party animal’ dance party; schoolies out and aboutThis is a no-booze and no-drug zone but you wouldn’t know it from the carnival-like atmosphere. Judging by the number of slabs of beer under arms as night descends, they’ve had their fill before entering.In the early afternoon, though, the streets are alarmingly quiet. Most schoolies sleep until midday. About 2pm, sunburnt teenagers emerge to sit in the sweltering heat at an array of takeaway shops where they tuck in to kebab-shop deals – specific to schoolies – and plates of fried chicken.Some frolic in the sea. A group of boys pass a friend from the night before and croak out “he’s alive” with a confident fist bump.Mia, 17, who is staying at the Hilton, describes the daily routine as “low-key chill”.View image in fullscreenSchool leavers dance on the beach“Basically, you wake up, go to the pool or just chill and watch TV, low-key just lying around. Then pre [drinks], room hopping, doing what you want to do.”The Hilton is one of the biggest accommodation sites, and the only one to offer its own exclusive “pool party” events. Parties in the upper-level penthouses, which cost $1,500 for the week during schoolies, are said to be the most coveted invites.During the day, dozens of school leavers stretch out on cabanas like lizards and mill about in the pool, drinking Hard Rated through plastic straws.Joey, 18, dunks his friends in the water to cries of glee. He’s among a big group of friends who journeyed from Brisbane a week ago and are about to celebrate their last night. Asked what their plans are, he simply replies: “We’re having a big one.”As night descends, things begin to turn a little weird.Someone with a T-shirt reading “I love MILFS” stumbles along the sidewalk with their friends, one of whom is in a banana suit. McDonald’s is the centre of festivities. Outside, a local teen, Kane, 18, is offering free haircuts to school leavers.View image in fullscreenInside a shared roomWill, 18, from Brisbane, is getting a checkered skullet (a mullet with checks shaved into the sides) engraved on his head. “I made a bet with my friends three years ago that if I got a checkered skullet they all had to get it,” he says by way of explanation. “Hopefully the ladies love it.”Down the road, a number of religious groups try to convert the youth, some preaching about Jesus, others warning of the rapture. Hare Krishnas are in attendance, and attract a large contingent due to their live music and upbeat demeanour.A group of boys in novelty sombreros jump in on the action and begin dancing and singing alongside them. “Hare Krishna,” they call, leaping into the air and pumping their fists.View image in fullscreenA packed Cavill Avenue – the main hub for schoolies celebrationsPiper, 18, and Maddie, 17, are among them, after just arriving from Brisbane. They’re “broke as”, so they’re here for one night only and will return to work for a 5pm shift on Saturday.Asked what their plans are for the evening, they cheer: “Clubs!”“We have nowhere to stay, maybe we’ll sleep on the beach,” Piper says happily.When plunged into the hedonistic Gold Coast, it’s easy to forget data suggestingfewer young Australiansare drinking alcohol.Shopfronts roll out neon signs promising schoolies specials, selling everything from singlets emblazoned with “Eat, sleep, schoolies repeat” to bucket hats encouraging viewers to “Be a flirt, lift your shirt”. Another simply reads: “Warning: horny AF.”Condom Kingdom, an adult entertainment store in the centre of town, capitalises heavily on the tourist trade, offering schoolies “survival kit” showbags filled with g-strings, condoms and lubricant.Out the front of its store, staff on microphones call out for teens to try their Spin to Win wheel, with prizes ranging from handcuffs to “boobie water bottles”. One teenage boy saunters up, takes a spin and comes away with a cock ring.The viral sex workers Annie Knight and Lily Phillips are also here, under the guise of promoting safe sex after Knight and a fellow content creator, Bonnie Blue, were kicked out last year for trying to film content with “barely legal” adults.The duo pop up at a string of schoolies-affiliated venues and clubs, taking selfies with eager teenage boys and happily waving fluorescent glow sticks on the dancefloor.Is this pornification of schoolies a promotion of consent and sex positivity? Or is it glorifying and exploitative, turning sexual experiences into conquests that grant boasting rights to your mates?The Queensland government’s safe sex messaging is everywhere. The hub’s main stage flashes with a billboard reading: “Everyone has the right to feel safe. Groping without consent is assault.”Mia, 18, says her group isn’t here for hookups. “We just want to be with our friends,” she says. “We’re for the girls.”View image in fullscreenA group of schoolies from Melbourne enjoying some dinner on the beach at Surfers ParadiseOn Friday night she’s in her hotel room getting ready to go out with her mates, Mila, Charlie and Shaelynn, all from Brisbane. Empty instant noodle packets and vodka cruiser bottles litter the floor.They got home at 5.30am that morning and plan to do it again tonight. “When I look back on this, I’ll have Fomo [of future years],” Mila says. “I already want to come back.”View image in fullscreenSeven clubs across Surfers Paradise are officially affiliated with schoolies, attracting about 1,500 people through the doors each night.The lines snake around the street when they open at 10pm. But until then hundreds of schoolies descend on the beach hub, where I Like to Move It has transitioned to AC/DC’s Thunderstruck.Groups of volunteers who have worked around the clock for the past week take the stage to large cheers. The SES team is among them, in full uniform. Before returning to work they start a small dancefloor on the sand to an electronic version of the tune Life Is a Highway.Together, the SES and school leavers wave their arms in the air, ecstatic under flashing lights, vastly different in age yet bonding over the shared sentiment of the song and the power of music. Life is a highway, and they’re going to ride it. All night long.Explore more on these topicsGold CoastQueenslandAustralian educationYoung peopleAlcoholShareReuse this content"

Sirin and Lucy identified 48 cases of serious harm (including late-term stillbirths and neonatal deaths) involving mothers or birth attendants who appear to be linked to FBS, which experts say gives women “dangerous” misinformation. (Since we published, the FBS which says its content is for “educational and informational” purposes, rather than medical advice,dismissed the criticismas inaccurate “propaganda”.) Keep an ear out for The Birth Keepers podcast, too, coming soon on theGuardian Investigates feed.Read more2.‘I almost always play it in hiding, alone’: can anyone get into free jazz, history’s most maligned music?View image in fullscreenPharoah Sanders and Sonny Sharrock, Berlin, 1968.Photograph: Philippe Gras, courtesy of Suong GrasEven though he’s partial to hideous noise, free jazz – “arguably the most challenging and far-out music one can listen to” – is mostly unknown to the Guardian’s pop critic Alexis Petridis. Could a new guidebook from Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore change his mind? (Very much so, it turned out.)Read more3.‘It crushed my confidence. I’ve never got over it’: Karen Carney on online abuse – and how Strictly is rebuilding herView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Lee MaloneShe’s the emerging star of this year’s dance show, wowing judges with her pasodoble. In this revealing interview, the pundit and former footballer spoke to Emine Saner about gentleness, bullying, her love of the Lionesses and why she’s never been so happy.Read more4.The death of the living room: ‘It’s hard to invite people over – not everyone wants to sit on a bed’View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Harold M Lambert/Getty ImagesLiving rooms have long been commonplace within western homes and something many of us take for granted, but according to recent research, a growing number of UK rentals come without living room access. Almost half (49%) of all renters surveyed reported that the living room in their home is now being used as a bedroom. With people having to eat and socialise in kitchens, bedrooms and stairwells, is it possible, asked Leah Harper, to relax and build community without a communal area?Read more5.Murder Inc: how my failed attempt to make a Zodiac Killer film took me to the dark heart of the true crime industryView image in fullscreenIllustration: Joan Wong/The Guardian“If you think true crime is inescapable when you’re browsing Netflix or making small talk with your co-workers,” wrote Charlie Shackleton, “try working in the documentary industry. As you traipse from one commissioning meeting to the next, pitching your passion project on the history of mime or the secret life of snails, you can almost hear the words before they’re spoken: ‘Got any other ideas?’ Preferably something with a body count.” When his quest to make a cliche-free film about one of the US’s most notorious cold cases fell apart, Charlie ended up investigating something entirely different – our own morbid curiosity.Read more6.The long and winding road: why our opinions about the Beatles keep changingView image in fullscreenRingo, Paul, George and John.Photograph: PRFans and historians have spent 60 years debating what the band means – and which member is greatest. Will the returning Anthology project and Sam Mendes’s planned biopics create new arguments? Stuart Maconie’ mapped out the four distinct eras of critical understanding of the band and asked if these recent projects may “encourage us to see the Beatles not as fixed historical figures but as subjects whose meaning continues to evolve with each retelling”.Read moreExplore more on these topicsSix great readsnewsShareReuse this content"

In short order, Thomas Frank is running through the gamut of his predecessors, from hope to disappointment to what now resembles hopelessness.Demolition by Arsenalhad already created a sticky wicket. Adecent midweek showing in Paris, though another defeat, had barely increased the credit rating. Losing to Fulham, a team with a previous away record as miserable as Spurs’ home form, intensified the pressure. That Frank was appointed by the departed stewardship of Daniel Levy is to be noted; fresh ownership regimes tend to be trigger-happy with inherited managers.‘Not true Tottenham fans’: boos for goalkeeper Vicario anger Thomas FrankRead moreShould such a decision be made, and it still seems a premature outcome considering Frank made slow starts at his previous clubs, Marco Silva, linked previously on a couple of occasions, would be a live contender. By six minutes in, Silva was cavorting on the sidelines with his Fulham staff. His team were 2-0 up and the home fans were baying for blood. By the final whistle, theTottenham HotspurStadium emptied, the mood was even lower, Frank’s outlook even bleaker.The damage was done early on. Following neat skills from Samuel Chukwueze, Pedro Porro and Archie Gray tied in knots, Kenny Tete was given space and grace to score, via a deflection off Destiny Udogie. Two minutes later Guglielmo Vicario’s mis-kick from way outside his own area, the Italian heading out on a wholly unscheduled safari, had been diverted to Harry Wilson by Josh King. Wilson guided his lob beautifully, the keeper stranded. “I saw the keeper was in a sticky situation,” said Wilson.“That gave us the confidence and the boost we needed,” said Silva, celebrating Fulham’s first win at Tottenham since Martin Jol pulled off a revenger’s win in 2013. “I am not here to analyse them, it’s not for me. Football is about risk and we took it.”Vicario’s next attempts to clear his lines were jeered. “They can’t be true Tottenham fansbecause everyone supports each other when you’re on the pitch,” said Frank, veering into the territory of lighting the blue touch paper.Fulham’s previous haul from six away games had been the single point collected on the opening day at Brighton. For Tottenham, their attacking style was kryptonite, rather like most visiting teams’. Spurs’ last home victory came that same opening weekend; only Manchester United, Southampton and Burnley have lost there in thePremier Leaguein 2025.As Frank raged impotently on the sidelines, Chukwueze, making an impressive first league start, hit a post; where Tottenham were disastrous, Fulham were devastating. “Chukwu-magic – that’s his nickname in the training field,” said Alex Iwobi of his fellow Nigerian.View image in fullscreenRicharlison, Pedro Porro, Randal Kolo Muani and Guglielmo Vicario show their disappointment at half-time.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersThe Parisian promise of a partnership between Richarlison and Randal Kolo Muani was far less encouraging in London. Silva had been watching on Wednesday. “I think we controlled that situation well,” he said. Spurs players departed at half-time with boos rattling the rafters and returned to a half-empty stadium, fans paying high prices favouring warmth over misery. Those of an xG persuasion would have noted a flatlining score of 0.07 for the first half.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fulham, perhaps mindful of their previous travel sickness, began to retreat and Mohammed Kudus’s goal, smashed with his right foot, Bernd Leno’s response unconvincing, set up 30 minutes for Spurs to save the match, and possibly Frank’s job.On came Wilson Odobert, Xavi Simons and Rodrigo Bentancur, and chances at last piled up, Raúl Jiménez clearing off the line from Lucas Bergvall’s flicked header. Fulham, meanwhile, ran down the clock to take the sting from opposition whose renewed strength of purpose was curbed by a lack of coherency.Nobody could find sufficient inspiration for a revival mission that eventually flagged in tandem with the spirits of Tottenham fans. “We are in a tough spell right now and for my players it is about being as calm as possible and doing everything we can to work through it,” said Frank. The inspirational figure he cut at Brentford has found little constituency at Tottenham.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Heavy England wins have been few and far between in recent years. A7-0 defeat of a heavily depletedand underfunded Jamaica in their final warm-up game before the Euros was the biggest since a 10-0 defeat of Luxembourg in 2022.Against China at a moon-topped Wembley, the margin was eight, a Georgia Stanway hat-trick and Beth Mead double was added to by goals from Lauren Hemp, Ella Toone and Alessia Russo to complete the rout.England 8-0 China: women’s friendly football international – live reactionRead moreThere was some nostalgia in the comprehensiveness of this victory. When Sarina Wiegman’s tenure began in 2021 there was no Nations League and World Cup and Euros qualifying looked a little different. England went unbeaten under Wiegman all the way to theirfirst European Championship titlein 2022, sweeping teams aside by large margins.Those games were a mixture of friendlies and straightforward World Cup qualifiers against teams such as North Macedonia, Luxembourg and Latvia.Since then, the impression has been that England have failed to regain that all-conquering form of Wiegman’s early tenure, but that would be a naive and unfair assumption to make. The reality is that work has been done by Fifa and Uefa to improve the competitiveness of qualifiers and improve the challenge for teams up and down the rankings list.View image in fullscreenAlessia Russo scores England’s eighth goal at Wembley.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe 8-0 win on Saturday evening harked back to a simpler time, a time where physical, technical and tactical competitive tests were rare in between major tournaments and, while it was a lot of fun at a sold-out Wembley, it was not something we should long for month-in month-out.The crowd was a little patchy in the upper tier for a sold-out event at the national stadium, but there is always a drop off for England women games, 74,611 the actual attendance. The fact that the FA was able to sell out the stadium for a friendly visit of the team ranked 16th in the world was, in reality, hugely impressive when previous sell-outs had come against top-10 teams.They were treated to a show. Despite the many absences through injury or to manage return from injury or workloads – Leah Williamson, Hannah Hampton, Lauren James, Khiara Keating, Alex Greenwood, Michelle Agyemang and Jess Carter all out – there was a familiarity to the starting XI.Anna Moorhouse was handed a first start in place of injured Keating and Hampton, and Maya Le Tissier partnered Esme Morgan with centre-back options reduced, but the rest of the starting lineup was surprisingly strong.View image in fullscreenGeorgia Stanway (left) and captain Keira Walsh embrace after England’s fourth goal.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I think that went really well,” Wiegman said of her centre-back duo. “[They] played together in the last camp too. They can show where they are at as individuals and also how they connect together. I think it worked well.”That England were five goals up by the break was no surprise as a result. The work rate of Mead and Hemp on the wings was critical to stretching China’s back line and Lucy Bronze’s flick on for the former opened the goal rush 12 minutes in. The Arsenal forward brought the ball down with one touch before she fired past Pan Hongyan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stanway joined the party a lengthy seven minutes later, when Hemp’s effort was punched away by Pan but turned in by the Bayern Munich midfielder on the half-volley. Her second came before the break, the ball came back off Li Mengwen’s high hand and the referee Alina Pesu pointed to the spot which Stanway duly converted from. Stanway secured her hat-trick after a neat one-two with Ella Toone after half-time.Then Toone turned in, firing in Pan’s errant pass after the keeper came under pressure from Russo, and Russo finally got on the scoresheet herself to add England’s eighth.“What I wanted was to come here, show who we are and put a good performance in,” said Wiegman. “I hope everyone enjoyed that. We did. We wanted to be better in the final third and today we did that and that made China look worse too because we scored easier.”There was little to glean from this fixture in terms of where England are in their development, their strength in depth and ability to untangle the low block the highlights of an entertaining and inconsequential evening.Explore more on these topicsFriendliesEngland women's football teamChina PR women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

They are back up to second, four points behind the Gunners, who travel to Chelsea on Sunday. This was Leeds’s fourth straight league reverse but the fight shown augurs well for Daniel Farke’s job security.City had spurned a two-goal interval advantage after Dominic Calvert-Lewin, a half-time substitute, terrorised the hosts. The 28-year-old scored in the 49th minute, then claimed the penalty that led to Lukas Nmecha’s 68th-minute equaliser, rattling Josko Gvardiol enough for him to scythe the striker down.Everton v Newcastle: Premier League – liveRead moreCity’s response was admirable. The substitute Rayan Cherki fed Foden who ran left across Leeds’s area before beating Lucas Perri. Yet Leeds’s second-half display again illuminated City’s defensive frailties – they are too easily raided along the flanks, in particular.Guardiola said: “We are not a team to win these types of games a lot. When we knew it was 10 minutes extra time we said: ‘Let’s go.’ We had two or three chances to score, we were able to close and it was massively important for our mood. Tomorrow we see Arsenal and Chelsea, but it’s important to be as close as possible to the top.”After 59 seconds, a diagram of City at their best was offered. Nico González swivelled and tapped the ball to Gvardiol, whose 45-yard diagonal hit Matheus Nunes. The right-back leaped to control, relayed the ball infield to Bernardo Silva, darted forward, received possession again and found Foden, whose finish pinballed off the bar.View image in fullscreenLukas Nmecha’s penalty was saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma but he could smile after equalising from the follow-up.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersAn apt riposte toTuesday’s 2-0 loss to Bayer Leverkusen, as Foden and Nunes were two of the 10 changes that backfired on Guardiola.City were rampant and a second goal soon lit up the scoreboard. When Foden’s corner from the right came back to him he rammed the ball at goal and a flying Perri palmed away for a corner on the other side. This came in from Tijjani Reijnders, Nico O’Reilly beat a flailing Perri to head down and Gvardiol finished. The video assistant referee’s check for offside proved negative and City cruised.The charge regarding Farke is that he is out of his depth at this level. His team were being cast the same, so a rare foray that featured Wilfried Gnonto passing to Nmecha had to be converted instead of being blasted over.At the interval, Farke hooked Gnonto and Daniel James for Calvert-Lewin and Jaka Bijol, switching to 3-5-2, and there was an instant dividend. Nunes, twice, was City’s culprit. First, a loose pass ceded possession. Then, when Calvert-Lewin got the better of a covering Gvardiol, Nunes could have hacked clear. But the auxiliary defender dawdled and Calvert-Lewin poked home.Gianluigi Donnarumma was jeered by the travelling support for requiring attention – perhaps as this allowed Guardiola to have a pitchside pow-wow. Farke, too, was dubious. “It’s in the rules, it’s smart,” he said. “If I like it, if it is fair play, I keep it to myself and leave it to the authorities to find solutions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t criticise Pep for this – he did not go down.”Guardiola said: “I didn’t speak with Gigio. When it happened I looked back to the dugout and said: ‘James [Trafford], warm up’. I don’t know. Next press conference you can ask me and I will ask Gigio.”View image in fullscreenPhil Foden shows his delight after putting Manchester City ahead after one minute.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersThe chat did zero good, because after Jayden Bogle’s header into City’s area a hapless Gvardiol was spooked by Calvert-Lewin, who was upended. This was the clearest penalty Peter Bankes will give yet still Rúben Dias moaned to the referee in comical manner. Up stepped Nmecha, whose initial effort was saved by Donnarumma before the forward rolled the rebound in.Guardiola’s order to up the tempo resulted in goalmouth scrambles involving Bernardo Silva, O’Reilly and the anonymous Erling Haaland but Leeds escaped. Sadly for them, they could not avert City’s box-office finale but on this evidence Farke is still being heeded by his players. “My players should take pride,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Australian responded well in Qatar and delivered an impressive run to take the top spot with his final lap, one that had to be inch-perfect after Norris had laid down a strong marker in a tightly fought qualifying contest.It was as good a day behind the wheel as Piastri has enjoyed since he last won, at the Dutch GP in August, which was also the last time he claimed pole. Piastri won the sprint race with a dominant drive and with Norris only third it was a vital boost to the Australian’s title ambitions, while Verstappen took fourth place dropping a point to the championship leading Briton.“Let’s go, baby!” Piastri declared over the radio after winning the sprint.With victory in the 19-lap dash, Piastri narrowed the gap to Norris by two points to 22, while Verstappen fell one point further behind, to 25 in arrears.Norris still holds the cards and can seal the championship on Sunday. He must be 26 points ahead of Piastri and Verstappen. If either of his rivals are closer than that margin then the title will be decided in Abu Dhabi. A win in the race would be enough for Norris regardless of any other results and he will also take the title if he outscores Piastri by four points and finishes ahead of Verstappen in any position.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri on his way to pole in Qatar.Photograph: David Davies/PAPiastri’s pole could be vital in taking the title to Abu Dhabi. The high-speed Lusail circuit, with its sequences of fast corners, is notoriously hard for overtaking, as was demonstrated in the sprint race. Drivers finding it hard to close or to enjoy a sufficient speed advantage to make a pass through corners that are taken flat-out.If Piastri can keep his nose in front after the long drag to the first corner, in what will be a mandated two-stop race making strategies likely to converge, he will have every shot at controlling the race to the flag and taking the title to the wire.He knows he is fighting to stay in the game but finally was able to enjoy his performance after what has been a late-season slump. “Winning is a lot more fun than whatever the hell happened the last four or five races, that’s for sure,” he said. “You always try and enjoy it. When you look at the bigger picture, even in the last few weeks that have been tough I’m still driving probably the fastest car or one of the fastest cars there’s ever been in the world and I love all of that.”Norris had looked on course to deny his teammate when, at the sharp end in Q3, he opened the running with a roaring lap, his best of the day, with a time of 1min 19.495sec. Piastri pushed hard but could not quite match it at just three-hundredths down.Norris had the advantage entering the final laps and once more led the way but he went slightly wide at turn two, a small error but enough to make him abort his lap and it was costly.View image in fullscreenLando Norris will start Sunday’s grand prix from second on the grid.Photograph: Florent Gooden/DPPI/Shutterstock“I just caught a bit of an understeer for some reason,” he said. “That was it. So I’m a bit frustrated because I certainly think I could have done a better job.”Piastri followed, was quicker in the two opening sectors, and grabbed the top spot. The serious business is yet to come but he could do no more than finishing on top both times when push came to shove and ensuring Norris will have no easy ride to his first F1 title.After the sprint race Norris also hit back at Verstappen’s comments, made earlier in the weekend, when the Dutchman stated he wouldalready have won the world championshipif he had been driving a McLaren.“He generally has a good clue about a lot of things, but there is also a lot of things he doesn’t have much of a clue about,” Norris said. “But it is also Red Bull’s way of going about things, an aggressive nature and just talking nonsense a lot of the time.“It depends if you want to listen to it and talk about it like he would love you to do, or do what we do as a team which is keeping our heads down and stay focused. Maybe he would have done [won the title easily] but he hasn’t done so far.”Lewis Hamilton’s trying weekend in a poorly performing Ferrari continued as he went out in Q1 in 18th place, having managed only 17th in the sprint race.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Oscar PiastriLando NorrisMax VerstappenMcLarenRed BullFormula OnenewsShareReuse this content"

The first Test finished asan eight-wicket thumping, done inside 48 hours and worthy of criticism, but it was not without a genuine wobble from the hosts en route.Either way, Ben Stokes looked to do so when his players resumed training at Allan Border Field on Saturday morning before next week’s day-night second Test at the Gabba. Gone wasthe “shell-shocked” captainseen during the immediate aftermath of going 1-0 down and in his place, having reflected during the past few days, a far more conciliatory figure.Mark Wood Ashes blow as England pace bowler ruled out of Gabba TestRead morePerformances can only truly change perceptions of this England side, but there was an acceptance from Stokes that some of the blowback has been valid. He also rowed back on calling former players such as Ian Botham, Michael Vaughan and Graham Gooch“has-beens” before the series, the trio among those to question whether their preparation were thorough enough.“I got the words I said there completely wrong,” said a sheepish Stokes. “Has-beens is a horrible word. It’s the only thing that managed to come out of my mouth at that moment. God, I’m going to be one of those one day. But it’s not at all what I meant by that.”Talk of lessons being learned is a common refrain from defeated sides but Stokes – preferring one-on-one debriefs rather than all in one room – was happy to expand on a few. Among them was his own leadership in the field, admitting that his bowling plans during Travis Head’s whirlwind assault on the target of 205 runs slightly cracked under pressure.View image in fullscreenJofra Archer looks dejected during the first Test. ‘The key thing for me is to be completely crystal clear with my bowlers,’ said Ben Stokes.Photograph: Asanka Brendon Ratnayake/Reuters“I could have been a lot better as captain,” he said. “I am the person who makes decisions about how we go out there and operate and I am the one who gives the plans to the bowlers. I wasn’t as clear as I normally am. The key thing for me is to be completely crystal clear with my bowlers.”A concern here is that Stokes and the head coach, Brendon McCullum, remain convinced that the target set was plenty, when the brief history of Tests at Perth Stadium shows that batting conditions improve after tea on day two. England’s collapse after lunch – the loss of four for 11 when effectively 105 for one – was where the contest was lost.This is a slightly brittle England batting lineup. Devastating on their day, no question, but one that has been bowled out inside 40 overs an alarming seven times since the start of last year. Three of these occurred in India and Pakistan – an achilles heel against spin not exactly exclusive to the current generation – but Stokes conceded the statistic told a story overall.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We know we are very, very good at the first bit and there are areas that we can be better doing the second bit.“We do understand that. We don’t shrug it off and think: ‘Next time hopefully it will happen.’ When we say: ‘We’re going to stick to what we’re doing,’ it doesn’t mean we don’t think about all of this kind of stuff.”There was also a nod to the England supporters – the thousands who have flown to Australia and those watching through the night at home – with Stokes acknowledging the frustration they have felt. “We know we’ve got an incredible fanbase who come out here and support us,” he said. “They want to see us win. We want to win. We’re absolutely desperate. They’re absolutely desperate. We’re all on the same wavelength.”Not every charge was met with a guilty plea, however. Plenty has been said about England’s attitude, with MitchellJohnson among those to call England arrogantin the past week. The pair met on the field during the 2013-14 Ashes, a fiery encounter when Stokes first showed his appetite for the fight. Twelve years on, the all-rounderwas again pushing back.“I think arrogant might be a little bit too far, but that’s OK,” said Stokes. “We take the rough with the smooth. Call us whatever you want. I’d rather words like ‘rubbish’, but ‘arrogant’ … I’m not so sure about that. We didn’t have the Test match that we wanted to, but we were great in passages of that game.”We didn’t have the Test match that we wanted to but we were great in passages of that gameThose passages chiefly refer to afearsome first-innings outing with the ballthat saw Australia shot down for 132 all out; encouragement looking ahead, even ifMark Wood will missthe second instalment. Australia’s players are far too savvy to be writing off the tourists just yet.That said, the hosts have a distinct advantage given their far greater experience of day-night Test cricket and a record that reads 14 played, 13 won. To that end, Stokes understood why England’s decision toshoulder arms to the tour matchin Canberra this weekend, save for sending three unused players, looks strange from the outside.But the sticky humidity of Brisbane anda Gabba surface likely to bouncefar more than Manuka Oval support the thinking. As was the case in Perth – a fast-forward match that swung more wildly than has been acknowledged in some quarters – that call will be framed by the result.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Ben StokesEngland cricket teamThe AshesAustralia cricket teamCricketAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Worse, was it pointless? Well, it certainly had more points to it than Wales would have liked. But, worse again, was it actively alienating? A record defeat, 11 tries conceded, the first time since 1967 Wales have failed to score a point in Cardiff. The opposition on that day 58 years ago, Ireland, scored 70 fewer than the Springboks here.“It’s quite a raw, emotional dressing room,” said Dewi Lake, Wales’s captain. “The boys are proud Welshmen, so coming off the field with the scoreboard looking like that is tough to take. But I don’t think it’s going to ruin the confidence of the younger boys. If anything, it drives you even more. You recognise the gap and what you’ve got to do.”Wales v South Africa: Autumn Nations Series rugby union – liveRead moreSouth Africa continue to demonstrate their superiority over every other nation. People are starting to compare them to the best sides we have ever seen. And they remain as brutal as ever, mostly legitimately, sometimes less so. They received their third red card of the autumn, their third to a second-row, but there was no arguing with this one. Eben Etzebeth, a full head taller than any of his opponents in the middle of a fracas two minutes from time, jabbed his thumb into the eye of Alex Mann.

The Welsh regions were stretched as well, shipping in players on loan to fulfil their fixtures in the United Rugby Championship.But the harsh truth is, the Welsh Rugby Union is also down to its bare bones. People like to tut and roll their eyeballs when the making of money is seen as prioritised over player welfare, but there is a difference between “making money” and not haemorrhaging it. The extra revenue from this fixture, no matter the stadium was two-thirds full, is precious indeed as the WRU faces up to the realities of the professional era, approaching the end of its third decade.Quick GuideWales 0-73 South Africa teams and scorersShowWalesMurray (B Thomas 66); Mee, Roberts, Hawkins, Dyer; Edwards (Sheedy 50), Hardy (Morgan-Williams 50); G Thomas (Southworth 50), Lake (capt; Coghlan 78), Assiratti (Coleman 44; Assiratti 62), Carter, Davies (Ratti 61), Plumtree, Mann, Wainwright (Morse 43)Yellow cardsPlumtree 43, Wainwright 54South AfricaWillemse; Hooker, De Allende, Esterhuizen, Moodie; Feinberg-Mngomezulu, Van Den Berg (Reinach 51); Steenkamp (Porthen 51), Grobbelaar (Mbonambi 51), Louw (Ntlabakanye 51), Kleyn (Etzebeth 51), Nortjé, Kolisi (capt; Smith 51), Mostert (Van Standen 51), Wiese (Dixon 51)Red cardEtzebeth 79TriesSteenkamp, Hooker, Wiese, Van den Berg, Louw, Feinberg-Mngomezulu 2, Moodie, Esterhuizen, Nortjé, EtzebethConsFeinberg-Mngomezulu 9RefereeLuc Ramos (France)Att50,112Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The bookies gave Wales a 40-point head start. South Africa had covered that only five minutes into the second half, when Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu, continuing to play on another plane from most people in rugby, certainly anyone in Wales, scored the first of his two tries. He converted that, just as he had the previous six tries.

Imagine if they had actually played at their best. They had four in the first half, all based around an utterly dominant scrum. Ethan Hooker’s try, South Africa’s second, straight from that set piece was nicely worked. The others were a story of brutal physicality.Wales had one lineout in the Springbok 22 in the first half. They overthrew it. They had another – and their first piece of possession in the opposition “red zone” as people like to call it these days – in the 58th minute. They worked a few phases, then Kwagga Smith was over the ball to win the penalty. End of that little interlude.Smith was on because South Africa brought on all eight replacements 10 minutes into the second half, which meant seven forwards, the whole pack replaced bar Ruan Nortjé, who weighed in with a try himself 10 minutes from time. Etzebeth led the phalanx of replacements. For a side to be 49-0 down and face the introduction of players of that calibre is almost too much, whether an international window is shut or not.Etzebeth battered his way over from close range for a try with five minutes to go, the 11th and final of the rout. And then, that grin never far from his face, he took his menace too far. Rarely can an act of barbarity have seemed so pointless. Never has a match here in this famous stadium been so full of points for the opposition.Explore more on these topicsAutumn Nations SeriesWales rugby union teamSouth Africa rugby teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Saints lost Edoardo Todaro to a first-minute red card and it was downhill all the way after that as Bristol ran in six tries.Scrum-half Kieran Marmion scored two and Tom Jordan, Kalaveti Ravouvou, Aidan Boshoff and Luka Ivanishvili also crossed, with Sam Worsley kicking five conversions and two penalties. JJ van der Mescht and Tom Litchfield scored Northampton’s tries, one of which Fin Smith converted.Etzebeth red mars South Africa romp as Wales slump to record home defeatRead more“I’m really proud of the boys as we fought for everything, with the first half being brilliant,” said theBristolhead coach, Pat Lam. “As a result we got the outcome we wanted, five points against the top-of-the-table side and them leaving with nothing.”Welsh wing Louis Rees-Zammit came on as an early replacement for the injured Jack Bates. He said: “I’m really enjoying it back in the Premiership and, after some disappointing results last season, we wanted to make Ashton Gate a fortress again. After today it’s three from three here. We wanted to use the air more today and we won the aerial battle with our forwards being magnificent.”Saints director of rugby, Phil Dowson, was at a loss to explain his side’s performance. “It was ugly again at Ashton Gate and we’ll need to lick our wounds after that,” he said. “We seemed very flat and tepid and you’ll get found out against a side like Bristol, who come hard at you.”Saints made a disastrous start by losing Todaro, newly capped by Italy, to an immediate red card. Todaro’s dangerous challenge on Worsley while he was in the air left the referee with little alternative and Bristol soon capitalised when Marmion quickly took a tap penalty to dart over.Bristol soon scored another when Jordan ran a clever angle to collect a pass from James Williams for an easy run-in before they produced the try of the game by bemusing the opposition with some splendid inter-passing. It culminated in Harry Thacker bursting down the right touchline and, when the hooker was brought down, Marmion was on hand to pick up and score his second.View image in fullscreenAidan Boshoff screams with delight after scoring a try for Bristol.Photograph: Paul Rubery/Focus Images Ltd./ShutterstockBears suffered a blow when Bates left the field with an injury to be replaced by Rees-Zammit but it did not slow the hosts’ momentum as a thumping tackle by Benhard Janse van Rensburg on Smith enabled Ravouvou to seize possession before running 45 metres to score.Northampton’s miserable first half was complete when they conceded a fifth try from replacement Boshoff, who collected a well-timed pass from Worsley to leave Bristol with a 35-0 interval lead.Six minutes after the restart, Saints at last struck a blow when giant lock Van der Mescht forced his way over to reward their first period of pressure, but Worsley soon extended the home side’s lead with a straightforward penalty.Saints, a more competitive side in the second half, scored a second from Litchfield after the centre won the race to collect a well-judged kick from George Furbank. Worsley added a second penalty for a match tally of 16 points before Ivanishvili finished off a driving lineout to emphasise Bristol’s superiority.George Skivington hailed the centre Seb Atkinson’s impact on his return from injury inGloucester’s26-15 victory overHarlequins.Atkinson, who excelled on England’s summer tour to Argentina, was ruled out of the Autumn Nations Series after suffering a knee and hip injury during the Prem defeat at Bath in mid-October. But he looked as though he had never been away asGloucesterclaimed their first Prem win of the season at the sixth attempt.View image in fullscreenBen Redshaw scored twice in Gloucester’s victory.Photograph: Warren Little/Getty Images“Having Seb back and his energy back was great. He is a guy you want to build things around,” Gloucester’s head coach Skivington said. “He is a tough lad and he deals with things pretty well. He controls what he can control. Seb is a massive part of it here. He is a leader and him being on the field is crucial for us.”The full-back Ben Redshaw also shone, scoring two tries as Gloucester triumphed for the first time in league action since May. The flanker Lewis Ludlow and wing Ollie Thorley added further touchdowns for Skivington’s team, securing a bonus-point success complemented by the fly-half Ross Byrne kicking three conversions.Quins had scored the first try through Cadan Murley and led 12-7 after Alex Dombrandt’s score, converted by Marcus Smith. A Smith penalty was Quins’ only score after half-time.On Friday,Exetercame from 26-6 down to secure a dramatic 27-26 win and inflict a rare home defeat onSale. Tries from Jack Yeandle, Olly Woodburn and Scott Sio, all converted by Henry Slade, gave the Chiefs victory.Leicesterextended Newcastle’s losing start to the Prem season with a 39-17 victory in a clinical five-try performance.

While her odds were trimmed slightly for next year’s festival, the 16-1 still on offer for a successful defence of her crown is a fair reflection of her place in the pecking order over hurdles. She will never be rated within 20lb of Constitution Hill at his peak, but that Constitution Hill seems to be gone for good, replaced by an impostor whose confidence at the hurdles is shot to bits.There was a jovial cheer from a big and boisterous Newcastle crowd as Constitution Hill cleared the first hurdle . He had been sent off as favourite for the 13th time in 14 starts, despite falls at Cheltenham and Aintree in the spring and a dismal runin the Boodles Champion Hurdle at Punchestownin early May, when he looked as though he wanted to be anywhere but on a racecourse.But there was only a deep, collective groan of despair as Constitution Hill guessed and guessed again at the second flight, seemingly unsure of even the jumping basics. The result was inevitable and leftNicky Henderson, his trainer, who was watching on from Newbury, in despair at his stable star’s precipitous decline.“First and foremost he’s fine, which is all that matters,” Henderson told ITV Racing. “I loved the way he went and jumped the first and then, I just can’t believe it.”View image in fullscreenGolden Ace and Lorcan Williams head towards the finishing post to win the Fighting Fifth Hurdle from Anzadam at Newcastle.Photograph: Steve Davies/Racingmediapics.co.uk“It’s getting to something. Let’s all think about it and let’s not be rash, but it’s sad, it’s really sad. You can’t keep asking him to do it, it doesn’t seem fair on anybody.“Poor Michael [Buckley, Constitution Hill’s owner], I could cry for him. We’ve done everything, why has this habit crept in? It’s hard to go on watching it, but I can’t do any more.“Everybody has got their own ideas and we’ve listened to every theory in the book. His jumping has been great. His work has just been superb, but you’ve got to jump eight flights of hurdles and at the moment that’s something he doesn’t seem able to do.”The New Lion also emerged unscathed from his fall and unlike Constitution Hill he is a horse with his prime ahead of him. “They were going so fast, proper two-mile championship speed,” said Dan Skelton, The New Lion’s trainer. “It’s not ideal to be on the floor. We’ll dust ourselves down and get him jumping.

Raphinha was instrumental again in the 26th minute with another assist, this time for Olmo who expertly curled the ball home first-time from inside the box as theBlaugranawent ahead. Olmo put the result beyond doubt in added time, finishing off a smooth one-two with Lamine Yamal, whose through ball left him free inside the box to slot home with composure.Atlético Madrid’sAlexander Sørloth struck twice to give the home side a comfortable 2-0 victory over strugglingReal Oviedo, extending Diego Simeone’s winning streak to seven matches in all competitions. The Norwegian needed just 26 minutes to wrap up the points against the bottom side, who have managed only two competitive wins all season. The victory extended Atlético’s unbeaten league run to 13 matches and lifted them to third on 31 points, one point behind Real Madrid.View image in fullscreenBayern Munich’s Luis Díaz sets the Bundesliga leaders on their way to a 3-1 win over St Pauli with a goal in stoppage time.Photograph: Angelika Warmuth/ReutersThe Bundesliga leaders,Bayern Munich, needed stoppage-time goals from Luis Díaz and Nicolas Jackson to beat strugglingSt Pauli3-1, coming from behind for the second straight week and hitting the woodwork three times.

Harry Kane hit a post with a volley late in the game before Díaz put them in front early in stoppage time and Jackson added his goal at the very end to lift them to 34 points.Borussia Dortmundscored once in each half and survived a lateBayer Leverkusencomeback to win 2-1 on Saturday and leapfrog the hosts into third place in the Bundesliga. The Argentina youth international Aaron Anselmino headed home a Daniel Svensson free-kick after 41 minutes to put Dortmund in front before Karim Adeyemi headed in Fabio Silva’s cross in the 65th.Leverkusen pulled a goal back through the substitute Christian Kofane in the 83rd after Jonas Hofmann had rattled the crossbar with a powerful shot. Dortmund had conceded late equalisers in their last two league matches but despite late Leverkusen pressure they held on this time to earn the three points.“It was not easy. After the goal we conceded they put pressure on us,” said the Dortmund coach, Niko Kovac. “Today it was a good team performance.”Milansecured a hard-fought 1-0 home win overLaziothanks to Rafael Leão’s goal early in the second half to take over at the top ofSerie A. The victory put Milan on 28 points, one above second-placed Roma before their Sunday game at home to Napoli; the defending champions are third on 25 points. Lazio are eighth with 18 points.The Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan produced a moment of brilliance inside two minutes when he somehow clawed away Mario Gila’s point-blank header with a fingertip save. Despite the intense start, the first half produced few other clear chances. Maignan repeatedly snuffed out Lazio’s early attacks with solid saves, while Milan created only a handful of half-chances with the teams going into the break goalless.The hosts, however, came out with renewed vigour after the break. A well-worked move released Fikayo Tomori on the right, allowing him to drive in a low cross that Leão met with a sliding finish six minutes into the second half.In the final seconds, tension rose when Lazio appealed for a penalty after a last-ditch attempt, believing Strahinja Pavlovic handled to clear a cross. Milan’s manager, Max Allegri, was sent off for protesting against the referee reviewing the incident on the pitchside monitor; Lazio’s assistant manager, Marco Ianni, was dismissed for dissent seconds later. In the end, the referee Giuseppe Collu ruled out a penalty, judging that Pavlovic had been fouled first.Juventusclaimed a 2-1 win overCagliariafter a Kenan Yildiz double turned the match on its head. The victory brought some relief for Juve after two league draws, putting them in seventh place on 23 points.Sebastiano Esposito gave Cagliari the lead after 26 minutes, tucking the ball home from close range after a low ball from the byline found him unmarked. But Yildiz refused to let the visitors enjoy their advantage for long. Barely a minute later, he levelled the match by bending a low shot from the edge of the box into the far corner.View image in fullscreenKenan Yildiz celebrates scoring his and Juve’s second goal against Cagliari in first-half stoppage time.Photograph: Claudio Benedetto/IPA Sport/ipa-agency.net/ShutterstockJuve had seized the momentum. In first-half stoppage time, Weston McKennie’s clever back-heel went to Pierre Kalulu, who found Yildiz at the edge of the area. With two deft touches, the Turkish forward slipped between two defenders and guided a precise finish into the far corner.Takumi Minamino’s solitary strike earnedMonacoa 1-0 home win against theLigue 1leaders,Paris Saint-Germain, who slipped to their first league defeat since September and second of the season.TheMonacomidfielder Lamine Camara was fortunate to escape with a yellow card early on for a dangerous lunge on Lucas Chevalier, violently catching the goalkeeper’s right ankle after he kicked the ball. Chevalier recovered and made a good one-handed save from Minamino’s volley later in the first half.The Portugal midfielder Vitinha, who scored a brilliant hat trick in the Champions League in midweek, was kept quiet by Monaco’s hard-working midfield. PSG were exposed to counterattacks and Minamino made no mistake in the 69th, expertly controlling Aleksandr Golovin’s pass from the left and clipping the ball past Chevalier.The Monaco defender Thilo Kehrer was sent off in the 80th following a video review after shoving a PSG player in the back. Paul Pogba came off the bench in the closing stages for Monaco.PSG’s coach, Luis Enrique, said: “It’s hard to maintain consistency when you make individual errors. It was our worst match of the season. They deserved it more than we did. It was a bad night for us, a very bad night.”PSG are seven points ahead of sixth-place Monaco and one aboveMarseille, who were denied top spot by Santiago Hidalgo’s stoppage-time equaliser forToulousein a 2-2 draw, whileParis FCwere held 1-1 at home by the bottom club,Auxerre.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballLa LigaBarcelonaAlavesBayern MunichBorussia DortmundJuventusnewsShareReuse this content"

It really isn’t that much of a mysteryNaoise DolanSurvey data suggests more and more girls can’t imagine getting married, while their male counterparts are keener. That disparity holds a clueSat 29 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 29 Nov 2025 09.27 ESTShareAccording to recent data, marriages in England and Wales aredown by nearly 9%after a post-pandemic spike, while civil partnerships have risen by almost the same percentage. This downward trend is also reflectedin the US. The Vatican has piped up in defence of the institution, releasinga 40-page doctrinal note, Una Caro (One Flesh): In Praise of Monogamy: Doctrinal Note on the Value of Marriage as an Exclusive Union and Mutual Belonging. Sworn celibates would not be my personal first port of call when seeking relationship advice, but to each their own – exclusively and indissolubly, if the Catholic church is to be believed.Among the younger crowd, gendered expectations about marriage are changing, at least according toa surveyby the University of Michigan, which found that only 61% of high-school girls want to be married one day, compared to 74% of the boys. Perhaps this is behind the burgeoning genre of opinion pieces in which a rightwing man complainsthat women don’t want to date him. Often enough, he is an avowed libertarian, leaving it a mystery why he does not simply accept the workings of the free market.But what could be putting young girls, and women, off marriage? Well, for women who date men, perhaps it’s the fact thatthis is what some men’sexpectations look like: “At least 20 years younger”, “good breeder”, “taller than 5ft 6in and can’t be a Scorpio”, says 79-year-old baronet Benjamin Slade, who is (in the manner of these things) in want of a wife. I will admit to having been momentarily impressed that this would-be husband knows about astrology, all the more so by his swift conversion of it into a new and exciting way to hate women. But with my rising Scorpio, 5ft 3in stature and hips better adapted to bearing a vintage bumbag than a child, I am presumably out of the running to wed him – as are you, dear reader, since the desired candidate cannot “read the Guardian newspaper”.One potential reason for the decline of marriage occurs quite early in the pipeline: fewer people are entering the committed relationships that tend to be a prerequisite, barring impulsive antics in Vegas. According toYouGov data, half of 18- to 34-year-old Americans have been in a “situationship”, defined in theCambridge Dictionaryas “a romantic relationship between two people who do not yet consider themselves a couple but who have more than a friendship”. A central feature of such arrangements is that only one party tends to consider it a “yet”.There are also more fundamental objections to the institution itself. For me, marriage is a form of state authority and coercion that I will not endorse through my participation. Governments use tax breaks, hospital visitation rights and other financial and legal incentives to enforce their chosen relationship structures above others: non-monogamy, communal living and other non-traditional arrangements are sidelined. I do not wish to judge anyone else for marrying, whether they do it wholeheartedly or simply pragmatically – that’s none of my business. But in terms of giving pen-pushing bureaucrats the power to legislate my own private life, it’s a no from me.My view is not universal. “People Still Want to Marry. Why Aren’t They?” asked aNew York Timespodcast last month. One explanation offered is that marriage is nowconsidered a “capstone”, not a start, to adulthood: there is increased social pressure to have your finances, career and long-term living arrangements firmly settled before tying the knot, in an atmosphere where employment is becoming ever more precarious and accommodation ever less affordable. For some, marriage is also still a life event that necessarily precedes having children; but many young women will have seen where caring responsibilities fell during the Covid pandemic, and must surely be concluding that the burdens that would be placed on them as parents are impossible.The optimistic spin is that rather than being cut off from marriage, we’re not being forced into it any more.

The aggressor would be rewarded with territory and other concessions from the victim it has brutalized. Yet the horrified reaction in Washington to recent peace proposals is troubling in its own right.The Trump administration’s recent28-point plan, roundly denounced in Congress and the commentariat as a “capitulation” to Moscow, actually offered Kyiv a remarkable strategic outcome. Under its terms, Ukraine would face no meaningful limit on its peacetime military, despite Russian attempts to impose draconian restrictions since 2022. (The only requirement, a cap of 600,000 personnel, probably exceeds the number of active-duty forces Ukraine would maintain anyway.) Moreover, Ukraine would receive asubstantial security guaranteefrom the United States and Europe – the strongest in history, even if short of a Nato-style commitment.Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, launched his invasion to break Ukraine’s alignment with the west and against Moscow. When the fighting stops,Ukrainewill be militarily stronger, more hostile to Russia and better protected than ever before.Yet it is already clear that this outcome, if and when it may be realized, will be deemed unacceptable and immoral by powerful voices in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. Continuing the war indefinitely is highly likely to leave Ukraine worse off – smaller, weaker and even more devastated – but that won’t keep senators such asMitch McConnellorJeanne Shaheenfrom railing against a least-bad compromise. It is easy to call for ideal outcomes when one is thousands of miles away and pays no price for sounding morally superior.Ukraine risks becoming the latest victim of the US’s chronic inability to see the outcomes of its wars for what they are. In prior conflicts, the US has repeatedly refused to “take the win” or accept that it could not attain everything it sought. Instead, the country has become consumed with its failure to achieve absolute victory or perfect justice, and taken destructive actions as a result. It should not make the same mistake now.In prior wars, the US has struggled both to accept loss and to accept victory – two distinct manifestations of the pursuit of ideal solutions, each relevant to Ukraine’s war today.The United States has several times allowed faltering military campaigns to drag on unnecessarily for years, not because presidents believed they could pull out a win but because they wanted to avoid taking the loss. In Vietnam, Richard Nixon chased “peace with honor” by continuing to fight for four years after taking office, before finally signing peace accords in 1973. He secretly bombed Cambodia and Laos, devastating both countries, merely to delay America’s inevitable defeat. Nixon purchased a “decent interval” between America’s withdrawal and North Vietnam’s victory with enormous quantities of blood.Similarly, one decade into the war in Afghanistan, Barack Obama recognized that the Taliban would not be militarily defeated. Yet he made minimal attempts to negotiate a power-sharing arrangement that might have ended the war and preserved, in part, the US-backed government in Kabul. The United States drew down but fought on and steadily lost ground for another decade. Unable to win yet unwilling to compromise, the United States left itself no choice but to withdraw unconditionally. When it did so, the Taliban swept back to power across the country. Armchair warriors in Washington bemoaned the absence of a “decent interval” despite the indecency of their complaint: more war would only have cost more American and Afghan lives.Failing to accept losses, the United States has also, and no less damagingly, failed to accept its own wins. In 1991, under George HW Bush, the United States decisively achieved its primary aim of ejecting Iraq’s forces from Kuwait. Having proved able to reverse Iraqi aggression, the United States could have pulled back from the Persian Gulf, knowing it could return if Saddam Hussein attempted another invasion. Instead, Washington dreamed bigger. Bush called on Iraqis to “take matters into their own hands” and force Saddam from power. He thus defied America simply by surviving, and Americans concluded that their mission remained unaccomplished. The United States proceeded to “contain” Iraq through routine bombings and the first-ever open-ended deployment of tens of thousands of soldiers in the region. After 9/11, the next Bush administration decided to finish the country’s unfinished business in Baghdad, to disastrous effect. The United States squandered its original achievement in the quest for total triumph.These precedents matter in equal measure for the war in Ukraine today. The conflict is neither a clearcut defeat nor a feelgood victory, but an in-between outcome that contains profound elements of each. Ukraine has achieved astonishing successes that must be retained. It has also suffered immense losses that will not be redeemed. Ending the war requires coming to terms with both sides of that mixed verdict.On the one hand, like the US-backed governments in Saigon and Kabul, the government in Kyiv will not achieve a total battlefield victory, and it is fantastical to believe that Ukraine could do so. Even the Biden administration, despite sometimes framing the stakes of the conflict in absolutist terms, never really expected Ukraine to liberate all its territory by force. The best that can be achieved is a compromise settlement that gives Ukraine a viable chance at peace and security while allowingRussiato reap strategic and territorial gains. If this feels like a dirty deal, like some measure of appeasement, that’s because it is. But if there is no better alternative, it will be a dirty deal worth making.On the other hand, the United States and Ukraine are struggling to internalize the enormous achievement they have already attained. Nearly four years after Russia expected to overrun its opponent in four days, Ukraine still stands. The vast majority of its people and its land remain intact. Russia, meanwhile, has suffered mightily for its botched invasion, enduring upwards of 600,000 casualties – roughly 10 times the number of Soviet casualties suffered over a decade in Afghanistan – for what look to be modest gains. Ukraine has proved, as few believed before 2022, that it can impose severe costs on its enemy. If it can rebuild and retain a strong military with western help, it stands a fair chance of deterring another war once this one ends.That is a win worth taking. It may not, it is true, satisfy those in Washington or Kyiv who seek to escape all insecurity through Nato membership or a similar pledge from Ukraine’s allies to take up arms automatically in its cause. But total security is not available for Ukraine, or any country. Even if Nato admitted Ukraine, as it will not do, the alliance would provide no genuine guarantee of safety. Whatever they may pledge on paper, countries that have declined to fight for Ukraine to date are unlikely to go to war for it in the future. The last four years have shown both the lengths and the limits to which Ukraine’s partners will go.Fortunately, Ukraine does not require a geopolitical deus ex machina to survive. It needs itself, and the external support it can realistically receive. Still less does the United States, an ocean away, need a miracle to occur in Ukraine. Misplaced moralism is no reason to risk all that has been accomplished to date.Stephen Wertheim is a senior fellow in the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a visiting lecturer at Yale Law SchoolExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionRussiaTrump administrationUS foreign policyEuropeUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Now it’s just another day in America. During a holiday when many Americans were gathering with family and reflecting on what they were grateful for, Trump was crouched over his keyboard slinging insults at his perceived enemies.On Thanksgiving day, for example, Trump posted a rant onTruth Socialabout immigration. He called Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, an ableist slur, and then made an Islamophobic jab at “the worst ‘Congressman/woman’ in our Country, Ilhan Omar, always wrapped in her swaddling hijab”.It was a busy Thanksgiving for Trump, who also insulted a female journalist who was asking him about the suspect in Wednesday’s attack on two national guard members in Washington DC. “Are you stupid? Are you a stupid person?” the presidentdemanded.You don’t have to be a particularly perceptive person to know that Trump loathes most journalists – particularly women. The misogynist-in-chief has awell-documented historyof lashing out at women who dare challenge him. Still, even by his own low standards, the past few weeks have been remarkable. The president seems to be on a rage-filled downward spiral, and is taking much of his aggression out on female members of the media.On Wednesday, for example, a day before his “are you stupid?” comments, Trumpfumedonline about the New York Times, which had just published areporton how the 79-year-old is increasingly showing his age. The piece, written by Katie Rogers and Dylan Freedman, noted that the president “keeps a shorter public schedule than he used to” and has been caught dozing off. Trump did not namecheck the male co-author in his Truth Social post, zeroing in on Rogers instead. “The writer of the story, Katie Rogers, who is assigned to write only bad things about me, is a third rate reporter who is ugly, both inside and out,” the president wrote.Earlier this month, Trump also calledMary Bruceof ABC News “a terrible person” after she had the temerity to ask his pal Mohammed bin Salman, the visiting Saudi crown prince, about the killing of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Prince Mohammed, who is sometimes known asMr Bone Saw, has denied involvement in Khashoggi’s killing but a 2021 US intelligence report found the crown princeapproved the brutal murder.In the same week he attacked Bruce, Trump jabbed his finger at Catherine Lucey, Bloomberg’s White House correspondent, and said: “Quiet, piggy.” Lucey had asked Trump about the Epstein files, which is something of a sore topic.Meanwhile Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, seems keen to follow Trump’s lead when it comes to insulting female journalists. On Wednesday, the New Yorker writer Jane Meyer wrote on X that the attack on the national guardsmen was “so tragic, so unnecessary” as the national guard “should never have been deployed” to DC. Cheungwrote back: “Jane, respectfully, shut the fuck up for trying to politicize this tragedy.”It can’t be stressed enough that this isn’t just the president and his staff being a bit rude to a handful of female journalists. When the president insults these women, he opens them up to harassment from his acolytes. And, of course, he sends a message to the world about what he thinks about press freedom and what he thinks about women.According to Mary Trump, the president’s niece and a vocal critic of his politics, the president may inadvertently be sending another message with his recent behaviour. This week, Mary Trumpnoted on her YouTube showthat her uncle’s “misogynistic attacks against reporters … are increasing” and believes that this points to two things. First, that “he’s increasingly comfortable lodging such attacks”, and second, “that he’s a little rattled” because the pressure is getting to him. In response, Cheungtold the Daily Beastthat Mary Trump is a “stone-cold loser”.I don’t know if “rattled” is quite the word for what is happening in Trump’s brain. Rather it would seem that Trump, who has frequently referred to himself as a “king”, would like to turn himself into another Mohammed bin Salman and the US intoanother Saudi Arabia. In the prince’s Saudi Arabia, journalistslive under heavy surveillance, media outlets stick to the government narrative and a handful of critical tweets canget you locked up.The US might not be quite at that point yet, but it’s on the way. Mary Trump is right that the president is “increasingly comfortable” attacking female journalists. And, after all, why wouldn’t he be? He seems to suffer few consequences for these gendered attacks. Trump may wear his misogyny on his sleeve but there are plenty of women (and, of course, men) who are happy to overlook it. While it’s impossible to come up with exact numbers, polls and analysis show that amajority of white womensupported Trump in 2024 – even after he was legally defined as a sexual predatorby a New York jury. And Trump actually increasedhis support among female voters in 2024versus 2020 and 2016. Trump can apparently call female reporters “piggy” all he likes; there are still plenty of Maga sheep willing to support him.More than 240 women allege drugging by senior French civil servantThe women were given beverages during a supposed job interview with a senior civil servant. Unbeknown to the women, the drinks were mixed with a powerful and illegal diuretic that would make them need to urinate. The police found a spreadsheet titled “Experiments” on the civil servant’s computer,where he allegedly notedthe times of druggings and the women’s reactions.Italy now recognizes the crime of femicideThe new lawpunishes femicidewith life in prison.Every day, 137 women and girls are killed by intimate partners or family membersThat’s according to the2025 femicide reportfrom the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and UN Women, which notes there has beenlittle progresson the issue.The Free Birth Society is linked to baby deaths around the worldInfluencers have made huge amounts of money pushing the idea of “natural” births online and sowing distrust in the medical establishment. The result,a Guardian investigation shows, is scores of avoidable deaths.Israeli police raid Palestinian children’s play on Ben-Gvir’s ordersThe policestormed a performanceof Dreams Under the Olive Tree at El-Hakawati theater in East Jerusalem on Sunday night and forcedcrying childrento leave. The far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, gave the order to close the show, saying it didn’t have the required permit. The “you don’t have the right permit” excuse has long been invoked by Israel to bulldoze Palestinian houses and control Palestinian life. As theNorwegian Refugee Councilexplains: “Demolitions are rooted in a planning system that denies Palestinians the right to build in Area C, which covers more than 60 per cent of the West Bank and remains under full Israeli control. Palestinians must apply for permits that are almost never granted. Since October 2023, 282 applications have been submitted. Not a single one was approved.”Experts warn of ‘global crisis’ as number of women in prison nears1 millionThe number of incarcerated women is rising much faster than men, with poverty, abuse and discriminatory lawsdriving this trend.The week in poultryiarchyElon Musk is not the only power broker who seems to yearn to be astandup comedian. JD Vance addressed service members at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, ahead of Thanksgiving and attempted a poultry bit of humour. “Think about turkey,” Vance said. “Be honest with yourselves. Who really likes turkey?” When a few soldiers raised their hands he said: “You’re all full of shit.” He then riffed on this for a while before concluding: “Chicken is good all the time.” Trump is well practiced at throwing red meat to his base in speeches, but the dreadfully dry Vance always sounds as if he’s just winging it.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe Week in PatriarchyWomenGenderFemicideChildrenIsraelPalestinecommentShareReuse this content"

But, lest one forget, it is also a story about breaking the lawSat 29 Nov 2025 15.58 ESTLast modified on Sat 29 Nov 2025 18.12 ESTShareIt was 70 years ago when four African Americans were sitting in the fifth row of a bus in Montgomery. As one white man had to stand towards the front, the driver asked the four to get up and move towards the back of the bus. Three did; one did not – the rest is history. Or so many American kids might think when they first read the story of Rosa Parks in school.It is a story of courage, but, lest one forget, it is also a story about breaking the law. And the question for us today is what civil disobedience means in an era when the federal government is signaling its readiness severely to punish even perfectly legal dissent.Before getting into any arguments about how disobedience can end up strengthening democracy, it is worth reminding ourselves that the textbook version of Parks is usually not the whole story. She was not just a fatigued seamstress who, after a long day, at work, spontaneously decided to protest against injustice. Rather, Parks had been a member of the NAACP in Montgomery since 1943; she had led the organization’s youth, and she had beeninvestigating rapes of African Americanwomen in Alabama.Brand-new activists are discovering political movements – and each other: ‘You feel the camaraderie’Read moreWhat Obama once claimed – “that any of us ordinary people without rank or wealth or title or fame can somehow point out the imperfections of this nation, and come together, and challenge the status quo, and decide that it is in our power to remake this country that we love until it more closely aligns with our highest deals” – is true, but it is not the whole truth: Parks had no rank or wealth, but she had plenty of fellow activists and friends.Resistance is a matter of coordination, and coordination is helped by having an effective organization behind you. The bus boycott – which lasted a staggering 381 days – depended on organizers quickly distributing pamphlets in the Black community and on volunteers running “private taxis” (the US supreme court ruled segregation of buses unconstitutional in December 1956). Parks went on record saying: “The only tired I was, was tired of giving in.” Others were tired of it, too, but had the energy and courage to organize.What the political theorist Brandon Terry has called “our culture’s compulsive references to the civil rights movement” and, more particularly, “the apparent concord of civil rights celebration” overlook that non-violent protest against injustice was hardly popular among whites across the country. It is something Trump’s court historians, starting with the ill-fated1776 Commission, tend to leave out of their narratives; they make it seem like the entire nation loved coming together around the idea of “color-blindness” in the 1960s – and it was the only the crazy leftist proponents of identity politics who undermined that happy consensus.Civil disobedience is a “public, nonviolent, conscientious yet political act”, according to what remains its most influential definition, put forward by the towering figure in political philosophy of the second half of the 20th century, John Rawls. There are reasons to think that Rawls’s approach has become objectively more difficult to implement today. Rawls had claimed that breaking the law to point to an injustice could convince majorities to bring about change. But he was relying on a media system that allowed majorities to see injustice – think of the vicious attacks by policemen (and their dogs) on civil rights protesters in Birmingham. While information is more accessibly today – and Black Lives Matter crucially depended on acts of police brutality going viral – our media landscape is alsomuch more fragmented, with plenty of rightwingers making sure that events arereframed, which is a polite way of seeing: making sure their meaning is distorted.Rawls also relied on the notion that, in an “almost just” society, disobedience should involve being willing to accept punishment – as a demonstration of one’s overall “fidelity” to the law (which would also make it harder to have one’s conduct be portrayed as anarchism or worse). Of course, there is a general question as to whether one considers the US “nearly just”; but, more particularly, there is the evident tendency by the Trump administration to undermine the rule of law.The attorney general has seemingly given up on any independence from the executive, racing to follow Trump’s commands to exert retribution on his supposed enemies. As members of the Department of Justicehave reported, the idea is no longer that cases are brought after fact-finding; rather, cases are constructed and then the race is on to find facts that might fit. There is valiant pushback by some judges; but the structural damage and corruption have been enormous already.Rawls thought of civil disobedience as a form of “public speech”. It is unclear whether that speech will be heard. Even if it is, one might doubt whether it will get a good-faith hearing by the authorities. The philosopher had assumed that “in a state of near justice, vindictive repression of legitimate dissent is unlikely”. Today, dissent both legitimate and legal is already being targeted by Trumpists and the president himself (threatening most recently to go after citizens who, to his mind, are disturbing “domestic tranquility”). Anyone contemplating civil disobedience must have answers to challenges which, for all the injustices of the south, “the mother of the civil rights movement” did not have to face in quite the same way.Explore more on these topicsProtest (US)OpinionCivil rights movementDonald TrumpTrump administrationLaw (US)US politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Since then, teachers have reported classrooms a third empty, as parents are too scared to send their kids in – volunteers walk them there and back.In the Rogers Park area of Chicago, a group of citizens are organising to resist such immigration raids. Sometimes, it’s simple non-violent tactics, such as slowing officers down by walking in front of them.Last month, 50 people rushed to a church, where the congregation was trapped, having got word that there were ICE agents waiting outside. Maybe their most evocative tactic is whistles – coded blasts for when a convoy is suspected to be ICE agents, a different code when it’s confirmed. They have numerous accounts of undocumented migrants warned off driving right into a raid, which is galvanising, but they also see and hear dismaying things all the time: vehicles standing empty, one door open, not robbed, merely relieved of their drivers; landscape gardeners arrested off ladders. Earlier this month, the Protect Rogers Park group got 1,500 calls in a day.This isn’t unusual;people don’t like it when their neighbours are disappeared. Similar stories could be told about Kenmore Street, Glasgow, or Peckham, in London, where neighbours surrounded Home Office vans until they were forced to release their cargo and head home.But I only know aboutRogers Park from Criminal, a true-crime podcast. It’s been running for more than a decade, and covers crimes that range from the macabre to the peculiar – always introduced with the same disconcerting intonation, the host announcing “I’m Phoebe Judge” with the kind of pride and pizzazz you might use for “I’m Mr Invisible”. But who, in this episode, is the criminal?It’s plain from the start that she is not talking about the whistleblowers, and yet it still takes a while for your brain to catch up: she has got to mean the federal government. This is a huge thing to imply, only secondarily because Trump is notoriously litigious, particularly against media organisations. First and foremost, it’s a terrifying thing to articulate: if your government is breaking the law, what do laws mean? Can any be relied upon once some are breached? How do you tell the difference between living in such a society and hiding in it? In this, and a number of other episodes, Criminal is forensic, sober, but also quite unusual: a norm has settled over the reporting of ICE, where all the facts are laid out – raw numbers, painful details, the state of detention centres – except the central one, that people are being kidnapped.Hannah Arendt discussed the termGleichschaltung, roughly translatable as “coordination” or “synchronisation”. It came from the Nazi justice minister Franz Gürtner to mean, broadly, that all political, social, cultural and civic institutions had to fall in line with the totalitarian state. Such a thing can only be achieved with the complicity of everyone: the minute-by-minute decisions of people who will do anything, personally or professionally, to stay with the majority. It might mean turning a blind eye to unacceptable state actions, or it might mean insisting, with the logic of your arguments, that things are still the same when they plainly are not.View image in fullscreenPeople queue to pick up donated food at the Care for Real Rogers Park location, Chicago, 13 November 2025.Photograph: Erin Hooley/APThis is the trap many Democrats are currently in – they producepie chartsto show that the majority of immigrants snatched off the streets are not criminals, but they do not say that todetain 65,000 peopleis an authoritarian act. And this is partly a boiling-frog effect: ICE has been in existence since 2003, introduced by George W Bush after 9/11; Barack Obama was no stranger to deportations; that uptick of detainees may break records, and the sheer activity of ICE across the US is running communities ragged, but there were nearly 40,000 migrants in detention when Donald Trump took office in January. Nobody gets a memo when democracy tips into something else.But it’s not all avoidance: most people prefer to synchronise, to stick with the majority. The anthropologist Michael Maccoby, writing in The Leaders We Need almost 20 years ago, drew on the research of Erich Fromm from 1930s Germany, and summarised quite bluntly that, as Fromm predicted, only about 15% of people resisted nazism. It wasn’t because they were fervent supporters, or even, at the outset, because they were scared, but because that’s where the herd was.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The New York Times reported on a bizarre set of documents in which Marco Rubiotells diplomats in Europeto “regularly engage host governments … to raise US concerns about violent crimes associated with people of a migration background”. Bizarre as that is, it’s not why the story of Rogers Park, and the storytelling of Protect Rogers Park, is universally relevant.Don’t wait until your government is so racist that it’s lifting people off ladders while they are trying to work, or seizing kids as they are trying to get to school, before you protest. Every time you hear aggressive xenophobia and racist insinuation from those in power and check in with how it polled before you say it’s disgusting, you are building the herd that will suffocate opposition when it matters.In an event this autumn, Olly Knowles from Led By Donkeys said “The time to fight fascism isn’t five to midnight”, going on to say that he didn’t think we were at five to midnight in the UK. Someone in the audience said “What time is it?”, and it was funny because, really, who can say? It’s quite impressionistic, this metaphor, it’s not what you would call digital. But it’s the question to ask with each fresh wave of anti-migrant policy, and rhetoric, and kite-flying, and debate: what time does that make it? Because five to midnight is too late.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OpinionDonald TrumpUS immigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Scotland has recently recommitted to providing free bus travel by 2026.Asylum seekers are currently entitled to one return bus journey a week. Home Office contractors often call taxis for all other necessary journeys, whether the person concerned wants to travel by taxi or not.One subcontractor in south-east London told the BBC his company would charge the Home Office about £1,000 a day for doingas many as 15 drop-offs from a hotel where asylum seekers were staying to a GP surgery about two miles away.The government said robust new rules would mean taxis would be “strictly limited to exceptional, evidenced cases”, which could include those with physical disabilities, serious or chronic illnesses or pregnancy-related needs.The Home Office would have to sign off on such journeys.Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said there was “a risk the threshold will be set too high”, adding: “We know the Home Office does not have one consistent definition or approach for how vulnerability is assessed so there’s a real risk those who need transportation won’t get it.“The current taxi bill is more a consequence of government incompetence and poor contract management than people in the asylum system exploiting it.”He said: “The use of taxis is symptomatic of an asylum system that allows private contractors to make vast profits at the expense of the taxpayer because successive governments have failed to deliver the reforms needed to create an efficient and effective system that treats people with compassion and delivers value for money.“The government must end the profiteering contracts that will only expand with the planned use of military sites and allow people in the asylum system to work so they can support themselves.”The government also said it planned to stamp out overcharging by taxi firms and other suppliers, with regular audits and strengthened reporting requirements, which it said would reinforce transparency and accountability.The measures are part of a broader crackdown on waste in asylum accommodation and transport contracts, which the government said had already saved more than £74m in accommodation costs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also reposted a statement including the words: “hang them.”According to the site, “The Democrats and Fake News Media subversively implied that President Trump had issued illegal orders to service members. Every order President Trump has issued has been lawful. It is dangerous for sitting Members of Congress to incite insubordination in the United States’ military, and President Trump called for them to be held accountable.”Trump keeps insulting female journalists | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThe online page also features an “Offender Hall of Shame”, which includes the Washington Post, CBS News, CNN and MSNBC (now known as MS Now). Visitors can browse a searchable database of articles, along with the names of the journalists who wrote them. Each story is categorized under labels such as “bias”, “malpractice” or “left wing lunacy”.A leaderboard currently ranks the Washington Post as the top offender, with MSNBC and CBS News taking the second and third slots.Among the Washington Post articles named is areportfrom earlier this month that states the US Coast Guard would stop classifying swastikas and nooses as hate symbols, an action the Coast Guard reversed after the article was published.The Post acknowledged the quick reversal in afollow-uparticle. In itscoverageof the new tracker, the paper quoted an internal spokesperson who said: “The Washington Post is proud of its accurate, rigorous journalism.”Beyond those singled out as weekly offenders, the White House page also lists the Associated Press, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Politico and Axios among the long list of outlets it accuses of bias or misinformation.The launch of the webpage is the latest escalation in Trump’s long-running attacks on the media.

Given that other tranches of materials related to the disgraced financier included damning correspondence with high-profile individuals, many expect that still more names of the rich, famous and powerful will be named.Victims of Epstein and their advocates, including an overwhelming majority of Congress, have expressed hope that they will also learn why he was able to avoid meaningful prosecution for years despite numerous minors telling authorities that he abused them.Many also believe that these papers could lift the veil on more details of Trump’s relationship with Epstein, as the president, who had been his friend before a falling-out, is mentioned repeatedly in previously released communications.Trump, whose decision to sign the bill marked a reversal from his months-long opposition to it, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. His representatives have slammed reports of Trump’s prior ties to Epstein as “tired and pathetic attempts to distract from all the success of President Trump’s administration”.If Trump’s justice department does comply with this law – as Bondi has vowed it will – experts and observers told the Guardian that the long-fought battle for transparency could prompt deep ramifications for those named in the files. These could range from severe ostracism to legal liability.Sam Bassett, a criminal defense attorney with the Austin, Texas, firmMinton, Bassett, Flores & Carsey, explained that statutes of limitations for child sexual abuse crimes in various states have expanded in recent years.Federal lawdoes not have time limits for pursuing sex crimes involving minors.Prosecutors might be able to pursue cases and other investigations if these files “were to reveal enough evidence for somebody to seek charges and or an indictment”.“It is possible, depending on the jurisdiction,” Bassett said.That wouldn’t mean that charges would automatically result for anyone implicated with even damning evidence, given logistical constraints. “Given the passage of time, they’re going to have to be pretty selective on which kind of which case or cases they would seek prosecution on,” Bassett said.Spencer Kuvin, the top legal officer of GoldLaw and an attorney for several Epstein victims, voiced similar sentiments about possible prosecution for Epstein associates.“Once these files are released, the next step is simple: follow the evidence wherever it leads. The documents should be treated as actionable intelligence for further investigations and potential prosecution,” Kuvin said. “Every name, every communication, every corroborated act that points toward facilitation, cover-up, or participation in Epstein’s trafficking network should trigger renewed investigative scrutiny.”There is also the potential of well-warranted social ostracism for any exposed Epstein associates who have stayed off the radar so far.“People who were communicating with Epstein after his conviction in Florida should be seen by the public for what they are: individuals that were complicit or facilitated a sex trafficker,” Kuvin said.“For my clients, transparency is not the end goal – justice is. The files must be the beginning of long-overdue accountability.”Kuvin said authorities must “correct past institutional failures”.“If the files reveal misconduct inside federal agencies, the government has a duty to confront those failures openly and create structural protections, so no victim is ever sidelined again,” he said. “This isn’t just about uncovering crimes – it’s about rebuilding trust with survivors who were betrayed by the system.”Gretchen Carlson and Julie Roginsky, who pursued sexual harassment lawsuits against the former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes and co-launched the non-profitLift Our Voices, said that seeing the files was imperative. The information, in turn, could guide appropriate next steps.“I think that the possibilities are endless as to what could be the result. I think there could be more criminal charges. I think that there could be accountability, not only for individuals, but institutions or other groups that may be named,” said Carlson, who believes the files will be released. “I think there’s a tremendous amount of information out there that we’re not aware of yet.”“If you only consider the fact that we learned so much just from the emails that the House oversight committee released, then you can only imagine how much would be in the million pages of documents.”Skepticism about this disclosure persists, however, given multiple carve-outs for withholding information. This legislation does not allow redaction of names only because those identified might face embarrassment or reputational damage, but one provision does permit the withholding of documents that might impinge on ongoing investigations.Bondi, deferring to Trump’s request, has assigned a prosecutor in New York to investigate former president Bill Clinton, the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and other Trump political adversaries who once associated with Epstein. Both Clinton and Hoffman, who have not been accused of misconduct related to Epstein, have denied wrongdoing and expressed remorse for their prior association with him.Many have wondered whether the Clinton and Hoffman investigations will be used as an excuse to keep secret documents which should otherwise be subject to disclosure. The justice department’s track record on disclosing these documents – one of Trump’s campaign promises – has been spotty.Roginsky, who is among those who thinks the administration could invoke these investigations to withhold files, also noted Trump’s broad power. “The law does allow him to classify certain aspects of these files, and he has unilateral authority to determine what is classified as a matter of national security,” she said.Another possibility: “They release some of the files that are embarrassing politically to people the president wants to embarrass, that the administration wants to embarrass, but not potentially to himself or his allies.”Should the information come out as required by law, views vary on how to best present an analysis to the public. Asked whether Congress should prepare an analysis similar to the 9/11 commission report, Kuvin said “absolutely”.“This case deserves nothing less than a full, independent, public accounting. The Epstein scandal wasn’t just a trafficking operation – it was a catastrophic breakdown of federal, state and local institutions,” Kuvin said. “A 9/11-style commission, with subpoena power and independence from political influence, is the only mechanism capable of mapping out Epstein’s network, identifying systemic failures, determining who intervened, who looked the other way and why, [and] recommending safeguards to prevent anything like this from happening again.“Without a commission, we’re piecing together fragments of truth from a system that already failed these survivors once.”Carlson said that the bipartisan agreement on transparency gave her hope that there might be agreement across the aisle in next steps.“Depending on what’s in these files, both parties might decide that if both parties have people that fall down, or whatever the case may be, that it’s important for the country – and for moving us all forward – that they come together and do come up with some sort of a report.”For Roginsky, the landscape is so different that a report wouldn’t have the same impact as it did after 9/11, further underscoring the need for disclosure.“I think we are living in a very different world than we were living in after 9/11,” she said. “I think that there is such a level of mistrust right now that even a 9/11-style commission is not going to be perceived by everybody, and, certainly, I think by enough people, to be legitimate.”Jennifer Plotkin of Merson Law, a firm that has represented 33 Epstein survivors and is pursuing a lawsuit over federal authorities’ inaction on allegations decades ago, was succinct in describing what she thought should come next.“The government should accept accountability and responsibility to Epstein’s victims in the FBI by resolving the matter instead of fighting with the survivors like it is now,” Plotkin said.Asked about transparency concerns, a White House spokesperson, Abigail Jackson, said: “President Trump has been consistently calling for transparency related to the Epstein files – by releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House oversight committee’s subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends, the Trump administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Walking through the forest, Adrian Bauwens, a Wakka Wakka man, says pockets of sunlight have replaced what is “usually quite a dense canopy where’s it’s quite heavily shaded”.The towering bunya pines are afflicted by a plant pathogen known as dieback and becoming skeletal, dropping their leaves and limbs. The culprit isPhytophthora, a type of water mould that spreads through soil and attaches itself to the roots of trees, cutting off nutrient and water supply.View image in fullscreenFeral pigs are causing bunya pines to die off.Photograph: Auscape/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesBunya dieback has been an issue over the past decade but its spread is being worsened by a porcine threat. Feral pigs are “running quite wild”, Bauwens says, “trotting around in dieback areas … spreading it through the mountain by digging it up”.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe destructive invasive species use walking tracks and bike trials in the national park as “highways”, attracted by the promise of food in the bunya’s large nut-filled pine cones. “The major draw card for them is when the nuts are fruiting,” Bauwen says. “They pretty much hit every tree they can.”A forest health officer at the Bunya Peoples’ Aboriginal Corporation, Bauwen is concerned for the fate of trees, which have been described as “living fossils” and are thought to date back 145m years to the Jurassic period.View image in fullscreenA trail camera detects a feral pig north of Kuranda, Queensland.Photograph: Djabugay Bulmba Rangers“[It] is a culturally significant tree to us,” he says. Thousands ofIndigenous Australiansof different tribes once travelled long distances to converge on the Bunya Mountains, to visit and celebrate the pines. “It acted as a bit of a parliament house, where tribal disputes, marriages and ceremonies took place,” Bauwen says.Feral pigs,Sus scrofa, originate from the arrival of the first fleet and have since spread across 45% of Australia, with higher concentration in the country’s north-east. According to a2020 estimate, the pests numbered between 2.4 million and 4 million nationally, though experts say the true number is likely far higher now. Three years of favourable weather have resulted in booming pig populations, which has conservationists and Indigenous traditional custodians sounding the alarm to avoid further damage to ecologically and culturally significant sites.‘Severe ecological imbalances’Because of heavy rainfall that has yielded high nutrient loads, the scale of the feral pig problem is “much higher than what has been experienced at any point before”, says Reece Pianta, advocacy director at the Invasive Species Council. “Australian landscapes didn’t evolve for hard-hoofed animals and aggressive foragers with the mass of a feral pig … we are seeing severe ecological imbalances starting to occur.”Pianta says the council is increasingly receiving reports of pigs foraging at sea turtle nesting grounds – in places such as western Cape York and Bribie Island – and eating eggs and hatchlings.In the Northern Territoryferal pigshave become a staple part of the diet of the saltwater crocodile, helping to drive arebound in the reptile’s populationover the last 50 years. The Top End croc population consumes about six feral pigs per square kilometre of wetland floodplain annually, research estimates.Swine dining: crocodiles are thriving in the NT and it could be because of feral pigsRead moreBut Euan Ritchie, a professor of wildlife ecology and conservation at Deakin University, says it is unclear whether crocodiles can have a meaningful effect on keeping pig numbers down. “The problem with pigs is … they’re really widespread, they’re quite adaptable animals and they can breed really rapidly,” he says.Their threats are myriad. By digging up soil while searching for food, pigscontribute carbon dioxide emissionsand spread diseases and weeds.

Parks, campgrounds and sacred sites are “getting ripped to shreds”.View image in fullscreenThe invasive species dig ups creek banks, making it difficult for platypuses to dig burrows.Photograph: Djabugay Bulmba RangersFarther north, the devastating impacts of feral pigs have long been obvious to Trevor Meldrum, a Kuuku Yalangi man and an environmental operations manager at Cape York Weeds and Feral Animals. “You’ve got our rock art painting sites that are being rubbed right through – the paint’s gone,” he says. “Their excrement and the salts in their skin erode a lot of those sacred places.“We’ve got wetlands … that used to be waste deep when we were kids. Some of them will only come up to your ankles now”. The pigs, he says, are “the main destroyers.”Ritchie believes it is “probably unrealistic, unfortunately” to expect that pigs can be eradicated from large areas. “What we’ll have to do is be more strategic about areas that might be of particular concern.”Control methods includeshooting, trapping, and targeted poisoning. While private hunting can also remove pigs from the population –donations of carcassesto crocodile farms have occurred in the past – in the US, bounty programs have not helped eradicate the animals.LiveTrampling Victoria's Alps: how brumbies are destroying the native habitat – video“Effective feral pig control needs to be professional and humane and done at a landscape scale,” Pianta says. “We know that to achieve pig population reduction, you need to remove greater than 70% of their number each year.” He points to a $2m Queensland government investment in addressing the state’s feral pig problem as a step in the right direction.But Meldrum would like to see urgent investment in the northernmost part of the country, to equip Indigenous owners on the Cape York peninsula with the resources to tackle the invasive pig issue before it worsens.“We care about our country,” Meldrum says. “Prevention is better than cure any day.”Explore more on these topicsQueenslandInvasive speciesConservationNorthern TerritoryTrees and forestsIndigenous AustraliansCrocodilesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the Hiro diaper comes with an unusual companion: a sachet of freeze-dried fungi to sprinkle over a baby’s gloopy excretions.The idea is to kickstart a catalytic process that could see the entire nappy – plastics and all – broken down into compost within a year.Hiro was one of several innovations recognised this week by theFuture is Fungi Awards, which honour groundbreaking innovations using fungi to tackle some of the planet’s most urgent environmental challenges.Several forces are converging to put fungi in the spotlight, said Prof Andrew Adamatzky at the University of the West of England in Bristol, who is investigating whether fungi could be incorporated into unconventional computing circuits.“First, people are beginning to appreciate that fungi are neither plants nor animals, but their own vast and largely unexplored kingdom with extraordinary biological abilities,” he said. “Second, practical demonstrations – fungal packaging, fungal leather, fungal insulation, even fungal electronics – have shown that these organisms can replace or augment many industrial materials. Third, we’re facing urgent global challenges: waste, pollution, biodiversity loss, and climate stress.“Fungi thrive in environments that humans consider harsh or dirty, and they can turn low-value resources into something useful. They are timely organisms with exactly the sort of properties we now need.”View image in fullscreenHiro nappies come with a sachet of fungus to sprinkle over them to kickstart their breakdown.Photograph: HiroCentral to this promise is mycelium: the thread-like network that forms the bulk of a fungus. It can be grown into strong, lightweight materials using little more than agricultural waste, and some species secrete powerful enzymes capable of breaking down wood, petroleum-like compounds and various plastics.This dual ability – building structures and digesting complex molecules – make fungi unusually versatile. Mycelium can be grown into building materials, turned into biodegradable foams, used to clean up contaminated environments, or harnessed as biological factories to synthesise chemicals.Soft plastics typically take centuries to decompose, but Hiro’s goal is to compress this into 12 months by embedding plastics with a proprietary blend of fungi that activates in response to the moisture from babies’ excretions. The fungi happily grow in oxygen-poor landfill conditions and secrete enzymes that rapidly digest the carbon backbone of plastics, leaving no microplastics behind, said Hiro’s founder and CEO, Miki Agrawal.Fungi finds: UK citizen scientists make rare pink and purple discoveriesRead more“So far, we’ve shown that we’re able to do this in our lab in under six months, and now we’re testing the diapers in simulated landfill conditions in natural environments,” said Agrawal.Scientists agree the approach is plausible – up to a point. “Fungi absolutely have the ability to degrade certain plastics – especially polyurethane, polyester-based plastics, and some composite materials. In the lab, this works well and continues to improve,” said Adamatzky. “But polyethylene and polypropylene remain stubbornly resistant. Some fungi can slowly erode them, but the rates are currently far too slow for industrial-scale landfill remediation.”View image in fullscreenFungal mycelium can be grown into strong, lightweight materials.Photograph: Justin Long/AlamyPlastics are only one arena in which fungi are advancing. Two of this year’s award winners – Michroma and Mycolever – aim to turn fungi into living chemical factories that produce greener alternatives to petrochemical-derived additives, including natural food colourings and emulsifiers used in cosmetics and toiletries. Traditional versions are often carbon-intensive or rely on environmentally damaging supply chains; fungal fermentation offers a cleaner, more flexible route.Part of that flexibility comes from fungi themselves. Whereas bacteria and yeasts often need genetic engineering to make new chemicals, the broader fungal kingdom offers a much wider natural repertoire that may require no, or only minimal, engineering.“Over the last few decades, we’ve figured out that there are an estimated 5.1 million species of fungi on this planet. Advances in technology have also allowed scientists to sequence many of them, meaning we know much more about what they do – and we’ve realised they’re capable of so much,” said Britta Winterberg, the CEO and founder of Mycolever, which is using fungi to synthesise an emulsifier for personal care products.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

His Jordan-based company, Metanovation, is developing a mycelium-based firefighting foam which, unlike synthetic foams that often leach PFAS “forever chemicals” into the soil, could be grown on waste materials and biodegrade naturally after use.View image in fullscreenScientists are experimenting with the electrical behaviour of mycelial networks.Photograph: Pawich Sattalerd/ShutterstockOne of the most intriguing frontiers is the use of fungi in sensing and electronics – an idea that may sound like science fiction but is already being explored in laboratories.Researchers have shown that materials infused with living mycelium can behave a bit like simple electronic parts: they can pulse like tiny oscillators, briefly store signals like capacitors, and filter information the way basic circuits do. Grown into fabrics or foams, they also respond to light, pressure and chemicals, raising the possibility of living sensors that grow, self-repair, continually adapt to their environment and biodegrade when no longer needed.Adamatzky’s group is among those experimenting with the electrical behaviour of mycelial networks. “In the laboratory, we can record natural electrical spikes from mycelium and use them in bio-sensing, soft robotics, or unconventional computing,” he said. “Few biological systems are so multifunctional.”Full-scale fungal electronics remain speculative for now. But the aim of the Future is Fungi Awards is to accelerate precisely this kind of early-stage innovation. “This award exists to support the boldest visionaries turning fungal science into systemic change” said Susanne Gløersen, the founding CEO. “Fungi are nature’s original engineers. We’re simply giving them the platform they deserve.”Yet, extraordinary as fungi are, Adamatzky warned against assuming they could – or should – replace every conventional technology. “When used in the right context, fungi are powerful allies,” he said. “These organisms can make industry more sustainable, create new materials, and help with environmental repair, but they must be part of a broader technological and social shift.”Self-composting nappies could be a small step towards this goal. But their development also points to a larger truth: in the search for solutions to man-made problems, some of them may already be weaving quietly beneath out feet.Explore more on these topicsFungiBiologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’re seeing heavier downpours and longer dry spells, especially in summer.”Groundwater is seen as more climate-resilient than surface water but heavy summer downpours often mean more water is lost to runoff and flash flooding, while the winter groundwater recharge season may be shortening, he said.“In south-east England, where groundwater supplies about 70% of public water, these shifting rainfall patterns could pose serious challenges.”The total amount of water taken from surface and groundwater across the EU between 2000 and 2022 decreased, according to EuropeanEnvironment Agencydata, but groundwater abstractions increased by 6%, attributed to public water supply (18%) and farming (17%).It is a critical resource: across member states, groundwater accounted for 62% of the total public water supply and 33% of agricultural water demands during 2022.A spokesperson for the European Commission said its water resilience strategy “aims to help member states adapt their water resource management to climate change and to address man-made pressures”.The strategy aims to build a “water-smart economy” and is paired with a commission recommendation on water efficiency, which calls for improving efficiency by “at least 10% until 2030”. With leakage levels varying from 8% to 57% across the bloc, the commission says cutting pipe losses and modernising infrastructure will be crucial.Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, said: “It’s distressing to see this long-term trend, because we’ve seen some very large droughts recently and we’re constantly hearing that this winter we might have less than usual rainfall andwe’re already in drought.“Next spring and summer, if we don’t get the rainfall we need, there will be severe consequences for us here in England. We will face severe water restrictions and that will make everybody’s life very difficult.”The Environment Agency has already warned England to prepare for drought continuing into 2026 unless there is significant rain over autumn and winter.The water minister, Emma Hardy, said there is “increasing pressure on our water resources. That is why this government is taking decisive action, including the development of nine new reservoirs to help secure long-term water resilience.”But simply “promising very large reservoirs that won’t come online for a few decades is not going to solve the problem immediately,” said Cloke.“We should be focusing on water reuse, using less water in the first place, separating drinking water from those recycled waters that we could use, using nature-based solutions, and thinking about the way that we’re building developments,” she said.“We’re just not doing these things fast enough to keep pace with these long-term trends.”When the rains don’t come: how drought and endless dry seasons are changing life in Puntland – in picturesRead moreEurope’s drying trend will have “far-reaching” impacts, hitting food security, farming and water-dependent ecosystems, especially groundwater-fed habitats,” according to Shamsudduha. Spain’s shrinking reserves, he said, could directly affect the UK, which relies heavily on Spain and other European countries for fruit and produce.The kinds of climate impacts long seen across the global south, from south Asia to Africa and the Middle East, are now “much closer to home”, with climate change “clearly affecting Europe itself”.“We need to accept that climate change is real, it’s happening and it’s affecting us,” Shamsudduha said, calling for better water management and openness to “new, even unconventional” ideas, including widespread rainwater harvesting in countries such as the UK.Globally, drying hotspots are emerging across the Middle East, Asia, South America, along the US west coast and across swathes of Canada, with Greenland, Iceland and Svalbard also showing dramatic drying trends.In Iran, Tehran is closing in on “day zero” when no tap water is available, and water rationing is being planned. The country’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has said thatif rationing fails, Tehran may have to be evacuated.Explore more on these topicsWaterEnvironment AgencyAccess to waterClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

We also know that illegal waste disposal can create a big concern for local communities in terms of smell, eyesore and littering.“We have illegal waste sites in Essex that regularly catch fire with the potential to harm local air quality and human health.”‘The new narcotics’: how waste crime is causing environmental disaster across the UKRead moreThe high estimated number of illegal sites suggests the authorities are barely scratching the surface of the crisis. In the year 2024-2025, the Environment Agency (EA) shut down743illegal waste sites in England and the agency’s waste investigations data showed1,143ongoing cases of illegal dumps.Yet Air & Space Evidence said the EA was not interested in using its intelligence tool, which could help inform law enforcement where to look for illegal waste sites.“When we spoke with theEnvironment Agencythere was much interest at the technical level, but at the management level there was no interest,” said Ray Harris, the company’s director and emeritus professor of geography at University College London.“From the outside, this looks like a fear of finding out. If the Environment Agency finds more illegal waste sites then they feel they will have to do something about them. So, they would rather not know.”Air & Space Evidence says its detection tool has been tried out by authorities in New Zealand, where law enforcement confirmed waste at all 125 suspected landfill sites, 58% of which were previously unknown to them.The estimated number of sites in the UK was calculated by examining detailed satellite images of areas including London, Brussels and Bucharest – as well as parts of New Zealand – and using that to model the average number of sites across the country.The figure of 8,000 sites is at the lower end of the estimate; the researchers found there could be as many as 13,000.In October, a House of Lords report highlighted widespread failings within the EA, the poor performance of its joint unit for waste crime, and the limited engagement of police in addressingwhat has been dubbed “the new narcotics”.View image in fullscreenThousands of tonnes of illegal waste dumped in 2024 within Hoad’s Wood, an ancient woodland in Ashford, Kent.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA“Despite the scale and seriousness of the crimes, raised by the members of the public in many cases, we have found multiple failings by the Environment Agency and other agencies, from slow responses to repeated public reports (as in the case ofHoad’s Wood, Kent) through to a woeful lack of successful convictions,” Lady Sheehan, chair of the Lords’ environment and climate change committee, said in her report.Criminals dumped 35,000 tonnes of rubbish in Hoad’s Wood, saddling taxpayers with a £15m cleanup cost, and in Oxfordshire,the Kidlington siteis thought to hold several hundred tonnes of household and commercial waste. According to the committee, there are six sites of similar or greater size than these, which they say points to a “fundamentally broken system”.EA waste crime data shows ongoing cases have been open for an average of four years. There are 13 cases that have been open for 11 years, some involving the burning of hundreds tonnes of asbestos.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Is the landfill tax counterproductive and creating an environmental catastrophe that will only get worse?” he said.An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “Illegal waste dumping is appalling, and we work tirelessly to protect the environment and communities from it.“Investigations can be multilayered and complex as we look to bring rogue operators – often from the criminal underworld – to justice.“Last year alone our dedicated teams successfully stopped activity at 743 illegal waste sites, and we’re doubling staff in our joint waste crime unit to help crack down on these miserable crimes.”Shlomo Dowen ofUK Without Incineration Networksaid: “These illegal waste sites are known to local people.“They often raise the alarm to councils and the Environment Agency and when no action is taken they stop reporting it, because they lose faith in the system and give up on the expectation that the EA is capable of protecting them and the environment.”Explore more on these topicsWasteEnvironment AgencyLandfillnewsShareReuse this content"

What’s wrong with that? Let’s go back to that.”Treasury insiders insist that civil servants had long identified Motability as a scheme that needed to be rebalanced, and that the public felt it was unfair for luxury vehicles to be subsidised.And it was indeed the Treasury, rather than the Department for Work and Pensions, that was primarily pushing for changes to be made, working up proposals over several months.Originally, the Times story suggested, the government appeared to favour a more drastic option of making £1bn of savings primarily by putting VAT on the scheme’s sales of Motability vehicles at the end of the lease period – but sources say this was abandoned after ministers were given warnings by the operator that the whole programme could collapse. Treasury insiders dispute that that figure was ever on the table.View image in fullscreenA car being offered through the Motability scheme in London.Photograph: Benjamin John/AlamyGovernment insiders also dispute that Treasury ministers had any idea that rightwing X accounts were running a campaign against Motability or that it had any influence over their decision-making.But other Whitehall sources say it is “not true” that the Treasury was unaware of pressure from the right to take action, and that Motability was seen as an easy target to “get a win on welfare” after the collapse of Labour’s disability benefit cuts.There are, certainly, few in Westminster who are unaware of the memes and data being pumped out on social media to undermine the scheme, primarily the anonymous Max Tempers account and the Motability Check website, which allowed people to ask whether any number plate was likely to be a Motability car or not.The website, taken down since the budget, was accused of fuelling hostility against disabled people in real life, and was said by experts to rely on dubious data.From there, newspapers such as the Telegraph and Mail picked up the baton. The main line of attack was that claimants were allowed to make higher payments to get premium brands such as Mercedes or BMW, which critics said fuelled demand for the scheme among people with conditions that did not visibly impair mobility, such as ADHD or anxiety – a minority of claimants.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s the sort of thing that happens.“What you don’t want is someone to just react instantly to what they see on social media, partly because lots of it is junk or distorted. But it’s not bad to pick up ideas from lots of places. Political parties don’t have a monopoly on suitable cases for attention.”A government spokesperson said that officials had engaged extensively with theMotability Foundationto understand the potential impacts of any changes, and noted that “Motability customers will still be able to lease a car with just their qualifying disability benefit, as there will still be cars available through the scheme which require no advance payment”.They added: “As well as ensuring disabled people can access vehicles, we’re also committed to reforming Motability and saving the taxpayer £1bn over five years.”View image in fullscreenA Cabin car mobility scooter used in a Mobility promotion in Southport.Photograph: MediaWorldImages/AlamyHowever, disabled groups say there was no consultation with them from the government, and they would have pointed out that many bigger and more premium cars are more suitable for severely disabled users.“For example, you need a solid-built car to be able to take the heft of a wheelchair hoist,” said Cat Whitehouse, co-chief executive of the Transport for All group, which coordinated a letter by 40 disability organisations warning against Motability cuts.“It is great when politicians listen to the views of society, but when they’re pushing the rhetoric of the rightwing populist press and social media, rather than listening to all of society, then we have a problem,” she said.Whitehouse also said the changes would make life more expensive and difficult for many disabled people, pricing some out of using a car, highlighting a saying in the policymaking world that “if you’re not at the table, you’re probably for lunch”.As for Reeves, she appears comfortable with her decision on Motability.Asked on Friday if the changes were made as a result of online rightwing talking points, she told the Guardian: “Not at all. And actually it’s been welcomed by people, these changes.

This includes housing benefit and universal credit because she is on a low income, along with the disability living allowance (DLA) of £103.10 a week her eight-year-old daughter, who is autistic, receives to assist with personal care and mobility.Previously, many people were able to apply for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) after five years. The government announcement has extended the timeframe before many can apply for this.The carer is among those on what is known as the “10-year route”, whereby people have to pay thousands to renew their temporary leave to remain every 30 months for a decade before being eligible for ILR. Under the proposed changes the period before they can apply has been extended to 20 years.The government has also proposed that those who have accessed benefits for more than 12 months will face a 20-year wait, extended from the current five years under certain visa routes.The woman, who has completed nine of her 10 years, said lawyers from her community had been circulating TikTok videos warning people about how their eligibility for ILR would be significantly impacted if they claimed benefits.“I heard about these changes and decided to cancel all my benefits,” she said. “The only way I will be able to manage to pay my rent and feed my children is if I increase my working hours as a carer to 60 hours a week. Some weeks I’m already working 50 hours, but I need to increase my hours now.“My daughter, who is autistic, does not sleep much so I am constantly exhausted. My body is in so much pain. I need to try to get some medication from the doctor to deal with this pain so that I will be able to work the extra hours.”She said she had only started claiming in-work benefits on the advice of her daughter’s school. “The teachers said I should work fewer hours so I could spend more time with my children. I’ve stopped the benefits, even though I need them because I’m so scared I will not be able to get my settlement in the UK.“It feels so unfair that I accessed benefits because I’m on a low wage and now that is being used against me. It was a difficult decision to ask for my benefits to be stopped, especially my daughter’s DLA, but I didn’t know what else I could do. I don’t have a voice.”Nick Beales, the head of campaigning at the charity Ramfel (Refugee and Migrant Forum of Essex and London), which is providing support for the woman said: “The government’s ‘earned settlement’ plans clearly discriminate against south Asian, African and Caribbean migrants, who make up the vast majority of people on the existing 10-year route to settlement. The intersection between classism and racism is clear, with the government making clear that they consider lower-paid work as less valuable and worthwhile.“People such as this woman now face a stark choice: continue receiving essential state support issued to her disabled child and lock herself out of permanent immigration status or sacrifice that support to her child’s detriment in the hope that she will still eventually secure permanent status. Her case is not an isolated incident.”A government spokesperson said: “As the home secretary hasset out, under our proposed new settlement model, individuals will have the opportunity to reduce the qualifying period to settlement and citizenship based on contributions to the UK economy and society. We have launched the consultation and encourage overseas workers to take part.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumBenefitsWelfareUniversal creditShabana MahmoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Roads, avenues, terraces, lanes, crescents, closes, drives and ways are all afflicted – to the dismay of some residents.In Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland, Prince Andrew Way, celebrating Mountbatten-Windsor’s 1986 marriage to Sarah Ferguson, will be purged afterMid and East Antrim council passed a motion,described by one councillor as “sad but necessary”, to rename. A public consultation is under way.Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s name to be hyphenated, as decreed by late queenRead moreIn Maidenhead, Berkshire, there is a double whammy of Prince Andrew Road adjoining Prince Andrew Close, where some residents have complained of “surface-level embarrassment” , “smirks” and “raised eyebrows” whenever they give their address. The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead this week made it easier for any name change, tailoring its regulations to require two-thirds of residents to agree, where previously all had to. It does not have a timeline for any changes, but is working through it internally.There are others, too, that will be considering options following theformal strippingof Mountbatten-Windsor of his styles and titles in the fallout over sex allegations he has always denied relating to Virginia Giuffre, a victim of the US financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Cambridge, Hitchin, Telford, Newport, Enniskillen and Dungannon all have roads bearing his name and royal prefix. A road in Norwich, however, is disputed, with one local councillor claiming it is in fact named after Prince Philip’s father, Prince Andrew of Greece.It will not be an easy process, however. Details on residents’ bank accounts, credit cards, driving licences, utility bills, property deeds, even pet microchips, will have to change, as will business letterheads and cards.View image in fullscreenBlack Boy Lane in Tottenham, north London, was renamed after John La Rose, a black publisher, writer and local activist after the Black Lives Matter protests.Photograph: Matthew Chattle/Rex/ShutterstockCrucially, there also has to be consensus on any new name, which is not always easy. When Black Boy Lane in Tottenham, north London,was renamedin 2023 after Black Lives Matter protests over claims it was linked to slavery, it took Haringey council three years and cost at least £50,000 in reimbursing residents in 168 properties for the expense of changing addresses.The road was eventually renamed La Rose Lane, after John La Rose, a black publisher, writer and local political activist. But in the weeks that followed, residents on the road reportedly put up their own “Black Boy Lane” signs in windows in protest and a graffiti mural featuring the street’s original name was painted on the wall behind the road sign, since removed.Councils must also consult with the emergency services and Royal Mail to avoid duplicates and confusion. To cover administrative costs, councils can charge a fee, varying from authority to authority. Land Registry legal fees, Google maps, sat navs – there are far-reaching implications.Perhaps it is for this reason that the GeoPlacebest-practice manual on street namesdiscourages the use of names of living people, because of the risk of an Andrew-like situation.View image in fullscreenThe sign for Plaza Margaret Thatcher, in the north-east quadrant of Plaza Colon in Madrid, has been repeatedly vandalised.Photograph: Veronica Garbutt/Rex/ShutterstockThe dead can also be problematic. The sign for Plaza Margaret Thatcher, named in Madrid in 2014, has been repeatedly vandalised, and politicised, even briefly being unofficially renamed Bobby Sands Plaza on the 40th anniversary of the death of the IRA member who died on hunger strike in the Maze prison. Meanwhile, Churchill Street in Tehran, where the British embassy was based, was officially renamed Bobby Sands Street in 1981, a problem the embassy swerved by creating a new entrance in next-door Ferdowsi Street, safely named after the Persian poet Ferdowsi, an Iranian hero.Bristol city council, despite calls from some, has not changed streets named after the 17th-century trade slaver Edward Colston, a council spokesperson confirming this week that there are no open consultations on the subject.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the Labour government has not introduced the secondary legislation – the regulations – to define precisely what “sufficient local support” means or to mandate a specific process, such as a formal referendum with a two-thirds majority.“All we’ve got now is section 81 of the 2023 act. And that means it’s a matter for the local authority to alter the name, and the operation needs to have the necessary support,” said Harewood.Whether that was simply a vote of residents in the street, or getting a two-thirds majority, “none of that has been clarified”.Local authorities “would have to make a judgment whether the alteration has the necessary support and that it has sufficient local support”, which, he added, “is a bit muddy.”Removing plaques seems a lot easier. In the Falkland Islands, four plaques unveiled by the former prince, who fought in the 1982 conflict with Argentina, have reportedly been removed, including one at a school and another at a hospital. An MoD spokesperson told the Guardian a plaque marking the opening of the £300m RAF Mount Pleasant airbase in 1985 had also gone, but was in fact removed during renovations before the Epstein allegations and just never put back up.Explore more on these topicsLocal governmentAndrew Mountbatten-WindsornewsShareReuse this content"

Prasad noted that these deaths appeared tied to myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle.“This is a profound revelation,” Prasad wrote in the memo to staff members. “For the first time, the US FDA will acknowledge that Covid-19 vaccines have killed American children.”He also wrote that new rules would impose tight restrictions on vaccines for pregnant women, marking another significant change in the agency’s approval framework.“I remain open to vigorous discussions and debate,” Prasad wrote, reportedly adding that staff who did not agree with the core principles of his new approach should submit their resignations.A PBS NewsHour correspondent first reported on the memo’s contents ina poston X. TheNew York Timesnoted that the document did not include identifying details such as the children’s ages, any existing health conditions, or how the causal relationship between vaccination and death was determined. The vaccine manufacturers involved were also not named.Dr Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who reviewed the memo, told MedPage Today that it was a “dangerous and irresponsible thing to do”.“[Prasad] says he has evidence that this vaccine killed 10 children, but that’s not the way it works,” Offit said. “If you think you have an extraordinary claim, you should back it up with extraordinary evidence. He should have submitted it to an excellent journal where it can be reviewed by subject matter experts who can say, ‘Yes, this is clear evidence,’ then it can be published. That’s the way it works.”Prasad’s predecessor, Dr Peter Marks, who led the FDA division throughout the pandemic, told theNew York Timesthat he was taken aback by the “clearly political tone of the communication” and noted that the case reports of child deaths needed to be further investigated.“I would not be surprised if the attributions turn out to be debatable, as these cases are often quite complex,” Marks told the Times after reading the memo.Current and former FDA staff, as well as outside public health specialists, said the new plan could dramatically slow the vaccine pipeline, according to theWashington Post. Requiring far larger studies before granting approvals, they said, could delay product launches and make companies more cautious about developing or expanding vaccines and may discourage innovation in vaccine research.Additionally, Prasad’s insistence on re-evaluating whether multiple vaccines should be given together could upend years of established federal guidance. The immunization schedule of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends giving multiple childhood vaccines at the same medical visit. It also encourages adults to receive several shots for respiratory viruses, including the flu, Covid and RSV, during a single appointment for convenience.Dr Kathryn Edwards, a vaccine expert and professor emeritus at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, told MedPage Today that the “determination of the cause of death in cases that are temporally related to vaccine administration is a very difficult task”.“Saying definitively that a vaccine caused a death requires careful assessment, best done with an autopsy examination, and ruling out other causes of death,” she said. “That Covid vaccine might have caused a death related to myocarditis may indeed be the case. But [we] would need to see the details.”Edwards added that such details would “best be presented in a peer-reviewed manuscript where experts could review the details”.“We also need to remember that Covid disease caused deaths [in kids], many more than 10,” she said. “I spent the entire pandemic reviewing cases of adverse events, I would be delighted to review these cases and assess the evidence that they have to say that they are vaccine caused.”Prasad’s new framework reflects several themes long advanced by Kennedy and members of the anti-vaccine movement, who have pressed for additional proof of vaccine safety and effectiveness. In August, the FDA placednew restrictionson who can get Covid vaccines.The agency authorized Covid vaccines for people 65 and older, who are known to be more at risk from serious illnesses from Covid infections. Younger people, though, were only considered to be eligible if they had an underlying medical condition that makes them particularly vulnerable.In September, Kennedy’s vaccine panel that advises the CDCvoted againstrecommending that people obtain a prescription for a Covid-19 vaccine, but added that coronavirus immunizations should be based on “individual-based decision making”.Last week, it was reported that Ralph Abraham, a top Louisiana health official who stopped promoting mass vaccination policies and once described Covid-19 vaccines as “dangerous”, had beenappointedas the new deputy director of the CDC.Previous FDA leaders and independent scientists have emphasized that Covid-19 vaccines underwent extensive testing, including pediatric studies, and have been provensafe and effective. They argue that the benefits of vaccination far exceed the risks, which remain rare.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Whether intended as a taunt or a threat, his musings are a reminder that, even barred from the ballot, Trump is likely to remain a central figure in the campaign to succeed him.The next Republican nominee faces the potentially enormous task of leading a party that has been entirely reoriented around Trump into a post-Trump era. Here’s a look at theRepublicansbest positioned for a White House run.JD VanceVice-presidentView image in fullscreenJD VanceNext in line to the presidency at just 41, Vance is widely viewed as the heir apparent in a Trump-aligned GOP. A one-time Trump critic who authored the best-selling book, Hillbilly Elegy, Vance is now firmly in the Maga orbit, preaching economic populism and cultural conservatism. He is staunchly “America First” and a leader of the “new right” populist movement that is nationalistic, anti-elite and deeply religious. Early polls and strategists indicate that Vance would emerge as an early frontrunner, especially if he had Trump’s backing. Trump has repeatedly praised Vance’s work as his vice-president, but has indicated that there are other capable contenders.Marco RubioSecretary of state, interim national security adviserView image in fullscreenMarco RubioRubio, 54, has become one of Trump’s most trusted confidants – a surprising turn for the former rivals. Rubio, once derided by Trump as “Little Marco” during the 2016 primary, is now praised by the president as a loyal and capable ally, and even floated as a potential successor or running mate to JD Vance. Before joining the administration, the Florida senator built a reputation as a foreign-policy hawk. Now, he is the chief architect of the administration’s hardline Venezuela strategy, including lethal strikes on suspected drug-running vessels – a stance that has put him at odds with some Maga isolationists.Donald Trump JrPresident’s eldest sonView image in fullscreenDonald Trump JrTrump’s eldest son, 47, has no formal political experience but remains one of the most recognizable figures in the Maga movement. A fixture at rallies and a popular draw with the Republican base, he channels his father’s combative style and culture-war messaging. Trump Jr has repeatedly said he has “zero interest” in running in 2028, though he has also said that a future bid isn’t “100%” off the table. His last name alone ensures he will remain part of the conversation, and some allies believe a Trump-once-removed candidacy could appeal to voters who want continuity.Ted CruzTexas senatorView image in fullscreenTed CruzIn recent months, Cruz has taken sharp aim at internal tensions roiling Trump’s base. He has publicly challenged the conservative host Tucker Carlson – accusing him of promoting antisemitic rhetoric – and defended hawkish foreign-policy views, including strong support for Israel that echoes the pre-Trump GOP. Cruz won the Iowa caucuses in 2016, beating Trump before eventually dropping out and becoming an ally. With a popular political podcast and a reputation as a sharp-edged conservative with deep ideological conviction, Cruz has strong sway among the libertarian and evangelical wings of the party – a base he hopes could propel a second White House bid.Ron DeSantisGovernor of FloridaView image in fullscreenRon DeSantisThe Florida governor, term-limited in 2026, is widely viewed as maneuvering to re-enter national politics once out of office. After his faltering 2024 presidential campaign against Trump, DeSantis has tried to rebuild his standing by promoting congressional term limits and aligning himself more closely with key elements of the president’s agenda. He has not ruled out a 2028 bid, while dismissing questions as “presumptuous”. While his influence in the national GOP has faded, DeSantis retains a sizable following among conservative voters who see him as a disciplined, policy-driven alternative.Much could change as the Trump presidency evolves, reshaping alliances and opening space for new presidential contenders.

Over the course of a friendly walk through the company offices, Karp fields no questions about Palantir’scontroversial ties to ICEbut instead extolls the company’s virtues, brandishes a sword and discusses how he exhumed the remains of his childhood dog Rosita to rebury them near his current home.“That’s really sweet,” host Molly O’Shea tells Karp.If you are looking to hear from some of tech’s most powerful people, you will increasingly find them on a constellation of shows and podcasts like Sourcery that provide a safe space for an industry that is wary, if not openly hostile, towards critical media outlets. Some of the new media outlets are created by the companies themselves. Others just occupy a specific niche that has found a friendly ear among the tech billionaire class like a remora on a fast-moving shark. The heads of tech’s largest companies, including Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Satya Nadella and more, have all sat for long, cozy interviews in recent months, while firms likePalantirand Andreessen Horowitz have branched out this year into creating their own media ventures.At a time when the majority ofAmericans distrustbig techandbelieve artificial intelligence will harm society, Silicon Valley has built its own network of alternative media where CEOs, founders and investors are the unchallenged and beloved stars. What was once the province of a few fawning podcasters has grown into a fully fledged ecosystem of publications and shows supported by some of the tech industry’s most powerful.While pro-tech influencers like podcast host Lex Fridman have for years formed a symbiotic relationship with tech elites like Elon Musk, some firms have decided this year to cut out the middleman entirely. In September, the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz announced that it had launched an a16z blog on Substack. One of its prominent writers, investor Katherine Boyle, hasa longstanding friendshipwith JD Vance. Its podcast has meanwhile grown to more than 220,000 subscribers on YouTube, and last month hosted OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, whocounts Andreessen Horowitzas a major investor.“What if the future of media isn’t controlled by algorithms or legacy institutions, but by independent voices building directly with their audiences?” the firm wrote in its Substack announcement. The firm once invested $50m in the digital media upstart BuzzFeed with a similar vision, only to see it fall into penny stock territory.The a16z Substack also announced this month that the firm was launching an eight-week new media fellowship for “operators, creators, and storytellers shaping the future of media”. The fellowship includes collaborating with a16z’s new media operation, which it describes as being made up of “online legends” creating a “single place where founders acquire the legitimacy, taste, brandbuilding, expertise, and momentum they need to win the narrative battle online”.In addition to a16z’s media effort, Palantir launched a digital and print publication earlier this year called the Republic that mimics academic journals and thinktank-style magazines like Foreign Affairs. The journal is funded by the Palantir Foundation for Defense Policy and International Affairs, a non-profit of which Karp is the chair, though he only works there 0.01 hours per week, according to 2023 tax filings.“Far too many people who should not have a platform do. And there are far too many people who should have a platform but do not,” states the Republic, which has an editorial team made up of senior Palantir executives.A sampling of the articles the Republic has published includes an essay arguing that US copyright law restrictions will prevent US AI dominance and another from two Palantir employees on how Silicon Valley working with the military is good for society, a point Karp has himself mademany times.The Republic joins a burgeoning set of pro-tech publications like Arena magazine, which was founded late last year by the Austin-based venture capitalist Max Meyer. The outlet takes its motto, “The New Needs Friends”, from Disney’s film Ratatouille.“At Arena, we don’t cover ‘the news.’ We cover The New,” a letter from the editors stated in its inaugural issue. “Our mission at Arena is to cheer on the people who are, slowly but surely – and sometimes very quickly! – bringing the future into the present.”The letter echoes a sentiment shared by its founder, who has criticized publications like Wired and TechCrunch for being too critical in their coverage of the industry.“The magazines that have historically covered this area are just super negative now. By being bold and positive, we’re going to battle with them,” Meyer told Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of Palantir, on the latter’s podcast.Some parts of tech’s new media scene have also grown more organically, rather than being created as an official corporate media arm – even if the optimistic overall tone is similar. The TBPN video podcast, which reimagines tech industry minutiae like hirings as a high-stakes drama akin to an NFL draft, has rapidly grown in influence since launching late last year. The show’s self-aware yet pro-tech vibe has attracted prominent fans and guests, including Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, who gave an in-person interview in September to promote Meta’s smart glasses.Another podcaster, 24-year-old Dwarkesh Patel, has similarly built out a miniature media empire in recent years through long, collegial interviews with tech leaders and researchers about artificial intelligence. Earlier this month Patel talked with Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, who gave him a tour of one of the company’s newest datacenters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since the billionaire bought Twitter in 2022, the company has throttled links to critical news outlets and set up autoreplies that return poop emojis when reporters reach out for comment. He has seldom given interviews to established media outlets, but appears for long sit-downs with sympathetic hosts like Lex Fridman and Joe Rogan, in which his opinions go largely unchallenged.Musk’s embrace of creating a media bubble around himself has also shown how detached this kind of content can become from reality and result in the pursuit of alternative facts. The billionaire’s longstanding discontent with Wikipedia led him this year to create the AI knockoff Grokipedia, whichgenerates blatant falsehoodsand results that fit his own far-right worldview. Musk’s chatbot Grok has meanwhile repeatedly expressed opinions that mirror the billionaire’s own opinions orgo to ludicrous lengths to flatter him, including last week claiming that he was fitter than LeBron James and could beat Mike Tyson in a boxing match.The rise of tech’s new media is also part of a larger shift in how public figures are presenting themselves and the level of access they are willing to give journalists. The tech industry has a long history of being sensitive around media and closely guarded about their operations, a tendency that has intensified following scandals likethe Facebook filesthat have exposed internal documents and potential harms. In one example of how skittish some in tech have become around negative press, journalist Karen Haowrites in her 2025 book, Empire of AI, that OpenAI did not officially speak to her for three years following a critical profile she did on the company in 2019.Tech’s move towards sympathetic outlets and in-house media creation also mirrors a strategy the entertainment industry took on years ago. Film and album release press tours have long been tightly controlled affairs, where actors and musicians go through a gauntlet of easily vetted, low-stakes interviews on shows like Hot Ones. Politicians have embraced a similar model – as was evident during Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign tour of podcasters like Theo Von, or California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, launching his own politics podcast earlier this year – which offers them both access to new audiences and a safer space for self-promotion.Even if much of this new media isn’t aiming to expose wrongdoing or challenge people in power, it is not exactly without value. The content that the tech industry is creating is frequently a reflection of how its elites see themselves and the world they want to build – one with less government regulation and fewer probing questions on how their companies are run. Even the most banal questions can also be a glimpse into the heads of people who exist primarily in guarded board rooms and gated compounds.“If you were a cupcake, what cupcake would be?” O’Shea asked Karp on Sourcery presented by Brex.“I don’t want to be a cupcake because I don’t want to be eaten,” Karp said. “I’m resisting becoming a cupcake.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But just as she finished recording it, she got a shock diagnosis. She explains why it’s made her determined to be in the momentSat 29 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTShareYou couldn’t make it up,Jessie Jsays. There she was preparing for her first album release in eight years, ecstatically in love with her newish partner, and finally the mother of a toddler having struggled to conceive for a decade, on top of the world. Then in March she was diagnosed with breast cancer.The singer-songwriter, real name Jessica Cornish, is famous for telling it as it is. The album, Don’t Tease Me With a Good Time, was supposed to be an open book, dealing with every ounce of devastation she’d experienced since she last recorded music (endometriosis, miscarriage, failed relationships, gaslighting, suicide) with typical candour. The first single, No Secrets, was released in April. But by then there was a mighty secret. The cancer. Then second single, Living My Best Life, came out in May and Cornish was giving interviews about how she was living her best life, while still secretly living with breast cancer.A month later she went public, and in early July she had a mastectomy.She gives me her best “What the fuck?” look. “I come out with a song called No Secrets. I’m doing every interview, and they’re, like, ‘So what’s new with you?’ and I’m, like, ‘Erm, yeah, nothing …’” Cornish has just had tocancel tour datesbecause she’s still waiting for reconstructive surgery.We’re at a photo studio in London. She is wearing a beige fake-leather jacket, blue jeans with elaborate white patches, cream boots and oversized specs. Think biker chic meets 1970s Nana Mouskouri. “I feel like I’m in the 70s and I should have a boyfriend with a big tache.” Easy Rider, I say, thinking of the film. “That’s what people called me at school!” She grins. Cornish is quick, irreverent and filter-free. She says she has always fancied doing comedy, and is hoping to make her standup debut next year. “I love making people laugh. On stage I basically roast the audience.”Video of Jessie J twirling around in a strapless black dressCornish was preparing for an appearance at the Baftas when she found a lump. “I immediately went to get it looked at, had an ultrasound, and they were, like, ‘It looks like nothing; you’ve got really good dense breast tissue.’ And I was, like, ‘But I can feel it. I’ve got an achy arm and pins and needles in my hands whenever I wake up.’ And they said, ‘Well, let’s just do a biopsy.’ That was 28 March, the day after my birthday.” It was a Friday. The doctor told her if it was bad news she’d call on the Monday. By then Cornish had convinced herself it was nothing. The way she tells it, it was simply too inconvenient to get cancer when she had so much on.“We’re two weeks away from launching this thing after eight years without an album and four years without a single. And she [the doctor] texted and said, ‘Are you free at six?’ And I was, like, ‘Oh, it’s a Zoom, it won’t be anything.’ So I jump on the Zoom thinking it’s all going to be good, and she goes, ‘Are you sitting down?’ You know that sad tone they use? And she says, ‘I’m so, so sorry, but your test results have come back as high-grade cancer cells.’” How did you respond? “I said, ‘Oh, that’s not ideal, is it? That’s not fucking great timing.’ The first thing I thought was, ‘I can’t die because my son needs me.’”Men have called me difficult because I’m a strong person who understands who I amView image in fullscreenDress: AjeShe found the surgery terrifying and absurd. “I hate being put under. They walk you down. You know when you have emergency surgery you roll down in a bed, but this time I just strolled down with a gown on and my bum hanging out. You feel like you’re in an episode of Black Mirror.” But, Cornish says, she’s been lucky. No chemo, no radiotherapy, just the op. “Cancer sucks, man, but you know what? Thank fuck I found it early. I had the mastectomy four months ago and my right breast now looks like a grapefruit under a tight bedsheet.” Another grin. “I got to keep the nipple, though.”The next operation is both medical and cosmetic. Her boobs, she notes, are now “different sizes.They didn’t do an implant as small as my original. Howrude! I thought, no need to bully me, I’m already having a rough time.Sorude! It’s funny because I said I’d never get my boobs done because I’ve got OCD, and I know they’d never be perfect. Cancer ruined that plan.”Cornish is no stranger to illness. She thinks her perspective on the cancer has been so positive because she’s familiar with health crises. They have often coincided with career highs, serving as a tap on the shoulder, or punch in the stomach, to remind her not to take anything for granted. “Honestly, I feel life goes, ‘You having a good time? Sit down.’ Ever since I was a child, it has always gone alongside moments of success for me; something severe or obscure has happened to my health.”View image in fullscreen‘My mum and dad did a great job of making sure my character wasn’t defined by my worst days.’ Top: PatouShe takes me back to her 11-year-old self, already making her debut starring in the West End in Whistle Down the Wind (she was cast at the age of nine). That’s when she was diagnosed with the heart condition Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, which can cause a fast heartbeat as well as dizziness and palpitations. “I was going in and out of rehearsals on an IV drip, and going back into hospital at night.” She fast-forwards six years, and 17-year-old Jess has joined the girl group Soul Deep while attending the Brit School. “I just got my first record deal, and I had a stroke. Then when I was about to put out music in 2020 I had a car crash and my larynx moved up and I couldn’t sing for a year.”Oi, I say, slow down, I can’t keep up. You really had a stroke at 17? She nods. “I was on the train, and my face dropped. I felt awful and I went to the GP, and she said, ‘I think you’ve had a minor stroke, I’m going to call an ambulance.’ I was in hospital for four to five weeks.” She smiles. “I’ve clearly got an addiction to being diagnosed with things. So maybe the cancer is part of that.”Did illness define her childhood? Not at all, she says. “My mum and dad always did such a great job of not making that the definitive thing in my life, and not making me define my character by my worst days. That was amazing and has carried through to now.” Ultimately, she reckons her health issues have been the making of her. “They’ve made me live life more, eat better, work out more. Made me live in the moment.”I notice a tattooed open circle on her left wrist. What does that represent? “My mum, my dad and me got this on my dad’s 60th in New York. It’s a circle of love, and my sisters were too pussy to get it. So now I’m their favourite child!” She clearly adores her family. Cornish, aged 37, grew up in Essex with two older sisters who were more academic than her and were both head girls at secondary school. Their mother was a nursery school teacher; their father a mental health social worker.At 16, she started at the Brit School. Cornish was in the same year as Adele (with whom she sang in lunchtime sessions). In the past, she has said the Brit School was cut‑throat. What does she think students wanted more – to be good or to be famous? “I think people just wanted to be the centre of attention. We were all teenagers who wanted to be the loudest. Everything I wore was green and I’d draw music notes on my face and I was a hair model for Vidal Sassoon. So I literally looked like I was going to Star Trek school dressed as a duck.”Did she like the Brit School? “Ilovedit. You know what I loved the most? That it taught me how to be streetwise because I had to get five trains there every day to get from Essex to Croydon. I had to get up at the crack of dawn, so it gave me discipline. But I loved it. I loved learning, I loved it being different every day, loved not wearing uniform, the auditions. I would audition for everything. That’s how I got into the girl band that got me the first deal.”View image in fullscreen‘I love the success, but I don’t love being famous.’ Dress and shoes: Lanvin. Bangles: Dinosaur DesignsCornish first experienced success aged 21 as part of the team who wrote Party in the USA for Miley Cyrus in 2009. A year later, she had her first hit with Do It Like a Dude. The song was three minutes of promotional self-referencing (“Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey … J-J-J-J Jessie J”), female empowering, male parodying, double-entendre indulging (“Boys, you, you need to lick my dollar … Boys, g-getting hot under the collar”) poptastic filth. This was also her debut as Jessie J.Jessica, Jessie, Jess. I ask her which name she prefers. “Jess,” she says instantly. “I hate Jessie. It’s like a dog’s name. ‘Jessie, come back here!’” She whistles herself over, as if she were a dog. “The J makes it somehow nicer. It changes the whole thing.”Do It Like a Dude was followed by Price Tag, her first No 1 and still her most famous song. Price Tag is infectious bubble-gum pop about the primacy of happiness over money. But Cornish says it is also a critique of the industry she had barely entered. “It was about being a statistic and a number at a record label and it not being about talent or the truth.” She sings a line to illustrate her point, as she often does. “‘When the sale comes first and the truth comes second just stop for a minute and smile.’ I was already tired of contracts. I was so frustrated when I wrote that song. What you were trying to say wasn’t important, it was just about how much money can we make from this person.”There were many more hits including Domino (another UK No 1), Who You Are (a hymn to being true to yourself in the face of knockbacks, and one of her favourite songs), and 2014’s Bang Bang with Ariane Grande and Nicki Minaj (another celebration of female empowerment, and her biggest US hit). After Bang Bang there was one more Top 20 hit … and then it all ended. Single after single failed to chart. Cornish has not had a hit record for 10 years. She went from one of the hottest properties in pop to has-been overnight. How did it affect her? “You know what? I’m actually lucky in that I’ve never given a shit about No 1s or any of that stuff.Ever. It’s just not who I am. And that’s probably why I’ve had so many managers, because so many are like that.”In a way, she says, failure came as a relief. It allowed her to reclaim some of her anonymity. “I love the success, but I don’t love being famous. The hardest part of fame is losing the invisibility you have when you’re not successful that enables you to create the things that make you successful in the first place. So when I dropped off, I had a shaved head, nobody recognised me, I could go back to doing some normal shit.”But she also admits she lost belief in what she was doing. The successful songs from her last hit album Sweet Talker were written by other people and meant nothing to her. “I just retreated and said, ‘I can’t do this no more.’ I just kind of gave up. So I took a break and said, ‘I’m done with the industry.’”She went away and recorded the resolutely uncommercial album R.O.S.E. about “the struggle of finding my feet from the age of 25 to 30”. She loved it, but nobody bought it. “The label didn’t really support me because they didn’t get it. It wasn’t Bang Bang. But some of my favourite songs that I’ve written are on R.O.S.E.”It’s interesting that she says her early music stopped meaning anything to her.Last year, it was reported that she had made £7.6m in 2023, and there was speculation that she had done so by selling the rights to her music. Is that true? “No!!!” She laughs. But Cornish is a useless liar. She looks embarrassed. “I don’t know! Errr. I might have done.” She comes to a stop and, to the tune of Total Eclipse of the Heart, she sings: “Moving on to another question because I don’t know what to say to that one.” I was just curious, I say. “Music’s supposed to come and go,” she says. “Let it go. It’s like your wardrobe. You’ve got to have a little clearout now and again.”View image in fullscreen‘It was a selfish, amazing life I had in LA. Not the kind of life I could maintain with a child and a partner.’ Blazer and trousers: Rebecca Valance. Shoes: Gianvito Rossi. Necklace: Giovanni RaspiniWhile R.O.S.E. flopped commercially, in 2018 she enjoyed her most surprising success when sheentered the Chinese talent contest Singer. By then she was living in Los Angeles and was a distant memory for many of us in Britain. “My managers at the time said, ‘This TV show keeps coming in, and you’d be a special guest’, and I said, ‘Just say yes to it.’ They were, like, ‘D’you want to know more?’, and I was, like, ‘Nope, just sign me up, I need a shake-up.’ And that was it. I thought I was a special guest for three weeks, and I land in China and I’m a contestant on a competition and I didn’t even know. I sang Domino on the first show and won that, then I won the next and the next, and they were, like, ‘D’you want to stay on?’, and I was, like, ‘Well, yeah!’”The show was regularly watched by 500 million people. After 11 episodes, Cornish got to the final, which had an audience of 1.2 billion. She sang I Will Always Love You, and won the contest. It’s such a moving moment when she realises she’s won. A mix of shock, incomprehension (literally because it’s in Chinese) and euphoria. What did winning mean to her? “Oh!To be celebrated as a singer like that, I hadn’t had that before.” Does she think she should have been respected more as a singer? “No, but I always say the people who know I can sing wouldn’t buy my music and the people who buy my music probably don’t know I can sing that way.”Her new music seems incredibly personal. At times, it feels like the songs are private messages to all the people she’s been closest to throughout her adult life.Where does the album’s title come from? “I say ‘Don’t tease me with a good time’ all the time.” She explains it can be genuine, when somebody tempts her with a kind offer. But often it’s sarcastic. She gives me an example. “‘So do you want to have breast cancer surgery?’ ‘Don’t tease me with a good time!’”The song I Don’t Care ends with her monologuing: “So let’s raise a glass to us and to those still finding the courage to walk away from the gaslighters, the abusers, the narcissists.” Who are the gaslighters, abusers and narcissists? “They’re the men in my career and my life that have called me difficult because I’m a strong person who understands who I am.” They said that to your face? “Oh yeah, all the time. 100%.” Was this more in her personal or professional life? “More business. Maybe a couple of guys I dated, but nothing serious. I wouldn’t get serious with someone like that.”In the song Complicated, she summarises the first decade of her career. I quote her lines back at her. “2010 was the year I didn’t know what I was doing. I sang so loud. Insecure, but nobody knew it.” Yes, she says, well, she didn’t, and she did, and she was.In 2012, she sings, she broke up with “my beautiful girlfriend” and “With the press in my face, called it a phase, babe I’m sorry.” When Cornish became famous, she was dating a woman and said she was bisexual. After they split up, she said it was just a phase she was going through, which alienated LGBT+ fans. Thirteen years on, she’s making a public apology – not to members of the public who took offence, but to her ex. She says she worded it clumsily at the time. “It wasn’t me saying I’m not bisexual. I think I’m always going to be attracted to women. I’m so honest and open about it, but I don’t want a label on it, like ‘Jessie J the bisexual singer’.” Is Jessie still in touch with her ex? “No, not any more.” She sounds sad about it. Was she upset when she read that you had said was just a phase? Yeah, I’m sure it hurt her because our relationship was amazing and we were really serious. We lived together for a long time; around three years.”My American friends are scared. They’re not what Trump wants them to look like and be like and feel likeAnd so Complicated goes on. In 2014, she was told everyone hated her, in 2015 she was told she couldn’t have children, in 2016 and 2017 she grieved for herself, and in 2018 she “met a Magic Mike, will that ever be forgotten? Cos everything they write, that’s the headline, that’s the topic.” This is a reference to her then boyfriend Channing Tatum who starred in the Magic Mike films. “I played him the song to see if he’s OK with it and he was.” How does she get on with him now? “Oh, he’s so sweet. Oh my God, yeah! Channing is such a sweet guy. We were such good friends and had such a good time together.” In this relationship, he was the star and she was the plus one. She says it gave her a taste of what it must have been like for some of her former partners. “It did get frustrating. It felt that everything I read about myself was about him.”I tell her I think the song Threw It Away is about him, too. (“I gave you my love/ You threw it away.”) “Haha! That’s funny.” She starts singing it. “Yeah, I reckon there’s probably a little bit of that in there,” she concedes. “But it wasn’t just about him. I dated a lot of people when I was in LA and there were lots of men who were, like, ‘Yeah, ride on my motorbike and I’ll show you around’, and then they just drop you off. That’s the negative of LA.”She spent a decade there – her “solo” years. “It was a really selfish, amazing life I had. But it wasn’t the kind of life I could maintain with a child and a partner. When I had Sky I thought I didn’t want to raise my son away from his immediate family. And my partner’s Danish, so we wanted to be closer to Denmark, too.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m so proud of myself. I went full term. I had a C-section, which I didn’t want, but it didn’t matter.’ Coat: Victoria Beckham at Fenwick. Shoes: Guiseppe Zanotti. Necklace: MishoLast year, she moved back to Britain with her partner, the Danish-Israeli basketball player Chanan Colman, and Sky. “I just felt the new chapter was going to be here. It was the day that Trump got elected that I left. It was the day we planned to leave, so it felt aligned.” Did she want to be far away from him? “As far away as possible, please. I feel awful for the people who are still there. So many of my friends are struggling mentally with America right now. It actually scares me that I can’t even get into that mindset to try to understand what he does. It’s the polar opposite of what I believe in, which is equality and love and everybody having the freedom to enjoy the life they want to.” Does she think Trump is stopping them from living that life? “Of course he is, yeah. So many of my friends in America are scared because they’re not what he wants them to look like and be like and feel like.” And what is that? “Him!”Two of the songs on the album are about the death of loved ones. Comes in Waves addresses the baby she lost, with Cornish singing: “I hate how much I miss the future we never made.” In 2021, when she didn’t have a partner, she got pregnant by IVF, and miscarried after 10 weeks. Was it a tough decision to become a single mother? “No, I wanted to be a mum, and I wasn’t in a relationship. I had endometriosis and I’d done all these tests, and they said, ‘Your egg count is low and if you don’t get pregnant in the next year it’s highly unlikely that you will be able to conceive naturally.’ Obviously, that wasn’t true, because I did in the end.” The lyrics to Comes in Waves are so raw, Cornish wearing her vulnerability like gossamer armour. But it’s also a song of defiance that anticipates the birth of Sky, promising “Next time you come to me I’ll make a place for you to stay”. Again, she sings the line for me. “And I did. I fucking did it. I’m so proud of myself. I went full term. I had a C-section, which I didn’t want, but it didn’t matter.” Does she feel the baby she lost is still with her? “Always.Always. They say the DNA of a baby stays within you, so the bit of that DNA will be in Sky and in me for ever. But I do feel it didn’t happen because I wasn’t meant to do it on my own.”The song I’ll Never Know Why is equally painful. Here she berates herself for not seeing that an unnamed friend was “lost and hopeless”, and she asks him: “How could you say goodbye without saying goodbye?” In 2018, soon after she won Singer, her bodyguard and close friend Dave Last died unexpectedly. I ask her if this song is about him. She nods. Silence. Did he take his own life? Again, she nods, struggling for words. “I miss him so much, man. He was my guy for seven years. He was like my big brother. It makes me so sad that there was a loneliness there that meant it got to that before he would call me. I hope it’s a song that can help people who are left behind. And I also hope it helps people who are thinking of doing it to see a different perspective of what they would leave behind and how much they’re loved and wanted.”Cornish kept herself together while talking about her miscarriage and cancer, but now the tears come. “He was one of my favourite people in the world,” she says. When they were on tour, he was the first and last person she saw every day. “After every show we’d go for a walk and he’d always ask, ‘Have you got your hoodie?’ I’m performing the song at the Royal Variety Show and I’ll be wearing a hoodie.”She calls the album her journey through grief. Although it concludes on a positive note (with songs Living My Best Life and H.A.P.P.Y), it ends before the giddy high of having a baby with Colman. Cornish can’t wait to write about this on her next album. She says she’s never loved in the way she loves Colman. “Birthing someone’s child is so unique. It’s for ever engraved in our relationship because I’m looking at my son and it’s literally his and my face mashed together.

At points it feels like a literary tour by stealthJack SealeSat 29 Nov 2025 16.05 ESTShare‘Look at that!!” exclaims a jubilantSandi Toksvigat the very start of her jolly new travelogue, Great Riviera Rail Trip. “Marseille!” The city of Marseille is, undeniably, there behind her, it being the starting point for a four-episode trip east along the French south coast that will take in picturesque fishing villages, posh resorts and quirky nooks.Shows where we watch celebrities go on holiday come in many different stripes, but all boil down to us pressing our noses up against the screen and wishing we were there while the famous bod has a lovely time. The most honest course of action for the famous person is to lean into it and enthuse. Toksvig does this, constantly wriggling and giggling with pleasure as she tells us how incredible, magnificent, wonderful and beautiful the Riviera is. It looks as if she is right.Her first stop is Sanary-sur-Mer, where she experiences that harbinger of a well-planned sojourn: the view from her hotel window – of a delightful harbour giving way to the gently brilliant sea. It’s what she had imagined and hoped it would be, but slightly more enchanting. Off she trots, down to the waterside for the first of many meetings with interesting locals where language will be no bar to conviviality.“How nice to mityeuu,” says Toksvig, veering towards the vowels of Inspector Clouseau as she encounters the man who maintainsles pointus, the local wooden boats so called because they are pointy. Their subsequent conversation falters a little because of his limited English and her much scanter French, but the azure waters are too pretty for them or us to care.Back on land, Toksvig announces that she “feels a new novel coming on” before landing the first big laugh of the series: “Hello!” she bellows from her hotel balcony, to nobody in particular. “I’m a writer! Thank you!” Soon we’re learning about how Aldous Huxley, Bertolt Brecht, Thomas Mann and other writers found refuge here in the 1930s, the Germans having escaped Nazi persecution. Toksvig boggles giddily at the thought of Brecht, sitting perhaps in the very spot where she’s now enjoying some cafe culture, knocking out a satirical song about Hitler for the amusement of fellow coffee-sippers.When a subsequent visit to Hyères revolves around a visit to the chateau and gardens established between the wars by Edith Wharton, author of The Age of Innocence and The House of Mirth, it becomes clear that Toksvig might have slyly mis-sold her series to lure as many punters as possible: yes, she does travel by train but this is really Sandi Toksvig’s Great Literary Riviera Trip, a pleasant fantasy for bibliophiles. Having met and befriended the American arts and travel writer Lanie Goodman at the obligatory cafecharmant, the prospect of arriving chez Wharton causes another eruption of joy that’s at least half sincere: “This is one of the best days of my life! Let’s take our ice-creams with us!”As one wonders whether Toksvig’s adorably retro suitcase is secretly full of books – “I didn’t bring a lot of things, because I have a theory that France has got shops” – her recitation of a Wharton poem rounds off what, for the bookish traveller, looks like a perfect day that a good chunk of viewers will be desperate to emulate.The theme of literary sophistication is, however, lightly worn, and doesn’t extend to Toksvig’s narration, which is not immune to repetition and cliche. Sanary-sur-Mer in the 1930s was “the beating heart of European intellectual life”, while a few decades later, Saint-Tropez was “the beating heart of 1960s Bohemian life”. Bouillabaisse, meanwhile, is “the region’s most iconic dish”, although if you’ve decided to play the celebrity-documentary drinking game where you take a shot every time the presenter drops the i-bomb, that’s your only tot in episode one.Beyond Hyères is the famous Saint-Tropez, where an exclusive beach club was once graced by the presences of Allen Ginsberg, Marlon Brando and Brigitte Bardot. The town generally, though, causes the programme to lose its artsy energy and slide into the sort of scenes any lighthearted travelogue would pump out. A game of boules with some extremely French-looking men doesn’t throw up any memorable insight or conversation, nor does Toksvig’s solo sampling of the brioche-and-buttercream tarte tropézienne. Just when it seems there’s nobody around who is willing or able to chat productively, the situation is salvaged by a couple from Bradford who are on holiday and profess to be QI fans – Toksvig hits them with a QI-worthy story about how Saint-Tropez was named after a headless knight, and all is well again.Leg one of the journey ends at a hilltop vineyard, where the owners don’t have much to say but the organic rosé, its flavour freshened by the warm salt breeze, looks divine. It’s something to write home about.Sandi’s Great Riviera Trip is on Channel 4.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewSandi ToksvigreviewsShareReuse this content"

Time to get up to speed before this singer next hits the headlinesElle HuntSat 29 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 29 Nov 2025 00.02 ESTShareDo you ever feel like a plastic bag, drifting through the wind, wanting to start again? No? Just Katy Perry then. Seven months since her sense-defying jaunt into space, life on planet Earth hasn’t let up for the embattled hitmaker. She’s back in the headlines this week, implied to be raiding the pockets of a “disabled veteran” while facing scrutiny for her somewhat inexplicable new romance withJustin Trudeau. Yes, that Justin Trudeau. Shall we?1.Perry wins in court, but loses onlineBy one metric, such as “relative to the rest of 2025”, this might have been a good week for Katy Perry. Since 2020, she has been embroiled in a legal battle against Carl Westcott, who sold her an eight-bedroom, 11-bathroom mansion in Montecito for $15m. Westcott then attempted to renege on the deal, claiming to have been incapacitated by painkillers (prescribed after a back operation) when signing the paperwork. A judge ruled in Perry’s favour in May last year, finding that Westcott was sound of mind when the sale went through. This week, another judge ruled that Perry was owed $1.8m in damages. This sounds like a win, you might think –exceptPerry had pushed for Westcott to pay $4.7m,andit’s been widely written up as Perry money-grubbing from an“85-year-old disabled veteran”. To givemilitary.com’s headline, from earlier in the dispute in 2023: “Katy Perry Is Fighting a Dying, Elderly Veteran to Force Him to Sell His Home.” It is true that Westcott served in the 101st Airborne Division, is 85 years old and seriously ill with incurable Huntington’s disease. But the insistent framing may say more about Perry’s unenviable position as pop culture’s preferred punching bag.View image in fullscreenPerry told fans she’ll ‘keep looking to the light’ during a challenging year.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Kevin MazurGetty Images for iHeartRadioSide note: you may recall that this is not Perry’s first long-running legal dispute with an elderly person over property. In 2015, she was thwarted in her attempt to buy a former convent in Los Angeles by its former residents, who were reportedly unmoved by her attempt to win them over by showing them the Jesus tattoo on her wrist and singing a hymn. Sister Rita Callanan, 77, toldthe LA Times: “I found her videos … I wasn’t happy with any of it.” In 2018, another nun locked in the legal battle against Perrycollapsed and diedduring a court hearing.2. TheBlue Originspace-flight saga continues to burn bright …View image in fullscreenPerry kissing the ground upon her return to Earth.Photograph: Blue Origin/AFP/Getty ImagesAs of this year, Perry risks being remembered primarily for her participation in the all-female Blue Origin flight, widely criticised as a small step for women and a giant leap in idiocy for humankind. Perry spent 11 minutes in space; seven months later, she is still copping flak for being not only the junket’s highest-profile passenger but also its hammiest. She sang What a Wonderful World in space, broadcast a print-out of her tour setlist to the onboard camera, and extravagantly fell to her knees to kiss the ground upon her return. On Thursday Perry’s fellow space cadet, Gayle King,took some responsibilityfor Perry’s suborbital shenanigans, telling Ruthie’s Table 4 podcast that she only sang after pressure from her fellow passengers. On their descent, as they broke through the Earth-space boundary, “we said to Katy Perry, ‘Are you gonna sing Roar? Are you gonna sing Firework?’” King said. Per King’s account, Perry responded: “Shut the bleep up. I’m not going to sing a song. And if I was, I’m not going to sing any of my own freaking songs.” Perry landed on the Louis Armstrong classic just as the rocket broke through the Earth’s planetary bounds. “It was just so special,” said King. King justified her own participation on Blue Origin as part of her new year’s resolution to “open [herself] up to new adventures”. She had meant with regard to dating, King added, but going to space was good too.3. … though some doubt that it happened at allWhile the rest of us struggled to make sense of the Blue Origin saga, some independent thinkers claimed to have figured it out: the girlboss mission to space was in fact a cover-up to convince us that the Earth isn’t flat. Theconspiracy theory was taken upwhen some online footage showed the door to the spaceship being opened from the inside, moments before Amazon founder Jeff Bezos opened it from the outside. For some, this was proof enough that theentire trip was staged. Regrettably: it happened.4.Perry has been brought crashing back down to EarthTwo weeks after Perry’s not-so-triumphant return to terra firma, a group of her fans (or KatyCats, as they self-identify) clubbed together to show their support for the beleaguered star, paying for a digital billboard in New York’s Times Square to broadcast, for 24 hours, their “boundless, unwavering and eternal” love. Responding to the gesture on Instagram, Perryadmitted to being“battered and bruised” by the Blue Origin backlash and online efforts to turn her into a “human piñata”, but nonetheless determined to “keep looking to the light”. But Perry’s decision (as stated on Instagram) to remove “perfect” from her vocabulary proved grimly prophetic, with her Lifetimes tour (as advertised in space) receivingmixed reviewsand yet more online ridicule.View image in fullscreen‘Mixed reviews’ … performing on the Lifetimes tour in Mexico City.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Katy Perry5. Love no longer BloomsIn July, Perryconfirmed her splitfrom the actor Orlando Bloom, her fiance of six years, with whom she shares a five-year-old daughter Daisy Dove. The Blue Origin flight was reportedly a source of contention between the couple, with Bloomallegedly saying itwas “embarrassing”, “cringeworthy” and “looked ridiculous” during an argument. In the immediate aftermath of the split, Bloom sought solace in the wisdom of Jung, according to a spate of quotes postedto Instagram. A few months later, at Halloween, a photo of him posing with a woman dressed up as Perry on the Blue Origin flight went viral (though online speculation that she was his new girlfriendwas quickly disproved).6. A romance too good to be Trudeau?View image in fullscreenJustin Trudeau … ‘They are both smart and love to talk about serious issues.’Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesAn assumed silver lining of Perry’s 2025 has been her reportedly finding love – with none other than the former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau (who separated from Sophie Grégoire, his wife of 18 years,in August 2023). The pair were spotted together during an apparent dinner date in Montrealin late July, then Trudeau was spotted at Perry’s concert. But the mindboggling match didn’t receive much coverage. More than three months later, however, Perry and Trudeau seem to be a genuine item. In October, they were photographed together on Perry’s luxury yacht in California, locked inwhat might fairly be describedas “a steamy embrace”. Even the Daily Mail didn’t seem quite able to believe it,reporting on the“eye-popping pictures” and “roaming hands”. But a source was eager to quell any suggestion that the attraction might be purely physical,informing People magazine: “they are both smart and love to talk about serious issues … The romance has merit”. Later, Perry and Trudeaumade their first public appearancetogether, photographed hand-in-hand outside the Crazy Horse cabaret in Paris after Perry’s 41st birthday celebrations.Two weeks ago, Grégoire alluded to her ex’s high-profile new romance,telling a podcast: “We’re all human beings and stuff affects us.” Well, sure. Grégoire continued along the high road, saying that she chose “to listen to the music instead of the noise” – but it’s safe to assume she’ll be skipping Teenage Dream.Explore more on these topicsKaty PerryCelebrity crib sheetCelebrityJustin TrudeaufeaturesShareReuse this content"

My husband had become controlling, first with money, then with almost everything else: what I wore, who I saw, what I said. It crept up so slowly that I didn’t quite realise what was happening.We had met as students in the early 1970s, both from working-class, northern families and feeling slightly out of place at a university full of public school accents. We shared politics, music and a sense of being outsiders together. For years, life felt full of promise. When our first child arrived, I gave up my local government job to stay at home. That’s when the balance between us shifted.Because he earned the money, he began to see himself as the decision-maker. By the time we had our second son, what began as discussions turned into edicts. I remember once saying that one of the boys needed new shoes and him replying that we couldn’t afford them, only for him to spend the same amount on something for himself. Those small humiliations chipped away at my confidence until I barely recognised myself. I felt isolated, but I told myself it would be worse for the children if I left.My cultural awakening: The Big Lebowski inspired me to embrace unemploymentRead moreThen one evening, about 15 years into our relationship, a friend suggested we go to the cinema. It felt like a rare escape. The film was Thelma & Louise, which everyone was talking about. As soon as it started, I recognised Thelma’s husband – the blustering, bullying man who treats her like property. When Louise turned to Thelma and said: “You get what you settle for,” I felt it like a punch to the chest.That line lodged itself in my head. For months afterwards, it echoed through my thoughts as I went through the motions at home. I told myself I was staying for the boys, but it dawned on me that if I made myself ill and depressed with unhappiness, as I was doing, I’d be no good to them anyway.A year or so later, just before Christmas, I’d been out shopping with a neighbour when her car broke down. We were late getting home. I had phoned to explain, but when I walked through the door he launched into a furious tirade. I remember standing there, still holding my coat, and that line coming screaming back. Suddenly, I heard someone say, “That’s it, I’m leaving.” It took a moment to realise the voice was mine.By the end of the following week, I’d found a basement flat through a small ad in the local paper. I left with just a suitcase and my younger son – my husband had emotionally blackmailed our older boy to stay with him, something that still hurts to remember. I had no money, no family nearby, and no real plan beyond survival.I recognised Thelma’s husband – the blustering, bullying man who treats her like propertyWithin days of leaving, though, I felt a lightness I hadn’t known for years. I remember bumping into a friend I hadn’t seen for a while, who said: “What’s happened? You look incredible.” I was struggling in every material sense, but for the first time in decades, I could breathe. I began to see my friends a lot more, and poured my love into those relationships – something my husband hadn’t allowed me to do.A few years later I was diagnosed with breast cancer. By then, the boys were older and wonderfully supportive. It was a horrible time, but I remember thinking: “Thank God I’m not still married to him.” That thought was vindication.After 20 years on my own, and in my mid-60s, I moved back up north, closer to my roots. I got involved in community arts work, I met a widower with a love of art, too. I hadn’t been looking for love – after my first marriage, I was very wary of meeting someone else – but something about him felt different. It was just lovely and safe. We married three years ago, in a small, happy celebration surrounded by friends and family.Looking back, I sometimes think of that night at the cinema as the hinge on which my life turned. I will always be grateful to Thelma & Louise, and the friend who took me to see it. That single line – “You get what you settle for” – changed everything.In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women’s Aid.

In between we headed the two miles outside the city to the statues.

Tooth notes that it was blowing the sand around, and possibly also this dog. “I was taking a closeup of one of the sculptures when, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a small white dog bounding towards me,” he says. “I was amazed that an iPhone (and I) could freeze the dog in mid-air.”Tooth, who was the Guardian’s head of photography for many years until he retired, adds that he doesn’t normally title his photos, but did caption this one Snowy, “because the dog reminded me of Tintin’s. When I saw what I’d captured I felt a Muybridge-like joy – I had proved that all four of a dog’s legs leave the ground when running!”Explore more on these topicsPhotographySmart shotAntony GormleyArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While he whispered his innermost thoughts to his reflection as though scrutinising his own soul, the stillness in the Festspielhaus was breathtaking.It was one of the greatcoups de théâtreof the iconoclastic directorPatrice Chéreau, and McIntyre carried it off with aplomb. With his leonine physique, commanding stage presence and renowned abilities as a singer-actor, he was able to realise Chéreau’s concept of Wotan as a fallible, compromised worldly ruler rather than a supernatural being worthy of glorification.That production was subsequently recorded and released on DVD, as well as being broadcast on television in both Britain and the US in single-act instalments, bringing the work to unprecedentedly widespread attention. It also marked the crowning point of the career of McIntyre, who has died aged 91. His first Wotan had been at Scheveningen in The Hague in a production where his waist-length hair made him look, he recalled, “like a cross between Jesus and Batman”.Then followed performances at Covent Garden in Das Rheingold and Die Walküre (1970), a single Walküre at Bayreuth in 1971 and a Wanderer (in Siegfried) in 1972.Finally he was invited to undertake the whole cycle at Bayreuth in 1973, in the production byWolfgang Wagner, as well as the new Ring byGötz Friedrichat Covent Garden (1974) and made his debut at the Metropolitan, New York, as Wotan in Rheingold (1975).View image in fullscreenDonald McIntyre as Wotan and Gwyneth Jones as Brünnhilde in Wagner’s Die Walküre at Covent Garden, London, 1978.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyBy the time of thecentenary Ring at Bayreuthin 1976, therefore, he had had the opportunity to hone his already considerable technical and interpretativecommand of the role. His first appearance at Bayreuth had in fact been as Telramund in 1967, followed by the Dutchman (1969), Klingsor (1970), Amfortas and Kurwenal (both 1974). For over 20 years he sang there regularly, making his final appearance, as Amfortas, in 1988. He himself believed his finest role was that of Hans Sachs, which he sang in Zurich, London, Sydney and Wellington.In 2003, at the age of 68, he made a remarkable comeback as Alberich in Götterdämmerung at the Perth international arts festival, conducted by Lionel Friend, incarnating the avaricious dwarf, as he appears in a dream to his son Hagen, to chilling effect. Even more remarkably he appeared again in an all-star cast forChéreau’s Elektra (Aix-en-Provence, 2013; Milan, 2014; Berlin, 2016), uttering his six words of text with undimmed dramatic conviction.While Wagner was his speciality, McIntyre excelled also in Strauss (as Barak in Die Frau ohne Schatten and Jochanaan in Salome), as Pizarro in Fidelio, Scarpia in Tosca, Golaud in Pelléas et Mélisande and in the title roles of Rigoletto and Wozzeck.He was born in Auckland,New Zealand, the son of George and Hermyn McIntyre. His mother was musical and encouraged his early promise of musical talent. In his teens, however, he also excelled at sport, especially rugby, to the extent that he was considered for selection by the All Blacks.After leaving Mount Albert grammar school, McIntyre trained to be a teacher at Auckland Teachers’ Training College, but finally took up vocal study, first in Auckland with Hubert Milverton-Carva, then at the Guildhall School of Music in London. He had originally intended to study in Vienna, but in London he met his future wife, Jill Redington, prompting him to remain; they married in 1961 and went on to have three daughters.He made his debut in 1959 as Zaccaria in Nabucco with the Welsh NationalOpera, then joined the Sadler’s Wells company where, between 1960 and 1967, he undertook more than 30 roles, including Mozart’s Figaro, Caspar in Der Freischütz and Pennybank Bill in the first British staging of Mahagonny (1963). He made his Covent Garden debut in 1967 as Pizarro and subsequently appeared many times there and at other major houses such as Vienna, Munich, Berlin, Chicago, La Scala and Paris.Contemporary roles in which he appeared included Axel Heyst in Richard Rodney Bennett’s Victory (1970) and Prospero in Berio’s Un Re in Ascolto (British premiere, Covent Garden, 1989, followed by Opéra Bastille, 1991).He had to work hard at his languages, and in his autobiography The Only Way Is Up: Reflections on a Life in Opera (2019) made generous mention of his coaches in foreign languages, including Hilde Beal for German, and Norman Feasey and Janine Reiss for French. During his time at Sadler’s Wells, too, he was indebted to the director Glen Byam Shaw, who helped him “get my words across without having to worry about foreign languages”. Byam Shaw also taught him how to act, standing him in good stead for the rest of his career. McIntyre also acknowledged the huge role in his Wagner successes played by Reginald Goodall with his meticulous coaching undertaken in the upper-floor room at Covent Garden known as Valhalla.This conscientious attention to detail paid handsome dividends: his care for the meaning and articulation of the text, as well as vocal colouring and character psychology, ensured that his delivery was always vividly expressive. In person, too, he was ebullient and gregarious, keen to find the humour in any situation.Appointed OBE in 1977 and CBE in 1985, he was knighted in 1992.His first marriage ended in divorce. In 2014 he married Bettina Jablonski, and she survives him, along with his daughters.Donald Conroy McIntyre, opera singer, born 22 October 1934; died 13 November 2025Explore more on these topicsOperaNew ZealandobituariesShareReuse this content"

The newly minted version is a swish affair, with a copper-topped bar, distressed wood panels, local craft beers, tacos and a handsome crew of young locals in branded T-shirts. A lot of money has clearly been spent on the refurb, and it seems to be at the forefront of a new wave of developments in the historic village of Llanberis.When Pete Norton and his wife Victoria opened a cafe here in 1978, they envisioned a refuge for climbers, hillwalkers and anyone else who was hungry after a day out on the hills of Eryri. Rain-lashed visitors stumbling in from a long hike could look forward to pint mugs of tea poured from a metal teapot the size of a rhino’s skull, huge plates of steaming chilli and vegetable curry on brown rice, an all-day breakfast or mountainous chip butties.View image in fullscreenThe walls were adorned with black-and-white photos of local crags featuring the UK’s wildest climbers of the day: Andy Pollitt on Lord of the Flies at Dinas Cromlech; Al Harris looking louche on the precipitous cliffs of A Dream of White Horses on Gogarth;John Redheadon the Rainbow Slab in the Dinorwic slate quarries.In the 1980s, Llanberis Pass drew the best climbers from all over the world, and Pete’s Eats was the greasy-spoon temple that welcomed them all. I misspent much of my youth huddled in the window seats next to the jukebox, which rattled out the Kinks’ Sunny Afternoon in counterpoint to the rain hammering at the windows. Every so often wild-eyed, sinewy figures would stumble through the door in a cloud of chalk dust and request the Route Book – the mythical ledger of new climbs where local rock stars would map out and christen their latest conquests.View image in fullscreenLlanberis sits on the banks of Llyn Padarn and at the foot of Yr Wyddfa (Mount Snowdon) in north Wales.Photograph: Alan Novelli/AlamyPete’s Eats came under new ownership in 2018, struggled after the Covid 19 lockdowns and closed for renovations in September 2022. It showed no sign of reopening – a sad sight in a village where it occupies a central position.But in 2024, local entrepreneur Nick Pritchard stepped in to save Pete’s. “We had to do something. I love Llanberis and I’ve watched it struggle year by year because visitors bypassed the village as there was so little on offer in terms of food and drink,” he says. The cafe reopened in July.In the 1980s, Llanberis Pass drew the world’s best climbers, and Pete’s Eats was the greasy-spoon temple that welcomed them allWhile you can still buy the pints of tea that were a trademark of the original Pete’s Eats, the menu also now features cosmopolitan cafe fare such as smashed avocado and eggs benedict alongside the full Welsh breakfast. The staff bring a lot of energy to the place, and you get the feeling there’s a palpable will to make this a success, to make it their own. It’s setting a standard just by existing, especially at a time when local pubs, including the ones left in the village, are still recovering from the aftershock of lockdown.The post office has long since closed as has the much-loved Morris Bros bakery. ThePadarn Hotelbar was the night-time mirror of Pete’s Eats – when the cafe switched off its lights of an evening everyone meandered down the high street and into the Pad. On a Friday and Saturday night you could barely move. The Pad is still popular with tourists, but the riotous Saturday nights have now switched to the village-owned social club Yr Ddraig, a hugely successful bar and venue that regularly hosts live Welsh-language bands, drag acts and Elvis impersonators.View image in fullscreenFuel for hikers and climbers at the new Pete’s Eats.Photograph: Ceri BelshawThe turning point for villages like Llanberis came when holidaymakers who once flocked to Greece, Spain or the Canary Islands began to lean into the idea of a post-Covid staycation. Soon, the usual array of hillwalkers and outdoor enthusiasts were joined by a phalanx of Instagram explorers seeking out mythical backdrops to boost their posts. Almost overnight, social media sent local tourism into hyperspace.Eryri is one of the most Instagram-friendly national parks due to the incredible diversity in a relatively small region. It’s also one of the most filmic: Willow (1988) and Clash of the Titans (2010) were partly filmed here. Then there was the 2019 TV series The Witcher, and for two months this year whole sections of Dinorwig quarry were sealed off when an HBO crew set up camp to film the third season of House of the Dragon.Visitors flock here to try to find a secret waterfall, a primordial cascade surrounded by ferns that’s pure TolkienDinorwig quarryhas been a world heritage site since 2021, a testament to the men who worked and often died there extracting 500-million-year-old slate. There are dedicated viewing points, but the fences that were erected to keep people away from the treacherous holes and pathways have been cut.Visitors flock here to try to find a secret waterfall, a primordial cascade surrounded by ferns that’s pure Tolkien. Last Easter thousands of people swarmed here, with Wales Online blasting that“TikTok over-tourism leaves Gwynedd village besieged”.View image in fullscreenDinorwic slate quarry is one of the sites that make up the Unesco Slate Landscape of north-west Wales.Photograph: Peter Martin Rhind/AlamySlate may not sound like something that will get your teenage kids’ pulses racing, butthe National Slate Museumin Llanberis is an atmospheric place where you can almost feel the ghosts of quarrymen move around you, and an ongoing £21mrenovation of the attractionwill probably further boost tourism to the village.In keeping with Llanberis’s adrenaline-fuelled heritage, newer events such as theUltra-Trail Snowdonia, which started in 2018, have also helped boost visitor numbers. While the finishing touches were being added to Pete’s Eats in mid-June, the village hosted thousands of runners from across the globe competing in four mind-bogglingly hard mountain races that range in distance from 25K to 100 miles. The tagline for the race is “Beautiful beyond belief, savage beyond reason”.The tagline for the Ultra Trail Snowdonia race is ‘Beautiful beyond belief, savage beyond reason’Then in mid-July, the annualRas Yr Wyddfacelebrated its 50th iteration. The race to the summit of the mountain follows the Llanberis Path and back down again. It’s one of the busiest paths on the mountain and runners have to weave through hikers, dogs on extendable leads and selfie-taking groups of charity walkers in matching T-shirts. You win this race by ignoring the laws of physics and placing your faith in the mountain gods by sprinting downhill as fast as you can on ankle-shattering gradients that absolutely want to kill you.View image in fullscreenThe new look Pete’s EatsLike Pete’s, Ras Yr Wyddfa has become an institution. Managed and organised by local businesses and a team of dedicated volunteers, it attracts hundreds of athletes from around the world.The young team in Pete’s Eats has had a busy summer. When I mention to one of the staff that the place was so different back in the day, they nod wryly. “Lots of people have been telling us that. They can’t understand why we don’t have the same menu as before. But most people love it, and nowadays you can get a chilled glass of pinot grigio if you don’t fancy a pint of tea.”They’re right, the cafe has adapted, and the village is the better for it. Much as I loved the spit and sawdust of the old Pete’s, the climbers have changed, the tourists have changed, and I’m reliably informed by my daughter that kids don’t eat chip butties any more.Explore more on these topicsSnowdonia holidaysClimbing holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysWales holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The twice-baked comté soufflé, light and delicately cheesy, is a timeless favourite that’s simple to prepare yet sure to impress. It’s followed by a roast capon, the festive bird of choice in France, prized for its tender, delicious meat, and paired with chestnuts and pommes Anna. These classic recipes are not just reserved forChristmastables, but I think the combination captures the spirit of comfort and indulgence that defines traditional French gastronomy.Chapon rôti, chestnuts, pommes AnnaPrep5 minCook4 hr 50 minSetovernightServes8For the chapon1capon(3-3½kg), with liver and gizzard, or 1 extra-large chickenSalt and black pepper1 black truffle1 tbsp olive oil1½kg fresh chestnuts, or 450g peeled and cooked chestnuts50g butter2 celery sticks1.4 litres chicken stock50g chervil, or parsleyFor the pommes Anna300g butter, or 250g clarified butter or ghee, plus extra for brushing8 large floury potatoes, such as maris piper,Saltand black pepperThe day before, put the butter for the potatoes into a cold pan and slowly bring to a boil, skimming off the froth that comes to the top and leaving the milk solids to sink to the bottom. The clear butter you’re left with is what you want. Transfer the clarified butter to a large bowl.Line a flat-sided nonstick pan or oven dish with greaseproof paper and heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Peel and thinly slice the potatoes to about 1mm thick, ideally on a mandoline, adding the sliced potatoes to the butter bowl as you go. Season generously and mix to coat; the butter might start to set, so keep the bowl somewhere warm-ish; so long as each slice is coated with butter, hard or soft, you’ll be OK.Start layering the potatoes in the lined pan until it’s filled to the top, then cover with more paper and put a heavy pan on top to weigh down the potatoes. Bake for an hour and a half, then check – if a knife goes through the potatoes without resistance, they’re ready. Remove, leave to cool, then put in the fridge overnight to set.The next day, heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3. Remove the liver and gizzard from the capon, rinse the cavity and pat dry. Generously season the inside of the bird, then put the truffle in the cavity, along with the liver and gizzard. Truss the bird securely, then rub the skin all over with oil and season again.Put the capon breast-side up in a roasting pan and roast for about two and a half hours, basting several times.Meanwhile, use a small, sharp knife to slit open the rounded side of each chestnut shell. Drop them into a large pan of boiling salted water, cook for a few minutes, then drain and peel while they’re still warm; make sure you remove both the outer shell and thin inner skin.Melt the butter in a large skillet, add the peeled chestnuts, and stir gently with a wooden spoon to coat. Add the celery ribs, then pour in the stock, cover the pan and leave to simmer gently, without stirring, for 20 minutes. Drain, then remove and discardthe celery.Meanwhile, finish the pommes Anna. Turn out the potatoes on to a baking tray and cook in a 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 ovenfor 20–30 minutes, until golden and evenly crisp all over, brushing with more melted clarified butter to help things along.Five minutes before the capon is ready, add the chestnuts to the roasting pan so they can absorb some of the cooking juices. When the capon is cooked, take the pan out of the oven and transfer the bird to a warm platter. Arrange the chestnuts on a separate dish, and sprinkle them with the chopped chervil. Remove the truffle, liver and gizzards from the cavity of the bird., slice the truffle thinly and dice the liver and gizzards, then scatter all of them over the chestnuts.Transfer the pommes Anna to a platter, sprinkle with salt, then cut into wedges and serve. Carve the capon on a board, then arrange the slices neatly on the platter. Deglaze the roasting pan with 60ml water or stock, scraping up any browned bits, then simmer briefly. Pour the resulting sauce into a sauceboat and serve alongside the capon with the pommes Anna.Twice-bakedsoufflé au vieux comté,salade verteView image in fullscreenMatthew Ryle’s twice-baked comte soufflé, with a green salad.Not essential, but I think this soufflé is best when paired with a crisp green salad.Prep15 minCook1 hr 10 minServes4For the cheese base20g butter20g plain flour100g milkNutmeg,grated100g comté, gratedSalt and black pepper3 egg yolks40g double cream15g dijon mustardFor the leek sauce50g butter1 leek, washed and finely sliced1 garlic clove, peeled and finely grated200g double cream80g camembertFor the soufflésSoftened butter200gegg whiteLemon juice210g cheese base(see above)For the green salad30g dijon mustard30mlwhite-wine vinegar½ smallgarlic clove,grated on a Microplane180mlrapeseed oilJuice of ¼lemonLettuce leavesof your choice, washed, dried and left whole10gdiced shallot5gchopped chivesMelt the butter for the cheese base in a saucepan on a medium heat, then add the flour and cook for a few minutes. Whisk in the milk in stages, then bring to a boil, still whisking. Turn down the heat and simmer for two minutes.Grate in some nutmeg, then mix in the cheese and season. Transfer to a blender, and add the egg yolks one by one, blending until smooth after each addition. Add the cream and mustard, and blend briefly to combine. (If you are making a bigger batch, weigh the sauce into 210g bags, so they’re ready to go for a four-portion soufflé. Drop the bag into hot water to warm up when required.)The cheesy leek sauce can be made ahead of time, too. Melt the butter for the leek sauce in a saucepan on a low-medium heat, then saute the leek and garlic until completely soft but without colour. Add the cream and cheese, season, then leave to bubble for a couple of minutes.Rub four ramekins generously with softened butter and heat the oven to 170C (150C fan)/300F/gas 3½. Using an electric whisk or stand mixer, beat the egg whites and a few drops of lemon juice to stiff peaks. Add a third of the egg whites to the warm cheese base, beating to lighten the mix, then gently fold in the remaining egg whites.Spoon the soufflé mix into the buttered moulds and tap on a work surface to flatten the tops. Put in a bain-marie and bake for 12-16 minutes; if you are using larger moulds, it may take up to 20 minutes. Once cooked, the tops will be golden brown and the soufflés will visibly come away from the sides of the moulds with minimal wobble. Remove the soufflés, then turn up the oven to 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9.Make the dressing: whisk the mustard, vinegar and garlic in a bowl, then slowly beat in the oil. Season and add the lemon juice. Dress the leaves with plenty of dressing, add the diced shallots and toss with your hands until every leaf is evenly coated. Put in a large bowl and sprinkle with the chives.Turn out the cooked soufflés on to trays. They will now sit happily at room temperature, ready to be finished when you’re ready to eat. Pour the cheesy leek sauce over the soufflés and return to the oven for five minutes, untilgratinatedall over.Matthew Ryle is chef/partner atMaison FrançoisandCafe François, both in London.Explore more on these topicsFoodChristmasChristmas food and drinkChickenMeatNuts and seedsPotatoesrecipesShareReuse this content"

This means I no longer do feasts with lots of elements, even at Christmas, but I still adore a showstopper, especially one that the whole table, irrespective of dietary requirements, can enjoy together. This year’s offering is such a centrepiece, an aubergine timbale (timbale means drum) packed to the gunnels with vegetables, rice, nuts, fruit, spices and, should you wish it (you should), one of the finest cheeses to come out of Normandy: Boursin.Christmas aubergine and rice timbaleYou will need a 23cm springform cake tin and two or three large baking trays (or you might need to bake in batches). In advance, you can roast the aubergines and squash and cook everything up until the rice (ie, the onions and spices, etc). Also worth knowing: you can bring this out of the oven an hour before serving and it reheats well in the microwave. Both dairy and dairy-free Boursin are now available.Prep20 minCook1 hr 45 minRest15 minServes8Extra-virgin olive oilFine sea salt1.2kg aubergines(about 4 large ones), 3 cut lengthways into ½cm-thick slices, the other cut into 2cm x 2cm cubes500g butternut squash, peeled, deseeded and cut into 1cm x 3cm slices3 large onions, peeled and thinly sliced6 garlic cloves, peeled and minced20g sage, leaves picked, ⅔ of them chopped, the rest left whole½ tsp ground black pepper1¼ tsp ground cinnamon1½ tsp ground allspice100g tomato puree350g basmati rice, rinsed and soaked in cold water50g shelled walnuts, roughly chopped50g currants150gBoursin, or similar (a vegan one, if need be)Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 and line three large baking trays and a 23cm springform cake tin with baking paper. Put eight tablespoons of oil into a large bowl, add a teaspoon of salt, then mix well. Brush the oil over both sides of the aubergine slices, then lay them out on two of the trays, making sure they’re not overlapping.Put the cubed aubergine and squash in the oil bowl, mix well, then tip out on to the other tray. Roast all the vegetables for 25-35 minutes, until the sliced aubergines are bronzed.Meanwhile, put four tablespoons of oil in a wide frying pan for which you have a lid, then set it over a medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, until soft and golden. Add the garlic, chopped sage and spices, fry for five minutes, then add the tomato puree and cook, stirring, for another five minutes.Drain the rice and add it to the pan with one and a quarter teaspoons of salt and 450ml water. Mix well, cover and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a whisper and cook for seven minutes, until the rice is still a little undercooked.Tip the rice on to the tray with the cubed aubergine and pumpkin, sprinkle over the walnuts and currants, then dot with pieces of Boursin and mix gently.Arrange the aubergine slices over the base of the cake tin, overlapping them slightly and with no gaps, then work your way up the sides, leaving a couple of centimetres of sliced aubergine hanging up and over the edge of the tin.Spoon the rice mixture into the tin until it’s full, then cover the top with more overlapping aubergine slices. Fold in the overhanging bits to seal and enclose.Put a small square of baking paper on top of the aubergines, wrap the top tightly with foil, then bake for 30 minutes.Remove and leave to rest for 15 minutes before serving. Meanwhile, put a tablespoon of oil in a small saucepan on a medium heat and, when it’s very hot, add the whole sage leaves and fry until crisp. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried sage to a plate and sprinkle with sea salt.Unwrap the foil and paper from the tin and place a platter on top. Carefully but quickly flip over the plate and tin, undo the springform catch, then remove the tin.Voilà!Serve with the crisp sage leaves on top.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkMeera Sodha recipesFoodVegetablesCheeseVegetarian food and drinkRiceMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

Use your Isa allowanceThe £20,000 annual limit on payments into the tax-efficient accounts remains but from 6 April 2027, the rules on where the money can be put will change for anyone aged under 65. Instead of being able to put all of the money into a cash Isa, that element will be capped at £12,000. Anything you pay in above that will have to go into a stocks and shares Isa. If you are over 65, all £20,000 can still be put into a cash Isa.Isas: six steps to take before the April allowance deadlineRead moreIn the 16 months before the changes come in, you can exploit the existing allowances. There is no limit on what you can hold overall, and once money is in the Isa wrapper you will be able to move it around each year and earn interest without tax.There are some good rates available at the moment if you have not used up this year’s allowance.View image in fullscreenThe cash Isa savings allowance has been capped at £12,000, from £20,000 a year.Photograph: Leonora Oates/Alamy“If it makes sense to open a cash Isa, and you have the money and allowance available, it’s worth acting sooner rather than later, while there are still strong rates around,” says Sarah Coles of the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. This week, the online operator Trading 212 was offering a rate of 4.56% on an easy-access cash Isa, with Leeds building society and the Post Office offering 4.05%.Interest earned outside an Isa is subject to tax once you go over your personal savings allowance. It’s £1,000 for basic rate taxpayers, £500 for higher-rate payers and up to £5,000 if you earn less than £17,570 a year. That means that if you’re earning 4% on your savings, you can hold up to £25,000 before facing tax as a basic-rate payer, or £12,500 as a higher-rate payer.2. Switchshares to an IsaOne surprise in the budget was a rise in income tax on dividends, increasing the cost of owning income-producing shares. From April 2026, the ordinary rate will rise from 8.75% to 10.75%, while the upper rate goes from 33.75% to 35.75%. You will only pay this if you have used up your income tax personal allowance and the your annual dividend allowance (now at £500).Stocks and shares Isas: how to choose where to investRead moreIf you want to avoid the rise, you could switch your investments into an Isa as long as you have enough of your £20,000 allowance left to do so. The process, known as “Bed & Isa”, involves selling off the investments and then repurchasing them back within an Isa wrapper. If you have made big gains on them you may face capital gains tax (CGT) so it is worth taking advice. Any future growth and income from the investment will be protected from CGT and dividend tax.View image in fullscreenPutting shares which boast the highest, most regular dividends inside a stocks and shares Isa makes financial sense, says experts.Photograph: Tommy  (Louth)/AlamyColes says if the value of your shares is higher than the Isa allowance you have, you should prioritise those which generate the highest dividends. “This will leave more growth-oriented investments outside the tax wrappers. It may be subject to capital gains tax, but this can be deferred and managed through annual allowances,” she says.Jason Hollands of the wealth management firm Evelyn Partners says married couples have the option of using two sets of dividend allowances and twoIsas, by taking advantage of transfers between spouses.“This involves shifting investments and cash to a spouse. It does not give rise to a taxable event which it would in the case of unmarried couples,” he says.3. Reviewsalary sacrificeA well-flagged change in the budget was the weakened benefits for employees who pay part of their income into a pension via salary sacrifice. At present, workers and employers can avoid national insurance (NI) payments on sums sacrificed from gross pay. But from April 2029, payments above £2,000 a year will not benefit from an NI exemption.Rachel Reeves to cut tax benefits for workers using salary sacrifice schemes to buy bikesRead moreIf this affects you, there is almost three-and-a-half years to make any changes you need. A good place to start is with your employer – find out if the rules of your scheme are going to change after this budget.Look at your contributions and see whether, in the short term, increasing the amount you are paying in is possible in order toexploit the current savings.If you are keen to keep down your taxable earnings, it is also worth investigating what other salary sacrifice schemes your employer offer. This could be getting a bike through the Cycle to Work scheme or by leasing an electric vehicle.View image in fullscreenThere is almost three-and-a-half years until the chancellor’s salary sacrifice changes take effect.Photograph: Trevor Chriss/AlamyBut don’t panic. If your employer plans to still offer this as a way to pay into your pension, it remains a good option.“It’s easy to assume that continuing to increase your pension contributions is no longer valuable, but this is not necessarily true,” says Chris Britton of the human resources tech firmReward Gateway/Edenred.“Yes, your employer will be liable for increased NI for any contributions you make that exceed £2,000 a year, but bear in mind that all contributions to your pension, even above the £2,000 threshold, are exempt from income tax, and you’re still avoiding paying NI on any contributions up to £2,000.”‘Struggling to pay the bills’: Britons under pressure react to budget 2025Read more4.Give gifts while you canThere were some tweaks to inheritance tax (IHT) that will bring more people into the net; so for those who might be affected, the advice is simple: think about spending and giving away more money.IHT is a tax paid on someone’s assets after they die if they leave enough to go above a certain threshold. The thresholds at which IHT is payable were already frozen, and in her budget the chancellor extended the freeze for another year, until April 2031.The standard IHT rate is 40%, and it is charged only on the part of the estate that is above the tax-free threshold, which is £325,000. (There is a separate threshold for homes.)The exemption for spouses or civil partners will continue to apply, so everything can be left to them without an IHT bill.View image in fullscreenGifting sums is a good way to cut or avoid inheritance tax. There is even an allowance that lets you hand tax-free gifts to people getting married.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/AlamyThe extension of the current thresholds makes it all the more important to consider the value of your estate – especially as April 2027 will bring unspent pensions into the IHT net.One way to reduce the bill is to make financial gifts while you are still alive, althoughthe financial adviser RBC Brewin Dolphin says its recent survey found that 73% of well-off individuals had never done so. “Our advice … is to start the process of gifting as soon as possible,” it says.There are various allowances you can use to give tax-free gifts. For example, you can give away assets or cash worth up to £3,000 in a tax year without them being added to the value of your estate. And the small gift allowance lets you give as many gifts of up to £250 a person as you want each tax year (as long as you haven’t used another allowance on the same person). There is also an allowance that lets you give tax-free gifts to people getting married.Meanwhile, the “potentially exempt transfer” rules allow you to give money or gifts of any amount or value to anyone, which will become exempt from IHT as long as you live for seven years after giving them.5. Weigh up mansion taxThe new high-value council tax surcharge – the “mansion tax” – will hit owners of properties in England worth more than £2m. This charge will start at £2,500 a year, rising to £7,500 a year for homes worth more than £5m.‘I don’t live in a mansion. It’s a 1930s house’: Richmond residents react to council tax riseRead moreThe new tax (which will sit alongside council tax) will be based on property values in 2026 rather than now, and won’t take effect until 2028. The Treasury says fewer than 1% of properties in England are expected to be above the £2m threshold.The fact the new tax doesn’t come in until April 2028 has negatives and positives. On the downside, that is two-and-a-half years of uncertainty for owners of, and prospective buyers of, higher-value homes.View image in fullscreenThe new ‘mansion tax’ will start at £2,500 a year for homes worth £2m+, rising to £7,500 a year for homes worth more than £5m.Photograph: Jeff Gilbert/AlamyAnalysts at Morningstar say they are expecting a 5% to 10% “correction” (fall) in the prices of high-value properties, and some impact on homes a little below the £2m mark – which might at least alleviate the worries of some owners who are keen to stay put.On the plus side, those who might be affected have a lot of time to consider their options.Some owners will decide to ride it out and set some money aside to pay the tax, but the most obvious way to avoid it is to bring forward any plans to downsize. Moving home attracts lots of costs – not least stamp duty – so if avoiding the mansion tax is your only motive, you need to do your sums first.Stylish new homes in England for downsizers close to town – in picturesRead moreIt might not be as easy to move as you hope – the new tax means “you have to question who’s going to want to try to buy these properties”, says Chris Ball at the wealth management firm Hoxton Wealth.If you are approaching the £2m threshold you may want to keep a lid on the value of your property. The HomeOwners Alliance suggests many owners of £1m-plus homes will hold back on making improvements to avoid being pushed over the threshold in future years. So perhaps this will swing the balance against “non-essential” work such as getting the loft converted or a conservatory added.Explore more on these topicsMoneyConsumer affairsIsasSavingsBanks and building societiesStock marketsCapital gains taxfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On rare occasions they both go in on the same day. On this particular day, my wife and the dog are also out. I’m alone in the house.I’m lingering over lunch – because, why not? – when my phone pings in my pocket. It’s a text from my bank.“Your address has been updated,” it reads. “If you didn’t make this request … ”I think: I certainly didn’t.“ … please contact us urgently.” So much, I think, for lingering over lunch.I return to my office shed and locate the helpline number on the bank’s website. A robot asks me to speak my reason for calling aloud.“You told me to call you,” I say. This is not satisfactory. I am given a list of acceptable reasons. I say “No” to all of them. When I’ve exhausted this branch of inquiry, I’m asked to input a bunch of identifying numbers using the keypad. Once I’ve completed this, the bank hangs up on me.Gareth has clearly been given training in dealing with confused old people – he speaks very slowly, and treats everything I say with a blank earnestnessI ring the number again, rephrasing my reason for calling and speaking very slowly. I’m asked if, instead of hold music, I would prefer a soothing tone. I choose hold music, because I want to remain exactly as irritated as I am right now. I soon regret this choice. Eventually, a voice interrupts the song.“Can I take your full name, please?” she asks. I tell her.“And can you tell me the reason you’re calling today, please?” In clear and polite English I explain the thrust of the issue, which is: you asked me to contact you if I didn’t make this request.“And I didn’t,” I say. There is a long silence.“I’m just going to put you in touch with our … ” The next bit is garbled.“Sorry, I didn’t quite catch … ” I say.“ … who will be able to help you with whatever you need today,” she says.“OK, well, thank you, I’ll … ” Again loud music fills my left ear. After a few seconds, a recorded voice breaks in.“You’re being transferred to our 60+ customers maintenance team,” it says.“I’m what?” I say, to no one. The music stops.“Thank you for calling,” a voice says. “This is Gareth speaking.

Gareth has clearly been given special training in dealing with confused old people – he speaks very slowly, and treats everything I say with a kind of blank earnestness. I keep thinking: how did I end up here? What did I say that tipped them off?Gareth’s manner is deeply patronising, but difficult not to lean into. I find myself eager to test the limits of his patience. While he is taking my details again, I interrupt.“I have a theory, Gareth,” I say, knowing this is the last thing he wants to hear. But Gareth’s 60+ customers maintenance training has taught him not to react to my statement with an audible puff of exasperation – he just leaves a gap where it would have gone.“OK,” he says. “Please go on.”I explain: an online bank I’ve used for many years has recently closed, and my savings account has been migrated to a new bank – the bank of Gareth – where coincidentally I also have an account. The online bank probably had an old address for me, which has most likely been updated automatically, which in turn has triggered a text warning, which, in hindsight, I should have ignored.“Let me just check that for you,” he says. If my theory was meant to make me sound less befuddled, it hasn’t worked. Gareth’s tone has shifted to a new level of indulgent concern, as if he’s just trying to keep me on the line until the ambulance arrives.“Can you just confirm the balance on that savings account?” he says.“Absolutely no idea,” I say.By the time I hang up I feel totally enfeebled. And there is no one at home to complain to.Eventually, my wife arrives. I recount the whole story, but she laughs in all the wrong places.“You’re missing the point,” I say.“I don’t think I am,” she says, suppressing a smile.“The point is, how did they know?” I say. “What gave me away?”“Did they ask for your date of birth?” she says.“Yes,” I say, “but even then they put me through to the customer service for normal people, at least until I spoke.”I go back to my office, and sit in the gathering dark. This will seem funny later, I think. Nothing to do but wait.Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnBanks and building societiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A night-time skulk in the woodsPurwell Ninesprings, Hertfordshire:A chilly evening spent interpreting rustles and admiring the silhouetted trees – now that’s what I call a bargainNic WilsonSat 29 Nov 2025 00.30 ESTLast modified on Sat 29 Nov 2025 03.37 ESTShareIused to regard November as the D month. Dank. Dismal. Dreary. Depressing. That is, until I discovered the Dark. My conversion took place on Black Friday 2019, as I sat alone in a Bedfordshire wood under a sliver of moon.With eyes slowly acclimatising, I started to pick out night’s nuances – the pale suggestion of leaves underfoot, a glimmer of eyes? What surprised me, though, was the sound. Behind me, the woodland stream continued flowing as loudly and vigorously as by day, yet it seemed incongruous in the darkness, as if the water should be slowing and quietening, preparing to bed down for the night. The irrepressible gushing dispelled any anthropocentric notion that the natural world is a diminished place after dusk.Tonight I’m sitting in thealder carr– a wood more familiar to me than any other – three hours after nightfall. Here in the trees, all is black, but I know what’s out there: the bramble patch where wood mice forage for blackberry seeds, and the flap of black poplar bark under which treecreepers nested and, quite likely, roost.In the dead logs beside the path, water and nutrients are flowing through the hyphae ofscarlet elf cupfungus. Above my head, marcescent oak foliage is home to a host of wasp larvae, each encased in its own delicatesilk button gall. A rustling in the brambles sounds substantial enough for muntjac. The darkness around me feels inhabited, companionable.The little I can see is captivating too: leafless trees outlined against theskyglowfrom nearby Hitchin have the simple beauty of Victorian silhouettes. Alders sport tufty crowns on skinny trunks, hawthorn’s zigzag twigs twist in tangled chaos, and a single silver birch bows its fine branch tips with a careless elegance. Without the distraction of colour and texture, I can appreciate the growth habits of these common tree species and connect with them in a way that isn’t possible during the day.Embracing late November’s dark afternoons and evenings has become an annual ritual, a seasonal escape from whatDara McAnultyrecently described as the commodification of attention. For me, Black Friday is a reminder to stop, make my peace with the advancing darkness and open my mind to new ways of engaging with my local patch.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentCountry diaryRural affairsBirdsAnimalsWildlifeTrees and forestsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The government also said it demanded respect for its airspace and would not accept foreign orders or threats.Trump on Saturday, in a Truth Social post said: “To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.”Due to Trump’s announcement, all migrant deportation flights were “unilaterally suspended”, the Venezuelan government added. Deportation flights to Venezuela have been a significant point of contention for theTrump administration, as it continues to engage in its mass deportation program.The US defense department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.US strikes against alleged drug boats in theCaribbeanhave been under way for months, along with a US military buildup in the region, and Trump has authorized covert CIA operations in Venezuela.The president told military service members this week that the US would “very soon”begin land operationsto stop suspected Venezuelan drug traffickers.Last week, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned major airlines of a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over Venezuela due to a “worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around” the South American country.Venezuelarevoked operating rightsfor six major international airlines that had suspended flights to the country after the FAA warning.The Trump administration has accused the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, of involvement in drug trafficking, a charge he has denied.Maduro, in power since 2013, has said that Trump is seeking to oust him and that Venezuelan citizens and the military will resist any such attempt.US forces in the region have so far focused on counter-narcotics operations, although the assembled firepower far outweighs anything needed for them.They have carried out at least 21 strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific since September, killing at least 83 people.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaDonald TrumpTrump administrationCaribbeanUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The White House said – without proof – that the people in the boats in the Caribbean, killed in Pentagon operations, were drug smugglers.Following the Washington Post’s reporting, two senators – Republican Roger Wicker and Democrat Jack Reed – released a statement saying the Senate armed services committee would be investigating the boat strikes.“The Committee is aware of recent news reports – and the Department of Defense’s initial response – regarding alleged follow-on strikes on suspected narcotics vessels in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,” the senators wrote in a joint statement.“The Committee has directed inquires to the Department, and we will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to the circumstances.”During the 2 September operation, led by the elite counter-terrorist group Seal Team 6, a first missile strike left two survivors clinging on to the wreck, the Post reported. Adm Frank M “Mitch” Bradley, head of Special Operations Command, reportedly ordered a second strike to kill the two survivors to comply with Hegseth’s orders.Some current and former US officials and experts have said, according to the Post, that the Trump administration’s missile strikes in the Caribbean may be unlawful. To date, more than 80 people have been killed in the series of military strikes, targeting at least 22 more boats.Historically, the US government has interdicted drug-trafficking boats in the water and prosecuted the alleged smugglers.The Trump administration has accused all people on the boats in theCaribbeanof being drug traffickers, saying they were primarily members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang that has been a major focus of the administration. Most of the boats have departed from Venezuela, where US government political pressure continues to mount.“The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people,” Hegseth said in a social mediaposton Friday evening. “Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.”Earlier this year, the Trump administration designated Tren de Aragua as a terrorist organization. The administration has also accused the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, of being the head of the Cartel de los Soles, a purported drug-trafficking organization made up of top Venezuelan government and military officials. Although the administration has also declared the Cartel de los Soles to be a terrorist organization, organized crime expertssaythe group is a loose network of lower-ranking military officials without a strict hierarchical structure.Trump has said that the US is attacking the boats due to high rates of fentanyl-related overdose deaths. But lawmakers, narcotics experts and former law enforcement officials have rejected that claim, since fentanyl does not come fromVenezuela.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It details of the lives of a number of men who were killed, revealing that although some of the men were indeed running drugs, they were ‘“not narco-terrorists or leaders of a cartel or gang”.Venezuelan officials, and some other nations, have denounced the administration’s strikes in the Caribbean, saying they are a violation of due process. The Venezuelan ambassador to the UN called the attacks “extrajudicial executions”.The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that the alleged traffickers pose a direct threat to the US, leading them to say they are in “armed conflict” with the groups.The Guardian reportedthis week that the Trump administration is framing the strikes as a self-defense effort on behalf of US allies in the region. Throughout the course of the strikes, there have only been a few survivors, including an Ecuadorian man and a Colombian man, who were captured by the USthen returnedto their home countries.One boat strike in October, off the Pacific coast of Mexico, led the Mexican navy to begin asearch-and-rescue operationfor survivors.Internally, Department of Defense officials have been quietly raising concern about the boat strikes. A senior military lawyer disagreed with the Trump administration that the strikes are lawful and was later sidelined by other officials, NBCreported. And Adm Alvin Holsey, the commander overseeing the attacks against boat strikes, stepped down in October. Although the reason behind Holsey’s departure is unknown, the New York Timesreportedhe had raised internal concerns about the attacks on the boats.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

And once the tourists had come back, it kind of fell away from the public eye. And there was a sense as well that it was essentially a short-term project.“People need to understand the gravity of the situation. And that it’s going to take a long time and a lot of resources to [rebuild] Black River and [other affected] districts,” she said.The Windrush activist Euen Herbert-Small said the UK should offer humanitarian protection similar to that given to Ukrainians affected by war, which allowed Ukraine nationals and their immediate family members to come to the UK under theHomes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme.“Jamaica is a Commonwealth country. The king is head of state. Ukraine doesn’t have those same historical and present links. And so there is a greater responsibility to support Jamaica, which has strong historical ties with this country and has made this country wealthy over the years. We did it for Ukraine. We can definitely do it for Jamaica,” said Herbert-Small, who has launcheda petition calling for humanitarian visasfor Jamaicans affected by Melissa.0:58Before-and-after views show Hurricane Melissa damage to Jamaican town – videoRosalea Hamilton, the chief executive of the nonprofitLasco Chin foundation, which has been assisting hurricane-hit communities in Jamaica, echoed Herbert-Small’s sentiments, as she described the staggering need for support on the ground.“The king is our head of state and there is an expectation on the part of ordinary Jamaicans that … it ought to mean that in a time of crisis, there is at least some kind of a special consideration or something that would flow from the fact that he’s still head of state,” she said.She added that the comparatively small contribution from the UK “further erodes the idea that we need and should still hold on to” King Charles as head of state.According to recent reports,nearly 1 millionof Jamaica’s roughly 2.8 million people were affected by the hurricane, and about 150,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. The prime minister, Andrew Holness, has estimated losses at about US$8bn (£6bn).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jamaica’s health minister, Dr Christopher Tufton, said: “We had to declare an outbreak because of the spike in the number of cases when compared to usual times.” He added that hospitals were equipped to detect and treat the disease.In Britain, theGreen partyalso called for more support for Jamaica, linking climate justice to the legacy of enslavement. The party’s foreign affairs spokesperson said the UK had a “huge historical responsibility in relation to the legacy of slavery”.Ellie Chowns said: “We, as a country, have got to go further and faster to meet our obligations under our international climate targets, but also recognising that wider moral responsibility for the effects of hundreds of years of burning fossil fuels and the warming that that has led to now.“That, coupled with the legacy of slavery, simply can’t be ignored as part of the context of Hurricane Melissa and similar disasters affecting the Caribbean.”The Global Afro-Descendant Climate Justice Collaborative has argued that Melissa’s devastation in Cuba, Haiti and Jamaica is a stark example of how African-descended people aredisproportionately affected by centuries of environmental degradation.It said: “Global warming began with the Industrial Revolutions that were made possible by the resources provided by imperialism, colonialism and enslavement.”Explore more on these topicsJamaicaClimate crisisHumanitarian responseAidCommonwealth of NationsAmericasCaribbeannewsShareReuse this content"

Rescuers also retrieved 47 bodies in Aceh, said Suharyanto, head of the National Disaster Management Agency.0:48Flash floods and landslides cause devastation in Indonesia – videoMore than 3,500 police were deployed to search for people still missing and help distribute aid to more than 28,400 who fled to temporary government shelters across the province.About 80,000 people have been evacuated and hundreds are still stranded in three provinces across Sumatra island, Indonesia’s western-most area, Suharyanto told a news conference, adding that a cloud-seeding operation would begin in West Sumatra to reduce the rainfall, most of which had already subsided by Saturday.InThailand, more than 1.4 million households – 3.8 million people – have been affected by the floods, the department of disaster prevention and mitigation said on Saturday.In southern Thailand, water levels reached 3 metres in Songkhla province and killed at least 145 people in one of the worst floods in a decade.The country’s death toll across eight provinces has risen to 162, the government said on Saturday.View image in fullscreenDamaged cars and motorbikes as flood waters begin to recede in Hat Yai, in southern Thailand’s Songkhla province.Photograph: Narong Sangnak/EPAWorkers at one hospital in hard-hit Hat Yai moved bodies into refrigerated trucks after the morgue exceeded capacity.The prime minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, visited a shelter for evacuees in the district on Friday and told reporters he acknowledged the government’s shortcomings in flood management.“I really have to apologise to them for letting this happen during the time I am in government,” he said in footage broadcast on AmarinTV.“The next step is to prevent the situation from deteriorating,” he added, announcing a two-week timeframe for the district’s clean-up.The Thai government rolled out relief measures for those affected by the flooding, including compensation of up to 2m baht ($62,000, £46,800) for households that lost family members.As flood waters receded, shop owner Rachane Remsringam picked through rubbish strewn between the aisles of his general goods store, lamenting hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses.His store, Madam Yong, was looted and vandalised in the wake of the disaster, he said.There has been growing public criticism of Thailand’s flood response and two local officials have been suspended over their alleged failures.An MP from the opposition People’s party criticised the administration, saying it “wrongly estimated the situation” and made “errors in handling the flood crisis”.One victim of the flood, Amphorn Kaeophengkro, told Reuters she and seven members of her family spent 48 hours perched atop a table, a window frame and a washing machine on the second floor of her home in the city of Hat Yai, which received 335mm (13 inches) of rain last Friday – its highest single-day tally in 300 years.“We weren’t thinking about anything else except surviving,” the 44-year-old told Reuters by candlelight, as her family began to clean their dwelling after the water had receded.Two people were killed inMalaysiaby flooding caused by heavy rain that left stretches of northern Perlis state under water.The annual monsoon season, typically between June and September, often brings heavy rain, triggering landslides and flash floods.A tropical storm has exacerbated conditions, and the tolls in Indonesia and Thailand rank among the highest in floods in those countries in recent years.Climate change has affected storm patterns, including the duration and intensity of the season, leading to heavier rainfall, flash flooding and stronger wind gusts.Reporting from Reuters and Agence France-Presse inPadang, IndonesiaExplore more on these topicsIndonesiaThailandMalaysiaFloodingExtreme weatherAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

There was no fire alarm, so she might not have known there was a fire,” he said.The city’s anti-corruption watchdog said the eight people it arrested on Friday included “consultants, scaffolding subcontractors and [a] middleman of the project”.On Thursday, police said they arrested three men on suspicion of negligently leaving foam packaging at the fire site.On Friday, dozens were still in hospital, with 11 in critical condition, and 21 listed as “serious”.“We do not rule out the possibility that police will find more charred remains when entering [the building] for detailed investigation and evidence collection,” the security chief, Chris Tang, said.At one hospital, a woman surnamed Wong was looking for her sister-in-law and her sister-in-law’s twin, with no luck.“We still cannot find them,” the 38-year-old said. “So we are going to different hospitals to ask if they have good news.”The government said police have activated a specialist disaster victim identification system to help locate the missing.“One building went up in flames and it spread to two more blocks in less than 15 minutes,” a 77-year-old eyewitness surnamed Mui told AFP.“It was burning red, I shudder to think about it.”The blaze was Hong Kong’sdeadliest since 1948, when an explosion followed by a fire killed at least 135 people.Lethal fires were once a regular scourge in densely populated Hong Kong, especially in poorer neighbourhoods, but improved safety measures have made them far less common.Tang said the full investigation into the fire’s causes could take up to four weeks.Authorities had found temporary accommodation for around 800 people, the government said on Friday.Nine emergency shelters were also in operation, accommodating about 720 people overnight.A spontaneous community effortto help firefighters and those displaced has become a well-oiled machine. Separate supply stations for clothes, food and household goods were set up at a public square near the towers, as well as booths providing medical and psychological care.So much was donated that organisers put out a call on social media saying no more was needed.Explore more on these topicsHong Kong apartment firesHong KongAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Yunta is about 300km inland from SA’s capital, Adelaide.At 5pm on Saturday 27 September, Gus was playing on a mound of dirt at the family sheep station.When his grandmother went to call him inside 30 minutes later, he was gone.An extensive police search failed to find him, and wasscaled backin early October.Police had prepared Gus’s family for bad news. He may not have survived “due to the passage of time, his age, and the nature of the terrain he is missing in”, authorities said.View image in fullscreenThe ADF were called in to help search for Gus.Photograph: SA policeA week lateran expanded search was under wayafter “survivability specialists” had given advice about how far Gus could have travelled.So far police, Australian defence force members, State Emergency Service members, a drone, 33 vehicles, dogs, police divers, mounted police and two utility terrain vehicles have been deployed.SA police said it was one of the state’s largest and most intensive searches for a missing person.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailFrom above, the family station is a huddle of regular shapes dwarfed by the seemingly featureless expanse around it.It might be hard to imagine how the huge effort to find the boy has failed in this flat, dusty landscape.At ground level, though, it is scrubby land with dips and ridges, dry creek beds with the occasional copse of trees.View image in fullscreenA dam on the property is searched, without results.Photograph: SA policeThere is a large dam, which police drained on 31 October to no avail.Last week police learned there were also six abandoned, uncovered, unfenced mine shafts on the property.The nearest mine is 5.5km from the homestead, which seems like an astounding distance for a four-year-old to walk. The rest are up to 12km away.“We are determined to explore every avenue in an effort to locate Gus Lamont and provide some closure for his family,” the deputy police commissioner Linda Williams said.But when the mine shafts were searched, there was no sign of Gus.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Three young children, Jane, Arnna and Grant Beaumont,vanished from an Adelaide beachin 1966.Theories and new searches for the trio continue to this day.The outback is also replete with myths, mysteries and murders, adding to the sad intrigue around the Lamont case.People have been spreading conspiracy theories and AI-generated misinformation about the boy and his family. And police have also been frustrated by people calling in with their “opinions”.The family are cooperating with police but are not speaking to the media, and media have been repeatedly warned to stay off the property.Police have not ruled out returning to the property as the investigation continues.Explore more on these topicsSouth AustraliaChildrenAustralian police and policingEmergency servicesRural AustralianewsShareReuse this content"

A spokesperson for O’Brien said he took his responsibilities seriously and would continue to “hold this bad government to account”.Wallace said it was no surprise that energy, law and economy shadow ministers were leading the tally, adding he would not sit quietly while “this hopeless Labor government destroys Australians’ standard of living, their energy affordability and their safety and security”.“They can throw me out of question time every day, but I will continue to fight for my community and the Australian public every singe day that I’m given the honour of serving them,” he said.Ejections from parliamentUnder the order, a member is directed by the speaker to leave the chamber for one hour for “disorderly” behaviour – a direction that can’t be ignored or argued without attracting a longer suspension.ButZali Steggall, a crossbench MP, said it’s not always obvious who the culprits are and, in some cases, it can be a whole section of a political party.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIn 2024 Steggall was embroiled ina heated incidentwith the then opposition leader, Peter Dutton, whom she told in parliament to“stop being racist” before withdrawing the comment, as he interjected over her speech against a motion to suspend the standing orders while discussing visas for people fleeing Gaza.View image in fullscreenZali Steggall speaks during a motion to suspend standing orders.Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAPSteggall said the opposition’s “barrage of yelling and interjections” were akin to a “mob mentality” and “were clearly trying to harass and intimidate me and trying to bully me into silence”.“It’s disrespectful and respect gives no regards to the safety of others in the chamber,” she said. “In any other workplace, that would be considered unlawful conduct.“That mob mentality, at times we see it from the [Albanese] government as well. You see the Labor backbenchers heckling and mob-yelling at other members.”Zali Steggall and David Littleproud clash over mystery man in gallery who ‘flipped the bird’ at politiciansRead moreThe opposition leader, Sussan Ley, haspreviously defended question time unrulinessas “passion”.Steggall, who is serving her third term as the independent member for Warringah, said she wanted to see the speaker given more power to banish MPs for “intimidating, harassing or bullying behaviour”. She suggested the standing orders could also be amended to hold party leaders to account for backbench unruliness, or even expel a whole party for a time.“Parliamentarians need to lead by example,” she said. “Freedom of speech should be encouraged in our workplace but it can’t be used to excuse harmful behaviour and disorderly conduct.”The house speaker, Milton Dick, said he would like to see fewer people leaving the chamber due to disorderly conduct.“But ultimately, if people are obstructing others to have their say, that’s when I will invoke that standing order,” Dick said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It means that once a patient’s yearly gap costs reach $576 (the threshold set for 2025), Medicare pays 100% of the schedule fee for each additional service that year.The extended Medicare safety net,introduced by then-health minister Tony Abbott in 2004, covers out-of-pocket fees, which is the difference between the Medicare rebate and what the doctor or health professional actually charges. Once a patient pays $2,615.50 (the threshold for 2025) in out-of-pocket costs in a year, Medicare will pay for up to 80% of future out-of-pocket costs.$1,000 for a one-hour appointment: why are fees for Australia’s specialist doctors skyrocketing?Read moreWhile government spending on the original safety net has risen more modestly from $14.1m in 2010 to $20.9m in 2025, extended safety net spending has nearly tripled.The government spent$850.4m in 2024 compared with $324.9m in 2010.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailPeter Breadon, the health program director at the Grattan Institute, described this growth as “explosive” during a period when specialist fees have “gone up really fast, and much faster than inflation or the cost of providing care”.Breadon said the system has two key problems. First,the costs are surging because it’s a badly designed subsidy withmoneygoing to fee-charging specialists and the wealthiest patientswho can afford to repeatedly see them. In addition, specialist fees are soaring, pushing more patients over the threshold each year.Q&AHow do I get money back from the Medicare Safety Net?ShowFor individuals, the government will automatically pay you the higher Medicare benefit when you reach the thresholds for both the original and extended safety nets. This applies even if you are an individual eligible for the lower extended safety net threshold as a concession card holder.However, if you are part of a family or couple, you need to register as a family to combine your costs, which may help you reach thresholds sooner. Even if your family members are already on the same Medicare card, you still need to register through Services Australia as a family so they can record your combined expenses.If you are in a registered family you will also need to confirm who’s in your registered Medicare Safety Net family before you can get Safety Net benefits. When your family is close to reaching a Medicare Safety Net threshold, Services Australia will notify the nominated contact person for your family either by a myGov Inbox message or by post.Families eligible for the lower extended safety net threshold are those that are Commonwealth concession cardholders and/or families who receive Family Tax Benefit (Part A).Further information on the safety net, including registration processes, is available from Services Australia’swebsite.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A 2009 article in the Australian Economic Reviewfound the extended Medicare safety net “has possibly created greater inequities in Australia’s healthcare financing arrangements”.The Albanese government is reviewing theMedicare safety nets, and caps onextended safety net benefits for some items first introduced in 2010 to curb fee inflation have been expanded.A spokesperson for the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing said it has established a working group to discuss the operation of the safety nets, issued aconsultation paperfor feedback and is now considering options for reform.Struggling to afford specialist doctors’ fees?

This will deal a significant blow to Russian oil transportation,” the official said in a written statement.Ukraine has been attacking Russian oil refineries for months, using long-range aerial drones to strike far behind the frontlines of Moscow’s full-scale war against Ukraine.The strikes on the tankers represent a different kind of attack. Kyiv has repeatedly called on the west to take real action against Russia’s so-called “shadow fleet”, which the Ukrainian government says is helping Moscow export large quantities of oil and fund its war in Ukraine despite western sanctions. The fleet of hundreds of often ageing, unregulated vessels came to prominence after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, bypassing western sanctions aimed at reducing Moscow’s oil revenue.Separately, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which handles more than 1% of global oil, said on Saturday it halted operations after a mooring at Russia’s Black Sea terminal was significantly damaged by a Ukrainian naval drone attack.CPC exports mainly from Kazakhstan via Russia and the Black Sea terminal. Kazakhstan called the attack unacceptable.Naval drones are uncrewed speedboats packed with explosives that sail towards their targets before detonating. They played a prominent role in Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the Black Sea, helping to push back Russia’s large fleet of warships.The 274-metre-long tanker Kairos suffered an explosion and caught fire on Friday while en route from Egypt to Russia, Turkey’s transport ministry said. The crew was evacuated by rescue boats while efforts to extinguish the fire continued, it said.The Virat was reportedly struck about 35 nautical miles offshore, further east in the Black Sea, the ministry said. That ship was attacked again on Saturday by unmanned vessels, sustaining minor damage to its starboard side above the waterline, the ministry added. It said the vessel was in stable condition and the crew in good health.Both the Kairos and Virat are on a list of ships subject to sanctions imposed against Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, according to LSEG data.Turkey voiced concern over the attacks, saying the incidents took place in its exclusive economic zone and posed serious safety risks.Ankara is in contact with relevant parties to prevent the war from spreading in the Black Sea and to protect the country’s economic interests and operations in the region, Turkish foreign ministry spokesperson Öncü Keçeli said in a post on X.The Ukrainian official did not say when the Ukrainian strikes took place.There was no public comment from Russia.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The attack cut power to the western half of the city, leaving at least 500,000 residents without electricity. Emergency crews have restored power to more than 400,000 households.Zelenskyy faces ‘mini-revolution’ as Yermak’s fall reshapes Ukraine’s wartime power systemRead moreRegional officials and police said one person had died in the region surrounding the capital, two in south-eastern Dnipropetrovsk region and one in a midday attack in Kherson region in the south.“While everyone is discussing points of peace plans, Russia continues to pursue its ‘war plan’ of two points: to kill and destroy,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, wrote on Saturday morning as Kyiv residents surveyed the damage after a heavy night of explosions that mostly targeted the capital.Two waves of attacks could be heard across the capital, the first starting at about 1am and the second at about 7am before an all-clear was given just before 9.30am.Ukraine’s military said it had struck the Afipsky oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai, one of the largest in southern Russia, causing a fire at the plant. The site supplies diesel and jet fuel to Russian forces fighting in Ukraine.Russia is engaged in a campaign to break Ukraine’s civil resistance this winter by attacking its energy infrastructure as the war heads towards its fourth year. The attacks come as a series of key Ukrainian political figures have been embroiled in a corruption scandal.On Friday, Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, wasforced to resign after his flat was searchedby anti-corruption officials investigating a kickback scheme. Two other ministers have already been fired and the scheme’s alleged architect, an old friend of Zelenskyy, has fled the country.Zelenskyy said on Friday that he would restructure the office of the president – which Yermak ran as a gatekeeper to the leader – amid speculation as to who might lead it or how it could be reorganised.An opposition MP called for the president to appoint Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK and the former head of the armed forces. Liudmyla Buimister, a Ukrainian politician, wrote in a social media post that “a man trusted by the military, citizens and international partners is exactly what we need now”.Zaluzhnyi has been considereda potential political challengerto Zelenskyy, though allies of the ambassador said on Saturday they were unsure he would agree if asked.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It demanded that Ukraine withdraw from Donetsk province and agree to a general amnesty, and that the west drop sanctions imposed on Russia.Talks stalled this week during the US Thanksgiving holiday, but are expected to restart shortly. A Ukrainian delegation led by Rustem Umerov, secretary of the country’s national security council, has set out for Washington, Zelenskyy said.On Saturday a US official told Reuters that Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner would meet Ukrainian officials in Florida on Sunday.Ukraine has submitted a 19-point counter proposal, which has been shared with Moscow. Next week, Witkoff is due to arrive in the Russian capital, though few expect a breakthrough, since last week the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, described the Ukrainian leadership as illegitimate.Kyiv’s position is weakened by the corruption scandal, easily the most serious domestic political crisis of Zelenskyy’s presidency, while Russia hopes its continued bombing and a potential financial crisis for Ukraine will wear it down.Ukraine is hoping EU leaders will agree a €140bn (£122bn) loan secured against Russian central bank assets to shore up its budget from next year, butopposition from Belgium, where most of the money is held, has dimmed hopes of reaching an agreement by the end of the year.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussianewsShareReuse this content"

They paid tribute to the “brilliance and humanity” of his work and “his wit, his irreverence, his generosity of spirit and his profound love of the English language”.The Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger was among those remembering a “giant” of theatre who was “highly intellectual and very funny in all his plays and scripts”. “He loved classical and popular music alike which often featured in his huge body of work,” Jagger said. “He was an amusing and a quietly sardonic friend and companion. I will always miss him.”Nicholas Hytner, who directed Stoppard’s play The Hard Problem at the NationalTheatrein London 10 years ago, said: “Tom’s towering achievements came with an astonishing generosity and curiosity about the work of others. His shelves were stacked with the work of other playwrights. He seemed to see everything, and was precise and thrilling when he wrote in appreciation of the things he liked.“He was a great writer and a legendary host but those of us lucky enough to know him and work with him will remember him as an exceptional enhancer of the lives he touched.”The Society of London Theatre announced thatWest Endtheatres will dim their lights for two minutes on Tuesday in remembrance. Its president, Kash Bennett, said Stoppard’s “extraordinary voice reshaped modern theatre, combining intellectual daring, emotional depth and razor-sharp wit in work that challenged, moved and delighted audiences across generations”.Ina post on X, director Rupert Goold wrote: “Tom Stoppard’s magic was present in everything he wrote but he was also the kindest, most supportive, most generous, man.”Author Kathy Lette called him “one of the wittiest people I ever met” and saidon Xthat “a conversation with him left you reeling from irreverent and imaginative quip-lash”.One of a select band of writers from any discipline to earn his own adjective – “Stoppardian” – in the Oxford English Dictionary, he delighted in the most improbable juxtapositions: philosophy and gymnastics inJumpers(1972); early 19th-century landscape gardening and chaos theory in Arcadia (1993); rock music, dissident Czech academics and the love poetry of Sappho inRock ’n’ Roll(2006).A new Stoppard play has been an international event ever since Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, featuring two obscure Shakespearean courtiers, was spotted on the Edinburgh fringe in 1966 and developed by the National Theatre.With his restless imagination, Tom Stoppard showed us a mind on the moveRead moreHe combined more than 30 plays for the theatre with a steady stream of works for television and radio, and with screenplays including an adaptation of John le Carré’s The Russia House, Terry Gilliam’sBraziland a joint credit for the Oscar-winning screenplay ofShakespeare in Love.But his influence went far further than his on-screen credits would suggest: he was the go-to writer for blockbusters in need of a bit of spit and polish (includingIndiana Jones and the Last Crusadeand the Star Wars adventure Revenge of the Sith). Steven Spielberg once dragged him out of the shower with an urgent phone call to discuss a problem withSchindler’s List.Stoppard was thrice married and famously sociable. The playwright Simon Gray captured something of his charmed life when he quipped: “It is actually one of Tom’s achievements that one envies him nothing, except possibly his looks, his talents, his money and his luck. To be so enviable without being envied is pretty enviable, when you think about it.”His early childhood was not auspicious. Born Tomáš Straussler in Czechoslovakia, he was not yet two years old when his Jewish parents fled the Nazi invasion of 1939 for Singapore. Three years later, he was evacuated to India with his mother and brother, leaving his father behind to a fatal confrontation with the Japanese occupation as an army medical officer. After his father’s death, his mother married a British army major, Kenneth Stoppard, who adopted the boys and moved the family back to England after the war.Where to start with Tom Stoppard: from Brazil to LeopoldstadtRead moreStoppard left school at 17, initially to become a journalist on the Western Daily Press in Bristol. After a couple of years of playing around with short radio plays, his first stage play was picked up for the theatre in Hamburg and television in the UK. Moving to London, he wrote theatre reviews under the Evelyn Waugh-inspired pseudonym William Boot, before a Ford Foundation grant enabled him to escape to Berlin to devote himself to the idea that would become Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.Though the intellectual pyrotechnics and bravura theatricality of his early work led some to dismiss him as more head than heart, that began to change with The Real Thing, a meditation on the pain of infidelity and the unstable relationship between art and life, which Michael Billington ranked among the101 greatest playsever written. Premiered in the West End in 1982, it starred Felicity Kendal and Roger Rees in roles that were reprised on Broadway by Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close.During the 15 years after The Real Thing, he hit the top of his game. According to hisbiographerHermione Lee, Stoppard himself felt thatArcadia(1993) was probably his best play, whileThe Invention of Love(1997) – about the poet AE Housman – was his favourite. Only Hapgood (1988) fell foul of the old charge that it was too clever by half, with its combination of spy story and particle theory, though it was widely felt to be vindicated by a 2015 revival at Hampstead theatre.For all his personal sociability, as a writer Stoppard was a loner who did not share the left-leaning political sympathies of his playwriting contemporaries. Describing himself as a “timid libertarian” and “an honorary Englishman”, he was an admirer of Margaret Thatcher and, in 1984, signed a letter of support for the US invasion of Grenada. He was awarded a CBE in 1978 and was knighted in 1997. In 2013, he was awarded thePEN Pinter prizefor his “determination to tell things as they are”.He returned often to his central European origins, with works anatomising the cold war, including Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (1977), commissioned by André Previn for performance with a full onstage orchestra, and his great television play Professional Foul, which was screened in the same year. The latter was dedicated to his friend Václav Havel, who at the time was in and out of jail.He was in his 50s before he discovered the truth about his Jewish origins, and into his 80s by the time the knowledge metabolised into his late-period masterpieceLeopoldstadt, which followed a once-prosperous Viennese family from 1899 to 1955.Explore more on these topicsTom StoppardTheatreCzech RepublicRadioComedyEuropeBroadwaynewsShareReuse this content"

When his friend won victory in the 2019 presidential election, Yermak went with him into politics, first as a foreign policy adviser and then, a year later, as chief of staff.Yermak appeared to become untouchable as he got ever closer to the president during the years of full-scale war. He ran the most sensitive tracks of Ukraine’s foreign policy, speaking regularly with national security advisers from allied countries and was in charge of the team working on peace negotiations.He was also Zelenskyy’s chief political fixer, often giving orders to ministers, and was widely seen as the personification of the president’s will. It was Yermak whotravelled to London to meet former army commander Valerii Zaluzhnyi, widely seen as the most threatening political challenger to Zelenskyy, and pitched Zaluzhnyi to join Zelenskyy’s team.Few people in the Ukrainian elite liked Yermak, but many expressed grudging admiration for his work ethic and his ruthless scheming. Some felt that the level of control, unusual in a democracy, was justified by the wartime context. Additionally, his role as a hate figure often helped to protect Zelenskyy.Even as Yermak’s apartment was searched on Friday, few expected it to push him out of office, as a broad understanding had developed that Zelenskyy was unlikely to sacrifice his most trusted aide at any cost.Although Yermak has not been charged with anything at this point, the anti-corruption investigation threatened to dominate the news agenda and lead to a full-blown crisis, amidgrowing public discontent over corruption.Zelenskyy’s approval rating had already taken a severe hit over the scandal. On Saturday, the Ukrainska Pravda outlet reported via sources that investigators had seized several laptops and mobile phones from Yermak’s apartment for analysis.“For Zelenskyy, it would have been a hard decision to take, he understood the political need but was psychologically dependent on Yermak,” said Fesenko, who suggested it was most likely that Yermak’s resignation had been his own decision and not a case of Zelenskyy ordering him to go. “I think Yermak understood that if he goes down, he’ll bring Zelenskyy down with him, and decided to sacrifice himself to save Zelenskyy.”As always after the downfall of a powerful political figure, the readjustment period could get messy. Some of Yermak’s loyal acolytes will now fear for their jobs, while many others in the elite will breathe a sigh of relief, and will be hoping to gain more direct access to the president.“Yermak was gatekeeping not only the president’s contacts with the outside world but also the information getting through to the president,” said Olena Prokopenko, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Others who fell foul of Yermak or were seen to be growing too popular were unceremoniously fired.Zelenskyy is expected to announce a replacement imminently. Most of the names that have been floated so far are those from the president’s inner circle, but whoever is chosen is unlikely to have anything like the same power as Yermak, at least initially.This could prove challenging for a weakened Zelenskyy, especially if further revelations follow from the corruption investigation. Alternatively, it could give his presidency, already extended by more than a year from its planned endpoint because of the impossibility of holding elections during martial law, the influx of fresh ideas and more consensual decision-making that many have been calling for.“There’s a very strong demand in Ukrainian society for the revision of the social contract between the president and the people, and for restructuring the relationship between president and the cabinet and parliament,” said Prokopenko.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

The answer that came back was 19 states, on 33 occasions. Kallas, the former Estonian prime minister, was not just indulging in some form of historical mathematics. She was seeking to make a point that lies at the heart of the dispute between the US and Europe over Ukraine’s future, a dispute that has again revealed the chasm across the Atlantic about the true nature of the Russian regime.View image in fullscreenRussia’s missile and drone attacks on Ukraine have continued during its negotiations with US officials.Photograph: Sergey Kozlov/EPAKallas reads history books as a leisure activity and – drawing on her own country’s history of Soviet occupation – has long maintained that the Soviet Union fell, but its imperialism never did. “Russia has never truly had to come to terms with its brutal past or bear the consequences of its actions,” she has said, arguing that the nature of the Russian regime means “rewarding aggression will bring more war, not less”: Putin will come back for more.A similar warning was made this week by the German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, who said: “Our intelligence services are telling us urgently: Russia is at least creating the option of a war against Nato by 2029 at the latest.” Putin is recruiting nearly one new division a month, Wadephul said, adding: “Divisions that are undoubtedly also targeting us, at the EU, at Nato.”The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has described Russia “as a constant destabilising power, trying to revise the borders to extend his power”. Putin, he said, is “a predator, an ogre at our gates who constantly needs to eat for his own survival”. In short, “he is a threat to Europeans”.The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, told MPs: “We know that without that deterrence, [Putin] has the ambition to go again, and he will go again – and we must guard against that.”View image in fullscreenKaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, with the UK and Ukrainian leaders, Keir Starmer and Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw/ReutersAll this is diametrically opposite to the view of US isolationists. Steve Witkoff,the New York property developer currently representing the US on the world stage– but alsocoaching Russia on how to win over Donald Trump– has admitted he knows little history, telling the Atlantic in May that he had been watching some Netflix documentaries to rectify this.But based on his four visits to Moscow, he largely treats Russia like any other country, andVladimir Putinlike any other world leader. He told Tucker Carlson he was certain that Russia would not want to take further territory in Europe once Putin was given four regions of Ukraine. “I think there’s this sort of notion of: ‘We’ve all got to be like Winston Churchill – the Russians are gonna march across Europe’ – I think that’s preposterous,” he said.Witkoff added: “I don’t regard Putin as a bad guy. That is a complicated situation, that war and all the ingredients that led up to it. You know, it’s never just one person, right?” Russia genuinely wants peace, he opines. Trump largely holds the same benign view of Putin. His vice-president, JD Vance, has ridiculed the idea that Putin had expansionist designs. Putin was not Hitler, he explained – setting the bar for acceptability quite low. Putin on Thursday offered to put in writing he would not invade another European country.Depressingly for Europe, that means that no matter how frequently it managed to push the Trump pendulum away from Russia, the pendulum reverts back to a natural position of sympathy for Putin. Every time Europe feels it is on the verge of locking Trump into the belief that Russia is an aggressor that threatens European and, by extension, US security, Trump gives Putin another chance, “another two weeks”, another phone call. Trump’s one fixed belief is thatUkrainecannot win the war, and should cut its losses.Who leaked Witkoff’s call advising Kremlin on how to get Trump on side?Read moreView image in fullscreenA building damaged by a Russian strike in the partly occupied Zaporizhzhia region on Tuesday.Photograph: Ukrinform/ShutterstockBut never untilthe emergence this month of a 28-point US-Russian plan to end the war– and the subsequent revelation that Witkoff had apparently coached Russian officials on how to win Trump round – had European leaders seen precisely how US officials envisioned a new European order in which Russia, in the name of realism, is rewarded and not punished for its unlawful invasion of Ukraine. Once again blind-sided by Trump, European leaders read paragraph after paragraph of the US proposal with a mixture of disbelief and panic.The former French president François Hollande said: “We are living through a moment that is both historic and dramatic. It is historic because this plan not only marks Ukraine’s capitulation, but also Europe’s relegation to the tutelage of a Russian-American condominium. It is dramatic because, for Ukraine, it means the definitive loss of a third of its territory and offers no security guarantees to protect it from further Russian aggression. It is dramatic, too, because this plan is nothing more than Trump adopting Vladimir Putin’s demands, reducing Europe to the role of a besieged bystander”.Josep Borrell, Kallas’s predecessor as head of EU foreign affairs, said: “Trump’s plan to end the war in Ukraineexposes the failure of the EU’s appeasement strategy. Giving in to his demands on military spending, tariffs, digital deregulation, multinational taxation and energy supplies has achieved nothing. With the 28-point plan to end the war in Ukraine, Trump’s United States can no longer be considered an ally of Europe, which is not even consulted on matters affecting its own security. Europe must acknowledge this shift in US policy and respond accordingly.”François Heisbourg, senior adviser for Europe at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, compared the plan to the 1940 armistice signed between Nazi Germany and a defeated France. “It is essentially a peace arranged on Russia’s terms,” he said.John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser turned critic, was even more scathing. “I’m thinking of all those people over the past year who have been saying: ‘Hey, Trump’s changed his mind, he’s going to support Ukraine.’ I don’t know how many times it will take to prove it. He doesn’t care about Ukraine,” he said.German CDU foreign policy expert Norbert Röttgen described the moment as a turning point “because it means the US is siding with Putin and selling out both Ukraine’s sovereignty and the security of Europe. The previous assumption of a transatlantic alliance and a security guarantee from the US is no longer compatible.” Even if the 28-point plan does not come to pass, Röttgen said that “something fundamental has happened. We no longer live in the world as it was.”View image in fullscreenMourners at a funeral in Kharkiv on Wednesday.Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesBut if it was legitimate for European politicians outside government to condemn Trump’s betrayal, it was the responsibility of European leaders to minimise the impact – especially before the arbitrary thanksgiving deadline Trump had set for Ukraine.“Our first job, frankly, was to find out what had been going on,” admits one British diplomat. It was reportedly at a Berlin dinner on 18 November that Starmer, Macron and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, first exchanged notes on the scale of what Witkoff had been cooking up. The European magazine had got wind of a new initiative through a briefing Witkoff gave to Ukraine’s national security adviser, Rustem Umerov, at a weekend meeting in Miami.If so, that was a full month after Witkoff, flush with his ceasefire in Gaza,first rang Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s top foreign policy aide, to advise him that he wanted to repeat the exercise in Ukraine. He advised that the Russian leader should speak to Trump before the US president met the Ukrainian leader at the White House at a meeting scheduled for 17 October.View image in fullscreenThe Harvard-educated Kremlin adviser Kirill Dmitriev with US special envoy Steve Witkoff.Photograph: Vyacheslav Prokofyev/APWitkoff’s tipoff helped ensure the 150-minute call between Putin and Trump on 15 October went well enough for the US president to pull back from giving the Ukrainians Tomahawk missiles that they had been expecting. Instead, Trump said he was planning a second summit with Putin – this time in Budapest.But at this point, US policy on Ukraine was starting to fracture. After a phone call with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on 21 October, the US secretary of state and acting national security adviser, Marco Rubio, concluded that there was in fact no point in Trump meeting Putin, since Russia had not changed its positions since the inconclusive Alaska summit. The two sides were still too far apart about Ukraine’s sovereignty. On 22 October, US sanctions were imposed on Rosneft Oil and Lukoil, the first on Russia since Trump returned to office.Undaunted, Witkoff metKirill Dmitriev, a Harvard-educated senior Kremlin adviser, in Miami. Few in the state department knew of these secret contacts, but it was in Florida that the outlines of the 28-point peace plan started to be drafted. Judging by the subsequentphone calls leaked to Bloomberg, Dmitriev sensed Witkoff was amenable to working with a Russian draft that amounted to a compendium of Russian talking points.Nevertheless, Europe is now well-drilled in responding to Trump’s occasional lunges to rehabilitate and reward Putin: first, welcome the fact of Trump’s intervention, before slowly and politely smothering it.View image in fullscreenTracer rounds shoot through the sky as Ukrainian air defence systems fire at Russian drones and missiles above Kyiv.Photograph: Sergei Supinsky/AFP/Getty ImagesSo, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, went through the formulaic mark of respect for the US president’s efforts, but could not hide the gravity of what he called “one of the most difficult moments in our history”.“Ukraine could face a very difficult choice:the loss of dignity or the risk of losing a key partner, the United States,” he said in a video address to the nation.Agreeing to the US proposals would mean “a life without freedom, without dignity, without justice”, he said.Three factors helped the European rescue operation. First, the draft was so lopsided and so prescriptive about Europe’s security as to be indefensible. Rather than substitute an alternative, the Europeans chose instead to gut the Witkoff project. Making Trump’s plan the starting point was intended to avoid antagonising the Americans: it acknowledged Trump’s efforts as legitimate.Secondly, the disputes within the US administration could no longer be concealed – principally the feud between Vance and Rubio. This helped the Atlanticist wing in the Senate, already worried about the president’s plunging poll ratings, torediscover its backbone and voice. That, in turn, led Vance to make some ill-tempered assaults on Congress. “There is an illusion that simply giving more money, more weapons, or imposing more sanctions will bring victory within reach. Peace will not be achieved by failed diplomats or politicians living in a fantasy world. It could be achieved by intelligent people living in the real world,” he said. It left Rubio walking a tightrope, remaining loyal to an unpredictable president but clearly telling US senators that this was not a US plan.Finally, Europe maintained its unity, despite petty rivalries about the roles of France, Germany and Britain. After a succession of meetings at the G20 in Johannesburg, an EU-Africa summit in Luanda, a nine-hour negotiation in Geneva, a further meeting in Abu Dhabi, and finally a video call of the 35-nation “coalition of the willing”, the Europeans held together.View image in fullscreenDozens of people were killed when a Russian missile destroyed a block of flats in Ternopil, western Ukraine, last week.Photograph: Maxym Marusenko/EPAOf the original 28 points,only 19 remained by Monday evening, with those that affected European security or the future of Nato removed. Some paragraphs were simply deleted, such as the proposal to readmit Russia into the G7 or to allow the US to seize frozen Russian central bank assets, mostly held in European countries, to fund reconstruction efforts. The idea that the US would also drop all sanctions imposed on Russia was excised, and a ambiguous reference to Eurofighters and Poland disappeared.With its overarching view that Russia under its current leadership would always represent a threat, the key European focus has been to ensure any agreement prevents Russia from further military aggression. “The absolute condition for a good peace is a series of very robust security guarantees, and not guarantees only on paper,” said Macron.Some of those guarantees could be provided by a deployment of the so-called coalition of the willing. Starmer insists that plans are in place covering capability, coordination and command structure, but it is unclear whether the US will provide any additional guarantees. Rubio has agreed to set up a working party to explore how a US guarantee could be more than Trump deciding how he will react if and when Russia invades western Ukraine.Three Ukrainian red lines have been reserved for further talks: conceding key parts of Donbas currently under Ukrainian control, accepting restrictions on its army, and Nato forever barring Ukraine from membership.Disarray over leaked US-Russia peace plan is ideal scenario for PutinRead moreBut regardless of what emerges from this latest fiasco – and the fierce negotiations may only be starting – the damage to the transatlantic alliance piles up. Europe now has to realise it must confront the Russian question alone. Unlike in Alaska, this time the US was lured into signing up to Russia’s plans to remake Europe in Russia’s interests. In so doing, according to French historian Françoise Thom,the US made itself complicit in the dismantlement of international law.Trump could yet block arms and intelligence to force through his peace, but it is equally possible this initiative will fizzle out, as Putin rejects the revised terms next week and the war grinds on, after distracting and weakening Ukrainian morale that is already strained by allegations of corruption.Some figures, such as Kallas, insist that Russia can be brought to breaking point as it runs out of money, especially if Europe finds a lawful way to give Ukraine a reparations loan drawing on frozen Russian central bank assets worth €210bn. But Europe has vowed to get its act together so often. Inertia, not Russia, may have become its own worst enemy.This article was amended on 29 November 2025.

Israel still carries out strikes in response to what it has called violations of the truce, and bodies from earlier in the war are being recovered from the rubble.The health ministry said the Palestinian toll is now 70,100. The department operates under the Hamas-run government. It is staffed by medical professionals and maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by the international community.The war began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people died and 250 were taken hostage. Almost all the hostages or their remains have been returned in ceasefires or other deals.Staff at Nasser hospital, which received the bodies of the children in southern Gaza, said the brothers, aged 8 and 11, died when an Israeli drone struck close to a school sheltering displaced people in the town of Beni Suheila.Israel’s military said it killed two people who crossed into an Israeli-controlled area, “conducted suspicious activities” and approached troops. The statement did not mention children. The military said it also killed another person in a separate but similar incident in the south.Israel still committing genocide in Gaza, Amnesty International saysRead moreAt least 352 Palestinians have been killed across the territory since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.Israel says its strikes are aimed at militants violating the truce. Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the deal. Hamas again urged mediators on Saturday to pressure Israel to stop what it called ceasefire violations in Gaza.A US blueprint outlining the future of Gaza, which has been devastated by more than two years of war, is still in the early stages. The plan to secure and govern the territory authorises an international stabilisation force to provide security, approves a transitional authority to be overseen by the US president, Donald Trump, and envisions a possible path to an independent Palestinian state.Israeli forces have pushed forward on a number of other fronts in the region in recent weeks.Syrian officials said that Israeli forces raided a Syrian village on Friday and opened fire when they were confronted by residents, killing at least 13 people. Israel said it conducted the operation to apprehend suspects of a militant group planning attacks in Israel, and that the militants opened fire at troops, wounding six.Israel has also escalated strikes inLebanon, saying it is targeting Hezbollah sites and asserting the militant group is attempting to rearm.Hezbollah called on Pope Leo XIV to “reject injustice and aggression,” in reference to the near-daily Israeli strikes, despite a ceasefire that ended the 14-month war between the two sides a year ago. The pope is visiting the region on hisfirst foreign trip.In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Israeli soldiers were accused by Palestinians of executing two men on Thursday after footage aired by two Arab television stations showed troops shooting them after they appeared to surrender. The Israeli military said it was investigating.Israeli settler violence has continued to rise in the West Bank. On Saturday, the Palestinian Red Crescent said 10 Palestinians were injured by beatings and live ammunition during settler attacks in Khallet al-Louza village close to Bethlehem.Explore more on these topicsPalestineIsraelHamasLebanonMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The latest figures published by theIsraeli human rights group B’Tselemsaid that as of the end of September the Israel Prison Service was holding 3,474 Palestinians in “administrative detention”, meaning without trial.‘Cruellest forms of torture’: freed Palestinians describe horrors of Israeli jailRead moreThe new UN report, covering a two-year period since the beginning of the Gaza war on 7 October 2023, draws attention to the “high proportion of children who are currently detained without charge or on remand”, noting the age of criminal responsibility imposed by Israel is 12, and that children younger than 12 have also been detained.Children categorised as security prisoners, the report says, “have severe restrictions on family contact, may be held in solitary confinement, and do not have access to education, in violation of international standards”. It appeals to Israel to amend its legislation so that solitary confinement is not used against children.The UN committee, which was established to monitor implementation of the 1984 UN convention against torture, goes further, arguing that the daily imposition of Israeli policies in occupied Palestine, taken as a whole, “may amount to torture”.The report said 75 Palestinians had died in custody over the course of the Gaza war, during which detention conditions for Palestinians had undergone a “marked deterioration”. It found the death toll to be “abnormally high and appears to have exclusively affected the Palestinian detainee population”. It notes that “to date, no state officials have been held responsible or accountable for such deaths”.Israel’s government has repeatedly denied the use of torture. The UN committee heard evidence from representatives of the country’s foreign ministry, justice ministry and prison service who argued that prison conditions were adequate and subject to supervision.However, the committee pointed out that the inspector charged with investigating complaints on interrogations had brought “no criminal prosecutions for acts of torture and ill-treatment” over the past two years, despite widespread allegations of such practices.1:24Moment Israeli forces shoot dead surrendered Palestinians – video reportIt said that Israel had pointed to just one conviction for torture or ill-treatment in that two-year period, an apparent reference to anIsraeli soldier sentenced in Februarythis year for repeatedly attacking bound and blindfolded detainees from Gaza with his fists, a baton and his assault rifle. In that case, the committee found that the seven-month sentence “appears not to reflect the severity of the offence”.The report was published on a day when three Israeli border police officers were released after questioning overthe fatal shooting of two Palestinianswho had been detained in Jenin.Video of the incidenton Thursday evening showed the two men, Youssef Asasa and Mahmoud Abdallah, crawling out of a building. Asasa and Abdallah can be seen holding their hands up and lifting their shirts to show they are unarmed.The men, both claimed by Palestinian Islamic Jihad as fighters in its al-Quds Brigades, were detained for a few seconds by border police officers, including a bald-headed officer with a beard who appears in the video to take charge and kick both detainees before making a gesture, seemingly ushering them back inside the building. Seconds later Asasa and Abdallah were shot by the officers at a range of about 2 metres.According to Israeli media, the three border officers questioned on Friday about the incident claimed they “felt an immediate and tangible threat” to their lives. In their reported account of what happened the two detainees had refused to strip naked and had “put their hands in their pockets”, and then one of the men tried to “escape back into the building”.The video from the scene, the authenticity of which has not been disputed by the Israeli authorities, does not show any obvious resistance from the two men, nor does it show them with their hands in their pockets. They appear to be reluctant to re-enter the building under the apparent orders from the border police officer.The three border police officers were released after questioning on condition they did not discuss the case with others.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He eventually left the territory shortly after the second short-lived truce during the war came into effect in January. His eyewitness account, A Historian in Gaza, was published in French in May andin Englishthis month.In the book, Filiu describes Israeli military attacks on security personnel protecting aid convoys. These permitted looters to seize huge quantities of food and other supplies destined for desperately needy Palestinians, he writes. Famine threatened parts ofGazaat the time, according to international humanitarian agencies.UN agencies at the timetold the Guardianthat law and order had deteriorated across Gaza since Israel began targeting police officers, who guarded aid convoys. Israel considered police in Gaza, which has been run by Hamas since 2007, an integral part of the militant Islamist organisation.In his book, Filiu describes an incident that, he says, took place very close to where staying in al-Mawasi, a supposed “humanitarian zone” packed with hundreds of thousands of people displaced from their often destroyed homes elsewhere, when, after continuous attacks on its convoys over weeks by local criminals, militias and desperate ordinary people, the UN decided to test a new itinerary that aid officials hoped would preventlooting.Sixty-six trucks carrying flour and hygiene kits headed west from the Israeli checkpoint at Kerem Shalom along the corridor bordering Egypt, and then north on the main coastal road, Filiu says. Hamas was determined to handle security for the convoy and recruited powerful local families along its route to provide armed guards. However, the convoy quickly came under fire.“It was one night and I was … a few hundred metres away. And it was very clear that Israeli quadcopters were supporting the looters in attacking the local security [teams],” Filiu writes.The Israeli military killed “two local notables as they sat in their car, armed and ready to protect the convoy”, Filiu says, and twenty trucks were robbed, though the UN considered the loss of one-third of the convoy a relative improvement on the looting of nearly all the previous loads, according to Filiu.“The [Israeli] rationale [was] to discredit Hamas and the UN at that time … and to allow [Israel’s] clients, the looters, to either redistribute the aid to expand their own support networks or to make money out of reselling it in order to get some cash and so not depend exclusively on Israeli financial support,” Filiu said.Israeli officials denied the charge. A military spokesperson said that in incident described by Filiu, an Israeli Air Force aircraft “conducted a precise strike on a vehicle with armed terrorists inside who were planning “to divert humanitarian aid into Hamas storage units and violently [take] over an aid truck in the area of Dier al-Balah.”“The strike was conducted to ensure a hit on the terrorists while avoiding damaging the aid. The IDF continues to operate against the Hamas terrorist organisation and is doing everything possible to mitigate harm to uninvolved civilians. The IDF … will also continue to act in accordance with international law to enable and facilitate the transfer of humanitarian aid to the residents of the Gaza Strip,” the spokesperson said.Filiu’s accusations echo those made by some aid officials at the time. An internal United Nations memo described Israel’s“passive, if not active benevolence”towards some gangs responsible for looting in Gaza.Filiu also accused Israeli forces of attacking a new route recently opened by international aid organisations to allow them to avoid looting blackspots.“The World Food Programme was trying to set up an alternative route to the coastal road and Israeli bombed the middle of the road … It was a deliberate attempt to put it out of action,” the historian told the Guardian.Israel, which imposed tight restrictions or even a total blockade on aid entering Gaza during the war, rejected allegations that it deliberately obstructed aid or supported looters. However, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu did admit that Israel had assisted the Popular Forces, an anti-Hamas militiathat included many looters amongst its recruits.Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of systematically stealing aid in order to supply its own forces or to raise funds for political or military operations. Hamas denied the charges.Filiu, who has been visiting Gaza for many decades, said he had been shocked to find that “anything that stood before” in the territory had been “erased, annihilated” in the war, which was triggered by a Hamas raid into Israel in October 2023. About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in that attack and 250 taken hostage. Israel’s ensuing offensive killed nearly 70,000, mostly civilians, and reduced much of the territory to rubble.“Any successful counterinsurgency anywhere over history … has to balance the military operation with some kind of political campaign to win hearts and minds,” Filiu said.“[Israel] didn’t even pretend to do that in Gaza at any time, [but] Gaza is probably the place on Earth where Hamas is the most unpopular because in Gaza they know Hamas [and] don’t have any illusions about the reality of Islamist domination and the brutality of its rules.”The historian said the conflict in Gaza could have enormous consequences. “I’ve always been convinced that it’s a universal tragedy. It’s not one more Middle Eastern conflict. It’s a laboratory of a post-UN world, of a post Geneva convention world, of a post-declaration of human rights world, and this world is very scary because it’s not even rational,” Filiu said. “It’s just ferocious.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The trial wascriticised as deeply flawedby the Inter-Parliamentary Union, an international organisation.Despite intense pressure from Hamas and the Gulf states,Israelrefused to release him as part of the large-scale prisoner exchange that occurred at the time of the ceasefire on 13 October. At one point Donald Trump admitted he was himself considering pushing for his release.Barghouti, a member of theFatahparty, a bitter rival of Hamas, is an advocate of a two-state solution. Many believe Israel is refusing to release him because they know he will be an effective spokesperson for the Palestinian cause.Barghouti has frequently been kept in solitary confinement without access to his family, and he has allegedly suffered fourmajor beatings inside prisonsince 2023, but is said to be still physically and mentally capable of becoming an effective political leader if he is released.He has not seen his family for three years and his lawyers have seen him five times in two years. The International Committee of the Red Cross has been banned from seeing him, in a breach of international law.Zohran Mamdani is re-writing the political rules around support for Israel | Kenneth RothRead moreMost recently, he has beentaunted and threatened with executionby Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, as captured on video. The Knesset is studying a new bill backed by Ben-Gvir that would permit the death penalty to be imposed on those convicted of nationalist motivated murder.A pillar of Fatah and thePalestineLiberation Organization, but jailed while Yasser Arafat was still at the helm, it is thought Barghouti could restore credibility to both movements, which have been weakened by the long rule of Mahmoud Abbas, the current president.An Israeli court in 2004 issued five life sentences against Barghouti plus 40 years for allegedly helping to plan deadly attacks during the second intifada.In a bid to start shifting Israeli public opinion, his wife Fadwa Barghouti has given her first interviews to the Israeli press. She stressed her husband “sees the two-state solution as the way to move forward and live in peace”.Arab Barghouti, his son, said his father “represents hope to Palestinians at a time when there are efforts to silence him and make him forgotten”.He added: “Seeing people around the world raise his name gives me hope. I wish our family’s experience was unique, but thousands of Palestinian families endure the same pain.“Honouring him in this way is not only a call for his freedom – it is a call for the release of all Palestinian prisoners and a stand for justice for every family still waiting.”Explore more on these topicsPalestineWest BankIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaFatahnewsShareReuse this content"

They were later rescued by naval boats.The cyclone made landfall on Wednesday, triggering record rainfall across the island. The flooding situation in low-lying areas worsened on Saturday, prompting authorities to issue evacuation orders for those living along the banks of the Kelani River, which flows through Colombo into the Indian Ocean.The Kelani burst its banks on Friday evening, forcing hundreds of people to move to temporary shelters, the DMC said.One woman, Mallika Kumari, who lives by the river in Malwana, east of Colombo, was rescued by boat and transported to safety with her children.“I first heard about the flood warning on TV but we never expected the river to overflow so quickly. We just rushed out of the house without anything,” Kumari told Reuters.In the rush, Kumari left behind her cat, which was later picked up by a navy boatcrew.Other residents chose to remain in the upper floors of partially submerged homes, protecting their belongings.Rains have subsided in most parts of the country, including the capital, but parts of the island’s north have continued to experience showers due to the residual effects of the cyclone.The DMC said earlier that the death toll had climbed with the recovery of more bodies in the worst-affected central region, where most victims were buried alive as mudslides hit this week.Some regions had recorded 360mm of rain in the past 24 hours, the DMC said on Friday.VSA Ratnayake, 56, said he had to leave his flooded home in Kaduwela, near Colombo. “I think this could be the worst flood in our area for three decades,” Ratnayake said. “I remember a flood in the 1990s when my house was under 7ft of water.”Kalyani, 48, also from Kaduwela, said she was sheltering two families whose homes were flooded.View image in fullscreenPeople leave their homes in Wellampitiya, near Colombo.Photograph: Tharaka Basnayaka/NurPhoto/ShutterstockAt least 3,000 homes have been damaged by mudslides and floods.

This week’s weather-related toll is the highest since June last year.Dozens of stranded tourists were evacuated to Colombo from the tea-growing central areas of the island on Friday.The Sirasa TV network broadcast an appeal for help from a desperate woman. “We are six people, including a one-and-a-half-year-old child. If the water rises another five steps up the staircase, we will have nowhere to go,” she said by phone.Sri Lanka is in its north-east monsoon season, but rainfall has intensified because of Cyclone Ditwah, the DMC said.Sri Lanka depends on seasonal monsoon rains for irrigation and hydroelectricity, but experts have warned that the country faces more frequent floods owing to the climate crisis.The worst floodingSri Lanka has experienced since the turn of the centuryoccurred in June 2003, when hundreds of people were killed.Explore more on these topicsSri LankaSouth and central AsiaExtreme weatherFloodingClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Appearing at a leftwing festival in Manchester last month,Sultana jokingly compared the duo to the Gallagher brothers, saying: “I’m here to tell you the show is back on the road.”Yet when the doors to the conference centre in Liverpool opened on Saturday morning, Sultana was curiously absent. As Corbyn delivered his opening address, she was sipping hot chocolate in a cafe about a mile from the venue.It became evident there was no unified position on how the party should be led. Corbyn told journalists he favoured a traditional leadership model, with one person elected to take charge, and suggested he’d be likely to run if members voted for this option.View image in fullscreenZarah Sultana wants Your Party to have a collective leadership structure, whereas Jeremy Corbyn favours a traditional model.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PABut in an interview with the Guardian, Sultana said she was supporting a collective leadership structure, with key decisions being taken by lay members – those not already serving as MPs or councillors. She added that she did not think parties should be run by “sole personalities”. She did, however, indicate she would be willing to stand against Corbyn if there was a contest for a single leader.Although Sultana insisted she and the former Labour leader were getting on “really well” – they had, she said, spoken about how they wanted the conference to be “a positive, joyful experience where members feel empowered” – she was scathing about some of his allies and Your Party officials whom she believes are briefing against her. She refused to provide names, but it is understood that relations between her supporters and Corbyn’s former chief of staff Karie Murphy are particularly fraught.The Coventry South MP – who defected from Labour in July – added that there was still a “toxic culture” among others in Your Party, which had led to “bullying, intimidation and smears” and “acts of deliberate sabotage”.‘We had six MPs and four factions’: inside Your Party’s toxic power strugglesRead moreTensions came to a head around lunchtime when it emerged Sultana would boycott the first day of the conference, in solidarity with would-be delegates who had been turned away from the event due to affiliations with other leftwing groups – particularly the Socialist Workers party. Her spokesperson described this as a “witch-hunt”, adding: “We must build a party that welcomes all socialists.”Allies of Corbyn – who wrongly asserted on Saturday morning that the Socialist Workers party was registered with the Electoral Commission – were furious, accusing Sultana of attempting to stage a “sideshow”. They believe allowing multiparty membership would cause disruption andincrease the factionalismwhich already appears to have crippled the fledgling movement.View image in fullscreenSupporters during the Your Party founding conference.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAOn the status of the Socialist Workers party, one Corbyn ally said: “It might not be registered with the Electoral Commission but it is still a party. The clue is in the name.”Many delegates were frustrated that Saturday’s proceedings descended into factionalism when they would have preferred to discuss key issues such as the cost of living crisis and immigration, as well as strategising for next year’s local elections.Your Party is yet to decide if it will field its own candidates or back socialist independents and some members feel the party will have failed if it is not on the ballot paper as an alternative to Labour.It remains to be seen if proceedings can be salvaged on Sunday, when the results of key votes – such as theparty’s permanent nameand leadership structure – will be announced. Sultana plans to attend and give a speech, which has comforted those who still hope for unity.Yet most delegates remained despondent as they shuffled out of the conference hall into a rainy Liverpool night on Saturday. Perhaps the mood of the day was summed up by one, who said: “My large glass of wine is turning into a bottle.”Explore more on these topicsJeremy CorbynZarah SultanaLabournewsShareReuse this content"

There should not be a single person born in Pakistan in the UK House of Commons.”White, who has more than 18,000 followers onX, is one of a new generation of activists seeking to inject far-right language into public debate. By Thursday afternoon, the comment had been retweeted more than 1,300 times and liked more than 9,000 times on X, which has increasingly become a platform for misinformation and xenophobic content since its previous incarnation, Twitter, was bought by Elon Musk.She is listed as a “global public policy advisor” on the website of Gunster Strategies, a US lobbying firm that claims to work with clients such as Coca-Cola and AstraZeneca.View image in fullscreenNusrat Ghani speaking in the chamber in October 2024. White said: ‘There should not be a single person born in Pakistan in the UK House of Commons.’Photograph: House of CommonsFormerly a staff member for a Conservative MP, White is also an activist with the Women’s Safety Initiative, a group that weaponises women’s safety to advance anti-migrant rhetoric. It sought to exploit the tensions in the UK last summer around asylum seeker accommodation.White has cast doubt previously on Shabana Mahmood’s suitability to be home secretary because she is of Pakistani heritage. White made the remarks in an appearance with Jeremy Kyle onTalkTV.0:26Lucy White talks about Shabana Mahmood on TalkTV – videoEarlier this month, she also said: “People like Mahmood, a Pakistani Muslim who has the audacity to larp [live-action role play] around as English, is the cause of division in our country. The only way to ‘unite a divided country’ is by sending the third worlders home. They will be more comfortable with their own people and so will we.”TalkTV described White as an occasional contributor, adding: “The views she expresses are her own, and her recent social media post referring to Nus Ghani was reprehensible. We have no plans to invite Lucy White back on Talk in the foreseeable future.”However, GB News stopped short of saying it would not air her views in the future. A spokesperson said: “Comments expressed on personal social media accounts by individuals who have appeared on our platforms do not reflect the views or values of the channel.”Tell Mama, a national project which records and measures anti-Muslim incidents, is to write to GB News to seek an explanation. “Anyone espousing such views essentially marginalises and takes out of our political life anyone who has an international heritage. This is distinctly discriminatory and verges on racially segregated discourse which is simply a red line,” said a spokesperson.View image in fullscreenWhite called Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary,  ‘a Pakistani Muslim who has the audacity to larp [live-action role play] around as English’.Photograph: James Manning/PALiam Walker, an Oxfordshire Conservative councillor, responded on X by saying: “Lucy is a racist.

In the county council elections in May I noticed when knocking on doors how open people were to saying things they would not have come out with before. It’s down to social media but also it’sReform UK, who clearly have a problem in their party.”The Liberal Democrat MP Josh Babarinde said: “When you have people like Nigel Farage, with the allegations about racism and antisemitismcoming to light in his pastand hisfailing to answer questionsabout them, and the likes of his colleague Sarah Pochin talking about how seeing black and Asian people in TV advertsdrives her mad, it clearly emboldens people.“It emboldens parts of our society to scale up that racism in their own ways. Unless it is called out by people across the political spectrum it is going to get worse.”The controversy comes amid concern about the increasing prevalence of racist language in political and public life. Reform UK wasaccused this monthof embracing racism after it picked Matthew Goodwin, a former academic who argued that UK-born people from minority ethnic backgrounds were not necessarily British, as the head of its new student organisation.Ghani became the first Muslim female minister to speak from the Commons dispatch box and the first Muslim woman elected as a Tory MP in 2015. Born in Kashmir to Pakistani parents, she grew up in Birmingham before studying at Birmingham City University and Leeds.Ghaniretweeteda comment by Nazir Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England, who commented on White’s post by saying: “People whining about ‘British values’ while abandoning the biggest one: democracy. Nus Ghani earned her seat through votes, hard work, and public service. If that threatens you, it’s not her citizenship you’re worried about. She is British, elected by Brits, doing a British job.”White, who has a picture of herself being interviewed on GB News by Goodwin,has said in the pastthat her views had resulted in her being labelled a racist while studying at Cambridge and among schoolfriends.Explore more on these topicsGB NewsRaceXSocial mediaHouse of CommonsTalkTVLobbyingnewsShareReuse this content"

Delegates in Liverpool will choose between electing a sole leader or a collective of lay members – those not already serving as MPs or councillors.The party has been beset by infighting since plans for it were first announced in July after Sultana announced her defection from Labour, saying she and Corbyn would co-lead a new political organisation. Allies of Corbyn were quick to brief that a final decision had not been made.The pair appeared to strike a fragile peace, with Sultanalikening their relationship to that of Noel and Liam Gallagher. Corbyn said on Saturday that he would “probably favour the single leadership model” but would “live with whatever [members] decide on”.However, her decision to skip the first day of proceedings is likely to go down badly with Corbyn and his aides. It is understood that one of her supporters, James Giles, a councillor in Kingston, was barred from entering the conference centre. Other members were expelled on Friday over alleged membership of the Socialist Workers party.Corbyn told journalists on Saturday that entry to Your Party was granted on the condition members were not aligned with other parties registered with the Electoral Commission.He added: “The Socialist Workers party is registered with the Electoral Commission, therefore it is another party. I think to call it a purge is a bit of exaggeration quite honestly.”It was later clarified that the Socialist Workers party is not registered with the Electoral Commission.A spokesperson for Sultana said: “Zarah met members outside conference and condemned the recent expulsions. This witch-hunt is indefensible. We must build a party that welcomes all socialists.“She will not be entering the conference hall today.” It is understood Sultana will attend the conference on Sunday to deliver a planned speech.A Your Party spokesperson said: “These claims are false. Members of another national political party signed up to Your Party in contravention of clearly stated membership rules – and these rules were enforced.”Speaking before Sultana announced her boycott, Corbyn had hinted to journalists that he was ready to stand as leader in a contest. “I’m very happy to serve the party in whatever capacity they decide they want me to serve,”he said.Sultana said she supported collective leadership in the absence of the option for two co-leaders. She said: “I’ve publicly supported a co-leadership model. The fact it hasn’t been given to members as an option to vote on is regrettable, and the fact that has been decided by a faceless, nameless bureaucrat is quite concerning.”She said she was “championing collective leadership” because she felt it offered “maximum member democracy”.“I don’t think movements should be led by sole personalities. I think you have to represent the broad mass movement,” she said. “That allows responsibility to be shared and more people’s ideas to be listened to. It strengthens the movement. With that, comes a structure which has a parliamentary convener. They are also elected by the membership.“Should the members choose sole leadership, I would consider throwing my hat in the ring. I will then respect whatever the members decide and completely ride in behind that.”Corbyn and Sultana said they would consider electoral pacts with other leftwing parties, including the Greens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That has to be the guiding principle for all of us who want to stop fascism.”Corbyn said it “would essentially be a decision for the local branches of Your Party” to judge what was best in their area, but he that he would not rule out cooperating with the Green party, which has enjoyed a rise in popularity under its new leader, Zack Polanski.Tensions between Corbyn, the former Labour leader who is now an independent MP for Islington North, and Sultana, who represents Coventry South, escalated when Sultana launched a membership portal, collecting about £800,000 in donations and reams of members’ data.Sultana said on Saturday that £600,000 had already been transferred from a holding company to Your Party and that the remainder of the money would be sent when liabilities had been processed.She said she was now getting on “really well” with Corbyn and that the pair had been communicating about the conference, which she said they wanted to be “a positive, joyful experience where members feel empowered”.‘We had six MPs and four factions’: inside Your Party’s toxic power strugglesRead moreHowever, tensions between Sultana and key allies of Corbyn persist. Relations with his former chief of staff Karie Murphy are believed to be particularly strained.Sultana admitted there was still a “toxic culture” in Your Party, which had led to “bullying, intimidation and smears” and “acts of deliberate sabotage”.She said: “I can definitely say that toxic culture I’ve experienced needs to be rooted out. I would say that is directly from the handbook of the Labour right. It’s shocking to experience in a new leftwing, socialist party. We do need to dismantle that culture.“I think there are people who are around Jeremy – not Jeremy himself – who have learned the wrong lessons from their time in the Labour party, where they have been on the wrong end of smears, of sabotage, attacks in the rightwing press … they are now using the same tactics when really we should have a healthy climate of being able to debate and disagree.”In his speech on Saturday, Corbyn called for unity. “As a party, we’ve got to come together and be united, because division and disunity will not serve the interests of the people that we want to represent,” he said.He also called for “public, democratic ownership” of the water industry, led a chant of “free, free Palestine” and urged party members to “campaign forevermore for real socialism and real social justice”.Explore more on these topicsJeremy CorbynZarah SultananewsShareReuse this content"

I understand the tactic but not much use if we can’t do any work until they get recruitment sorted.”Meanwhile, the government is advertising for up to four new commissioners to join Stephenson. The EHRC, which is required by statute to have between 10 and 15 commissioners, now has just eight, all but one of whom was appointed during the last Conservative government.Deputy chair and Scotland commissioner Lesley Sawers and commissioner Joanne Cash will also finish their terms on 30 November. Akua Reindorf ends her term on 31 December.It is understood that some Labour MPs as well as figures in the wider policy sector believe the current impasse is a distraction from other pressing issues, including the rise of the far right and its impact on the communities served by the EHRC.They have been encouraging applications for the commissioner roles from those they feel take a more nuanced approach to trans inclusion.One Labour backbencher said: “As these posts are coming up, it’s important to have that broad range of experience and expertise on the board, and within those discussions we’ve been saying please do encourage people from the trans community to consider it, or have you thought of applying?“That broad range was essential from when EHRC was first set up but may have been narrowed with more political appointments under the Conservatives.“When a group of us met some of the current board members and the current chair, we felt very strongly that an understanding of the impact of the supreme court ruling on the trans community wasn’t there.”Another Labour backbencher said they hoped more people would apply: “We need commissioners with real world experience of the issues they grapple with.”Stonewall said the arrival of the new chair and commissioners was an opportunity “to rebuild an EHRC that re-establishes fairness, balance, and respect at its core”.CEO Simon Blake said: “We are living in a time of uncertainty and turbulence for many; this is an opportunity to review the strategic approach of our National Human Rights Institute so everyone – including trans people – can benefit from the rights and freedoms the EHRC is constituted to protect and defend.”But Susan Smith of ForWomenScotland called on Phillipson to “stop prevaricating” over approving the EHRC guidance.“Trying to frustrate the release of the code or attempting to force the EHRC to misrepresent the legislation will not change the supreme court’s judgment,” she said.“If MPs are unhappy they have the capacity to amend or repeal the Equality Act, but as the majority of voters supported the ruling, they may realise this would impact their prospects for re-election.“The minister needs to stop prevaricating and put this to bed once and for all. During this period of16 days of activism against gender-based violence, the government should remember that women are half the population and our human right to dignity, privacy, and safety matters.”An EHRC spokesperson said: “Appointments to our board of commissioners are made by the minister for women and equalities through the standard public appointment process.“Our commissioners come from all walks of life and bring with them a breadth of skills, expertise and experience.“This diversity helps us make impartial and independent decisions, and ensures we continue to uphold the rights of all people in Britain, including trans people.”Explore more on these topicsGenderWomen's rights and gender equalityTransgenderScotlandEquality Act 2010Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)WomennewsShareReuse this content"

Rage rooms are cropping up across the UK, allowing punters to smash seven bells out of old TVs, plates and furniture.Such pay-to-destroy ventures are thought to have originated in Japan in 2008,but have since gone global. In the UK alone venues can be found in locations from Birmingham to Brighton, with many promoting destruction as a stress-relieving experience.According toSmash It Rage Roomsin south-east London, where a 30-minute solo session costs £50, “each smash is a cathartic release, a burst of pure, primal joy”.“We are at capacity – we were looking for another venue because we can’t keep up with demand,” said Amelia Smewing, who set up the business with her husband after exploring ways to help their son cope with PTSD.Nicola Davis’s rage room experienceNicola Davis’s rage room experienceRob Clark, an operations director atUrban Xtreme Ltd, said the popularity of its Rage Room was growing year on year, with customers ranging from younger people looking for a unique experience, to groups of women celebrating break-ups, and people using the space as a “healthy outlet” for stress or mental health challenges.Clark said many customers were navigating tough personal challenges. “The feedback we get is consistently good – the Rage Room gives them a safe, constructive way to release pent-up anger and frustration, and it’s making a genuine difference to their mental wellbeing,” he said, adding several youth care homes regularly bring their teenagers, while a handful of therapists actively refer clients when traditional talking therapy is not enough.Rage rooms and primal screams: how stressed-out workers are letting off steamRead moreLucy Bee, the founder ofRage Rooms Leamington Spasaid her venue also hosted visits from schools and children’s homes. But people also just come for fun. “It’s so against how we’re conditioned to behave,” she said. “It is so naughty.”Like other venues, Bee said, the typical “rager” is female. “We’re talking early 40s, woman, a couple of kids, good job,” she said.Bee added that having trained as a holistic therapist she found many women experience guilt and shame over feeling angry.“A lot of women … are at breaking point, permanently teetering, living in survival mode. And this gives them a way to just let it out,” Bee said,adding that for some people who were struggling the experience could act as a gateway towards seeking further help.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So I don a protective outfit, pull down my visor and enter one of Bee’s rage rooms.Within seconds I am turning wine bottles into explosions of glass, laughing in surprise at myself. But I don’t enjoy the noise and am thinking more about the mess than experiencing a release.Experts, too, have qualms.Last year Dr Sophie Kjærvik, now at the Norwegian Center for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies in Oslo,co-authored a reviewinto what activities fuel or douse rage. She said the evidence suggested “venting” was actually counterproductive.“You’re activating your body in a way that your brain can interpret as that you’re getting more angry,” she said. “We found that doing meditation and mindfulness and muscle relaxation activities are way more productive ways of dealing with anger.” Kjærvik said cognitive behavioural therapy was also very efficient.Dr Ryan Martin, a dean at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay and an author of several books on anger, said people who relied on catharsis stayed angrier for longer, and were more likely to lash out aggressively after the fact. “I think the problem is it feels good, so people assume it’s good for them,” he said. “But at the same time, other things that we know might feel good when we’re emotional, like drinking, overeating, … aren’t necessarily good for us either.”Prof Brad Bushman of Ohio State University, who co-authored the review with Kjærvik, also raised concerns. “When people feed their anger in these rage rooms, they’re just practising how to behave more aggressively,” he said.Smewing emphasised that rage rooms were a conditioned environment. “Just because they’ve smashed up the air fryer at the rage room doesn’t mean they’re going to go home and smash up the air fryer in their kitchen,” she said.Suzy Reading, a chartered member of the British Psychological Society and author of the book How to be Selfish, said it was not that anger should not be expressed, but that there were many ways to do this, including writing and breathing exercises. Reading also said while rage rooms may offer an outlet for stress they cost money and did not provide insights into the causes of such feelings.“If there isn’t an understanding of what caused it, then we just go back into our home lives and our work lives and our communities, and nothing changes,” she said. “And for a lot of women, [the cause is] going to be unmet needs.”Reading said it could be important to move through some of the feelings of anger in order to have effective conversations. “We want to regulate our nervous system so that we can articulate well,” she said.Explore more on these topicsMental healthAnxietyPsychologyWomenHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

He also reposted a statement including the words: “hang them.”According to the site, “The Democrats and Fake News Media subversively implied that President Trump had issued illegal orders to service members. Every order President Trump has issued has been lawful. It is dangerous for sitting Members of Congress to incite insubordination in the United States’ military, and President Trump called for them to be held accountable.”Trump keeps insulting female journalists | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThe online page also features an “Offender Hall of Shame”, which includes the Washington Post, CBS News, CNN and MSNBC (now known as MS Now). Visitors can browse a searchable database of articles, along with the names of the journalists who wrote them. Each story is categorized under labels such as “bias”, “malpractice” or “left wing lunacy”.A leaderboard currently ranks the Washington Post as the top offender, with MSNBC and CBS News taking the second and third slots.Among the Washington Post articles named is areportfrom earlier this month that states the US Coast Guard would stop classifying swastikas and nooses as hate symbols, an action the Coast Guard reversed after the article was published.The Post acknowledged the quick reversal in afollow-uparticle. In itscoverageof the new tracker, the paper quoted an internal spokesperson who said: “The Washington Post is proud of its accurate, rigorous journalism.”Beyond those singled out as weekly offenders, the White House page also lists the Associated Press, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Politico and Axios among the long list of outlets it accuses of bias or misinformation.The launch of the webpage is the latest escalation in Trump’s long-running attacks on the media.

Prasad noted that these deaths appeared tied to myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle.“This is a profound revelation,” Prasad wrote in the memo to staff members. “For the first time, the US FDA will acknowledge that Covid-19 vaccines have killed American children.”He also wrote that new rules would impose tight restrictions on vaccines for pregnant women, marking another significant change in the agency’s approval framework.“I remain open to vigorous discussions and debate,” Prasad wrote, reportedly adding that staff who did not agree with the core principles of his new approach should submit their resignations.A PBS NewsHour correspondent first reported on the memo’s contents ina poston X. TheNew York Timesnoted that the document did not include identifying details such as the children’s ages, any existing health conditions, or how the causal relationship between vaccination and death was determined. The vaccine manufacturers involved were also not named.Dr Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who reviewed the memo, told MedPage Today that it was a “dangerous and irresponsible thing to do”.“[Prasad] says he has evidence that this vaccine killed 10 children, but that’s not the way it works,” Offit said. “If you think you have an extraordinary claim, you should back it up with extraordinary evidence. He should have submitted it to an excellent journal where it can be reviewed by subject matter experts who can say, ‘Yes, this is clear evidence,’ then it can be published. That’s the way it works.”Prasad’s predecessor, Dr Peter Marks, who led the FDA division throughout the pandemic, told theNew York Timesthat he was taken aback by the “clearly political tone of the communication” and noted that the case reports of child deaths needed to be further investigated.“I would not be surprised if the attributions turn out to be debatable, as these cases are often quite complex,” Marks told the Times after reading the memo.Current and former FDA staff, as well as outside public health specialists, said the new plan could dramatically slow the vaccine pipeline, according to theWashington Post. Requiring far larger studies before granting approvals, they said, could delay product launches and make companies more cautious about developing or expanding vaccines and may discourage innovation in vaccine research.Additionally, Prasad’s insistence on re-evaluating whether multiple vaccines should be given together could upend years of established federal guidance. The immunization schedule of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends giving multiple childhood vaccines at the same medical visit. It also encourages adults to receive several shots for respiratory viruses, including the flu, Covid and RSV, during a single appointment for convenience.Dr Kathryn Edwards, a vaccine expert and professor emeritus at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, told MedPage Today that the “determination of the cause of death in cases that are temporally related to vaccine administration is a very difficult task”.“Saying definitively that a vaccine caused a death requires careful assessment, best done with an autopsy examination, and ruling out other causes of death,” she said. “That Covid vaccine might have caused a death related to myocarditis may indeed be the case. But [we] would need to see the details.”Edwards added that such details would “best be presented in a peer-reviewed manuscript where experts could review the details”.“We also need to remember that Covid disease caused deaths [in kids], many more than 10,” she said. “I spent the entire pandemic reviewing cases of adverse events, I would be delighted to review these cases and assess the evidence that they have to say that they are vaccine caused.”Prasad’s new framework reflects several themes long advanced by Kennedy and members of the anti-vaccine movement, who have pressed for additional proof of vaccine safety and effectiveness. In August, the FDA placednew restrictionson who can get Covid vaccines.The agency authorized Covid vaccines for people 65 and older, who are known to be more at risk from serious illnesses from Covid infections. Younger people, though, were only considered to be eligible if they had an underlying medical condition that makes them particularly vulnerable.In September, Kennedy’s vaccine panel that advises the CDCvoted againstrecommending that people obtain a prescription for a Covid-19 vaccine, but added that coronavirus immunizations should be based on “individual-based decision making”.Last week, it was reported that Ralph Abraham, a top Louisiana health official who stopped promoting mass vaccination policies and once described Covid-19 vaccines as “dangerous”, had beenappointedas the new deputy director of the CDC.Previous FDA leaders and independent scientists have emphasized that Covid-19 vaccines underwent extensive testing, including pediatric studies, and have been provensafe and effective. They argue that the benefits of vaccination far exceed the risks, which remain rare.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The administration argued the school had not done enough to fight antisemitism.Under the agreement announced on Friday night, Northwestern will make the payment to the US treasury over the next three years. Among other commitments, it also requires the university to revoke the so-called Deering Meadow agreement, which it signed in April 2024 in exchange for pro-Palestinian protesters ending their tent encampment on campus.During negotiations, the interim university president, Henry Bienen, said Northwestern refused to cede control over hiring, admissions or its curriculum. “I would not have signed this agreement without provisions ensuring that is the case,” he said.The agreement also calls for Northwestern to continue compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws, develop training materials to “socialize international students” with the norms of a campus dedicated to open debate, and uphold a commitment to Title IX by “providing safe and fair opportunities for women, including single-sex housing for any woman, defined on the basis of sex, who requests such accommodations and all-female sports, locker rooms, and showering facilities”.The US education secretary, Linda McMahon, said the deal cemented policy changes that would protect people on campus from harassment and discrimination.“The reforms reflect bold leadership at Northwestern and they are a roadmap for institutional leaders around the country that will help rebuild public trust in our colleges and universities,” McMahon said.Trump has leveraged government control of federal research money to push for reforms at elite colleges he has decried as overrun by “woke” ideology.The fine agreed to by Northwestern is the second-largest behind Columbia, which agreed in July to pay the government $200m to resolve a series of investigations and restore its funding. Brown and Cornell also reached agreements with the government to restore funding following antisemitism investigations.Harvard, the administration’s primary target, remains in negotiations with the federal government over its demands for changes to campus policies and governance. The Ivy League school sued over the administration’s cuts to its grant money and won a court victory in September when a federal judge ordered the government to restore federal funding, saying the Trump administration “used antisemitism as a smokescreen”.This fall, the White House tried a different approach on higher education, offering preferential treatment for federal funds to several institutions in exchange for adopting policies in line with Trump’s agenda. The administration received a wave of initial rejections from some universities’ leadership, citing concerns that Trump’s higher education compact might supplant academic freedom.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Over the course of a friendly walk through the company offices, Karp fields no questions about Palantir’scontroversial ties to ICEbut instead extolls the company’s virtues, brandishes a sword and discusses how he exhumed the remains of his childhood dog Rosita to rebury them near his current home.“That’s really sweet,” host Molly O’Shea tells Karp.If you are looking to hear from some of tech’s most powerful people, you will increasingly find them on a constellation of shows and podcasts like Sourcery that provide a safe space for an industry that is wary, if not openly hostile, towards critical media outlets. Some of the new media outlets are created by the companies themselves. Others just occupy a specific niche that has found a friendly ear among the tech billionaire class like a remora on a fast-moving shark. The heads of tech’s largest companies, including Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Satya Nadella and more, have all sat for long, cozy interviews in recent months, while firms likePalantirand Andreessen Horowitz have branched out this year into creating their own media ventures.At a time when the majority ofAmericans distrustbig techandbelieve artificial intelligence will harm society, Silicon Valley has built its own network of alternative media where CEOs, founders and investors are the unchallenged and beloved stars. What was once the province of a few fawning podcasters has grown into a fully fledged ecosystem of publications and shows supported by some of the tech industry’s most powerful.While pro-tech influencers like podcast host Lex Fridman have for years formed a symbiotic relationship with tech elites like Elon Musk, some firms have decided this year to cut out the middleman entirely. In September, the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz announced that it had launched an a16z blog on Substack. One of its prominent writers, investor Katherine Boyle, hasa longstanding friendshipwith JD Vance. Its podcast has meanwhile grown to more than 220,000 subscribers on YouTube, and last month hosted OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, whocounts Andreessen Horowitzas a major investor.“What if the future of media isn’t controlled by algorithms or legacy institutions, but by independent voices building directly with their audiences?” the firm wrote in its Substack announcement. The firm once invested $50m in the digital media upstart BuzzFeed with a similar vision, only to see it fall into penny stock territory.The a16z Substack also announced this month that the firm was launching an eight-week new media fellowship for “operators, creators, and storytellers shaping the future of media”. The fellowship includes collaborating with a16z’s new media operation, which it describes as being made up of “online legends” creating a “single place where founders acquire the legitimacy, taste, brandbuilding, expertise, and momentum they need to win the narrative battle online”.In addition to a16z’s media effort, Palantir launched a digital and print publication earlier this year called the Republic that mimics academic journals and thinktank-style magazines like Foreign Affairs. The journal is funded by the Palantir Foundation for Defense Policy and International Affairs, a non-profit of which Karp is the chair, though he only works there 0.01 hours per week, according to 2023 tax filings.“Far too many people who should not have a platform do. And there are far too many people who should have a platform but do not,” states the Republic, which has an editorial team made up of senior Palantir executives.A sampling of the articles the Republic has published includes an essay arguing that US copyright law restrictions will prevent US AI dominance and another from two Palantir employees on how Silicon Valley working with the military is good for society, a point Karp has himself mademany times.The Republic joins a burgeoning set of pro-tech publications like Arena magazine, which was founded late last year by the Austin-based venture capitalist Max Meyer. The outlet takes its motto, “The New Needs Friends”, from Disney’s film Ratatouille.“At Arena, we don’t cover ‘the news.’ We cover The New,” a letter from the editors stated in its inaugural issue. “Our mission at Arena is to cheer on the people who are, slowly but surely – and sometimes very quickly! – bringing the future into the present.”The letter echoes a sentiment shared by its founder, who has criticized publications like Wired and TechCrunch for being too critical in their coverage of the industry.“The magazines that have historically covered this area are just super negative now. By being bold and positive, we’re going to battle with them,” Meyer told Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of Palantir, on the latter’s podcast.Some parts of tech’s new media scene have also grown more organically, rather than being created as an official corporate media arm – even if the optimistic overall tone is similar. The TBPN video podcast, which reimagines tech industry minutiae like hirings as a high-stakes drama akin to an NFL draft, has rapidly grown in influence since launching late last year. The show’s self-aware yet pro-tech vibe has attracted prominent fans and guests, including Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, who gave an in-person interview in September to promote Meta’s smart glasses.Another podcaster, 24-year-old Dwarkesh Patel, has similarly built out a miniature media empire in recent years through long, collegial interviews with tech leaders and researchers about artificial intelligence. Earlier this month Patel talked with Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, who gave him a tour of one of the company’s newest datacenters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since the billionaire bought Twitter in 2022, the company has throttled links to critical news outlets and set up autoreplies that return poop emojis when reporters reach out for comment. He has seldom given interviews to established media outlets, but appears for long sit-downs with sympathetic hosts like Lex Fridman and Joe Rogan, in which his opinions go largely unchallenged.Musk’s embrace of creating a media bubble around himself has also shown how detached this kind of content can become from reality and result in the pursuit of alternative facts. The billionaire’s longstanding discontent with Wikipedia led him this year to create the AI knockoff Grokipedia, whichgenerates blatant falsehoodsand results that fit his own far-right worldview. Musk’s chatbot Grok has meanwhile repeatedly expressed opinions that mirror the billionaire’s own opinions orgo to ludicrous lengths to flatter him, including last week claiming that he was fitter than LeBron James and could beat Mike Tyson in a boxing match.The rise of tech’s new media is also part of a larger shift in how public figures are presenting themselves and the level of access they are willing to give journalists. The tech industry has a long history of being sensitive around media and closely guarded about their operations, a tendency that has intensified following scandals likethe Facebook filesthat have exposed internal documents and potential harms. In one example of how skittish some in tech have become around negative press, journalist Karen Haowrites in her 2025 book, Empire of AI, that OpenAI did not officially speak to her for three years following a critical profile she did on the company in 2019.Tech’s move towards sympathetic outlets and in-house media creation also mirrors a strategy the entertainment industry took on years ago. Film and album release press tours have long been tightly controlled affairs, where actors and musicians go through a gauntlet of easily vetted, low-stakes interviews on shows like Hot Ones. Politicians have embraced a similar model – as was evident during Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign tour of podcasters like Theo Von, or California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, launching his own politics podcast earlier this year – which offers them both access to new audiences and a safer space for self-promotion.Even if much of this new media isn’t aiming to expose wrongdoing or challenge people in power, it is not exactly without value. The content that the tech industry is creating is frequently a reflection of how its elites see themselves and the world they want to build – one with less government regulation and fewer probing questions on how their companies are run. Even the most banal questions can also be a glimpse into the heads of people who exist primarily in guarded board rooms and gated compounds.“If you were a cupcake, what cupcake would be?” O’Shea asked Karp on Sourcery presented by Brex.“I don’t want to be a cupcake because I don’t want to be eaten,” Karp said. “I’m resisting becoming a cupcake.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Harmeet Dhillon, a lawyer whohelped advanceDonald Trump’s claims of a stolen election in 2020, now leads the civil rights division of the justice department. An election denier, Heather Honey,now serves asthe deputy assistant secretary for election integrity in the Department of Homeland Security. Kurt Olsen, an attorney involved in the “stop the steal” movement, is now a special government employeeinvestigating the 2020 election.A movement that once pressured elected officials to bend to its whims is now part of the government.“The call is literally coming from inside the house,” said Joanna Lydgate, co-founder and chief executive officer of the States United Democracy Center. “Now it has its tentacles in the White House, in Congress and federal agencies, and with outside groups really feeding into that infrastructure.”The Trump administration is going after states with dubious requests for voter data that could ensnare qualified voters and will serve as an underpinning for future claims of fraud. They are working to install rules that limit voter access or sow seeds of distrust in who can vote and how. Trump has put federal agents in cities around the country,raising fearsthat officers could be tapped for election purposes.“All of this, while focused on past elections, is misdirection about what the actual intention likely is, which is to interfere with the 2026 elections and attempt to delegitimize them if the president’s party doesn’t do well,” said David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research. The results of the 2025 off-year elections, in which Democrats saw big wins, probably “strengthen the administration’s resolve to interfere in state elections and to further spread doubt about outcomes”, he said.Some state and local elections officials say they no longer have working relationships with the federal government and do not trust the expertise they used to tap into on election security.“The federal government is no longer a trusted partner in democracy,” Jena Griswold, the Democratic secretary of state in Colorado, told the Guardian.Arizona’s secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, said: “There would have to be a significant shift in the rhetoric and the attitude coming out of senior leadership in the administration before I open my door and say, ‘Yeah, you guys, come on in.’ It’d be foolish of me to let the fox into the henhouse.”Asked for comment, the White House did not address questions about what authority Trump believes he has over elections or whether he would use emergency powers to take control of elections, as election experts fear he may.What have they done with their power?Trump’s 2024 win ignited the promotion of election denialism, both in the administration of the president known to reward loyalty and in outside groups that had long been lobbying for new laws and policies that fit with their false claims of rampant election fraud.On the first day of Trump’s term, he granted clemency to all those who stormed the Capitol in the January 6 insurrection. By November, he issued dozens of pre-emptive pardons for those involved in a fake electors scheme and other attempts to subvert the 2020 elections results. Ed Martin, a stop the steal activist, has assisted with pardons.Lydgate, of States United, said the administration’s strategy on elections was “death by 1,000 cuts, with the goal of making sure that this group of election deniers can get the results that they want”.The three key pillars of the strategy, she said, were taking power away from nonpartisan elections officials, overwhelming election administrators with frivolous work and threats, and attempting to shape the electorate in their favor by removing voters from the rolls.“There have always been political leaders who complain about the results of elections, but not in this way where you are trying to discredit the entire system and that you’re channeling the resources of the federal government in furtherance of that measure,” said Derek Tisler, counsel and manager in the Brennan Center’s elections and government program.Election activistshelped draft a billthat would require people to prove their citizenship in order to vote. When the US House passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (Save) Act, Cleta Mitchell, the leader of an influential “election integrity” group, waspresented withthe vote count card.When Trump issued an executive order in March about “preserving and protecting the integrity of American elections”, it appeared similar to a “US Citizens Elections Bill of Rights” that Mitchell had promoted, with both calling for documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote. Much of the executive order has been stalled by the courts.The quest for widespread citizenship verification among election activists convinced that high numbers of non-citizens are voting led to an expanded, controversial use of a system intended to screen for citizenship for public benefits, not voting. The Trump administration has said itexpanded the serviceto search more databases and allow election officials to search for people in large batches instead of individually. Officialsreportedlybriefed Mitchell’s group to explain the new uses. Voting rights groupshave suedover this expansion.Mitchell declined to comment.Another election denier obsession – “cleaning” rolls they allege hold scores of invalid voters, despite regular and careful maintenance by elections officials – now has the force of the federal government behind it. The justice department has sought the voter rolls of dozens of states in aneffortto amass a national voter roll, the purpose of which is not clear.Some states have refused to turn this over, citing voter privacy concerns and a lack of clarity. Voting rights experts and elections officials fear the administration will use the database, which is near-certain to be incomplete, to kick off fishing expeditions on past or future fraud claims.A justice department spokesperson said the agency had authority to ensure states have “proper voter registration procedures and programs to maintain clean voter rolls containing only eligible voters in federal elections”. Data sent to the department as part of requests for voter rolls “is being screened for ineligible voter entries”, the spokesperson said.“Clean voter rolls and basic election safeguards are requisites for free, fair, and transparent elections,” Dhillon said in a statement. “The DOJ Civil Rights Division has a statutory mandate to enforce our federal voting rights laws, and ensuring the voting public’s confidence in the integrity of our elections is a top priority of this administration.”Harming relationships with statesIt’s not just the active steps the Trump administration has taken to empower election deniers. The administration has also weakened its expertise on cybersecurity and elections, even compared with the first Trump administration.Election disinformation researchandforeign interference workhas been disbanded. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) has seenmassive cuts.Becker, of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, said he had spoken to election officials in both parties who do not trust the federal government as a partner on elections right now, in “stark contrast” to the firstTrump administration.“In addition to the affirmative action of hiring conspiracy theorists into the federal government, there’s this additional negative action of dismantling the positive things the federal government had done in the past,” he said.The Department of Homeland Security said in response to concerns about Cisa’s diminished role: “Unlike the previous administration, Cisa is focused squarely on executing its statutory mission: serving as the national coordinator for securing and protecting the nation’s critical infrastructure and is delivering timely, actionable cyber threat intelligence, supporting federal, state, and local partners, and defending against both nation-state and criminal cyber threats.”States are starting to take on more roles that the federal government would have assisted with. Fontes said the federal government used to provide intelligence and technical advice, and that he had a direct line to the former head of Cisa for any concerns. This year, his office has had “almost no interactions whatsoever” with the federal government.“It’s like playing regular football, but you’ve only got an eight-man team,” he said. “We no longer have a partner. It feels like we have an adversary, and that’s not a healthy way to govern.”Because Trump doesn’t have authority over election administration, he will rely on his allies in state and local election roles to carry out his orders, said Samantha Tarazi, co-founder and chief executive officer of Voting Rights Lab.“In the ways that you’re seeing more high-profile election deniers in positions in the federal government, you have to also keep in mind that the benches are currently also being stacked at the more grassroots level, in county boards and state boards of elections, for example,” Tarazi said.In some places – including the Georgia state elections board and county boards in Arizona – activists already hold positions with election oversight. And a high-profile election challenge in North Carolina, where a Republican who lost a judicial election tried to disqualify voters after the fact, served as a test case for how elections could be challenged in future.What this means for the midtermsIn the lead up to the midterms, these efforts to undermine elections will intensify, and claims will heat up that Democrats or the courts are trying to prevent the Trump administration from putting rules in place to protect elections – all part of a plan to undermine results if Republicans lose. Attempts to limit access to voting and remove voters from the rolls will expand in 2026 as well.There will be pressure campaigns on local officials to put policies in place that Trump cannot legally install himself. If his candidates lose, he and his allies will pressure local officials not to certify results or to issue voter challenges. In short, 2026 could look a lot like 2020, depending on who wins.Election denial activists want Trump to go further: some have called on him to declare a national emergency to stake claim over elections. Mitchell acknowledged on a podcast earlier this year that the president’s authority in elections is limited – “except where there is a threat to the national sovereignty of the United States”.US senators have warned of the threat of a national emergency on voting, citing Trump’s hiring of election deniers in prominent roles and their potential to influence the administration.“From day one, Donald Trump has worked to undermine our free and fair elections. He has stacked his team with election deniers like Ed Martin, Kurt Olsen, and Heather Honey, whose extremist playbook is clear: push Trump to declare a fake ‘national emergency’ to meddle in state elections because they know Republicans cannot win on their record,” California Democratic senator, Alex Padilla, said in a statement.The courts serve as a “significant limiting factor” to Trump’s ability to steal an election, just as they did in 2020, Becker said. The decentralized nature of elections in the US also makes it hard to overturn results. But the chaos already being sown is more extreme than it was last time.“There’s no question in my mind that there is a potential for political pressure to be exerted against election administrators,” Fontes said. “And my call to election administrators, not just here in Arizona but across the nation, is to stay strong. Just do your job.”Explore more on these topicsUS elections 2020Trump administrationUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The objective was to lay down building blocks for the region to transition from extractive industries like coal and timber to a hub for solar and other advanced energy technologies, with a view to long-term economic, climate and social resilience.But on his first day in office,Donald Trumpscrapped Biden’s clean energy and environmental programs, which he lambasted as woke, anti-American liberal hoaxes.“We knew we were living in a historic moment, not just because of the amount of funding, but because the whole region mobilized to meet the moment,” said Hannah, 33. “It was a once-in-a-generation cash injection designed to prioritize extraction-based communities as part of the energy transition, which for the first time in almost a century made Appalachia very competitive. So to have it all taken away is deeply damaging and demoralizing.”Hannah, a fifth-generation Appalachian with a bushy beard and signature wide-brimmed hat, has been crisscrossing the country on a mission to raise philanthropic capital to limit the economic damage caused by the Trump administration taking a chainsaw to Biden-era grants.Hannah runs Coalfield Development, a non-profit organization headquartered in Huntington, focused on rebuilding south-west Virginia’s economy and social fabric through workforce training, job creation and revitalizing abandoned buildings and mines in some of the most forgotten corners of coal country.View image in fullscreenPeople shop at the Wild Ramp, a non-profit local farmers’ market.Photograph: Michael Swensen/The GuardianCoalfield Development has trained more than 4,000 people – including many formerly incarcerated and/or in addiction recovery – over the past 15 years in everything from solar installation to drywalling and first aid. Yet, historically, federal grants for community regeneration efforts in Appalachia have been mostly top-down, project-based and short-lived.The 2022 cash injection came through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Biden’s landmark climate and infrastructure legislation, and was designed to help revitalize and strengthen former coal communities over the long haul.It was the largest investment in Appalachia since the 1960s’ “war on poverty” under Lyndon Johnson.In response, Coalfield Development spearheaded a coalition of universities, unions, non-profits, businesses and local governments to create collective infrastructure and capacity, enabling coal-affected rural communities across the US access to more than $900m of the historic IRA investment.Rural communities in Appalachia were on the verge of breaking ground on projects when the grants were paused or terminated by the so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, led by the billionaire Trump donor Elon Musk. The wholesale cull included the $3bn Environmental and Climate Justice Program created in the IRA to tackle the climate crisis and environmental harms at a local level.A few grants have since been reinstated, but are subject to long delays – in part because so many staff at federal agencies were forced out by Doge. Many remain the subject of litigation. Every single grant Coalfield Development was helping coordinate has been affected in some way.View image in fullscreenKalob Smith removes mud from the tracks of an excavator.Photograph: Michael Swensen/The GuardianThe cuts have deepened existing mistrust in government, known colloquially as Appalachian fatalism, yet many of those interviewed by the Guardian blame Washington politics generally rather than Trump.“This party has taken away that funding from Appalachia illegally: that’s the stone-cold fact. But by the time those facts reach communities on the ground, it’s just so muddy. I think some are asking questions about why training is being shut down and why they didn’t get their Snap [food assistance] benefits, but where they’ll find the answers is the big issue,” said Hannah.Huntington, the second largest city inWest Virginiawith 45,000 residents, was perhaps a perfect place to build a coalition for the massive IRA investment across coal country. Located on the Ohio river, it was once a major transportation hub for the region’s coalfields, but suffered major economic and social decline as the surrounding mines shut down – and then became an epicenter of the opioid epidemic.It sits at the heart of the Bible belt, which once voted loyally with Democrats but like many blue-collar regions is now part of the loyal Maga base who believed Trump when he pledged to resuscitate coal country and put American first.Trump has won big in West Virginia in the past three general elections, securing every county in 2024 with an average of 70% of the vote – the highest percentage any party has won in the state’s history. His vote share was even larger in rural counties including Clay and Wayne, which Huntington straddles.View image in fullscreenA person walks through an empty lot in Huntington, West Virginia. Once a major transportation hub for coalfields, Huntington experienced economic and social decline after mines shut down.Photograph: Michael Swensen/The GuardianThe Guardian’s visit coincided with the Democrats drubbing the Republicans in several state elections – including the governor’s race in Virginia.It was also five weeks into the government shutdown, just days after the Trump administration announced that millions of Americans would not receive food stamps and Tesla shareholders approved a trillion-dollar pay package for Musk.The damage caused by Trump’s dismantling of Biden-era programs was visible all around Coalfield Development’s redbrick office, which is located in a former manufacturing hub between the rail tracks and the river.Next door, a multimillion-dollar redevelopment of a sprawling industrial site known as the Black Diamond warehouse has stalled – at first due to grant suspensions, and more recently due to the federal shutdown slowing down payments. Coalfield Development is still waiting for close to $3m in overdue reimbursements.The warehouse, which once manufactured military planes, jeeps and coal trains, is being repurposed as a hub for sustainable industries and training. But all six EPA grants for Reuse Corridor, a new social enterprise to salvage and repurpose mattresses, electronics and other materials frequently dumped in the Ohio River, were cut, effectively killing the business and with it countless job opportunities.View image in fullscreenJacob Hannah, CEO of Coalfield Development, walks towards the Black Diamond warehouse.Photograph: Michael Swensen/The GuardianMeanwhile, Solar Holler, a solar developer and installation company with 105 employees across Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio and Virginia, signed up for a new office in the warehouse as the business had been growing 20 to 30% annually.But tax incentives for residential solar, which accounted for 70% of the company’s business, will be axed at the end of this year thanks to Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget. Commercial tax breaks will end in late 2027.Solar Holler uses panels made in Georgia, yet Trump’s tariffs and other trade restrictions have caused supply chain delays and pushed up raw material prices across the board, as well as almost doubling the cost of solar energy on the market. The company’s forecast for 2026 is down from 30% to “roughly flat”.“The massive increase in costs ends up being passed down to customers,” said Dan Conant, founder and CEO of Solar Holler. “The IRA rollbacks are obviously disappointing but that said, no matter how hard you make it on the ground for people, solar is the cheapest form of power on the planet so it’s going to happen one way or the other.”Appalachian Voices (AV) is a non-profit working with local communities – and in Washington – on securing a just energy transition. In 2023, AV, which is part of the broader coalition with Coalfield Development, was awarded a half-million-dollar EPA grant to help five former coal communities in Virginia increasingly being hit by severe floods thanks to the climate crisis and the environmental legacy of mining.The grant was among those summarily terminated by Doge. It remains the subject of class-action litigationbrought by 350 groups, tribes and local governmentswho claim the wholesale termination of the $3bn environmental justice and climate program is unconstitutional.In Lee county, where 85% of people voted for Trump and almost half rely on food stamps, AV had earmarked $40,000 for an asbestos survey in Pennington Gap. This was among a stack of grants secured by the community to demolish a derelict supermarket – a concrete asbestos-ridden eyesore that frequently floods and cuts off neighborhoods from the main town – to create a green space that would mitigate against future flooding.For small communities such as Pennington Gap, securing funding for revitalization projects is like a game of Jenga, and removing just one or two pieces can make the whole stack collapse, according to Emma Kelly, AV’s New Economy program manager.“People in Appalachia are used to being let down by the government, but this time we had the money. It was still taken away, and people feel betrayed.”View image in fullscreenA view of the town center in Pennington Gap, Virginia, in this 2016 photo.Photograph: Thomas Cordy/AlamyA Department of Energy grant that the community hoped to use to install rooftop solar on public buildings that would save $400 or so in monthly energy bills – a reliable income source that could be reinvested in sustainability projects such as communal fruit trees and electric bikes – was also cut.“Regardless of who’s in power, there’s a lot of finger-pointing, while life gets worse for the common people and the oligarch class keep winning,” said Orville Overton, 34, a local business owner and member of the residents’ council. “I don’t think people know who or what to trust, because both [political] parties have failed us in big ways.”About 60 miles east, Dante, a sparsely populated former integrated mining community that was once the second largest in Russell county, suffers frequent power outages – including a four-day blackout during a major flood in July, and nine days after Hurricane Helene in August 2024.Dante’s share of the terminated EPA grant was tagged for a feasibility study on the old railway depot, once the hub of mining operations and the whole town. This is the first step needed to convert the depot into a resilience hub with solar panels and battery storage, a place for residents to charge their phones and keep medication refrigerated during the next blackout.The post office has been closed since July, due to flood damage. The only place still open for business in Dante is the volunteer-run mining museum.Dante is also currently without a fire station, after nearly $400,000 appropriated by Congress to replace the one demolished due to subsidence was rescinded by the Trump administration.View image in fullscreenFlooding in Dante, Virginia in July 2025.

And when you work hard for two or three years to secure federal funds, you expect it to be delivered,” said Lou Ann Wallace, Dante’s representative on the Republican-controlled Russell county board of supervisors.“I don’t think the president knew. I’m one of his biggest supporters, but we’re dealing with the ills of industry here, and we’ve got to be able to clean this up so our people in these hollers can have a quality of life.”Trump won 83% of the vote in Russell county in 2024 while Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican candidate for governor, secured 81% last month.Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said: “President Trump cares about our miners more than any other president in modern history – which is why he has implemented his energy dominance agenda to protect their jobs and revive the mining industry … we can maintain the safety of miners while simultaneously rolling back Joe Biden’s Green New Scam regulations that were killing their jobs.”Across Appalachia, people who believe in Trump will be hit hard by his wholesale cuts to Medicaid, veterans affairs, food aid and education among other public services. Simultaneously, the region is scrambling to save projects that would improve resilience and bring jobs.View image in fullscreenA mural on a building, recognizing coal’s history in Dante, Virginia.Photograph: James Talalay/AlamyIt’s a race against the clock, according to Hannah, to find enough money to keep afloat and help people keep faith.“The funding was committed by Congress, so we know the law’s on our side, and that we will eventually win back some of these grants,” Hannah said. “One objective was probably to remove confidence in the system, so we need to outlast what is a game of cashflow and the battle of morale.”Explore more on these topicsCoalDonald TrumpWest VirginiaVirginiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the time Airbus issued its bulletin to the plane’s more than 350 operators, about 3,000 A320-family jets were in the air.The recall came over the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, but Delta said it expected the issue to affect fewer than 50 of its A321neo aircraft. United said six planes in its fleet were affected and it expected minor disruptions to a few flights. Hawaiian Airlines said it was unaffected.The world’s largest A320 operator, American Airlines, said 209 of its 480 A320 aircraft would need the fix. It said it mostly expected these to be completed by Saturday, with about two hours required for each plane.In Australia, Jetstarcancelled 90 flights, with 34 of 85 of the company’s A320/1 aircraft identified as having the problem, leaving thousands of Australians stranded at airports around the country. Affected customers documented long queues at airports on social media.ANA Holdings, Japan’s biggest airline, said it had cancelled 65 flights on Saturday after the recall forced it to ground some aircraft. The carrier, along with affiliates such as Peach Aviation, is the biggest operator in Japan of single-aisle Airbus aircraft, including the A320.All Nippon Airways, which operates more than 30 planes, cancelled 65 domestic flights for Saturday. Additional cancellations on Sunday were possible, it said.Other airlines said they would take planes briefly out of service to do the repairs, including Germany’s Lufthansa, India’s IndiGo and UK-based easyJet. Kuwait’s Jazeera Airways and Air Arabia also said their planes were affected.The Colombian flag carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70% of its fleet, prompting it to close ticket sales for travel dates until 8 December and warn of “significant disruptions over the next 10 days”.TheDirectorate General of Civil Aviationin India has told airlines not to fly A320s until modifications are carried out under the EASA directive. Air India said some of its flights might be delayed or rescheduled.The Guardian understands that only three of BA’s short-haul aircraft are affected and it does not expect any operational impact while they are undergoing the software updates.EasyJet had said it was expecting some disruption on Friday evening but later confirmed it was planning to operate as normal on Saturday because it had already completed the software update on many required aircraft.A spokesperson for Gatwick airport said a small number of its airlines were affected, while Heathrow said it was not affected as of late Friday night.Airbus said in a statement on Friday that a recent incident involving an A320-family aircraft had revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls.Industry sources said the incident that triggered the unexpected repair action involved a JetBlue flight from Cancún, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, on 30 October, in which several passengers were hurt after a sudden drop in altitude.JetBlue had no immediate comment.At least 15 JetBlue passengers were injured and taken to the hospital after the October incident, and the plane was diverted to Tampa, Florida.The bulletin seen by Reuters traced the problem to a flight system called the elevator and aileron computer (ELAC), which sends commands from the pilot’s side-stick to elevators at the rear. These in turn control the aircraft’s pitch or nose angle.The manufacturer, France’s Thales, said in response to a Reuters query that the computer complies with Airbus specifications and the functionality in question is supported by software that is not under Thales’s responsibility.The recall comes a time of intense demands on airline repair shops, already plagued by shortages of maintenance capacity and the grounding of hundreds of Airbus jets as a result of long waiting times for separate engine repairs or inspections.The UK’s transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: “The good news is it seems the impact on UK airlines seems limited, with a smaller number of aircraft requiring more complex software and hardware changes.”There are about 11,300 A320-family aircraft in operation worldwide, including 6,440 of the core A320 model, which first flew in 1987.With Reuters and Associated PressExplore more on these topicsAirbusAirline industryAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

But many aren’t holding their breath.“My husband and I have invested a lot of our retirement money into this business,” Joann Cartiglia, owner of Queen’s Treasures, a toy company in Ticonderoga, New York, during a press briefing organized by We Pay the Tariffs, a coalition of small businesses, this week. “And now I have absolutely no hope of retirement.”Americans are feeling the pain of the affordability crisis: ‘There’s not any wiggle room’Read more“I honestly feel the government is putting me out of business,” added Cartiglia, 64.Lawsuits,opposition frombig business, and pleas for help from small importers have failed to persuade the Trump administration to reconsider its aggressive strategy on trade from overseas, which the US president claims will raise trillions of dollars for the federal government.Opponents of tariffs are “serving hostile foreign interests”, Trump hasclaimed.The tariff rates of various holiday goods have risen in the past yearSmall businesses, particularly in the retail industry, typicallyrely heavilyon the holiday trading season, but are grappling with increased costs, supply chain disruption, logistical issues and uncertainty due to tariffs.Tariffs have hit some small businesses especially hard, as they often have smaller margins – and are less able to absorb costs, or secure exemptions – than bigger firms.Jared Hendricks has run Village Lighting Co in West Valley City, Utah, which specializes in holiday lights and decorations, for over 20 years. He estimates his tariff costs are approaching $1m so far this year.“At this point, we’ve kind of transitioned from working for profits to working for tariffs,” said Hendricks. “We are just in business to pay off our tariff debt.”But some operators anticipate that the problem is likely to get worse.“Whatever price increases you’re seeing in the holiday industry for your Christmas trees, for your lighting, for your other decor, this year will be small compared to next year, if tariff relief isn’t given for the 2026 season,” added Hendricks. “American manufacturing has never done Christmas goods, so it’s not responsible for taking away any jobs.“The supply chain for Christmas items is simply too complex, and [it] would take billions of dollars in decades to build that infrastructure to move that production here. And then, even if you did, the workforce is not sufficient to support it.”Boyd Stephenson, owner of Game Kastle College Park in College Park, Maryland, said the firm’s costs had soared due to the tariffs. “Most of my manufacturers and publishers don’t really have the space to absorb, or to pass on price increases to their customers, so they’re getting squeezed,” he said. “The number of toy and game studios that I have seen go under this year is massive.“Up until a month ago, I’d be saying: ‘Hey, most of the federal workforce isn’t employed either, so we’re hunkering down for a terrifying holiday season.’ But we’re still pretty scared, even with the shutdown being over.”Asurveyof 1,048 small businesses conducted by Small Business for America’s Future found 71% of small business owners expect tariffs to have a negative impact on consumer spending this holiday season, and 44% expect a very negative impact.About 44% of small businesses surveyed reported raising prices due to tariffs, and 74% reported being worried about their business surviving over the next 12 months.“The administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world’s biggest and best consumer market,” said a White House spokesperson, Kush Desai. “As tariffs secure new trade deals and trillions in investments to make and hire in America, the administration is simultaneously implementing a pro-growth agenda of tax cuts, deregulation, and energy abundance for big and small businesses alike to thrive again as they did during President Trump’s first term.”.Explore more on these topicsSmall businessTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

In short order, Thomas Frank is running through the gamut of his predecessors, from hope to disappointment to what now resembles hopelessness.Demolition by Arsenalhad already created a sticky wicket. Adecent midweek showing in Paris, though another defeat, had barely increased the credit rating. Losing to Fulham, a team with a previous away record as miserable as Spurs’ home form, intensified the pressure. That Frank was appointed by the departed stewardship of Daniel Levy is to be noted; fresh ownership regimes tend to be trigger-happy with inherited managers.‘Not true Tottenham fans’: boos for goalkeeper Vicario anger Thomas FrankRead moreShould such a decision be made, and it still seems a premature outcome considering Frank made slow starts at his previous clubs, Marco Silva, linked previously on a couple of occasions, would be a live contender. By six minutes in, Silva was cavorting on the sidelines with his Fulham staff. His team were 2-0 up and the home fans were baying for blood. By the final whistle, theTottenham HotspurStadium emptied, the mood was even lower, Frank’s outlook even bleaker.The damage was done early on. Following neat skills from Samuel Chukwueze, Pedro Porro and Archie Gray tied in knots, Kenny Tete was given space and grace to score, via a deflection off Destiny Udogie. Two minutes later Guglielmo Vicario’s mis-kick from way outside his own area, the Italian heading out on a wholly unscheduled safari, had been diverted to Harry Wilson by Josh King. Wilson guided his lob beautifully, the keeper stranded. “I saw the keeper was in a sticky situation,” said Wilson.“That gave us the confidence and the boost we needed,” said Silva, celebrating Fulham’s first win at Tottenham since Martin Jol pulled off a revenger’s win in 2013. “I am not here to analyse them, it’s not for me. Football is about risk and we took it.”Vicario’s next attempts to clear his lines were jeered. “They can’t be true Tottenham fansbecause everyone supports each other when you’re on the pitch,” said Frank, veering into the territory of lighting the blue touch paper.Fulham’s previous haul from six away games had been the single point collected on the opening day at Brighton. For Tottenham, their attacking style was kryptonite, rather like most visiting teams’. Spurs’ last home victory came that same opening weekend; only Manchester United, Southampton and Burnley have lost there in thePremier Leaguein 2025.As Frank raged impotently on the sidelines, Chukwueze, making an impressive first league start, hit a post; where Tottenham were disastrous, Fulham were devastating. “Chukwu-magic – that’s his nickname in the training field,” said Alex Iwobi of his fellow Nigerian.View image in fullscreenRicharlison, Pedro Porro, Randal Kolo Muani and Guglielmo Vicario show their disappointment at half-time.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersThe Parisian promise of a partnership between Richarlison and Randal Kolo Muani was far less encouraging in London. Silva had been watching on Wednesday. “I think we controlled that situation well,” he said. Spurs players departed at half-time with boos rattling the rafters and returned to a half-empty stadium, fans paying high prices favouring warmth over misery. Those of an xG persuasion would have noted a flatlining score of 0.07 for the first half.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fulham, perhaps mindful of their previous travel sickness, began to retreat and Mohammed Kudus’s goal, smashed with his right foot, Bernd Leno’s response unconvincing, set up 30 minutes for Spurs to save the match, and possibly Frank’s job.On came Wilson Odobert, Xavi Simons and Rodrigo Bentancur, and chances at last piled up, Raúl Jiménez clearing off the line from Lucas Bergvall’s flicked header. Fulham, meanwhile, ran down the clock to take the sting from opposition whose renewed strength of purpose was curbed by a lack of coherency.Nobody could find sufficient inspiration for a revival mission that eventually flagged in tandem with the spirits of Tottenham fans. “We are in a tough spell right now and for my players it is about being as calm as possible and doing everything we can to work through it,” said Frank. The inspirational figure he cut at Brentford has found little constituency at Tottenham.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Australian responded well in Qatar and delivered an impressive run to take the top spot with his final lap, one that had to be inch-perfect after Norris had laid down a strong marker in a tightly fought qualifying contest.It was as good a day behind the wheel as Piastri has enjoyed since he last won, at the Dutch GP in August, which was also the last time he claimed pole. Piastri won the sprint race with a dominant drive and with Norris only third it was a vital boost to the Australian’s title ambitions, while Verstappen took fourth place dropping a point to the championship leading Briton.“Let’s go, baby!” Piastri declared over the radio after winning the sprint.With victory in the 19-lap dash, Piastri narrowed the gap to Norris by two points to 22, while Verstappen fell one point further behind, to 25 in arrears.Norris still holds the cards and can seal the championship on Sunday. He must be 26 points ahead of Piastri and Verstappen. If either of his rivals are closer than that margin then the title will be decided in Abu Dhabi. A win in the race would be enough for Norris regardless of any other results and he will also take the title if he outscores Piastri by four points and finishes ahead of Verstappen in any position.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri on his way to pole in Qatar.Photograph: David Davies/PAPiastri’s pole could be vital in taking the title to Abu Dhabi. The high-speed Lusail circuit, with its sequences of fast corners, is notoriously hard for overtaking, as was demonstrated in the sprint race. Drivers finding it hard to close or to enjoy a sufficient speed advantage to make a pass through corners that are taken flat-out.If Piastri can keep his nose in front after the long drag to the first corner, in what will be a mandated two-stop race making strategies likely to converge, he will have every shot at controlling the race to the flag and taking the title to the wire.He knows he is fighting to stay in the game but finally was able to enjoy his performance after what has been a late-season slump. “Winning is a lot more fun than whatever the hell happened the last four or five races, that’s for sure,” he said. “You always try and enjoy it. When you look at the bigger picture, even in the last few weeks that have been tough I’m still driving probably the fastest car or one of the fastest cars there’s ever been in the world and I love all of that.”Norris had looked on course to deny his teammate when, at the sharp end in Q3, he opened the running with a roaring lap, his best of the day, with a time of 1min 19.495sec. Piastri pushed hard but could not quite match it at just three-hundredths down.Norris had the advantage entering the final laps and once more led the way but he went slightly wide at turn two, a small error but enough to make him abort his lap and it was costly.View image in fullscreenLando Norris will start Sunday’s grand prix from second on the grid.Photograph: Florent Gooden/DPPI/Shutterstock“I just caught a bit of an understeer for some reason,” he said. “That was it. So I’m a bit frustrated because I certainly think I could have done a better job.”Piastri followed, was quicker in the two opening sectors, and grabbed the top spot. The serious business is yet to come but he could do no more than finishing on top both times when push came to shove and ensuring Norris will have no easy ride to his first F1 title.After the sprint race Norris also hit back at Verstappen’s comments, made earlier in the weekend, when the Dutchman stated he wouldalready have won the world championshipif he had been driving a McLaren.“He generally has a good clue about a lot of things, but there is also a lot of things he doesn’t have much of a clue about,” Norris said. “But it is also Red Bull’s way of going about things, an aggressive nature and just talking nonsense a lot of the time.“It depends if you want to listen to it and talk about it like he would love you to do, or do what we do as a team which is keeping our heads down and stay focused. Maybe he would have done [won the title easily] but he hasn’t done so far.”Lewis Hamilton’s trying weekend in a poorly performing Ferrari continued as he went out in Q1 in 18th place, having managed only 17th in the sprint race.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Oscar PiastriLando NorrisMax VerstappenMcLarenRed BullFormula OnenewsShareReuse this content"

They are back up to second, four points behind the Gunners, who travel to Chelsea on Sunday. This was Leeds’s fourth straight league reverse but the fight shown augurs well for Daniel Farke’s job security.City had spurned a two-goal interval advantage after Dominic Calvert-Lewin, a half-time substitute, terrorised the hosts. The 28-year-old scored in the 49th minute, then claimed the penalty that led to Lukas Nmecha’s 68th-minute equaliser, rattling Josko Gvardiol enough for him to scythe the striker down.Everton v Newcastle: Premier League – liveRead moreCity’s response was admirable. The substitute Rayan Cherki fed Foden who ran left across Leeds’s area before beating Lucas Perri. Yet Leeds’s second-half display again illuminated City’s defensive frailties – they are too easily raided along the flanks, in particular.Guardiola said: “We are not a team to win these types of games a lot. When we knew it was 10 minutes extra time we said: ‘Let’s go.’ We had two or three chances to score, we were able to close and it was massively important for our mood. Tomorrow we see Arsenal and Chelsea, but it’s important to be as close as possible to the top.”After 59 seconds, a diagram of City at their best was offered. Nico González swivelled and tapped the ball to Gvardiol, whose 45-yard diagonal hit Matheus Nunes. The right-back leaped to control, relayed the ball infield to Bernardo Silva, darted forward, received possession again and found Foden, whose finish pinballed off the bar.View image in fullscreenLukas Nmecha’s penalty was saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma but he could smile after equalising from the follow-up.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersAn apt riposte toTuesday’s 2-0 loss to Bayer Leverkusen, as Foden and Nunes were two of the 10 changes that backfired on Guardiola.City were rampant and a second goal soon lit up the scoreboard. When Foden’s corner from the right came back to him he rammed the ball at goal and a flying Perri palmed away for a corner on the other side. This came in from Tijjani Reijnders, Nico O’Reilly beat a flailing Perri to head down and Gvardiol finished. The video assistant referee’s check for offside proved negative and City cruised.The charge regarding Farke is that he is out of his depth at this level. His team were being cast the same, so a rare foray that featured Wilfried Gnonto passing to Nmecha had to be converted instead of being blasted over.At the interval, Farke hooked Gnonto and Daniel James for Calvert-Lewin and Jaka Bijol, switching to 3-5-2, and there was an instant dividend. Nunes, twice, was City’s culprit. First, a loose pass ceded possession. Then, when Calvert-Lewin got the better of a covering Gvardiol, Nunes could have hacked clear. But the auxiliary defender dawdled and Calvert-Lewin poked home.Gianluigi Donnarumma was jeered by the travelling support for requiring attention – perhaps as this allowed Guardiola to have a pitchside pow-wow. Farke, too, was dubious. “It’s in the rules, it’s smart,” he said. “If I like it, if it is fair play, I keep it to myself and leave it to the authorities to find solutions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Next press conference you can ask me and I will ask Gigio.”View image in fullscreenPhil Foden shows his delight after putting Manchester City ahead after one minute.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersThe chat did zero good, because after Jayden Bogle’s header into City’s area a hapless Gvardiol was spooked by Calvert-Lewin, who was upended. This was the clearest penalty Peter Bankes will give yet still Rúben Dias moaned to the referee in comical manner. Up stepped Nmecha, whose initial effort was saved by Donnarumma before the forward rolled the rebound in.Guardiola’s order to up the tempo resulted in goalmouth scrambles involving Bernardo Silva, O’Reilly and the anonymous Erling Haaland but Leeds escaped. Sadly for them, they could not avert City’s box-office finale but on this evidence Farke is still being heeded by his players. “My players should take pride,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Lavelle then went wide to Alyssa Thompson, who quickly returned the ball. Lavelle found Moultrie, who went far side for her second goal in as many appearances with the team.“We talked about starting fast and starting strong, and I think the momentum carried out,” Moultrie said. “We had a really good week of training, so I feel like it flowed into the first minutes of the game.”An offside call on Lavelle at the 48-minute mark denied Moultrie her second goal.In the 64th minute, Sam Coffey dribbled down the middle and found Macario breaking on her left. Macario took the pass and fired a shot far side to give the United States a two-goal lead.Macario added her second in the 76th minute when she snared a pass from the team’s youngest player, 18-year-old Lily Yohannes, and fired a shot from the top of the right side of the box to the far side of the goal.It was Macario’s 15th goal in 28 international appearances. Macario has now been involved in 18 goals in her last 14 US appearances.“It was a great win, it’s always a pleasure being with this team,” said Macario, who has 12 goals and six assists since February of 2022. “I feel so happy to be in this environment, and I feel like it really just helps you be the best version of yourself.“Lucky enough that [US coachEmma Hayes] knows me very well, and she knows what I can bring to the team. This was a good year ... in which I have just been trying to find some consistency ... just trying to find my rhythm.”Explore more on these topicsUSA women's football teamItaly women's football teamFriendliesUS sportsWomen's footballEmma HayesShareReuse this content"

Milwaukee’s loss eliminated them from contention.From value-adds to networking superconductor: how the weird language of tech dulled sport | Aaron TimmsRead more“I told the guys they did a heck of a job finding a way,” Knicks coach Mike Brown said.Toronto won East Group A and Orlando topped Group B, both with 4-0 records. The Knicks went 3-1 in Group C and finished first on the head-to-head tiebreaker over Miami, who also went 3-1 to take the East wildcard.Oklahoma City – the defendingNBAchampions, now 19-1 on the season – held off Phoenix to win West Group A and secure a quarter-final place, while San Antonio edged Denver in a frantic finish to clinch West Group C and another spot.“I don’t know much about it other than the guys are really excited about it,” Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said. “I know we’re in because we won. I know we beat some really good teams to do it … so we feel really good about it.”Phoenix went 3-1 in group play to earn the West wildcard. Their reward is a rematch with the Thunder in the quarter-finals.“They’re feisty as hell. They play hard,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said of the Suns.The quarter-finals will be played on 9 or 10 December. Orlando, the East’s top seed, secured home court after beating Detroit 112-109 on Friday – setting up a wildcard Heat visit.“We’re so happy to be home,” Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said. “We have some of the best fans in the NBA. They’re going to be back there, supporting us, ready to go. … For us to do this is very special for our guys right now.”The Heat v Magic, Knicks v Raptors and Thunder v Suns ties create a scheduling quirk: the games count as regular-season fixtures, meaning each of those matchups will occur five times this season – the first time that has happened in the Sunshine State rivalry since 1993-94.Miami visit Orlando for a regular-season game on 5 December – their second trip there this season – before returning days later for the Cup quarter-final.“It’s great,” Orlando’s Desmond Bane said on learning the Magic would host a Cup quarter-final. “We’re building. We’re building something special.”The Lakers, winners of the inaugural Cup in 2023, were the only Western Conference team assured of a quarter-final place entering Friday’s play.The 22 teams that missed the quarter-finals will have two regular-season games added to their schedules in the coming days to bring their total to 82. All teams began the season with only 80 fixtures to accommodate theNBA Cupformat.Those additional games – one home, one away – will be scheduled for 11, 12, 14 or 15 December.For teams that progress, the quarter-finals serve as game No 81. The four quarter-final losers will play each other within their conference to complete their schedules.The semi-finals take place in Las Vegas on 13 December, and those games also count in the regular-season standings. The championship game – which does not – is in Las Vegas on 16 December.Players on the quarter-final teams will each get $53,903. The payout increases to $106,187 for berths in the semifinals, $212,373 for a spot in the final – and $530,933 for each player on the winning team.Two-way players will receive half those amounts, if applicable.Explore more on these topicsNBA CupNew York KnicksMiami HeatOrlando MagicToronto RaptorsUS sportsNBAShareReuse this content"

Yet the club has also had £18m in help from other, unwitting backers: Welsh taxpayers.The club has received almost £18m in nonrepayable grants from the Welsh government via the local council, according to UK government state aid disclosures – far in excess of the direct aid listed for any other football club in Britain.Wrexham County borough council had previously said that the club would receive a“substantial amount”of a £25m Welsh government grant to redevelop the area around the Wrexham General train station next door to its stadium, the Racecourse Ground. However, the council has not previously revealed that the football club would directly receive most of that cash.Wrexham is owned by Reynolds and McElhenney, who has changed his name to Rob Mac, according to UK and US company filings. Reynolds, the producer and star of thebillion-dollarDeadpool film series, and McElhenney, the producer and star of comedy series It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, completed the takeover in 2021.The Welsh government money flowed even as its star owners produced thefour series of Welcome to WrexhamDisney TV documentary charting the “fairytale” takeover – reportedly pulling in as many as 5 million viewers an episode. While Wrexham AFC does not gain any revenue directly from the series, other companies owned by Reynolds and McElhenney are thought to have benefited from lucrative production deals.The stars also helped the club to win sponsorship deals from global brands including Facebook owner Meta, United Airlines and TikTok – names that would be coveted by Premier League teams.Stefan Borson, a football finance expert and the head of sport at the law firm McCarthy Denning, said: “This looks like an £18m nonrepayable subsidy to a privately owned business now flirting with a £350m valuation. Its existing owners are US-based and very wealthy and liquid private individuals.“The club, and its owners, will benefit from the stand for the next 50 years, yet at no point would the taxpayer be repaid or directly profit from the club’s rise.“The current ownership have put Wrexham on the global map but it is hard to understand why funding this stand in this way would be a priority for the government.”Separate to the grant, the Welsh government in 2020 also bought land adjoining the stadium in order to accommodate a new stand. The Welsh government hasrepeatedlytalked upthe boost to local transport from its £25m investment, without mentioning that most of the money was to be granted to the football club.View image in fullscreenThe council has said the funding would be used to redevelop the stadium to ‘enable international matches to be hosted in Wrexham once again’.Photograph: Jon Super/APThe grant comes at a time when council budgets are under pressure. The news site Wrexham.com this weekreported on an alleged “budget crisis”in some of the city’s schools, with some schools possibly forced to cut spending to make up for a£3m budget deficit. Mark Pritchard, who leads the group of independent and Conservative councillors who control the council, this weektold the Leader newspaperthat “redundancies will be inevitable” if the Welsh government does not increase the £263m council budget.The council said that funding for the project was not taken from its budgets, but was provided solely through Welsh government grants. The club must also make the Racecourse Ground (Cae Ras in Welsh) available for other sporting events and concerts, which the council said would create “additional benefits for the residents of north Wales”.A spokesperson said: “The Racecourse is an important cultural and heritage asset for the city of Wrexham and we are obviously keen to protect it for the future.“Utilising grant funding from Welsh government, the council have provided funding to the football club to enable the redevelopment plans to be enhanced to a standard to enable international matches to be hosted in Wrexham once again.”A Wrexham AFC spokesperson said the funds would be used for overall improvements of the stadium and a newKop standthat would bring the stadium to international level.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stockport County finished one place below Wrexham this summer and weredenied hugely lucrative promotion to the Championship; Stockportmade £9m in revenuesfor the year ended June 2024.The only other football league clubs named in the state aid disclosures were Plymouth Argyle, which received £2m, Swansea City, which received £400,000, and Bradford City, which received £670,000.The records show two direct grants from Wrexham County borough council to Wrexham AFC Limited. The first was a £3.8m payment awarded in February 2022, while the second was a £14m payment awarded in September, according to the records. Wrexham’s 2023 accounts refer to £4m in “deferred grants”.In the records, the council claimed: “The location and financial challenges of the site mean that the redevelopment of the stand and peripheral improvements, each to the standards required by Uefa, were deemed commercially unviable.” It added that there was “no incentive for the private sector to pursue the project as the value of the economic and social benefits it will bring are not taken into account in the primarily monetary driven investment decision-making process”.However, Wrexham AFC’s 2024 accounts suggested that was not the case. They said: “Increasing the capacity at the Racecourse Ground is a fundamental requirement of creating a long-term business plan for the club.”Welcome to Wrexham does not directly contribute to Wrexham AFC’s revenues. However, the global exposure has helped it to massively increase turnover from £10.5m in 2023 to £26.7m in the year to June 2024, according to its latest published accounts. The Financial Times reported that revenues in the last year could reach £50m – including 100,000 shirt sales for a city with about 66,000 in its urban area.The Welsh government said: “Public sector funding will make the crucial difference between the club satisfying league requirements and meeting the more demanding international fixture standards.“This investment helps create a venue that can host competitive international football at the world’s oldest international stadium, boosting the local economy and delivering a fitting landmark for Wrexham.”Explore more on these topicsWrexhamWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

A year later, the Bears bullied Philadelphia’s defensive line for a relatively easy win at the home of the Super Bowl champions.The Eagles (8-4) seemingly had the NFC East wrapped up two weeks ago, only to suffer consecutive defeats that have them looking little like a Super Bowl contender. Perhaps still feeling the sting of turning a 21-0 lead at Dallas on Sunday into a 24-21 loss, the Eagles’ offense showed few signs of snapping out of its funk. Fed-up Philly fans spent the game booing and calling for the team to fire offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo.The Eagles’ season has taken such a turn that even the beloved tush push doomed them in this one.With the Eagles trailing 10-9 late in the third quarter, Jalen Hurts fumbled on the tush push deep in Chicago territory and the Bears recovered.The Bears – who have a knack for winning one-score games – turned the turnover into the drive of the day. Monangai ripped off a 31-yard run on the first play and Caleb Williams – who was 17 of 36 for 154 yards and a touchdown – completed a seven-yard pass to Colston Loveland on fourth down that extended the drive.Monangai ran for a four-yard TD that made it 17-9 early in the fourth, and Williams added the insurance score with a 28-yard TD pass to Cole Kmet for a 24-9 lead.Fans who had been chanting “Fire Kevin!” began flocking toward the exits – and the Eagles will face even more questions about the sorry state of their offense.The Bears don’t care. Even with three linebackers out with injuries, Chicago socked the Eagles from the jump.Philly’s Jalen Hurts threw for 230 yards and a pair of touchdowns to disgruntled receiver AJ Brown, who had 10 catches for 132 yards. Saquon Barkley couldn’t break free against one of the worst run defenses in theNFLand finished with 56 yards rushing.The Eagles ran just 17 plays and had two first downs (with 83 total yards and 26 rushing) in the first half. The Bears totaled 142 rushing yards in the half.Swift, who became the first running back to top 100 yards rushing against the Eagles this season, scored against his former team on a three-yard run a 7-0 lead. The Bears lead 10-3 when Hurts hit Brown in the third quarter for a 33-yard TD that made it 10-9.Jake Elliott missed the extra point, adding to the list of ugly plays that sunk the Super Bowl champs.Hurts and Brown connected on late four-yard TD late in the fourth, but the Eagles missed the two-point conversion attempt to keep it a two-score game.Explore more on these topicsNFLChicago BearsPhiladelphia EaglesUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Heavy England wins have been few and far between in recent years. A7-0 defeat of a heavily depletedand underfunded Jamaica in their final warm-up game before the Euros was the biggest since a 10-0 defeat of Luxembourg in 2022.Against China at a moon-topped Wembley, the margin was eight, a Georgia Stanway hat-trick and Beth Mead double was added to by goals from Lauren Hemp, Ella Toone and Alessia Russo to complete the rout.England 8-0 China: women’s friendly football international – live reactionRead moreThere was some nostalgia in the comprehensiveness of this victory. When Sarina Wiegman’s tenure began in 2021 there was no Nations League and World Cup and Euros qualifying looked a little different. England went unbeaten under Wiegman all the way to theirfirst European Championship titlein 2022, sweeping teams aside by large margins.Those games were a mixture of friendlies and straightforward World Cup qualifiers against teams such as North Macedonia, Luxembourg and Latvia.Since then, the impression has been that England have failed to regain that all-conquering form of Wiegman’s early tenure, but that would be a naive and unfair assumption to make. The reality is that work has been done by Fifa and Uefa to improve the competitiveness of qualifiers and improve the challenge for teams up and down the rankings list.View image in fullscreenAlessia Russo scores England’s eighth goal at Wembley.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe 8-0 win on Saturday evening harked back to a simpler time, a time where physical, technical and tactical competitive tests were rare in between major tournaments and, while it was a lot of fun at a sold-out Wembley, it was not something we should long for month-in month-out.The crowd was a little patchy in the upper tier for a sold-out event at the national stadium, but there is always a drop off for England women games, 74,611 the actual attendance. The fact that the FA was able to sell out the stadium for a friendly visit of the team ranked 16th in the world was, in reality, hugely impressive when previous sell-outs had come against top-10 teams.They were treated to a show. Despite the many absences through injury or to manage return from injury or workloads – Leah Williamson, Hannah Hampton, Lauren James, Khiara Keating, Alex Greenwood, Michelle Agyemang and Jess Carter all out – there was a familiarity to the starting XI.Anna Moorhouse was handed a first start in place of injured Keating and Hampton, and Maya Le Tissier partnered Esme Morgan with centre-back options reduced, but the rest of the starting lineup was surprisingly strong.View image in fullscreenGeorgia Stanway (left) and captain Keira Walsh embrace after England’s fourth goal.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I think that went really well,” Wiegman said of her centre-back duo. “[They] played together in the last camp too. They can show where they are at as individuals and also how they connect together. I think it worked well.”That England were five goals up by the break was no surprise as a result. The work rate of Mead and Hemp on the wings was critical to stretching China’s back line and Lucy Bronze’s flick on for the former opened the goal rush 12 minutes in. The Arsenal forward brought the ball down with one touch before she fired past Pan Hongyan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stanway joined the party a lengthy seven minutes later, when Hemp’s effort was punched away by Pan but turned in by the Bayern Munich midfielder on the half-volley. Her second came before the break, the ball came back off Li Mengwen’s high hand and the referee Alina Pesu pointed to the spot which Stanway duly converted from. Stanway secured her hat-trick after a neat one-two with Ella Toone after half-time.Then Toone turned in, firing in Pan’s errant pass after the keeper came under pressure from Russo, and Russo finally got on the scoresheet herself to add England’s eighth.“What I wanted was to come here, show who we are and put a good performance in,” said Wiegman. “I hope everyone enjoyed that. We did. We wanted to be better in the final third and today we did that and that made China look worse too because we scored easier.”There was little to glean from this fixture in terms of where England are in their development, their strength in depth and ability to untangle the low block the highlights of an entertaining and inconsequential evening.Explore more on these topicsFriendliesEngland women's football teamChina PR women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Howe’s team were superb as they routed Everton, scoring more goals in one devastating evening than in their previous seven away games combined. He may well question why it has taken so long for such commanding form to materialise.Newcastle had taken the lead in their three previous away fixtures and lost them all. There would be no lapses on this occasion. A ruthless display, aided and abetted by some dreadfulEvertondefending, ensured a first Premier League away win since the trip to Leicester on 7 April was in effect secured by half-time.“It’s a big moment for us confidence-wise and the good feeling of back-to-back wins in the Premier League will help us no end,” said Howe, who joined his players in applauding the travelling Newcastle support long after the final whistle. “It was really important because we haven’t had that feeling at all. I had a real sense of disappointment and regretafter Marseille, which wasa difficult experience for the supporters, and it was important to give them that winning feeling to take back to Newcastle.”Everton 1-4 Newcastle: Premier League – as it happenedRead moreNick Woltemade’s tidy feet and the pace of Anthony Elanga hurt the Everton defence throughout. The pair combined 20 seconds in when Woltemade sent the winger clear of Vitalii Mykolenko and Jordan Pickford tipped Elanga’s low drive around a post. From the resulting corner, delivered superbly by Lewis Miley, the Newcastle centre-half Malick Thiaw rose between James Tarkowski and Michael Keane to open the scoring with a close-range header. At 55 seconds, the Germany international’s goal was the fastest scored in the Premier League this season, beating Phil Foden’s 59-second effort forManchester City against Leedsearlier in the day.Everton responded well to the early hit and dominated until presenting Newcastle with their second. Jack Grealish and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall stretched the visitors but, aside from a Keane strike that was deflected over, David Moyes’s side struggled to create a clearcut chance. Aaron Ramsdale enjoyed a gentle return to the Newcastle lineup. The decision over whether to drop Nick Pope after his mistake in Marseille was taken for Howe with the keeper injuring his groin in training on Friday. His replacement was well protected by Dan Burn, Thiaw and the rest of the Newcastle defence.The same could not be said of Pickford, though it was his glaring error that allowed the visitors to double their lead. Elanga again caused chaos when beating Mykolenko. Burn diverted a Tino Livramento shot that was heading wide back to Miley, and his drive sailed through Pickford’s guard. Quite what England’s No 1 was thinking as he tried to pat the ball down, succeeding only in knocking it through his legs, is anyone’s guess. The away fans relished that slip by the Sunderland fan they love to bait.View image in fullscreenNick Woltemade scores Newcastle’s third goal with a lob.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersThere was no stirring reaction from the hosts this time. Without Idrissa Gueye, who was serving the first of a costly three-match banfor slapping Keane at Manchester United, Everton’s midfield was carved open too easily. Gueye’s replacement, Tim Iroegbunam, toiled for the 45 minutes he was on the pitch.The midfielder erred before Pickford for Newcastle’s second goal when miscontrolling before Livramento shot. He was also at fault for Newcastle’s third when failing to cut out Livramento’s pass to Elanga. With Everton’s central defenders chasing back, the winger turned the ball inside to the unmarked Woltemade, who lifted a cool, measured finish over Pickford.

But Newcastle remained dangerous and added a fourth after Pickford made two good saves in quick succession to deny Harvey Barnes and Woltemade. Lewis Hall swept a delightful cross to the far post, where Thiaw powered in his second header of the game.Thierno Barry thought he had finally broken his Everton duck when slicing in from close range. He celebrated as though he had netted a winner. But his wait for a first Everton goal goes on after the video assistant referee spotted Barry had handled prior to converting. Dewsbury-Hall did manage a consolation with an excellent finish from Tarkowski’s pass.“They were much better than us,” admitted Moyes. “We actually played pretty well with the ball. But the bigger thing was how quick they broke. Every time we gave the ball away they got on to our back line too quickly and it caused us problems. We couldn’t stop it.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueEvertonNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Portentous music plays. There is a sense of possibility, as though the inner workings of the universe have suddenly been laid bare, a door opening to reveal the three Fates sitting by their spinning wheel, measuring rod and shears in hand.A World Cup draw is a moment of perfection, a platonic vision before reality has had time to intervene. Everybody is fit and in form. Every nation is playing as an ideal version of itself – no injuries, no disputes over bonuses, no concerns about fatigue or the temperature or whether a player might be distracted by a possible transfer; it’s the World Cup as pure potential. WithFriday’s draw, next summer will suddenly feel a lot closer.World Cup 2026 draw to adopt tennis-style system for the four top seedsRead moreThere will be fixtures and opponents, a schedule and planning. But the draw also says a lot about the hosts: it’s an early indicator of what sort of tournament can be expected. Last time the United States hosted, in 1994, they went all out for glitz, glamour and Americana. The draw was staged in Las Vegas, very much a home of determining the future through guided randomness.Pelé, despite being the only footballer many Americans could name, was notably absent, having accused the thenFifapresident, João Havelange, of corruption. Faye Dunaway, Robin Williams, Beau Bridges, the gymnast Mary Lou Retton and Evander Holyfield were there, though, conducting the draw along with Franz Beckenbauer, Eusébio and Bobby Charlton, as though to try to batter sceptical Americans into taking an interest through star power alone.And to an extent it worked, even if Germany’s 1-0 win over Bolivia in the opening game was overshadowed byOJ Simpson’s car chasethrough Los Angeles the same day.View image in fullscreenSepp Blatter (centre), at the time Fifa’s secretary general, stands below the board showing the group breakdowns after the 1994 World Cup final draw in Las Vegas in December 1993.Photograph: John Gurzinski/AFP/Getty ImagesJules Rimet, the Fifa president largely responsible for the invention of theWorld Cup, understood the iconography of a draw. Sickened by the fascist excesses of Mussolini’s Italy in 1934, he had shown remarkable diplomatic skill to ensure France rather than Nazi Germany hosted in 1938, avoiding the grim possibility of the World Cup becoming a propaganda spectacle like the 1936 Olympics.To emphasise the wholesome tone, in the ornate Salon de l’Horloge at the Quai d’Orsay in Paris, Rimet had his six-year-old grandson Yves, hair awkwardly scraped into a side-parting, wearing collar and tie, shorts and knee-length socks, gleefully pulling balls out of a glass vase as though they were toffees from a jar.For years after that, the draw featured Fifa committee men awkwardly sitting behind a desk with something akin to a railway departure board behind them. The days of David Beckham, Gary Lineker and Jermaine Jenas, Charlize Theron, Fernanda Lima and Samantha Johnson were a long way in the future.View image in fullscreenJules Rimet holds the urn for his grandson Yves in Paris as he makes the draw for the 1938 finals.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThene plus ultraof all draws camefor the 1982 World Cup: nothing else has quite captured the same blend of United Nations aesthetic withJeuxsansfrontièresspirit. There was Havelange, sinister and handsome, like a Bond villain pretending the chaos is part of the plan while secretly plotting a terrible revenge. There was Sepp Blatter, in those days the secretary general, before his hair had gone, so it looked like somebody had dropped a toupée on the trophy.There was a baffled Archie Macpherson, the Scottish football commentator, desperately trying to work out what was going on when Fifa messed up the draw procedure before reminding his audience that – perhaps uniquely – he had been right in the first place. There was a crew of confused and sulky Spanish orphans in absurd traditional dress, one of whom ended up being berated by a seething Blatter.The giant steel cage tombola used for the Spanish national lottery malfunctioned, with balls becoming jammed in the release tube. One ball fell apart completely. Best of all was the Fifa vice-president Hermann Neuberger, president of the West German football association, who became increasingly uncomfortable before, as Blatter glared at him, breaking into hysterical laughter when West Germany were grouped with Austria.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will be staged not in Las Vegas as had been widely expected but at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, which is itself of political significance given how Donald Trump has taken it over. It will go on for ever, and be conducted by an array of celebrities aligned with the president’s Make America Great Again movement and the usual Fifa cast of assimilated and unthreatening former players. It will feature 16 more teams than ever before, with a greater degree of interference to keep the top-ranked sides apart.It’s been standard since the first World Cup in 1930 to draw one seed in each group (a special prize to anybody who knew that the four seeds in Montevideo were Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil and the USA) and the practice of structuring the draw to try to ensure a geographical spread is familiar, but this is the first time an attempt has been made to seed within the seeds so that, if they win their groups, Argentina, Spain, France and England cannot meet until the semi-finals.Rimet would have disdained such gerrymandering. At the draw for the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics, when Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the husband of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, pulled out his country to face the champions, Uruguay, and (probably) jokingly asked if he could have another go, he was met with frosty silence; integrity was not something to be trifled with.The break with tradition is yet another example of the game’s leaders prioritising marketing over sporting concerns but football retains a pleasing capacity to upset the best-laid plans. In 1982, Italy’s and Argentina’s struggles plus Spain’s unexpected 1-0 defeat to Northern Ireland messed up the seeding, leading to one second-phase group of Brazil, Italy and Argentina and another of Spain, West Germany and England.Football’s self-defence mechanisms are going to be severely tested over the coming months. This is going to be another World Cup in which the glory of the sport itself stands in contrast to the ugliness that surrounds it. Friday will be the first real indication of just how much that may encroach on the actual football.For now, though, let’s just imagine the glorious prospect of a group featuring ideal versions of Spain, Ecuador, Norway and Ghana.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026Inside footballFifaFootball politicsWorld CupcommentShareReuse this content"

You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel it, the anxiety.”Amorim cited Dorgu missing a chance to equalise in Monday’s1-0 loss to Evertonas an example. “I remember the shot against Everton [dragging it wide],” he said. “That was easier than the decision that he had to make [against] Scotland – and I saw [his quality] when he played in Italy. But again, here [United] is different and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning, but he has time to improve.“I just need to understand the context in trying to help them [Dorgu and Dalot]. They are far from their best, and they know it. Like a lot of players in our team, like myself. I just look at them, and think they have so much more to give. So let’s see this week if we can improve that.”Amorim, preparing for Sunday’s game at Crystal Palace, was asked why his side have conceded 19 goals in 12 Premier League games. Referring to his back three, he said: “One of them is Luke Shaw [a left-back], sometimes we have Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw, so we play with one centre-back. If you play Amad [Diallo] on the wing-back, [he] is not a wing-back, he’s a winger.”Amorim said his team needed to defend better. “We are being really soft near the box. So we need to improve that in the last games, especially against Nottingham [Forest, a 2-2 draw]. We allowed a lot of crosses, we didn’t press well [in] moments. Against Everton, they were with 10 men [after 13 minutes] and we suffered the goal [Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s winner] with the only shot on target.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Raphinha was instrumental again in the 26th minute with another assist, this time for Olmo who expertly curled the ball home first-time from inside the box as theBlaugranawent ahead. Olmo put the result beyond doubt in added time, finishing off a smooth one-two with Lamine Yamal, whose through ball left him free inside the box to slot home with composure.Atlético Madrid’sAlexander Sørloth struck twice to give the home side a comfortable 2-0 victory over strugglingReal Oviedo, extending Diego Simeone’s winning streak to seven matches in all competitions. The Norwegian needed just 26 minutes to wrap up the points against the bottom side, who have managed only two competitive wins all season. The victory extended Atlético’s unbeaten league run to 13 matches and lifted them to third on 31 points, one point behind Real Madrid.View image in fullscreenBayern Munich’s Luis Díaz sets the Bundesliga leaders on their way to a 3-1 win over St Pauli with a goal in stoppage time.Photograph: Angelika Warmuth/ReutersThe Bundesliga leaders,Bayern Munich, needed stoppage-time goals from Luis Díaz and Nicolas Jackson to beat strugglingSt Pauli3-1, coming from behind for the second straight week and hitting the woodwork three times. Bayern’s comeback win means they set a Bundesliga league record of 44 consecutive rounds at the top of the table.Díaz headed in for a 2-1 lead early in stoppage time and Jackson slotted in their third goal as the hosts bounced back from their first defeat of the season across all competitions, Wednesday’s 3-1 loss at Arsenal in the Champions League.Bayern found themselves 1-0 down in the sixth minute whenSt Pauli, who have now lost their last nine league games, pressed high and won possession, Andréas Hountondji finishing the move with a powerful shot. With more than 80% of possession in the first half, Bayern desperately tried to come back as they had done last week when they recovered from two goals down to crush Freiburg 6-2.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.They hit a post with Lennart Karl’s curled shot in the 23rd and again through Tom Bischof’s deflected effort 12 minutes later. Raphaël Guerreiro, however, made no mistake when he drilled in from a Díaz assist a minute before half-time to level.Bayern were again in control after the break but St Pauli stayed compact and disciplined. Harry Kane hit a post with a volley late in the game before Díaz put them in front early in stoppage time and Jackson added his goal at the very end to lift them to 34 points.Borussia Dortmundscored once in each half and survived a lateBayer Leverkusencomeback to win 2-1 on Saturday and leapfrog the hosts into third place in the Bundesliga. The Argentina youth international Aaron Anselmino headed home a Daniel Svensson free-kick after 41 minutes to put Dortmund in front before Karim Adeyemi headed in Fabio Silva’s cross in the 65th.Leverkusen pulled a goal back through the substitute Christian Kofane in the 83rd after Jonas Hofmann had rattled the crossbar with a powerful shot. Dortmund had conceded late equalisers in their last two league matches but despite late Leverkusen pressure they held on this time to earn the three points.“It was not easy. After the goal we conceded they put pressure on us,” said the Dortmund coach, Niko Kovac. “Today it was a good team performance.”Milansecured a hard-fought 1-0 home win overLaziothanks to Rafael Leão’s goal early in the second half to take over at the top ofSerie A. The victory put Milan on 28 points, one above second-placed Roma before their Sunday game at home to Napoli; the defending champions are third on 25 points. Lazio are eighth with 18 points.The Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan produced a moment of brilliance inside two minutes when he somehow clawed away Mario Gila’s point-blank header with a fingertip save. Despite the intense start, the first half produced few other clear chances. Maignan repeatedly snuffed out Lazio’s early attacks with solid saves, while Milan created only a handful of half-chances with the teams going into the break goalless.The hosts, however, came out with renewed vigour after the break. A well-worked move released Fikayo Tomori on the right, allowing him to drive in a low cross that Leão met with a sliding finish six minutes into the second half.In the final seconds, tension rose when Lazio appealed for a penalty after a last-ditch attempt, believing Strahinja Pavlovic handled to clear a cross. Milan’s manager, Max Allegri, was sent off for protesting against the referee reviewing the incident on the pitchside monitor; Lazio’s assistant manager, Marco Ianni, was dismissed for dissent seconds later. In the end, the referee Giuseppe Collu ruled out a penalty, judging that Pavlovic had been fouled first.Juventusclaimed a 2-1 win overCagliariafter a Kenan Yildiz double turned the match on its head. The victory brought some relief for Juve after two league draws, putting them in seventh place on 23 points.Sebastiano Esposito gave Cagliari the lead after 26 minutes, tucking the ball home from close range after a low ball from the byline found him unmarked. But Yildiz refused to let the visitors enjoy their advantage for long. Barely a minute later, he levelled the match by bending a low shot from the edge of the box into the far corner.View image in fullscreenKenan Yildiz celebrates scoring his and Juve’s second goal against Cagliari in first-half stoppage time.Photograph: Claudio Benedetto/IPA Sport/ipa-agency.net/ShutterstockJuve had seized the momentum. In first-half stoppage time, Weston McKennie’s clever back-heel went to Pierre Kalulu, who found Yildiz at the edge of the area. With two deft touches, the Turkish forward slipped between two defenders and guided a precise finish into the far corner.Takumi Minamino’s solitary strike earnedMonacoa 1-0 home win against theLigue 1leaders,Paris Saint-Germain, who slipped to their first league defeat since September and second of the season.TheMonacomidfielder Lamine Camara was fortunate to escape with a yellow card early on for a dangerous lunge on Lucas Chevalier, violently catching the goalkeeper’s right ankle after he kicked the ball. Chevalier recovered and made a good one-handed save from Minamino’s volley later in the first half.The Portugal midfielder Vitinha, who scored a brilliant hat trick in the Champions League in midweek, was kept quiet by Monaco’s hard-working midfield. PSG were exposed to counterattacks and Minamino made no mistake in the 69th, expertly controlling Aleksandr Golovin’s pass from the left and clipping the ball past Chevalier.The Monaco defender Thilo Kehrer was sent off in the 80th following a video review after shoving a PSG player in the back. Paul Pogba came off the bench in the closing stages for Monaco.PSG’s coach, Luis Enrique, said: “It’s hard to maintain consistency when you make individual errors. It was our worst match of the season. They deserved it more than we did. It was a bad night for us, a very bad night.”PSG are seven points ahead of sixth-place Monaco and one aboveMarseille, who were denied top spot by Santiago Hidalgo’s stoppage-time equaliser forToulousein a 2-2 draw, whileParis FCwere held 1-1 at home by the bottom club,Auxerre.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballLa LigaBarcelonaAlavesBayern MunichBorussia DortmundJuventusnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet Sunderland’s adopted motto – “Til The End” – has become so much more than just another piece of cod psychology.After sustaining them through last season’s successful playoff campaign it has morphed into a true mantra, encapsulating everything that is so refreshing about this impressively resilient team.Manchester City 3-2 Leeds, Sunderland 3-2 Bournemouth, and more – Premier League liveRead moreThanks partly to Granit Xhaka’s superb on-field leadership, Sunderland have developed a useful habit of recovering from losing positions. Here, though, they surpassed themselves, conjuring a memorable victory after swiftly falling 2-0 behind to a similarly determined, talented and rapid counterattackingBournemouth.Long before the end Regis Le Bris’s decision to deploy Enzo Le Fée in a fluid central midfield role had paid rich dividends with the Frenchman’s vision and passing incision repeatedly damaging the visitors. “I was very pleased with Enzo,” said Le Bris, whose team rose to fourth.“Resilience is crucial in this league and we had the right connections in the team to recover. Many teams would have given up, but it shows my players have strong character. They are never beaten and want to fight.”In January 2020, Antoine Semenyo arrived at Sunderland, then in League One, on loan from Bristol City, but the young winger barely had time to get going before the Covid pandemic struck and he returned to Bristol. PSemenyo, now Bournemouth’s best player, hit the ground running in the incessant, and torrential rain.Seven minutes were on the clock when Semenyo’s sublime low cross prefaced Evanilson’s shot hitting a post, leaving Amine Adli to lash the rebound beyond Robin Roefs.Eight minutes later, Bournemouth doubled their advantage courtesy of an exquisiteTyler Adams lob from just inside the centre circle. A goal of the season contender? Most definitely.Yet 2-0 can be a tricky lead for teams to protect and, sure enough, Bournemouth’s cushion suffered a 30th-minute deflation. When Reinildo, schooled in plenty of streetwise arts during his time playing under Diego Simeone at Atlético Madrid, flicked out a leg in the penalty area, the left-back invited Alex Scott to foul him.Scott duly walked into the trap and Tim Robinson, the referee pointed immediately to the penalty spot. Andoni Iraola, Bournemouth’s “very disappointed” manager, claimed Robinson had “lost control of the match”, but that penalty decision from a referee whose officiating, at times, annoyed both sides survived a video assistant referee review.Le Fée stepped forward and, lifting his kick into the top left hand corner, afforded Djordje Petrovic no hope of making a save.Darker arts were at play as Reinildo, well aware Scott had already been booked, attempted to earn the midfielder a second yellow card by running across his path and precipitating an inevitable collision. Robinson, though, was not buying it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They took the lead when Brian Brobbey, who had just replaced Wilson Isidor, connected with a fabulous Le Fée corner with an emphatic, header.Although Marcus Tavernier’s 25-yard shot rattled the woodwork Bournemouth failed to recover as Xhaka took every available opportunity to slow the game down. With Bournemouth’s frustration evident Lewis Cook was shown a stoppage-time red card for elbowing Noah Sadiki in the face.If the game’s 11 yellow cards – five apiece for each team and one for Iraola – were, at least partly, testament to its intensity, an indisciplined Bournemouth were left with one point from their past fourPremier Leaguegames.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueSunderlandBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Tottenham have not won at home in the league since beating Burnley on the opening weekend.Frank said: “When you’re down 2-0 after six minutes, there is a mountain to climb. When you’re in a bad spell, everything seems to go against you as well – the first was a deflected shot, the second is a mistake from Vic.“I didn’t like that our fans booed at him straight after and a few times after that. They can’t be true Tottenham fans because everyone supports each other when you’re on the pitch and we do everything we can to perform. I’m fine with them booing after the match, no problem, but not during. That is unacceptable in my opinion.”On a rancorous Saturday evening atTottenham HotspurStadium, Frank’s players left the field to loud booing at both half-time and full time. Vicario accepted full blame, saying: “It’s tough because to go 2-0 down after six minutes, you never expect this. Especially the second goal was a mistake of mine. I take the responsibility for that. The intent was to clear the ball long but I hit the ball in a bad way.”View image in fullscreenGuglielmo Vicario looks dejected after Fulham’s second goal against Spurs.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersOn the fans’ reaction, he said: “It’s part of football. So I am a big man. I am quite older. What can I say? We cannot be influenced by situations in the stand. Fans have the right to do what they think. It’s on us to try to stay more calm and focus on ourselves.”With a promising start to his tenure long since faded, Frank continued: “This result leaves us in a place where we have lost another game. Every game has a single story, this game we lost in the first six minutes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Saints lost Edoardo Todaro to a first-minute red card and it was downhill all the way after that as Bristol ran in six tries.Scrum-half Kieran Marmion scored two and Tom Jordan, Kalaveti Ravouvou, Aidan Boshoff and Luka Ivanishvili also crossed, with Sam Worsley kicking five conversions and two penalties. JJ van der Mescht and Tom Litchfield scored Northampton’s tries, one of which Fin Smith converted.Etzebeth red mars South Africa romp as Wales slump to record home defeatRead more“I’m really proud of the boys as we fought for everything, with the first half being brilliant,” said theBristolhead coach, Pat Lam. “As a result we got the outcome we wanted, five points against the top-of-the-table side and them leaving with nothing.”Welsh wing Louis Rees-Zammit came on as an early replacement for the injured Jack Bates. He said: “I’m really enjoying it back in the Premiership and, after some disappointing results last season, we wanted to make Ashton Gate a fortress again. After today it’s three from three here. We wanted to use the air more today and we won the aerial battle with our forwards being magnificent.”Saints director of rugby, Phil Dowson, was at a loss to explain his side’s performance. “It was ugly again at Ashton Gate and we’ll need to lick our wounds after that,” he said. “We seemed very flat and tepid and you’ll get found out against a side like Bristol, who come hard at you.”Saints made a disastrous start by losing Todaro, newly capped by Italy, to an immediate red card. Todaro’s dangerous challenge on Worsley while he was in the air left the referee with little alternative and Bristol soon capitalised when Marmion quickly took a tap penalty to dart over.Bristol soon scored another when Jordan ran a clever angle to collect a pass from James Williams for an easy run-in before they produced the try of the game by bemusing the opposition with some splendid inter-passing. It culminated in Harry Thacker bursting down the right touchline and, when the hooker was brought down, Marmion was on hand to pick up and score his second.View image in fullscreenAidan Boshoff screams with delight after scoring a try for Bristol.Photograph: Paul Rubery/Focus Images Ltd./ShutterstockBears suffered a blow when Bates left the field with an injury to be replaced by Rees-Zammit but it did not slow the hosts’ momentum as a thumping tackle by Benhard Janse van Rensburg on Smith enabled Ravouvou to seize possession before running 45 metres to score.Northampton’s miserable first half was complete when they conceded a fifth try from replacement Boshoff, who collected a well-timed pass from Worsley to leave Bristol with a 35-0 interval lead.Six minutes after the restart, Saints at last struck a blow when giant lock Van der Mescht forced his way over to reward their first period of pressure, but Worsley soon extended the home side’s lead with a straightforward penalty.Saints, a more competitive side in the second half, scored a second from Litchfield after the centre won the race to collect a well-judged kick from George Furbank. Worsley added a second penalty for a match tally of 16 points before Ivanishvili finished off a driving lineout to emphasise Bristol’s superiority.George Skivington hailed the centre Seb Atkinson’s impact on his return from injury inGloucester’s26-15 victory overHarlequins.Atkinson, who excelled on England’s summer tour to Argentina, was ruled out of the Autumn Nations Series after suffering a knee and hip injury during the Prem defeat at Bath in mid-October. But he looked as though he had never been away asGloucesterclaimed their first Prem win of the season at the sixth attempt.View image in fullscreenBen Redshaw scored twice in Gloucester’s victory.Photograph: Warren Little/Getty Images“Having Seb back and his energy back was great. He is a guy you want to build things around,” Gloucester’s head coach Skivington said. “He is a tough lad and he deals with things pretty well. He controls what he can control. Seb is a massive part of it here. He is a leader and him being on the field is crucial for us.”The full-back Ben Redshaw also shone, scoring two tries as Gloucester triumphed for the first time in league action since May. The flanker Lewis Ludlow and wing Ollie Thorley added further touchdowns for Skivington’s team, securing a bonus-point success complemented by the fly-half Ross Byrne kicking three conversions.Quins had scored the first try through Cadan Murley and led 12-7 after Alex Dombrandt’s score, converted by Marcus Smith. A Smith penalty was Quins’ only score after half-time.On Friday,Exetercame from 26-6 down to secure a dramatic 27-26 win and inflict a rare home defeat onSale. Tries from Jack Yeandle, Olly Woodburn and Scott Sio, all converted by Henry Slade, gave the Chiefs victory.Leicesterextended Newcastle’s losing start to the Prem season with a 39-17 victory in a clinical five-try performance.

Over the course of a friendly walk through the company offices, Karp fields no questions about Palantir’scontroversial ties to ICEbut instead extolls the company’s virtues, brandishes a sword and discusses how he exhumed the remains of his childhood dog Rosita to rebury them near his current home.“That’s really sweet,” host Molly O’Shea tells Karp.If you are looking to hear from some of tech’s most powerful people, you will increasingly find them on a constellation of shows and podcasts like Sourcery that provide a safe space for an industry that is wary, if not openly hostile, towards critical media outlets. Some of the new media outlets are created by the companies themselves. Others just occupy a specific niche that has found a friendly ear among the tech billionaire class like a remora on a fast-moving shark. The heads of tech’s largest companies, including Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Satya Nadella and more, have all sat for long, cozy interviews in recent months, while firms likePalantirand Andreessen Horowitz have branched out this year into creating their own media ventures.At a time when the majority ofAmericans distrustbig techandbelieve artificial intelligence will harm society, Silicon Valley has built its own network of alternative media where CEOs, founders and investors are the unchallenged and beloved stars. What was once the province of a few fawning podcasters has grown into a fully fledged ecosystem of publications and shows supported by some of the tech industry’s most powerful.While pro-tech influencers like podcast host Lex Fridman have for years formed a symbiotic relationship with tech elites like Elon Musk, some firms have decided this year to cut out the middleman entirely. In September, the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz announced that it had launched an a16z blog on Substack. One of its prominent writers, investor Katherine Boyle, hasa longstanding friendshipwith JD Vance. Its podcast has meanwhile grown to more than 220,000 subscribers on YouTube, and last month hosted OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, whocounts Andreessen Horowitzas a major investor.“What if the future of media isn’t controlled by algorithms or legacy institutions, but by independent voices building directly with their audiences?” the firm wrote in its Substack announcement. The firm once invested $50m in the digital media upstart BuzzFeed with a similar vision, only to see it fall into penny stock territory.The a16z Substack also announced this month that the firm was launching an eight-week new media fellowship for “operators, creators, and storytellers shaping the future of media”. The fellowship includes collaborating with a16z’s new media operation, which it describes as being made up of “online legends” creating a “single place where founders acquire the legitimacy, taste, brandbuilding, expertise, and momentum they need to win the narrative battle online”.In addition to a16z’s media effort, Palantir launched a digital and print publication earlier this year called the Republic that mimics academic journals and thinktank-style magazines like Foreign Affairs. The journal is funded by the Palantir Foundation for Defense Policy and International Affairs, a non-profit of which Karp is the chair, though he only works there 0.01 hours per week, according to 2023 tax filings.“Far too many people who should not have a platform do. And there are far too many people who should have a platform but do not,” states the Republic, which has an editorial team made up of senior Palantir executives.A sampling of the articles the Republic has published includes an essay arguing that US copyright law restrictions will prevent US AI dominance and another from two Palantir employees on how Silicon Valley working with the military is good for society, a point Karp has himself mademany times.The Republic joins a burgeoning set of pro-tech publications like Arena magazine, which was founded late last year by the Austin-based venture capitalist Max Meyer. The outlet takes its motto, “The New Needs Friends”, from Disney’s film Ratatouille.“At Arena, we don’t cover ‘the news.’ We cover The New,” a letter from the editors stated in its inaugural issue. “Our mission at Arena is to cheer on the people who are, slowly but surely – and sometimes very quickly! – bringing the future into the present.”The letter echoes a sentiment shared by its founder, who has criticized publications like Wired and TechCrunch for being too critical in their coverage of the industry.“The magazines that have historically covered this area are just super negative now. By being bold and positive, we’re going to battle with them,” Meyer told Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of Palantir, on the latter’s podcast.Some parts of tech’s new media scene have also grown more organically, rather than being created as an official corporate media arm – even if the optimistic overall tone is similar. The TBPN video podcast, which reimagines tech industry minutiae like hirings as a high-stakes drama akin to an NFL draft, has rapidly grown in influence since launching late last year. The show’s self-aware yet pro-tech vibe has attracted prominent fans and guests, including Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, who gave an in-person interview in September to promote Meta’s smart glasses.Another podcaster, 24-year-old Dwarkesh Patel, has similarly built out a miniature media empire in recent years through long, collegial interviews with tech leaders and researchers about artificial intelligence. Earlier this month Patel talked with Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, who gave him a tour of one of the company’s newest datacenters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since the billionaire bought Twitter in 2022, the company has throttled links to critical news outlets and set up autoreplies that return poop emojis when reporters reach out for comment. He has seldom given interviews to established media outlets, but appears for long sit-downs with sympathetic hosts like Lex Fridman and Joe Rogan, in which his opinions go largely unchallenged.Musk’s embrace of creating a media bubble around himself has also shown how detached this kind of content can become from reality and result in the pursuit of alternative facts. The billionaire’s longstanding discontent with Wikipedia led him this year to create the AI knockoff Grokipedia, whichgenerates blatant falsehoodsand results that fit his own far-right worldview. Musk’s chatbot Grok has meanwhile repeatedly expressed opinions that mirror the billionaire’s own opinions orgo to ludicrous lengths to flatter him, including last week claiming that he was fitter than LeBron James and could beat Mike Tyson in a boxing match.The rise of tech’s new media is also part of a larger shift in how public figures are presenting themselves and the level of access they are willing to give journalists. The tech industry has a long history of being sensitive around media and closely guarded about their operations, a tendency that has intensified following scandals likethe Facebook filesthat have exposed internal documents and potential harms. In one example of how skittish some in tech have become around negative press, journalist Karen Haowrites in her 2025 book, Empire of AI, that OpenAI did not officially speak to her for three years following a critical profile she did on the company in 2019.Tech’s move towards sympathetic outlets and in-house media creation also mirrors a strategy the entertainment industry took on years ago. Film and album release press tours have long been tightly controlled affairs, where actors and musicians go through a gauntlet of easily vetted, low-stakes interviews on shows like Hot Ones. Politicians have embraced a similar model – as was evident during Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign tour of podcasters like Theo Von, or California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, launching his own politics podcast earlier this year – which offers them both access to new audiences and a safer space for self-promotion.Even if much of this new media isn’t aiming to expose wrongdoing or challenge people in power, it is not exactly without value. The content that the tech industry is creating is frequently a reflection of how its elites see themselves and the world they want to build – one with less government regulation and fewer probing questions on how their companies are run. Even the most banal questions can also be a glimpse into the heads of people who exist primarily in guarded board rooms and gated compounds.“If you were a cupcake, what cupcake would be?” O’Shea asked Karp on Sourcery presented by Brex.“I don’t want to be a cupcake because I don’t want to be eaten,” Karp said. “I’m resisting becoming a cupcake.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But, lest one forget, it is also a story about breaking the lawSat 29 Nov 2025 15.58 ESTLast modified on Sat 29 Nov 2025 18.12 ESTShareIt was 70 years ago when four African Americans were sitting in the fifth row of a bus in Montgomery. As one white man had to stand towards the front, the driver asked the four to get up and move towards the back of the bus. Three did; one did not – the rest is history. Or so many American kids might think when they first read the story of Rosa Parks in school.It is a story of courage, but, lest one forget, it is also a story about breaking the law. And the question for us today is what civil disobedience means in an era when the federal government is signaling its readiness severely to punish even perfectly legal dissent.Before getting into any arguments about how disobedience can end up strengthening democracy, it is worth reminding ourselves that the textbook version of Parks is usually not the whole story. She was not just a fatigued seamstress who, after a long day, at work, spontaneously decided to protest against injustice. Rather, Parks had been a member of the NAACP in Montgomery since 1943; she had led the organization’s youth, and she had beeninvestigating rapes of African Americanwomen in Alabama.Brand-new activists are discovering political movements – and each other: ‘You feel the camaraderie’Read moreWhat Obama once claimed – “that any of us ordinary people without rank or wealth or title or fame can somehow point out the imperfections of this nation, and come together, and challenge the status quo, and decide that it is in our power to remake this country that we love until it more closely aligns with our highest deals” – is true, but it is not the whole truth: Parks had no rank or wealth, but she had plenty of fellow activists and friends.Resistance is a matter of coordination, and coordination is helped by having an effective organization behind you. The bus boycott – which lasted a staggering 381 days – depended on organizers quickly distributing pamphlets in the Black community and on volunteers running “private taxis” (the US supreme court ruled segregation of buses unconstitutional in December 1956). Parks went on record saying: “The only tired I was, was tired of giving in.” Others were tired of it, too, but had the energy and courage to organize.What the political theorist Brandon Terry has called “our culture’s compulsive references to the civil rights movement” and, more particularly, “the apparent concord of civil rights celebration” overlook that non-violent protest against injustice was hardly popular among whites across the country. It is something Trump’s court historians, starting with the ill-fated1776 Commission, tend to leave out of their narratives; they make it seem like the entire nation loved coming together around the idea of “color-blindness” in the 1960s – and it was the only the crazy leftist proponents of identity politics who undermined that happy consensus.Civil disobedience is a “public, nonviolent, conscientious yet political act”, according to what remains its most influential definition, put forward by the towering figure in political philosophy of the second half of the 20th century, John Rawls. There are reasons to think that Rawls’s approach has become objectively more difficult to implement today. Rawls had claimed that breaking the law to point to an injustice could convince majorities to bring about change. But he was relying on a media system that allowed majorities to see injustice – think of the vicious attacks by policemen (and their dogs) on civil rights protesters in Birmingham. While information is more accessibly today – and Black Lives Matter crucially depended on acts of police brutality going viral – our media landscape is alsomuch more fragmented, with plenty of rightwingers making sure that events arereframed, which is a polite way of seeing: making sure their meaning is distorted.Rawls also relied on the notion that, in an “almost just” society, disobedience should involve being willing to accept punishment – as a demonstration of one’s overall “fidelity” to the law (which would also make it harder to have one’s conduct be portrayed as anarchism or worse). Of course, there is a general question as to whether one considers the US “nearly just”; but, more particularly, there is the evident tendency by the Trump administration to undermine the rule of law.The attorney general has seemingly given up on any independence from the executive, racing to follow Trump’s commands to exert retribution on his supposed enemies. As members of the Department of Justicehave reported, the idea is no longer that cases are brought after fact-finding; rather, cases are constructed and then the race is on to find facts that might fit. There is valiant pushback by some judges; but the structural damage and corruption have been enormous already.Rawls thought of civil disobedience as a form of “public speech”. It is unclear whether that speech will be heard. Even if it is, one might doubt whether it will get a good-faith hearing by the authorities. The philosopher had assumed that “in a state of near justice, vindictive repression of legitimate dissent is unlikely”. Today, dissent both legitimate and legal is already being targeted by Trumpists and the president himself (threatening most recently to go after citizens who, to his mind, are disturbing “domestic tranquility”). Anyone contemplating civil disobedience must have answers to challenges which, for all the injustices of the south, “the mother of the civil rights movement” did not have to face in quite the same way.Explore more on these topicsProtest (US)OpinionCivil rights movementDonald TrumpTrump administrationLaw (US)US politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Now it’s just another day in America. During a holiday when many Americans were gathering with family and reflecting on what they were grateful for, Trump was crouched over his keyboard slinging insults at his perceived enemies.On Thanksgiving day, for example, Trump posted a rant onTruth Socialabout immigration. He called Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, an ableist slur, and then made an Islamophobic jab at “the worst ‘Congressman/woman’ in our Country, Ilhan Omar, always wrapped in her swaddling hijab”.It was a busy Thanksgiving for Trump, who also insulted a female journalist who was asking him about the suspect in Wednesday’s attack on two national guard members in Washington DC. “Are you stupid? Are you a stupid person?” the presidentdemanded.You don’t have to be a particularly perceptive person to know that Trump loathes most journalists – particularly women. The misogynist-in-chief has awell-documented historyof lashing out at women who dare challenge him. Still, even by his own low standards, the past few weeks have been remarkable. The president seems to be on a rage-filled downward spiral, and is taking much of his aggression out on female members of the media.On Wednesday, for example, a day before his “are you stupid?” comments, Trumpfumedonline about the New York Times, which had just published areporton how the 79-year-old is increasingly showing his age. The piece, written by Katie Rogers and Dylan Freedman, noted that the president “keeps a shorter public schedule than he used to” and has been caught dozing off. Trump did not namecheck the male co-author in his Truth Social post, zeroing in on Rogers instead. “The writer of the story, Katie Rogers, who is assigned to write only bad things about me, is a third rate reporter who is ugly, both inside and out,” the president wrote.Earlier this month, Trump also calledMary Bruceof ABC News “a terrible person” after she had the temerity to ask his pal Mohammed bin Salman, the visiting Saudi crown prince, about the killing of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Prince Mohammed, who is sometimes known asMr Bone Saw, has denied involvement in Khashoggi’s killing but a 2021 US intelligence report found the crown princeapproved the brutal murder.In the same week he attacked Bruce, Trump jabbed his finger at Catherine Lucey, Bloomberg’s White House correspondent, and said: “Quiet, piggy.” Lucey had asked Trump about the Epstein files, which is something of a sore topic.Meanwhile Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, seems keen to follow Trump’s lead when it comes to insulting female journalists. On Wednesday, the New Yorker writer Jane Meyer wrote on X that the attack on the national guardsmen was “so tragic, so unnecessary” as the national guard “should never have been deployed” to DC. Cheungwrote back: “Jane, respectfully, shut the fuck up for trying to politicize this tragedy.”It can’t be stressed enough that this isn’t just the president and his staff being a bit rude to a handful of female journalists. When the president insults these women, he opens them up to harassment from his acolytes. And, of course, he sends a message to the world about what he thinks about press freedom and what he thinks about women.According to Mary Trump, the president’s niece and a vocal critic of his politics, the president may inadvertently be sending another message with his recent behaviour. This week, Mary Trumpnoted on her YouTube showthat her uncle’s “misogynistic attacks against reporters … are increasing” and believes that this points to two things. First, that “he’s increasingly comfortable lodging such attacks”, and second, “that he’s a little rattled” because the pressure is getting to him. In response, Cheungtold the Daily Beastthat Mary Trump is a “stone-cold loser”.I don’t know if “rattled” is quite the word for what is happening in Trump’s brain. Rather it would seem that Trump, who has frequently referred to himself as a “king”, would like to turn himself into another Mohammed bin Salman and the US intoanother Saudi Arabia. In the prince’s Saudi Arabia, journalistslive under heavy surveillance, media outlets stick to the government narrative and a handful of critical tweets canget you locked up.The US might not be quite at that point yet, but it’s on the way. Mary Trump is right that the president is “increasingly comfortable” attacking female journalists. And, after all, why wouldn’t he be? He seems to suffer few consequences for these gendered attacks. Trump may wear his misogyny on his sleeve but there are plenty of women (and, of course, men) who are happy to overlook it. While it’s impossible to come up with exact numbers, polls and analysis show that amajority of white womensupported Trump in 2024 – even after he was legally defined as a sexual predatorby a New York jury. And Trump actually increasedhis support among female voters in 2024versus 2020 and 2016. Trump can apparently call female reporters “piggy” all he likes; there are still plenty of Maga sheep willing to support him.More than 240 women allege drugging by senior French civil servantThe women were given beverages during a supposed job interview with a senior civil servant. Unbeknown to the women, the drinks were mixed with a powerful and illegal diuretic that would make them need to urinate. The police found a spreadsheet titled “Experiments” on the civil servant’s computer,where he allegedly notedthe times of druggings and the women’s reactions.Italy now recognizes the crime of femicideThe new lawpunishes femicidewith life in prison.Every day, 137 women and girls are killed by intimate partners or family membersThat’s according to the2025 femicide reportfrom the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and UN Women, which notes there has beenlittle progresson the issue.The Free Birth Society is linked to baby deaths around the worldInfluencers have made huge amounts of money pushing the idea of “natural” births online and sowing distrust in the medical establishment. The result,a Guardian investigation shows, is scores of avoidable deaths.Israeli police raid Palestinian children’s play on Ben-Gvir’s ordersThe policestormed a performanceof Dreams Under the Olive Tree at El-Hakawati theater in East Jerusalem on Sunday night and forcedcrying childrento leave. The far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, gave the order to close the show, saying it didn’t have the required permit. The “you don’t have the right permit” excuse has long been invoked by Israel to bulldoze Palestinian houses and control Palestinian life. As theNorwegian Refugee Councilexplains: “Demolitions are rooted in a planning system that denies Palestinians the right to build in Area C, which covers more than 60 per cent of the West Bank and remains under full Israeli control. Palestinians must apply for permits that are almost never granted. Since October 2023, 282 applications have been submitted. Not a single one was approved.”Experts warn of ‘global crisis’ as number of women in prison nears1 millionThe number of incarcerated women is rising much faster than men, with poverty, abuse and discriminatory lawsdriving this trend.The week in poultryiarchyElon Musk is not the only power broker who seems to yearn to be astandup comedian. JD Vance addressed service members at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, ahead of Thanksgiving and attempted a poultry bit of humour. “Think about turkey,” Vance said. “Be honest with yourselves. Who really likes turkey?” When a few soldiers raised their hands he said: “You’re all full of shit.” He then riffed on this for a while before concluding: “Chicken is good all the time.” Trump is well practiced at throwing red meat to his base in speeches, but the dreadfully dry Vance always sounds as if he’s just winging it.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe Week in PatriarchyWomenGenderFemicideChildrenIsraelPalestinecommentShareReuse this content"

Nor is it a victoryStephen WertheimThe conflict is neither a clearcut defeat nor a feelgood victory, but an in-between outcome that contains profound elements of eachSat 29 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 29 Nov 2025 13.26 ESTShareNo one should be satisfied with the unjust peace thatUkrainemay be forced to accept. The aggressor would be rewarded with territory and other concessions from the victim it has brutalized. Yet the horrified reaction in Washington to recent peace proposals is troubling in its own right.The Trump administration’s recent28-point plan, roundly denounced in Congress and the commentariat as a “capitulation” to Moscow, actually offered Kyiv a remarkable strategic outcome. Under its terms, Ukraine would face no meaningful limit on its peacetime military, despite Russian attempts to impose draconian restrictions since 2022. (The only requirement, a cap of 600,000 personnel, probably exceeds the number of active-duty forces Ukraine would maintain anyway.) Moreover, Ukraine would receive asubstantial security guaranteefrom the United States and Europe – the strongest in history, even if short of a Nato-style commitment.Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, launched his invasion to break Ukraine’s alignment with the west and against Moscow. When the fighting stops,Ukrainewill be militarily stronger, more hostile to Russia and better protected than ever before.Yet it is already clear that this outcome, if and when it may be realized, will be deemed unacceptable and immoral by powerful voices in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. Continuing the war indefinitely is highly likely to leave Ukraine worse off – smaller, weaker and even more devastated – but that won’t keep senators such asMitch McConnellorJeanne Shaheenfrom railing against a least-bad compromise. It is easy to call for ideal outcomes when one is thousands of miles away and pays no price for sounding morally superior.Ukraine risks becoming the latest victim of the US’s chronic inability to see the outcomes of its wars for what they are. In prior conflicts, the US has repeatedly refused to “take the win” or accept that it could not attain everything it sought. Instead, the country has become consumed with its failure to achieve absolute victory or perfect justice, and taken destructive actions as a result. It should not make the same mistake now.In prior wars, the US has struggled both to accept loss and to accept victory – two distinct manifestations of the pursuit of ideal solutions, each relevant to Ukraine’s war today.The United States has several times allowed faltering military campaigns to drag on unnecessarily for years, not because presidents believed they could pull out a win but because they wanted to avoid taking the loss. In Vietnam, Richard Nixon chased “peace with honor” by continuing to fight for four years after taking office, before finally signing peace accords in 1973. He secretly bombed Cambodia and Laos, devastating both countries, merely to delay America’s inevitable defeat. Nixon purchased a “decent interval” between America’s withdrawal and North Vietnam’s victory with enormous quantities of blood.Similarly, one decade into the war in Afghanistan, Barack Obama recognized that the Taliban would not be militarily defeated. Yet he made minimal attempts to negotiate a power-sharing arrangement that might have ended the war and preserved, in part, the US-backed government in Kabul. The United States drew down but fought on and steadily lost ground for another decade. Unable to win yet unwilling to compromise, the United States left itself no choice but to withdraw unconditionally. When it did so, the Taliban swept back to power across the country. Armchair warriors in Washington bemoaned the absence of a “decent interval” despite the indecency of their complaint: more war would only have cost more American and Afghan lives.Failing to accept losses, the United States has also, and no less damagingly, failed to accept its own wins. In 1991, under George HW Bush, the United States decisively achieved its primary aim of ejecting Iraq’s forces from Kuwait. Having proved able to reverse Iraqi aggression, the United States could have pulled back from the Persian Gulf, knowing it could return if Saddam Hussein attempted another invasion. Instead, Washington dreamed bigger. Bush called on Iraqis to “take matters into their own hands” and force Saddam from power. He thus defied America simply by surviving, and Americans concluded that their mission remained unaccomplished. The United States proceeded to “contain” Iraq through routine bombings and the first-ever open-ended deployment of tens of thousands of soldiers in the region. After 9/11, the next Bush administration decided to finish the country’s unfinished business in Baghdad, to disastrous effect. The United States squandered its original achievement in the quest for total triumph.These precedents matter in equal measure for the war in Ukraine today. The conflict is neither a clearcut defeat nor a feelgood victory, but an in-between outcome that contains profound elements of each. Ukraine has achieved astonishing successes that must be retained. It has also suffered immense losses that will not be redeemed. Ending the war requires coming to terms with both sides of that mixed verdict.On the one hand, like the US-backed governments in Saigon and Kabul, the government in Kyiv will not achieve a total battlefield victory, and it is fantastical to believe that Ukraine could do so. Even the Biden administration, despite sometimes framing the stakes of the conflict in absolutist terms, never really expected Ukraine to liberate all its territory by force. The best that can be achieved is a compromise settlement that gives Ukraine a viable chance at peace and security while allowingRussiato reap strategic and territorial gains. If this feels like a dirty deal, like some measure of appeasement, that’s because it is. But if there is no better alternative, it will be a dirty deal worth making.On the other hand, the United States and Ukraine are struggling to internalize the enormous achievement they have already attained. Nearly four years after Russia expected to overrun its opponent in four days, Ukraine still stands. The vast majority of its people and its land remain intact. Russia, meanwhile, has suffered mightily for its botched invasion, enduring upwards of 600,000 casualties – roughly 10 times the number of Soviet casualties suffered over a decade in Afghanistan – for what look to be modest gains. Ukraine has proved, as few believed before 2022, that it can impose severe costs on its enemy. If it can rebuild and retain a strong military with western help, it stands a fair chance of deterring another war once this one ends.That is a win worth taking. It may not, it is true, satisfy those in Washington or Kyiv who seek to escape all insecurity through Nato membership or a similar pledge from Ukraine’s allies to take up arms automatically in its cause. But total security is not available for Ukraine, or any country. Even if Nato admitted Ukraine, as it will not do, the alliance would provide no genuine guarantee of safety. Whatever they may pledge on paper, countries that have declined to fight for Ukraine to date are unlikely to go to war for it in the future. The last four years have shown both the lengths and the limits to which Ukraine’s partners will go.Fortunately, Ukraine does not require a geopolitical deus ex machina to survive. It needs itself, and the external support it can realistically receive. Still less does the United States, an ocean away, need a miracle to occur in Ukraine. Misplaced moralism is no reason to risk all that has been accomplished to date.Stephen Wertheim is a senior fellow in the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a visiting lecturer at Yale Law SchoolExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionRussiaTrump administrationUS foreign policyEuropeUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Since then, teachers have reported classrooms a third empty, as parents are too scared to send their kids in – volunteers walk them there and back.In the Rogers Park area of Chicago, a group of citizens are organising to resist such immigration raids. Sometimes, it’s simple non-violent tactics, such as slowing officers down by walking in front of them.Last month, 50 people rushed to a church, where the congregation was trapped, having got word that there were ICE agents waiting outside. Maybe their most evocative tactic is whistles – coded blasts for when a convoy is suspected to be ICE agents, a different code when it’s confirmed. They have numerous accounts of undocumented migrants warned off driving right into a raid, which is galvanising, but they also see and hear dismaying things all the time: vehicles standing empty, one door open, not robbed, merely relieved of their drivers; landscape gardeners arrested off ladders. Earlier this month, the Protect Rogers Park group got 1,500 calls in a day.This isn’t unusual;people don’t like it when their neighbours are disappeared. Similar stories could be told about Kenmore Street, Glasgow, or Peckham, in London, where neighbours surrounded Home Office vans until they were forced to release their cargo and head home.But I only know aboutRogers Park from Criminal, a true-crime podcast. It’s been running for more than a decade, and covers crimes that range from the macabre to the peculiar – always introduced with the same disconcerting intonation, the host announcing “I’m Phoebe Judge” with the kind of pride and pizzazz you might use for “I’m Mr Invisible”. But who, in this episode, is the criminal?It’s plain from the start that she is not talking about the whistleblowers, and yet it still takes a while for your brain to catch up: she has got to mean the federal government. This is a huge thing to imply, only secondarily because Trump is notoriously litigious, particularly against media organisations. First and foremost, it’s a terrifying thing to articulate: if your government is breaking the law, what do laws mean? Can any be relied upon once some are breached? How do you tell the difference between living in such a society and hiding in it? In this, and a number of other episodes, Criminal is forensic, sober, but also quite unusual: a norm has settled over the reporting of ICE, where all the facts are laid out – raw numbers, painful details, the state of detention centres – except the central one, that people are being kidnapped.Hannah Arendt discussed the termGleichschaltung, roughly translatable as “coordination” or “synchronisation”. It came from the Nazi justice minister Franz Gürtner to mean, broadly, that all political, social, cultural and civic institutions had to fall in line with the totalitarian state. Such a thing can only be achieved with the complicity of everyone: the minute-by-minute decisions of people who will do anything, personally or professionally, to stay with the majority. It might mean turning a blind eye to unacceptable state actions, or it might mean insisting, with the logic of your arguments, that things are still the same when they plainly are not.View image in fullscreenPeople queue to pick up donated food at the Care for Real Rogers Park location, Chicago, 13 November 2025.Photograph: Erin Hooley/APThis is the trap many Democrats are currently in – they producepie chartsto show that the majority of immigrants snatched off the streets are not criminals, but they do not say that todetain 65,000 peopleis an authoritarian act. And this is partly a boiling-frog effect: ICE has been in existence since 2003, introduced by George W Bush after 9/11; Barack Obama was no stranger to deportations; that uptick of detainees may break records, and the sheer activity of ICE across the US is running communities ragged, but there were nearly 40,000 migrants in detention when Donald Trump took office in January. Nobody gets a memo when democracy tips into something else.But it’s not all avoidance: most people prefer to synchronise, to stick with the majority. The anthropologist Michael Maccoby, writing in The Leaders We Need almost 20 years ago, drew on the research of Erich Fromm from 1930s Germany, and summarised quite bluntly that, as Fromm predicted, only about 15% of people resisted nazism. It wasn’t because they were fervent supporters, or even, at the outset, because they were scared, but because that’s where the herd was.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The New York Times reported on a bizarre set of documents in which Marco Rubiotells diplomats in Europeto “regularly engage host governments … to raise US concerns about violent crimes associated with people of a migration background”. Bizarre as that is, it’s not why the story of Rogers Park, and the storytelling of Protect Rogers Park, is universally relevant.Don’t wait until your government is so racist that it’s lifting people off ladders while they are trying to work, or seizing kids as they are trying to get to school, before you protest. Every time you hear aggressive xenophobia and racist insinuation from those in power and check in with how it polled before you say it’s disgusting, you are building the herd that will suffocate opposition when it matters.In an event this autumn, Olly Knowles from Led By Donkeys said “The time to fight fascism isn’t five to midnight”, going on to say that he didn’t think we were at five to midnight in the UK. Someone in the audience said “What time is it?”, and it was funny because, really, who can say? It’s quite impressionistic, this metaphor, it’s not what you would call digital. But it’s the question to ask with each fresh wave of anti-migrant policy, and rhetoric, and kite-flying, and debate: what time does that make it? Because five to midnight is too late.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OpinionDonald TrumpUS immigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Claydon readthe listof the 74 Australian women who were murdered in the last year.“Every year I read this list in the hope it will be the last,” she said. “Heartbreakingly, that day has not yet come.”The rage remains.

It shouldn’t be up to whistleblowers to demand better | Regina FeatherstoneRead moreAs I’ve written before, gender-based violence, a sanitised term for the bashing, coercion, intimidation and murder of women, barely rated a mention in this year’s federal election campaign.In 2024 the prime minister, under pressure after a series of horrific deaths over the previous year,had named it a “national crisis”– which it is.But what’s changed?I have seen few words and even less action from the government on this since the election, and I don’t see any substantive policy or budget promises from the female-ledCoalitioneither.Women’s legal services still can’t meet demand.Crisis housing services still can’t meet demand.Did you know that in Melbourne hundreds of women and children are placed in cheap motels every night by services that have nowhere else to send them? And there they remain, especially vulnerable to the same violent offenders.Every two minutes police are called to a domestic or family violence matter. Yet policing responses often fail, asGuardian Australia’s two-year-long Broken trust investigationhas starkly reported.Red flags are too often missed. Data is inadequate and not synced up across states and justice systems.The real fix requires billions but even the$96.5m spent failing to fix the Bureau of Meteorology website, for example, would be welcomed by overstretched services.What better time to get a reality check than the16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence.Enter the “toxic trio”so described by the journalist and advocate Jess Hill – sport, alcohol and gambling.It’s an inconvenient truth but, for the sake of our mothers, our sisters and our daughters, it’s time to better connect the dots.We knowthat violence against women spikes around big sporting events.We know that alcohol use spikes and with it domestic and family violence.We know that Australians are the biggest per-capita gambling losers in the world.We know that the fastest-growing group of problem gamblers in Australia is young men aged 18 to 24.And we know that the government is resisting banning ubiquitous gambling ads due to pressure from big gambling, big sport and big broadcasting.Statistically, there’s a reliable way to predict a domestic violence homicide like Hannah Clarke’sRead moreStudies show that family violence isthree times more likelyto happen in families where there is problem gambling.Research from Australia’s National Research Organisation for Women’s Safety shows that loss of income from gambling canintensify the frequency and severityof men’s intimate-partner violence against women.What is happening behind closed doors in your street, your suburb, while the game is on, the grog is flowing and the bets are failing?It’s not a big leap.The independent MP Helen Haines made the connection in the parliament with a question to the prime minister on Wednesday.Albanese acknowledged the link. “There is no question, as well, that the cause of violence can never be excused but, in many cases, that is one of the issues – along with alcohol abuse, along with so many issues that cause violence,” he said.The federal government’sown reviewinto approaches to end gender-based violence recommended a phased ban on gambling advertising.The review also recommended other measures, such as restricting alcohol sales and advertising, and examining the density of poker machines in relation to the prevalence of family and domestic violence.So far, crickets.The evidence is there; the action is not.It’s heartening to see some in Labor speaking up on gambling advertising. The backbencher Dr Mike Freelander is right, in my view, when he says that a free or conscience vote across the chamber would yield a gambling ad ban.I know of members left, right and centre who would vote for it if unencumbered and able to vote based on the views of their communities.There are many arguments for it – protecting our children, reducing billions of dollars in public health costs, alleviating mental health issues and family breakdown, among others.This week, during the 16 days when we supposedly face into so-called gender-based violence, let’s also consider safety.It’s life and death.

It really isn’t that much of a mysteryNaoise DolanSurvey data suggests more and more girls can’t imagine getting married, while their male counterparts are keener. That disparity holds a clueSat 29 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 29 Nov 2025 09.27 ESTShareAccording to recent data, marriages in England and Wales aredown by nearly 9%after a post-pandemic spike, while civil partnerships have risen by almost the same percentage. This downward trend is also reflectedin the US. The Vatican has piped up in defence of the institution, releasinga 40-page doctrinal note, Una Caro (One Flesh): In Praise of Monogamy: Doctrinal Note on the Value of Marriage as an Exclusive Union and Mutual Belonging. Sworn celibates would not be my personal first port of call when seeking relationship advice, but to each their own – exclusively and indissolubly, if the Catholic church is to be believed.Among the younger crowd, gendered expectations about marriage are changing, at least according toa surveyby the University of Michigan, which found that only 61% of high-school girls want to be married one day, compared to 74% of the boys. Perhaps this is behind the burgeoning genre of opinion pieces in which a rightwing man complainsthat women don’t want to date him. Often enough, he is an avowed libertarian, leaving it a mystery why he does not simply accept the workings of the free market.But what could be putting young girls, and women, off marriage? Well, for women who date men, perhaps it’s the fact thatthis is what some men’sexpectations look like: “At least 20 years younger”, “good breeder”, “taller than 5ft 6in and can’t be a Scorpio”, says 79-year-old baronet Benjamin Slade, who is (in the manner of these things) in want of a wife. I will admit to having been momentarily impressed that this would-be husband knows about astrology, all the more so by his swift conversion of it into a new and exciting way to hate women. But with my rising Scorpio, 5ft 3in stature and hips better adapted to bearing a vintage bumbag than a child, I am presumably out of the running to wed him – as are you, dear reader, since the desired candidate cannot “read the Guardian newspaper”.One potential reason for the decline of marriage occurs quite early in the pipeline: fewer people are entering the committed relationships that tend to be a prerequisite, barring impulsive antics in Vegas. According toYouGov data, half of 18- to 34-year-old Americans have been in a “situationship”, defined in theCambridge Dictionaryas “a romantic relationship between two people who do not yet consider themselves a couple but who have more than a friendship”. A central feature of such arrangements is that only one party tends to consider it a “yet”.There are also more fundamental objections to the institution itself. For me, marriage is a form of state authority and coercion that I will not endorse through my participation. Governments use tax breaks, hospital visitation rights and other financial and legal incentives to enforce their chosen relationship structures above others: non-monogamy, communal living and other non-traditional arrangements are sidelined. I do not wish to judge anyone else for marrying, whether they do it wholeheartedly or simply pragmatically – that’s none of my business. But in terms of giving pen-pushing bureaucrats the power to legislate my own private life, it’s a no from me.My view is not universal. “People Still Want to Marry. Why Aren’t They?” asked aNew York Timespodcast last month. One explanation offered is that marriage is nowconsidered a “capstone”, not a start, to adulthood: there is increased social pressure to have your finances, career and long-term living arrangements firmly settled before tying the knot, in an atmosphere where employment is becoming ever more precarious and accommodation ever less affordable. For some, marriage is also still a life event that necessarily precedes having children; but many young women will have seen where caring responsibilities fell during the Covid pandemic, and must surely be concluding that the burdens that would be placed on them as parents are impossible.The optimistic spin is that rather than being cut off from marriage, we’re not being forced into it any more. Nobody who truly believes in the institution should want sceptics like me entering it, anyway. Perhaps the world ahead of us is one where the only people getting married are those who fully want to. That sounds like a happily ever after to me.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They paid tribute to the “brilliance and humanity” of his work and “his wit, his irreverence, his generosity of spirit and his profound love of the English language”.The Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger was among those remembering a “giant” of theatre who was “highly intellectual and very funny in all his plays and scripts”. “He loved classical and popular music alike which often featured in his huge body of work,” Jagger said. “He was an amusing and a quietly sardonic friend and companion. I will always miss him.”Nicholas Hytner, who directed Stoppard’s play The Hard Problem at the NationalTheatrein London 10 years ago, said: “Tom’s towering achievements came with an astonishing generosity and curiosity about the work of others. His shelves were stacked with the work of other playwrights. He seemed to see everything, and was precise and thrilling when he wrote in appreciation of the things he liked.“He was a great writer and a legendary host but those of us lucky enough to know him and work with him will remember him as an exceptional enhancer of the lives he touched.”The Society of London Theatre announced thatWest Endtheatres will dim their lights for two minutes on Tuesday in remembrance. Its president, Kash Bennett, said Stoppard’s “extraordinary voice reshaped modern theatre, combining intellectual daring, emotional depth and razor-sharp wit in work that challenged, moved and delighted audiences across generations”.Ina post on X, director Rupert Goold wrote: “Tom Stoppard’s magic was present in everything he wrote but he was also the kindest, most supportive, most generous, man.”Author Kathy Lette called him “one of the wittiest people I ever met” and saidon Xthat “a conversation with him left you reeling from irreverent and imaginative quip-lash”.One of a select band of writers from any discipline to earn his own adjective – “Stoppardian” – in the Oxford English Dictionary, he delighted in the most improbable juxtapositions: philosophy and gymnastics inJumpers(1972); early 19th-century landscape gardening and chaos theory in Arcadia (1993); rock music, dissident Czech academics and the love poetry of Sappho inRock ’n’ Roll(2006).A new Stoppard play has been an international event ever since Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, featuring two obscure Shakespearean courtiers, was spotted on the Edinburgh fringe in 1966 and developed by the National Theatre.With his restless imagination, Tom Stoppard showed us a mind on the moveRead moreHe combined more than 30 plays for the theatre with a steady stream of works for television and radio, and with screenplays including an adaptation of John le Carré’s The Russia House, Terry Gilliam’sBraziland a joint credit for the Oscar-winning screenplay ofShakespeare in Love.But his influence went far further than his on-screen credits would suggest: he was the go-to writer for blockbusters in need of a bit of spit and polish (includingIndiana Jones and the Last Crusadeand the Star Wars adventure Revenge of the Sith). Steven Spielberg once dragged him out of the shower with an urgent phone call to discuss a problem withSchindler’s List.Stoppard was thrice married and famously sociable. The playwright Simon Gray captured something of his charmed life when he quipped: “It is actually one of Tom’s achievements that one envies him nothing, except possibly his looks, his talents, his money and his luck. To be so enviable without being envied is pretty enviable, when you think about it.”His early childhood was not auspicious. Born Tomáš Straussler in Czechoslovakia, he was not yet two years old when his Jewish parents fled the Nazi invasion of 1939 for Singapore. Three years later, he was evacuated to India with his mother and brother, leaving his father behind to a fatal confrontation with the Japanese occupation as an army medical officer. After his father’s death, his mother married a British army major, Kenneth Stoppard, who adopted the boys and moved the family back to England after the war.Where to start with Tom Stoppard: from Brazil to LeopoldstadtRead moreStoppard left school at 17, initially to become a journalist on the Western Daily Press in Bristol. After a couple of years of playing around with short radio plays, his first stage play was picked up for the theatre in Hamburg and television in the UK. Moving to London, he wrote theatre reviews under the Evelyn Waugh-inspired pseudonym William Boot, before a Ford Foundation grant enabled him to escape to Berlin to devote himself to the idea that would become Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.Though the intellectual pyrotechnics and bravura theatricality of his early work led some to dismiss him as more head than heart, that began to change with The Real Thing, a meditation on the pain of infidelity and the unstable relationship between art and life, which Michael Billington ranked among the101 greatest playsever written. Premiered in the West End in 1982, it starred Felicity Kendal and Roger Rees in roles that were reprised on Broadway by Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close.During the 15 years after The Real Thing, he hit the top of his game. According to hisbiographerHermione Lee, Stoppard himself felt thatArcadia(1993) was probably his best play, whileThe Invention of Love(1997) – about the poet AE Housman – was his favourite. Only Hapgood (1988) fell foul of the old charge that it was too clever by half, with its combination of spy story and particle theory, though it was widely felt to be vindicated by a 2015 revival at Hampstead theatre.For all his personal sociability, as a writer Stoppard was a loner who did not share the left-leaning political sympathies of his playwriting contemporaries. Describing himself as a “timid libertarian” and “an honorary Englishman”, he was an admirer of Margaret Thatcher and, in 1984, signed a letter of support for the US invasion of Grenada. He was awarded a CBE in 1978 and was knighted in 1997. In 2013, he was awarded thePEN Pinter prizefor his “determination to tell things as they are”.He returned often to his central European origins, with works anatomising the cold war, including Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (1977), commissioned by André Previn for performance with a full onstage orchestra, and his great television play Professional Foul, which was screened in the same year. The latter was dedicated to his friend Václav Havel, who at the time was in and out of jail.He was in his 50s before he discovered the truth about his Jewish origins, and into his 80s by the time the knowledge metabolised into his late-period masterpieceLeopoldstadt, which followed a once-prosperous Viennese family from 1899 to 1955.Explore more on these topicsTom StoppardTheatreCzech RepublicRadioComedyEuropeBroadwaynewsShareReuse this content"

Beckett and Pinter did it in their way. The achievement ofTom Stoppardwas to take seemingly esoteric subjects – from chaos theory to moral philosophy and the mystery of consciousness – and turn them into witty, inventive and often moving dramas. Theatre, Laurence Olivier once said, is a great glamoriser of thought. Stoppard confirmed that with his capacity to make ideas dance.I was lucky enough to discover Stoppard early on. That was entirely thanks to Philip French who, aside from being a film critic, was also aBBCproducer. In 1966 he asked me to give a short talk on two radio plays by a then little-known writer (“a punk journalist from Bristol” was how someone described him to me) called Tom Stoppard. In The Dissolution of Dominic Boot, an impoverished writer ran up an ever escalating escalating taxi fare. And in If You’re Glad, I’ll Be Frank, a bus driver tried to contact his wife who was the speaking clock. I was struck by the ingenuity of both plays and got to meet their young author.It says much for Stoppard’s grace of spirit that even after I had gone on television in 1968 and given a sniffy, first-night review of The Real Inspector Hound – which I now love – he remained impeccably courteous. But one thing people forget about Stoppard is that, as an ex-journalist himself, he understood the ways of our world.View image in fullscreenTom Stoppard in 1974, the year he presented Travesties.Photograph: Radio Times/Getty ImagesFrom the start, Stoppard was celebrated as an intellectual gymnast: a man who was driven by ideas as much as by character and plot. But, just as we belatedly came to realise that Pinter was always a political dramatist, so we eventually came to see that there was an emotional undertow to Stoppard’s cerebral concepts. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead was praised for its cleverness in creating a drama out of two peripheral characters from Hamlet, but repeated viewings suggest that it is about how we are all victims of arbitrary circumstances leading to our extinction. I rememberJohn Wood, who had played Guildenstern on Broadway and who became an iconic Stoppard actor, telling me: “In Tom’s plays, the word is all. The word is beating back the silence, beating back the darkness … I think this is what makes his plays so moving and even tragic.”Tom Stoppard, playwright of dazzling wit and playful erudition, dies aged 88Read moreThe characteristic combination of intellectual audacity and emotional substance was also present in Stoppard’s 1972 hit, Jumpers. This, after all, was a play that raised a big philosophical question: whether social morality was a conditioned response to history or whether moral sanctions obeyed an absolute, God-given law. Not your average theatrical topic, but here the subject of a lecture being prepared by the play’s hero, George Moore. But the more one saw the play, the more one realised that it was also about the pain of a fractured marriage and the dangers of a disintegrating society in which astronauts were scrapping on the moon and a former minister of agriculture had been made archbishop of Canterbury.Stoppard’s achievement – one he shared with Michael Frayn – was to show that audiences were open to plays about complex ideas. His work was also meticulously researched. I remember, shortly before Jumpers, meeting him on the steps of the London Library where he was clutching a pile of books that reached up to his chin. “What is that?” I asked. “My next play,” he replied.View image in fullscreenStoppard in 1990, directing the film adaptation of his play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.Photograph: Ronald GrantWith time, the emotional content of his plays became ever more visible. The breakthrough arguably came with The Real Thing (1982) whichstands up betterthan any of his plays to revival. It raises a whole host of questions such as whether any public commitment is the result of private derangement and whether concepts such as justice and patriotism exist outside our perceptions of them. But behind this – and what makes the play so relatable – is a heightened awareness of the ecstasy of love and the agony of betrayal.With his restless imagination, Tom Stoppard showed us a mind on the moveRead moreEven Arcadia (1993), which deals with determinism and free will, classicism and Romanticism, and a myriad other things, works because it is intensely moving. Ideas and emotion perfectly coincide in a scene where a brilliant young girl, Thomasina, laments the loss of past civilisations to which her tutor replies: “Mathematical discoveries glimpsed and lost to view will have their time again.” And that is precisely what happens, in that Thomasina’s revolutionary revision of the Newtonian universe outlasts her tragically truncated life.Stoppard’s brilliance as a dramatist was rarely questioned. What was debated, especially in the early years, were his doubts about the efficacy of art: something he often discussed in interviews. “I used to feel out on a limb,” he said in 1976, “because when I started to write, you were a shit if you weren’t writing about Vietnam or housing. Now I have no compunction about that. To avert indirectly to Travesties [his 1974 play], The Importance of Being Earnest is important but it says nothing about anything.”I believe he was totally wrong about that since Wilde’s play offers a running commentary on money, marriage, morals, class, the decline of the aristocracy and the ascendancy of commerce. But Stoppard undermined his own argument by writing a number of works that deal to great effect with the abuse of human rights by authoritarian regimes. One of the most astonishing was Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, first performed at the Royal Festival Hall in 1977. It showed a Russian dissident falsely declared insane and locked in a cell with an authentic lunatic who believes himself in charge of an orchestra. It was startling both to see the entire London Symphony Orchestra on stage and to witness Stoppard exposing the cruel absurdities of Soviet oppression with dark humour. As I wrote at the time, “iron is met with irony and rigidity with a relaxed, witty defiance”. Robert Cushman put it better when he later wrote in the Observer that “Mr Stoppard’s gaiety is a moral quality in itself”.View image in fullscreenStoppard accepts an award for best play for The Coast of Utopia at the 2007 Tony awards.Photograph: Gary Hershorn/ReutersBut the idea of Stoppard as a detached, apolitical observer of life was decisively punctured by several works that followed. Professional Foul, shown on BBC2 in 1977, was a beautifully wrought piece showing a Cambridge professor of ethics, played by Peter Barkworth, confronting the real world of persecution in the course of a visit to Prague and recognising that there is such a thing as an instinctive morality based on right and wrong. That play was one of several that were to show Stoppard engaging directly with political issues, acknowledging his national origins (he used to joke that he was simply “a bounced Czech”) and, something he kept hidden in accordance with his mother’s wishes while she was alive, the fact that he was Jewish.The later, more political works varied in quality.The Coast of Utopia(2002) was a hugely ambitious trilogy about revolution that came most alive when dealing with characters Stoppard intellectually disowned: especially the rootless anarchist, Mikhail Bakunin.Rock’n’Roll(2006) was a tighter, better play that suggested that, while the Czechs had fought strenuously for their freedoms, we were gradually allowing ours to slip from our grasp. Stoppard’s final play,Leopoldstadt(2020), was a deeply personal work that dealt, very movingly, with the history of a Viennese Jewish family, which ended with one of its members revealing that he was brought up as an assimilated English boy but acknowledging his true identity.This was Stoppard’s final act of self-revelation. Born in Czechoslovakia, evacuated to Singapore and India during the second world war and finally settling in England in 1946, he had willingly embraced the customs of the country. He loved everything about it, from its countryside and its cricket to its supposed liberal tolerance. If circumstances forced him to recognise his national and racial inheritance, it was of great benefit to his later work and found rich fulfilment in Leopoldstadt.So where does Stoppard stand in the hierarchy of modern British drama? Harold Pinter made poetry out of demotic speech and exposed the subjectivity of memory. Alan Ayckbourn has explored the traumas of middle-class life and exploited the theatrical possibilities of time and space. Tom Stoppard proved that scientific, moral and philosophical ideas could be a source of drama as long as there was a core of genuine emotion. But, while as a dramatist he always raised the temperature of the room, it is no less important to say that he was a kindly, decent and thoughtful human being. My last glimpse of him was just before curtain-up on the second night of a revival of Rock’n’Roll at Hampstead theatre. Stoppard was making his way home, but before he did so, he stopped to have a friendly conversation with the front-of-house staff and to lovingly stroke a dog belonging to one of them. Having made his fond farewells, he exited quietly into the night.Explore more on these topicsTom StoppardTheatreTelevisionBBCRadioComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, given Sir Tom Stoppard’s great love of cricket – which features in one of his most celebrated speeches – it seems fitting to choose a first XI among his works for stage, screen, TV and radio. There is no order of precedence: in cricket, any number on the card can be a gamechanger. (Most scripts are published by Faber; streaming details where available.)1. Arcadia (1993)Stoppard’s most complex theatrical timescale cuts between an English country house in the early 19th and late 20th centuries, setting up delicate echoes and contradictions that explore literature, architecture, mathematics, physics and the elusiveness of historical truth. A joke about a hermit with a curiosity about current events is one of the dramatist’s best and this haunting mid-career piece among his most admired and revived plays.2. Brazil (1985)View image in fullscreenJonathan Pryce as Sam Lowry in Brazil.Photograph: Universal/AllstarComing to England as a child after a fraught childhood in Czechoslovakia, Singapore and India, Stoppard developed a liking for local humour from the Goons through Morecambe and Wise to Monty Python. The latter’s Terry Gilliam hired Stoppard and Charles McKeown to cowrite this brilliant satirical sci-fi film set in a bureaucratic dystopian society. Shared authorship doesn’t dilute a distinct Stoppardian tone: a sort of Kafkaesque-Pythonesque, uniting his native and adopted cultures. (Disney+/Apple TV+).Tom Stoppard – a life in picturesRead more3. The Real Thing (1982)Stoppard’s sixth major play was the first set in a contemporary England. Dazzlingly self-reflective, it is a West End comedy in which a playwright, Henry, has written a West End comedy starring his first wife, to whom he is soon paying alimony after events that play out within plays. A dropped hankie (Othello) exposes a love affair that is then threatened by the temptation of adultery during a production about incest (’Tis Pity She’s a Whore). Regular revivals – most recently at the Old Vic in autumn 2024 – reveal ever more of an ingenious structure in which lines, scenes and props repeat with different, darker meaning about where the truth lies in love, politics and art, Stoppard’s position revealed through the metaphor of a cricket bat.4. Professional Foul (1977)The writer was equivocal about this script, which he wrote in a few weeks after struggling with a BBC TV commission. However – surely calling for a tribute rerun soon on BBC Four – its 85 minutes are one of the writer’s deftest uses of a favourite device – parallel, cross-pollinating worlds. A colloquium of philosophers and linguists takes place at the same hotel in communist Czechoslovakia where the England football team is staying for a vital international. Football fan academic Anderson (Peter Barkworth), who is giving a paper in order to see the fixture, referees complex questions of whistleblowing in the cold war.5. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (1966)Stoppard’s reputation-making play, in common with many that followed, used a classic as a trampoline: two minor attendant lords in Hamlet find themselves in the title and at the centre of a lovely jumbling of Shakespeare and Stoppard lines and scenes. Starting with a time-passing, coin-tossing scene that warps the laws of probability, it foregrounded Stoppard’s comedic skills, leading some to overlook an underlying seriousness: the fifth word of the title is key to this deep reflection on chance and mortality. In cricketing terms, Stoppard’s most prolific all-rounder, it is frequently revived in theatre and is his only play to have become a movie, directed by Stoppard himself, in 1990. (Paramount+, BFI Player).6. Rock’n’Roll (2006)/Leopoldstadt (2020)View image in fullscreenBrian Cox and Rufus Sewell in Rock’n’Roll at the Jerwood Theatre Downstairs at the Royal Court, London, in 2006.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyCricket rules allow a 12th player as an alternate and these two stage plays feel inseparable as alternative biographies of Stoppard. Moving between Cambridge and Prague from 1968-89 (dates of unsuccessful and successful eastern European revolutions), Rock’n’Roll imagines the dramatist’s life if his family had not fled the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia; would he, under the subsequent communist occupation, have been a dissident or a collaborator? Inspired by the writer’s late-life realisation that his family was fully Jewish, Leopoldstadt, though uprooting the Stoppard family tree to Vienna, grapples with having escaped a Holocaust that claimed all four grandparents. A 1955-set coda featuring Leo, a clear authorial surrogate, is one of Stoppard’s most searing and personal scenes.Tom Stoppard, playwright of dazzling wit and playful erudition, dies aged 88Read more7. The Dog It Was That Died (1982)An anecdote has Stoppard being called by Steven Spielberg with a movie script offer for a zillion dollars. The writer regrets that he is under commission to the BBC, triggering incredulity that he would turn down a movie for TV? The reported reply: “No. Radio.” Of Stoppard’s 10 sound plays from 1964-2013, The Dog It Was That Died – about a secret agent who can’t remember which side he’s on – stands out for its site-specific sound effects (a sick donkey scalded by hot tongs stampedes across a living room setting off multiple antique clocks), manic punning (an “unsavoury business” caused by toasted cheese) and the interest in espionage fiction that led to the Le Carré movie adaptation The Russia House (1990) and Stoppard’s own spy stage drama, Hapgood (1988).8. Shakespeare in Love (1998)View image in fullscreenJoseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow in Shakespeare in Love.Photograph: Universal/AllstarStoppard shared credit and Oscar with Marc Norman (who wrote an original version) with this script which extends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead’s exuberant Shakespearean scholarship by focusing on the playwright himself. Until the later alternative memoir plays, this was Stoppard’s most autobiographical work, dramatising, at four centuries’ remove, the practicalities of a dramatic career – boorish producers, preening actors, commissions, rewrites, inspiration, falling in love with actors. (Apple TV+, Prime Video, BFI Player)9. The Coast of Utopia (2002)This vast trilogy about Russian intellectuals in European exile during the revolutions of the mid-19th century was in places overlong and underwritten when premiered at the National. But a shorter, tauter rewrite for Broadway in 2006 – winning Stoppard one of his five Tony Best Play awards – clarified some of the writer’s biggest thoughts on recurrent themes – dissidence, literature, nationality, parental love and journalism – and these revised texts surely soon deserve their UK premiere.10. Parade’s End (2012)Stage and cinema had kept Stoppard from television for three decades when he was persuaded back by material too huge for a movie – Ford Madox Ford’s sequence of novels, Parade’s End, in which a love triangle in London plays out before and during the first world war, giving Stoppard another chance at a favourite theme of lives pressured by history. Written during a nine-year theatrical drought – the longest of his career – it received his fullest attention both at the desk and on set and must feature in the BBC TV tribute. Also notable for Benedict Cumberbatch’s performance as the physically and emotionally wounded aristocrat, Christopher Tietjens. (Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+)11. The Real Inspector Hound (1968)Without declaring it a policy, Stoppard borrowed most theatrical forms – Shakespeare (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern), sex comedy (Dirty Linen, 1976), romance (The Real Thing), musical (Rough Crossing, 1984), thriller (Hapgood). His parodic mousetrap catches Agatha Christie in The Real Inspector Hound, in which theatre critics (Stoppard’s first profession) reviewing a country house murder mystery become involved in the action amid effervescent playing with words and structure.Explore more on these topicsTom StoppardTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But just as she finished recording it, she got a shock diagnosis. She explains why it’s made her determined to be in the momentSat 29 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTShareYou couldn’t make it up,Jessie Jsays. There she was preparing for her first album release in eight years, ecstatically in love with her newish partner, and finally the mother of a toddler having struggled to conceive for a decade, on top of the world. Then in March she was diagnosed with breast cancer.The singer-songwriter, real name Jessica Cornish, is famous for telling it as it is. The album, Don’t Tease Me With a Good Time, was supposed to be an open book, dealing with every ounce of devastation she’d experienced since she last recorded music (endometriosis, miscarriage, failed relationships, gaslighting, suicide) with typical candour. The first single, No Secrets, was released in April. But by then there was a mighty secret. The cancer. Then second single, Living My Best Life, came out in May and Cornish was giving interviews about how she was living her best life, while still secretly living with breast cancer.A month later she went public, and in early July she had a mastectomy.She gives me her best “What the fuck?” look. “I come out with a song called No Secrets. I’m doing every interview, and they’re, like, ‘So what’s new with you?’ and I’m, like, ‘Erm, yeah, nothing …’” Cornish has just had tocancel tour datesbecause she’s still waiting for reconstructive surgery.We’re at a photo studio in London. She is wearing a beige fake-leather jacket, blue jeans with elaborate white patches, cream boots and oversized specs. Think biker chic meets 1970s Nana Mouskouri. “I feel like I’m in the 70s and I should have a boyfriend with a big tache.” Easy Rider, I say, thinking of the film. “That’s what people called me at school!” She grins. Cornish is quick, irreverent and filter-free. She says she has always fancied doing comedy, and is hoping to make her standup debut next year. “I love making people laugh. On stage I basically roast the audience.”Video of Jessie J twirling around in a strapless black dressCornish was preparing for an appearance at the Baftas when she found a lump. “I immediately went to get it looked at, had an ultrasound, and they were, like, ‘It looks like nothing; you’ve got really good dense breast tissue.’ And I was, like, ‘But I can feel it. I’ve got an achy arm and pins and needles in my hands whenever I wake up.’ And they said, ‘Well, let’s just do a biopsy.’ That was 28 March, the day after my birthday.” It was a Friday. The doctor told her if it was bad news she’d call on the Monday. By then Cornish had convinced herself it was nothing. The way she tells it, it was simply too inconvenient to get cancer when she had so much on.“We’re two weeks away from launching this thing after eight years without an album and four years without a single. And she [the doctor] texted and said, ‘Are you free at six?’ And I was, like, ‘Oh, it’s a Zoom, it won’t be anything.’ So I jump on the Zoom thinking it’s all going to be good, and she goes, ‘Are you sitting down?’ You know that sad tone they use? And she says, ‘I’m so, so sorry, but your test results have come back as high-grade cancer cells.’” How did you respond? “I said, ‘Oh, that’s not ideal, is it? That’s not fucking great timing.’ The first thing I thought was, ‘I can’t die because my son needs me.’”Men have called me difficult because I’m a strong person who understands who I amView image in fullscreenDress: AjeShe found the surgery terrifying and absurd. “I hate being put under. They walk you down. You know when you have emergency surgery you roll down in a bed, but this time I just strolled down with a gown on and my bum hanging out. You feel like you’re in an episode of Black Mirror.” But, Cornish says, she’s been lucky. No chemo, no radiotherapy, just the op. “Cancer sucks, man, but you know what? Thank fuck I found it early. I had the mastectomy four months ago and my right breast now looks like a grapefruit under a tight bedsheet.” Another grin. “I got to keep the nipple, though.”The next operation is both medical and cosmetic. Her boobs, she notes, are now “different sizes.They didn’t do an implant as small as my original. Howrude! I thought, no need to bully me, I’m already having a rough time.Sorude! It’s funny because I said I’d never get my boobs done because I’ve got OCD, and I know they’d never be perfect. Cancer ruined that plan.”Cornish is no stranger to illness. She thinks her perspective on the cancer has been so positive because she’s familiar with health crises. They have often coincided with career highs, serving as a tap on the shoulder, or punch in the stomach, to remind her not to take anything for granted. “Honestly, I feel life goes, ‘You having a good time? Sit down.’ Ever since I was a child, it has always gone alongside moments of success for me; something severe or obscure has happened to my health.”View image in fullscreen‘My mum and dad did a great job of making sure my character wasn’t defined by my worst days.’ Top: PatouShe takes me back to her 11-year-old self, already making her debut starring in the West End in Whistle Down the Wind (she was cast at the age of nine). That’s when she was diagnosed with the heart condition Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, which can cause a fast heartbeat as well as dizziness and palpitations. “I was going in and out of rehearsals on an IV drip, and going back into hospital at night.” She fast-forwards six years, and 17-year-old Jess has joined the girl group Soul Deep while attending the Brit School. “I just got my first record deal, and I had a stroke. Then when I was about to put out music in 2020 I had a car crash and my larynx moved up and I couldn’t sing for a year.”Oi, I say, slow down, I can’t keep up. You really had a stroke at 17? She nods. “I was on the train, and my face dropped. I felt awful and I went to the GP, and she said, ‘I think you’ve had a minor stroke, I’m going to call an ambulance.’ I was in hospital for four to five weeks.” She smiles. “I’ve clearly got an addiction to being diagnosed with things. So maybe the cancer is part of that.”Did illness define her childhood? Not at all, she says. “My mum and dad always did such a great job of not making that the definitive thing in my life, and not making me define my character by my worst days. That was amazing and has carried through to now.” Ultimately, she reckons her health issues have been the making of her. “They’ve made me live life more, eat better, work out more. Made me live in the moment.”I notice a tattooed open circle on her left wrist. What does that represent? “My mum, my dad and me got this on my dad’s 60th in New York. It’s a circle of love, and my sisters were too pussy to get it. So now I’m their favourite child!” She clearly adores her family. Cornish, aged 37, grew up in Essex with two older sisters who were more academic than her and were both head girls at secondary school. Their mother was a nursery school teacher; their father a mental health social worker.At 16, she started at the Brit School. Cornish was in the same year as Adele (with whom she sang in lunchtime sessions). In the past, she has said the Brit School was cut‑throat. What does she think students wanted more – to be good or to be famous? “I think people just wanted to be the centre of attention. We were all teenagers who wanted to be the loudest. Everything I wore was green and I’d draw music notes on my face and I was a hair model for Vidal Sassoon. So I literally looked like I was going to Star Trek school dressed as a duck.”Did she like the Brit School? “Ilovedit. You know what I loved the most? That it taught me how to be streetwise because I had to get five trains there every day to get from Essex to Croydon. I had to get up at the crack of dawn, so it gave me discipline. But I loved it. I loved learning, I loved it being different every day, loved not wearing uniform, the auditions. I would audition for everything. That’s how I got into the girl band that got me the first deal.”View image in fullscreen‘I love the success, but I don’t love being famous.’ Dress and shoes: Lanvin. Bangles: Dinosaur DesignsCornish first experienced success aged 21 as part of the team who wrote Party in the USA for Miley Cyrus in 2009. A year later, she had her first hit with Do It Like a Dude. The song was three minutes of promotional self-referencing (“Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey … J-J-J-J Jessie J”), female empowering, male parodying, double-entendre indulging (“Boys, you, you need to lick my dollar … Boys, g-getting hot under the collar”) poptastic filth. This was also her debut as Jessie J.Jessica, Jessie, Jess. I ask her which name she prefers. “Jess,” she says instantly. “I hate Jessie. It’s like a dog’s name. ‘Jessie, come back here!’” She whistles herself over, as if she were a dog. “The J makes it somehow nicer. It changes the whole thing.”Do It Like a Dude was followed by Price Tag, her first No 1 and still her most famous song. Price Tag is infectious bubble-gum pop about the primacy of happiness over money. But Cornish says it is also a critique of the industry she had barely entered. “It was about being a statistic and a number at a record label and it not being about talent or the truth.” She sings a line to illustrate her point, as she often does. “‘When the sale comes first and the truth comes second just stop for a minute and smile.’ I was already tired of contracts. I was so frustrated when I wrote that song. What you were trying to say wasn’t important, it was just about how much money can we make from this person.”There were many more hits including Domino (another UK No 1), Who You Are (a hymn to being true to yourself in the face of knockbacks, and one of her favourite songs), and 2014’s Bang Bang with Ariane Grande and Nicki Minaj (another celebration of female empowerment, and her biggest US hit). After Bang Bang there was one more Top 20 hit … and then it all ended. Single after single failed to chart. Cornish has not had a hit record for 10 years. She went from one of the hottest properties in pop to has-been overnight. How did it affect her? “You know what? I’m actually lucky in that I’ve never given a shit about No 1s or any of that stuff.Ever. It’s just not who I am. And that’s probably why I’ve had so many managers, because so many are like that.”In a way, she says, failure came as a relief. It allowed her to reclaim some of her anonymity. “I love the success, but I don’t love being famous. The hardest part of fame is losing the invisibility you have when you’re not successful that enables you to create the things that make you successful in the first place. So when I dropped off, I had a shaved head, nobody recognised me, I could go back to doing some normal shit.”But she also admits she lost belief in what she was doing. The successful songs from her last hit album Sweet Talker were written by other people and meant nothing to her. “I just retreated and said, ‘I can’t do this no more.’ I just kind of gave up. So I took a break and said, ‘I’m done with the industry.’”She went away and recorded the resolutely uncommercial album R.O.S.E. about “the struggle of finding my feet from the age of 25 to 30”. She loved it, but nobody bought it. “The label didn’t really support me because they didn’t get it. It wasn’t Bang Bang. But some of my favourite songs that I’ve written are on R.O.S.E.”It’s interesting that she says her early music stopped meaning anything to her.Last year, it was reported that she had made £7.6m in 2023, and there was speculation that she had done so by selling the rights to her music. Is that true? “No!!!” She laughs. But Cornish is a useless liar. She looks embarrassed. “I don’t know! Errr. I might have done.” She comes to a stop and, to the tune of Total Eclipse of the Heart, she sings: “Moving on to another question because I don’t know what to say to that one.” I was just curious, I say. “Music’s supposed to come and go,” she says. “Let it go. It’s like your wardrobe. You’ve got to have a little clearout now and again.”View image in fullscreen‘It was a selfish, amazing life I had in LA. Not the kind of life I could maintain with a child and a partner.’ Blazer and trousers: Rebecca Valance. Shoes: Gianvito Rossi. Necklace: Giovanni RaspiniWhile R.O.S.E. flopped commercially, in 2018 she enjoyed her most surprising success when sheentered the Chinese talent contest Singer. By then she was living in Los Angeles and was a distant memory for many of us in Britain. “My managers at the time said, ‘This TV show keeps coming in, and you’d be a special guest’, and I said, ‘Just say yes to it.’ They were, like, ‘D’you want to know more?’, and I was, like, ‘Nope, just sign me up, I need a shake-up.’ And that was it. I thought I was a special guest for three weeks, and I land in China and I’m a contestant on a competition and I didn’t even know. I sang Domino on the first show and won that, then I won the next and the next, and they were, like, ‘D’you want to stay on?’, and I was, like, ‘Well, yeah!’”The show was regularly watched by 500 million people. After 11 episodes, Cornish got to the final, which had an audience of 1.2 billion. She sang I Will Always Love You, and won the contest. It’s such a moving moment when she realises she’s won. A mix of shock, incomprehension (literally because it’s in Chinese) and euphoria. What did winning mean to her? “Oh!To be celebrated as a singer like that, I hadn’t had that before.” Does she think she should have been respected more as a singer? “No, but I always say the people who know I can sing wouldn’t buy my music and the people who buy my music probably don’t know I can sing that way.”Her new music seems incredibly personal. At times, it feels like the songs are private messages to all the people she’s been closest to throughout her adult life.Where does the album’s title come from? “I say ‘Don’t tease me with a good time’ all the time.” She explains it can be genuine, when somebody tempts her with a kind offer. But often it’s sarcastic. She gives me an example. “‘So do you want to have breast cancer surgery?’ ‘Don’t tease me with a good time!’”The song I Don’t Care ends with her monologuing: “So let’s raise a glass to us and to those still finding the courage to walk away from the gaslighters, the abusers, the narcissists.” Who are the gaslighters, abusers and narcissists? “They’re the men in my career and my life that have called me difficult because I’m a strong person who understands who I am.” They said that to your face? “Oh yeah, all the time. 100%.” Was this more in her personal or professional life? “More business. Maybe a couple of guys I dated, but nothing serious. I wouldn’t get serious with someone like that.”In the song Complicated, she summarises the first decade of her career. I quote her lines back at her. “2010 was the year I didn’t know what I was doing. I sang so loud. Insecure, but nobody knew it.” Yes, she says, well, she didn’t, and she did, and she was.In 2012, she sings, she broke up with “my beautiful girlfriend” and “With the press in my face, called it a phase, babe I’m sorry.” When Cornish became famous, she was dating a woman and said she was bisexual. After they split up, she said it was just a phase she was going through, which alienated LGBT+ fans. Thirteen years on, she’s making a public apology – not to members of the public who took offence, but to her ex. She says she worded it clumsily at the time. “It wasn’t me saying I’m not bisexual. I think I’m always going to be attracted to women. I’m so honest and open about it, but I don’t want a label on it, like ‘Jessie J the bisexual singer’.” Is Jessie still in touch with her ex? “No, not any more.” She sounds sad about it. Was she upset when she read that you had said was just a phase? Yeah, I’m sure it hurt her because our relationship was amazing and we were really serious. We lived together for a long time; around three years.”My American friends are scared. They’re not what Trump wants them to look like and be like and feel likeAnd so Complicated goes on. In 2014, she was told everyone hated her, in 2015 she was told she couldn’t have children, in 2016 and 2017 she grieved for herself, and in 2018 she “met a Magic Mike, will that ever be forgotten? Cos everything they write, that’s the headline, that’s the topic.” This is a reference to her then boyfriend Channing Tatum who starred in the Magic Mike films. “I played him the song to see if he’s OK with it and he was.” How does she get on with him now? “Oh, he’s so sweet. Oh my God, yeah! Channing is such a sweet guy. We were such good friends and had such a good time together.” In this relationship, he was the star and she was the plus one. She says it gave her a taste of what it must have been like for some of her former partners. “It did get frustrating. It felt that everything I read about myself was about him.”I tell her I think the song Threw It Away is about him, too. (“I gave you my love/ You threw it away.”) “Haha! That’s funny.” She starts singing it. “Yeah, I reckon there’s probably a little bit of that in there,” she concedes. “But it wasn’t just about him. I dated a lot of people when I was in LA and there were lots of men who were, like, ‘Yeah, ride on my motorbike and I’ll show you around’, and then they just drop you off. That’s the negative of LA.”She spent a decade there – her “solo” years. “It was a really selfish, amazing life I had. But it wasn’t the kind of life I could maintain with a child and a partner. When I had Sky I thought I didn’t want to raise my son away from his immediate family. And my partner’s Danish, so we wanted to be closer to Denmark, too.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m so proud of myself. I went full term. I had a C-section, which I didn’t want, but it didn’t matter.’ Coat: Victoria Beckham at Fenwick. Shoes: Guiseppe Zanotti. Necklace: MishoLast year, she moved back to Britain with her partner, the Danish-Israeli basketball player Chanan Colman, and Sky. “I just felt the new chapter was going to be here. It was the day that Trump got elected that I left. It was the day we planned to leave, so it felt aligned.” Did she want to be far away from him? “As far away as possible, please. I feel awful for the people who are still there. So many of my friends are struggling mentally with America right now. It actually scares me that I can’t even get into that mindset to try to understand what he does. It’s the polar opposite of what I believe in, which is equality and love and everybody having the freedom to enjoy the life they want to.” Does she think Trump is stopping them from living that life? “Of course he is, yeah. So many of my friends in America are scared because they’re not what he wants them to look like and be like and feel like.” And what is that? “Him!”Two of the songs on the album are about the death of loved ones. Comes in Waves addresses the baby she lost, with Cornish singing: “I hate how much I miss the future we never made.” In 2021, when she didn’t have a partner, she got pregnant by IVF, and miscarried after 10 weeks. Was it a tough decision to become a single mother? “No, I wanted to be a mum, and I wasn’t in a relationship. I had endometriosis and I’d done all these tests, and they said, ‘Your egg count is low and if you don’t get pregnant in the next year it’s highly unlikely that you will be able to conceive naturally.’ Obviously, that wasn’t true, because I did in the end.” The lyrics to Comes in Waves are so raw, Cornish wearing her vulnerability like gossamer armour. But it’s also a song of defiance that anticipates the birth of Sky, promising “Next time you come to me I’ll make a place for you to stay”. Again, she sings the line for me. “And I did. I fucking did it. I’m so proud of myself. I went full term. I had a C-section, which I didn’t want, but it didn’t matter.” Does she feel the baby she lost is still with her? “Always.Always. They say the DNA of a baby stays within you, so the bit of that DNA will be in Sky and in me for ever. But I do feel it didn’t happen because I wasn’t meant to do it on my own.”The song I’ll Never Know Why is equally painful. Here she berates herself for not seeing that an unnamed friend was “lost and hopeless”, and she asks him: “How could you say goodbye without saying goodbye?” In 2018, soon after she won Singer, her bodyguard and close friend Dave Last died unexpectedly. I ask her if this song is about him. She nods. Silence. Did he take his own life? Again, she nods, struggling for words. “I miss him so much, man. He was my guy for seven years. He was like my big brother. It makes me so sad that there was a loneliness there that meant it got to that before he would call me. I hope it’s a song that can help people who are left behind. And I also hope it helps people who are thinking of doing it to see a different perspective of what they would leave behind and how much they’re loved and wanted.”Cornish kept herself together while talking about her miscarriage and cancer, but now the tears come. “He was one of my favourite people in the world,” she says. When they were on tour, he was the first and last person she saw every day. “After every show we’d go for a walk and he’d always ask, ‘Have you got your hoodie?’ I’m performing the song at the Royal Variety Show and I’ll be wearing a hoodie.”She calls the album her journey through grief. Although it concludes on a positive note (with songs Living My Best Life and H.A.P.P.Y), it ends before the giddy high of having a baby with Colman. Cornish can’t wait to write about this on her next album. She says she’s never loved in the way she loves Colman. “Birthing someone’s child is so unique. It’s for ever engraved in our relationship because I’m looking at my son and it’s literally his and my face mashed together.

Over 600 pages this “memoir of sorts” ranges from her childhood growing up in the Canadian backwoods to her grief at the death of her partner of 48 years, the writer Graeme Gibson, in 2019, with many friendships, the occasional spat and more than 50 books (including Cat’s Eye, Alias Grace and the Booker prizewinning The Blind Assassin and The Testaments) in between.The author, who turned 86 last week, always likes to take the long view, often from a couple of centuries’ distance. As Rebecca Solnit notes below, she now has a long view of our times. Age and the freedom of being a writer (as she says, she can’t get sacked) make her fearless in speaking out.She always dismisses the notion of prophetic powers –“I’d have cornered the stock market,” she has said(although she did predict the financial crash in her 2008 bookPayback). She certainly doesn’t want to be idolised as a saint – that rarely ends well, and besides, she holds grudges. She even chafes against her mantle as feminist icon, “expected to do the Right Thing for women in all circumstances, with many different Right Things projected on to me from readers and viewers”, as she writes in Book of Lives.Atwood is as hard to pin down as the insects she and her brother, Harold, played with as children, encouraged by her father’s job as an entomologist. A natural scientist (many of her family were scientifically inclined) and sceptic, she is also a dabbler in palm-reading and the occult. There is nothing she can’t tell you about nature, from the sex lives of snails to rare birds (see questions from Jonathan Franzen and Anne Enright); or history – the Salem witch trials and the French Revolution are particular areas of expertise.She can be silly and stern, sometimes within the same sentence, but there is a deep moral seriousness beneath all her work. She supports many good causes, young writers and environmental projects. She still goes to the Arctic Circle each year, and to Pelee Island for the bird migration each spring. Somehow, she has found time to write some of the finest books of the past 50 years: poetry, dystopia, historical novels, speculative fiction, a graphic novel, countless essays and now, finally, a memoir.The author would strongly disapprove of this inventory of her achievements – she is Canadian, after all. But it is by way of saying, it is no wonder that some of our other great thinkers and writers have burning questions – how to cure a hangover? Or topple the patriarchy – to put to her.One final piece of advice from the last epigraph to Book of Lives: “Don’t piss her off, or you will live for ever.”George SaundersView image in fullscreenCongratulations onBook of Lives. Perhaps you remember that long-ago day when you saved me from dying by hangover in a car on the way to Salisbury, by way of some sort of homeopathic remedies? I’veheard you talk masterfully about contemporary biology and philosophy and many other topics, and so admire the way this wisdom permeates your fiction. So, my serious question is: what does your other-than-fiction reading life look like?How have you managed to come to know so much? Also (a follow-up): which pills were those that day?Last Q first: I remember that day well – our drive from Hay-on-Wye – and the very funny but wistful piece you wrote about it for the New Yorker. I’m so sorry you got ambushed by British beer. You were an alarming shade of green. What I did: 1. We put you in the front seat. 2. And advised you to look at the horizon. 3. And stay hydrated.I fed you some pills from the little pharmacy I carry around. Mums do that, and the habit has stuck. I think they included ginger Gravol, used for seasickness; some form of antacid, such as Tums; some kind of hard candy to provide a bit of electrolyte; anything else I thought might help. Not painkillers though; I thought they might make you sicker.How do I know so much? It accumulates as time passes, like fluff under the sofaMy other-than-fiction reading list looks like piles on the floor and various sections of shelving, loosely organised: quite a lot of folklore, mythology, folk ballads, witches, etc, from many countries – a childhood interest that has persisted – I just addedGreenland. A big stash of human rights/second-wave feminism, with some updating; an even bigger section on war, the largest two parts being the second world war (I inherited the collection of my father-in-law the Canadian general, see the storyA Dusty Lunch) and the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars, a current obsession, as I feel we live in a revolutionary era – and no, revolutions are not always of the “left”. Nature stuff – father and brother both biologists, Graeme a bird zealot, which makes me a pedantic and probably annoying person to go for outdoor walks with. (But Merlin and iNaturalist apps have created whole generations of citizen scientists.) Big collections of Canadian writing – fiction, history, poetry – mostly from the 60s, 70s, 80s, then it got too big. Novels from other countries. History of clothing. And on …How do I know so much? It accumulates as time passes, like fluff under the sofa. I’ve always been curious.George MonbiotView image in fullscreenGiven that the great majority of us are not psychopaths, why do we keep electing them to high office, and how do we break the habit?Quite often, in elections, people are not given the choice of something they actually want. So they vote, not for the best, but for the one they think will be the least worst. Not surprisingly, they sometimes get it wrong. And in an age of disinformation (see 18th-century political pamphleteering, just for a fun comparison) the possibility of deciding on the basis of accurate information may be pretty low.Jonathan FranzenView image in fullscreenYou’ve been a strong proponent of new technologies for writers, most notably social media. Has the increasingly malignant power ofbigtech given you any second thoughts?You betcha. Utopian projects – early internet, oh goodie, we can now all share our beautiful and helpful thoughts – frequently go bad, because, surprise, our shared thoughts are not always beautiful and helpful. If we could turn back time … how about to the preagricultural age? Not without its problems either, I’m afraid.Whatbirdhaven’t you seen and would still dearly love to see?The dodo (joke). The great auk (also joke). I’ve never seen an ostrich in the wild, though I have seen a cassowary. How about a European bee-eater? Gorgeous, they say.Right now I have a feeling of: “This is where I came in.” The polarisation of the 1930s, then the second world war. I was born in 1939, so there have been a lot of changes since then!Rebecca SolnitView image in fullscreenOne of the pleasures/horrors of a long life is being a witness to change. What are the greatest changes you’ve witnessed, the ones that most preoccupy you, or the ones you think we should pay most attention to?Right now I have a feeling of: “This is where I came in.” The polarisation of the 1930s, then the second world war. I was born in 1939, so there have been a lot of changes since then! To name a few:1. In 1939 there was hardly any plastic. The first big wave of it broke in the early 50s. Everyone thought it was great.2. The switch from coal to oil in the 50s.3. The advent of television, also in the 50s. Before that it was radio, with families gathered around the set, ears flapping.4. The advent of antibiotics – magic! – and more vaccines, including polio. My generation of children had a lot of “childhood diseases”, including diphtheria, which killed young children. Four of my cousins died of it.5. My generation was all about work ethic. You were just expected to work hard. We thought the 60s hippies were, well, lazy.6. Civil rights in the 60s, however. We approved of that.7. The advent of the pill for public consumption, in the 60s, around the same time as pantyhose, followed by the miniskirt and shortly after that by second-wave feminism. A huge change, hardly possible before the pill.8. With Reagan (1980), the beginning of the end of theNew Dealand the rise of the “religious right” as a political force, thus The Handmaid’s Tale, which many then thought would be impossible in the liberal, free‑world leader, the United States.9. The collapse of the USSR and its bloc, 1989-90. Far‑reaching consequences not apparent at the time. Move one chess piece and all are affected.10. Did I say media changes – in music, from vinyl LPs to tape cassettes and then CDs, and then the advent of the internet and smartphones and social media?And now the rise of authoritarians and totalitarians … as I say, this is where I came in. Pay attention to the patterns of power grabs, infighting, the disintegration of the rule of law. See Macbeth. And I, Claudius. And the wealth and power imbalances just before the French Revolution. And yes, read Nineteen Eighty-Four.

Sorry. Maybe I should have said “cute hummingbird”. But they can be pretty aggressive.If you had been born on theother side of the St Lawrence River, which is to say,in the US, who would you be now?I’d own Connecticut. (Joke. One ancestor was governor there.) Well, I’d probably be one of the Atwoods presently crawling all over Cape Cod, which is where the Canadian branch came from … Hi, Cape Cod distant cousins. But if you meannow, this very minute, I’d be worrying a lot about my country. Is it a democratic world leader on a steep slide into autocracy? Let’s hope not.Deborah LevyView image in fullscreenSimone de Beauvoirwrote: “If you live long enough, you’ll see that every victory turns into a defeat.”Do you think we will ever topple patriarchy?Depends what you mean by topple (all men gone? Japanese female prime minister?) and what you mean by patriarchy (men rule everything? Men are taller, on average?). For me, the Q of the day is rather: can we even hold the line – the line on one side of which women don’t have jobs, money or political rights; and on the other side of which they do?There is no ‘inevitable course of history’. And yes, individuals have made a difference. And can still do. (Though at what cost?)Amitav GhoshView image in fullscreenYour work has prefigured some of the most dystopic aspects of the contemporary world. Do you think this is just the beginning of a total collapse or is a more hopeful turn possible?More hopeful turns are always possible. Except at the moment when you’ve been pushed out a window. But there is no “inevitable course of history”. And yes, individuals have made a difference. And can still do so. (Though at what cost?)Ali SmithView image in fullscreenCan you remember any of the original poems you wrote for your “first opus”,Rhyming Cats, which you wrote when you were very small? Just curious.Yes, but that’s because I’ve seen them recently, in the course of writing Book of Lives.And, curiouser and curiouser: one of the core preoccupations of your wise, humane and prophetic oeuvre, right from the start, has been survival. What tools can we hone right now to help us surface the deluge – from literal climate damage to that of an increasingly savage politics?Inventiveness, the ability to improvise using any materials at hand, and a knowledge of basic needs and possible hazards are always useful. Always have some fresh water in the house. A candle. Some matches or a barbecue lighter. A knife (hunting). When the lights go off, we’re back in time. Not in the 19th century; in the stone age.Savage politics? Wow. I don’t know. Times of chaos produce savage politics. Always have.Diane AbbottView image in fullscreenWill American democracy last?Got me there. I don’t know. But America is a large and very diverse country. It will be hard to make all the Americans line up and salute without killing a lot of people. And the armed forces – as we have just been reminded – take an oath to the constitution, not to an individual. It’s a bit like fairies in Peter Pan. Democracy will die if you don’t believe in it. (But so will money.)Ottessa MoshfeghView image in fullscreenWhat has stayed constant in your craft, and what, if anything, have you deliberately unlearned?I don’t have to use a manual typewriter any more, so I’ve more or less forgotten carbon paper. Other than that: write, revise, crumple, throw out, write, revise … then stop to watch murders on TV.What do you eat when you’re writing a novel?I sometimes forget … snacks (nuts and apples are big) … except when my family is cooking and then blowing whistles to make me come for dinner.And how do you feel about your body?It’s old. Stuff wears out. But compared with the bodies of some of my contemporaries, and despite the pacemaker, it’s not doing too badly. I still have kneecaps, I can still touch my toes and walk 10,000 steps a day. Just not as fast as formerly. (“Still” is a much-used word among us.)Young doctor: “Compared with most people in your demographic, your hearing is quite good.”Me: “That’s because most people in my demographic are dead. They aren’t hearing anything.”Him: (puzzled shock)Ai WeiweiView image in fullscreenHow should we interpret the hypocrisy surrounding the universal ideals of freedom, equality and justice in light of today’s geopolitical realities, wars and acts of genocide?The key word is “ideals”. Ideals are always aspirational. They have never been fully implemented, as we know. I suppose the question to be asked is: do “we” – quite a large category – still think these ideals are a desirable or possible goal? Or are they just verbiage that gets trotted out on solemn occasions?As for hypocrisy, it has been a constant factor in human societies. But there are high points and low ones. Now that we are seeing the greatest democracy of modern times turning away from these ideals, the ideals are looking better as aspirations than they have for a while. What will we do and who will we be without them?Are we about to find out?Book of Lives by Margaret Atwood is published by Chatto & Windus.

This Côte d’Azur travelogue is marvellous funSarah DempsterSat 29 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 29 Nov 2025 02.02 ESTShareAtiny figure is beckoning to us from across a blazing stretch of beach. We approach, tentatively. Who is this squinting gesticulator? Closer inspection reveals a hat (sensible) and a suitcase (brown). The heart leaps. Could it be Paddington? Close. It’sSandi Toksvig. “And this,” she says, as the camera swoops over her shoulder to reveal a gasp-inducing sweep of Mediterranean coastline, “is my Great Riviera Rail Trip”. A montage of coming attractions sets out our guide’s stall. Here is Toksvig eating bouillabaisse in a bib; Toksvig bobbing, seal-like, in an infinity pool; Toksvig pounding up a set of steps, her fringe bouncing like a blond trampette in the breeze. The idea? “I want to explore the region’s rich past and vibrant present,” she says. “A simple rail trip of just over one hundred miles” allows her to take in the artists, writers and “freethinkers” who helped transform the Riviera from a fluttering ribbon of snoozy fishing villages into “one of the world’s dream destinations”.So, it’s all aboard the Toksvig express for the first of a four-part choo-choo along the Côte d’Azur.“It’s going to be,” she says, the sun glinting off the olive in her martini, “hell.”With Sandi’s Great Riviera Rail Trip (Saturday 29 November, 8.05pm, Channel 4), Toksvig joins Joanna Lumley, Romesh Ranganathan, Michael Palin, Joe Lycett, Rylan Clark, Danny Dyer, Dani Dyer, Uncle Tom Cobley and all in the ancient and venerable celebrity TV tradition of going to another country then wearing linen in it. But this is not some blindingly veneered Love Islander guffawing their way across Foreignstan in a tuk-tuk. This is Sandi Toksvig. Not quite a national treasure, perhaps (too abrupt, too politics-y), but certainly skipping towards national trinket status. And effortlessly entertaining company she is too, whether she’s wandering around Edith Wharton’s terraced garden in the hills above Hyères (“Oh, I wish she was here. We could have tea”) or meeting the donkeys helping to keep Plage de Pampelonne free of litter (“What’s this one’s name? Justin? Marvellous.”)View image in fullscreenSandi Toksvig enjoying the Bouillabaisse in Sanary-sur-Mer.Photograph: Luc Tremoulet/Cornelia Street Productions/Channel 4This is not the QI host’s first travelogue, of course.Extraordinary Escapesfound her trekking around the UK in a selection of Britain’s worst cagoules. Still, the series proved conclusively that Toksvig is one of TV’s great pootlers. There are few sights as cheering as the tiny Dane, bundled up in a scarf, ambling merrily around a museum, or scurrying down a continental alleyway, like a Womble that’s just been chased out of a boulangerie following a misunderstanding over an eclair. There are many such trudgings here, the majority of which are undertaken while our be-hatted guide clutches a small suitcase, the contents of which remain a mystery (my guess: marmalade sandwiches). And so we’re off toSanary-sur-Mer, where a local historian shepherds Toksvig through the area’s pre-second world war creative boom, when an influx of exiled German writers turned the dinky port town into a zingy literary salon. (Key takeaway: Sanary resident Aldous “Brave New World” Huxley thought the newcomers were, by and large, wankeurs.) And then? There is bouillabaisse, a boat trip, a brief sojourn to a market square for the obligatory Let’s Watch Some Pensioners Play Boules For A Bit bit and, finally, a visit to a biodynamic vineyard for a restorative gulp of rosé.France on holiday: a day at the beach in Sanary-sur-MerRead moreIt’s jaunty, unfussy stuff, even if there is the occasional sense that we’re not quite getting the full Toksvig. Some of the artier sections feel concertinaed and there are points, such as a scene in which Toksvig reflects on Wharton’s feminist credentials, at which you suspect Channel 4 is waiting for the talking to stop so it can go back to looking at donkeys.But enough quibbling. The sky is blue, the sea a cocktail dress of marbled teal and everyone from Toksvig (“Isn’t this wonderful?”) to Justin (“…”) is clearly having a ball.“What’s not to like about my Great Riviera Rail Trip?” Toksvig asks, peering through her binoculars at the sea, as if suddenly worried a passing crab might have a pop at the bouillabaisse. Nonsense. He wouldn’t dream of it. The answer to her question is, of course, rien. Marvellous.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherSandi ToksvigFactual TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The newly minted version is a swish affair, with a copper-topped bar, distressed wood panels, local craft beers, tacos and a handsome crew of young locals in branded T-shirts. A lot of money has clearly been spent on the refurb, and it seems to be at the forefront of a new wave of developments in the historic village of Llanberis.When Pete Norton and his wife Victoria opened a cafe here in 1978, they envisioned a refuge for climbers, hillwalkers and anyone else who was hungry after a day out on the hills of Eryri. Rain-lashed visitors stumbling in from a long hike could look forward to pint mugs of tea poured from a metal teapot the size of a rhino’s skull, huge plates of steaming chilli and vegetable curry on brown rice, an all-day breakfast or mountainous chip butties.View image in fullscreenThe walls were adorned with black-and-white photos of local crags featuring the UK’s wildest climbers of the day: Andy Pollitt on Lord of the Flies at Dinas Cromlech; Al Harris looking louche on the precipitous cliffs of A Dream of White Horses on Gogarth;John Redheadon the Rainbow Slab in the Dinorwic slate quarries.In the 1980s, Llanberis Pass drew the best climbers from all over the world, and Pete’s Eats was the greasy-spoon temple that welcomed them all. I misspent much of my youth huddled in the window seats next to the jukebox, which rattled out the Kinks’ Sunny Afternoon in counterpoint to the rain hammering at the windows. Every so often wild-eyed, sinewy figures would stumble through the door in a cloud of chalk dust and request the Route Book – the mythical ledger of new climbs where local rock stars would map out and christen their latest conquests.View image in fullscreenLlanberis sits on the banks of Llyn Padarn and at the foot of Yr Wyddfa (Mount Snowdon) in north Wales.Photograph: Alan Novelli/AlamyPete’s Eats came under new ownership in 2018, struggled after the Covid 19 lockdowns and closed for renovations in September 2022. It showed no sign of reopening – a sad sight in a village where it occupies a central position.But in 2024, local entrepreneur Nick Pritchard stepped in to save Pete’s. “We had to do something. I love Llanberis and I’ve watched it struggle year by year because visitors bypassed the village as there was so little on offer in terms of food and drink,” he says. The cafe reopened in July.In the 1980s, Llanberis Pass drew the world’s best climbers, and Pete’s Eats was the greasy-spoon temple that welcomed them allWhile you can still buy the pints of tea that were a trademark of the original Pete’s Eats, the menu also now features cosmopolitan cafe fare such as smashed avocado and eggs benedict alongside the full Welsh breakfast. The staff bring a lot of energy to the place, and you get the feeling there’s a palpable will to make this a success, to make it their own. It’s setting a standard just by existing, especially at a time when local pubs, including the ones left in the village, are still recovering from the aftershock of lockdown.The post office has long since closed as has the much-loved Morris Bros bakery. ThePadarn Hotelbar was the night-time mirror of Pete’s Eats – when the cafe switched off its lights of an evening everyone meandered down the high street and into the Pad. On a Friday and Saturday night you could barely move. The Pad is still popular with tourists, but the riotous Saturday nights have now switched to the village-owned social club Yr Ddraig, a hugely successful bar and venue that regularly hosts live Welsh-language bands, drag acts and Elvis impersonators.View image in fullscreenFuel for hikers and climbers at the new Pete’s Eats.Photograph: Ceri BelshawThe turning point for villages like Llanberis came when holidaymakers who once flocked to Greece, Spain or the Canary Islands began to lean into the idea of a post-Covid staycation. Soon, the usual array of hillwalkers and outdoor enthusiasts were joined by a phalanx of Instagram explorers seeking out mythical backdrops to boost their posts. Almost overnight, social media sent local tourism into hyperspace.Eryri is one of the most Instagram-friendly national parks due to the incredible diversity in a relatively small region. It’s also one of the most filmic: Willow (1988) and Clash of the Titans (2010) were partly filmed here. Then there was the 2019 TV series The Witcher, and for two months this year whole sections of Dinorwig quarry were sealed off when an HBO crew set up camp to film the third season of House of the Dragon.Visitors flock here to try to find a secret waterfall, a primordial cascade surrounded by ferns that’s pure TolkienDinorwig quarryhas been a world heritage site since 2021, a testament to the men who worked and often died there extracting 500-million-year-old slate. There are dedicated viewing points, but the fences that were erected to keep people away from the treacherous holes and pathways have been cut.Visitors flock here to try to find a secret waterfall, a primordial cascade surrounded by ferns that’s pure Tolkien. Last Easter thousands of people swarmed here, with Wales Online blasting that“TikTok over-tourism leaves Gwynedd village besieged”.View image in fullscreenDinorwic slate quarry is one of the sites that make up the Unesco Slate Landscape of north-west Wales.Photograph: Peter Martin Rhind/AlamySlate may not sound like something that will get your teenage kids’ pulses racing, butthe National Slate Museumin Llanberis is an atmospheric place where you can almost feel the ghosts of quarrymen move around you, and an ongoing £21mrenovation of the attractionwill probably further boost tourism to the village.In keeping with Llanberis’s adrenaline-fuelled heritage, newer events such as theUltra-Trail Snowdonia, which started in 2018, have also helped boost visitor numbers. While the finishing touches were being added to Pete’s Eats in mid-June, the village hosted thousands of runners from across the globe competing in four mind-bogglingly hard mountain races that range in distance from 25K to 100 miles. The tagline for the race is “Beautiful beyond belief, savage beyond reason”.The tagline for the Ultra Trail Snowdonia race is ‘Beautiful beyond belief, savage beyond reason’Then in mid-July, the annualRas Yr Wyddfacelebrated its 50th iteration. The race to the summit of the mountain follows the Llanberis Path and back down again. It’s one of the busiest paths on the mountain and runners have to weave through hikers, dogs on extendable leads and selfie-taking groups of charity walkers in matching T-shirts. You win this race by ignoring the laws of physics and placing your faith in the mountain gods by sprinting downhill as fast as you can on ankle-shattering gradients that absolutely want to kill you.View image in fullscreenThe new look Pete’s EatsLike Pete’s, Ras Yr Wyddfa has become an institution. Managed and organised by local businesses and a team of dedicated volunteers, it attracts hundreds of athletes from around the world.The young team in Pete’s Eats has had a busy summer. When I mention to one of the staff that the place was so different back in the day, they nod wryly. “Lots of people have been telling us that. They can’t understand why we don’t have the same menu as before. But most people love it, and nowadays you can get a chilled glass of pinot grigio if you don’t fancy a pint of tea.”They’re right, the cafe has adapted, and the village is the better for it. Much as I loved the spit and sawdust of the old Pete’s, the climbers have changed, the tourists have changed, and I’m reliably informed by my daughter that kids don’t eat chip butties any more.Explore more on these topicsSnowdonia holidaysClimbing holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysWales holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The twice-baked comté soufflé, light and delicately cheesy, is a timeless favourite that’s simple to prepare yet sure to impress. It’s followed by a roast capon, the festive bird of choice in France, prized for its tender, delicious meat, and paired with chestnuts and pommes Anna. These classic recipes are not just reserved forChristmastables, but I think the combination captures the spirit of comfort and indulgence that defines traditional French gastronomy.Chapon rôti, chestnuts, pommes AnnaPrep5 minCook4 hr 50 minSetovernightServes8For the chapon1capon(3-3½kg), with liver and gizzard, or 1 extra-large chickenSalt and black pepper1 black truffle1 tbsp olive oil1½kg fresh chestnuts, or 450g peeled and cooked chestnuts50g butter2 celery sticks1.4 litres chicken stock50g chervil, or parsleyFor the pommes Anna300g butter, or 250g clarified butter or ghee, plus extra for brushing8 large floury potatoes, such as maris piper,Saltand black pepperThe day before, put the butter for the potatoes into a cold pan and slowly bring to a boil, skimming off the froth that comes to the top and leaving the milk solids to sink to the bottom. The clear butter you’re left with is what you want. Transfer the clarified butter to a large bowl.Line a flat-sided nonstick pan or oven dish with greaseproof paper and heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Peel and thinly slice the potatoes to about 1mm thick, ideally on a mandoline, adding the sliced potatoes to the butter bowl as you go. Season generously and mix to coat; the butter might start to set, so keep the bowl somewhere warm-ish; so long as each slice is coated with butter, hard or soft, you’ll be OK.Start layering the potatoes in the lined pan until it’s filled to the top, then cover with more paper and put a heavy pan on top to weigh down the potatoes. Bake for an hour and a half, then check – if a knife goes through the potatoes without resistance, they’re ready. Remove, leave to cool, then put in the fridge overnight to set.The next day, heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3. Remove the liver and gizzard from the capon, rinse the cavity and pat dry. Generously season the inside of the bird, then put the truffle in the cavity, along with the liver and gizzard. Truss the bird securely, then rub the skin all over with oil and season again.Put the capon breast-side up in a roasting pan and roast for about two and a half hours, basting several times.Meanwhile, use a small, sharp knife to slit open the rounded side of each chestnut shell. Drop them into a large pan of boiling salted water, cook for a few minutes, then drain and peel while they’re still warm; make sure you remove both the outer shell and thin inner skin.Melt the butter in a large skillet, add the peeled chestnuts, and stir gently with a wooden spoon to coat. Add the celery ribs, then pour in the stock, cover the pan and leave to simmer gently, without stirring, for 20 minutes. Drain, then remove and discardthe celery.Meanwhile, finish the pommes Anna. Turn out the potatoes on to a baking tray and cook in a 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 ovenfor 20–30 minutes, until golden and evenly crisp all over, brushing with more melted clarified butter to help things along.Five minutes before the capon is ready, add the chestnuts to the roasting pan so they can absorb some of the cooking juices. When the capon is cooked, take the pan out of the oven and transfer the bird to a warm platter. Arrange the chestnuts on a separate dish, and sprinkle them with the chopped chervil. Remove the truffle, liver and gizzards from the cavity of the bird., slice the truffle thinly and dice the liver and gizzards, then scatter all of them over the chestnuts.Transfer the pommes Anna to a platter, sprinkle with salt, then cut into wedges and serve. Carve the capon on a board, then arrange the slices neatly on the platter. Deglaze the roasting pan with 60ml water or stock, scraping up any browned bits, then simmer briefly. Pour the resulting sauce into a sauceboat and serve alongside the capon with the pommes Anna.Twice-bakedsoufflé au vieux comté,salade verteView image in fullscreenMatthew Ryle’s twice-baked comte soufflé, with a green salad.Not essential, but I think this soufflé is best when paired with a crisp green salad.Prep15 minCook1 hr 10 minServes4For the cheese base20g butter20g plain flour100g milkNutmeg,grated100g comté, gratedSalt and black pepper3 egg yolks40g double cream15g dijon mustardFor the leek sauce50g butter1 leek, washed and finely sliced1 garlic clove, peeled and finely grated200g double cream80g camembertFor the soufflésSoftened butter200gegg whiteLemon juice210g cheese base(see above)For the green salad30g dijon mustard30mlwhite-wine vinegar½ smallgarlic clove,grated on a Microplane180mlrapeseed oilJuice of ¼lemonLettuce leavesof your choice, washed, dried and left whole10gdiced shallot5gchopped chivesMelt the butter for the cheese base in a saucepan on a medium heat, then add the flour and cook for a few minutes. Whisk in the milk in stages, then bring to a boil, still whisking. Turn down the heat and simmer for two minutes.Grate in some nutmeg, then mix in the cheese and season. Transfer to a blender, and add the egg yolks one by one, blending until smooth after each addition. Add the cream and mustard, and blend briefly to combine. (If you are making a bigger batch, weigh the sauce into 210g bags, so they’re ready to go for a four-portion soufflé. Drop the bag into hot water to warm up when required.)The cheesy leek sauce can be made ahead of time, too. Melt the butter for the leek sauce in a saucepan on a low-medium heat, then saute the leek and garlic until completely soft but without colour. Add the cream and cheese, season, then leave to bubble for a couple of minutes.Rub four ramekins generously with softened butter and heat the oven to 170C (150C fan)/300F/gas 3½. Using an electric whisk or stand mixer, beat the egg whites and a few drops of lemon juice to stiff peaks. Add a third of the egg whites to the warm cheese base, beating to lighten the mix, then gently fold in the remaining egg whites.Spoon the soufflé mix into the buttered moulds and tap on a work surface to flatten the tops. Put in a bain-marie and bake for 12-16 minutes; if you are using larger moulds, it may take up to 20 minutes. Once cooked, the tops will be golden brown and the soufflés will visibly come away from the sides of the moulds with minimal wobble. Remove the soufflés, then turn up the oven to 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9.Make the dressing: whisk the mustard, vinegar and garlic in a bowl, then slowly beat in the oil. Season and add the lemon juice. Dress the leaves with plenty of dressing, add the diced shallots and toss with your hands until every leaf is evenly coated. Put in a large bowl and sprinkle with the chives.Turn out the cooked soufflés on to trays. They will now sit happily at room temperature, ready to be finished when you’re ready to eat. Pour the cheesy leek sauce over the soufflés and return to the oven for five minutes, untilgratinatedall over.Matthew Ryle is chef/partner atMaison FrançoisandCafe François, both in London.Explore more on these topicsFoodChristmasChristmas food and drinkChickenMeatNuts and seedsPotatoesrecipesShareReuse this content"

This means I no longer do feasts with lots of elements, even at Christmas, but I still adore a showstopper, especially one that the whole table, irrespective of dietary requirements, can enjoy together. This year’s offering is such a centrepiece, an aubergine timbale (timbale means drum) packed to the gunnels with vegetables, rice, nuts, fruit, spices and, should you wish it (you should), one of the finest cheeses to come out of Normandy: Boursin.Christmas aubergine and rice timbaleYou will need a 23cm springform cake tin and two or three large baking trays (or you might need to bake in batches). In advance, you can roast the aubergines and squash and cook everything up until the rice (ie, the onions and spices, etc). Also worth knowing: you can bring this out of the oven an hour before serving and it reheats well in the microwave. Both dairy and dairy-free Boursin are now available.Prep20 minCook1 hr 45 minRest15 minServes8Extra-virgin olive oilFine sea salt1.2kg aubergines(about 4 large ones), 3 cut lengthways into ½cm-thick slices, the other cut into 2cm x 2cm cubes500g butternut squash, peeled, deseeded and cut into 1cm x 3cm slices3 large onions, peeled and thinly sliced6 garlic cloves, peeled and minced20g sage, leaves picked, ⅔ of them chopped, the rest left whole½ tsp ground black pepper1¼ tsp ground cinnamon1½ tsp ground allspice100g tomato puree350g basmati rice, rinsed and soaked in cold water50g shelled walnuts, roughly chopped50g currants150gBoursin, or similar (a vegan one, if need be)Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 and line three large baking trays and a 23cm springform cake tin with baking paper. Put eight tablespoons of oil into a large bowl, add a teaspoon of salt, then mix well. Brush the oil over both sides of the aubergine slices, then lay them out on two of the trays, making sure they’re not overlapping.Put the cubed aubergine and squash in the oil bowl, mix well, then tip out on to the other tray. Roast all the vegetables for 25-35 minutes, until the sliced aubergines are bronzed.Meanwhile, put four tablespoons of oil in a wide frying pan for which you have a lid, then set it over a medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, until soft and golden. Add the garlic, chopped sage and spices, fry for five minutes, then add the tomato puree and cook, stirring, for another five minutes.Drain the rice and add it to the pan with one and a quarter teaspoons of salt and 450ml water. Mix well, cover and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a whisper and cook for seven minutes, until the rice is still a little undercooked.Tip the rice on to the tray with the cubed aubergine and pumpkin, sprinkle over the walnuts and currants, then dot with pieces of Boursin and mix gently.Arrange the aubergine slices over the base of the cake tin, overlapping them slightly and with no gaps, then work your way up the sides, leaving a couple of centimetres of sliced aubergine hanging up and over the edge of the tin.Spoon the rice mixture into the tin until it’s full, then cover the top with more overlapping aubergine slices. Fold in the overhanging bits to seal and enclose.Put a small square of baking paper on top of the aubergines, wrap the top tightly with foil, then bake for 30 minutes.Remove and leave to rest for 15 minutes before serving. Meanwhile, put a tablespoon of oil in a small saucepan on a medium heat and, when it’s very hot, add the whole sage leaves and fry until crisp. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried sage to a plate and sprinkle with sea salt.Unwrap the foil and paper from the tin and place a platter on top. Carefully but quickly flip over the plate and tin, undo the springform catch, then remove the tin.Voilà!Serve with the crisp sage leaves on top.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkMeera Sodha recipesFoodVegetablesCheeseVegetarian food and drinkRiceMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"
