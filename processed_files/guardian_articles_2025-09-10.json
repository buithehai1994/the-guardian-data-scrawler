Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Guardian’s reporter in Gaza describes the dilemma facing her family and others, many hungry, penniless and without transportByMalak A Tanteshin Gaza CityWed 10 Sep 2025 09.57 EDTLast modified on Wed 10 Sep 2025 19.12 EDTShareThe ninth of September is my sister Enas’s birthday, so we were happy this morning, drinking coffee as a family and telling jokes, until we saw the leaflets dropping down telling us to evacuate. So now, instead of preparing biscuits and cakes to celebrate, we are packing for another displacement.TheIsraeli army’s plan to occupy Gaza Citysent me back to memories of the early days of the war: the tension, the terror and the psychological pressure. I am afraid the cycle of displacement will repeat itself again.We have stayed in 10 places since we left our home in Beit Lahia, northernGaza, at the start of the war. A single phrase keeps echoing in my thoughts: “I don’t want to.”I don’t want to live through that again. I don’t want to return to the south: even though it is part of Gaza, we felt like strangers there, our hearts aching for the scent of our own soil.View image in fullscreenPalestinians evacuate Gaza City towards southern areas of the coastal Gaza Strip on 10 September.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty ImagesMy mind shifts to memories of the suffering we endured in the south, living in tents, the heat of summer, the cold of winter, the struggle to secure food and water, the difficulty of accessing electricity and the internet.The first Friday of the war we fled without knowing our destination, consumed by fear, taking only small bags packed quickly with light clothes and some basic essentials. It was an extreme time, when we lived minute to minute in total confusion.This time we knew we must prepare for all possibilities. So two weeks ago my father decided to go south to look for a shelter for us, in case we would be displaced again. He set off on his old bicycle, carrying just a bag with some food and water.View image in fullscreenDestruction from Israeli strikes in central Beit Lahia, Tantesh’s home town, photographed in January 2025.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianThe first thing he noticed was the lack of transport. There are very few cars still operating due to a lack of fuel – a litre now costs 500 shekels ($148), 100 times the normal price. There are even fewer animal-drawn carts on the roads, because most horses and donkeys have died from starvation or exhaustion. Most streets are now just a mix of sand, rubble and stones.Everyone spent their savings on food when famine pushed prices unimaginably high. So most people cannot afford to take anything with them, but if they are displaced without their few essential belongings such as bedding and cooking pots, they won’t have money to replace them either.MapWhen my father reached Deir al-Balah he couldn’t find anywhere for our family. Al-Mawasi is a strip of land just a kilometre wide and it is already packed with displaced people from Rafah and Khan Younis. As he searched, he kept wondering where all the people now in northern Gaza were meant to go.He ended the search with a visit to an old friend from our home town of Beit Lahia who is still in our old displacement area in eastern Mawasi. Abu Ahmed, 46, had decided to stay in the south when we returned home during the ceasefire.But within half an hour, four heavy airstrikes hit a couple of hundred metres away, in the eastern outskirts of the “humanitarian area”. These attacks filled my father with fear. How can the Israeli army tell us to evacuate Gaza City for our safety while it bombs the very places it wants us to go?View image in fullscreenA large number of Palestinians gather to receive food in al-Mawasi.Photograph: Abed Rahim Khatib/Anadolu/Getty ImagesAbu Ahmed told my dad about at least 10 people he knew who had been killed by Israeli attacks in just a couple of days. His neighbour died trying to find a phone signal on top of the same hill we used to climb when we needed to get online.A dawn airstrike killed twin brothers who were classmates of his 10-year-old son, along with their parents, the previous day. Five workers at a nearby farm, one of a handful still operating in Gaza, were also targeted.My father left the area quickly, fearing for his life, and returned north. After two full days of an impossible search for a safe place that doesn’t exist, he returned exhausted, his clothes dirty, his face burned brown by the sun.I can never forget the joy on the day in January when we returned to the north during the brief ceasefire, a feeling still engraved in my heart. I remember the refreshing exhaustion, the comfort that filled me when I took myfirst step back on northern soil.View image in fullscreenMalak Tantesh and her father, Amjed Tantesh, in the ruins of their home in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianView image in fullscreenTantesh surveys the destruction in northern Gaza.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianView image in fullscreenTantesh with family members in northern Gaza.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianAt that time, we as civilians tried to bring life back to our demolished town, Beit Lahia. We created new memories, with serious attempts to repair the destruction caused by the Israeli invasion. It felt like being born again.But then war resumed and with it displacement, hunger, fear and suffering. A tank shell killed my dearest uncle Bahjat, 57, when he and my father were collecting some of our possessions from an old shelter, our family’s worst loss so far.View image in fullscreenPalestinians returning to north Gaza in January 2025 during the brief ceasefire.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianMy father survived the attack miraculously unharmed but we could not stay in Beit Lahia for long. Forced out by the approaching bombs and shelling, we had to move to Gaza City.We rented an apartment, so our living conditions were better than those of hundreds of thousands of people with regards to water, electricity and the internet, but we shared their hunger as food vanished from the markets.That hardship eased for us after the crossings were reopened and some aid and commercial goods were allowed back in, but the prices were not affordable for everyone. The most vulnerable didn’t taste these privileges.View image in fullscreenBuns baked in the Tantesh family’s Gaza City apartment when sugar became available again.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianThen came the escalation of attacks on eastern neighbourhoods of Gaza City and news of the Israeli plan to fully occupy it and displace all residents to the south. People were drowning in questions that have no answers.Even if they want to leave, people are too poor and weak. Thousands of families are surviving on just one meal a day, usually lentils. If they cannot even afford food, how can they possibly afford the cost of displacement, which requires at least 2,000 shekels just for transport?Our return to the north felt like an impossible dream come true. We were still displaced but could find the warmth of home in the streets and alleys of Gaza City. We were among relatives and friends, surrounded by clothing shops, cafes and the few remaining beautiful places. None of this exists in the south, where all you see are tents, with no space to escape the harsh and painful reality.View image in fullscreenThe view over Beit Lahia from the roof of Tantesh’s grandfather’s house in February 2025.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianIf we are displaced again, we know they may never let us return. We feel it strongly. They will turn what remained of Gaza City into ashes, as they did with my city, Beit Lahia, and the surrounding northern towns of Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun.They will erase it from existence, destroying every trace of life, human, animal and tree. They will turn it all into grey rubble. When these thoughts cross our minds, we are overcome with grief and anger, frustrated with a world that could stop this but chooses instead to watch from afar.We dreamed of being asked to return to our towns and neighbourhoods instead of going south. We hoped for a ceasefire to end this nightmare once and for all. We prayed for a miracle to foil the Israeli plan. Yet, once again, we are packing to leave.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was a time to count his minimal blessings. Principally that he wasn’t the French prime minister. That is a zero-hours contract job. You’re lucky to survive a three-month probationary period.But even Keir can’t have been expecting to be thoroughlyduffed up by Kemi Badenochat prime minister’s questions. That’s just never been part of the script. The whole point of the Tory leader was that she had always been Keir’s strongest ally on a Wednesday lunchtime. Guaranteed to miss every trick. Miss every open goal. Only last week she had failed to land a significant blow when Angela Rayner was fighting for her political life. It was Kemi who kept Angela in a job for an extra day.Still. A stopped clock is right twice a day and all that. So sooner or later Kemi was almost bound to get it right atPMQs. And this Wednesday she managed to get all her ducks in a row. She was well prepared. She dispensed with the scatter-gun technique and fine-tuned her questions. Her own backbenchers couldn’t believe what they were hearing. Their cheers sounded almost genuine. This won’t be enough to save her job. Many insiders think she will be gone by Christmas. But she will have something to put on her career highlights resignation show-reel.You could argue that Keir might have seen this coming. If not at PMQs then at some other time. It was never a matter of if. Only of when. Hubris in waiting. It may have seemed a good idea at the time to sendPeter Mandelsonto Washington. After all, the prime requirement for a British ambassador was sycophancy. Donald Trump likes nothing more than people who fawn over him. And in Mandy there is a man who was born to fawn. He’s yet to find a rich and powerful person by whom he hasn’t been impressed.Mandy’s reputation as a fixer-in-chief – a man who knows how to oil the wheels of government – is largely self-invented. He’s been bitten not once, but twice. Having to leave the cabinet on both occasions. The first for failing to declare a loan from Geoffrey Robinson. The second a passport scandal involving the Hinduja brothers. Rich men on both occasions. Wealth is Mandelson’s fatal attraction. You’d have thought someone might have seen a pattern there.And here we are again. You would have thought that someone in theLabourgovernment might have smelled a rat before sending Mandy over to the US. After all, even Donald Trump managed to dissociate himself from Jeffrey Epstein long before his lordship got round to it. What does that say about his moral radar?1:31Kemi Badenoch presses Starmer on Peter Mandelson's suitability as US ambassador – videoOr maybe Starmer didn’t really think it mattered. That Trump and Mandy would get along just fine precisely because they had no moral standards.Mandy had been always happy to give a mega-wealthy convicted paedophile the benefit of the doubt. Because that’s what old friends do for one another. Solidarity, brother.Now – as it always does with Mandy – it’s beginning to unravel again. The dirty secrets are becoming public. The creepy letter to Epstein, signed off by “your best pal”. The rumours of more to come. And suddenly a slew of shallow apologies from Mandy. He wishes now that he had never met Epstein. Hmm. Yet again an abdication of personal responsibility. He was powerless when near Jeffrey. He had no control over his behaviour. Others might have taken one look at Epstein’s lifestyle and reputation and run a mile. His lordship was like a moth to a flame. Helpless. Really it was all Epstein’s fault for ever being born.Even then it might have been possible to credit Mandy with a flicker of genuine remorse. Only you just had to look back to an interview Mandelson had given to the Financial Times. Asked about his relationship with Epstein, Mandy got sniffily defensive andtold the journalist to fuck off. So much for any concern for Epstein’s victims. It seems that when it comes to apologising, the only person he feels really sorry for is himself. The unluckiest man alive.Armed with all this, Kemi went for the kill. Was Mandelson the right person to be our ambassador to the US? What did the prime minister know of Mandy’s relationship with Epstein? What vetting procedures had taken place prior to his appointment? Where was the morality in all this? And didn’t we owe it to the victims to sack him? The ambassador should be in the White House talking to the president about Poland and Qatar. Not giving video interviews to the Sun to try to save his career for a third time.Keir looked surprised by the ferocity of the attack. And its forensic precision. Not Kemi’s usual trademarks. His replies were totally inadequate. Forced to defend a man whose resignation he would be demanding if the roles were reversed. Full process had been observed throughout, he said sullenly.What the hell did that mean? That Mandelson had told his interview panel all about his long relationship with a convicted paedophile and the government had said: “You know what, let bygones be bygones. Anyone can make that sort of mistake”? As for the morality, Starmer said that the victims of Epstein’s crimes had been uppermost in his mind. No doubt he then thought: who cares? Far better to have a man in Washington who was on the same wavelength as The Donald and who could chat about the good old days Chez Jeff. Morality a distant cousin to diplomacy.Come the end, Starmer completely lost it. Started telling Kemi that she should have adopted this level of questioning over Rayner the previous week. Almost an admission that he should have sacked Angela before she had a chance to resign. His former deputy could have done without that lack of support. But for now Mandy apparently retains the prime minister’s confidence and will be taking centre stage at Trump’s state visit next week. At this rate it won’t be just Mandy that Mandy takes down. It will be those around him, too.Explore more on these topicsPMQsThe politics sketchPeter MandelsonKemi BadenochKeir StarmerLabourHouse of CommonsForeign policycommentShareReuse this content"

But sometimes, things get far, far more brutalStuart HeritageWed 10 Sep 2025 11.08 EDTShareIt shouldn’t really be a surprise that South Park has become“the most important TV show of the Trump 2.0 era”. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have spent decades taking any potshot they like at whoever they choose, from Saddam Hussein to Guitar Hero to – thanks to their inexplicable 2001 live-action sitcomThat’s My Bush!– other sitting presidents.But by using every episode in its latest series to focus their fury solely at the current US administration, hitting Trump with a combination of policy rebuttals and dick jokes (and daring him to sue them in the process), this is the strongest sense yet that Parker and Stone are out for nothing less than full regime change.Let’s not pretend that South Park is the first cartoon to attempt this, though. For almost a century, animation has often proved to be a better satirical weapon than anything made with flesh-and-blood actors. There is a sense that, to some, George HW Bush will be remembered by the mauling he received at the hands of The Simpsons,which depicted him as a gullible, uptight neighbourafter he dared to criticise the show during a speech on family values. You could argue that the show pulled its punches a little – his episode, Two Bad Neighbors, didn’t air until he had been out of office for three years – but the anger is still palpable.View image in fullscreenNo double entendre … Donald Trump in Sermon on the Mount, episode one of season 27 of South Park.Illustration: South Park StudiosSimilarly, even though Seth MacFarlane’s American Dad has been going for so long (388 episodes and counting) and its satire has long since softened into screwball sitcommery, it’s important to remember that his series came to fruition as a response to the George W Bush administration in the wake of 9/11. The protagonist is a patriotic Republican CIA agent hellbent on enforcing homeland security no matter what. In season three, he performed aSchoolhouse Rock-style songaboutthe Iran-Contra scandalthat may well qualify as the best entry-level explainer of the subject ever made.The fact that these worked where That’s My Bush! failed might be down to the fact that they are animated. “I think there’s a spectrum,” says Dr Adam Smith of York University’s Research Unit for the Study of Satire. “On one end, you’ve got film, where you’re seeing an actual representation of the thing you’re satirising. And on the other end of the spectrum, there are things like abstract poetry, where the viewer has to work harder to figure out what the thing means. Visual comedy, like cartoons and caricatures, is on the direct end of the spectrum, so you get the message in a split second.”View image in fullscreenBorn in the USA … the cast of American Dad.Photograph: Everett Collection /AlamyThis is partly whySouth Parkis succeeding in tackling Trump; while drama and journalism might grapple with the totality of Trump’s instincts and temperament, South Park can depict him as a horny psychopath with a tiny penis, and it lands all the harder.The approach is in huge contrast to their depiction of Trump during his last term. Back then, the show largely avoided him, instead drawing in the elementary school character Mr Garrison as a Trump character. As Dr Smith explains, that was a far more traditional way of tackling a government.“A lot of satire as we understand it today relies on allegory or double entendre,” says Smith. “This evolved in the 18th century in response to libel laws. It’s a way to critique the thing without being prosecuted for the thing.”But this time around, South Park is going in two-footed. This season’s Trump isDonald Trump, animated with a photo of his face. This doesn’t leave much room for allegory.“What they’re doing now is the opposite of how satire normally works,” Smith continues. “It’s almost like they’re trying to get prosecuted, isn’t it? The satirical act of this new series is the baiting of Donald Trump. If they can get the president of the free world to try to sue them, it reveals that he’s not got a good sense of humour. It reveals he’s petty. It reveals that he’s ridiculous. So the critique will actually be in the way he responds.”View image in fullscreen‘When it went out on BBC Three, the commissioner hated it’ … Comedian Imran Yusuf’s animated sitcom Union Jack.Photograph: Imran YusufOf course, these are very American examples of satire, bright and funny and direct. It’s telling that British efforts to mimic this approach tend to be rooted less in longform series and more in sketch. Spitting Image is the prime example here, which was able to crystallise the perception of several leading politicians for 12 years in the 80s and 90s. But even this has cooled of late. BritBox’s Spitting Image revival died on impact in 2020, and other attempts at animated sketch satire (like 2DTV and Headcases) similarly failed.The comedian and philosopher Imran Yusuf attempted a version of this with his 2014 animationUnion Jack, about a British man who – proving some subjects never fully go away – is aggressively suspicious of his non-white neighbours. “We wrote a couple of scripts and tried to pitch it, but everyone turned it away. When it went out on BBC Three, the commissioner hated it,” says Yusuf. “Britain is terrified of doing what the Americans do in regards to political satire and animation. Why don’t we have The Simpsons and Family Guy and American Dad and South Park? Part of the problem is, and this is where it gets really hairy, if a black or a brown writer writes political satire that satirises white politics and white culture, there’s going to be less commissioning will to make it happen.”View image in fullscreenBanned … Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyStill, it could be worse. Elsewhere in the world, where authoritarian regimes tend not to enjoy direct insults, animators have long since used other methods to get their point across. For example,Marjane Satrapi’s film Persepolis, about a young girl struggling to come of age against the backdrop of the Iranian Revolution – which it depicts unflatteringly – could only have been made outside Iran. Indeed, upon release it faced bans in Iran and Lebanon, and in recent years schools in some American states have attempted to ban Satrapi’s original graphic novel from schools.Elsewhere, artists have had to use metaphor and symbolism to slip the net. During its time spent under military dictatorship from the 60s to the 80s, Brazil’s government suppressed political art, so artists were forced to obfuscate their point. This resulted in work likeVendo OuvindobyLula Gonzaga. On the surface, the film is simply a rudimentary cutout of a face. However, as soon as you key into the context in which it was made, you realise that the face can see and hear but not speak. In other words, it’s a reflection of life under authoritarian censorship.But sometimes even this doesn’t work.Dimensions of Dialogue, a short film by the Czech film-maker Jan Švankmajer, was an abstract depiction of, among other things, one clay head sharpening its tongue on another clay head. Despite containing no specific message, it was made in explicit defiance of the Czechoslovak Communist party’s preference for social realism in animation. And it worked; the party not only banned it, but used it as an example of the sort of thing it wouldn’t stand for.View image in fullscreenAbstract … Czech film-maker Jan Švankmajer’s Dimensions of Dialogue.Photograph: Kratky Film/RGR Collection/Mary Evans/AlamyTellingly, the White House reaction to South Park has been the exact opposite: JD Vance and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement chose to tweet about their depiction rather than try to erase it from existence.But, as Dr Smith says, the fact that the administration is attempting to laugh along with it doesn’t mean that the satire has failed. “I suppose it depends on what the point of satire is,” he says. “You always get these questions like, does it change anything? I think it’s too soon to say. My preferred explanation when people ask about the value of satire is that, if you engage in enough satire, it makes you incredulous. Perhaps the ultimate goal of South Park is not how JD Vance or Ice reacts, but the people who have watched it and thought about it. Are they going to be more critical in their day-to-day lives as a result?”With this in mind, something like South Park, which has the ability to go after Donald Trump so aggressively that nobody can misunderstand its point of view, is something of an outlier. But if America does slip into full-blown dictatorship, as with Brazil and the Eastern Bloc before it, this might all change. In other words, if you like your animation satirical, now might be the time to get into abstract clay heads.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionSouth ParkAnimation on TVUS politicsDonald TrumpCensorshipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

During one walk he was exceptionally creative – unconsciously. As he strode along, a stanza came to him, and almost immediately afterwards a second stanza wafted his way. He saw the words in front of him and had only to note them down. He knew he wanted to write a poem with four stanzas and after he’d written out the first two and had a cup of tea, he set off on a second walk. The third stanza occurred to him, and again he didn’t have to make any conscious effort. He waited on tenterhooks for the fourth and final stanza that would complete the poem.It failed to arrive.After three stanzas, the unconscious apparently felt it had done enough and Housman’s conscious mind would have to think of the fourth for itself. The Muse had flown. It took Housman a year to create a fourth stanza that he felt came somewhere close to the level of the others.The surprising role of the unconscious in creativityOne of the most marvellous properties of the brain is its ability to continue working unconsciously when the conscious mind has moved on to something else. I’m not talking here about basic processes such as the regulation of breathing or the control of motor functions during a walk, but about higher cognitive processes. If you ponder the solution to a management crisis and take a walk around the block, your brain will persist in looking for answers. If you think about an explanation for the unexpected results of your latest research and need to attend a meeting, your unconscious will plough on while you try to focus your attention on what the chairperson is saying.In 1926, British thinker Graham Wallas published a book called TheArtof Thought that is still frequently used by psychologists today. Wallas divided the creative process up into four phases.Preparation:The first step is to set goals, to gather knowledge and get your brain moving. Some people call it “saturation”. You must fill your head with knowledge until you feel dizzy and there’s no room for more. The chef who is going to put together a new menu must pluck, smell and taste, read books by other chefs, scour the internet for information about new ingredients, investigate all possibilities.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Incubation:Wallas calls the second phase “incubation”; I have adopted it from him and it’s this second phase we look at here. Important steps in science and art are usually taken at the point when two or more previously unrelated elements are brought together. This demands an unusual way of thinking. You need to let your unconscious do the work; it will apply its powers to all the information you’ve stuffed into your head, just as a casserole can simmer away quietly for hours after you’ve put all the ingredients into the pot. Hours may become days, or months or even years.Illumination:The third phase, illumination, is when your unconscious has completed the incubation period and comes up with a solution, or with an idea. Eureka! The manager wakes up one morning and within minutes, under the shower, realizes what the best first step would be to bring two mistrustful organizations closer together.Verification:Verification is the final phase, in which we take a critical look at what we’ve thought up. A chef can have decided that he wants to make a chestnut tart with quince, pine nuts and liquid chocolate, but he still needs to translate the image in his head into an actual dish.Why the‘incubation’stage is so importantOver the years, the incubation process has fascinated many thinkers, mainly because it happens out of sight. Everyone understands that we make progress on a task if we think about it consciously. That’s intuitive. The fact that this progress can happen unconsciously is less obvious. It’s fascinating, but also spooky.Experiments with unconscious thought have been done using all kinds of choices and decisions. In one remarkable series of experiments, lie detection was studied. We know that it’s exceptionally difficult to detect whether a person is speaking the truth. In studies, short clips were used of people telling a tale. Half of them had been instructed to tell the truth; the other half to tell a made-up story. If you show such clips to other people and ask them to say who is lying and who is speaking the truth, you discover that people are incapable of telling the difference. They are right in an average of 50% of cases, rarely doing any better than you would expect based on chance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There were three groups. The first group had to pass judgement immediately after seeing the clip; members of the second group were allowed to think about it for a while; and the third group was given a distraction task and could therefore set the unconscious to work.The first two groups got the answer right an average of 50-55% of the time, but members of the third group, the group of unconscious thinkers, were right in 65-70% of cases.The three requirements for productive incubationWhat are the preconditions for a productive incubation process?Motivation:Unconscious thought occurs only if we are motivated. To use the romantic terminology of long ago, you might say that the Muse arrives if we immerse ourselves, if we truly want her to come. We need to surrender ourselves as fully as possible to the Muse. She will judge whether our devotion is fervent enough, and only once we have gained her approval will she come to help us. Not otherwise. If we don’t want it badly enough, the Muse will not whisper anything in our ears.Expertise:We also need expertise if we are to engage in unconscious thought. A person who has no understanding of theoretical physics can stuff their head with recent articles and listen to podcasts by top scientists, but the unconscious won’t be able to do much with that information. It probably won’t even comprehend it. A person who has never written a poem and decides to start will have to build up knowledge in order to be inspired by poems by others.You could compare the relationship between stimulation and incubation with Lego. What is done unconsciously (incubation) with new information that is processed (stimulation) depends on what is already there. New Lego bricks must be clicked onto old ones. Only then will a structure arise.The experts: artists on 20 easy, mind-expanding ways to be much more creativeRead moreRelaxed activity:If you look at the working habits of writers and artists, it will strike you how many of them take daily walks. It seems likely that relaxed activity stimulates unconscious thought.Unconscious thought works optimally if we do something that relaxes us, something that doesn’t require too much mental capacity (a little is fine) and puts us in a pleasant frame of mind. We mustn’t be too euphoric, but we must feel good. If we are out of sorts, the unconscious is less cooperative. First, a negative mood causes us to narrow our minds. This has a function: a sense of negativity is a signal that we have a problem. We home in on that problem in order to solve it. Moderately positive emotions signal that things are going well and we can think freely. Extremely negative emotions also absorb processing capacity. If you are seriously worried about your partner’s health and waiting for the results of hospital tests, you can’t work on something that requires brainpower and creativity, whether consciously or unconsciously.You can fill your head, you can be tremendously keen to move forward, you can choose the right way of relaxing and thereby set the unconscious to work. If you are waiting for an idea, for inspiration, or for a solution to a problem, you can certainly increase the chances of it arriving. But this is not a law of nature.Housman may not have got his fourth stanza handed to him on a plate, but the first three needed only to be plucked out of the air. From time to time, our unconscious presents us with something brilliant: a poem, a solution to a problem we’ve struggled with for years, or a scientific insight that helps the world to move forward.

Do these serve a need – or just encourage paranoia?Lucy KnightWed 10 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTShareEarlier this year, the deodorant brand Sure launched a product to be used on “ta-tas”, “trotters”, and “marbles” (AKA breasts, feet and testicles). “Whatever you call them, wherever you smell”, Sure Whole Body deodorant can help, aplayful TV advertpromised.It’s not a completely new concept: many of us will remember the intense whiff of a liberally applied “body spray” – the deodorant-cum-fragrances brought out by brands such as Lynx, Charlie and Impulse that were popular in the 00s. But specific deodorants for body parts other than the armpits weren’t really a thing until 2018, when an American obstetrics and gynaecology doctor founded Lume Whole Body Deodorant, after repeatedly seeing patients who were worried about odour “below the belt”. Sold as a roll-on, cream, spray or wipes, it can apparently be used on “pits, underboobs, belly buttons, butt cracks, vulvas, balls, feet and more!” On its website, it has more than 200,000 five-star reviews – and now the mainstream deodorant brands are following suit.View image in fullscreenSpray or shower? Most people shower at the gym after a workout, so don’t need body sprays.Photograph: Posed by model; Science Photo Library/Getty Images/Science Photo Library RFIn July, Lynx launched its own “lower body spray” which, ifits advertis anything to go by, smells so good that it will have people leaning in to sniff your bottom, crotch and feet. The ad starts with a basketball player who is so distracted by the scent of another player’s crotch that he forgets to defend, instead enjoying the opportunity to get up close and personal with his opponent’s shorts as he leaps up to the basket. Later, a woman crawls across a cinema aisle to follow a man shuffling to his seat, so that she can keep her nose close to his backside.The past two years has also seen whole-body deodorants launched by Dove, Old Spice and Secret. Then there’s AKT, the deodorant balm that partnered with the Team GB rowing team during the Paris Olympics, which is lauded chiefly for being a natural deodorant (another expanding market) whose promotional material also boasts that it can be applied “from head to toe”.“Trust me, you’re going to love it,” the LA-based influencer Nicole Bennetttold her TikTok followersearlier this year as she advertised Dove’s Whole Body Deo, explaining that it can be used “anywhere you need to freshen up”. UK-based Bella Hill uses similar language inher video promoting Sure’s product, praising the way the deodorant can be used “wherever you need it”. Monique Rossi, the general manager of Unilever’s deodorant brands (which include Sure) in the UK and Ireland, says consumer research identified that “one of the top needs” in the deodorant category is freshness, which is why the whole-body product was developed.But is this actually something weneed? Most of us have been getting by with just the underarm stuff, which seems to be, by-and-large, effective – it’s not as if we’re still carrying medieval-style nosegay bouquets wherever we go to ward off the stench of others.“I wouldn’t say this is something consumers want, so much as something consumers are beingmadeto want,” says Jessica DeFino, a beauty reporter and Guardian US columnist. Someone might watch Hill’s TikTok video, for example, which begins with a confessional, “Does anyone else get a bit insecure about smelling bad in the gym? Because I do”, having not previously worried about what they might smell like in the gym, knowing they will take a shower afterwards. But, once the idea that theyshouldbe smelling fresh at the gym is in their head, they might also seek a solution to that “problem” they didn’t previously know they had.View image in fullscreenFeeling insecure? Do your ‘marbles’ really need deodorising?Photograph: Oleg Elkov/AlamyFor the vast majority of people, whole-body deodorants are not necessary, says Michelle Spear, a professor of anatomy at the university of Bristol. “Human bodies are designed to sweat and, in most cases, that’s healthy and normal.” Body odour happens because of sweat and bacteria on the skin’s surface that form part of the skin’s natural microbiome – which can help fight infection and regulate our immune response.We have two main types of sweat glands: the ones all over our bodies are called eccrine glands, which produce a watery sweat that helps with cooling. The other type, apocrine glands, are the ones that can make us smell bad, as they secrete a thicker fluid which, when broken down by bacteria, creates odour – but they are concentrated in the armpits and groin. “That’s why underarms are usually the focus of deodorant, not the whole body,” Spear says.There’s nothing unsafe about using a whole-body deodorant, “if used as directed”, Spear says, as most of them are made without the high concentrations of aluminium salts used in antiperspirants, which would be too harsh on areas of the body where skin is thinner or more sensitive. People with eczema or sensitive skin should be cautious before using them, though, and users “should always patch test before using widely”, she advises.However, these products are “not cheap”, Spear points out and, while it’s a personal choice to use one, “no one should feel they are somehow unclean if they aren’t using them”. If someone is washing daily and using an underarm deodorant or antiperspirant, but is still struggling with body odour, that could indicate an underlying medical condition, Spear explains, which needs to be investigated properly, rather than masked with a whole-body deodorant.London-based dermatologist Noman Mohamed, who posts on TikTok and Instagram as@drnomzzy, agrees that a whole-body deodorant is “by no means necessary as we don’t stink everywhere”. He is critical of deodorants in general, which “only mask body odour” as opposed to antiperspirants, which temporarily block sweat pores. Contrary to common usage, he recommends applying an antiperspirant before going to bed at night, “as that’s when the glands are less active and therefore easier to plug. Less sweat means less food for the bacteria, resulting in reduced body odour.”Mohamed has noticed an increased interest in whole-body deodorants on social media, which he thinks is part of the boom in “self-care” and an increased focus on personal hygiene that has become particularly prominent after the Covid-19 pandemic. “Companies have latched on to this desire to give people what they want and make a tidy profit while doing so,” he says.Rossi says Sure’s whole-body products “were developed in response to consumer insights that shoppers were looking for products that delivered malodour protection for different parts of the body beyond just their underarms”, noting that “people don’t always like to talk about it, but odour affects us all in different ways”.Mohamed thinks that as talking about body odour has become less “taboo”, it has helped create more of a conversation about people’s anxieties around it – creating a space for companies to jump in and “solve” these worries with a product. On social media, body odour and personal hygiene are “now freely discussed with opinions and tips or tricks being shared across all platforms”, he says.View image in fullscreenWhat a whiff! Apocrine glands are located in your armpits.Photograph: PeopleImages/Getty ImagesPerhaps it is the increase in such conversations that has led to the development of deodorants and antiperspirants with ever higher protection times, with many now claiming to last 72 hours, and some, such asTriple Dry’s Classic roll-on, advertising a whopping 100 hours odour-free. Such promises are appealing because they offer “convenience and reassurance”, Spear thinks. People like “the idea that you’ll smell fresh no matter what life throws at you. But, realistically, our skin is designed to sweat, shed, and renew itself daily.”Spear warns that using a product that masks odour for days “isn’t a substitute for washing, and could cause irritation or a disrupted skin microbiome if people rely on it instead of normal hygiene”.The response on social media to the influx of whole-body deodorants has been mixed – with some dismissing them as “marketing ploys” and others saying they have been a gamechanger for “boob sweat” or symptoms of menopause. One Reddit userposted about finding Lume helpfulin the lead-up to their hysterectomy, when they had to wear menstrual pads at all times. “I sometimes got a body odour smell in the creases where my legs and crotch meet,” the post read. “I was showering daily and wearing clean clothes but it didn’t matter. I bought some Lume and it solved the problem. Not having to deal with occasionally smelling bad on top of everything else I was going through was one less thing on my plate.”Spear can see that in specific situations, taking a further hygiene precaution such as using a whole-body deodorant might appeal – for example, people living in hot climates, or those with conditions such as hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) – “but even then, they’re more of a preference than a requirement”, she says.Despite the fact that we don’t necessarily need these new products, the expansion of the deodorant market plays into a wider focus on the hygiene and beauty of our private parts, DeFino adds. It might have seemed ridiculous to many readers of the writer’s Substack in late 2023, when her 2024 beauty predictions included vaginal and anal cosmetics (“butthole beauty”) becoming huge, but “the industry has proven me right”, DeFino says, with large growth in these categories over the past few years, “maybe, most notably, from full-body deodorant balms, sprays, wipes”. Though such products can be applied to any part of the body, a lot of the advertising suggests users might apply them between their legs.View image in fullscreenBewildering … it’s hard to know what is best to choose when faced with a large array of products.Photograph: Posed by model; shironosov/Getty ImagesPerhaps this was an inevitable step for Lynx, which has always traded on sexiness: its 2011“fallen angels” advertsaw beautiful women with wings and haloes plummet to Earth towards the irresistible scent of Lynx-wearing men. But, by equating desirability with this latest product – especially given that Lynx is marketed primarily towards teenagers and young men – the brand is arguably capitalising on its target customer’s vulnerabilities. In the same way that vaginal douches could fuel anxieties about vaginal hygiene (for the record,vaginas are self-cleaning), the marketing of “lower body” sprays could create a sense that washing alone is not enough. And, heaven forbid teenagers decide that these products can be used in the place of showers, as some kind of “goblin mode” hack.“I would say there is some general genital anxiety in the air,” DeFino says, pointing to abortion bans in the US, the British supreme court’s recent ruling that being a “woman” means “biologically female”, as well as “the rise of conservative pronatalist rhetoric, a renewed focus on rigid gender roles and legislation that interferes in citizens’ sex lives”.“All these policies reduce people to parts with prescribed uses,” she says. “The anxiety produced by this reduction gets projected on to products. When the state is policing your body, ‘genital skincare’ suggests policing it yourself can restore some sense of control.”Can I pop this? 18 common skincare questions, answered by dermatologistsRead more“Control” certainly seems to be the key attraction of whole-body and long-lasting deodorants. A number of the influencers advertising Sure’s whole body products online refer to “Fobo” – “fear of body odour”. I haven’t seen that acronym used by anyone who is not selling Sure products, except to mean“fear of better options”, so it may well have been cooked up by the brand, rather than something people are genuinely saying. But that doesn’t mean the sentiment behind it isn’t true: research conducted by fabric-softener brand Lenor in 2019 found that, of the 2,000 British adults polled,30% had held themselves back sociallybecause of a fear that they smelled bad.Such anxieties are only heightened by social media, creating pressure to have the kind of perfectly cultivated, curated life that is advertised to us at every turn. The algorithms want us to worry about how we smell, just as they want us to worry about how we look – because then we will buy more products.“Social media and beauty marketing have played a big role in normalising the idea that any body area that sweats could be treated,” Spear says. Nobody wants to smell bad – although perhaps anyone who has felt sucked in by whole-body deodorant’s marketing might appreciate the reminder that a disgust of body odourhas been linked to an increased likelihood to hold rightwing views– but it is perfectly possible to stay fresh without whole-body products. As Spear stresses: “Most people manage fine with traditional underarm deodorants and basic hygiene practices.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The UK is considering deploying Typhoon jets as part of an enhanced air policing mission to protect the alliance’s eastern flank.There had been at least 19 violations of Polish airspace overnight, said Tusk, and some of them had enteredPolandfrom Belarusian territory. Four Polish airports, including the two that serve Warsaw, were closed to traffic during the incursion. The prime minister of the Netherlands, Dick Schoof, said F-35 jets from his country took part in the mission to intercept the drones. At least three drones were shot down.Tusk, who convened an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, said: “We are dealing with a large-scale provocation … We are ready to repel such provocations. The situation is serious and no one doubts that we must prepare for various scenarios.”Russian drones in Polish airspaceOn social media, Donald Trump posted: “What’s with Russia violating Poland’s airspace with drones? Here we go!”The White House said Trump would speak to Poland’s newly elected nationalist president, Karol Nawrocki, while the US ambassador to Nato, Matthew Whitaker, reiterated backing for Warsaw amid concerns inEuropeover how the Trump administration might respond to a Russian attack on Nato. “We stand by our Nato allies in the face of these airspace violations and will defend every inch of Nato territory,” wrote Whitaker in a post on X.The British defence secretary, John Healey, said he had asked the UK armed forces to look at “options to bolster Nato’s air defence over Poland”. He was speaking after an E5 meeting of ministers from France, Germany, the UK, Italy and Poland, which his Polish counterpart had left early to return home due to the drone incursion.Healey said: “Today, as five nations, we say to President Putin: your aggression only serves to strengthen the unity between our Nato nations; your aggression only serves to strengthen our determination to stand with Ukraine.”Russia launches almost nightly attacks on Ukraine using large, kamikaze drones based on an Iranian design and known informally as “Shaheds”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Wednesday morning that 415 drones and 40 missiles had been used in the overnight attack, most targeting western parts of the country. One person was killed in Zhytomyr region.Zelenskyy urged Nato countries to launch a strong response to the incursion into Poland. “Moscow is always testing the limits of the possible, and if it does not meet a strong reaction, moves to a new level of escalation,” Zelenskyy wrote in a post on social media. “Today was another escalatory step … Not one ‘Shahed’, which could have been called an accident, but at least eight attack drones which targeted Poland.”Russia’s defence ministry released a statement saying Moscow had “no intentions to engage any targets on the territory of Poland”, without confirming or denying that its drones had entered Polish airspace. “We are ready to hold consultations on this subject with the Polish defence ministry,” it added.Russia’s chargé d’affaires in Poland, Andrei Ordash, called the accusations against Moscow groundless, saying “no evidence has been presented proving these drones are of Russian origin”.Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, said Warsaw had “no doubt” that it was dealing with a deliberate attack. “When one or two drones does it, it is possible that it was a technical malfunction, but … in this case there were 19 breaches, and it simply defies imagination that that could be accidental,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One of the drones damaged a building on the ground in eastern Poland but there were no reports of casualties.Tusk insisted there was “no reason to panic”, but said Poland had invoked Nato’s article 4, requesting formal consultations with the alliance. Article 4 has been invoked only seven times since Nato was created in 1949, with the last time in 2022 in the immediate aftermath of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Andriy Sybiha, Ukraine’s foreign minister, called on neighbouring countries to shoot down Russian missiles and drones over Ukrainian airspace, especially in the western regions of the country close to the border with Nato nations. “Ukraine has suggested such a step for a long time. It needs to be taken for the sake of collective security,” he said.Up to now Ukraine’s neighbours have declined to do so, fearing the escalatory potential of directly engaging with Russian missiles and drones.Russia and Belarus will hold a big military drill on Friday known as Zapad, which has raised security concerns in the region and led to Poland closing all its land borders with Belarus.Trump came into office promising a swift end to the war, but has proved unable to persuade Putin to agree a ceasefire. A bilateral summit in Alaska last month yielded few results and Kyiv hopes Trump will put pressure on Moscow after deadlines set by the White House for Russia were ignored. Earlier this week, an Iskander cruise missile hit the cabinet of ministers, a key government building in Kyiv.Wednesday’s incursion into Poland was the first reported occasion when Nato defence forces had directly engaged Russian drones. Poland has been on alert for craft entering its airspace since a stray Ukrainian missile struck a southern Polish village in 2022, killing two people.During the drone attack, the Polish authorities closed several airports, including Chopin airport in Warsaw, the country’s largest, and the key logistics and arms transfer hub in the south-eastern city of Rzeszów. Early morning departures were delayed for several hours and a number of arriving flights were diverted to other Polish airports. An Air China plane from Beijing due to land at Chopin was sent to Copenhagen.Explore more on these topicsPolandNatoRussiaUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A source close to Powell said the briefings were “frankly sexist” and were “wrong and stupid”.Those who attended a hustings hosted by the “red wall” group of MPs said Powell had won over a significant number in the room, many of whom had been expecting to back Phillipson. The soft-left Tribune group also voted to back Powell.“She is definitely becoming the magnet for those of us who want a change,” one backer said.Phillipson is the runaway favourite with MPs, according to the nominations and has been making the case to MPs about her experience as a north-east England MP on the frontline of the red wall and the battle against Reform UK.“We have a broader cross-section of the PLP, MPs from every wing, and considerably more new MPs,” one source close to Phillipson said.Allies of Phillipson said she had been dismayed that some rival camps were resorting to deeply personalised briefings in the media, including that she was “robotic”.Most frontbenchers are expected to give Phillipson their backing, though one minister complained of mixed messaging from No 10 over whether they were officially expected to do so. A source close to Ed Miliband said it was “nonsense” that he was encouraging MPs to back Powell, his former chief of staff.Powell, who as a recently ousted cabinet minister is likely to pick up the votes of those disgruntled with the leadership, is known in the party as a formidable organiser.She is leading the race for votes among centrist and soft-left MPs who have been disillusioned with Starmer, ahead of Thornberry, who had launched her deputy leadership campaign with explicit criticism of Starmer’s handling of the economy, welfare and the Gaza war, but who failed to pick up many endorsements.MPs are thought to be wary of nominating another London MP. Thornberry is Starmer’s constituency neighbour in Islington.McGovern dropped out of the race before Wednesday’s nominations were tallied, saying it was clear momentum had shifted. Earlier she had said it was vital Labour took the argument to the far right to champion an inclusive and progressive Britain, saying: “The progressive cause is at risk of being lost unless we can tell that story.”Her candidacy had caused some confusion among moderate MPs who had been unsure whether to back her or Phillipson. Labour MPs privately voiced despair on Tuesday over the chaotic nature of the race, with hustings cancelled because of tube strikes and issues with room bookings. The main hustings for MPs on Wednesday night was switched to a virtual meeting.Ribeiro-Addy, on the left of the party, told the Guardian that the deputy leadership race was being suffocated by anti-democratic rules that prevented a wider debate. She said it would ultimately drive more Labour members away by preventing a proper contest.“We are losing the people that win us elections, that crowd the streets: the activists. They are completely disenfranchised. And what I’m trying to do by standing is showing them that there’s still a place in this party for them,” she said.“Some people think that us having this conversation is distracting from government and that we shouldn’t be debating amongst ourselves, and it looks like disunity. And I actually think if it’s done in the right way, it makes us look more mature.”Many Labour MPs privately told the Guardian they were very unwilling to nominate anyone from the left in order to broaden the debate, given their experience with Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, which was unpopular with many MPs.“We’ve tried broadening the debate, now I want to try narrowing it,” one said.Explore more on these topicsLabour party deputy leadershipLabourBridget PhillipsonLucy PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

The fourth-largest took place in South Korea, where the former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, repeatedly targeted critical media and his governmentused defamation lawsuitsto silence journalists before being ousted earlier this year.The report described greatly differing contexts for problems facing the media. InNew Zealand, it said, a crisis has been marked by the shrinking of the media landscape, leaving four out of five journalists working for one of only five employers. In Palestine, it said, nearly 200 journalists have been killed since October 2023, and Israel has imposed a blockade on international press entering the Gaza Strip independently.“Between 2024 and 2025, Al Jazeera was targeted by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which have suspended the media outlet’s operations over alleged national security concerns and tensions over its coverage of certain events,” the report notes.Chile recorded the largest improvement in freedom of expression since the International IDEA’s last report in 2021, owing in part to landmark draft legislation aimed at enhancing the safety of journalists, as well as their families.Brothers, cousins, sons: the human stories behind four of the war’s fallen journalistsRead moreThe thinktank highlighted some positive developments:Africarecorded a large share of the global advances in democracy, accounting for 24% of the countries making progress – most notably Botswana and South Africa. Parliamentary elections in Jordan in 2024 were praised for increased fairness and Poland saw improvements too.But the US, though a country long regarded as a leading advocate for democracy worldwide, has significantly reduced both its diplomatic engagement and its financial support for international democracy assistance this year, the report’s authors wrote.“These developments have contributed to a weakening of international democratisation efforts. In less than six months, US domestic political institutions have also lost much of their symbolic sheen, increasingly serving as a reference point for executive overreach and offering more encouragement to populist strongman leaders than to pro-democracy hopefuls,” they said.In 2021, International IDEAadded the USto its list of “backsliding” democracies for the first time, pointing to a “visible deterioration” that it said began in 2019.One measure that may encourage and reinforce democracy would be wider offering of votes for people living abroad, the thinktank argues.“Improving rights of voters living abroad can also reap democratic dividends in both home and host countries,” said Casas-Zamora.Explore more on these topicsPress freedomAfricaChileNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesSouth KoreaNew ZealandnewsShareReuse this content"

He denied there was any famine and blamed the high civilian death toll onHamasplacing missiles in living rooms.He offered no apology for theattack on Hamas’s leadership in Dohaon Tuesday, accusing Qatar of being allies of Hamas rather than mediators.Downing Street said Starmer “condemned Israel’s action in Doha yesterday as completely unacceptable. He said the strikes were a flagrant violation of a key partner’s sovereignty and do nothing to secure the peace we all desperately want to see”.Turning to Gaza, he reiterated his huge concern and implored Israel to change course. They must stop thehuman-made faminefrom worsening further by letting aid in and halting their offensive operations.”No 10 defended the decision for Starmer and the foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, to meet Herzog, and said one goal was to persuade him that Israel needed to do more to evacuate injured children and potential students from Gaza to the UK.View image in fullscreenProtesters gathered outside Chatham House during Isaac Herzog’s visit.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianIn the Commons, the meeting was widely condemned by Labour MPs angry the government is not taking a tougher line with Israel, which some described as a “rogue state”.Herzog’s trip has been billed as a private visit to support the Jewish community in the UK.He said of his encounter with Starmer: “It was a meeting between allies, but it was a tough meeting.”He added: “Things were said that were tough and strong, and clearly we can argue, because when allies meet they can argue. We are both democracies, we both understand the threat from the jihadists.”Herzog condemned the British intention to recognise a Palestinian state, saying: “We believe that a unilateral resolution regarding a Palestinian state will be adverse and negatively affect any future process, because it will be dangerous.“It won’t help one Palestinian, one hostage, and can be adversely interpreted by Hamas.”He also said he rejected “out of hand” comments by Wes Streeting that Israel has to answer allegations of war crimes and genocide.“Even a recent UK report said that Israel is not carrying out, God forbid, any genocide, and we reject it out of hand,” he said. “It’s very easy to blame Israel without understanding the facts or without seeing it for themselves.”Herzog did admit that the food distribution system set up by the Israeli government and the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had not worked, adding Israel was in the middle of a major overhaul of food distribution.He also denied it was an Israeli plan to expel Palestinians from Gaza, urging Europeans not to take remarks made by cabinet members Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich as if they were Israeli policy.“Israel is a democracy with as far-reaching free speech as imaginable, but that does not reflect in any way the Israeli policy,” he said. “This is absolutely not the Israeli position or intention. Israel has made it clear it does not want to expel anyone.”Herzog tried to downplay plans to annex most of the West Bank, saying they were not going to be implemented tomorrow.Rejecting a two-state solution, he said both sides were too traumatised to consider such a step, and accused Hamas of trying to drive the region and the world crazy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The crowd ​chant​ed “lock him up”​ throughout Herzog’s speech.Rachel, a 20-year-old law student who held a “Herzog to the Hague” sign, called for ​his arrest and said it was “disgusting” that he had been granted a meeting with Starmer.“However​, it’s not surprising. We know that this government, time and time again, has accepted and welcomed war criminals,” she said​.“The government knows that so much of the British public do not stand for this. We do not stand for the actions of Herzog and they knew they had to do this in secret, because we would have been there to stop it.”Jacqueline Namon, who travelled from Reading to London for the protest, said she felt the government had rolled out the red carpet for Herzog.“Whatever I’m doing during the day, I’m thinking about Gaza. It’s just in my head the whole time. It’s stressful but I can’t believe it’s just getting worse and worse. I can’t understand how the powers that be are behaving the way they are behaving.”In an earlier briefing to the media, Herzog insisted that the Qatar strike was designed to bring about an end to the war. “We targeted those who refused to accept the deal – primarily Khalil al-Hayya, who was the head of Hamas,” he said.“He kept on being the objector. He refused adamantly to get to a deal. He kept on saying ‘no’, or ‘yes, but’ – and the ‘but’ was impossible to overcome.“His conditions could never be met. He was one of the instigators and perpetrators of 7 October, and I guess the Americans can confirm it.”Al-Hayya was initially reported to have been killed in the strike, but Israeli officials have since suggested that this may not be the case. However, his son, Humam, and Jihad Labad, the director of his office, have been confirmed as being among the six people killed.In a statement released after the meeting, No 10 said: “The leaders agreed that the hostages who were cruelly ripped by Hamas from their families nearly two years ago must be released.“The prime minister also shared his condolences for the horrifyingterror attack in Jerusalemon Monday, making clear that the UK stands against the abhorrent terrorism Israel has endured since 7 October.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerIsraelIsrael-Gaza warHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

It just could not happen in Britain. You have to be incredibly resilient, fight for early release and be philosophical about it as much as you can.”It continued: “Everything can be turned into an opportunity and that you will come through it and be stronger for it.”In an email on the eve of Epstein being sentenced, Mandelson wrote to him: “You have to be incredibly resilient, fight for early release and be philosophical about it as much as you can.“The whole thing has been years of torture and now you have to show the world how big a person you are, and how strong.”The emails, also reported by Bloomberg, show Mandelson helped Epstein with strategy. It showed Epstein pushing Mandelson to ask “your guy” to have a discussion with a “mr big” for him.Another email from Mandelson to Epstein in February 2008 said: “Reminder. You are fighting back so you need strategy, strategy, strategy. Remember the Art of War.”The friendship between the two men has come back into the spotlight after Democratic members of the US House oversight committee released Epstein’s 50th “birthday book”, in which Mandelson called him “my best pal”in a handwritten note.The Telegraph reported that when Mandelson was business secretary in 2010, and after the financier’s release from jail, he allowed Epstein to help broker a deal for JP Morgan to buy part of a commodities firm from the UK government-owned RBS bank.No 10 stood firmly behind Mandelson on Wednesday, saying he had been fully security-checked before taking up the role and was the right person for the job.One person familiar with Mandelson’s process said he had been subject to the highest level of checking, called developed vetting, which is likely to have touched on his association with Epstein given that it was publicly known at the time of his appointment.However, the new emails are likely to raise further questions about whether the prime minister knew the full extent of Mandelson’s support for Epstein when he appointed him US ambassador earlier this year.The Conservatives havecalled for Mandelson to be sackedand the Lib Dems demanded an investigation by the civil service commissioner into whether the diplomatic service code has been broken.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, said they were “sickening revelations” and that Mandelson’s position was untenable.1:31Kemi Badenoch presses Starmer on Peter Mandelson's suitability as US ambassador – video“Why did Starmer defend him today? How was ‘full due process followed’? This is a weak prime minister, leading a government mired in scandal. The public deserves better.Peter Mandelsonneeds to be fired now,” she said.A number of Labour MPs are privately furious about Keir Starmer’s judgment in appointing Mandelson to the job, knowing that he kept up his association with Epstein after the businessman had served a jail term, which ended in 2009, for soliciting girls under 14.One MP said No 10 had appeared to view the scandal around Epstein and Mandelson as “a silly internet conspiracy” rather than taking it seriously, while another said the “boys’ club” in Downing Street had rallied round him without considering the consequences.Two Labour MPs, Bell Ribeiro-Addy and Kim Johnson, called for Mandelson to quit, while the US lawyer Gloria Allred, who has represented 27 of Epstein’s victims, said the US ambassador should answer questions in front of a congressional hearing.Mandelson has previously claimed not to have had a business relationship with Epstein and told the FT to “fuck off” when it questioned him about the financier.However, in an interview earlier this week with the Sun, he said he had been deceived by Epstein’s “lies” and described the scandal as “like an albatross around my neck”. Epstein killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting further charges of trafficking young girls.At prime minister’s questions, Starmer was pressed on whether he had known about what the Telegraph reported.Epstein 50th birthday book: who is in it and what did they say?Read moreHe said that “full due process was gone through when the appointment was made”, although Mandelson claimed on Tuesday night that he had not discussed the matter with the prime minister.Starmer said the victims of Epstein were “at the forefront of our minds” and described Epstein as a “despicable criminal who committed the most heinous crimes and destroyed the lives of so many women and girls”.“The ambassador has repeatedly expressed his deep regret for his association with him. He’s right to do so. I have confidence in him and he’s playing an important role in the UK-US relationship,” the prime minister said.Badenoch called for all of Mandelson’s correspondence with Epstein to be released and pressed for more details on how much Starmer knew about the relationship.“The Daily Telegraph reports today that while Lord Mandelson was business secretary, he brokered a deal with Jeffrey Epstein while he was business secretary, and that this occurred after Epstein had been convicted of child sex offences. Given this new information, does the prime minister really think it is tenable for our ambassador to remain in post?” she said.Starmer said the relationship between the US and the UK “is one of our foremost relationships, and I have confidence in the ambassador in the role that he is doing”.Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, also increased pressure on Starmer by asking whether it was appropriate for Mandelson to remain in his position as the key liaison between the UK and US when the Trump administration may possess further embarrassing material about his dealings with Epstein.Trump, the US president, is also under scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein, having also allegedly contributed to his 50th birthday book – although he has denied the authenticity of the letter and dismissed it as a fake.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

But the proportion using forceps or ventouse cups has fallen over the same period, from 12.3% to 11.1%.Dr Shuby Puthussery, an associate professor in maternal and child health at the University of Bedfordshire, said: “It’s worrying that over 50% of births involved medical intervention. But it’s linked to a broader demographic trend.“We see a rather worrying trend of births to [older] women increasing year by year, along with significant increases in factors such as obesity, maternal diabetes and pre-existing medical conditions, leading to more complex medically assisted births, especially among women from ethnic minority groups and those living in poverty.”Better access to antenatal care, especially scans, would help detect problems earlier and reduce the risk of mothers needing medical assistance while in labour, she said.Prof Asma Khalil, the vice-president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), disagreed that a caesarean increases the risk faced by women.“Caesarean births are common and the steady increase isn’t necessarily a cause for concern as long as future services are well-prepared to adapt and ensure they have the right staffing, training and facilities to manage increasingly complex births.“The caesarean birthrate in England has steadily increased over the past decade. One factor in this is the increasing proportion of pregnancies that are complex.“We are seeing national rising rates of obesity and people choosing to have children at a later stage in their life, both of which can increase the chance of complications.”The report said: “There are risks and benefits to both vaginal and caesarean modes of birth, and the reasons for choosing a caesarean birth, planned or unplanned, can include physical or psychological benefits.“While unnecessary interventions may lead to adverse outcomes, it is important to note that there is no ‘ideal’ rate for births by caesarean.”In 2023, a total of 23.1% of births were emergency caesareans and 16.4% were planned.The NMPA is a joint piece of work by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Royal College of Midwives, Royal College of Paediatrics and ChildHealthand researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.It confirmed that fertility rates had declined sharply over recent years. The number of births in England and Wales has been falling steadily since 2012, and 2023 saw the lowest number since 1977. The fertility rate in England and Wales is now 1.44 children per woman.Scotland recorded its lowest-ever total fertility in 2023. The rate there has fallen to just 1.3 babies per woman.NHS England was asked for comment.Explore more on these topicsWomen's healthNHSWomenHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

However, Ellison’s lead was short-lived as the stock closed at $328, a rise of 36% valuing Ellison’s shareholding at $378bn and putting Musk back ahead.The pair sit comfortably ahead of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos.Ellison, 81, also has other sources of wealth, including a stake in electric carmaker Tesla, where Musk is chief executive, a sailing team, the Indian Wells Open tennis tournament, and an island in Hawaii, according to Bloomberg.Musk, an antagonist to various figures in the worlds of business and politics, has a close relationship with Ellison – who is often described as a mentor to the South Africa-born tech entrepreneur.Ellison sat on the board of Tesla between 2018 and 2022 and put $1bn intoMusk’s purchase of Twitter–since rebranded as X. According to Walter Isaacson’s biography of Musk, when the Tesla CEO asked Ellison to invest in Twitter, Ellison said he would put in a billion dollars or “whatever you recommend”. Musk is a frequent visitor to Ellison’s Hawaiian island, Lanai, according to the book.Ellison is also a supporter of Donald Trump and has regularly appeared alongside the US president at the White House, includingthe launch of the Stargate projectto invest $500bn in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US. Musk, a prominent backer of Trump’s 2024 election campaign, also had a strong relationship with Trump before itimploded earlier this year.Oracle accounts for the majority of Ellison’s wealth and its value has been boosted by demand from AI companies for its cloud services, which provide computing capacity for firms such as ChatGPT developer OpenAI, who need vast datacentres to power their technology.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pushed back with teargas by riot police, Jess, who asked for her real name not to be published, said she was scared by police tactics but felt it was crucial to be on the streets.“Public services are failing, the quality of care in hospitals is getting worse,” she said. “Years of cuts to the health sector means doctors suffer, patients suffer. The health service is very visibly the target of austerity cuts that are having an impact on people’s wellbeing.

In Montreuil, banners read “Macron give the money back” and featured jokes about barricades being “Bayroucades”.After Macron called an inconclusive snap election last year,parliament remains dividedbetween the left, the far right and the centre, with no absolute majority. Many voters on the left and far right felt their calls for change had been ignored and that by appointing Lecornu, Macron was sticking firmly to his pro-business economic policy.Eighty-thousand police and gendarmes were mobilised across France on Wednesday as protesters attempted to block roads, built barricades or gathered in town centres. By mid-afternoon there had been more than 300 arrests, with more than 180 in Paris. At Paris’s Gare du Nord, riot police stopped hundreds of protesters from entering the building and fired teargas in nearby streets. In Lyon, protesters blocked a road running through the city and set bins on fire. In the western city of Nantes and in the southern city of Marseille police used teargas to disperse protesters. South of Limoges, tractors blocked a key road. Across France about 150 high schools were barricaded.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The high school entrance was blocked by dozens of bins and police had used teargas on crowds in the street outside.“It’s my first barricade,” said Claire, a first-year high school student, who did not want her real name to be published. She had woken at 6.30am to gather bins from surrounding streets to blockade the entrance to the school. All lessons had been cancelled. “I’m doing this to protest against inequality – there is a growing divide between the very rich and the poor,” she said.

Still friends, the band explain their odd rebirthWed 10 Sep 2025 09.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 10 Sep 2025 09.21 EDTShareLike an outsider art version of Sugababes, or kids singing over Depeche Mode ringtones, there’s something both familiar and odd aboutSummer 2000by X-Cetra. Recorded by four preteens in Y2K California, the album distils sleepovers, crushes and butterfly clips into 11 tracks of bedroom pop and Windows 95 R&B, equal parts carefree and gravely serious.Only 20 CD-R copies were ever made. But a still-unknown person posted one of them online in 2001, and by 2020 the girls – now women – were astonished to find it being discussed on muso forum Rate Your Music. “Pure creative expression of these preteen best friends who love each other and wanted to make art together, and that’s so beautiful,” says one user there; “Definitely on the poppier side of ‘accidentally avant garde music made by children’,” says another.US label Numero approached them about properly releasing the album, which came out on vinyl – with matching nail polish – in January and has further grown X-Cetra’s cult following. (The 1975 frontman Matty Healy was spotted picking up a copy in an LA record shop.) Now the band are back together and the subject of a forthcoming documentary. “It’s been amazing to reconnect musically and creatively with these girls – we’ve already made two songs,” says member Jessica Hall.X-Cetra were four childhood friends, aged between nine and 11: Hall, Ayden Mayeri, and sisters Mary and Janet Washburn. “There were lots of adventures,” says Mary of “iconic” 90s summers spent in their home town of Santa Rosa. “We were talking to boys and eventually going to the mall and stuff, but we were also still able to access imagination and play.” The inseparable four formed their own dance troupe and made lo-fi movies, which usually involved “a mistaken identity or gang members, and always murder”, according to Hall. “It’s that perfect age where you’re not self-conscious about it, you’re just ferociously making stuff.”View image in fullscreen‘Ferociously making stuff’ … (top) Ayden Mayeri and Jessica Hall and (bottom) Janet and Mary Washburn of X-Cetra.When the girls started writing songs, they approached Mary and Janet’s motherRobin O’Brien, a musician active on the home taping scene in the 1980s. “Our mom is very respectful of children’s personhood and was not condescending,” Mary says of the album’s recording. “She wanted to represent us in a very authentic way.” O’Brien helped the girls fit their lyrics and melodies to pre-recorded tracks by a German friend, musician Achim Treu. The album’s resulting disjointed oddness is striking, rather like a sassier version of reality TV star Farrah Abraham’s outsider pop classic My Teenage Dream Ended. Speechless has a lugubrious reggae beat; Promises matches girl-group harmonies with ultra-minimal guitar; Wonderland “is using Alice-in-Wonderland imagery to talk about the discomfort of growing up”, says Hall.Soft sandwiches, street fights and surrealism: Marlene Marder’s memoir of Swiss punks Kleenex/LiliputRead moreMayeri says the Y2K era “is so popular right now with young people, but it’s all very commercial stuff being recreated” – see the remake of I Know What You Did Last Summer, or how pop star Addison Rae channels peak Britney. X-Cetra were drawing from a “whole quilt of stuff we were listening to, ways we were dressing, and things we were doing that you only really know about if you were there,” she says. As well as the Spice Girls, Mariah Carey and Ace of Base, the girls were into Fiona Apple, the Space Jam soundtrack and Pure Moods mail-order CDs. They loved The Craft (“we were doing seances all the time” says Mary) as much as Titanic. “We were distilling what we saw in the culture,” says Mayeri. “It came out in a warped way because we didn’t understand the context. The situations weren’t relatable, but the feelings were.”The band’s lyrics pull from a mix of childhood experience and imagined adulthood. The breezy girlishness of Summer 2000’s title track (“party ’til two, sleep ’til one”) is followed by trip-hop and, on Conversation, themes of domestic violence. “The lyrics can be jarring for people: how do these kids know about these adult topics?” Janet says. “A lot of them are about what we thought could happen in adult relationships. [That age] is such a weird time of mystery and intrigue, with all this unknown stuff ahead of you – it’s exciting but scary.”X-Cetra: Summer Forever – videoJanet says X-Cetra were “ready to become the next Spice Girls”, but after the album was finished, they almost immediately disowned it – a combination of the rapid self-consciousness of turning 13, and their confusion at the “dissonant and haunted” sound of an album that they hoped would resemble the polished pop they heard on the radio. “We wanted to sound like hot teens and good singers,” says Mary. “We sounded like ourselves, which was uncomfortable.” The girls grew up, went to college and left their home town, pursuing careers in tech (Hall), finance (Janet), publishing (Mary) and acting (Mayeri, whose TV and film credits include New Girl and Veep).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

She is co-producing the upcoming documentary about the band, which will feature their home movies from the time, as well as the new music they made after getting together to film reunion footage last year. “We got back together in our home town and it was four days of sleepover energy,” says Mayeri. “We choreographed a dance; we wrote a song with Robin, to see if we could. It was scary as none of us identify as singers, but exciting.” They’ve since done a second session with producer Owen Jackson and songwriter Alexandra Veltri, who has credits with Y2K icons Paris Hilton and Heidi Montag.Becoming X-Cetra again has been a full circle moment for the four friends, now in their 30s, creating without the self-consciousness that can plague teens and twentysomethings. “Once puberty hits you start obsessing about being cool, you get boy-crazy, and all of the creativity goes away,” says Hall. “I completely abandoned a very important part of myself, something that really lit me up as a kid. And now it’s shoving itself back into my life.” Mayeri agrees: “In your 20s you’re trying on different personalities, then in your 30s, you’re like, I just want to be who I really am. It’s been a homecoming for us to all reconnect to that and to each other.”The documentary is almost finished, and the band are keen to continue making music. “We’re still figuring out our collective identity as musicians now,” says Mary. A quarter of a century since Summer 2000, the four friends’ connection and creativity are still palpable – as the Spice Girls said, friendship never ends. “We’re all in,” says Janet. “I want to be making an album when we’re 70.”Summer 2000 is out now on Numero GroupExplore more on these topicsPop and rockR&BfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But at the film’s premiere in London earlier this month, that movie’s star, Hugh Bonneville, spoke out aboutGaza. “Before I talk about the fluff and loveliness of our wonderful film, what’s about to happen in Gaza City is absolutely indefensible,” he announced to a visibly shocked showbiz reporter. “The international community must do more to bring it to an end.”Bonneville’s words may have been surprising for some, but they’re actually part of a larger pattern of actors, musicians, artists and cultural figures who feel increasingly moved to speak out. This week hundreds of actors – including Olivia Colman, Aimee Lou Wood and Mark Ruffalo –signed a pledge promising not to work with Israeli film institutionsthey say are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people”. From the Eurovision winner JJ using his victory to criticise Israel to footballer Mohamed Salah lambasting UEFA for announcing the death of Suleiman Obeid, the “Palestinian Pele”, without saying that he was killed in an Israeli attack, there is a sense that if people don’t use their platforms to speak out now, they may bitterly regret it later.There’s been a shift – artists see their platforms matter and want to amplify the call for justice“So many people have been afraid of saying the wrong thing, but are now realising that silence is also a statement,” says the musician PinkPantheress, who thinks we are at a tipping point in terms of discussingGaza. “There’s been this shift where artists see that their platforms actually matter – and that it is their responsibility to amplify the call for justice. Neutrality shouldn’t be an option.”Next week, PinkPantheress will be performing in a manifestation of this tipping point, when a concert called Together for Palestine is held at the 12,500-capacity Wembley Arena, with all profits going to Palestinian humanitarian groups in Gaza through British charityChoose Love. It will be one of the largest-scale benefit concerts for Palestine, since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023. These were followed by a campaign ofbombardmentandstarvation by Israelthat has been labelled a genocide by groups including theUNand Amnesty International.Along with names who have spoken out about Palestine for years, such as Massive Attack and Damon Albarn, there is a broad range of cultural figures on the bill including Benedict Cumberbatch, Louis Theroux, Bastille, Paloma Faith, Riz Ahmed, Amelia Dimoldenberg, Hot Chip, Guy Pearce, Portishead, Celeste and Jamie xx. Palestinian artists and musicians, such as Faraj Suleiman, Malak Mattar and Nai Barghouti, are also represented.View image in fullscreenSigned a boycott pledge … Olivia Colman.Photograph: Cat Morley/AvalonThe concert, which sold out in a few hours, has taken 18 months to organise. Venues were initially highly reluctant to be involved, while some musicians showed hesitation about signing up – the fact it is happening at all points not just to the increasingly urgent situation in Gaza, but the way fears about speaking out are starting to dissipate.“You don’t want to be the only person doing this,” saysBrian Eno, who is organising the concert with film producer Tracey Seaward, who was behind Dirty Pretty Things and The Queen, actor Khalid Abdalla, who starred in United 93 and The Kite Runner, and founder of the London Palestine Film Festival Khaled Ziada. “When we first started out,” says Eno, “it was hard to get anyone interested. But I think everyone’s realised that what’s happening in Gaza is completely obscene. Whatever conflicted feelings they might have had about the war beforehand have suddenly disappeared. It’s immoral and repulsive. I think on that point, everybody can at least agree.”Eno is keen to stress that Together for Palestine is not a political rally. Rather, it is billed as a day of hope, community and remembrance. “A lot of the people involved in making this show are Jewish, along with a lot of Palestinians as well,” says Eno. “We want it to be seen as an occasion in which people work together, regardless of their particular faith or ethnic affiliation.”One of those Palestinians is the artist Malak Mattar, who has been working with renowned stage designer Es Devlin to curate a selection of Palestinian artworks for the show. Some of these will be by artists who have died during the conflict, such as Heba Zaqout, who was killed by an Israeli airstrike in October 2023, and Duniyana Al-Amour, who waskilled in her bedroom at the age of 22. The latter attack by Israel took place in August 2022, a reminder that such strikes were taking place long before the Hamas atrocities happened.View image in fullscreen‘When the call came, it was impossible to say no’ … PinkPantheress.Photograph: Scott A Garfitt/Invision/APAs someone who grew up in Gaza and still has family members there, it can be frustrating, says Mattar, to witness the silence of many fellow artists and institutions in the UK. “As an artist myself,” she says, “I know what it means to have things cancelled because you’ve spoken out. I have been asked not to make speeches at my exhibitions. But I think right now is a powerful moment of history, where people are coming together to speak out. It’s going to be a great sense of solidarity that we feel on the night of 17 September – and also very moving when we remember the people that we lost during the genocide.”When the concert was first announced, Eno admitted that one of his biggest regrets, over his illustrious five-decade career in the music industry, was that “so many of us have remained silent about Palestine. Often that silence has come from fear – real fear – that speaking out could provoke a backlash, close doors or end a career.”Yet this fear is now being discussed much more openly. Kneecap were subject to a police investigation and faced calls to have their US work visas revoked after accusing Israel of genocide onstage at the Coachella festival in April. This hasn’t prevented the likes of PinkPantheress from getting involved in the concert: “My team and I talk about the genocide in Palestine often, and what we can do to help as individuals, as a collective, but also what I can do as an artist. Putting your ego aside is important. You have to be willing to learn and get things wrong every now and again. I’m constantly listening and engaging in conversations with my team and friends. When the call came to appear at Together for Palestine, it was impossible to say no.”View image in fullscreenOn the bill … Jamie xx.Photograph: Steve Jennings/Getty ImagesBeing open to learning about the reality of the situation seems crucial for the shift that is now happening. Eno happily admits that his own views on Gaza changed after visiting the West Bank six years ago. There he saw firsthand what he calls “the relentless humiliation … which is the nastiest weapon in a way … continually demeaning, continually shilly-shallying, pretending there’s a peace process when there’s no intention whatsoever to achieve peace on any kind of terms that the Palestinians could possibly accept.”When he tried to explain this to people, Eno says, he was always being forced to go through the entire history of the conflict. People were either bamboozled by the conflicting accounts, or looking for an easy way to avoid getting involved. “Israel has always, in my opinion, depended on calling on the complexity of the situation,” says Eno. “To sort of say, ‘Well, of course you don’t really understand it, it’s far more complex than you can imagine.’ But people are no longer asking me to do this, because everyone knows we shouldn’t be in the place we are now.”PinkPantheress says that having so many fellow artists on the bill supporting the message has made it easier to speak out – and hopefully will make it easier for others to join them in future. “One voice can get ignored,” she says, “but when it’s a chorus it’s way harder. Seeing artists from totally different backgrounds come together proves this isn’t just a political issue but a human one.”Together for Palestine is atWembley Arena, London, 17 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsMusicBrian EnoFestivalsGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But why? The woman who was called ‘the devil’s advocate’ explains allKim WillsherWed 10 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTShareThis time last year, Béatrice Zavarro, a then unknown lawyer from Marseille, drew herself up to her full 1.45-metre (4ft 8in) height, and addressed the figure in the dock: “It’s you and me against the world.”That man was Dominique Pelicot. Over the next three months and 17 days, the court would learn that for almost a decade he had drugged his wife, Gisèle, and invited more than 50 men into their bedroom to rape her while she was unconscious.Zavarro’s decision to defend a man who would become France’s worst sexual predator brought threats, shouts of “How could you?” from protesters outside the court and a grim nickname: the Devil’s Advocate. She maintained a clear and uncompromising line: she was defending the man, not his crimes.For the 55-year-old criminal lawyer, as for many in the court in Avignon, the unprecedented trial was a life-changing experience – so much so that she has written a book about it. “There is a before and after Pelicot,” she says, sitting in the reception of a boutique hotel in Paris where we meet. “I’ve tried to get back to a normal life but there is a difference.“The trial was long and intense with the cameras, the media attention, but when it was all over I had to pick up my work. One reporter told me, ‘You know, we journalists enter your life very suddenly but we leave it equally suddenly,’ so I had been warned. The cameras were on me for a while, then they weren’t and it was back to normal life and anonymity …”Not quite true, I point out. She laughs.“Well, not so anonymous, because people recognise me. They come up to me in the street and ask if we know each other. I reply, hmmm, not necessarily, but you know …”Today, Dominique Pelicot, 72, is in solitary confinement in prison, where he must serve at least two-thirds of the maximum 20-year sentence imposed last December for raping his wife and soliciting others to do so. He is also under investigation for the rape and murder of an estate agent in Paris in 1991 and an attempted rape in 1999.Zavarro will represent him if the cases come to trial and visits him at least once a month to prepare his defence. She is his only visitor.“Today, I believe I can say I know him better than anyone, including his own family,” she says.View image in fullscreenCourtroom sketch of Dominique Pelicot at the courthouse in Avignon.Photograph: ZZIIGG/ReutersZavarro says Pelicot has accepted his situation with “fatalism” but seems distraught his actions have destroyed the rest of his family. His daughter,Caroline, remains convinced her father also photographed and abused herand no longer speaks to Gisèle Pelicot, 72. “My mother isn’t an icon … not to me,” Caroline said in arecent interview. “We no longer have a father or a mother today.”Zavarro shakes her head. “What a terrible thing to say about her mother. Terrible,” she says.“He [Dominique Pelicot] always said he never touched his daughter or any of his children or grandchildren,” says Zavarro. “There was a moment in the trial when I said: ‘Monsieur Pelicot, we’re going to pretend it’s just the two of us, and we’re going to speak of this.’ I thought at that moment he would be encouraged to say yes, he took those photos, but he said, ‘No, it wasn’t me.’ And I believe him.“We had spoken of this before and he had looked me in the eyes and said, ‘I did not take those photos.’ Some will say I was naive, but I believe him.”She continues: “He could have appealed against the minimum sentence imposed but it would have meant another trial andhe said he wouldn’t put his wife through that. He said she had suffered enough.“The split within his family is terrible for him. He is watching the rupture between mother and daughter from afar and he has taken it very, very badly. He didn’t expect to have any relationship with his children after what happened. During the trial he said he would die alone like a dog, but he would have liked above all for the family to remain united. That there is this split is his greatest grief.”Zavarro met Dominique Pelicot in 2021. At the time, she had no idea the case would grow to such horrific and unforeseen proportions, as police combed through the hundreds of videos Pelicot had recorded of his wife being attacked by multiple men.Dominique Pelicot was being held in Marseille’s Baumettes prison in 2021, after being arrested for filming up a woman’s skirt in a supermarket in September 2020. When police confiscated his phone and searched his home, they found thousands of photos and images of rape on his computers and hard drives. While being detained, Pelicot wrote to Zavarro asking if she would represent him in the mass rape trial. She agreed.“At the beginning, I didn’t know exactly what he had done. I was given the list of alleged charges and saw there were quite a few offences, but I had no details,” she says. “My first impression of him was a grandfather, a sort of Father Christmas figure. He was clearly intelligent and communicated in a crystal clear, simple way. At that first meeting, he told me everything.”View image in fullscreenBéatrice Zavarro talks to the media in the Avignon courthouse on 19 December 2024.Photograph: Lewis Joly/APIn her book, Defending theUndefendable, Zavarro writes that she once saw a brief flash of another side to her client. “Our eyes meet, his eyes narrow, and in that moment I sense the predatory tiger.” Still, she did not hesitate in accepting the case – and not for the publicity. At the time, it was assumed the trial would be heldin camerawith no press or public present.“I accepted because I am a lawyer. I was very clear: I defended the man, not what he did. I did not seek to justify what he did, but to explain. I understand some lawyers might have refused the case, but my position was that I had taken an oath as a lawyer and this position was right,” she says.“If he had decided to plead not guilty, or go for an acquittal, which would have been astonishing given the evidence, I’d have still taken the case, but would have written to him outlining the risks he was running. And I’d have asked if he was joking.”Zavarro says it was equally evident that Gisèle Pelicot was beyond reproach. During the trial, she told me:“Gisèle Pelicot is not my enemy”. Today, her approach is the same. “What could I possibly have blamed Mme Pelicot for?” she asks. “It was a unique case where the order of things was overturned. All the sympathy was with her, which isn’t always the case in a classic rape trial where there is always something the defence finds to blame on the victim. In this case it was impossible.”On the first day of the trial, Zavarro strode across the courtroom to whereGisèle Pelicotwas sitting surrounded by her legal team, Stéphane Babonneau and Antoine Camus. “I shook her hand and introduced myself,” Zavarro writes in her book. “She gave a slight smile without saying anything. With this mark of courtesy I felt true to myself and my desire to show her all the respect she inspired in me. I didn’t see why I should be the only woman in this courtroom, in this judicial district, in this city, in this country, not to pay her a discreet, silent tribute.”Defence lawyers representing the 50 men on trial along with Dominique Pelicot for rape and sexual assault had initially tried to hint that his wife was complicit in the abuse. However, this was dispelled by the shocking videos, in which Gisèle was clearly unconscious and snoring.There were also claims by defence lawyers for the other men in the dock that they been tricked and manipulated by Dominique Pelicot.“My job was to say: no, you weren’t,” says Zavarro. “You knew when you went into that bedroom that you would find an unconscious woman. With the videos, they could not say they did not know what they were doing.”The president of the court, Roger Arata, had sought to have the videos excluded from public view as an affront to public decency. “It was Madame Pelicot who battled to have the videos shown because she wanted them seen by everyone, which was astonishing,” says Zavarro. “She showed amazing courage. It’s thanks to her that we were all there, that the case and the debates took on the importance they did. The first time I saw them during the investigation I was extremely shocked, but imagine the same trial without the videos.”Zavarro is instantly recognisable in her scarlet-framed spectacles and large, colourful jewellery. But that may be a distraction from what is evidently a core of steel. She chose to defend Pelicot solo – Gisèle Pelicot had two lawyers – and whether in or out of black court robes, she appears unflappable, diligent and remarkably self-effacing for someone promoting a book. Her husband, Edouard, who many at the courthouse initially assumed was her security guard, is on hand as he was every day of the trial to provide good humour, moral support and advice.For the Pelicot case, as with others she has defended, she says she applied her fundamental belief that there is humanity in everyone and her job is to find it. She agrees with the psychiatrists and psychologists who analysedPelicot and told the court that he suffers a split personalitycaused by a deeply troubled upbringing, a tyrannical father and being sexually abused while in hospital as a child. He is a classic Jekyll and Hyde: a kind, attentive husband, father, neighbour and friend by day; a monster by night, she says.In her trialsumming up, punctuated with literary references, she concluded: “You are not born a pervert, you become one.”“Gisèle Pelicot thought she was living with this one man, but in fact she did not know the other side of that man. All the accused men in that court had a double life. They were all living a lie at some level,” Zavarro says.Asked if she thinks Pelicot deliberately chose her because a female lawyer would help his case, she turns the question around: “You can ask if Monsieur Pelicot chose me because I am a woman, but are you going to ask Mme Pelicot why she chose two men to defend her?”Today, Gisèle Pelicot is rebuilding her life and has not spoken publicly since the trial. She has been made a member of the Légion d’honneur, the highest and most prestigious national order of merit in France, and is also writing a book, due to be published next year. Her “shame must change sides” has been adopted as a popular slogan and the trial resulted ina proposed changein France’s sexual consent and rape laws. A bill defining rape and sexual assault as “any non-consensual act” was passed by the upper house, the Sénat, in June, but a final draft has yet to be presented to parliament.Of the 17 men who initially lodged appeals after their convictions, 16 have now withdrawn them, and the one remaining case will be heard at the court of appeal in October.Zavarro says Dominique Pelicot has no contact with the rest of the prison population and spends his time reading, writing and watching television. He is writing a book. “There are things in the process,” she says, adding: “Nobody will forget this trial: it changed many things, particularly a certain kind of thinking.“Today I hear of women rape victims who appear in court and insist the hearings be open ‘because Gisèle did it’, and men who have been forced to examine their mentality and behaviour. The Pelicot case set light to everything.”Explore more on these topicsGisèle PelicotRape and sexual assaultFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

If you don’t have space for a lamp and it’s possible to do so, try swapping the bulb in your existing ceiling light for something warmer.Swapping shades can also make a big difference, often for little cost. A cream card lampshade, for instance, will give off a warm glow, helping create a homely atmosphere.

Now as Paramount eyes acquisition of her company, Weiss is poised to become Trump’s ally among media elitesDavid KlionWed 10 Sep 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Wed 10 Sep 2025 14.21 EDTShareLast month, federal regulatorsapprovedthe long-anticipated merger of Skydance Media and Paramount Global, positioning David Ellison – the founder of Skydance and the son of megabillionaire Larry Ellison – as one of the most powerful figures in US media. Paramount Skydance Corporation, as it is now officially known, is one of a small handful of American media conglomerates, with Paramount Pictures, cable networks such as Comedy Central and MTV, and CBS all under its umbrella. CBS, in turn, runs one of the major US news operations, with nightly news viewership in the millions and 60 Minutes still being themost watched news program on network television.The implications of the merger are far-reaching and were already being felt ahead of its final approval. In July, Paramountagreed to payDonald Trump $16m to settle a lawsuit over a 60 Minutes segment the president disapproved of, and a few weeks later, CBScontroversially cancelledThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert, which many observers speculated was at least partly about jettisoning an outspoken critic of Trump in anticipation of the deal.Cancelling Colbert, bribery, an $8bn deal: what’s going on at Paramount?Read moreBut one of the most buzzed-about aspects is Paramount’s possible acquisition of the Free Press, the digital media company founded by Bari Weiss as a Substack newsletter in 2021, and Weiss’s potential new role steering CBS’s editorial slant. In July, the Financial Timesreportedthat Weiss was seeking at least $200m for her website – more than double its valuation a year earlier and more than the site’s admittedly impressive155,000 paid subscribers(roughly a 10th of total subscribers) would seem to justify. That same week, the media newsletter Puckpublished an anonymously sourcedreportthat Weiss would possibly be advising David Rhodes, a former CBS and Fox News executive and the current chair of Sky News, in the event that Rhodes resumes running CBS. And just last week, Puckreportedthat the deal was all but finalized, with the Free Press to be acquired for somewhere in the $100m to $200m range (less than Weiss sought but nothing to sneeze at) and with Weiss tasked with “guiding the editorial direction of the [CBS news] division”.If all this comes to pass, it will cement Weiss as a key figure in shaping the national news environment, just five years after hermuch publicized resignationfrom the New York Times over what she characterized as a censorious and hostile workplace. This came in the wake of the resignation of the editorial page editor, James Bennet, after a staff uproar over the publication of Senator Tom Cotton’s opinion piece calling for military intervention against Black Lives Matter protesters.Weiss, 41, is no stranger to publicity; since 2019, she has been the subject of mostly fawning profiles inVanity Fair,Semafor, Los Angeles Magazine,the Times of London,the New Statesman, theFinancial Times, and her former employers,the Wall Street Journalandthe New York Times. The product of an idyllic and fiercely Zionist upbringing in Pittsburgh’s Jewish community, she first gained notice for her campaign against pro-Palestinian faculty during her undergrad years at Columbia University. A stint at the Bret Stephens-run neoconservative Wall Street Journal editorial page followed, before she and Stephens both departed for the New York Times, where her tenure as an opinion editor and writer was stormy well before her resignation. She and her wife, fellow voluntary Times exile Nellie Bowles, decamped to Los Angeles, where she wasted little time launching new projects: she co-founded the “heterodox” University of Austin and launched a Substack, originally dubbed Common Sense and then rebranded as the Free Press, which quickly acquired venture capital backers, a sizable subscriber base, and an editorial staff numbering in the dozens and including many media industry veterans. Her triumphant return to New York City last year marked her as a power broker in her own right. More than any other figure in her age cohort, Weiss wrote the playbook on canceling anti-Zionists and “woke” progressives, even as she decried “cancel culture” and claimed to champion free speech – and with the Free Press, she has developed a whole newsroom around that mission. The Guardian put detailed claims in this piece to Bari Weiss and the Free Press and did not receive an official response.View image in fullscreenBari Weiss, left, then a sophomore at Columbia University, speaks at a press conference organized by Columbians for Academic Freedom as a crowd listens outside the gates to the New York City campus in March 2005.Photograph: Tina Fineberg/APWhen New York Magazineconvened57 of “the most powerful people in media” to discuss the industry’s future last year, Weiss was on the list. A month later, after Trump’s victory, the Free Pressco-hostedan inauguration party with Elon Musk’s X and Uber, attended by the former British prime minister Liz Truss, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, and Dr Mehmet Oz. For each of her haters, and there are many, Weiss countsJeff Bezos,Jerry Seinfeld(whose daughter ison staffat the Free Press), andSheryl Sandbergamong her fans, and Marc Andreessen, David Sacks, and Howard Schultz among her financial backers. “She doesn’t just speak to the 1%,” the conservative pollster Frank Luntz told the New York Times last year. “She speaks to the one-hundredth of 1%. And they’ll listen.”In just a few years, Weiss has gone from a punchline in media circles to one of the most influential names in the industry, one with a genuine popular following beyond insiders and donors. Her stunning comeback is a tribute to her hustle, her oft-acknowledged personal charisma, and above all her unapologetic support forIsraeland attacks on progressive social justice dogmas, often disparaged as “wokeness” – both of which align her with some of the most powerful people alive even as they alienate her from many of her generational peers in journalism.But while Weiss is widely understood as a provocateur, what is less well understood is how she has used the Free Press to empower rightwing factions within established elite institutions, and how her efforts have been turbocharged by Trump’s return to the White House. If Weiss does join CBS, it will only formalize the role she has already carved outas the Trump administration’s de facto ally in its effort to silence progressive and pro-Palestinian voices. Weiss will be an ideological commissar situated within the highest levels of the media business, wielding her considerable platform to help the White House enforce compliance in spaces that fostered resistance during Trump’s first term: the media, academia and civil society.To get a sense of the kind of opportunities Weiss might have to influence decisions and coverage at CBS, it is worth flashing back a year to the fall of 2024. On 30 September, Ta-Nehisi Coatesappearedon CBS’s morning news show, where he was interviewed by anchor Tony Dokoupil over Coates’s new book, The Message, which includes a scathing firsthand account of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank. Dokoupil questioned Coates aggressively (some would say condescendingly) over what he called a one-sided depiction of Israel, and the interview was litigated on social media for days, pitting supporters of Israel and Palestine against each other on predictable lines.A week later, the Free Press joined the fray with anexclusivefrom inside CBS News, where the Coates interview was at least as divisive as it was to the wider public. On the first anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attacks, someone high up at CBS leaked recordings of an editorial meeting to the Free Press, revealing that, as the site’s editors put it, “the network’s top brass all but apologized for the interview to staff, saying that it did not meet the company’s ‘editorial standards.’” Though the article acknowledged that CBS’s chief legal correspondent, Jan Crawford, defended Dokoupil’s tough questions, it portrayed the meeting overall as an example of the woke conformity endemic to institutions such as CBS.“The sad truth is that Coates is not speaking truth to power,” the Free Press editorialized, in a sweeping indictment both ofCBSand of elite liberalism writ large. “He is echoing the new consensus of the powerful. One can find more sophisticated versions of The Message in the course catalogs of Ivy League universities, the editorial pages of leading newspapers, and in the reports of well-funded NGOs. It is journalists like Tony Dokoupil who are an endangered species in legacy news organizations, which are wilting to the pressures of this new elite consensus.”A month later, Trump won the presidential election. Since then, what the Free Press editors termed “this new elite consensus” has been under siege from the federal government, which has openly sought to purge anything it considers “wokeness” from universities, newspapers and NGOs, and in particular hassought to criminalizepro-Palestinian activism and criticism of Israel. Weiss, who has presented herself as a leading defender of free speech, has in effect leveraged her publication to help the government suppress it.If you work at a liberal institution and you want the Trump-controlled federal government to step in and discipline it, Bari Weiss is there to helpThe Free Press’s involvement in the administration’s war on Columbia University, Weiss’s alma mater (and, full disclosure, mine; I socialized with Weiss as an undergraduate, though we have not spoken in years) has been a case in point. Trump’s joint task force to combat antisemitism chose the Free Press tobreak the newson 7 March that the administration was withholding $400m in federal grants to Columbia over the university’s alleged failure to combat antisemitism in the wake of the 7 October attacks – essentially the opening volley in Trump’s assault on elite higher education. Two weeks later, on 21 March, Columbiaconcededto Trump’s blackmail, agreeing to place its Middle East studies department – which Weiss has beencrusading againstsince she was an undergraduate two decades ago – under academic receivership. Just four days after that, the Free Presspublished a leaked transcriptof a private Zoom call in which the university’s then president, Katrina Armstrong, told about 75 faculty members that she did not intend to comply with all of Trump’s demands, despite her public surrender. Three days later, Armstrong resigned – andaccording to the New York Times, a key reason why was that Trump’s antisemitism task force expressed concern over the transcript leaked to the Free Press.Weiss’s publication, in short, was the preferred vehicle for conveying information from Columbia insiders who wanted to purge all criticism of Israel from the university to Trump administration officials who were using unprecedented financial pressure to help them do exactly that. Just as with CBS a year ago, Weiss and the Free Press were there to help reactionaries at elite institutions advance their internal turf wars – and unlike a year ago, those reactionaries can now count on the full weight of Trump’s authoritarian administration to back them up.The same playbook can also be seen in the Free Press’s efforts to discredit National Public Radio, which from 1971 until this summer served as America’s major publicly supported broadcaster. Last April, the Free Presspublishedanerror-ladenarticle by a disgruntled NPR business editor, Uri Berliner, who accused his employer of pervasive liberal bias and of betraying America’s trust. Berliner was predictablyhiredby the Free Press two months later, and within a year, he was beinginvitedby House Republicans to testify against his former employer. In July of this year, Trump’s allies on Capitol Hill voted to defund NPR, and the Free Press published Berliner’svictory lap. The pattern is clear: if you work at a liberal institution and you want the Trump-controlled federal government to step in and discipline it, Bari Weiss is there to help.These are the real stakes of Weiss potentially joining CBS. If Paramount’s acquisition of the Free Press goes through, Weiss will probably be in a position to recruit a network of snitches and rightwing thought police, both from within existing CBS staff and from her own publication, ensconced throughout one of the four largest US media conglomerates. CBS staffers arereportedly “apoplectic”at the news of her impending role, with some raising concerns about a “hall monitor” approach to coverage and others threatening to resign – resignations Ellison and Weiss might welcome, as it would give them an opportunity to start fresh. Weiss could be responsible for shaping coverage and enforcing her own orthodoxy, especially with regard to Israel and its critics – an issue around which Weiss has consistently provided cover for Benjamin Netanyahu’s genocidal government. This would represent a shift for CBS; Paramount’s outgoing chair, Shari Redstone, is an avowed supporter of Israel who hasreportedlybeen outraged by 60 Minutes’s coverage since the 7 October attacks, and has openly expressed hope that the Trump administration could force CBS to clamp down on “anti-Israel bias”, which Weiss is ideally suited to facilitate.View image in fullscreenBari Weiss hosts Senator Ted Cruz at a Free Press event presented with Uber and X on 18 January in Washington DC.Photograph: Leigh Vogel/Getty Images for Uber, X and The Free PressLast month, the Free Press sparked widespread outrage by publishing anarticleby staffers Olivia Reingold and Tanya Lukyanova, who reported that the starving Palestinian children whose images appeared in multiple mainstream outlets were all suffering from pre-existing conditions such as cystic fibrosis or rickets – a clear attempt to bolster a narrative the publication has beenpushing for monthsthat widely reported famine conditions in Gaza are a hoax. Reingold and Lukyanova’s article drew condemnation from many quarters, including from the president of Refugees International, whopointed outthat it is precisely children with such conditions who are most vulnerable in a famine. But the Free Press brushed off its critics andclaimed creditfor pushing CNN and the Washington Post to caveat their coverage in light of their reporting. “Journalistic outlets love to boast about ‘impact,’ and this story has had more than its share,” wrote the editors. As if to prove their point, Netanyahu himselfposted a videoof Reingold defending her work, with the caption: “Facts matter.” (The Guardian stands by the stories it published that included the image and saysthe photo did not act to deceive.)Weiss has often been underestimated, but the success of the Free Press to date vindicates her seemingly limitless ambitionOne of the critics the Free Press singled out was Ben Rhodes, a former top adviser to Barack Obama, who, the Free Press noted, was once nicknamed “Hamas”, an epithet used by his Obama administration colleague Rahm Emanuel (who sat for afriendly interviewwith Weiss in July) for his willingness to criticize Israel. In an appearance on Pod Save the World – which is part ofCrooked Media, the independent progressive podcasting network run by former Obama staffers – RhodescalledReingold and Lukyanova’s reporting “sociopathic” and “grotesque”. “There’s something wrong with you, deeply, deeply fucked up,” he added. These would be harsh words coming from anyone, but Ben Rhodes is the brother of David Rhodes, who has been floated as CBS’s next executive and who reportedly would be working closely with Weiss. In Ben Rhodes’s 2018 memoir, The World As It Is, he acknowledged political differences with his brother while also saying they have always been close. That he would speak publicly with such undisguised contempt about Weiss’s media company in that context suggests serious alarm at the possible direction of CBS News.Alarm is a justifiable reaction. Weiss has often been underestimated, but the success of the Free Press to date vindicates her seemingly limitless ambition. That is in spite of internal turmoil: in May, the media newsletter Breakerreportedthat the Free Press had seen a number of notable departures amid its rapid expansion and that staff had been skeptical of Weiss’s “chaotic” management style.But in the context of Trump’s federally funded culture war, it is unclear any of that will matter. In order to avoid the president’s disfavor and present themselves as worthy of access, legacy media companies are desperate to tap into the audience and the relationships that Weiss has so effectively courted.Although the Free Press did not respond on the record to the Guardian’s questions, a source within the Free Press defended the range of views the organization publishes and emphasized that it was not a partisan shop.When Trump first ran for office, Weiss positioned herself as a “Never Trumper”, following the lead of her mentor Stephens and other prominent neoconservatives, and in 2017 shedescribedthe first Trump administration as “shambolic”. But this February, as Trump kicked off his second term, WeisstoldFox News’s Howard Kurtz that her stance on Trump had softened. “I’m the first to admit that I was a sufferer of what conservatives at the time would have called TDS, Trump Derangement Syndrome,” Weiss said, claiming she cried at her desk the first time Trump won. Now, she explained, she had come to appreciate Trump for two main reasons: first, she saw the left’s “overzealous, out-of-touch, hysterical reaction to him” as “extraordinarily authoritarian and totalitarian in its impulses”, and second, she approved of some of his actual policies, noting particularly his Israel-aligned moves in the Middle East.The anti-woke warriors used to defend free speech. Now they make McCarthyism look progressive | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThe Free Press claims to be independent and non-partisan, and ahead of the 2024 election it canvassed its own staff anddeterminedthat it was equally divided between supporters of Trump, Kamala Harris and neither. But during Trump’s second term, the site has been noticeably sympathetic to the administration. As the UnPopulist has carefullydocumented, Weiss has made a choice in the Trump restoration era – rather than position the Free Press as a heterodox champion of “classical liberalism”, as it was initially presented during the Biden years, she has aligned herself with the White House’s priorities. Thehiringof Batya Ungar-Sargon, a formerly left-leaning journalistturned fervent Maga pundit, this April was a clear signal of Weiss’s repositioning. This choice has alienated many of her former champions – for instance, Glenn Greenwald, who achieved a publicrapprochementwith Weiss in the early days of the Free Press (both Weiss and Greenwald have thrived and handsomely profited on Substack), has since excoriated her for consistently attacking the free speech rights of Israel critics. But it has also set her up well to ascend to even greater influence.Weiss is not afraid to burn bridges, scandalize critics or be branded a hypocrite in pursuit of power. In that sense, she has something in common with the president who has done so much to enable her rise. But Trump could never operate in the kinds of spaces where Weiss has been able to flourish. With her education, experience and extensively cultivated networks, she is uniquely well-suited to champion the prerogatives of those in academia, media, publishing and similar sectors who feel threatened by progressive social movements. Liberal institutions produced Bari Weiss, and now at least one could be hers to remake.David Klion is a columnist for the Nation, a contributing editor at Jewish Currents, and currently working on a book about the legacy of neoconservatism"

Less than a week ago, a 26-nation“coalition of the willing”led by France and the UK announced an agreement on a “reassurance force”, intended to help guarantee Ukraine’s security after any ceasefire in Russia’s relentless war of aggression. Vladimir Putin has stepped up the nightly bombardment of Ukraine in defiance of Donald Trump’s efforts to broker a peace deal, and rejected any presence of European forces on the ground.The Russian defence ministry said it hadno intention to engageany targets on Polish territory. But the incursion by 19 drones, several of which were shot down, looks like a deliberate test of the west’s political will to step up support for Kyiv at a time when European allies are unsure how far they can rely on US backing, given Trump’s erratic leadership. It may also have been intended to strike fear into European populations, fuelling anti-war sentiment fanned by populist parties.Several European Nato allies were involved in helping the Polish air force intercept the drone intrusion, including an Italian radar plane, Dutch fighter aircraft and German Patriot missiles, according to Nato.This was not the first violation of Nato airspace since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but it was by far the largest. It also targeted a country that has been the main hub for western arms deliveries to Kyiv, as well as a leader in European rearmament. Armed Russian drones have landed (harmlessly) inLatviaandLithuania, and a stray Ukrainian air defence missilekilled two Poles in 2022.Russian aircraft and naval vessels regularly probe western reactions by flying very close to – and occasionally in and out of – the airspace and territorial waters of Baltic, North Sea and Black Sea countries. In a cat-and-mouse game, Nato nations frequently scramble planes to escort Russian aircraft away, or send naval vessels to shadow ships sailing close to key energy pipelines and underwater cables. Similarly,Finland has detainedandSweden boardedChinese boats suspected of having deliberately damaged underwater infrastructure by dragging their anchors along the seabed.However, this was the first time a Nato member has had to shoot down Russian drones over its territory since the war in Ukraine began. “This situation brings us the closest we have been to open conflict since the second world war,” the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk,said in a sombre addressto his parliament.Poland invoked Nato’s article 4, under which an ally can request consultations “whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened”. In astatement after talks in Brussels, Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, said allies expressed solidarity with Poland and denounced Russia’s “reckless behaviour”.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, was quick to blame Putin personally. In a last-minute addition to her“state of the union” addressto the European parliament, she said: “Just today we have seen a reckless and unprecedented violation of Poland’s and Europe’s airspace by more than 10 Russian Shahed drones. Europe stands in full solidarity with Poland. Putin’s message is clear and our response must be clear too.”European leaders will doubtless seize on the Russian incursion to press Trump to commit to providing support for a European-led reassurance force forUkraine. They will also point to the incident as justification for the rearmament drive they have launched to counter the growing Russian threat to European security. Nato allies may well send planes and missile batteries to bolster Poland’s air defences.Behind closed doors, there is likely to be sharper debate about how aggressively Nato should respond to Russian violations and other acts of hybrid warfare such as sabotage and cyber-attacks. Nordic and Baltic members are pressing for a more robust response – for instance, empowering Nato air patrols to shoot down any crewed Russian aircraft that enter their airspace – to demonstrate Nato’s solidarity and resolve to go to war, if any of its nations is attacked. They also want European and US allies to supply Ukraine with longer-range missiles and free its hand to strike deep inside Russian territory. Ukraine itself, meanwhile, is urging Nato countries to shoot down Russian missiles in its airspace from their own soil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the dead of night, or at family dinnertime? Will they come with masks and shields, or will they be kindly and sheepishly apologetic? Will they accept a cup of tea and a biscuit if offered? Will there be bags already packed by the door, protocols prepped and drilled, a list of numbers to call? Will you go quietly and with dignity, or in a mess of curse words and screaming limbs?Perhaps right now this all feels a little fantastical and far-fetched. Perhaps it feels hard to imagine the great wave of remigration lapping up on the pristine middle-class doorsteps of Stroud or Stoke Newington. We can still have a chuckle about it. Maybe there’ll be a nice fat relocation cheque. A free one-way holiday on the British government. Always wanted to visit China at this time of year, and so on.But of course if the recent history of British politics has taught us anything, it is that nightmarish visions do not stay nightmarish visions for long. There is a heft and momentum behind them, a spirited and concerted effort to make the nightmare flesh. And so in our darkest daydreams, many of the non-white citizens of this country occasionally entertain an idle thought exercise: who wants to get rid of us? Is it you, grumbling old lady on the bus? Is it you, the smartly dressed businessman tutting quietly as two beaming mixed-race children whiz by on mini-scooters? Was that an innocent jostle in the pub queue, or the unmistakable microaggression of a seething racist who wants me gone for good?Two decades after the Conservative party asked “Are you thinking what we’re thinking?”, it turns out that quite a lot of people were. Through the long years of Windrush scandals and asylum panic, Brexit and beyond, from the British National party in local government to white nationalists proudly parading through our streets, from the Rwanda scheme to“great replacement” theory, a menacing anti-migrant movement has been growling into gear. And we should probably be clear at this point that hotels and small boats were never the endgame.Of course we knew right from the start that “legitimate concerns over immigration” always had a kernel of racial purification at their core. The tropes and elisions of rightwing discourse – “traditional British values”, “Londonistan”, “multiculturalism” – were always mere euphemisms for simpler and more sinister desires. What has been left unsaid, until relatively recently, has been the other half of the equation: how these desires were going to be sated. The roundups and deportations, families being handcuffed and strapped into planes, the wartime-style powers that would create a permanently hostile environment for anyone deemed insufficiently native. This is the omertà that is gradually dissolving.View image in fullscreenFlags on Westminster Bridge in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, 28 August 2025.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesNaturally, Nigel Farage knew what he was doing when he appeared toexclude women and children from his planto deport 600,000 people in the first term of a Reform government. He is a savvy enough operator to know that there is not yet a political consensus around the mass deportation of families, much less established citizens. But he was careful not to rule it out entirely. “At this stage it’s not part of our plan for the next five years,” he said, leaving himself plenty of room for constructive ambiguity. Recall that as recently as last September Farage was rejecting mass deportations as “a political impossibility”, and it becomes clear that his intention is to shift the window of the acceptable firmly but by small degrees. And in the meantime, there are plenty of loud voices happy to make the case in his absence.You do not even need to wade into the swamp waters of X and Facebook, where “remigration” discourse has spiralled into a kind of mass frenzy, where non-white Britons are routinely hounded with cries of “deport”. The MP Rupert Lowe has published his blueprint for the “mass deportation of illegal migrants”, and of course once you have the levers of power the words “illegal” and “migrant” can mean whatever you want them to mean. “From Epping to the sea, let’s make England Abdul free,” proclaimed the former Conservative and Ukip MP Douglas Carswell said last week. James Catton, the donor manager of Reform UK, has advocated forciblydeporting 10 million people.The paradox here is that these are extreme fringe viewpoints, advocated by a tiny sliver of the British population, and yet with the potential to exert a frighteningly disproportionate influence on a future political class. The mobbed state violence of the Trump administration offers a blueprint for how a broad-based electoral mandate can be leveraged to advance sweeping minoritarian policies, a racist purge enacted under the pretences of popular consent. The burning question, as such, is not how this future can be realised, but who is going to avert it.So it starts with refugees and sex offenders, the publicly palatable victims of state retribution. Where does it go next? Perhapsrecent legal migrants, as advocated by a Times columnist on Monday. Naturally, human rights law will need to be dismantled in its entirety, allowing the Home Office to be retooled as a weapon of remigration, citizenship to be reimagined as a function of whiteness, entire communities criminalised at the stroke of a pen, a state of perpetual emergency enacted.There will be mistakes and administrative errors that will in reality not be errors but intentional bugs, poison pills in an apparatus of mass fear. A permanently hostile environment, in which the guy who defaces a mosque or racially abuses me in the street knows he will get away with it. We will hear talk of population control and enemies within. Finally, once a few turbulent years have elapsed, once the window has shifted far enough, the knock on the door. At which point, does the rightwing press finally locate its moral compass and scream: no more?Does this still look like dystopian fiction to you? Perhaps a better way of framing the question is to go back two decades, pretend that the ethnic cleansing of the United Kingdom was your ultimate goal, and ask how satisfied you would be with how things had turned out. The nativist fantasies of yesterday are now written into the manifestos of today, and who knows how the manifestos of tomorrow will read. The leader of the Alternative für Deutschland, leading many opinion polls in Germany, has endorsed the mass remigration of migrant communities. The far-right Vox party in Spain has vowed todeport 8 million “foreigners”and has polled as high as 18.9% this year. The project of sealing national borders has, ironically, been a concerted cross-border effort.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most of us have no coherent, overarching vision for how the world should work, much less how we should get there. What we so often describe as politics is, in fact, a series of shoves: splenetic, emotional and with a wilful blindness to consequence that can so easily be exploited by those with a clear destination in mind.And so the politicians and pundits who now crack the whip on immigration need to be asked, right now, where this ends. They should be made to say the thing they are judiciously trying to avoid saying, or to renounce it completely. Bottom line: the idea of mass deportations as a realistic political agenda would have felt as far-fetched two decades ago as the idea of your non-white friends being strapped into a plane does now. This, in itself, should serve as a warning.Jonathan Liew is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I am cool with being uncoolWed 10 Sep 2025 11.24 EDTLast modified on Wed 10 Sep 2025 19.27 EDTShareOn a first date, relatively recently, I put on one of my favourite albums. It was only later that the woman in question described her distress. It wasn’t terminal, but it wasn’t far off. “I just had to accept that you weren’t the man I thought you were.” Blimey. “I thought you might have bad taste in a heavy metal kind of way, but I wasn’t prepared for this yacht rock.”This album I’d long loved was, apparently, irredeemably naff. It was Breakfast in America by Supertramp. Earlier this week, when I heard thatthe band’s co-founder Rick Davies had died, I was sad. Does this make me even naffer? I suspect it does.But I don’t care. I go back a long way with Supertramp. I had all the albums; the day after my last A-level exam, a friend and I went to London to see them at Earls Court. I bought a sleeveless T-shirt from the merchandise stall, which was doubtless naff, and I wore it for years, which presumably was also a naff thing to do. Naff, naff, naff. Whatever. I just don’t care. I embrace my own naffness. What’s the alternative? Choose something else to enjoy? Pointless. You don’t choose what music you like any more than what football team you support. These things choose you.Still, it turns out that naff doesn’t mean quite what I thought it meant. My dictionary has it as inferior, worthless, vulgar, socially crass, all of which strike me as being a bit on the heavy side. I mean, I can’t imagine anyone disliking Supertramp to the extent that they’d use such harsh words to describe them. No, they’d just say their music was a bit, well, naff. As in, uncool. Yes, that’s it: uncool. And I’m cool with being uncool.I’ve been this way a while now. When I left home for university in autumn 1986, I took my record collection with me, oblivious to the puzzlement, derision and even alarm some of my albums would cause fellow freshers. Supertramp were in there, as well as a good many Abba albums, a very long time before Abba had their renaissance. But my new friends were into stuff like Echo & the Bunnymen, Joy Division and whatnot. Being an open-minded, anxious-to-please young chap, I gave their choices the respect they deserved. I have to say that this was rarely reciprocated.Rick Davies brought a peculiar funk to Supertramp, a band that existed on its own unfashionable termsRead morePicture the scene: returning to halls after the student bar had closed, back to my room to drink, smoke and bond. I slipped Abba The Album out of its cover, dropped the needle on the vinyl, and the opening track, Eagle, played out loud and proud. Consternation. Cigarettes hung from mouths agape, their ash lengthening, drooping and falling disconsolate on to laps. Concerned glances were exchanged. Who was this strange creature? And he seemed so normal! One of the young men in the room was a Stiff Little Fingers fan from Consett. Later he said I’d given him cause to wonder if punk had somehow bypassed the West Midlands altogether.I tried Supertramp instead. No better. Rod Stewart caused an even bigger outcry. The night was long, especially I daresay for my companions. I rifled through my library looking for something, anything, to keep my head above the rising sea of scorn. A lad from Bristol said he was into Lead Belly. I tried Led Zeppelin on him, but it didn’t wash. I felt I’d slightly redeemed myself with John Martyn and Van Morrison, but only slightly.When Abba made it back from the cultural wilderness to assume the status of global icons, I felt a certain bitterness that fans like me, who’d stayed with them throughout, hadn’t had our loyalty recognised in some way. I made this point to Benny when I got to interview him. He smiled and nodded and said he appreciated my support. Nice.

But one quirk aboutWalesI really dislike is how increasingly often I hear it said that its inhabitants should have less say over their lives. As if any people would ever wantlesspower.Time and again you hear this view espoused – most recently by Reform UK’s sole member of the Welsh Senedd, Laura Anne Jones. In her former incarnation as a minor Tory, Jones entered the public consciousness in Wales only a few times. Once was whenshe used a racist slurto describe Chinese people. Another was when she defected from the Conservatives to join Reform in July because she “just suddenly felt that the Conservative party was unrecognisable”. I am sure this had nothing to do with the fact that the Tories are facing near wipeout in Wales in next May’s election. And what has Jones done since in her role as the lone Reform MS? Well, at the first Reform party conference this week she quickly announced that the party is “not ruling out” abolishing the Senedd.Jones is not the first politician to consider abolishing Wales’s parliament, the foundation of which was the culmination of decades of campaigning and a declaration of Welsh nationhood. Less than a year ago the then leader of the Welsh Tories,Andrew RT Davies, was ousted after he flirted with an anti-devolution stance. Just a month ago former Reform MS Rupert Lowe called for the “Assembly” (it hasn’t been called that for half a decade)to be abolished. Though why the MP for Great Yarmouth felt his opinion was worth anything on this topic is a mystery. When I spoke to Lee Andersonlast yearat the Reform party’s Welsh conference he told me that he was “not a fan” of devolution and that it was a “disaster” but at least it will give his party a chance to “win lots of seats”at the next election“which they can use to their advantage”. It is clear from the many conversations I have had with people within Reform, that they see the Senedd as a chanceto massively increasetheir party’s resources ahead of a future general election.These comments underscore an arrogance, hypocrisy and disdain that is all too often applied to Wales and our hard-won right to manage many of our own affairs. Devolution for Cymru was introduced in 1999 after a referendum in 1997 in which the people of Walesvoted narrowlyin favour of it. Then in 2011 there was another referendum on whether the then National Assembly of Wales should receive full law-making powers in the 20 areas over which it had control. This second referendum was much more conclusive, withmore than 63%in favour.In the last Senedd election the anti-devolution party Abolish gotless than 2%of the vote. The Welsh have repeatedly voted for devolution in referendums. It seems that for Jones et al, it is fine to dismiss the democratic will of the people as long as they are Welsh.That I find this annoying (to say the least) doesn’t mean that I think there are no issues with how devolution is now constructed – there absolutely are. The state ofWelsh public servicesis a national embarrassment. I fail to see how anyone can look at Welsh Labour’s stewardship of Wales and conclude it is anything other than a failure. You can’t have the worst performing NHS and the worst education results after two and a half decades in power and pretend this is working well.When polled, a not insignificant minority of people in Wales have saidthey want to scrap our Senedd. I totally understand why some people in Wales look at devolution and say, “this is not working”. But the answer isn’t to scrap it. If your car breaks down you don’t say, “oh well, better just walk from now on”. You repair or upgrade it.The argument seems to be that because Welsh public services are bad, the Welsh should no longer manage their own affairs. This attitude underscores how Wales is viewed within the union. If Scotland’s government performs badly, the argument from (often London-based) commentators is rarely, “let’s abolish the Scottish parliament”. It is rather, “the Scots need to get rid of the SNP”. When Westminster presides over abysmal waiting lists or pays billions onCovid contractsto the mates of cabinet ministers, no one says, “let’s abolish Westminster”. They argue to reform it, or change the voting system, but not that we should abolish UK democracy altogether. Only in the case of Wales is it apparently acceptable to say that a UK nation is uniquely unqualified to make decisions about its own future.What is frustrating about Wales having to continually justify its right to its own parliament is that it distracts from the fact that the system absolutely needs change. Be under no illusions: you could put the most competent government in history in power at Cardiff Bay and it would still struggle to tackle Wales’s challenges. The system currently sets Wales up to fail. While the Welsh government has a £23bn budget and control over our health service, it has less borrowing power than a council. It also has strict limits on how much of its budget it is able to carry over, which artificially hamstrings the Welsh government and punishes prudent spending.Back in 2023 the Welsh government asked the Tories in Westminster to be allowed to carry over an extra £150m thatit hadn’t spent. This was rejected and the Treasury took that money away from Wales. While you could blame the Welsh government for its poor financial planning, this system of funding is bonkers. How can any government operate effectively in these circumstances?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We need the system to be rationalised so that it makes logical sense. We need it to be fair so that Wales doesn’t get shaftedover rail funding, among other things.What Welsh democracy doesn’t need is charlatans who only see Wales as a tool for generating social media engagement. We shouldn’t have to spend our time justifying our rights to the same status as other UK nations.

With 399 MPs and a working majority of 156, why should he?One reason is that those numbers mark a high tide of anti-Tory feeling that receded as soon as Rishi Sunak’s rotten administration was swept away. Voters from diverse places with disparate grievances embraced Starmer’s promise of change, often uncertain what it meant in practice. They needed reasons to be glad of the choice they had made and haven’t found them. Support for the government has tanked as a result.Labour MPs are miserable. There is disaffection in every faction. It afflicts even the cadre of ultra-loyal “Starmtroopers” whose selection as parliamentary candidates was supposed to guarantee a compliant Commons. Ambitious newbies who thought they were embarking on a political career are doubtful of survival at the next election. They are less easily induced to obedience by whips.This is another reason why Starmer needs to get into the bridge-building trade. Labour, like all parties, is a coalition of divergent opinions held together by an intuitive sense of common history and purpose. A leader can alienate some supporters for the sake of election success if pragmatic compromise doesn’t look like dissolution of core principle, and as long as it works. Starmer passed those tests in opposition. Now, not so much.Cabinet changes hastened byAngela Rayner’s resignationare supposed to consolidate the prime minister’s grip on policy, promoting people who will drive the Starmer agenda harder and faster. Shabana Mahmood is tasked with getting immigration, legal and irregular, under control with more alacrity than Yvette Cooper. Pat McFadden must transform “economically inactive” benefit claimants into productive workers by some method that eluded Liz Kendall. That will free up money for Rachel Reeves, one of the few cabinet members not to have been shuffled, to invest in public services and growth-boosting infrastructure. This is “phase two” of the project, when the public should start to notice delivery of the change that was promised.To disgruntled Labour MPs it looks like doubling down on a failing strategy. Some discontent will be flushed out in the competition tofill the deputy party leadership postthat Rayner vacated. The belief that tax raids on hoarded wealth can obviate the need for painful budget cuts will get an airing. So will the view that Reeves’s fiscal rules are more disposable than she (or the bond market she can feel breathing down her neck) supposes.That debate won’t settle the bigger strategic problem that Starmer’s main rival isNigel Farage, and that Reform UK’s preferred campaign issue lures the prime minister ever-further from his party’s comfort zone. Labour can’t afford to ignore public demand for immigration control. But Starmer’s apparent acceptance of Farage’s argument – that Britain is swamped with marauding foreigners – drives demoralised progressive voters elsewhere, to the Liberal Democrats, the Greens or the new party headed by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana.The Labour leadership has been slow to recognise a threat on that flank. Smaller parties are seen as unserious, not contenders for power, receptacles for midterm protest votes. When a general election focuses attention on the question of who should run the country, and the choice is binary – Starmer or Farage – the raised stakes bring a different calculus into play.That’s the theory, and there is evidence to support it. The Labour leader’s approval ratings are abysmal, but he beats his Reform counterpart on the question ofpreferred candidate to be prime minister.Fear of the alternative is an incomplete plan to woo voters who have fled leftwards. The missing component is a sense of the country moving in the right direction. There is time to make that happen. But squandering the first year, when public goodwill and party discipline were likely to be at their peak, was not an encouraging start.Large parties have always counted on support from people who hold their noses and vote for the candidate they don’t like to obstruct the one they despise. But that dynamic might be changing in an era of alienation from all mainstream political institutions.The veteran pollster Peter Kellnerdraws the distinctionbetween political “consumers” and “devotees” of a party. The former make a transactional choice. The latter connect with their preferred party on an emotional level, as validation of identity. Green and Reform supporters tend to be devotees. Labour’s 2024 election win was the aggregate of many consumer choices. If people don’t like the taste of what they are being served, they won’t stay loyal to the brand.To get a sense of what that decay looks like if not reversed, Labour MPs can glance across the Commons at the pitiful state of theConservatives. Kemi Badenoch has not sparked the interest of non-aligned political consumers, and the spirit of radical rightwing devotion now fires Reform. The Tory leader shows no interest in winning back the scores of former heartland seats that elected Lib Dem MPs last year, nor any understanding of why that happened.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some Tory MPs expect a tipping point next year, probably after local and devolved elections, when it becomes clear that Farage can offer better prospects of a seat and maybe even a return to power. Then a trickle of defections becomes a flood.The era in which any party can poll higher than the low 30s may be over. An electoral system that gave a perverse picture of national preferences when there was a two-party duopoly goes completely haywire when four or five parties score in the high teens or 20s.Last year, Labour campaign strategists shrewdly gamed the caprice of first past the post to convert a modest 33.7% share into a huge majority. Farage couldplausibly replicate that trick. To become prime minister, he doesn’t need to be embraced by the nation, just preferred by enough people in enough seats, and for his rivals to take big enough chunks out of each other’s support.Just as feasibly, he could be thwarted by the anyone-but-Farage majority. Lib Dems might continuesiphoning moderate ex-Tory votersaway from Badenoch’s moribund party. Ed Davey would be in a position to enable a second Starmer term, even if Labour sheds scores of seats.These are speculations about a distant realm. Last year’s election feels long ago. The one before that seemed to herald a decade ofBoris Johnson hegemony. He was gone within three years. Not much is predictable in this era of fractured trust and fragmented allegiance. Except perhaps that politics won’t be contained by the old party lines and all leaders, including the current prime minister, should get into the business of building coalitions.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerGeneral election 2024Nigel FarageReform UKKemi BadenochConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

He lives with my mum, who is also in her 80s, in a two-bedroom apartment in Canberra. My mum has multiple sclerosis, which makes looking after a fit, otherwise healthy man with Alzheimer’s very challenging.Dad cannot think in any structured way. He can’t really understand what’s going on around him and he can’t follow verbal instructions. He’s too big and strong to wrestle in and out of clothes, the way you would with a small child, but he has to be wrestled in and out of clothes fairly often because he also doesn’t really understand when he needs to go to the toilet.He likes to go out for a walk every morning and many afternoons, but he can’t go by himself because he has no idea where he is and how to get home. My mum can’t go with him due to her multiple sclerosis, which also means she gets very tired and needs a lot of rest which, when you live with a six-foot-tall toddler who really wants to go outside, is impossible.Labor’s new home care plan could price some elderly people out of laundry and showering help, watchdog warnsRead moreThe situation is clearly not sustainable. While they get support every morning – someone comes to feed, shower and dress Dad – for the rest of the day, most days, Mum looks after him, which is wearing her out. My brother has his own family with its own issues (a classic “sandwich” situation) and I live in a different state. So we decided it was time to put Dad into care. This was an emotionally difficult decision but once we had made it we congratulated ourselves on being calm and sensible and planning ahead, rather than waiting for an emergency.It turns out there areno rooms in aged carefor people like my dad. We filled in forms, we made phone calls, we waited on wait lists for months, but nothing happened. Eventually, one day, I burst into tears talking to the manager of a home, and for whatever reason he was moved to help me. A place was found. We filled in more forms. Dad was admitted and we all felt a horrible mix of guilt and relief.The next day, when I went in to visit him, the home manager said they would not be able to keep him: he walked around a lot and couldn’t understand instructions (including very important instructions about which room was his and which rooms he shouldn’t go into), and that was disruptive. They didn’t have the staff or the skills to care for him. But, I said, we told you he has dementia: this is dementia. They shrugged and said, we can’t look after him.For two weeks we tried to get him into another home in their network, one that did have the staff and the skills, but there were no beds. Then for the next two weeks, while they sent us emails telling us all the reasons Dad was no good (while I writhed with guilt about him going into other people’s rooms and frightening them), we tried every other home in Canberra, explaining it was an emergency. There were no beds.We called the government’s aged care support service and asked them what to do. They said, check the room finder on our website: look, there are beds available in all these homes! But I have called all those homes, I told them, and there are no beds. Wow, they said: they should update their website! I agreed that that would be good, and that was the end of our conversation.Several of the people we spoke to said you should put your dad in the hospital. If you do that, they assured us, he will be very quickly admitted into a suitable aged care home. We didn’t want to put Dad in the hospital. Dad fears and loathes hospitals, and I felt like even a few days in hospital would be the end of him. Never mind that one of the reasons everyone’s surgery keeps getting delayed and ambulances line up for hours outside emergency rooms is that hospital beds are full of old people who have nowhere safe to go.In the end, though, we couldn’t think of any other options so we called the hospital. No, they said, you cannot just drop your dad off here and expect us to look after him; which, I thought, was fair enough.The other week the home finally kicked my dad out and he is now back with my mum. He is great – full of enthusiasm for life, cheerful and affectionate. But imagine spending all day every day with someone who cannot sit still, who cannot stop talking, who doesn’t ever listen to anything you say, who cannot make sense, who will not take his shoes off or put them on. If you are the parent of a young child, you know what this is like – in this case, though, the child is bigger and stronger than you are, and people in the street do not look at him and say he is cute. His Alzheimer’s will get worse, my mum will get weaker, neither of them are safe and nothing will be done until there is an emergency. And that will be too late.Jane Rawson is a novelist, essayist, editor and PhD student.

ObsceneArwa MahdawiTesla’s board is dangling a gargantuan payout in front of its chief. Is it a manipulative ploy or a desperate stunt?Wed 10 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTShareBribery is generally unethical and often illegal, but also quite effective. When my four-year-old is acting up and ignoring my increasingly desperate pleas for her to get dressed, leave the playground or do something else very important, I have, on occasion, resorted to desperate promises of ice-cream. Obviously, I know it’s counterproductive to respond to suboptimal behaviour with sugar-based bribes. But sometimes you are exhausted and just need a short-term win. The ice-cream always delivers.It seems trying to motivate a four-year-old is not much different from trying to keep a petulant 54-year-old tech mogul in line.On Friday, Tesla’s board of directors rolled out a pay package proposal for CEO Elon Musk that could, if he plays his cars right, turn the billionaire into the world’s first trillionaire. In a section of Tesla’s latest stock market update that began: “Yes, you read that correctly”, the board outlines everything Musk has to do to get his hands on that performance-based trillion. Which, to be fair, is a lot. Tesla needs to reach a market cap of $8.5tn, eight times its current value, in 10 years to get Musk the payout. Many analysts believe Tesla is alreadyovervalued, so this is no small task.Still, a challenge and reward of this magnitude seem a cunning way to harness the power of Musk’s oversized ego. If anything can get Musk to stop stoking culture wars and fathering children, in order to focus on the companies he is supposed to be running, it may well be the prospect of becoming the world’s first trillionaire.Gavin Newsom is taking the fight to Trump – but for whom is he fighting? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreEfficacy aside, a potential trillion-dollar pay package in a world where almost 700 million people live onless than $2.15 a dayis obscene. Making it even more enraging is Musk’s handy knack for failing upwards. The billionaire’s stint running the Department of Government Efficacy (Doge), his short-lived pet project, left chaos and a trail of destruction in its wake. Global health officials have said, for example, that Doge’s USAID cuts have led to cases ofbabies being born with HIV infectionsbecause mothers could not get access to medication, and have warned the cuts could reverse decades of progress. Cuts to educational programmes for low-income families will similarly havelong-term ramifications. And for what? APolitico analysislast month found Doge saved less than 5% of what it claimed in cancelled contracts.Musk is nowdeeply unpopularand a lot of people want to see him get his just deserts. Tesla, meanwhile, just wants him to get back to work in the private sector and is dangling the prospect of the biggest ice-cream the world has ever seen.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For anyone who doubted Benjamin Netanyahu’s commitment to the forever war he unleashed after 7 October, the attempt to wipe out Hamas’s ceasefire negotiation team in Doha offered grim confirmation that peace – and the return of Israeli hostages – is low on Mr Netanyahu’s list of current priorities.Just how close Hamas’s leadership was to endorsing ceasefire proposals backed by Donald Trump – which were being discussed in the capital of an established US ally – is unclear. However, Mr Netanyahu’s strike has ensured that its negotiators will not agree to sit round a table again anytime soon. Israel swiftlystatedthat the attack was in response to theHamas-claimedshootingin Jerusalem on Monday, in which six people died. But it also occurred as the Israeli militaryorderedthe complete evacuation of Gaza City, ahead of a full-scale invasion that will bring further death and destruction to a starving, traumatised population.It could not be plainer that ending the suffering is not compatible with the goals of Mr Netanyahu, and the far-right allies on which his government depends. But faced with such contemptuous intransigence – and growingevidencethat those goals include establishing a “Greater Israel” stretching beyond 1967borders– the west’s response is pusillanimous and painfully inadequate.As Mr Trump issues ignored deadlines and empty exhortations topeaceon social media, Mr Netanyahu is deploying US-derived military might to act with impunity, unilaterally striking targets when and where he wishes. Yet though the president criticised Israel after Tuesday’s attack for violating the sovereignty of a US ally, he also made a point of approving the general aim of eliminating Hamas. For Mr Trump, it appears that there are no truly red lines for Israel’s extremist government to cross.Against that alarming and dangerous backdrop, it is imperative that Sir Keir Starmer and other European leaders seek to exert greater pressure both on Washington and Israel itself. Before controversially meeting the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, on Wednesday, Sir Keir loftilyinsistedthat abandoning diplomatic efforts towards a lasting peace deal would amount to “student politics”. But Israel’s attempted assassination of participants in that process, in Doha this week, should lend a certain perspective on the value of words alone.As a recent report by MPs on the foreign affairs select committeeconcluded, Britain must be far bolder and tougher in the measures it is willing to take to isolate a government whose war crimes are taking place in plain sight. The European Union must also follow up familiar rhetoric with consequential action, designed to deliver a meaningful economic impact. Ultimately, only the US can force Israel’s prime minister to bring his genocidal campaign in Gaza to an end. But Europe’s passivity has played its part in strengthening Mr Netanyahu’s conviction that he can shape the Middle East’s future according to the extremist designs of his far-right cabinet colleagues.Formal recognitions of Palestinian statehood, some of which willtake placeat this month’s United Nations general assembly, carry a welcome symbolism. But as Mr Netanyahu’s bombs destabilise the wider Gulf region, Gaza’s civilian population braces for the worst once again, and the effective annexation of parts of the West Bank continues, symbolism is not nearly enough.Explore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionQatarHamasIsrael-Gaza warGazaBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Decades passed, and Mr Johnson remained cavalier about following the rules. Propriety, even as prime minister, wasdisgracefullylittle more than performance. His post-office conduct suggests he still treats norms as optional.Leakeddocumentsfrom Mr Johnson’s private office, obtained by the transparency groupDistributed Denial of Secretsand seen by the Guardian, raise grave questions about his adherence to standards – and whether public money has helped fund his post-premiership business empire. They centre on thepublic duty costs allowance(PDCA), an allocation meant to support former prime ministers’ public duties, not their profit-making ventures. Mr Johnson has received £182,000 through the scheme since 2022. But thedocumentssuggest his staff has been working not just on public roles but also on global private deals. Mr Johnson calls the allegations “rubbish”.Five other former prime ministers – Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Theresa May and Liz Truss – havereleasedstatements saying they fully comply with rules prohibiting the use of public funds for private business. Rishi Sunak does not claim the allowance. Mr Johnson’s conduct appears to be an outlier. And not for the first time.This is not just a question of semantics. The ethics watchdog approved Mr Johnson’s 2024 work for a climate consultancy chasingSaudifunds – provided he did not lobby contacts from his time in office. But he’d already made the approach. At about the same time, his taxpayer-funded team was helping him pursue a billion-dollar deal fromAbu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, courting an official he had hosted in No 10. There was no prior approval from the authorities. Mr Johnson didn’t wait for clearance. He was too busy attempting to cash in.One of the more startling revelations shows Mr Johnson was paid £240,000 by a hedge fund weeks after attending a meeting last March between its boss, Maarten Petermann, and theVenezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro– a man Mr Johnson once denounced as a “dictator of an evil regime”. Mr Johnson secretly hosted Mr Petermann for a two-and-a-half-hour lunch at Chequers just 10 days before leaving office. It raises a serious question: was the outgoing prime minister using his final days, and the trappings of office, to lay the ground for future deals?Mr Johnson’s defenders say that he has broken no rules. But that, if true, is precisely the problem. Mr Brown is right to call for former prime ministers to have to make public declarations of their business interests, just as sitting MPs and peers must, and for a stronger code on business appointments. It’s worth thinking about extending the current two-year ban on exploiting past official contacts for private gain. TheNational Audit Office, which scrutinises the PDCA, should investigate Mr Johnson. This is no witch-hunt. It’s about restoring faith in the belief that the conventions of public life cannot be flouted with impunity.The historian Peter Hennessy oncecalledMr Johnson the greatest threat to Britain’s “good chap” model – a system built not on law but shared decency. That model is broken. What’s needed is real bite, not the toothless oversight committee that Labourrightly scrapped. The evidence points to high office used for gain. If not highly irregular, it is morally corrupt – and corrosive to public life.Explore more on these topicsBoris JohnsonOpinionGordon BrownNicolás MaduroConservativeseditorialsShareReuse this content"

The way is now open for Zack Polanski’s Greens, 3 September).Polanski himself lays out his core policy story and says his party’s “central mission” is to turn its 40 second-place finishes in 2024 into Green MPs at the next election (This is the Green party’s moment – not Farage’s. As leader, I’ll offer real solutions to Britain’s problems, 2 September). But to get there he has to build popularmovements and shed populist slogans. He’ll have to choose between grandiose rhetoric and realistic politics.As Monbiot says, the Greens offer “a deep and thoughtful agenda” and could end up “holding the balance of power”. But, whatever gains they and the Jeremy Corbyn-Zarah Sultana party make, over the next few years the crucial priority for all progressives will be to halt and reverse the rise of the Farage right. That will require a popular front across the progressive spectrum. Only the blinkered will fail to see the need to work together wherever possible and direct their firepower against the main danger.Jon BloomfieldCo-author, The Little Black Book of the Populist RightI was intrigued by George Monbiot’s article. When it came to the Greens’ manifesto, almost every proposal was what I had hoped to see in theLabourparty’s manifesto. Some aspects of it were very ambitious, such as introducing a fairer voting and party funding system or a more redistributive tax settlement, but overall it made me think twice about whom I would be voting for in the next election, although I have been a lifelong Labour supporter.Martyn BrewsterNottinghamReading or watching the news has become a major challenge for optimists, so it was heartwarming to put the Guardian down with a feeling of real hope.Zack Polanskiand George Monbiot are both word-perfect in assessing not only the danger posed by Nigel Farage and the failure of Keir Starmer to address Britain’s systemic problems, but in providing a vision that offers real change.Hopefully, the Greens can attract disenchanted Labour MPs to join them so they are joined in parliament by experienced MPs. They will also need to respond positively to the billionaire press, which will attack them relentlessly.Geoffrey PayneEaling, LondonAndy Beckett (Authoritative to authoritarian: rightwing radicalisation is blurring the Conservatives’ political red lines, 5 September) talks of a changing political landscape that is “pushing the Green party to the left”, presumably a nod to the election of the “ecopopulist” Zack Polanski as party leader.Anyone who has glanced atGreen partyelection manifestos over the last 20 years will be aware that it has been the UK’s only constant proponent of leftwing ideas over that time. Examples include championing the nationalisation of railway, water and energy companies, increasing taxation of well-off people to fund services for all, costing its ideas on how to tackle the climate crisis and propounding the sensible idea that we will have to measure success by something other than economic growth.The Green party hasn’t been pushed anywhere. It has always been a socialist party.Mark GrettonHullHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

How does the National Audit Office know that costs are fairly apportioned between whatever the duties of a former prime minister are supposed to be and the business activities of those MPs?

I now realise I was wrong, 7 September) and thought – “it’s not just in my head”. The far right isn’t creeping back. It’s marching in, boots on, flags waving, and people are clapping along like it’s Eurovision.As a working-class woman of colour, I’m exhausted. Not just from the racism and misogyny, but from how normal it’s all starting to feel again. Like we’re rewinding to a time when public figures could say vile things about migrants, Muslims or “woke women” and still get invited on to Question Time with a smile and a fresh haircut. The vile attitudes that Rohan’s dad had to endure are resurfacing.Meanwhile, people are glued to Love Is Blind, pretending none of it’s happening. And honestly? Fair play. Life’s hard enough. Bills are brutal, jobs are insecure and the world’s basically on fire both literally and politically. But while we’re debating which walking red flag should marry whom on telly, men accused of violence against women are being platformed as truth-tellers. Athletes and celebrities with long rap sheets still trend like national heroes.This isn’t just racism. It’s misogyny dressed up as “anti-establishment”. It’s scapegoating, gaslighting and old-fashioned hate, but now with better lighting and TikTok filters. I get the temptation to switch off. To scroll past, to self-care my way into oblivion. But we don’t have that luxury any more. Not if you’re a woman or brown or broke, or all three.Here’s the uncomfortable truth: the far right is getting organised.

Moreover, his proposals would probably disproportionately impact public sector workers because of their membership of defined benefit pension schemes.A significant reduction of the tax-free cash payment may deliver some savings from such schemes. According tofigureson Dan Neidle’s Tax Policy Associates website – capping the benefit at £100k might save £5bn – a sum that might usefully offset a few weeks of government debt interest payments each year.But the issue of making savings from moderating tax relief on pension contributions is much less straightforward – particularly for large unfunded schemes where the pension contributions are generally used to cover the costs of pensions in payment.By way of example, according to a recentpublicationfrom the NHS Business Service Authority, the NHS pension scheme paid out around £18bn to pensioners in 2024-25 – the majority of which was covered from employer contributions (about £16bn). Sometimes such schemes have surplus cash – which can be returned to the exchequer, but of course in years when there is a deficit, the exchequer would have to provide further support to cover the pensions in payment.Changes to tax relief would, over time, probably make an impact on the rate of increase of overall pension liabilities. But in the immediate term it is a zero-sum game, because the taxpayer covers the whole costs of contributions and meets any additional unexpected liabilities.Then of course we have to consider human responses to proposed tax changes. Some higher-rate tax-paying “boomers” fortunate enough to have a public sector pension might simply decide toretireand draw on their pension – behaviour that would not necessarily benefit the exchequer or the operational effectiveness of public services on which most of us rely.Prof Stephen CaddickWorthing, West SussexExplore more on these topicsEconomic policyPensionsRachel ReevesTax and spendingBudget deficitlettersShareReuse this content"

The head coach feels competition for places has increased afterthe 5-0 World Cup qualifying win against Serbiain Belgrade on Tuesday – especially in the No 10 role.Tuchel watchedMorgan Rogers produce an outstanding performancein the position, the Aston Villa player’s best moment being the first-time flick that sent Noni Madueke through to score the second goal. Roy Keane, who covered the game for ITV, compared Rogers to Paul Gascoigne in terms of the X factor he provides.The road to the 2026 World Cup: who has qualified and who is at riskRead moreTuchel had brought Rogers into the lineup at the expense of Eberechi Eze, who was the No 10 inthe 2-0 home victory against Andorra on Saturday. Tuchel, who named a slimmed-down 24‑man squad for the fixtures, had Morgan Gibbs-White on the bench. Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer and Phil Foden, the bigger-name options for the role, missed out because of fitness issues.“I am always brave – you know that,” Tuchel said, when asked about the possibility of having to drop an A‑lister. “We took some brave decisions already. We nominated a squad of only 21 [outfield players] to keep the competition going.“The competition for places is on – if you are in camp, you are in your best behaviour, your best shape, best form and you make the best of it. It’s a privilege to be in camp and then fight for your place … if you can help everyone to be better and to grow. This is what we did.”View image in fullscreenMorgan Rogers staked a claim to the No 10 role for England with his display in the win against Serbia.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersEngland took a major step towards automatic qualification for the World Cup with the victory in Belgrade, and Tuchel also outlined the sense that his squad would not be reliant on one or two stellar talents – asEnglandhave been in the past. Everybody can remember the panic that gripped, for example, when David Beckham and Wayne Rooney became injury doubts on the eve of tournaments.“If a big player misses out on a tournament, we need to have solutions; if he misses a camp, we need to have solutions,” Tuchel said. “We have to focus on the guys who are available and who are ready to be the best versions of themselves and the best teammate possible.“This is a team sport and it was teamwork in its purest form against Serbia. The players have the quality to play for us and the hunger to play and everyone gets his chance.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersnewsShareReuse this content"

This was initially set up as a nine-over contest, only for a further shower to cut short the touring side’s innings at 97 for five from 7.5. With any extra time already spent, the upshot was England being tasked with chasing 69 in just five overs.It proved too great an ask, ultimately, with the need for Harry Brook’s side to go hard from the outset resulting in a succession of mis‑hit dismissals caught in the ring. In the end, despite Jos Buttler clearing the rope three times for an 11-ball 25, they stuttered to 54 for five from their allocation.“It was a bit of a shambles of a night,” Brook said, unhappy that the match went ahead and still stewing on a fourth-ball duck. “You can’t take much from that. It was very wet but that’s down to the match officials – we don’t get to decide.”Kudos to South Africa, who put a low price on their wickets and cleared the rope nine times after being sent in. Aiden Markram led the charge with 28 from 14, before Dewald Brevis, 23 from 10, and Donovan Ferreira, 25 not out from 11, ensured an early wobble was not ruinous. Even with a short straight hit available at Sophia Gardens, all three are serious ball-strikers.And save for one ultimately inconsequential drop off Sam Curran late on in the chase, the tourists held their nerve in the field. Kagiso Rabada struck with his first ball of the tour – he missed the one-day international series with an ankle issue – followed by two wickets apiece for Marco Jansen and Corbin Bosch. Despite the drop in overs, two bowlers could still send down two apiece.View image in fullscreenDonovan Ferreira plays a shot for South Africa in Cardiff.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersEngland named a spin-heavy XI a day before the match but, given the quickfire nature of the contest, there was a strong case to bring in a fourth seamer. There was also the risk of injury on the greasy outfield to consider, not least for a player such as Jofra Archer so close to the Ashes tour this winter.Not that Brook could say as much when he won the toss, elected to bowl first, and announced Luke Wood for Archer as the one change. “We felt like we wanted Luke to come in and hit the poles early with his swing,” the England captain said, as if this was a genuine tactical switch rather than a precious commodity being stuck in bubble wrap.Still, despite the inference that he was more expendable, Wood delivered the impact that Brook ordered (if not the stumplosion) with figures of two for 22 from two overs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Either way, a response from his fielders followed, with some slick work in the deep followed by Wood holding a fine swirling effort off Markram. As well as handing Adil Rashid a wicket, it reduced South Africa to 37 for three from 3.4 overs.Enter Brevis, the wunderkind fresh from securing a record £700,000 contract in the SA20 a day earlier and celebrating with three audacious sixes that put the touring side back in the ascendancy. That was until Curran came on for his first England appearance this year and induced a skewed wipe to short third courtesy of a 51mph slower ball.However, despite the further loss of Tristan Stubbs to a Jamie Overton yorker, Ferreira continued with the long-handle and South Africa muscled their way to a strong total. When Phil Salt followed an earlier drop by pulling Rabada’s first ball to long leg, it set the tone for what was to follow.Explore more on these topicsCricketEngland cricket teamSouth Africa cricket teamTwenty20match reportsShareReuse this content"

So his words carry extra weight, particularly when it comes to the 800m, the event in which he held the world record for 18 years.Raising the bar: Duplantis leads the stars aiming to break world records in TokyoRead moreWhen asked whether Hodgkinson, who tookOlympic gold in Paris, could end her career as one of the greatest athletes Britain has produced, Coe was emphatic – and then went even further. “Yeah, she absolutely could,” he replied.“I’ve no doubt about that. Absolutely, for sure. And she could end up at the top of the heap internationally if she goes on. I’ve spoken to her enough times to know that mentally she’s mahogany hard. She is absolutely committed to wanting to end her career top of the heap and there’s no reason why she shouldn’t.”Coe also praised Hodgkinson’s coaches, Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows, for getting her back to her best after hamstring and back issues. The 23-year-old ran 1min 54sec in August in Silesia, her first run for 376 days, before a 1:55in Lausanne four days later.View image in fullscreenSebastian Coe greets a triumphant Keely Hodgkinson after she won her 800m gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics.Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters“You have to marvel at how she has come back,” Coe said. “To be out injured and then basically your first step foot on the track and you’re running 1:54. We’ve been saying this for a long time, she is the real deal.“The only caution I would counsel is sometimes you’re so keen to get back into competition that you almost perform above the level of endurance and fitness that you have. What I thought was quite clever was doing two races back-to-back because what she was clearly testing was that thesis really.“Did she have enough in the tank to go back-to-back? Which is what she’s going to be asked to do in Tokyo? And the answer was clearly a resounding yes.”Coe also said that he had been excited by Gout, who has already run a wind-assisted 9.98sec for the 100m and a 19.84 for 200m.View image in fullscreenAustralian teenager Gout Gout is shaping up to be a sprint sensation.Photograph: Richard Wainwright/AAP“At 17 I was probably just about qualifying for the inter-counties,” Coe said. “He’s an outstanding athlete. I was very privileged to have supper with him after the Diamond League in Monaco, with his coach. A really, really good Australian coach. A female coach [Di Sheppard], too, which is always good.“He’s very level-headed. He’s clearly got a lot of talent. He’s got, in James Templeton, a good manager that isn’t forcing him too quickly. Clearly he is the real deal.“The biggest challenge is to take an athlete from his age through the next three or four years into the senior ranks, safely, mentally in decent shape and physically not badly damaged. I thought he was incredibly level‑headed. Seemed to know what he was doing. I think it’s a great story.”Athletics can’t keep kidding itself – it needs a five-pronged plan to save track and field | Sean IngleRead moreBut while the Australian media are in force in Tokyo to follow Gout, Coe said it was too early to burden him with the expectation of a medal. “It will be a huge learning curve for him,” Coe said. “He’s probably at this moment too young to be afraid and doesn’t quite understand how complicated it gets later on.”Coe also insisted that WorldAthleticswould be ready for a typhoon in Tokyo after the tropical storm Tapah caused dozens of flights to be cancelled out of Hong Kong on Monday. “First of all, let’s hope there isn’t one,” he said. “Second, we do have the full meteorological prediction and predictive teams out there at the moment.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsKeely HodgkinsonWorld Athletics ChampionshipsSebastian CoeGout GoutnewsShareReuse this content"

The use of airport-style scanners led to huge queues outside the arena.The Ryder Cup will have a bigger attendance – about 50,000 per day – and has no scope to change starting times. Most of the gallery typically want to be in place first thing in the morning for the initial tee shots.Sources says the Ryder Cup organisers are trying to be proactive so that Friday morning play and crowds are unaffected. Spectators have paid $750 for tickets as the US team attempt to reclaim the Ryder Cup from Europe.A spokesperson for the PGA of America said: “While President Trump has indicated interest in attending the 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage, specific details have not been confirmed. As we get closer to Ryder Cup week, we will communicate any relevant updates that may impact the Ryder Cup experience. Our priority remains delivering a seamless, secure and first-class event for all our guests.”Luke Donald, the European captain, has admitted his team will need to be ready for the fuss created by Trump’s appearance. Donald said: “There was some delays at the tennis. I think you’re probably all aware of that but hopefully they have learnt from that.“It’s a big process, obviously, to get a president to come to an event. There’s a lot of security and everything. It takes some work, I’m sure. The PGA of America’s job is to make sure it’s seamless. He wants to be there to probably greet the players and I think the crowd is probably going to be loud no matter what.“We know that the president is going to be there, it’s not like he’s just going to turn up and we didn’t expect it, so it’s fine.”Trump’s association with golf was emphasised again on Wednesdayyesterday with confirmation that his Doonbeg resort will stage the Irish Open in 2026.Explore more on these topicsRyder CupGolfDonald TrumpUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Eight years ago Itoje and Owen Farrell were forced to sit out one of England’s autumn fixtures after the 2017 Lions tour because of their “exceptional workloads” with Eddie Jones revealing the pair, who missed out on their £25,000 match fees, were furious.The club-country agreement signed last year guarantees Test players an international salary of £160,000, however, and Prem clubs believe the cost of meeting welfare demands could be shared between them and England, who also face Fiji, New Zealand and Argentina this autumn.Clubs can apply for Lions players to be given special dispensation to be available for the start of the season this month.Farrell has been cleared to make his second Saracens debut against Newcastle Red Bulls with his late call‑up to the Lions tour coming after a lengthy injury-enforced break, but in general directors of rugby are abiding by the agreement and want England to share the load.View image in fullscreenOwen Farrell is expected to feature for Saracens from the start of the season after rejoining the club.Photograph: Steve Haag Sports/ShutterstockAsked if Freeman, Henry Pollock, Fin Smith and Alex Mitchell could be rested, the Northampton director of rugby, Phil Dowson, said: “I’ve mooted that. Steve as you know is non-committal when it comes to that stuff. Nearer the time he might be. He’s not going to make any promises now, and I don’t expect him to.“I’ve said my piece, and what I think needs to happen, and everyone at the RFU, [the performance director] Phil Morrow and everyone understands that.”The Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, has given Itoje, Jamie George and Earl an extra week off but Farrell is primed to begin the season with his boyhood club.“Owen is different and he’ll be available for week one,” said McCall, who revealed Elliot Daly is on course to be backfrom his broken armin October. “We haven’t actually spoken about which week [the others] will come back.” Asked if they could be rested by Borthwick, McCall said: “It depends what the Tests are. If there is an ‘easier’ one then those are things that we could have some common sense around, so that it’s fair-ish. But I think if you ask a player then he’ll want to play in international games and we’ll always support that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re going to look after Finn incredibly well, as we have done over the last two years. Our relationship is extremely good.”Curry, meanwhile, has insisted he is “very happy” at Sale despite continued speculation over theR360 breakaway leaguestarting next September.“It sounds like there’s a lot of external noise,” he said. “I’ve not heard anything. It’s everywhere but within the players, if that makes sense. So I don’t know. I’m very happy at Sale. I just think at the club we’re doing a great job.

Those established teams are usually boys teams, so the girls are playing at nine o’clock at night when the facilities have become free.“We think that’s unacceptable, so we’re looking at using the power we’ve got in government to attach conditions to the funding to make sure that doesn’t take place and there is equal access.”Calls for the greater inclusion of girls’ and women’s sport have grown over recent years, in part after the inspirational success ofthe Lionessesand the2021 US Open champion, Emma Raducanu.This year, the government announced it would spend up to £400m on improving grassroots facilities, with an emphasis on making those spaces more inclusive. The Guardian understands that the conditions related to this funding would be extended to include all other sports if the government’s plans are carried out.Last month, the government announcedfunding for two cricket domes, which would allow for year-round play, with one of the venues at Farington, near Preston, intended as a focal point for growing the women’s game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her quickfire delivery of the Queen’s Speech in June 2017 when it clashed with day two of Royal Ascot is the stuff of parliamentary legend. It is said that her relationship with Theresa May, who seemingly scheduled the state opening of parliament without checking the diary, never really recovered.Unprecedented strike shows racing unified to send pre-budget message to Labour over betting duty crisisRead moreSo it was hard not to wonder too on Wednesday what she would have made of racing’s self-imposed “strike”, prompted by concerns that the Treasury will raise the level of duty charged on online betting profits – 15% – to at least the 21% rate now levied on fixed-margin casino products.The proposal to “harmonise” the duty rates for gambling was first floated in the dog days of Rishi Sunak’s premiership, but it survived the transition to the new Labour government and would, according to the British Horseracing Authority’s calculations, cost the sport at least £65m annually.The BHA’s calculation featured in its response to an official consultation on the proposal this year and would, the Authority says, lead inevitably to significant job losses and decline in an industry that directly or indirectly supports 85,000 jobs. As a result, trainers and jockeys from all levels of the sport were among the 200 or so of the turf’s great and good who downed tools for the day to head for the capital.Oisin Murphy, the current champion on the Flat, and Hollie Doyle, the sport’s most successful female rider, were among the jockeys posing in “Axe the Racing Tax” silks in the shadow of Big Ben for a photo opportunity to kick off the day’s proceedings. The rally at the QEII Centre in Parliament Square later in the day, meanwhile, was a protest event with a distinct racing feel – suits and ties, for the most part, and a free bar to lighten the mood. Militancy and racing types will always be a slightly odd mix.View image in fullscreenJockeys including Hollie Doyle and Oisin Murphy show their support for the strike.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesBut it takes more than the promise of a free glass of wine to get so many racing folk down to London in the midst of a tube strike, and the genuine sense of foreboding among professionals and track operators at every level of the sport over the potential tax rise was palpable, too.John Gosden, one of the most successful trainers of recent decades, evoked memories of the Winter of Discontent, as he was starting out as a trainer in the late 1970s, as he warned the audience of what the future might hold.“Our costs of production are absolutely frightening,” Gosden said. “When you compare it to the cost of production of online gambling [on casino products], I think you’re looking at two completely different ball games. I don’t think the government understand our industry.“There is a worldwide symbiotic relationship between racing and betting, and the government needs to be careful. If they tax more, they could end up with less return. Taxes will only undermine and destabilise our industry and result in unemployment, and a further burden on the state. We have an industry to be proud of, and having talked about the 1970s, I do hope that this government doesn’t take us back to the 1970s.”Brant Dunshea, the acting chief executive of the BHA, and Martin Cruddace, the chief executive of Arena Racing Company, one of the biggest racecourse operators, also addressed the rally. “We have always been taxed differently,” Cruddace said, “because of the contribution that we make to the economy and to livelihoods, and because racing is part of the fabric of the culture of this country.”The extent to which racing’s message is being heard where it matters remains to be seen, but around 20 MPs accepted an invitation to the event and Cruddace was due to speak to the all-party parliamentary group for gambling reform later on Wednesday afternoon. “I think we are making incredible progress,” he said, “but we have to keep our foot down. We have eight weeks and it is absolutely vital.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to Nottinghamshire police, the charge is of the most serious Category A offence and relates to a video recovered by officers in February.The charge of making an indecent image of a child refers to activities such as downloading, sharing or saving abuse photos or videos. Images that are classified Category A customarily show children involved in “penetrative sexual activity”, according to Sentencing Council guidelines.Coote was charged on 12 August and is on conditional bail. He is due to appear at Nottingham magistrates court on Thursday.The 43-year-old was sacked by the English refereeing body Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO) last December, after a string of revelations emerged related to his off-field behaviour.One video shared online showed Coote makingabusive comments about the then Liverpool manager Jürgen Kloppin 2020.

But in areport published in Nature on Wednesday, the findings of which were discussed at the press conference, scientists say the features should be regarded as potential signs of life.“Our analysis leads us to conclude that the Bright Angel formation contains textures, chemical and mineral characteristics, and organic signatures that warrant consideration as ‘potential biosignatures’,” they write.“It’s a signature. It’s a sort of leftover sign. It’s not life itself. And it certainly could have been from ancient life, and that would have been something that was there billions of years ago, nothing that’s currently there,” Dr Nicky Fox, associate administrator of Nasa’s science mission directorate, told reporters.Still, she said: “We’re kind of one step closer to answering one of humanity’s most profound questions, and that is: are we truly alone in the universe?”While Mars appears an arid world today, its surface is crossed and dotted with ancient river and lake beds, pointing to a warmer, wetter past. If life ever gained a foothold on the planet, traces may be found in its rocks as organic matter and possibly even fossilised organisms.Dr Joel Hurowitz, a geochemist and planetary scientist at Stony Brook University in New York, and first author on the paper, said the unusual features on the rocks were accumulations of minerals, including an iron-phosphate mineral, vivianite, and an iron sulphide mineral, greigite.“These minerals appear to have formed as a result of reactions between the mud of the Bright Angel formation and organic matter that is also present in that mud,” he said. The reactions appeared to have taken place shortly after the mud was deposited on the lake bed.On Earth, reactions that combine organic matter and chemical compounds in mud to form new minerals, such as vivianite and greigite, are often driven by microbial activity. The microbes consume the organic compounds and produce the minerals as a byproduct of their metabolism.But there are other ways to produce the minerals. “The reason … we cannot claim this is more than a potential biosignature is that there are chemical processes that can cause similar reactions in the absence of biology and we cannot rule those processes out completely on the basis of rover data alone,” Hurowitz said.Hurowitz added: “We should be conservative and stick to the potential biosignature designation until future research and analysis on the sample collected from this geological formation can be performed on Earth.”Largest piece of Mars on Earth sells for over $5m at New York auctionRead moreThe researchers hope the findings will kickstart efforts in laboratories to see if the intriguing features can be recreated through biological and non-biological processes. They also want it to spur fieldwork at sites where similar reactions may have taken place in the past. That would help scientists work out whether the features are biology at work.Ultimately, confirmation may have to wait for Mars rocks, which have been stashed aboard Perseverance, to be brought back to Earth, but Nasa plans for such a mission are badly delayed and in doubt.Scientists have decried what they see as “extinction-level cuts” to Nasa’s science budget by the Trump administration, including the likely axing of theMars sample return missionthat would allow such analysis.Duffy, the transportation secretaryinstalled by Trump at Nasain July after withdrawing his initial nomination, refused to commit to bringing the rocks to Earth, and said it was the subject of “a current analysis”.“We’re looking at how we get this sample back, or other samples back,” Duffy said. “We’re going to look at our timing. And, you know, how do we spend money better, and what technology do we have to get samples back more quickly?”Fox appeared to press the case for more investment in Nasa’s scientific research in light of Wednesday’s announcement.“Nasa science discoveries do not just happen at random. They are the rewarding results of meticulous, long-term strategic planning,” she said.“We send these missions to really address these incredible questions, and each new discovery helps us drive what research is coming next.”In an accompanying article to the report, Dr Janice Bishop, a planetary scientist at the Seti Institute in California and Dr Mario Parente, an expert in remote sensing on planets at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said: “There is no evidence of microbes on Mars today, but if any had been present on ancient Mars, they too might have reduced sulfate minerals to form sulfides in such a lake at Jezero crater.”Explore more on these topicsMarsNasaSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

I feel responsible.View image in fullscreenLeanne Lucas (pictured here before the attack) told the inquiry she felt exposed and criticised for her actions.Photograph: Facebook“I tried so hard to usher as many children out as possible, to get them away from him [the attacker]. I constantly replay what happened over and over in my mind, what I was able to do, what else could I have done, the what ifs.”Her friend Leanne Lucas, with whom she led the workshop, said survival instincts had guided her decision to rush out of the building with children.Lucas, 35, phoned 999 in the “absolute chaos” of trying to escape after Axel Rudakubana stabbed her five times, fracturing her shoulder blade and cutting off parts of her spine. She fell unconscious from her injuries after calling for help.Occasionally breaking to stop her tears, the former primary school teacher said: “I acted in a way to find help as quickly as possible. Living with that knowledge is hard.”Since the attack, Lucas said, she had felt “ostracised” in Southport, her home town, and felt exposed and criticised for her actions: “To some I am called a hero, to others a villain. The truth is, I am neither. I am just Leanne, the woman who did her best in an unthinkable situation.”The attack had left her “excluded from parts of my own community”, she said, adding that she stayed away from events because her presence could distress the families of the children.Lucas added: “I don’t heal alongside or within my community. I feel ostracised in the very town where I built my life.”The inquiry, led by the former appeal court judge Sir Adrian Fulford, is examining the failures to prevent the killing of Bebe King, six; Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven; and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine; and the attempted murder of eight other girls and two adults on 29 July last year.View image in fullscreenBebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice da Silva Aguiar were killed in the knife attack.Photograph: Merseyside police/PALiddle, who was returning to work from maternity leave at the time, described how she frantically tried to usher children to safety as Rudakubana rained down blows with a 20cm (8in) kitchen knife.She saw Lucas being “brutally attacked” and ran with some of the girls to the stairway. One of the children, she noticed, had run in the opposite direction towards a toilet, so she quickly opened the door and locked them both inside.“Whilst in the toilet, the perpetrator was banging and rattling the door attempting to get in – only stopping when the police arrived,” she said. “The girls’ screaming and fearing for our lives haunts me to this day.”Through tears, the mother of two told the inquiry that she responded in a split second to the “most horrendous and terrifying situation I’ve ever been in, one I had never even imagined possible”.She added: “My instinct was to protect all of the girls; despite this, a part of me always questions if we could have done anything differently in those moments of terror.”Liddle said she felt her experience had been diminished during the police investigation as she was treated as a witness rather than a victim.She said: “Whilst I will always consider other people’s experiences and feelings that day above my own, this labelling made me feel like my own experience was immaterial, trivial or even worthless.”The inquiry continues.Explore more on these topicsSouthport attackMerseysidePoliceEnglandNorth of EnglandCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

It had become increasingly difficult to “achieve the level of growth needed to reach a profitable position”, she said in a statement. Her final collection will go on sale online and in her two London shops at the end of the month.Cefinn, which is an amalgamation of their children’s names, launched in autumn 2016, three months after David resigned over the Brexit vote. Formerly the creative director of the British brand Smythson, Cameron took a pattern-cutting course while her husband was planning the EU referendum. Against all odds – and public sentiment – it started well.View image in fullscreenA photo issued by Cefinn of Samantha Cameron at around the time of the brand’s launch.Photograph: Cefinn/PASelf-funded and with just 40 looks, which ran up to £400 for a coat, the brand hard-launched with a handful of pieces – sleeveless A-lined culottes, trouser suits in bright colours and a flattering tie-waist dress in her trademark windowpane print – in Vogue’s December issue.It helped that her sister, Emily Sheffield, was then the magazine’s deputy editor, her cousin is the interior designer Cath Kidston and her mother, Annabel Astor, co-founded the interiors company Oka. But equally, its “C-suite chic” filled a hole in the market, according to Joy Montgomery, Vogue’s online commerce editor. “It understood that so many women just wanted easy-to-style, flattering staples that weren’t tethered to the changing tides of the seasonal trend cycle,” she said.Cameron said the idea had been to create trend-free clothing for women who moved between roles, in fabrics that didn’t need to be dry-cleaned. One of the few brands with a designer who was as much a visual ambassador of the clothes as anyone who wore then, Cefinn became inextricably linked with Cameron’s own style. Her collarbone-to-calf printed dresses looked as at home in the Cotswolds as the courtroom, and were worn by the Princess of Wales and Akshata Murty.Among the bestsellers was the whimsically named Rosie dress, whose button-down front is sewn shut so as to avoid a gaping bust.In 2020 she successfully launched knitwear. One item, a £150 tabard, even had a waiting list. She went on to model the pieces on social media, twirling desk-side in her white-walled office.Yet in some ways, the latest news isn’t surprising. Despite its glossy start, 18 months into the business, in 2018, Cefinn lost more than £500,000. Later that year, it secured £2.5m from fundraisers including the Tory peer and party donor David Brownlow, who became company director andbankrolled the Johnsons’ Downing Street makeover. But by 2020, thanks in part to Covid, losses were mounting, and by 2021 it had suffered its fourth consecutive annual loss.View image in fullscreenA model wearing a Cefinn dress.Photograph: PR Image/CefinnIn 2022 revenues hit £3.8m, but the company went through various supply-chain problems after the UK agreed its post-Brexit EU trade deal – some of which she diplomatically outlined in a Radio 4 interview as “teething issues” – as well as escalating costs and theremoval of tax-free shopping for tourists. Compounded by unforeseen international trading restrictions, the market simply conspired against it.Cefinn’s story is a familiar one for several independent British labels whose outlook has been hit by the whims of the fashion industry, among them The Vampire’s Wife and Roksanda, which were particularly affected by thecollapse in Marchof the online stockist Matchesfashion.“Ultimately, it came up against the same challenge that has confronted every high-street and mid-priced brand in recent years,” Montgomery said. “How to stand out in an increasingly crowded marketplace in which content is king and customer loyalty is an ever-shifting target.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With just over 80,000 followers on social media, Cefinn’s online presence was relatively low-key.According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, customers in Cefinn’s 45-54 age bracket have the highest disposable income. But the safe formula that made Cefinn appealing “doesn’t stand a chance when John Lewis and M&S costs half the price”, Shuttleworth said. This week, John Lewis’ own-brand knitwear sales were up more than 50% week-on-week. Among its most popular offerings?Sleeveless tabard vests.Those with bigger budgets have moved on to brands such as Rixo, whose vintage-inspired dresses have cross-generational appeal, and ME+EM, which, in an ironic twist, has been worn by Cameron’s Labour counterpart, Victoria Starmer, and Angela Rayner and opened in the US.“It’s notable that [British] high-street brands have been expanding their higher-priced offering,” Montgomery said ofthe newly normal four-figure coat.It’s possible that it became too difficult to separate the designer from her personal history. Cameron is, after all, still married to the man who – among many things – left office after losing the Brexit vote and has remained a broadly disliked public figure.There is no overt branding on the clothes, but some looks are recognisably Cefinn. Shuttleworth disagrees that anti-Tory sentiment extends to sales: “I think if the product is right, that doesn’t matter,” she said.Yet one customer, who preferred to stay off the record, told the Guardian she simply couldn’t wear her navy Cefinn dress to work “in case someone asked her where it was from”.Explore more on these topicsFashionSamantha CameronnewsShareReuse this content"

But a permanently exhausted cockpit crew is a significant risk.”She said staff shortages and “rising operational pressure” had worsened the situation for pilots, particularly during the summer months.The union said it defined napping as “controlled rest phases during the flight phase”.Explore more on these topicsAir transportGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It had been expected to employ about 800 people overall, including 180 scientists.As part of its U-turn, Merck, known as MSD in Europe, will vacate laboratories at the nearby London Bioscience Innovation Centre, which hosts more than 60 life science companies, and the neighbouring Francis Crick Institute by the end of 2025, with the loss of about 125 scientific jobs.The New Jersey-based company said it would move the research operations to other sites. It is unclear where in the world it would be, but pharmaceutical companies are under pressure from Donald Trump to invest more in the US. The company declined to provider further details.In a statement, MSD announced “plans to discontinue discovery research operations in the UK and that it no longer plans to occupy the Belgrove House site at King’s Cross”.“This … reflects the challenges of the UK not making meaningful progress towards addressing the lack of investment in the life science industry and the overall undervaluation of innovative medicines and vaccines by successive UK governments,” it said.MSD had previously said the research centre would build on the company’s 100-year heritage in the UK, close to London’s Knowledge Quarter and its Moorgate headquarters. It will keep its HQ and a large animal health site in Milton Keynes.Lengthy negotiations between the government and the industry over the cost of medicines for the UK broke down last month. Under the voluntary pricing and access scheme, companies agree to pay back a certain amount of revenue they make from newer, branded drugs. In 2023, the rebate rate rose to 23.5%, which compares with 5.7% in France and 7% in Germany.Richard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said: “This is a real blow to the UK’s life sciences ambitions. No one wants to hear that successful and innovative companies like MSD are reducing their investment and footprint in the UK.”Referring to a recent survey from Deloitte, and the UK’s trade deal with the US, a government spokesperson said: “The UK has become the most attractive place to invest in the world, but we know there is more work to do. Through our life sciences sector plan, we’re taking decisive action to further unlock innovation, drive investment and boost growth.”The news came as a report showed that the UK had lost ground to rivals in the global race for pharmaceutical investment and research.Investment in life sciences research and development (R&D) in the UK has underperformed against global trends since 2018, according tothe studyfrom the ABPI and the consulting firm PwC.It said a significant slowdown began in 2020, when the rate of growth in R&D investment fell to 1.9% annually, down from 6.3% in the three preceding years and lagging behind the global average of 6.6%. R&D investment by the pharmaceutical industry even fell in 2023, the final year of the study, by nearly £100m.At £795m, investment by foreign life sciences companies in the UK was 58% lower in 2023 than in 2017, when it stood at £1.9bn. This meant that the country declined in global rankings from second place in 2017 and 2021 to seventh place in 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It ranked eighth for late-stage industry trials in 2023, down from fourth in 2017, although there were “small signs of improvement” in 2023, according to the report.Rippon Ubhi, who runs Sanofi’s UK and Ireland business and the French company’s speciality care division, said: “The findings in this report paint a concerning picture for UK patients and our economy.“The UK is increasingly being viewed as ‘uninvestable’ in global boardrooms due to unprecedented [NHS]clawback ratesand restrictive patient access to medicines. While other countries are actively investing in innovative medicines for patients, the UK is falling behind.”The UK head of the Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis, Johan Kahlström, has also said high costs meansthe UK is “largely uninvestable,”, while the health secretary, Wes Streeting, has pledged that he will not allow firms to “rip off” taxpayers.The government has set a target to position the UK as the leading life sciences economy in Europe by 2030 and third globally by 2035, while the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said the UK is at theforefrontof developments in the sector.Torbett said: “The UK has a world-class science base and the potential to lead globally in developing the next generation of medicines and vaccines. But without a more competitive environment for investment, we risk losing out to other countries making bold moves to attract internationally mobile investment.”Only 37% of new medicines are made fully available for their licensed indications in the UK, compared with 90% in Germany. ABPI data shows that more than 60 medicines did not launch in the UK or were delayed between 2019-20 and 2022-23.Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryHealthResearch and developmentScience policyInvestingFinancial sectornewsShareReuse this content"

There were no fires near their home in British Columbia,Canada. Her air quality app showed low levels of pollution. She could not smell any smoke.Carter, a music-loving Lego enthusiast who had asthma, brought along his smiling shark tooth-patterned emergency kit that held an inhaler, allergy pill and EpiPen. When smoke did roll in from the north, Vigh took him indoors.But at home that evening, Carter began to cough uncontrollably. Vigh and her husband, James, followed the doctors’ checklist – emergency inhaler, drink of water, steroid inhaler – and gave him a bath to cool down. Then, “all of a sudden, he started coughing again like crazy”, said Vigh.View image in fullscreenA resident sprays water on hotspots near a house during a wildfire in Celista, British Columbia, Canada, on 19 August 2023.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesAlarmed, she drove Carter to the local hospital and called ahead so medics would be waiting. “This isn’t good,” Carter told his dad while being carried to the truck.“Right then, we both knew this wasn’t just a normal asthma attack,” said Vigh, a teaching assistant. “Never thinking in a million years it was going to result the way that it did.”Carter died in hospital that day from what the coroner called an asthma attack aggravated by wildfire smoke. And though most people in his family’s shoes will not know it, his death was far from the only one made more likely by the fumes.Tiny toxic particles spewed by Canadian wildfires killed 82,000 people in 2023, according to astudy published in Nature on Wednesday. The long tendrils of smoke choked towns not just in Canada and the US, but also across the Atlantic. The pollution was responsible for 22,000 early deaths in Europe alone.The findings add to a growing body of evidence that suggests smoke from wildfires ranks among the greatest threats to human health. In December, astudy in the Lancetmedical journal attributed 1.53 million deaths each year to exposure to air pollution from wildfires.Despite the vast death toll, experts warn of a widespread lack of public awareness and government action. The air quality app that Vigh checked on the day that Carter died had relied on a monitoring station 60 miles (100km) away. It was too far to detect the invisible pollutants cloying the air around their home.View image in fullscreenAmber Vigh, Carter’s mother, right, now helps to distribute air quality monitors to towns in Canada that lack adequate coverage.Photograph: Amber VighVigh has since started an initiative with the BC Lung Foundation in Carter’s memory, distributing free air quality monitors to towns that lack adequate coverage. “His life was taken way too soon, but he’s out there saving lives for other kids and adults.”The wildfires that ravaged Canada in 2023 were the country’s most destructive on record, and pumped out pollutants across the world. They increased annual exposure to dangerous particles known as PM2.5 by 65% in Canada, 21% in the US, and 4% in Europe, according to data from the Nature study. The particles are small enough to pass from the lungs into the bloodstream, irritating everything from the airways to the brain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The plumes of smoke have devastating impacts on the body that often go unattributed.Vigh said she was proud of the work that Carter’s project had achieved – last month, BC Lung Foundation brought air quality monitors to Dawson Creek and next week, she and Carter’s two siblings would bring some to Golden River – and hoped it would spread across Canada.“It’s kind of a love-hate thing,” said Vigh. “I want to make a difference for Carter, but I would give it all back in a heartbeat if I could have him back.”Explore more on these topicsAir pollutionWildfiresPollutionCanadaAsthmaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The story, which Butterfield describes as “a love letter to my working-class childhood”, is set in a city tower block, and finds a young boy, Jeremiah, planting a packet of sunflower seeds in memory of his father. The seeds sprout overnight, taking over the apartment block.The Wainwright prizes, named after the famed author and fell walker Alfred Wainwright, celebrate nature and conservation writing. Each of the two main prizes comes with a £2,500 award.Dalton’s memoir, which was also shortlisted for the Women’s prize for nonfiction, is “a sustained and patient attempt to cross the species abyss, and to see the world through the hare’s eyes,” wrote Edward Posnett in aGuardian review. “It possesses a dream-like quality, and often reads as a fable of metamorphosis.”Both Dalton and Butterfield are debut authors. Butterfield’s Flower Block is “a beautifully told story brought to life by stunning artwork that kept me engaged from start to finish”, said former Blue Peter presenter and judge Mwaka Mudenda. “I loved the rich diversity of characters throughout the book – a reminder of the beauty in our differences and the strength of community.”Dalton and Butterfield were named overall winners out of six category winners, having won the nature writing category and the picture books category respectively. Meanwhile the conservation writing prize was given to The Lie of the Land by Guy Shrubsole, the illustrative books prize was awarded to Feed the Planet by George Steinmetz with Joel K Bourne Jr and Michael Pollan, the children’s fiction prize went to Wildlands by Brogen Murphy, and the children’s nonfiction winner was Think Big: Secrets of Bees by Ben Hoare, illustrated by Nina Chakrabarti. Category winners were awarded £500 each.Along with Mudenda, the category judging chairs were author and bookshop owner Luke Sherlock, biologist and Natural History Museum podcast host Khalil Thirlaway, author and ecologist Lee Schofield, evolutionary biologist and broadcaster Ella Al-Shamahi, and children’s writer Uju Asika.The two overall winners were selected by a panel which included the prize director, Alastair Giles, and subject specialists, drawing on recommendations from the category judging panels. “As environmental and social challenges grow ever more urgent, it’s inspiring to see writers of all ages and backgrounds using their voices to deepen our connection with the natural world,” said Giles.Last year’s main prizeswere won byMichael Malay for Late Light and Foxlight by Katya Balen.

This could be an omen of what’s to come, withDonald Trump’s pro-fossil fuel agenda set to significantly slow down the emissions cuts required to avoid disastrous climate impacts, a new forecast has found.The “most abrupt shift in energy and climate policy in recent memory” that has occurred since Trump re-entered the White House will have profound consequences for the globalclimate crisisby slowing the pace of US emissions cuts by as much as half the rate achieved over the past two decades,the Rhodium Group forecast states.The US is still expected to reduce its planet-heat emissions by between 26% and 35% by 2035 compared with 2005 levels, according to the report. But this is well down from a 38% to 56% reduction by 2035, which Rhodium forecast just last year during Joe Biden’s presidency.None of these scenarios will be sufficient to allow the US, the world’s largest historic emitter of carbon pollution, to play its full part in helping the world avert a worsening climate breakdown coming from 2C (3.6F) or more in global heating.Chart of the projected US emissions under various scenarios falling short of the reduction targets set in the US Paris agreementThe US and other governmentsagreed a decade agoin Paris to avoid this threshold butare badly off-trackin required emissions reductions, ahead ofa key UN climate meeting in Brazil in November to thrash out new targets.Even under the best-case scenario, whereby fossil fuels become much more expensive and cheap renewable energy is swiftly deployed, the US will cut its emissions by just 43% by 2040, Rhodium found – well below Biden’sown pledged target, since jettisoned by Trump.In the worst case, in which clean energy is severely constrained by economic and political factors, US emissions could even tick up slightly at the end of 2030s, the report states.‘There is only one player’: why China is becoming a world leader in green energyRead more“That is very different to where we were before; it’s more than halving the pace of decarbonization we’ve had over the last two decades,” said Ben King, a director at Rhodium.“The US was already off-track in meeting its contribution to emissions cuts and this is now a fairly big step in the wrong direction. The emissions trajectory is now a lot worse because of this policy whiplash.”Under Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda, the federal government has thrown open vast areas of land and waters to drilling and mining,ditchedthe Paris targets and shreddedalmost allregulations that aim to limit greenhouse gas pollution and the emissions ofother air toxins that harm people’s health.Trump has sought to hobble the clean energy sector in the US, signing a Republicanspending billthat kills off incentives for new solar, wind and battery projects and instructing his administration to halt new renewables facilities,even if they were previously approved and nearly completed.“We don’t allow windmills and we don’t want the solar panels,” the presidentsaid recently. Trump, who hasa longstanding animus towards windafter objecting to viewing “ugly” wind turbines from his Scottish golf course, has conversely praised “beautiful clean coal” andencouragedfossil fuel producers to bypass pollution rules.This stance towards renewables, despite the administration demanding more supply to meet growing electricity demand, has already had a tangible impact. Offshore wind farms have been halted, while plans for a battery factory inNorth Carolinahave been canceled and a plant inMichiganhas recently been closed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A preview of this can be seen in the first six months of the year, during which US emissions rose by 1.4% compared with the same period last year,according to Climate Trace.This bump in emissions, aided by a similar rise in Brazil, ensured that global emissions were slightly higher than the first half of 2024, a stark sign of the task ahead for governments in tackling the climate crisis without the leadership of the US, the world’s second largest emitter.“We won’t see the impacts of theTrump administrationin the emissions data for a couple of years, I think,” said King.“But we are already seeing a slowdown in renewables installations and, to be honest, even a flatlining of emissions is a pretty bad indicator of the trajectory we need to be on.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsTrump administrationDonald TrumpPollutionUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

I remember seeing severalwhinchats, a late summer migrant whose presence suggested this was a special place.Now it is even better, thanks to the appearance of a flooded area with muddy edges – perfect for waders as they head south.My wife, Suzanne, and I visited recently, enjoying excellent views of threeruffsfeeding in the shallows. Ruffs do not breed here, but they do pass through on the long journey from their Arctic breeding grounds to their African winter-quarters.It took us a while to notice fourcommon snipe(gallinago gallinago)hidden in the rushes at the water’s edge, each probing the mud for food with that eye-catchingly long bill.The snipe does not travel as far as the ruff, but these birds may have flown across the North Sea to overwinter here on theSomerset Levels. When flushed, they fly with a characteristically rapid, zigzag movement, making them extremely tricky to shoot – hence the term “sniper”. Sadly, in Britain it is still legal to shoot snipe – and their relative the woodcock – despite a recent decline in numbers.As we left, a whinchat flew on to the top of a bramble bush, a timely reminder of my first visit here all those years ago.Explore more on these topicsBirdwatchingBirdwatchBirdsSomersetAnimalsWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rosemary, 79, is allowed to give money and the Conservative party has declared donations in her name between 2001 and 2024. Johnson declared a £10,000 contribution from her during his leadership campaign.When contacted for comment, Wafic Saïd said: “My wife is an independently wealthy woman who has been a strong supporter of the Conservative party her entire life.”He added: “I have not made donations to the Conservative party for at least 25 years, and any suggestion otherwise would be clearly untrue and would be a very serious matter for me, as I always respect the law.”A Conservative party spokesperson said it carried out “proper due diligence” on the donations and added: “We do not comment on purported leaked documents, which may have been obtained or manipulated by hostile states.”The files were obtained byDistributed Denial of Secrets, a US-registered non-profit that archives leaked and hacked documents. DDoS has said it does not know the provenance of the data. The Guardian has seen no evidence that the files have been doctored.Rise to prominenceBorn in Damascus, Wafic came to Britain in the 1960s andran a restaurantin west London. He rose to prominence as a fixer for Saudi royals, playing a role in arms sales from the UK to the kingdom.He gave money – reportedly £300,000 – to the Tories in the 1990s but stopped after scandals over foreign donations led to them being banned. From 2001, theConservativesbegan to declare donations in Rosemary’s name.View image in fullscreenWafic and Rosemary Saïd in 2013.Photograph: Alan Davidson/ShutterstockThe leaked file showing that it was Wafic – rather than Rosemary – who was described as a donor appears in atrove of documentsfrom Boris Johnson’s private office obtained by DDoS and seen by the Guardian.The documents contain logs recorded by civil servants that keep a minute-by-minute record of the prime minister’s activities.The entry identifying Wafic as the donor was made on 12 September 2019, overa month into Johnson’s premiership. It says he and two top aides spent an hour and a half with the Saïds.Although the log entry is not a formal statement of a donor’s identity, other records show Wafic enjoyed the kind of privileged access to a prime minister typically granted to donors, rather than merely a donor’s spouse.Revealed: how Boris Johnson traded PM contacts for global business dealsRead moreIn June 2020, as the Covid pandemic raged, Johnson found half an hour for what the official log records as “political phone calls”, meaning Tory party matters rather than affairs of state. He was joined by Ben Elliot, the fellow Old Etonian whom Johnson had appointed party chair toturbocharge fundraising, on a call to Wafic. It appears to have been followed by a call with a major donor.In March 2021, on a train journey from Stoke-on-Trent to London, Johnson made a quick call to another donor and then phoned Wafic again.Other “political” meetings and phone calls recorded in the logs were between Johnson and Conservative party donors, ministers, staff or advisers.There is no record of Rosemary being on the calls with Wafic and she is not named in the logs – which cover all but two months of Johnson’s time in No 10 – apart from on the Downing Street meeting she attended with Wafic.Wafic said: “At my age, I do not recall these conversations. However, it is entirely possible that he [Johnson] may have called to thank me for my contribution to Covid vaccine research.” In 2020, Waficgave £3m to the University of Oxfordto fund that work.Steve Goodrich, the head of research at Transparency International UK and a former Electoral Commission senior policy adviser, said “credible allegations of rule breaking” should be investigated.“Electoral law is crystal clear that parties and politicians can only accept donations from permissible sources, and recipients must verify the source of funds,” he said.The Conservative party spokesperson said it “only accepts permissible donors as set out in law. Proper due diligence was undertaken to ensure that these donations were permissible and accurately reported. Other individuals can support a political party without being a donor.”Wafic also said he had known Johnson since “long before he became prime minister”.Approached for comment, Johnson did not respond to specific questions about the donations. He likened the Guardian’s coverage of the leaked files to Soviet propaganda.‘True friend and admirer’The files also contain a copy of a letter Wafic wrote to Johnson when he resigned as prime minister. He said it had been “emotional” watching Johnson’s final speech from the dispatch box and he commended him on a “legacy to be proud of”.“I really enjoyed all the meetings we had, whether in person or via Zoom,” Wafic went on. “I hope that now you are free of the burdens of high office, we will be able to see you more often. I also hope that you realise that in me you have a true friend and admirer. Rosemary joins me in sending you and all your family our warmest wishes and fond affection.”Johnson replied: “I am proud of my time in office although there is of course much more I would have liked to achieve given the opportunity. I am grateful for your ongoing support and friendship.” He added: “Please send my best to Rosemary, and I look forward to seeing you soon.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Don’t make my final years a misery.”Senior aides to the king and Harry were pictured together in London in July, an event reported to be an initial step towards opening channels of communication between the two households.Charles will host Donald Trump at Windsor Castle forthe US president’s second state visit next week.Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryKing Charles IIIMonarchyQueen Elizabeth IIShareReuse this content"

He said: “Stop going on social media, invite us to the meeting, let’s have a discussion, because I want to know what is going on in London.”He warned further strikes could follow. Speaking earlier to the BBC, he said: “We’ve got towards the end of a week of strike action, we’re open to negotiations, but there are no invitations to sit down with TfL. We’ll have to see what the next move is.”Dempsey said the RMT wanted to make “meaningful progress” towards its 32-hour week ambition and was prepared to “compromise and discuss” in negotiations.A TfL spokesperson said talks had not taken place as the RMT’s demand for a reduction in the working week had been ruled out as impractical and unaffordable.View image in fullscreenThe ebike providers Lime and Forest reported much-increased usage, with TfL’s Santander scheme also seeing a surge.Photograph: James Veysey/ShutterstockSome of the gridlock seen during pre-Covid tube strikes was averted as commuters worked from home and used the Elizabeth line,opened in 2022. Growing numbers have also turned to bikes to navigate London’s congested roads – and even boats, avoiding the streets.Buses, the Elizabeth line and London Overground have taken on much of the strain, collectively carrying about 1 million extra passengers daily, according to TfL’s contactless data. Overall usage of TfL’s modes has been down about 20% compared with normal numbers, with many people either staying home or cycling.The capital’s ebike providers have been big beneficiaries of the strikes and an invaluable aid on gridlocked roads towards central London.Lime said it had an upsurge of 78% more hires than the previous Wednesday. Forest reported Tuesday morning rush-hour rides at four times normal levels and 20,000 new app downloads on Monday alone.TfL said its Santander cycle scheme also saw a surge with almost 20,000 hires by 3pm, up 93% on the usual figure.Meanwhile, the Uber-branded Thames Clipper boats reported total passenger numbers up 66% on Tuesday compared with a week earlier.Most businesses, however, will be counting the cost. The Centre for Economics and Business Research thinktank estimates the strikes dealt a £230m blow to the economy, excluding indirect effects such as lost productivity and lower retail spending. The Night Time Industries Association claimed the strikes could cost the leisure and entertainment sector £150m.Footfall in some of London’s main work and retail centres had fallen by almost a third, according to O2 mobile phone data. It said footfall across central London on Tuesday lunchtime was down 16% compared with a week earlier, with Canary Wharf down 31% and London Bridge and the City down 21%.TfL has advised passengers to check daily for service updates. A full tube service is not expected until 8am on Friday morning.Explore more on these topicsLondon UndergroundIndustrial actionLondonRMTRail transportCyclingTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

A working group featuring staff from both galleries has also been established.But the Guardian understands that behind the scenes, the decision to change the collection policy at the National Gallery is seen by some as a threat to Tate and a shift that could revive an old rivalry.One person with knowledge of the situation said: “Hats off to [the National Gallery] for getting the money; that type of competition is good. But we have to ensure we do the right thing for the national collection and not something really stupid that’ll have national galleries at each other’s throats because that’s crazy.“I know £400m sounds like a lot of investment, but one Rothko is £150m: if you want a Basquiat, it’s over £100m. I understand that they’re over the moon with this amount of money, but I just think a reality check in favour of the national collection is important.”Another source associated with the Tate said: “If the National Gallery collects, there will be competition for acquisition and much bad blood, as in the 1970s.”However, others involved at Tate welcomed the move. A senior figure, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Guardian: “What the National Gallery wants to do is perfectly understandable – they can’t really just stop right at a certain point as we get further away [from 1900], it starts to become more and more arbitrary.”The source said that the National Gallery collecting 20th-century work would, if anything, have a positive impact on Tate, because it basically has “a lot more money at the moment. They can buy those works and share them with Tate”.Tension existed between Tate and the National Gallery for decades, fuelled by the question of who should be allowed to collect “modern” art. The two institutions used to compete for the same works, with the Tate arguing that the cutoff point for the National Gallery should be 1900. That position was confirmed in an official agreement in 1996, but that line has never sat well with bosses at Trafalgar Square.Successive National Gallery directors have argued that the barrier is arbitrary and awkward, meaning, for example, they can include everything that inspired cubism but not show any of the work because of when it was created.When Gabriele Finaldi became director of the National Gallery in 2016, he spoke about his frustration at the 20th-century cutoff, saying it was “slightly frustrating to reach 1900 and then not go on”.On Tuesday Finaldi said the change in the collection policy was necessary because “as 1900 gets further and further away it will be natural for us to tell the bigger story”.When asked about a possible “war” between the two institutions, Finaldi told the BBC: “We share the responsibility for a very, very large and significant part of the nation’s art. And it’s natural for us to work together.”But any flirtation with modernity at the National Gallery raises hackles in some quarters. In 2005, the gallery was criticised for “selling out” when it installed Chris Ofili as its artist in residence – almost a decade after he won the Turner prize.In 2009,a new agreementbetween Tate and the National Gallery ensured that the 1900 barrier would be respected after the initial 1996 deal ran out. That has held since: Tate Modern has become the destination for international art from 1900, the National Gallery houses international art to 1900, and Tate Britain holds British art from 1500 to the present day.That agreement has not always been followed to the letter. The National Gallery already has more than 40 works made since 1900, with paintings by Picasso and Cézanne in its collection. There is alsoa Richard Long piecefrom 2025 in the Sainsbury Wing and in 2023 it staged an exhibition or work by Paula Rego.Tuesday’s announcement raises questions of where certain 20th-century painters would now sit.A senior Tate figure who spoke to the Guardian used the example of what would happen to the work of David Hockney now the agreement has been torn up. “Do we want David Hockney to leave his works to Tate for use there and across the country or to the National Gallery?” they asked.“We must have an agreement for donors and artists about where they leave their work,” said another source. “Otherwise, it’s just going to be a complete shambles.”In a joint statement, Balshaw, the director of Tate, and Finaldi, the director of the National Gallery, said: “The National Gallery and Tate have established a joint working group and we look forward to fleshing out the details of our new collaboration over the coming months.“Speaking on behalf of both institutions, we see enormous potential in building this close collaborative relationship, which will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the art-loving public.”Explore more on these topicsTate ModernTate BritainArtNational GalleryLondonEnglandHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.”As vice-president, Harris says, she felt caught in an impossible position: unable to counsel Biden against running without appearing self-interested.“And of all the people in the White House, I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out,” she writes. “I knew it would come off to him as incredibly self-serving if I advised him not to run. He would see it as naked ambition, perhaps as poisonous disloyalty, even if my only message was: don’t let the other guy win.”Harris portrays the White House as deferential to Biden’s decision-making, writing: “‘It’s Joe and Jill’s decision.’ We all said that, like a mantra, as if we’d all been hypnotized.”The excerpts reveal Harris’s frustration with what she describes as systematic marginalization within the administration. In one example, she writes that her chief of staff, Lorraine Voles, “constantly had to advocate for my role at events: ‘She’s not going to stand there like a potted plant. Give her two minutes of remarks. Have her introduce the president.’”Harris adds: “When Fox News attacked me on everything from my laugh, to my tone of voice, to whom I’d dated in my 20s, or claimed I was a ‘DEI hire’, the White House rarely pushed back with my actual résumé: two terms elected DA, top cop in the second-largest department of justice in the United States, senator representing one in eight Americans.”Despite the White House having “a huge comms team” and daily press briefings, Harris writes, “getting anything positive said about my work or any defense against untrue attacks was almost impossible”.She recounted watching Biden’s Oval Office speech announcing his withdrawal from the race: “It was almost nine minutes into the 11-minute address before he mentioned me.”Harris does, however, defend Biden’s mental capacity during his presidency, attributing his struggles to age-related fatigue rather than cognitive decline.“Many people want to spin up a narrative of some big conspiracy at the White House to hide Joe Biden’s infirmity. Here is the truth as I lived it,” she writes. “Joe Biden was a smart guy with long experience and deep conviction, able to discharge the duties of president.“On his worst day, he was more deeply knowledgeable, more capable of exercising judgment, and far more compassionate than Donald Trump on his best. But at 81, Joe got tired,” Harris continues. “That’s when his age showed in physical and verbal stumbles.”She suggests Biden’s poor debate performance was linked to his schedule. “I don’t think it’s any surprise that the debate debacle happened right after two back-to-back trips to Europe and a flight to the west coast for a Hollywood fundraiser.”Harris adds: “I don’t believe it was incapacity. If I believed that, I would have said so. As loyal as I am to President Biden, I am more loyal to my country.”The memoir will be published on 23 September, and Harris has announced a book tour spanning 15 cities, including stops in the UK and Canada.Joe and Jill Biden’s office did not respond for a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsKamala HarrisJoe BidenUS elections 2024US politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The research has been hailed as a “leap forward” in the legal battle to hold big oil accountable for the damages being caused by the climate crisis.The research found that the emissions from any one of the 14 biggest companies were by themselves enough to cause more than 50 heatwaves that would otherwise have been virtually impossible. The study shows, in effect, that those emissions caused the heatwaves.The carbon pollution from ExxonMobil’s fossil fuels, for example, made 51 heatwaves at least 10,000 times more likely than in an unheated world, the researchers found, as did the emissions from Saudi Aramco.Global heating is making heatwaves more frequent and more intense across the globe, contributing to at least500,000 heat-related deathsa year. Thesearing heatwavethat struck the Pacific north-west of the US in 2021 was made almost 3C hotter, for example.The new research found that the total emissions from the 180 “carbon major” companies included in the analysis were responsible for about half the increase in intensity, with emissions due to forest destruction making up most of the rest. It also found that the 213 heatwaves studied became 200 times more likely on average from 2010 to 2019 owing to the climate crisis.“Being able to trace back the contribution of these single [carbon major] emitters and quantify their contribution could be very useful for establishing potential liability,” said Prof Sonia Seneviratne, at ETH Zurich university in Switzerland, a senior author of the report.Dr Davide Faranda, a research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and not part of the study team, said: “This study adds a crucial new step: it connects the dots between specific climate disasters and the companies whose emissions made them possible. This bridge could become a cornerstone for legal and policy action to hold polluters accountable.”View image in fullscreenThe heatwave that hit the Pacific Northwest of the US in 2021 (Seattle, pictured) was made almost 3C hotter by global heating, the study found.Photograph: Jason Redmond/ReutersCassidy DiPaola, a spokesperson for the Make Polluters Pay campaign, said: “We can now point to specific heatwaves and say, ‘SaudiAramcodid this. ExxonMobil did this.’ When their emissions alone are triggering heatwaves that wouldn’t have happened otherwise, we’re talking about real people who died, real crops that failed, and real communities that suffered, all because of decisions made in corporate boardrooms.”The world’s highest court, the international court of justice, ruled in July that failing to prevent climate harm couldresult in having to pay compensation, while a German high court set a legal precedent in May thatfossil fuel companies could be held liablefor their contribution. “Here’s the evidence the courts have been waiting for,” said DiPaola. “The bill is coming due, and it’s time these polluters pay for the damage they’ve done.”The research,published in the journal Nature, used a type of analysis called attribution. This compares the hotter world today with the world before mass burning of fossil fuels to assess how emissions have driven up temperatures, using weather data and computer models.The scientists first worked out how much each carbon major’s emissions had pushed up temperatures and then how much these higher temperatures increased the likelihood of heatwaves. Previous research has linkedhundreds of individual eventsto global heating, but this study is the first to systematically analyse a series of events.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The 213 major heatwaves assessed happened from 2000 to 2023 and spanned every continent. The data on them was taken from the biggest disaster database,EM-DAT, but Africa and South America were significantly underrepresented due to lack of reporting and suitable weather data.“The study’s findings likely underestimate the true scale of these events, and the real consequences are probably far greater,” said Dr Friederike Otto, at Imperial College London.View image in fullscreenAramco’s oilfield in Shaybah, Saudi Arabia; fossil fuel companies have a particular responsibility, said the study’s lead author.Photograph: Hamad I Mohammed/ReutersEven the emissions from the fossil fuel companies at the bottom of the list of carbon majors had a significant impact on heatwaves. The carbon pollution from each of these caused 16 heatwaves to become at least 10,000 times more likely than before the climate crisis.“This study is a leap forward that could be used to support future climate lawsuits,” said Dr Karsten Haustein, at the University of Leipzig in Germany, and not part of the study team. “It is also a reminder that denial and anti-science rhetoric will not make climate liability go away.”Carbon emissions are emitted when people use oil, gas or coal to heat their homes or power their transport, but Quilcaille said fossil fuel companies had a particular responsibility – they had pursued profit through disinformation and lobbying, despite having known since the 1980s that burning fossil fuels would lead to global heating.However, no polluter had yet been held accountable in court and challenges remained, said Prof Michael Gerrard and Dr Jessica Wentz, of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.“The problem is the various legal issues that must be resolved before scientists can take the witness stand,” they said in a commentary in Nature. The issues included which courts should hear the cases, whether fossil-fuel producers should be liable for their customers’ emissions, and if long campaigns of deception by some fossil fuel companies were relevant, Gerrard and Wentz said.“The new study is one more building block, and a useful one, but the road to actual liability for the carbon majors is still littered with legal and evidentiary potholes,” they said.ExxonMobil and Saudi Aramco did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsOil and gas companiesFossil fuelsExtreme weatherExxonMobilAramconewsShareReuse this content"

However, research by Digitalt Ansvar (Digital Accountability), a Danish research organisation that promotes responsible digital development, has found evidence of a failure to moderate drug-related language in usernames. It also accused Snapchat of failing to respond adequately to reports of profiles openly selling drugs.Set controls and teach privacy: how to manage your child’s first mobile phoneRead moreResearchers used profiles of 13-year-olds and found a multitude of people selling drugs on Snapchat under usernames featuring keywords such as “coke”, “weed” and “molly”. When researchers reported 40 of these profiles to Snapchat, the company removed only 10 of them. The other 30 reports were rejected, they said.Snapchat said it had “proactively disabled” 75% of the accounts reported and had now disabled all of them.The investigation also found that despite previous criticism, Snapchat’s recommendation systems were spreading and promoting profiles of those selling illegal drugs to users – including to children who had not previously shown an interest in or interacted with drug-dealing profiles.Within a few hours, the researchers’ 13-year-old test profiles had recommendations to add up to 70 suspected drug-dealing profiles because one friend was connected to a drug-dealing profile.Digitalt Ansvar’s CEO, Ask Hesby Holm, said: “As a child or young person, you don’t need to search for these profiles yourself; you can have them recommended directly by Snapchat. That is deeply problematic.“Snapchat itself says they proactively use technology to filter out profiles that sell drugs on the platform. Our investigation shows this is not true. Snapchat hosts an overwhelming number of openly drug-related profiles and appears not to moderate either implicit or explicit drug-related language in usernames.”This failure to moderate profiles with such obvious usernames, he said, meant that “children and young people have very easy access to buying drugs on Snapchat”. He added: “It’s not technology that’s lacking, it is will. Snapchat can easily filter such usernames.”According to Snapchat, in 2023 it had a 90% reach of 13- to 24-year-olds in the Nordics.

Nobody can occupy dreams. Nobody can occupy ideas. Nobody can occupy memory … Nobody can occupy your imagination,” said Masharawi in an interview in London ahead of the film’s release in UK cinemas on 12 September.“We have to be optimistic. We have to tell the people: ‘Tomorrow it’s a better day. Keep dancing, keep creating, keep making films, because it means you have the future.’”View image in fullscreenFilm-maker Rashid Masharawi at the Étonnants Voyageurs festival in Saint-Malo, France, in June.Photograph: Sophie Bassouls/Sygma/Getty ImagesIn a poignant start, we see in Selfie by Reema Mahmoud a woman compose a letter to an unknown friend that by the end is a message in a bottle cast into the sea. In Soft Skin, Khamis Masharawi captures young children learning stop animation to convey the horrors of parents inscribing their limbs with their names should a bomb hit.But there are moments of dark humour too in Hell’s Heaven as the narrator wakes up in a body bag. Only one film, Taxi Wanissa, is left incomplete as director Etimad Washah appears with a testimony partway through: with the death of her brother and his children, she could not continue.In the anthology – which was Palestine’s official entry to the 2025Academy Awards– we see as people forge ahead despite being beset with new, unimaginable realities. And yet with the persistent buzzing of drones overhead, people continue to dance. In a sky that often rains bombardments and less often aid, children still fly kites. The weight of books left behind is measured against that of grief, and the sea is described to us as the only horizon. Drum sets are made from empty food tins, tea is shared, songs are still sung.The films are noticeably devoid of the images of violence and maimed bodies that have poured out of Gaza for nearly two years – which made it “possible for people to watch and deal with” these films, added Masharawi.View image in fullscreenOfferings, one of the shorts in From Ground Zero.Filming months after7 Octoberand into 2024, film-makers became both the storytellers and the story. Thoughts of cinema were difficult to prioritise when refuge, food, loss and trauma took precedence under bombardment. When electricity was cut in the enclave it was impossible to charge equipment, and at times days passed with no communication.The processwas difficult, admitted Masharawi, not just as a Palestinian born in the al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza, but as a human being. It means having to face all that Israel is doing, he said, and with members of his own family killed and homes destroyed, it’s very difficult, he added, to always share personal stories.“I believe in the power of the cinema, the image, the culture, the documentation,” said Masharawi resolutely. “It’s very important because people get used to, with time, slowly, the images they are watching on televisions. It’s the same. They see explosions, they see ambulances, they see martyrs.“This reminds them who they are, these people you are discussing. It’s very important,” he added.If the film serves to remind us of the lives behind the more than 64,000 killed in Gaza, it also reminds us of the attempts made to silence Palestinian voices.In July,Palestinian activist Awdah Hathaleenwas killed by an extremist Jewish settler in the West Bank after working on the filming of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land. The industry itself has seen a shift over time – “very late”, adds Masharawi – as a growing chorus of film professionals callsfor boycottsand signs open letters condemning the worsening humanitarian crisis.From Ground Zero: Stories From Gaza review – scenes of ordinary life in extremisRead more“Some things,” said Masharawi, “if it comes late, it’s better than if they did not come at all.”But the tide of public opinion has held little sway over Masharawi, who since becoming the first Palestinian to show a feature at Cannes with Haifa in 1996, returned to Cannes in 2024 in protest. After organisers expressed their desire to keep politics out of the event, Masharawi staged tents like those in Gaza and screened From Ground Zero.“It’s very important,” he tells me, “to make the films for life, for tomorrow – to make it with hope.”Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

It was finally released last Thursday after many years in development, and everybody is loving it. Hollow Knight was so popular that itcrashed multiple gaming storefronts. With continual game cancellations, expensive failures and layoffs at bigger studios, this is the kind of indie triumph the industry loves to celebrate at the moment. But Silksong hasn’t come out of nowhere, and its success would not be easily reproducible for any other game, indie or not.If you’re wondering what this game actuallyis, then imagine a dark, mostly underground labyrinth of bug nests and abandoned caverns that gradually yields its secrets to a determined player. The art style and sound are minimalist and creepy (though not scary) in a Tim Burton kind of way, the enemy bugs are fierce and hard to defeat, your player character is another bug with a small, sharp needle-like blade. It blends elements of Metroid, Dark Souls and older challenging platform games, and the unique aesthetic andperfectprecision of the controls are what make it stand out from a swarm of similar games. I rinsed the first Hollow Knight and I’m captivated by Silksong. I’ve spent 15 hours on it in three days, and it has made my thumbs hurt.The first Hollow Knight, released in 2017, was a slow-burn surprise hit. It was crowdfunded via Kickstarter in 2014, and Silksong was one of its stretch goals: originally it was supposed to be an expansion for the game, but as the studio’s co-founders, Ari Gibson and William Pellen, told Bloomberg in a recent interview, they were simply having too much fun to stop adding to it. Eventually, over seven years, it became the full-blown 20-plus-hour game that everyone is now enjoying.How could a small team afford to spend all this time on a single game? Well: the first Hollow Knight sold 15m copies. Any developer would dream of working with the resultant resources. Good games do take a long time to make, even when there’s no mismanagement or other development drama getting in the way. Most smaller-scale game developers are constantly seeking funding from investors or publishers who then (understandably) impose timescales far less generous than what Team Cherry has been working with.View image in fullscreenKnight’s tale … Hollow Knight: SilksongPhotograph: Team CherryThe other unique thing about Silksong is the way in which hype has built to a fever pitch over the last several years. The game became so mysterious that it turned into a meme: people have been spamming the chat and the comments of every single game showcase or news event with the words “Where’s Silksong?” for years. Presumably millions of people who never played the first Hollow Knight have been exposed to it in this way. I’ve never seen another indie game achieve this level of notoriety before it was even released. Such was Silksong’s legend that when its release date was announced a few weeks ago several other games were sent scurrying from its wake, delayed by their developers to avoid getting lost in the noise. Pity those games thatweren’tdelayed: asVGC points out, Atari released a similar game on the same day as Silksong (Adventure of Samsara) and it had only 12 concurrent players on Steam.As proven years ago byDuke Nukem Forever, no amount of free publicity could have saved Silksong if it had turned out to be rubbish. Thankfully, it’s excellent. It’s the kind of game whose appeal perhaps isn’t immediately evident; my partner, watching me spend a full hour trying to bounce my character off a series of punishingly placed balloons to ascend a horrible gauntlet of flying things, looked mildly concerned for my wellbeing. (Something in me just won’t let me quit when I come up against sadistically challenging games.) But as millions of players are now simultaneously discovering, it’s exactly the repeated failures that makes the rush of success so invigorating.One more thing about Silksong: spare a thought for the people who, in these moments where it feels like the whole world has been swept up by a game, simply do not enjoy it. Our games correspondent Keith Stuart is one of those unfortunates. “It is rare for me to be completely bewildered by a game’s success, and I know I’m in a tiny minority here, but I don’t get Hollow Knight or Silksong,” he says. “To me, they’re serviceable Metroidvania platformers with a very familiar alien organic aesthetic and tough boss battles. However, the games lack the glitchy, idiosyncratic charm of, say Cave Story or Animal Well, and the luscious visual confidence of, well, Castlevania or Super Metroid. I played Silksong for several hours over the weekend and, although it’s fine – it’sgood– I still felt as if I was being gaslit by the entire industry.”What to playView image in fullscreenCatch ’em all … Pokémon Legends Arceus.Photograph: NintendoGiven that every other game has run screaming from Silksong, there’s not much else to recommend this week – so I’m here with a belated recommendation forPokémon Legends Arceus, a game I slept on when it was released in 2022. This is largely because it was really ropey then, chugging along as you ran around its open fields searching for creatures; its rubbish performance undermined the freedom and possibility the designers clearly intended. But it runs so much better on the Switch 2.Casting you as a Pokémon field researcher rather than a trainer, it has you exploring whole regions full of free-roaming Pokémon, sneaking up on them to throw Pokéballs or hiding in long grass to avoid doing battle with intimidating alpha creatures. The semi-historical setting is a welcome novelty, too – you’re thrown back in time to an Edo-esque period where humans and Pokémon are just learning how they might live together. I have been playing this every evening with my sons, both of them excitedly leafing through their Pokémon encyclopedia books every time we spot a new creature. It satisfies my ageing-millennial draw towards bird-watching and my inner child’s enduring love for Pokémon.Available on:Nintendo Switch/Switch 2Estimated playtime:30-plus hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenThe name’s … 007 First Light.Photograph: IO InteractiveThe first gameplay footage of Hitman developer IO Interactive’s Bond game,007 First Light, debuted last week. There’sa whole half-hour of action, spycraft and (naturally) driving, and it’s looking great. Admittedly, my only connection to Bond is GoldenEye on the N64, but I am intrigued to play a Bond game that has you mingling at parties and digging for information as well as shooting at bad guys and getting into car chases.Earlier this year, an electronics reseller came into possession of atrove of development consoles and cartridgesfrom Sega’s old Basingstoke offices, bought as part of a clearance.

This has sparked a fascinating series of events, as the legal ownership of these pieces of gaming history remains unclear; the electronics reseller, who says he has received no clarification from Sega or the police, suspects that they may already have been destroyed.Take-Two was in talks to rescue the recently cancelled Xbox reboot of spy gamePerfect Dark,reports Bloomberg– but unfortunately Microsoft still cancelled the project and its developer, the Initiative, has been shuttered. Co-developer Crystal Dynamics also had layoffs. Crystal Dynamics has had some terrible luck. After two good Tomb Raider games in 2013 and 2015, it released a middling third one (Shadow of the Tomb Raider) in 2018 and an Avengers game that famously underperformed in 2020. It was then sold to the notorious Embracer Group in 2022, and has struggled to get an original game over the line ever since.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One of those people was readerCordelia, who asks:“How do you feel about using walkthroughs and hints when a game becomes a bit sticky? I’ll be honest, I feel a bit guilty about it.”This is an apt question for this week’s edition becauseHollow Knight: Silksongis really,reallyhard, and giving in and looking up a map or Googling for an answer could be the difference between persevering and giving up on the game. I’m used to playing games without any help: because I’m often playing games for review, thereareno walkthroughs. But I am most certainly not above reading a walkthrough, and I especially appreciate the guide writers out there who’ll give you a nudge in the right direction before just straight-up showing you the answer.Many modern games are communal and collaborative, and sharing experiences and hints is a natural part of that; few people could get through something likeDark Soulsalone, and indeed the game is designed to facilitate cooperation, because it takes the edge off what would otherwise be extreme difficulty. I often look up walkthroughs and guides after I’m done playing a game, too, to see what I might have missed, or whether there’s some secret ending; I didn’t touch a guide while I was playingBlue Princebecause I knew it would spoil my fun, but the second I got to the end I was boning up on all the extra puzzles and content that I definitely wasn’t going to have time to experience.I also look up guides when a game is scary: I’m not ashamed to admit that I played the firstLast of Uswith a text walkthrough so that I knew when fungal zombies were going to jump out at me, and when I could relax. And I also used to rely on guides back when I was a teenager, when I’d import games from Japan but couldn’t read what the hell I was supposed to be doing. Bless the tireless efforts of the GameFAQs authors of the past, who got me through several Japanese PS2 RPGs.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterAction gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And yet this powerful and complex documentary, directed by Brandon Kramer (a distant relative of some of the people involved) and co-produced by Darren Aronofsky, is a reminder that the situation now can’t be understood without remembering the Hamas massacre – how it was calculated to provoke a rage-filled reaction that would discredit Israel internationally, what it meant and continues to mean within Israel and how the political and ideological connotations of the hostages have themselves evolved.At first, the hostages’ images were widely seen as a focus for outrage and a casus belli. Posters put up in cities showing the hostageswere ripped down- to the fury of their families. But now the hostages’ images are associated more with anti-Netanyahu, anti-war-at-all-costs sentiment, with the families demanding real negotiating progress in getting them home.The subject of this film is Liat Beinin Atzili, a teacher, and her artist husband Aviv Atzili who were kidnapped from their kibbutz; Liat was finally to be returned but Aviv murdered. Kramer’s camera captures the heartwrenching agony of Liat’s elderly parents in the US, Yehuda and Chaya, as they wait for news; they are secular-leaning liberals with a “Bernie” bumper sticker on their car. Yehuda is a thoughtful, sensitive man who wishes, even at this moment of agony, to acknowledge the Palestinians’ historical pain, but his grandson Netta, Liat’s son, who escaped capture at the kibbutz, is angrily dismissive of these scruples: “Fuck them, they need to die.”‘It’s so different from the media narrative’: telling a different story of 7 OctoberRead moreThe family travels to the US to put their case to senators and high-ranking officials, but Yehuda is dismayed to see that they are being used to justify hawkish views that he does not share. These inexpressibly painful family disagreements are laid bare, most jarringly with a tearful argument between Yehuda and Chaya. Holding Liat is a valuable work, not least for showing us thatIsraeland Netanyahu are not synonymous.Holding Liat is in UK cinemas from 12 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

The blunt premise is custom built for death and suffering: 50 young American men are selected by lottery for an annual marathon march. If any walker slows to less than three miles per hour, or strays off the road, they are removed from the competition – by being shot in the head at point-blank range. The final survivor wins whatever they want, they’re promised.Why these men would volunteer for a competition with such unfavourable odds we’re left to wonder, as the broader authoritarian society in which the story is set – which looks a lot like 1960s America – is barely seen or explained. It’s clear who we’re rooting for though: Cooper Hoffman’s Ray Garraty, who is dropped off at the starting line by his tearful mother (Judy Greer), then it’s off to the races. Garraty is an all-round decent soul, who befriends and encourages his fellow competitors, particularly Pete, played by British actor David Jonsson (who’s come a long way fromRye Lane). Their growing friendship is the film’s heart, and both actors are innately charming and natural, though both have deeper, darker histories and motivations to reveal.The vibe is initially reminiscent of Stand By Me, another King story about young men bonding on the road: bantering, sharing stories, chatting about nothing and everything. There are some entertaining supporting characters: spiky, bullying Barkovitch (Charlie Plummer) and cocky but vulnerable Olson (Ben Wang) in particular. At its best, the story slots into an easy rhythm, though the camaraderie is destined not to last, as the tiring pack is routinely winnowed down by the accompanying military (led by a cartoonishly shouty commander played by Mark Hamill), and almost every horrific head shot is rendered in full, blood-spurting detail.King wrote this story in 1967, when it doubtless resonated with the random, pointless slaughter and the male comradeship of the Vietnam war. It remains to be seen how it will land in an age of flashier death-game stories such as Squid Game and The Hunger Games (or, for that matter, the imminent remake of King’s The Running Man), although the plight of troubled young men in a fascist society is still very much a live issue, of course.Director Francis Lawrence has form here: he directed several of the Hunger Games movies, but he seems determined to take a different tack here. Unlike the gaudy setting of those films, the only sense of the wider dystopian society we get here, apart from a few brief flashbacks, is the landscape the competitors wander through: an almost deserted, often picturesque rural America that looks like a William Eggleston photo album come to life.It’s mentioned that the walk is being filmed and broadcast, but we don’t really hear about that again. And although some practicalities are addressed (defecation alert!), the human endurance aspect of the exercise is skirted over at times. At one point a walker has a problem with his shoes, for example, and is forced to discard them – a game-changing incident, you might think, but it is never mentioned again. And on they stagger towards the preordained conclusion, straining viewer endurance as much as their own.The result comes across like a cross between a buddy movie and a horror movie – a war movie without the war. Ultimately, it all comes down to the core relationships, so it’s just as well that Hoffman and Jonsson are both terrific; their stars are certain to rise further off the back of this. But it is left to the viewer to fill in the gaps, suppress their niggling questions and just go along with it. Maybe, to mangle a familiar saying, the real treasure is the friends they made along the way, most of whom unfortunately get shot in the head.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Denis, who grew up in several Francophone African countries, has made several movies that inquire into the troubled heart of such places, and now reaches into that well again for her new film, The Fence. In some ways, the film is hallmark Denis, flinty and strange and sometimes inscrutable. But it is also a disappointment, a leaden film whose points Denis has made more convincingly elsewhere.Couture review – Angelina Jolie is the wrong fit for inert fashion dramaRead moreThe Fence is based on a 1979 play by the late Bernard Marie-Koltès called Black Battles with Dogs. It tells the story of three white people living in a protected construction zone in a rural part of an unnamed west African nation. A fatal accident, or something more sinister, has just happened on the work site and the brother of the deceased comes to claim the body. At the same time, the young wife of the site’s foreman has arrived from abroad to stay for a while, rippling the waters of this treacherous, masculine ecosystem. Denis has updated the setting and added some modern geopolitical context, but the theatrical origins of The Fence are felt throughout, to bad effect. This is, perhaps, one play that should have stayed a play.In Denis’s version of events, the foreigners are British and American, rather than French.Matt Dillonplays Horn, who is running the vaguely described construction project until a Chinese concern moves in and takes things over. His lieutenant is a friend from his oil industry days, Cal (Tom Blyth), who is bored and rash and may have done something terrible to a Black worker on the site. A past incident has maimed Horn in a particularly sensitive part of his body, but during his recovery at a London hospital, he met a nurse’s assistant, Leonie (Mia McKenna-Bruce), and the two fell in love. They’ve just gotten married and Leonie is coming to live at the desolate, heavily guarded facility. Further disturbing matters is a local man, Alboury (Isaach de Bankolé), who waits on the other side of the barbed wire fence that surrounds the site, asking for the return of his brother’s remains.It’s a compelling set-up, but Denis does not do nearly enough to distinguish her film from the play. The dialogue is stilted and melodramatic, which forces the actors into the same mode. It’s an odd thrill to see Dillon in a French master’s art film (just as it was to see him as the lead in Lars von Trier’s The House That Jack Built), but he is hampered by the stagey quality of the material. He tries his best to make it all sound natural, but too much of the strain is visible. Blyth, a pouting pretty-boy from the world of The Hunger Games, effectively renders Cal’s deteriorated moral center, but he too is eventually corralled into histrionics. McKenna-Bruce, who burst on to the scene so forcefully in 2023’s How to Have Sex, struggles to make her thin character anything more than a mere plot device. Only De Bankolé seems fully in sync with the film, deftly navigating the poetic lilt of his dialogue.There’s not much of a plot to speak of, as the film is mostly one seemingly unending argument about the handling of a dead body. Larger themes are gestured toward or briefly tangled with, but not in any way that matches the bracing resonance of Denis’s similarly toned 2009 film White Material. The film is, frankly, rather dull. Whatever fires Denis is trying to stoke never catch – not the intended air of dread, not the tingle of sexual transgression, not the creep of old history now demanding to be reckoned with. The Fence is frustratingly opaque and often grating. When some actual fireworks go off, the moment almost plays as a meta joke about the picture’s utter lack of the metaphorical kind.That said, this is still a Denis film, and thus there is some supple, shrewd artistry to appreciate. Denis creates a palpable sense of place, letting us feel the grit of dust and dirt, enveloping us in a darkness teeming with terrible potential. She frequently cuts to the heavily armed men on watch in the facility’s guard towers, their faces barely visible in the night, figures of both protection and potential menace. They are, in some senses, a kind of Greek chorus, observing, and only occasionally commenting on, an unfolding tragedy of grief and villainy and reprisal. Here Denis manages a persuasive idea, a consideration of what it may be to bear witness to a centuries-long parade of rapacious and ruinous outsiders who come scraping across your land. By the film’s grim end, it is woefully clear that they will be standing that doleful vigil for many years to come.The Fence is screening at theToronto film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewClaire DenisMatt DillonDrama filmsToronto film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s inspired by thetrue-life story of Jerry and Joseph Kane, father and son anti-government extremists; Jerry was a self-proclaimed “sovereign citizen” who believed that the government was illegitimate and he could decide which laws to opt out of. He’s played here by Nick Offerman (Ron Swanson in Parks and Recreation), giving a vein-popping, fist-clenchingly believable performance. We see Jerry’s boiling inferno through the eyes of his son Joe (Jacob Tremblay), a quiet, thoughtful teenager urged by his dad to be an independent thinker (so long as he thinks the same as Jerry).It isArkansas, 2010. Sixteen-year-old Joe opens the door to a sheriff handing him an eviction notice; his dad is behind on the mortgage payments. Even when he has the money, Jerry won’t pay the bank on principle. He’s a minor celebrity, a regular on right-wing radio stations, travelling the midwest in a white suit like a cheap preacher giving seminars on how to avoid mortgage foreclosures (a hat gets passed around at the end for donations).The skill of Offerman’s performance is showing Jerry’s charisma – but also the shallowness of it. He’s every bit as desperate as the people he advises, with a terrifying streak of nihilism. Tremblay is equally convincing as poor Joe. When his dad is briefly jailed for traffic violations (he refuses to carry a driver’s licence or insure the car) there is a brief window of opportunity for Joe to escape Jerry’s conspiracies.Slightly less interesting is the parallel drama about an old-school tough police chief (Dennis Quaid) and his newly qualified police officer son (Thomas Mann). We watch the police trainees putting each other in chokeholds – a metaphor for the film’s theme of overbearing dads. Still, this is muscular stuff, with a firm grip on your attention.Sovereign is on digital platforms from 15 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsCrime filmsArkansasNick OffermanreviewsShareReuse this content"

The conductor Franz Welser-Möst barely needed to break a sweat to draw out impeccably polished string sound and top-notch wind and brass solos. No surprises there. But might a few surprises, a few experiments, have made it more memorable?For all the pleasures of these performances, the cumulative effect was of safety and good taste – words not usually applied to Berg’s Lulu Suite, three movements of which began the first concert. The strings and flute sent their tendrils out tenderly and silkily; the blend when the rest joined in was seamless. The intrusion of low brass near the end of the first movement and a moment of barrel-organ brightness in the second briefly ruffled the surface, but you wouldn’t have guessed the anguish of the Lulu story from this.Nor was the finale of Tchaikovsky’s Sixth Symphony the following night as darkly devastating a conclusion as it can be, although the closing bars, the melodic lines sobbing repeatedly over insistently pulsing double basses, did finally pack an emotional punch. This followed a smart, tautly controlled March and a second-movement dance as light-footed as you’d expect from an orchestra with the VPO’s waltz pedigree.Opening the second concert, Welser-Möst made no great statements with his poised, patrician interpretation of Mozart’s Prague Symphony: Mozart’s symphonies almost have novelty value now outside period-instrument orchestras, and performances as straightforward as this perhaps even more so. Tempos were flowing but unhurried, the sonorities in perfect balance, and the wind provided small but noticeable dabs of colour in the finale, without especially standing out.If there was some truly memorable playing it came with another Austrian symphony, Bruckner’s Ninth, which followed the Berg in the first concert. The orchestra immediately found a golden sound that could encompass the length and breadth of Bruckner’s endless phrases in these three movements – the symphony was performed incomplete, as Bruckner left it. Within this sound quality there was still room for quicksilver changes of tone: the end of the first movement, simultaneously jubilant and ominous, set us up for the menacingly mechanical qualities of the second – which temporarily evaporated into skittish violins and chirrupping flute.What was most striking, though, was the all-persuasive sense of direction, stemming partly from Welser-Möst’s notably fluent tempos but also from the quality of the phrasing: the cogs of Bruckner’s music, those endlessly repeated cells and ideas, needed no extra effort to keep turning. Sometimes it feels as though Bruckner only ever wrote slow music, but here the music emerged with a flow as natural as breathing.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

For Austen’s fans in the 19th and 20th centuries, it was the illustrations on the page. We wanted to look at how the illustrations married with the words.”Mills said among the images she was particularly fond of was a 19th-century Thomson pen-and-ink drawing of a scene from Mansfield Park featuring Fanny Price and Edmund Bertram. “It’s just so beautiful and there’s such sentiment there.”Thomson was an Irish artist who had made his name in the 1880s illustrating Elizabeth Gaskell’s Cranford. He went on to become one of the most popular and successful book illustrators of the Victorian era.Mills is also keen on the woodcuts done by Hassall forthe Folio Society’s editions. “They are iconic and constantly being reproduced. Early on, there were a lot of male illustrators but as you move towards the 21st century it’s more female illustrators.”She said she wanted to feature costume sketches for the Jerome play partly because it threw forward to the modern incarnations of Darcy, where he starts to become “portrayed as a heart-throb”.Bringing the show almost bang up to date is the sketchbook Coralie Bickford-Smith used to create a modern iteration:Penguin’s “clothbound classic” version of Sense and Sensibility. “I love what Penguin are doing with Coralie Bickford-Smith, taking motifs from the books and making beautiful covers out of them.

He was the UK’s deputy prime minister from 2010 to 2015, a position from which he was surely pulled in multiple directions as he attempted to bridge the divide between David Cameron’s Conservatives and his own Liberal Democrats. A few years later he chose another challenging role, serving as Meta’s vice-president and then president of global affairs from 2018 until January 2025, where he was responsible for bridging the very different worlds of Silicon Valley and Washington DC (as well as other governments). How to Save the Internet is Clegg’s report on how he handled that Herculean task, along with his ideas for how to make the relationships between tech companies and regulators more cooperative and effective in the future.The main threat that Clegg addresses in the book is not one causedbythe internet; it is the threattothe internet from those who would regulate it. As he puts it: “The real purpose of this book is not to defend myself orMetaor big tech. It is to raise the alarm about what I believe are the truly profound stakes for the future of the internet and for who gets to benefit from these revolutionary new technologies.”But in fact, a great deal of the book is devoted to a defence of Meta and big tech, and that defence begins by conflating the internet (which is widely loved) with social media (a subset of internet activity that evokes more ambivalence). In his discussion of the “techlash” – the sharp turn in public opinion against big tech in the late 2010s – he asks: “Would we choose to turn off certain technologies if we could? Would we deny ourselves the next innovation? Would we be better off without the freedoms of the open internet?”As it happens, I recently conducted a survey with the Harris Poll thatasked questions rather like theseto a nationally representative sample of young American adults – the very generation whose adolescence was grabbed and shaped by a few social media companies. We asked respondents to tell us, for various platforms and products, whether they wished each “was never invented”. The percentage of gen Z who regret the existence of the internet is low – 17%. For smartphones it is just 21%. But for the big social media platforms, regret is much higher, ranging from 34% for Instagram (which is owned by Meta) to 47% for TikTok and 50% for X. In our subsequentsurvey of parents, levels of regret about the existence of social media are higher still.Other researchershave made similar findings.In other words, yes, many of us would choose to turn off certain technologies if we could. Clegg frames the choice as a binary: open internet versus no internet. But the most serious problems are related to social media, which can be regulated without destroying “the internet”, and which is much harder to defend.Yet Clegg attempts to do so. In the first chapter he addresses the twin charges that social media has damaged global democracy and teen mental health. He acknowledges that both declined in the 2010s, but he claims that the declines merely correlate with the rise to dominance of social media, and are not caused by it. He cites academic studies, but his descriptions of them are Meta’s standard talking points, which ignore the manystudieson theother side. In fact, Clegg takes much of his defence word for word froma rebuttal essaythat Meta put out in 2022 in response toone of my essayslaying out the case that social media is harming advanced democracies.Clegg’s claim that the evidence of harm is merely correlational is contradicted by dozens of Meta employees, contractors, whistleblowers, and leaked documentsSo in this book, Clegg gives us Meta’s party line, but on teen mental health he once thought differently. Dozens of US state attorney generals are suing Meta, and the documents they have obtained show us who knew what, and when they knew it. Fromthe brieffiled by the attorney general of New Mexico we learn that on 27 August 2021, Clegg forwarded an email to Mark Zuckerberg from an employee requesting more resources to address teen mental health concerns. Clegg added his own plea at the top, saying that it was “increasingly urgent” to address “concerns about the impact of our products on young people’s mental health”. Clegg noted that the company’s “well-being work is both understaffed and fragmented”. Zuckerberg did not respond to the email.Clegg’s current claim that the evidence of harm is merely correlational, and that the correlations are too small to be taken seriously, is contradicted by dozens ofMeta employees,contractors,whistleblowers, andleakeddocumentsthat showotherwise. To take just one example, in abrieffrom the attorney general of Tennessee we learn about a 2019 study Meta commissioned on teenage mental health. The researchers alerted Meta that “[teens] are hooked despite how it makes them feel … Instagram is addictive, and time-spend on the platform is having a negative impact on mental health”. A bit later: “Instagram is the worst platform for mental health.”Turning to his proposals for how to save the internet, Clegg lays out two pillars: “radical transparency” and collaboration. On transparency, he urges tech companies to be more forthcoming about how their algorithms work and how they make their decisions. He warns: “If the masters of Silicon Valley refuse to open up, the choice will be taken out of their hands.”On collaboration, he calls for a “digital democracies alliance”, because he is concerned, rightly, that China has developed its technologies in ways that shore up its authoritarian system. He wants the democracies of the world to act together so that the internet might live up to the democracy-promoting visions so many of us shared in the 1990s.Would Clegg’s plan work? Transparency is great in theory, but I fear that it may be too late to apply these principles to the powerful companies that now control much of the internet. As tech journalist Kara Swisher memorablysaid in 2019, Zuckerberg and the other founders “built a city without street signs, without sewage, without police, without garbage men. Imagine that city. It’s not a good city to live in, but they collect all the rent on everything.” This is why scammers, sextortionists, drug dealers and political extremists thrive on these platforms and pose dangers to teens and to democracies that the big companies seem unable to fix. More transparency in 2026 may not be enough to repair the terrible urban design laid down 20 years ago.Big tech is picking apart European democracy, but there is a solution: switch off its algorithms | Johnny RyanRead moreAs for collaboration, it’s hard to imagine companies like Meta giving up their data or their sovereignty, especially now that the tech moguls have so much support from the Trump administration, and now that the Trump administration is so willing to apply pressure on other countries. If the masters of Silicon Valley refuse to collaborate, it’s just not clear to me that “the choice will be taken out of their hands”. By whom?The great biologist and ant expert EO Wilson once said about Marxism: “Good ideology. Wrong species.” After reading this, plus several of the many books about Meta’s unethical, careless, “break things” culture, as well as hundreds of pages from the 2021 document leak known as The Facebook Files and from ongoing lawsuits, I suggest we might say something similar about Clegg’s proposals: “Good plan. Wrong industry.”Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist and author of The Anxious Generation (Penguin).How to Save the Internet: The Threat to Global Connection in the Age of AI and Political Conflict by Nick Clegg is published Bodley Head (£25).

She has now delivered a superb second novel that features another fascinating central character, though in a much darker, more disturbing context.A Splintering is the story of Tara, one of five siblings from a poor farming family in the hinterlands of Pakistani Punjab. This is the kind of landscape where age-old codes of manhood, with brother or son as provider and adjudicator of women’s lives, still rule. Tara, gazing at the stars from their courtyard at night, wants to get away from the squalor of Mazinagar (literally, past city), where most people live and die unnoticed, and build a life full of money and possessions in the city. She has no romantic notions about the soporific countryside. “I have no nobility. I come from darkness and filth.”Tara marries an unambitious accountant from the city and quickly absorbs the mores of urban life, but wants more and more every day, for her children and for herself, and finds she is willing to do anything for it.Tara and her belligerent brother Lateef are a compelling duo. Though both strive to rise above their circumstances, the latter receives the unearned privileges of patriarchy. Like Tara, he seeks money, sends his son to private school (although not his daughters), but would have preferred it if his sister didn’t make a living outside the home.The sibling trajectories are sketched in parallel; the man allowed license, the woman forever judged and examined, a twin portrayal masterfully deployed to expose crushing divides of gender and class. Of the two, Tara is the deeper and more complex figure, ultimately tragic, who ends up paying a staggeringly steep price for her pursuit of freedom and desire.Patriarchal modes define everything, even the terms of defiance that women seeking freedom and power must deployThere are passages of strikingirony and insight packed into small scenes, as when Tara needs to teach her daughter, unhappy at having to make do with secondhand textbooks, the virtues of being content with one’s lot. She has just made a life-altering compromise herself for material gain. Fearing violence from her bookish and gentle husband, at one point she says: “Money was the only levee against indignity.”While Tara is the driving force of her story, I was fascinated by her mother, too. She comes to vivid life, her quick and bitter tongue a mirror of all the survivor-victims of patriarchy in south Asia and elsewhere. As someone who has both battled and suffered the men in her life, she’s the conscience of the novel. Escaping the lifelong service of her husband in the village to live in the city with her now wealthy son, who also puts her to use, she encompasses the full scale of what it is to be a woman in old and new Pakistan. Patriarchal modes define everything, even the terms of defiance that women seeking freedom and power must deploy. The scenes involving the two are among the most moving in the novel; the bond between a daughter, willing to do anything for her dreams, and her enabling, worldly-wise mother, is brought alive with psychological intricacy and beauty.The part that doesn’t work so well is Tara’s escape into imaginary films in her head. Though these reveries are perhaps meant as metafictional signifiers of Tara’s desperate urge to write her own story, they take away from, rather than sharpen, what is for the most part a riveting story told by a woman who is both engineer and destroyer of her life. Amna’s prose has fizz and energy perfectly suited to the subject matter: it captures the fetid backwaters of poverty that Tara loathes and the glittering, corrupting city life she wants to own. Major events in Pakistan’s recent history punctuate the narrative unobtrusively, serving as loose scaffolding.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It’s baffling, then, to see this latest game excel in so many areas while failing spectacularly on several of the genre’s most basic tenets.You play an unnamed traveller, the latest of many, sent to gather information about a devastating outbreak that transformed the citizens of a town called New Dawn into the sort of misshapen monsters that have become the staple of sci-fi-adjacent survival horror: contorted of limb, long of fang, and ample of slobber. As you explore the stark, often beautifully devastated aftermath of the outbreak, you search for places where you can travel back through time to when all hell was breaking loose, extracting persons of interest who may shed light on the disaster. A slow-burn story is revealed through the usual assortment of voice notes, missives and grim environmental clues (often, as is de rigueur, daubed in blood on walls).Sadly, this intriguing setup holds promise that Cronos never quite manages to keep, and by the end, through a series of baffling missteps, any sense of claustrophobic foreboding has been largely jettisoned in favour of profound, white-knuckled frustration. It led me to invent several exciting new compound swears to express my fury.View image in fullscreenThe moody blues … Cronos: The New Dawn.Photograph: Bloober TeamSuperb sound design does a hugely effective job of making you aware that there are things out there in the darkness, waiting, hungry. It’s only really when you encounter them that the game’s problems begin. One of the first beasties comes at you in a cramped interior space, and within three hits you’re dead. To defend yourself, all you have is essentially a spud gun and an aiming arm that appears to have strawpedoed six pints of cheap scrumpy, as the reticle sways everywhere. Eventually, you realise how to cheese your way through this skirmish, until you reach the next, where you die. And repeat. Variations of this annoying danse macabre persist throughout the entire 14-hour campaign.This frustration would be assuaged slightly if the game doled out enough ammunition and health-restoring items to make it feel as if you survived the last conflict by the skin of your teeth. But no. You will be sent into battle against a room lousy with monstrosities armed, with one hit’s worth of health, two bullets and no way to remedy the situation. Clear efforts to present a challenge soon start to give off the bloated cadaver-whiff of bad design.None of this is helped by an inventory system that even the most dedicated survival horror enthusiast would call Scroogily stingy, meaning you sometimes have to drop the precious three bullets you have in order to carry a keycard to the next area, or waste time commuting between save points to retrieve things from your stash. This doesn’t create tension. All it creates is busywork.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For the Scottish academic who is granted an audience with Cambodia’s Pol Pot in Jack MacGregor’s play, the first encounter leaves him blandly upbeat. “He seems quite nice,” he tells his friend, a sceptical American journalist.His naivety verges on the comic, but the play is at its most gripping when it takes the opinions of this specialist in economic history seriously. Played by Bobby Bradley, and known only as Stranger, he is the author of In Defence of Kampuchea, a paean to the Khmer Rouge, and is predisposed to see the good in policies such as the centralisation of a money-free economy.Played by David Lee-Jones, and known as Brother, the dictator plays teasing power games with his visitor, taciturn one moment, garrulous the next. Even at his most manipulative in Andrea Ling’s production forA Play, a Pie and a Pint, he is in earnest about his politics. “Cities are poisons for the mind,” may not be a conventional viewpoint but it appears to be honestly held.It is hard to take issue with the journalist, played gutsily by Nicole Cooper, and her horror at a regime that seeks to “divide, dehumanise and destroy”. But the play is at its most interesting when it entertains the possibility of Stranger’s point that capitalist values lead us to dismiss alternative ideologies too readily.When Brother admits to executing his political enemies, Stranger crumbles and the academic’s awakening robs the play of its dramatic tension. You would expect some self-justification, but Stranger’s capitulation is total and the play’s nuance becomes blunted – all Bradley can do is quiver. It turns out genocidal dictators are not so nice after all.AtÒran Mór, Glasgow, until 13 September.

As well as being a choreographer, Requardt is a psychotherapist, and she explained what would have been happening in the woman’s nervous system at the time, the famous “fight, flight or freeze” state (the sympathetic nervous system) versus the “rest and digest” state (parasympathetic). Our ability to cope with these fluctuating states is called the “window of tolerance” and that morning in the cafe, the window didn’t just crack, the glass was blown out completely.Franzmann and Requardt knew straight away this made for the beginnings of a show, and the coffee-shop incident has become the basis for an enjoyable and informative dance-theatre piece,Anatomy of Survival, that the pair have co-created. Alongside a lighthearted psychology lecture, it features the accounts of 23 (fictional) witnesses, who, crucially, all have a completely different take on what happened and who was in the wrong. The text is shot through with jolting cymbal crashes that put the audience into red-alert mode and there are shaking and quaking dances for performers Solène Weinachter, Bea Bidault and Kath Duggan, and, because Requardt’s work is never far from a swerve into the surreal, the unexplained appearance of a large brown bear.View image in fullscreen‘I am yet to meet a person who wants to be really uncontrollably angry’ … Anatomy of Survival.Photograph: Camilla GreenwellThe pair enjoyed digging into research. “One thing therapists really like to do is more training,” says Requardt. “There is just so much to learn about how to deal with the human condition!” Her current training is, appropriately, on nervous system regulation and dysregulation, a trauma-therapy approach called Somatic Experiencing, which involves focusing on internal sensations rather than thoughts in order to modify stress responses. Sounds useful – let’s face it, we’ve probably all had an irrational blow-out from time to time. “Living in a big city, you really see the grind of life,” says Franzmann. “The noise, the bustle, the mess, everyone trying to keep it together financially, practically, maintaining friendships and relationships, emotional pressures, economic pressures … It’s a potential powder keg.”Requardt mentions road rage as a situation where anger can suddenly escalate and take hold, in a way that’s often disproportionate to the situation. Has she ever lost it in a public place? “Yes, I was never great at queueing,” she admits. “Sometimes it is surprising that it doesn’t happen more often,” she says, going into psychotherapist mode. “My question would be: what happens instead? What are we doing when we are ‘behaving’? Are we yielding, suppressing or pushing an experience to one side or are we actually OK?” Requardt suggests that instead of “taming our experiences”, it’s healthier to engage in a relationship with our emotional responses, and “increase our ability to be with intensity”. Easier said than done, you might be thinking.One of the key takeaways from the show is the way every witness sees the situation differently. Was the customer provoked, or was she just “crazy”? Was she asking for trouble or did the server deliberately misunderstand her? “One of my interests is the question of what reality actually is,” says Requardt, “and that it’s experienced vastly differently by people.” Our perception of whether another person is harmless or to be feared, or if a situation is benign or dangerous, can be dictated by how switched-on our sympathetic nervous system has got used to being.‘We spent a week on the cow birth!’ The eye-opening play about animals with sound effects instead of wordsRead moreWe assume our own view of the world is the “real” reality. “It can feel unsettling to allow the idea that someone else’s take is just as true,” says Requardt. Sometimes we might need to allow “the tight version of our own take on reality to loosen enough to let in someone else’s deeply felt reality,” she suggests. “There is always a reason why someone’s behaviour escalates,” Requardt says. “I am yet to meet a person who wants to be really uncontrollably angry.” Not that we shouldn’t be held accountable for our actions, she quickly adds, but if for any reason we didn’t grow up feeling completely safe and secure in our environment and relationships, that can have a huge impact on our ability to ride out stress.“For me,” says Requardt, “it’s important to understand that if you happen to be an incredibly regulated person who can handle all that life throws at you and stay calm in a crisis, then you got really lucky.”Anatomy of Survival is atShoreditch Town Hall, London, 11-12 September and atthe Place, London, 23-24 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreDancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was also one of the earliest Soviet composers of his generation to make a mark in the west.HisFirst Concerto for Orchestra(1963) was taken up by George Balanchine, which prompted Leonard Bernstein to commission the succinct Second Concerto for Orchestra (The Chimes, 1968) for the New York Philharmonic. The Third Concerto (Old Music for Russian Provincial Circuses, 1988) was written for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra andLorin Maazel; the Fourth Concerto (Round Dances, 1989) was premiered by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra; and the Fifth (Four Russian Songs, 1998) was a BBC Proms commission. The last twowere first recordedby the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra underKirill Karabits.Initially Shchedrin’s artistic reputation depended on his ballets for the Bolshoi theatre, Moscow, starring his wife,Maya Plisetskaya, one of the greatest dancers of the age; they married in 1958. His deft arrangement of Bizet –Carmen Suite(1967), highly successful with concert audiences – was followed by balletic reimaginings of literary classics includingAnna Karenina(1972), after Tolstoy, and The Seagull (1979) and The Lady With a Lapdog (1985), both after Chekhov.From his youth, Shchedrin was passionate about the theatre, fascinated by what he described as “the sweet and fascinating poison you feel when you go backstage”. His early opera Not Love Alone (1961) held the Soviet stage for several decades and, as with ballet, he enjoyed composing operas drawn from Russian texts including Dead Souls (1976, after Gogol), Lolita (1992, after Nabokov, a commission fromMstislav Rostropovich), and his “choral opera” based on the writings of the 17th-century mystic Avvakum, Boyarina Morozova (2006). This is an austere essay in the neo-primitivism favoured by Russian composers from Stravinsky, Prokofiev and Shostakovich to the present day.View image in fullscreenShchedrin wrote the scores for ballets performed at the Bolshoi by his wife, Maya Plisetskaya.Photograph: Album/AlamyThe range of Shchedrin’s non-theatrical music is equally varied, from his 1969 oratorio Lenin Lives in the Heart of the People (which does what it says on the tin) to perhaps one of his strangest and most perplexingly “avant-garde” pieces, Musical Offering (1983), a vast and bleakly dissonant homage to Bach for organ, three flutes, three bassoons and three trombones, which he later softened and “shortened” to a mere two and a quarter hours. His orchestral works – the concertos for orchestra, for solo instruments and three numbered symphonies among many others – are equally unpredictable.His Second Symphony (1965), for instance, consists of a sequence of 25 interlocking orchestral preludes. In 1974 he famously gave the premiere of his Third Piano Conerto in a concert in which he also played the First and Second, and went on to write three more.A glutinously sinister set of orchestral variations is titled Self-Portrait (1984). There are jazz-influenced moments in Shchedrin’s earlier scores, and some of his later music for chamber ensemble shows him toying with influences from American minimalism.In public encounters he could be provocative and teasing. Of one of his pieces, he said: “I wanted to capture the sensation of bathing in cold water on a hot day. And the feeling of the water on one’s skin!”When Rostropovich invited him to compose a concerto, the great cellist was astonished when he opened the score: “But the solo part is all harmonics! It’s all quiet!” Shchedrin’s music suggests a complex and deceptive figure: a shapeshifter, perhaps, and not always a reassuring one.Born in Moscow , Rodion was the son of Concordia, a financial administrator at the Bolshoi, and Konstantin Shchedrin, a composer and musical theory teacher. A chorister as a boy, Rodion went to the Moscow Conservatory to study composition with Yuri Shaporin and piano with Yakov Flier.He also attended postgraduate classes by Shostakovich, who showed his students music – especially by Stravinsky – that was otherwise not available or accessible in those restricted days. When a BBC interviewer asked Shchedrin about the effect on composers of Khrushchev’s cultural thaw in the late 1950s, he replied: “In those days every new name we heard –Stockhausen,Boulez,Xenakis– flashed like lightning in a storm!” Subsequently, he himself taught at the Conservatory.Early on he found his way into film, where he worked with the director Aleksandr Zarkhi, and at the Bolshoi theatre his ballet The Little Humpbacked Horse (1955) made a strong impression. Almost immediately after he married Plisetskaya, seven years older than he was and already world-famous, they became the golden couple of the Bolshoi, living in later years in an apartment of great splendour in the centre of Moscow, filled with artworks and memories of Plisetskaya’s glorious career.In 1968 Shchedrin declined to sign an open letter supporting the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Soviet troops, and he was not a Communist party member. Nonetheless, in 1973 he succeeded Shostakovich as chair of the Composers’ Union of the Russian Federation, and for more than a decade wielded considerable influence, at times to the noticeable discomfort of his senior colleagueTikhon Khrennikov, first secretary of the Composers’ Union of the USSR, the overall organisation.Even before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Shchedrin and Plisetskaya spent more and more time abroad, later taking Lithuanian and Spanish citizenship, and living for the most part in Munich.Plisetskaya died in 2015.Rodion Konstantinovich Shchedrin, composer and pianist, born 16 December 1932; died 29 August 2025Explore more on these topicsClassical musicOperaBalletRussiaobituariesShareReuse this content"

It was very funny.Miuccia [Prada]and I talk about it a lot, and I say to her: ‘Well, it was really good for you.’”The film, Wintour added, “had a lot of humour to it. It had a lot of wit.

The solo female artists on the list tend to the iconoclastic: Irish pop star CMAT’s acclaimed third albumEuro-Country, Leeds jazz musicianEmma-Jean Thackray’s Weirdo, FKA twigs’Eusexuaand PinkPantheress’s mixtapeFancy That. As for bands, as well as Pulp, the Irish band Fontaines DC (Romance) and London four-piece Wolf Alice (The Clearing) appear.There is just one rap album on the list, Afrikan Alien by Pa Salieu. As ever, the Mercury seems unafraid of its reputation for nominating just one “token” jazz album, in Webb’s Hamstrings and Hurricanes. Metal, as usual, does not feature.Dr Jo Twist, CEO of the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), the body behind the awards, told the Guardian that she was delighted by the breadth of albums nominated. “It’s a real celebration of such an eclectic mix of achievements across all kinds of genres, and it’s been a really competitive year.”There are several repeat nominations: CMAT was previously recognised for her second album, 2023’s Crazymad, for Me; FKA twigs for her 2014 debut LP1;Fontaines DCfor their 2019 debut Dogrel; Sam Fender for his second album, 2021’s Seventeen Going Under.BothWolf Aliceand Pulp have three prior nominations and one win apiece under their respective belts: Pulp were nominated for 1994’s His ’n’ Hers (controversially losing to M People), won in 1996 for Different Class, and were nominated again in 1998 for This Is Hardcore. Wolf Alice were nominated for their 2015 debut My Love Is Cool, won in 2018 for Visions of a Life, and were nominated again in 2021 for Blue Weekend. They are now four-time nominees, only bested by Radiohead and Arctic Monkeys, with five apiece.View image in fullscreenFour-time Mercury nominees Wolf Alice.Photograph: Rachel Fleminger HudsonAny album released by a British or Irish act between 14 July 2024 and 29 August 2025 was eligible for consideration.

Twist called it a “very successful year”, albeit artists said they missed the live performance aspect of the ceremony. “One of the unique things is having your peers listening and critiquing your performance, talking about your bodies of work, and it was incredible to see those conversations happening in such an intimate environment last year.”This year sees the ceremony move from London to Newcastle – following in the footsteps of the Mobo awards earlier this year – marking a new partnership with Newcastle city council and the North East combined authority. It will take place at Newcastle’s Utilita arena on 16 October, aticketed eventfeaturing performances from many of the shortlisted artists. Former host Lauren Laverne, a Sunderland native, will return to present.View image in fullscreenNorth Shields nominee Sam Fender.Photograph: Kieran Frost/Redferns“The move to Newcastle is very exciting for us,” said Twist. “It’s a city that has an amazing musical heritage and musical culture. What makes British music so brilliant is its diversity. It’s from all over the country but opportunity isn’t necessarily [distributed] all over the country.”In the week running up to the ceremony, a newMercury Fringeevent, in association with local music development organisation Generator, will showcase talent from the north east with live gigs curated alongside local promoters, as well as providing workshops, roundtables and what organisers have billed as a “major industry conference”, with details to be revealed soon.When the Mobo awards took place in Newcastle in February, it delivered an estimated £1.3m into the local economy, and Sam Fender’s three-night run of homecoming concerts at the city’s St James’ Park added a £16.5m boost, local business groups claimed. “This is what opportunity looks like when you’re leaving a legacy, you’re investing and you’re getting people excited about opportunities across the music industry that they might not have access to ordinarily,” said Twist.Whether the prize would maintain a permanent home in the city is “something we will look at”, she said. “If there are other cities who are keen to follow this blueprint, which the Mobos successfully laid down, we’d love to have those conversations again. This shortlist shows the breadth of talent from across the country and all of our nations.”David Byrne, Little Simz, Jasmine.4.t and more: the best music of autumn 2025Read moreThe judges for this year’s prize are broadcaster and writer Danielle Perry, musician Jamie Cullum, broadcaster and DJ Jamz Supernova, BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music head of music Jeff Smith – also the chair of the team – music programming consultant Lea Stonhill, broadcaster Mistajam, Kerrang! creative director and Mojo contributing editor Phil Alexander, BBC Radio 1 DJ Sian Eleri, the Times music critic Will Hodgkinson and music writer Sophie Williams.Last year’s winners were Leeds band English Teacher, the first winners from outside of London since Scottish hip-hop trio Young Fathers a decade prior, who beat the likes of Charli xcx and Beth Gibbons to the prize.The Mercury prize nominees in fullView image in fullscreenPa Salieu.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianCMAT – Euro-CountryEmma-Jean Thackray – WeirdoFKA twigs – EusexuaFontaines DC – RomanceJacob Alon – In LimerenceJoe Webb – Hamstrings and HurricanesMartin Carthy – Transform Me Then Into a FishPa Salieu – Afrikan AlienPinkPantheress – Fancy ThatPulp – MoreSam Fender – People WatchingWolf Alice – The ClearingExplore more on these topicsMusicMercury prizePop and rockPulpCMATFKA twigsFontaines DCnewsShareReuse this content"

Amber’s aim was to capture working-class life in north-east England, and over nearly 30 years I amassed a body of work documenting life in the upper Durham Dales – a project I later called People of the Hills. In 1994, I moved with my young family into a derelict plumber’s workshop and yard in Stanhope, Weardale. Living there over the next six years meant I met people in all kinds of circumstances – I got to know and photograph many local owners of smallholdings because my kids befriended theirs at school.The members of the Stanhope Silver Band, seen in this photograph, were well known in the village. One was a joiner who paid us five quid a month to use our outbuildings as workshop space. I don’t know how many of those in the picture are still in the band – a fair few, I’ll bet.Every second weekend in September, there’s an agricultural show in Stanhope which takes place on the south side of the River Wear – the village is largely on the north side. The band always meet in the village marketplace and then walk to the show via Stanhope Ford, where they cross the river over a series of stepping stones.It was the early days of my colour photography career and the band all wore bright red jumpersIn 1996 I was still in the early days of my colour photography career. The band all wore bright red jumpers, and the river could turn bluer on a sunny day. In September, there’s still plenty of foliage in Weardale too, so it seemed a good opportunity to get something that would use the colour medium to its fullest.I realised it could be an interesting shot for me, because I’m usually up close to people. I have a background in sociology, so there was always an element of “participant observation” in my work. The Silver Band image was a rare example of being able to concentrate on every small detail. This was truly a visual play, unfolding before me on an open air stage.The stepping stones were always a fun challenge with my kids and their friends. You can see on the picture that there’s only room for one person on each stone, and at least a foot between them. When you’ve got more than 20 members of a band, it’s a very delicate operation to get across. It’s a bit like ducklings following their mother.By the time I took this, I’d photographed the band in other situations and when they saw me standing in the middle of the river, I think they just thought: “Here he goes again.” I’d visited the spot a day or two before to find the best place to stand – there were some spots where the river was maybe a foot deep but others where the water would definitely have gone over the top of my welly boots. I was looking west and it was morning, so the stones were nicely lit.You can look at each individual and see whether they’re looking back, looking forward, waiting or stretching across to the next stone. So the picture also has a kind of celebratory feel, which was always a part of Amber’s philosophy – to celebrate working-class culture.Richard Grassick’s Stanhope Silver Band is available inSide’s 50x50 charity print sale.

Keeping the holiday spirit alive by sitting at your desk in sandals feeling sorry for yourself will only prolong the agony. It is much better to rip the plaster off quickly and start dressing properly again.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In the spirit of which, I would like to run you through a few hemline rules. I love a fashion rule – anything that helps pull an outfit together is fine by me. But if you don’t, then think of them as prompts to guide you by walking you through the best combinations of print, fabric and length. They don’t curtail what you can wear. In fact, they might expand it. By giving you a formula for how to wear each different length of skirt or dress, they might help you find a way of wearing whatever hemline it is that you think doesn’t suit you. We all have one of those, right?If you like a flowery print, a maxidress is the ideal showcase for patterns that need room to breatheThe rules are incredibly simple. First: if you are wearing a miniskirt or dress, the fabric, colour and print can be very simple, because the look is punchy anyway. Second: with a knee-length hem, you need to add some pizzazz via fabric, colour or print – otherwise it looks a bit work-ish and boring. Third: a midi-length skirt needs some cool factor in the fabric, colour or print, because otherwise it looks a bit drippy. And fourth: a maxi hem is the best choice if you favour a dramatic or large-scale print, because big patterns need space to make visual sense.View image in fullscreenPamela Anderson rocks a maxi.Photograph: The Stewart of NY/GC ImagesThese rules clarify so much. They have a lot to do with why many of us have rigid ideas of which length works best for us. We often assume it is because a certain length is flattering, but actually it is just that the fabric, colour or print we are naturally drawn to works better on some lengths than others. So, for example, if your default preference is for a very simple black matt fabric, then it might well be that you prefer an above-the-knee skirt to an on-the-knee skirt because, when you look in the mirror, you can see that the above-the-knee skirt looks better than the longer one. But what these rules flag is that, actually, you would also look great in – say – a knee-length skirt in black leather.Let’s unpack it from the top, with the miniskirt. The motto of the mini is that less is more, and you can apply this principle to the style as well as the length. The mini looks ace when kept straightforward: black for smart, denim for casual. So, if your taste in shade and fabric skews classic, then a shorter skirt – doesn’t have to be bum-skimming, a couple inches above the knee still counts – could be worth experimenting with.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

They look like the easiest to wear, but they are the hardest. This is a sensible length, and you need to add a wink to camera, to keep it from tipping over to boring. If you want a skirt or dress with sequins or fringing, knee-length is the perfect foil for it. An interesting texture (suede, leather), an unusual colour or a kooky, 1960s or 1970s graphic print works really well.Next, midi skirts. A midi is easygoing and undramatic. It is smart, practical and doesn’t scream any particular decade. So it is best worn with a bit of attitude, because otherwise it risks looking feeble. Don’t let yourself fade into the background. A deckchair stripe is good, or a strong texture like crochet or lace. Not a spriggy floral. Do you see what I mean?If you like a big old flowery print, I suggest you lower your hem to the floor. A maxidress like the one in the main image is the ideal showcase for patterns that need room to breathe. Back to school doesn’t have to be boring. But you have to know the rules to play the game.

Meringue shards make a lovely finishing touch to all kinds of desserts, from a rich trifle to an avant-garde pavlova or that timeless classic, the Eton mess. As for the leftover yolk, I have several recipes, includingspaghetti carbonara(also featuringsalt-cured egg yolksthat make a wonderful alternative to parmesan) andbrown banana curd.One-egg meringue shards with an Eton mess of strawberry, black pepper and basilArchitect Renzo Pianois said to have sketched his original idea for the Shard on the back of a restaurant napkin. Similarly, whenever I design a more conceptual dish such as this one, I love to start by drawing it in my sketchbook, to develop an idea of what the dish will look like, and while I was drawing the angular lines of the Shard, it reminded me of a minimalist dessert I’d eaten at the seminalAT restaurant in Paristhat featured grey meringue shards that seemed to me to perfectly emulate the dramatic geometry of that iconic London building.But this dish isn’t just visually appealing. Black pepper, strawberries and basil are an unexpected yet classical combination: there’s herbaceous, sweet and savoury complexity from the basil, freshness from the naturally sweet strawberries and a pop of heat from the super-sweet black pepper meringue that adds an unexpected warmth that is then subdued by the cream. If you’re lucky enough to spot any reduced-price berries in the supermarket, this is a great way to make use of past-their-best strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and even blueberries.Prep20 min(plus resting time)Cook1 hr 30 minServes4For the meringue shards1 egg white37g caster sugar37g icing sugar, sifted¼ tsp cream of tartar(optional)⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepperA small pinch of saltFor the mess200g ripe strawberries, or other berries1 tbsp caster sugar, or to tasteZest and juice of ¼ lemonA few fresh basil leaves220ml clotted cream, or double cream whipped until stiffHeat the oven to 110C (90C fan)/gas ¾, and line a large baking tray with a silicone mat or unbleached baking paper. Crack the egg white into a clean, grease-free bowl or jar. Add the caster sugar, icing sugar, cream of tartar if using, and ground black pepper, then whisk with an electric hand whisk or in a stand mixer on high speed for five to 10 minutes, until the mix forms very firm, glossy peaks.Spoon the meringue on to the lined baking tray, then smooth it out into a thin, even layer. Bake for about an hour and a half, or until the surface is crisp and dry to the touch but hasn’t taken on any colour. Remove and leave to cool completely on the tray, then lift the meringue off the paper and snap it into long, jagged shards.Meanwhile, hull the strawberries and cut them into cubes. Finely slice the basil leaves. Put both in a bowl, add the sugar, lemon zest and juice, and mix gently but thoroughly. Cover and put in the fridge for at least an hour, though overnight would be best.Just before serving, thin the clotted cream with a little of the strawberry juices from the bottom of the bowl, being careful not to overmix it, or it will turn buttery.Spoon a generous dessertspoonful of the cream into the centre of each of four pudding bowls and spread it out gently with the back of the spoon to create a well. Fill the well with a generous spoonful of the macerated strawberries, then arrange some meringue shards on top, allowing them to lean and jut out like miniature crystalline towers, concealing some of the fruit beneath. Serve at once, crushing the meringue into the berries and cream as you eat.Explore more on these topicsDessertWaste notFoodFood wasteEggsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In fruit salads and the famous Penang laksa, the mix of sweet, tangy, salty and acidic is so vibrant and distinctive that, for me, it is almost synonymous with the country of my birth and, more importantly, its incredible range of foods and flavours. Naturally, then, I wanted to recreate that in a cake. The choice of an upside-down cake was obvious when thinking about pineapple, and adding tamarind to the caramel felt an exciting addition to the flaky sea salt we all know and love. I have always been intrigued by the fact that small children, my own included, who seem so sensitive to spice in anything else, love gingerbread cookies, which have such a robust flavour profile and warm spiciness. When my boys were going for a birthday sleepover, I had the idea of translating Nigella Lawson’s chocolate Guinness cake into a ginger version, replacing the stout with ginger beer. It was a very successful experiment – the cake retains all the damp luxury of the original, with a backbite of ginger that engages intriguingly with the chocolate. The children loved it, as did the adults.Chocolate ginger beer cakeThe kind of ginger beer you use will make a difference here, so try a few and see which you like best. Once baked, the flavour of the ginger dissipates somewhat, so err on the side of a ginger beer with a strong presence. I likeFever-Tree.Prep10 minCook1 hr 25 minMakes16 squaresFor the cake250ml ginger beer250g unsalted butter, sliced into about 6 pieces60g unsweetened cocoa powder(preferably Dutch-processed)250g caster sugar130g soured cream2 eggs1tbsp vanilla extract270g plain flour½tsp fine sea salt2tsp bicarbonate of sodaFor the icing250g cream cheese, at room temperature100g icing sugar,sifted100mldoublecream50ml ginger beerFlaked chocolate, to garnishGrease and line a 20cm square or round cake tin with baking paper, and heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Combine the ginger beer and butter in a large, wide saucepan large enough for the whole cake to be mixed in, so about three-litre capacity. Set it over a medium heat and stir gently until the butter melts. Off the heat, sift in the cocoa powder and sugar, whisk to combine, then leave to cool for five minutes.Meanwhile, whisk the soured cream, eggs and vanilla in a jug, then pour into the ginger beer mix and whisk gently. Sift the flour, salt and bicarbonate of soda into the batter and whisk gently until smooth and combined. Pour the batter into the lined tin and bake for about 55 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Remove, leave to cool for 10 minutes, then remove from the tin and transfer to a rack to cool completely.Meanwhile, put the cream cheese in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-low until smooth. Turn down the speed to low, add the icing sugar and beat for about 30 seconds, until incorporated. Add the cream and ginger beer, turn up the speed to medium and beat for one to two minutes, until thick and smooth. Refrigerate until needed.To serve, use a spatula to spread the icing thickly over the cake. Scatter the flaked chocolate over the top, then serve. The un-iced cake will keep for about two days, but, once iced, it’s best to eat on the same day.Pineapple pudding cake with salted tamarind caramelView image in fullscreenTamarind concentrate comes in differentforms, from thick and dense to thin and watery. For this cake, choose a Thai liquid tamarind concentrate – it is milder, sweeter and smoother in texture than the Indian style, which tends to be strongly tangy, earthy and chunkier, and more suitable for curries and chutneys.Prep10 minCook1 hr 30 minCool30 minServes6-81 small pineapple(about 1kg)For the caramel50g unsalted butter100g soft dark brown sugar60g Thai liquid tamarind concentrate½tsp flaky sea saltFor the batter160g plain flour2tsp baking powder½tsp fine sea salt50g room-temperature unsalted butter150g caster sugarFinely grated zest of 2 limes1½tsp fennel seeds, lightly toasted, then finely ground (optional)1 large egg, plus 1 large egg white, both at room temperature1tsp vanilla extract120mldoublecream, plus extra to serveLine the base and sides of a 5cm-deep and 20cm-round solid cake tin with baking paper. Cut the top and bottom off the pineapple, then stand it on one end. Following the contours of the pineapple, remove the peel by slicing it off, from top to bottom, then quarter the pineapple lengthways. Cut away the hard central core and remove the black “eyes” by slicing deep V-cuts on either side of them. You should now have four long pieces, weighing about 600g in total. Cut each piece from the short side into small, thin, fan-shaped pieces (about 5mm) and put them in a bowl. Set aside while you prepare the caramel.For the caramel, combine the 50g butter and brown sugar in a small saucepan on a medium heat and stir until both have melted and the mixture just begins to simmer. Stir in the tamarind, then bring back to a simmer, take off the heat and stir in the salt. Carefully scrape the caramel into the lined tin, then arrange the pineapple slices on top, overlapping them so there are no gaps. When the base is covered, overlap a second layer of pineapple on top, then set aside.Heat the oven to 195C (175C fan)/380F/gas 5½. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a small bowl.Put the butter, sugar, lime zest and fennel seeds (if using) in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-high for two minutes. The mixture will be somewhat lighter, but not exactly fluffy at this stage, because of the relatively small amount of butter.Add the egg, egg white and vanilla, and beat on medium speed for about a minute, until fully combined. Turn down the speed to low, add a third of the dry sifted ingredients and half the cream, then mix for a few seconds to combine. Repeat with another third of the flour and the remaining cream. Finally, incorporate the last of the flour and mix on low speed until smooth.Scrape the batter carefully on top of the pineapple and smooth with a small spatula to form an even top. Bake for about 50 minutes, until the cake is lightly golden on top and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.Remove the cake from the oven and let it sit undisturbed on a rack for at least 30 minutes for the caramel to settle, then invert it on to a platter. Serve with cream on the side.Napkin cakes with blackberry and white chocolate creamView image in fullscreenWhenSweet, the book I co-authored with Yotam Ottolenghi, came out in 2017, I was invited to talk about baking on a baking podcast calledFlour Hour, hosted by Jeremiah Duarte Bills and Amanda Faber, who were both contestants on The Great American Baking Show. Inevitably, I spoke a lot about my baking process and journey, but, to be honest, I was more interested in hearing Jeremiah speak about his own specialty, namely Portuguese baking. My interest piqued, I then signed up for one of Jeremiah’s online baking tutorials and was delighted to discover that we were makingguardanapos, gorgeous little cakes named after their resemblance to a folded napkin. Jeremiah filled his withdoces de ovos,a traditional sweet egg cream, but, delicious though they were, I couldn’t help thinking about a folded Victoria sponge napkin filled with cream and jam. So here’s my version, with homemade blackberry and lime jam and a white chocolate cream. If you want to make it easier, fill the sponge napkins with a simple vanilla-whipped cream and store-bought jam of your choice. I won’t judge.Prep10 minChill3 hr+Cook1 hr 45 min, plus coolingMakes12 individual cakesFor the fresh blackberry and lime jam600g blackberries, halved if large200g caster sugarFinely grated zest of 1 lime, plus 2 tbsp juiceFor the white chocolate cream100g white chocolate buttons, or chopped into 1cm pieces, if in a block100ml pure (double) cream, plus 160ml extraFor the sponge cake70ml full-cream milk1tsp vanilla bean paste4 eggs, separated50ml sunflower oil40g plain flour35g cornflour¼tsp fine sea salt¼tsp cream of tartar70g caster sugarTo serveIcing sugar, for dustingTo make the jam, put the blackberries in a medium pan and cook over a low heat for about three minutes, pressing on the fruit as it cooks, until you have a soft pulp. Add the sugar and lime juice, stir until the sugar dissolves, then turn up the heat to medium-high and boil for 20-25 minutes, until the setting point is reached (105C on a sugar thermometer). Off the heat, stir in the lime zest, then leave to cool completely.To make the ganache, put the white chocolate in a medium bowl. Put the cream in a small, heavy-based saucepan on a medium-low heat, cook until just starting to simmer, then pour over the chocolate. Leave to sit for three minutes, so the chocolate softens, then gently stir until the chocolate is melted and fully combined. Cover and refrigerate for about three hours (and for up to three days), until cold.To make the sponge, heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and line the bottom of a large, roughly 40cm × 33cm baking tray with baking paper; do not line or grease the sides.Combine the milk and vanilla bean paste in a small saucepan, bring to a simmer, then set aside and cool to tepid.In a large mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks and oil together, then add the tepid vanilla milk. Whisk to combine, then sift in the flour, cornflour and salt, and fold in.Put the egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on medium-high to soft peaks. Still whisking, drizzle in the sugar a tablespoon at a time, then keep beating for another minute or so, until firm peaks form. Using a large hand whisk, gently fold about a third of the egg white mix into the yolk mix, then fold in the remaining two-thirds. Swap the whisk for a large flexible spatula and gently fold until the egg white mixture is fully incorporated.Scrape the batter evenly into the prepared baking tray, using a palette knife to smooth the surface, then bake for 10–12 minutes, or until the cake bounces back when lightly pressed. Transfer to a rack to cool for about 10 minutes.Run a small knife all around the sides of the cake, then lightly dust the top with some sifted icing sugar. Place a large piece of baking paper on top of the cake, then put a large board on top and flip over to release the cake. Carefully peel away the original sheet of baking paper, which will now be on top, then cut the cake into 12 even 10cm squares.To complete the white chocolate filling, put the chilled white chocolate ganache in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Add the remaining 160ml cream and whip on medium-high until it thickens to soft waves.To assemble, place a spoonful of the white chocolate cream in the centre of each square, top with a spoonful of the jam, then gently fold over the sponge diagonally, so that two points join. To serve, arrange the cakes, slightly overlapping, on a serving plate and dust lightly with icing sugar.These recipes are edited extracts from Baking and the Meaning of Life, by Helen Goh, published by Murdoch Books at £26.

The red linoleum floor and minimalist interior do little to soften the impact; I wonder how I’m going to sleep. On the opposite side of the corridor, another member of the group I’m travelling with has a much cooler studio, complete with a small balcony that I immediately recognise from archive black and white photographs.Unconsciously echoing the building’s past, we start using this as a common room, perching on the tubular steel chairs, browsing the collection of books on the desk and discussing what it must have been like to live here. At night, my room stays warm and noise travels easily through the walls and stairwells; it’s not the best night’s rest I’ve ever had, but it’s worth it for the experience.I’m in Dessau, Germany, in the accommodation block once inhabited by students and junior masters at the famousBauhausschool. Also known as the Prellerhaus, the studios are part of a larger asymmetrical complex of connected workshops, classrooms and social spaces – the iconic Bauhaus Building.View image in fullscreenA guest room in the student accommodation block at the Bauhaus school in Dessau.Photograph: Tenschert, Yvonne, 2022/Bildnachweis siehe BeschreibungDesigned by German architect and Bauhaus founderWalter Gropiusafter the school moved here in 1925, and completed in 1926, the revolutionary structure is a mix of glass, steel and concrete. It was a physical expression of the school’s ideas and remains a symbol of European modernism to this day. “It landed here like an alien spaceship,” says Oliver Klimpel, head of the curatorial workshop at the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation.Founded in Weimar in 1919, the highly influential school rejected the principles of local and traditional architecture and design and pursued those that were simple, rational and functional, using innovative ways of teaching and working. Forced to leave Weimar just six years later, owing to financial and political pressure, the school relocated to Dessau in Saxony-Anhalt – then a rising industrial hub with an entrepreneurial spirit and social democratic government – a century ago this year.View image in fullscreenBauhaus students on a balcony of the Prellerhaus, 1931.Photograph: Stiftung Bauhaus DessauWhat followed was a highly successful period for the school and a stronger focus on developing prototypes of furniture, household objects and other items for mass production. Art increasingly merged with industry. “They switched from solid wood to plywood sheets, from upholstery to steel tubes and iron yarn,” our guide, Anke John, explains, standing in Gropius’s old office, where the stench from the triolin floor still lingers. It was in Dessau that Marcel Breuer designed the iconic Wassily Chair, for example.Bauhaus buildings also sprung up across town, before the rise of National Socialism saw the school move again in 1932, this time to Berlin, for one final year before the Nazis came to power.“The empty rooms in the workshop wing appear clean and spacious now, but they were packed with different workshops for printing, weaving, woodwork and metalwork, with tools and machines; it was messy and loud, a maker’s space,” explains Klimpel, adding that the common portrayal of a perfectionist modernist practice in an art school can be very misleading.While regular heatwaves were less of a problem in the 1920s – temperatures were in the high 30s when I visited – the three-storey glass curtain wall, in pursuit of transparency, still created difficult, greenhouse-like conditions in summer. “It was part of the practical research to see what worked and what didn’t; you learned with the building and lived within the experiment,” adds Klimpel.Set among towering oaks and pines, the Masters’ Houses are where Kandinsky, Klee, Moholy-Nagy and Gropius once livedThe structure has undergone changes over time, including repairs to wartime bomb damage, reconstruction of the facade in 1976, and an extensive restoration project based on the original plans, completed in 2006. Today it’s home to a shop, a cafe, exhibition spaces and the offices of the non-profitBauhaus Dessau Foundation. The students’ studios are open to overnight guests, each one kitted out with Bauhaus-inspired furniture, some in the style of former residents such asJosef Albers(studio 204) andMarianne Brandt(studio 302).View image in fullscreenThe Masters’ Houses where Kandinsky, Klee and Gropius once lived.Photograph: Tenschert, Yvonne, 2015/Bildnachweis siehe BeschreibungVisitors can also head to other Bauhaus-related locations in town using a signposted cycle route, taking the number 10 bus (the Bauhauslinie) or by joining a guided tour. I start by walking over to the restored Masters’ Houses, just a short distance away from the Bauhaus Building. Set among towering oaks and pines, these cubic-like white structures with black window frames, plus two abstract rebuilds, are where key figures such asKandinsky,Klee,Moholy-Nagyand Gropius once lived with their families. It feels sleepy and subdued here now, quiet enough to hear acorns crunching under my feet.Other spots not to miss include theKornhaus, a restaurant with a semicircular glazed conservatory on the banks of the Elbe, built in 1929; theArbeitsamt, the yellow-brick employment office designed by Gropius in 1929; and the Dessau Törten housing estate (1926-28), with its rows of modest two-storey, flat-roofed homes, developed to address the housing shortage. The strikingBauhaus Museum, designed by architects from Barcelona and open since 2019, provides plenty of background information and is home to the second largest collection of Bauhaus-related objects in the world, including teaching notes and drafts from the workshops.View image in fullscreenThe Kornhaus, a former restaurant designed in 1929 by Bauhaus architect Carl Fieger.Photograph: Ronny Hartmann/Getty ImagesTo mark the centenary of the school’s move to Dessau, a programme of events and exhibitions – titledAn die Substanz/To the Core– will take place throughout 2025 and 2026, focusing on materials of the modern era. Celebrations kick off this month and include modern interpretations of the so-called Material Dances, part of the course Der Mensch (The Human Being), introduced by Bauhaus teacher Oskar Schlemmer in 1928. Other highlights will includeInvisible Bauhaus Dessau, a new digital tour covering the early days of the Bauhaus members in Dessau, and five central exhibitions opening in March 2026.Berlin by rail: a cold-war adventureRead moreIn between the festivities and the Bauhaus sites, it’s impossible not to notice the decline of this city, which has been merged with Roßlau since 2007. Blocks of GDR flats with worn-down facades are easy to spot and the streets feel quiet, almost deserted, at times. Like many places in eastern Germany, reunification has seen the population shrink, and gradually age. In recent years, the rightwing party Alternative für Deutschland has gained increasing support in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, itsinfluence extending to culture and the Bauhaus.Coming here requires a degree of imagination and reflection. You have to remind yourself that these buildings and ideas were completely new, occasionally provocative, in the 1920s. That the Bauhaus teachers really lived in those white houses. That the workshops were loud and dusty. That students held wild parties and piled out on to those balconies. That Dessau was once a booming place. That this school from a corner of Germany has found its way into everyday design around the world.The trip was supported by theGerman tourist board.

The HMD Pulse is available online for about £70, while Motorola’s Moto G34 is £130.Apple iPhones are a much more expensive option, with handsets from the official store starting at £599 for a newiPhone16e. There are many more offers available online, with the 2022 iPhone SE(at Laptops Direct for £299) a good starting point.Or you could opt to recycle one of your old phones by giving it a new battery and case, and factory-resetting the device. Assuming there are still software updates provided by the manufacturer, you could make a huge saving this way.Set controlsIf your child is under 13, Apple and Google allow you to create child accounts that are linked to your own account so you can manage their usage, such as filtering their search results. If they are older than 13 and have their own account, you can apply various parental controls on an Android phone oriPhoneat setup by connecting it to your, or your family’s, account.You can set screen-time limits, block apps, limit content, put limits on permissions and track their location. Apple’sparental controlsandGoogle’s Family Linkhave guides to getting the settings right.There are some parental controls on all networks, but for those seeking extra control,ParentShieldis a mobile network which allows parents to record and review calls and texts, and has extensive number blocking and spending controls on premium numbers.

This will in turn limit their exposure to scams.This is particularly important for children who are getting their first smartphone, or for those using their device in settings where parents or guardians do not have much scrutiny over what they are doing.MoneyHelper, a service provided by the Money and Pensions Service, says that if children give away their personal details – such as name, birthday and address – criminals can open bank accounts in their name. This could affect their credit rating when they are older.It advises parents to have a frank discussion with their child about not sharing personal details with anyone or when logging into a site or accessing a game.You may be alerted to your child’s details being used by criminals if bank or credit card statements arrive in their name. You can report any ID theft to Action Fraud, the national reporting centre for cybercrime.Show children how to make strong passwords and have them share them with you. The National Cyber Security Centre suggestsusing three random wordstogether to make one long password.Beware ofin-app purchasesThere appears to be no end of “free” games available to download, but they often carry with them fees for in-app purchases, such as buying virtual coins, paying for extra lives or getting a new “skin” for your character.Parents have contacted the Guardianwith horror storiesof how their children ran up bills of thousands of pounds by making hundreds of in-app purchases through a linked payment card.You can turn off in-app purchases through the settings.Link with budgetingSmartphones can be an important tool for children in learning how to spend and budget.The pocket money appGoHenryhas three different tiers of membership (from £3.99 a month per child) with a debit card and access to a platform where the child can set savings goals, while parents can dictate where the card is used and monitor spending. Its website has educational videos and quizzes around managing money.Starling Bank has Kite, again a debit card and app, where kids can check their balance and their spending from their phone, while their parents can top up, monitor spending and set limits. A parent or guardian has to have a Starling current account, and set-up is free.TheHyperJar appcomes with a prepaid card on to which money can be loaded, then allocated to different spending areas in a child’s life such as food, travel and clubs. A teen’s prepaid card costs £4.99.View image in fullscreenParents are advised to have a frank discussion with their child about not sharing their personal details online.Photograph: YakobchukOlena/Getty Images/iStockphotoKeepit safePhones go missing or are stolen all the time, but there are ways to keep track of an errant handset.If your child has anAndroidphone, you can find the mobile’s location in the Family Link app once the device location is turned on. With iPhones, you can use the Family Sharing feature to find lost devices.A phone case is a good idea to try to minimise damage when the mobile is inevitably dropped. Many cases made of silicone or rubber will give a basic level of protection as they are shock absorbent. Thicker cases may be better for teenagers, who can be more prone to dropping their device as they get used to carrying it around. You can spend a little or a lot on a case, but options from the well-known brand OtterBox start at about £20 on Amazon.You can help prevent the screen from getting scratched or cracked with a strengthened-glass screen protector. Prices from Belkin start at just under £20 for smartphones.Go dumbMany parents will only want their child to have the most basic functions on their device, so they can call in an emergency or send an SMS to say when they will be home, for instance. Or you may want to give them a phone with limited features as a softer entry into mobile use.If that is the case, then a “dumb” phone may be the answer, as these have more limited access to messaging apps – for example, you won’t be able to access WhatsApp.Dumb phones tend to be much cheaper than smartphones, so you stand to lose a lot less if your child misplaces theirs or if it is stolen. For example, Nokia has the 110, 225 and 3210 models, priced between £40 and £75.Dumb phones do still have access to the internet, so it is important that you are happy with the parental controls available. Navigating the internet is more cumbersome and fiddly than with a smartphone but is possible. There are also more limited controls in place for parents to lock down the camera, browser and messaging. It is worth checking the manufacturer’s documents to ensure a phone has the controls you want before buying.Also, the limitations of dumb phones may frustrate some parents. For example, they may want to track their child’s movements or know where they are at any given time – features not generally available on typical dumb phones.Explore more on these topicsMobile phonesMoney hacksChildren's techInternet safetyAppsScamsConsumer affairsiPhonefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The trouble is, they keep on movingNic WilsonWed 10 Sep 2025 00.30 EDTShareThe alder carr looks tired and dishevelled today, as if we’ve arrived the morning after the night before. Sedges and nettles have passed their peak – their stems lie splayed across the path. Even the sentry of the woods has forsaken its post beside the boardwalk. When I look over to greet this much-loved guardian (an elder alder with a woodpecker hole of a mouth and a twiglet wave), all that remains is a tangle of rotten wood and the crusty bracket fungus that almost certainly hastened its demise.Beyond the boardwalk, we look out for small teasel (Dipsacus pilosus) – a specialist of damp calcareous soils that has been growing in this wood for at least half a century. Some years it favours an overgrown clearing by the path, where we can admire its dainty white flowers and the spiky spherical seedheads that sway above the nettles like medieval morning stars. But its towering stems are nowhere to be seen.As a biennial plant, the small teasel is always on the move. In its first year of growth, it produces a basal rosette of oval-toothed leaves deep in the undergrowth. Small globular flower heads appear on prickly stems the following summer, after which the seeds set and are dispersed by gravity, birds or the chalk stream.The small teasel’s itinerant nature means an annual hunt, but this year we can’t locate it from the main path, so I head tentatively into the chest-high nettles that have swallowed a track down to the stream. My legs start to sting, but I ignore them. Emerging beside the water, I notice a twinkling around my knees. Though the stems have reached only a fraction of their usual height, here by the water’s edge is a smattering of bristly flowers.Close up, I can see the spine‑tipped bracts (modified leaves) that surround each tiny floret and give the spherical inflorescences their spiky texture. Though the species name “pilosus” means “softly hairy”, nothing about small teasels feels soft to me. But its continued presence is reassuring and I wade back through the nettles, smarting but happy.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsPlantsCountry diaryRural affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her foster mother agreed that she needed a break.Growing up under forced assimilation had been scary, Sonya says, and her Russian-controlled school had offered to take her to a holiday camp in Crimea, a balmy peninsula once famed for being the spa of the Soviet Union.View image in fullscreenChildren at an Avangard camp. The UK imposed sanctions on the organisation over the forced deportation and brainwashing of Ukrainian children.Photograph: Joe Plimmer/TelegramIt was only after they had left that she discovered they were actually being taken to Volgograd, a city more than 600 miles (1,000km) away in the south-west of Russia. Far from being a holiday resort, the city is home to one of a growing number of state-run military-style training camps held for Ukrainian and Russian children.Sonya spent a month at the Avangard camp, which has several other branches across Russia, and hadsanctions imposed on it by the UK in Novemberfor its role in the forced deportation and brainwashing of Ukrainian children. She says she and other children faced a programme of activities that included being taught to dig trenches and rig them with booby traps and trip wires, load machine guns, take part in military-style formations and carry other children on their backs to simulate medical evacuations.Similar to Soviet-era youth camps, these centres have escalated in number since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Criticssay they are used to indoctrinatechildren to prepare them for future service in the Russian military.Now large numbers of children from occupied regions of Ukraine arereportedly being sentalongside the young Russians. The Kremlin portrays these facilities as physical and cultural learning opportunities for children.“The instructors told me that with the certificate given after the training, you can join the Russian army, so I understood it wasn’t just play,” says Sonya. “I was so worried because I knew I would turn 18 soon and could be forced to sign up.”View image in fullscreenSonya thought she was going on a holiday in Crimea but was sent to a training camp hundreds of miles away in Volgograd.Photograph: Liz CookmanAfter more than three years of war, thousands of Ukrainian children remain in Russia after being forcibly transferred or deported, while another 1.6 million are growing up under occupation,according to a report by GlobSec, a Bratislava-based thinktank.Now, concerns are mounting that thechildren are being prepared for combat, with some already thought to be on the frontline.“Forced conscription of foreign nationals is prohibited under international law, regardless of age, but Russia is naturalising these children as citizens to create a legal cover,” says Nathaniel Raymond, director of the Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale University’s school of public health, which documents civilian harm and human rights abuses across Ukraine.View image in fullscreenA flyer showing the rules at the Russian military camps, including not speaking a foreign languageThe goal, says Raymond, is to “erase Ukrainian identity and make the children Russian. Russia has been running versions of this since 2014, scaling up after the full-scale invasion.”Sonya and her family had to take Russian passports and other documents, and at school she had to study the Russian curriculum and language. Her younger brother was also sent to an Avangard camp, where she says he fell victim to the indoctrination.“After being subjected to their propaganda, he took Russia’s side,” she says. “He says he will join the Russian army. He talks about it with his friends.”Researchers at Yale have identified more than 100 camps, some military, others focused on indoctrination and many mixed. They are tailored to age and gender, and researchers have also tracked military vehicle training and shooting ranges using satellite imagery.During their stay,children reportedly hear speechesfrom well-known propagandists and other figures involved in the invasion of Ukraine, learn to operate or assemble drones, and watch second world war re-enactments.

Contact with family is often limited.Sonya says staff at her camp punished Ukrainian boys for disobedience by ordering them to strip to their underwear and perform intense physical exercise. She says they also often used a derogatory Russian term for Ukrainians.Russia’s network of “military-patriotic” camps fits into a broader pattern of militarisation, say observers, with the state organisingincreasing numbers of programmes to prepare its own childrenfor service, teaching them to wear bulletproof gear or design and test drones.View image in fullscreenA poster of President Vladimir Putin adorns a wall at a military camp.Photograph: TelegramUkrainian children in occupied territories are often given little choice about attending, says Megan Gittoes, from the GlobSec thinktank, with conditions at the camps for them frequently abusive – physically, mentally and psychologically. Gittoes says she has documented boys being forced to box each other or endure beatings.“Children are forced into these programmes or their parents risk losing custody. It’s explicitly coercive. Ukrainian children face harsher indoctrination because their identity has to be erased. The aim is to instil fear, dependence on the state and loyalty to Russia,” she says.Gittoes says it is hard to estimate how many children have been signed up to the Russian military. While there is a record of children who have fought for Russia and died since 2014, she says it is has been harder to track things since the full-scale invasion, as occupied areas are cut off and inaccessible.View image in fullscreenMykola Kuleba, head of the charity Save Ukraine, which helps rescue children from Russia.Photograph: Emre Çaylak/The Guardian“We know boys in Zaporizhzhia [a region partly occupied and claimed by Russia] have been told to submit passports for conscription.

He had been taken to Russia by his family, who were sympathetic to Moscow. He did not share their views, but when he was served a draft notice he feared he would be arrested if he did not go. He later managed to escape to an unoccupied area of Ukraine.Kyiv insists that the return of abducted children is non-negotiable in any peace talks, but Moscow denies mass abductions and has dismissed the issue, reportedly offering to return only a token few.After her stint in the military camp, Sonya, now 18, returned to her foster family in an occupied part of Kherson. Scared that she would be forced to return to the camp, she managed to escapeearlier this year with the help of Save Ukraine to Kyiv.

It encompasses about 100 days from late January to early May.GlobalX Ice flightsNote: About 370 flight routes from 19 January 2025 to 2 May 2025.The Guardian reviewed GlobalX deportation flights as well as government detention data and interviewed attorneys, advocates, former officials and immigrants who have been through the system. The analysis has revealed that:GlobalX carried out more than 1,700 flights for Ice, the vast majority of them between domestic US airports. The airline transported nearly 1,000 children, including nearly 500 children under the age of 10, and 22 infants.For many immigrants, the flight paths were long, with multiple legs and layovers. Nearly 3,600 people were moved around repeatedly, forced to board five or more GlobalX flights.Immigrants were also moved between detention facilities more than before. The average number of transfers per person has markedly increased in the past six months, and some detained immigrants have been moved as many as 10 or 20 times.Detainees were moved around the US without notice, to locations far from their families, communities and legal counsel – leading to apparent violations of constitutional due process rights.Along their journeys, immigrants say they were repeatedly kept in the dark about where they were going. Some say they were threatened by immigration agents with long-distance transfers and separation from their families if they did not accept voluntary deportation.“It just seems so fundamentally inhumane,” said Sirine Shebaya, executive director of the National Immigration Project, a non-profit legal advocacy group. “The administration is using the system to make it as prohibitively cruel as it possibly can for the people going through.”Immigrants are being moved around via chartered flights operated by various private contractors, as well as by commercial airlines, buses and cars.But perhaps more so than any other transportation company, GlobalX, a Miami-based charter airline, has become a crucial tool of the US deportation machine – operating more than half of Ice deportation flights in 2024 and 2025. The company, which had initially marketed itself tosports teams and rock bandsseeking to travel in luxury, now earnsmostof its revenue from its Ice contract.It was the airline the Trump administration tappedto movehundreds of Venezuelan men to El Salvador, despite a judicial order blocking the flight. It was also the operator of a now infamous deportation flight to Brazil during which multiple passengers fainted from heat exhaustion.GlobalX did not respond to a request for comment.The leaked GlobalX flight manifests provide one of the most detailed views available of the scale and scope of Trump’s mass deportation scheme.Quick GuideHow the Guardian reported on leaked GlobalX flight dataShowInfants sent overseas. People shuttled to different detention centers across the country five, 10, 15 times over a period of a few weeks. Lawyers desperate to find their clients. Detention centers exceed capacity as people wait for their deportation flights. A Guardian US investigation has revealed new details about the US government’s chaotic mass deportation effort, including exclusive analysis of deportation flights during the first months of the Trump administration.Our reporting relied in part on details of over 1,700 flights and passenger lists encompassing more than 44,000 people that were anonymously leaked to the Guardian in May 2025, following a hack of Global Crossing, the charter airline that provides deportation flights across and outside the US. The hacking group Anonymous claimed to be responsible for the breach.The leaked information included passenger names, personally identifying information for those passengers, flight numbers, flight details, and other data for deportation flights that occurred in the first 100 days of Donald Trump’s presidency, between January and May. The data was leaked to a number of media outlets, including the Guardian, unprompted.On 5 May, GlobalX confirmedin a letter to the SECthat it had learned of recent “unauthorized activity within its computer networks and systems supporting portions of its business applications”, which it determined was the result of a “cybersecurity incident”.Reporters verified the authenticity of the data in a few different ways, using public and previously unreported deportations, as well as public flight info and file metadata.We verified the deportation journeys of every person interviewed for the series, like Andry José Hernández Romero, and checked to make sure that their journeys matched the data in the leaked manifests. Each person’s recollection of their deportations match the origins, destinations and times listed in the leaked data.Reporters also located individuals whose names and stories were not public, and confirmed that the flight patterns described in the data were accurate. In one case, the details of which have never been made public, reporters looked up the flights of a person deported to Colombia after being apprehended at the northern border and matched the person by name and birthday within the GlobalX data. Reporters then verified each step of the individual’s deportation journey in the leaked data.The Guardian also found other details that supported the authenticity of the data. An analysis of file metadata found that the files were created at various points in time between 3 May and 4 May, matching the approximate time frame GlobalX said its records were breached. We also verified that flights labeled with “CANCEL” or “CANCELED” in the messages field were canceled by comparing the tail numbers of flights in FlightAware with flights in our data. Flight details in our data match publicly available flight data.In addition to the manifests and flight logs from GlobalX, the Guardian’s reporting relied on additional data from the Deportation Data Project, a group of academics and lawyers using records requests to obtain and release anonymized immigration enforcement data to support our findings. The data was used to calculate daily populations at different detention facilities and to analyze the frequency of transfers between detention centers, which helped support other findings of the Guardian’s investigation.GlobalX did not respond to a request for comment.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The US has always moved immigrants around – most commonly, when a detention center reaches capacity, officials transfer detainees to facilities with more available beds. But the Trump administration is now shuffling immigrants around more frequently than before.In some cases, lawyers believe that the government is deliberately moving their clients to jurisdictions where immigration judges are less likely to grant asylum, or where legal injunctions blocking Trump immigration policies do not apply.TheDHS said that immigrants in custody are informed about their transfers and allowed to contact their families throughout. “Claims that transfers of detainees are being ‘weaponized’ or ‘hidden’ are also categorically false,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs.“Despite a historic number of injunctions, DHS is working rapidly and overtime to remove these aliens from detention centers to their final destination – home,” McLaughlin said. “All transfers are made in accordance with strict guidelines.”According toprotocolsestablished in 2012, Ice is supposed to minimize long-distance transfers and generally avoid moving detainees away from their immediate family and attorneys. The American Immigration Council and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network (RMIAN) havefiled a lawsuitto determine whether Ice is adhering to those policies, or whether transfer rules have been changed.For immigrants in the system, these chaotic transfers can feel like a punishment, designed to wear people down, said Faisal Al-Juburi, head of external affairs at the legal aid group Raíces.“You end up in a continuous state of unknown for an indefinite period of time,” he said. “Families are being put into a purgatorial state.”The plane made a stop, but he never knew whereAndry José Hernández Romero, one of252 Venezuelan menthat the US expelled to El Salvador’s most notorious mega-prison, is still trying to make sense of why and how he ended up where he did.He had come to the US southern border in August 2024, arriving just after his 31st birthday. After an initial screening, US officials determined that Hernández Romero, a queer makeup artist who had faced discrimination in his home country, could have a valid claim to asylum. They placed him at a detention center near San Diego, California, while he awaited a hearing to decide his case.About a month into the second Trump administration, everything started to go topsy-turvy. At the crack of dawn on 8 March, an official told him to get ready – he was being moved. When he asked where he was going, an official responded: “To a much better place.”He was given no specifics.He was first moved to Phoenix, and then loaded on to a GlobalX plane. Leaked records show that flight stopped – unbeknown to his lawyers – in Phoenix, then Las Vegas, then Seattle and finally Harlingen, Texas.None of this made sense. Hernández Romero was due to appear in immigration court, in California, the following week.Map showing the path of Andry José Hernández RomeroLindsay Toczylowski, the co-founder of Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef) and Hernández Romero’s lawyer, thought it was strange. She figured the government would fly him back to San Diego for his court appointment. But the appointment came, and Hernández Romero wasn’t there. “This is highly unusual, but again, at the time, Ice didn’t seem to have any information,” she said.She believed it was a bureaucratic mix-up. It was a Friday, and she assumed the government would reschedule his hearing for the upcoming Monday.And yet, something seemed off.That weekend, lawyers from ImmDef called the detention center to which Hernández Romero had been transferred, and they were told he was no longer there. “They actually said to us it might be that he has just left for a little while and is coming back,” said Toczylowski. “We had no idea what to make of it.”Hernández Romero, meanwhile, came to suspect that the officials around him were lying. Many of his compatriots – others who had been shuttled to the same Texas detention center – were starting to get suspicious as well.José Manuel Ramos Bastidas was worried he would be sent to the US naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba – where the US government had already sent a group of Venezuelan men accused of criminal violations and gang membership.Bastidas had first arrived in the US in March 2024.In February of 2025 – after months of being detained at the Stewart detention center in Lumpkin, Georgia – he was transferred to an Ice facility in El Paso, Texas. From there, he called his wife, and told her to record his message, to share with the public should anything happen to him. “They detained me simply because of my tattoos. I am not a criminal. I have been here for 10 months,” he said. “This is simply in case something happens to me … if they keep transferring me to another detention center.”A few weeks later, he was moved to a facility in Raymondville, Texas. Officials initially told him he would be going to Mexico. “At the end they said we were going to make a stop in Honduras and then go on to Venezuela,” he said.He felt a moment of hope then – maybe, finally, he would see his two-year-old son, his wife, his mother.On board the plane – an Airbus A320 with 179 seats – staff told the shackled detainees not to open any of the shades. “But we thought, it’s fine, we’re going to Venezuela – that was the goal,” he said. At least, that’s what he and the others kept saying to each other, almost, in a way, to reassure one another.The plane made a stop, but he never knew where.It refueled, took off again, and finally landed. “We opened the window [shades],and there we saw blue letters that saidEl Salvador. And we saw many, many police and soldiers, and tanks, helicopters, drones. That’s when the terror began.”Map showing the path of José Manuel Ramos BastidasFor the next four months, Hernández Ramos, Ramos Bastidas and 250 other Venezuelan men were cut off from the outside world. The US government never released a full list of all the men it had condemned toCecot– leaving dozens of families to guess at whether their loved ones had been sent there.“The government has never done something like this before, taking an asylum seeker and disappearing them – putting them on a plane to a third country,” said Toczylowski. “I had never seen that happen. So it wasn’t something we were anticipating.”Human rights and legal aid groups, in the meantime, were noticing it was becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of many of their other clients. “It really is very strange, you get someone who’s picked up, they go to a hold cell, they stay there for seven days – which is completely outrageous. They then get moved to Florida. From there, they get taken to Arizona, then they end up in Texas,” said Shebaya of the National Immigration Project. “It’s like this wild goose chase, trying to follow where the person is and what the reasons are even for moving them.”For lawyers, hours spent searching for clientsPeople in Ice detention have always been transferred between facilities, but transfers increased in frequency after Trump took office. A Guardian analysis of anonymized detention data from the Deportation Data Project, a group of academics and lawyers focused on immigration enforcement data, has found that the people who entered Ice detention between September 2023 and January 2025 – during the Biden administration – were transferred twice, on average. Immigrants that were booked into Ice detention since the start of the second Trump administration have been transferred more frequently, an average of three times per person.Chart showing an increase in the average number of transfers of a person in ice detention beginning after Trump’s inauguration.It has become routine for immigration attorneys to spend hours each day trying to find their clients. Increasingly, they said, searches in Ice’s online detainee locator system – which is meant to provide real-time updates on where migrants are being held – were proving futile.Often, the system was wrong, or out of date.At one point, it logged that a number of people were being held in Washington DC – which does not have any Ice detention centers. “At some point we realized that some of them had been sent to Guantánamo Bay,” Shebaya said.During the militarized immigration raids in Los Angelesin June, lawyers from ImmDef and other groups compiled a list of about 1,200 people arrested. They have been unable to find about 400 of them, said Toczylowski.“We have an entire team that is just looking every single day to try to locate people, so then we can communicate with them, offer them representation, and try and get them help,” she said.At times, attorneys said, the government has moved clients to states and locations where immigration judges tend to grant asylum at lower rates, or where petitions for a writ of habeas corpus challenging detentions are harder to obtain.In some cases, when the administration has tried to use unconventional or obscure procedures to expel immigrants, attorneys have filed legal complaints accusing the DHS of moving people to judicial districts that were more likely to side with the Trump administration. In March, the administration used a cold war-era provision to arrest pro-Palestinian student activists – and swiftly shuttled them to detention centers in Louisiana and Texas, triggering a series of legal battles about which judges should oversee the students’ cases.In April, a federal judge in the southern district of Texas banned the government from usingthe Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law, to deport Venezuelans accused of gang membership. Ice soon moved two Venezuelan men from a south Texas detention center to a different one in northern Texas, where the ban did not apply. Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union accused the DHS of “shipping” the men to a friendlier jurisdiction.Previously, it was not uncommon for immigrants who arrived at the southern border to be moved to detention centers all over the US. But in June and July, the number of Ice chartered flights between US cities increased twofold compared with prior months, according to flight data compiled by Tom Cartwright, an immigration advocate who has been tracking Ice flights for nearly six years.“There is a lot of movement, and it really has accelerated significantly,” Cartwright said.The DHS has moved to arrest record numbers of immigrants and keep them detained rather than releasing people on bond. In the aftermath of ramped-up raids in cities across the US, immigration officials are scrambling to find space in the detention system to hold detainees.“It’s hard to say how much of that is due to capacity issues at detention centers, and how much of that is for other reasons. But I don’t think the numbers lie at all,” Cartwright said.A ‘particularly cruel’ fateFor immigrants inside the system – the chaos is punishing.When LW, a 37-year-old mother who came to the US with her 10-year-old son in April seeking asylum, immigration agents told her she must either return to China with her kid – or the government would separate them.She tried to explain to border patrol agents in San Diego that she had faced political persecution back home, that both she and her son could be killed if they ever went back. It was to no avail.She and her son spent about a week at a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facility, sleeping on a thin mattress on the floor. They weren’t able to make any calls. “No contact with the outside world. I was still not able to let my boyfriend know that we were alive,” she said in a sworn declaration in her immigration case, shared with her permission by her lawyers at Raíces.Eventually, officials presented her with deportation documents. She refused to sign.Two days later, at about 4am, LW said, agents forced her and her son into an unmarked blue car. They were driven to the airport.“According to them, if I did not get on this plane, I would have to be taken on a military aircraft back to China,” she said. “My heart dropped.”She was frantic – using all the English she could muster to plead her case. She said they grabbed both of her arms and began pulling her toward the terminal. “Desperate and terrified of what might happen, I dropped to the ground,” she said.Eventually, she said, after conferring among themselves, the agents loaded LW and her son back into the blue car. By then, she said, both were crying – and the agents told them to shut up.Two days later, LW and her son were moved to a family detention center in Dilley, Texas – where they were able to connect with lawyers at Raíces.Two weeks after that, LW disappeared from Ice’s online detainee locator system.Her lawyers scrambled to piece together what had happened. LW had been moved to an Ice detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, while her son was sent to a shelter for unaccompanied minors, managed by the Office of Refugee Resettlement.The agents told her the only way she could see her son again was if she returned to China. “We cannot return to China. My life and my son’s life will be at risk,” LW said. “It took great sacrifices and risk to even be able to escape and get here.”Before her lawyers were able to meet with her in New Jersey, LW was moved again – to El Paso, Texas. And then again, to Chaparral, New Mexico. It took LW’s legal team at Raíces 11 weeks to make contact with her. She and her son have now been separated for 16 weeks.“Based upon everything that we can see, this is punishment… a punishment for not acquiescing,” said Al-Juburi of Raices. “The system is designed to make you, as an immigrant, give up, to make you more likely to self-deport.”The DHS defended current practices.“Parents, who are in the US illegally, can take control of their departure. Through the [Customs and Border Protection] Home App, the Trump administration is giving parents illegally in the country a chance to take full control of their departure and self-deport, with the potential ability to return the legal, right way and come back to live the American dream,” said McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary of public affairs.She added: “Rather than separate families, Ice asks parents if they want to be removed with their children or if the child should be placed with someone safe the parent designates.”Immigration attorneys across the US have reported that clients are given ultimatums, rather than a real choice. During the LA raids, at least four pregnant women were picked up and transferred to detention centers in Florida, said Toczylowski of ImmDef.Another of her clients was arrested in LA, in front of his eight-year-old son and flown, almost immediately afterwards, to Tacoma, Washington. “I saw his son crying and devastated,” she said. The family has remained separated since then.“It seems the goal is to make people desperate enough so they decide not to fight their case, so they decide that the quickest way to see their other children or make sure they don’t have to deliver their babies in shackles is to accept a voluntary deportation,” said Toczylowski. “It is particularly cruel.”Additional reporting by Raima AmjadContributorsGraphics: Andrew WitherspoonIllustrations: Angelica AlzonaVisuals editing: Marcus PeabodyCopy editor: Rusha HaljuciQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The fourth-largest took place in South Korea, where the former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, repeatedly targeted critical media and his governmentused defamation lawsuitsto silence journalists before being ousted earlier this year.The report described greatly differing contexts for problems facing the media. InNew Zealand, it said, a crisis has been marked by the shrinking of the media landscape, leaving four out of five journalists working for one of only five employers. In Palestine, it said, nearly 200 journalists have been killed since October 2023, and Israel has imposed a blockade on international press entering the Gaza Strip independently.“Between 2024 and 2025, Al Jazeera was targeted by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which have suspended the media outlet’s operations over alleged national security concerns and tensions over its coverage of certain events,” the report notes.Chile recorded the largest improvement in freedom of expression since the International IDEA’s last report in 2021, owing in part to landmark draft legislation aimed at enhancing the safety of journalists, as well as their families.Brothers, cousins, sons: the human stories behind four of the war’s fallen journalistsRead moreThe thinktank highlighted some positive developments:Africarecorded a large share of the global advances in democracy, accounting for 24% of the countries making progress – most notably Botswana and South Africa. Parliamentary elections in Jordan in 2024 were praised for increased fairness and Poland saw improvements too.But the US, though a country long regarded as a leading advocate for democracy worldwide, has significantly reduced both its diplomatic engagement and its financial support for international democracy assistance this year, the report’s authors wrote.“These developments have contributed to a weakening of international democratisation efforts. In less than six months, US domestic political institutions have also lost much of their symbolic sheen, increasingly serving as a reference point for executive overreach and offering more encouragement to populist strongman leaders than to pro-democracy hopefuls,” they said.In 2021, International IDEAadded the USto its list of “backsliding” democracies for the first time, pointing to a “visible deterioration” that it said began in 2019.One measure that may encourage and reinforce democracy would be wider offering of votes for people living abroad, the thinktank argues.“Improving rights of voters living abroad can also reap democratic dividends in both home and host countries,” said Casas-Zamora.Explore more on these topicsPress freedomAfricaChileNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesSouth KoreaNew ZealandnewsShareReuse this content"

About 10 minutes later, two other women in their 20s were killed by gunshots to the head in a bedroom in the same area, with police saying the deaths may be linked.The suspected double murders came a day after those of a 20- and 22-year-old, whose genders were not disclosed by police, in neighbouring Eikendal.On 5 September, a man wasshot deadat a magistrates court in suspected gang violence, thethird killingin a Cape Town court since April.Cape Town is one of the most violent cities in one of the most violent countries in the world. The murder rate in South Africa is behind only Jamaica and Ecuador, according todatafrom the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Last year, Cape Town had the second highest murder rate of any municipality in South Africa, behind Nelson Mandela Bay, and the 16th highest globally, according toSeguridad Justicia y Paz, a Mexican NGO.More than 2.4 million people visited Cape Town in 2024, according tocity authorities, drawn by its beaches, mountains and nearby vineyards. However, the city is deeply divided between opulent suburbs and the poorer Cape Flats townships, where non-white people were forced to move in the years after the apartheid regime passed the Group Areas Act of 1950.“Our communities are fearful,” Lynn Phillips, from the Cape Flats Safety Forum, told AFP last week at an anti-gang protest. “We don’t have to switch on Netflix to hear gun violence. We sleep, we eat, and we wake up with gun violence.”Western Cape police said last week they were carrying out “targeted operations” in Cape Flats hotspots to seize firearms and ammunition. A statement said: “The message is clear: illegal firearms and those who profit from them have no place in our communities. Our operations will continue without fear or favour, until gangsterism and the violence associated with it are rooted out of the Western Cape.”The acting police minister, Firoz Cachalia, told Cape Flats community members at a meeting on Tuesday that local police did not have the capabilities for “intelligence-driven operations” to successfully tackle gangs and organised crime,local media reported.“There is no proper plan in Cape Town to deal with gang violence in the province,” said Cachalia, who is from the African National Congress party, while Cape Town and the Western Cape are run by their national coalition partners, the Democratic Alliance.More than 26,000 people were murdered in South Africa last year, South African policedatashows. Almost 3,500 of those were in Cape Town, according to Seguridad Justicia y Paz.Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaGun crimeAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It’s stressful and also frustrating.”The country has also being facing fuel, food and other shortages amid its worst economic crisis in decades.Havana state worker Danai Hernández, said she was on the way home from work which had just shut down.“I’m going home to organize everything in the household and … now we have to wait. We don’t have any other choice,” she said, visibly upset.‘There is no money’: Cuba fears total collapse amid grid failure and financial crisisRead moreCuba’s oil-fired power plants, already obsolete and struggling to keep the lights on, reached a full crisis last year as oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico dwindled.In October 2024, the island, which is suffering its worst economic crisis in three decades, was plunged into darkness for several days following a shutdown of the Antonio Guiteras thermoelectric power plant, the island’s biggest.Cuba’s energy crisis has worsened in recent years due to US sanctions intended to put pressure on the island to change its political model.The sanctions have prevented the Caribbean country from having sufficient foreign currency to buy fuel or repair its ageing thermoelectric plants, many of which have been operating for more than 30 years.The blackouts have led to rare anti-government protests.Explore more on these topicsCubaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!”EU officials, led by the bloc’s sanctions chief, David O’Sullivan, participated in the discussions in Washington, which featured senior US treasury officials.News of the discussions came as Mexico announced it would raise its tariffs on automobiles fromChinaand other Asian countries to 50%, from a prior level of 20%.The economy minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said the move was intended to protect jobs in Mexico.The pressure on the EU from Trump comes at a pivotal moment for his tariff policies. In May, theUS trade court ruledthat the tariffs “exceed any authority granted to the president”. A federal appeals courtupheldthat ruling at the end of August, and the case is now heading to the supreme court.The supreme court hearing is set to hear the case in the first week in November and the tariffs remain in place ahead of its ruling. But the uncertain future of Trump’s tariffs has complicated the administration’s negotiations with trading nations and threatens to leave the US with a huge bill should the court rule against them.On Sunday, Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, said he was “confident” that the administration would win its case at the supreme court, althoughlegal experts are dividedand the lower courts have consistently ruled against them.Bessent has said the US would have to refund tens of billions of dollars in tariffs should the court rule them illegal. “We would have to give a refund on about half the tariffs, which would be terrible for the treasury,” Bessent said in an interview Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press.Explore more on these topicsRussiaDonald TrumpUkraineTariffsIndiaChinaEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

He pinned her to the ground and repeatedly forced his tongue into her mouth, at one point blocking her nose to stop her from breathing, according to court records.Choi managed to break free by biting off 1.5cm of his tongue.In one of South Korea’s most contentious rulings on sexual violence, the aggressor received only six months in prison, suspended for two years, for trespassing and intimidation – but not attempted rape.From spy cams to deepfake porn: fury in South Korea as women targeted againRead moreChoi, now 79, was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm and handed a 10-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. That decision was overturned on Wednesday by the Busan district court which ruled her actions constituted “justifiable self-defence” under South Korean law.Choi’s actions at the time are now “deemed an attempt to escape an unjust infringement on her bodily integrity and sexual self-determination”, the court said in a statement.The ruling overturns Choi’s 1965 conviction, when the court found her actions had “exceeded the reasonable bounds of legally permissible self-defence”.Choi smiled as supporters handed her bouquets of flowers after the ruling. Women’s rights activists and supporters celebrated, waving a placard that read: “Choi Mal-ja did it!”In a press conference after the ruling, Choi said: “Sixty-one years ago, in a situation where I could understand nothing, the victim became the perpetrator and my fate was sealed as a criminal. For the victims who shared the same fate as mine, I wanted to be a source of hope for them.”Choi’s appeal gained momentum after the #MeToo movement that took off in 2017 inspired her to seek justice. In South Korea, women’s rights protests have led to victories on issues ranging from abortion access to tougher penalties for spycam crimes.Choi filed for a retrial in 2020, but lower courts initially rejected her petition.After years of campaigning and an appeal, South Korea’s highest court finally ordered a retrial in 2024. At its first hearing,prosecutors apologised to Choiand asked the court to overturn her conviction.Her lawyers said they plan to seek compensation from the state for the damages she suffered from her conviction six decades ago.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaAsia PacificWomenRape and sexual assault#MeToo movementnewsShareReuse this content"

He waskilled in an exchange of firewith police after reports of a burglary in the remote town of Piopio, in the central North Island, on Monday.Later on Monday, two of his children were found safe and well at a campsite in Waitomo. It is understood the third child was with Phillips at the time of the shooting.After identifying what they believe to be Phillips’ main campsite for the last few months, police said it appeared he had received outside assistance.Hidden for nearly four years: how the saga of fugitive father Tom Phillips unfolded in New ZealandRead more“We are currently looking at a number of items at the site. Aside from the burglaries we are now able to link to Tom, it is apparent that he had outside help,” said detective senior sergeant Andrew Saunders.“As the investigation has been going on, we’ve always suspected Tom Phillips has been receiving help,” Saunders said.Police would now open a new investigation to identify anyone who helped Phillips. Objects found at the campsite would be analysed to see if they could be linked to burglaries or had been purchased for Phillips.“We think it’s absolutely important that we continue to look for those people that have been supporting Tom Phillips and hold them accountable.”View image in fullscreenImages of the campsite released by New Zealand police on Wednesday.Photograph: New Zealand PoliceThe pictures released on Wednesday show a campsite found roughly 200m from the site where his children were discovered, police said in a statement.The images show a steep incline where tarpaulins have been erected among the trees. Camouflage netting covers one corner of a large structure. Inside the campsite is a gas cylinder, a portable stove top, large buckets, gumboots and a tent that looks to be set into a dugout area.It was difficult to access, well-hidden and highlighted the challenging environment the family used as its base, they said.“It’s a very grim, dimly-lit area, surrounded by dense bush. The tent was well covered and dry,” said detective Saunders.The campsite was “very dirty”, cramped and “not very nice for children”, he told media on Wednesday afternoon.The site was likely Phillips’ main campsite in recent months but not necessarily the primary place the family had lived in since they vanished, Saunders said.Images released on Tuesdayshowed the campsite where two of Phillips’ children were found. Police said at least one firearm and ammunition were discovered at the campsite, about 2km from where Phillips had been killed.

Phillips did not have legal custody of his children. He was facing a raft of charges, including aggravated robbery, aggravated wounding and unlawful possession of a firearm. Experts haveexpressed concernabout the children’s reintegration into society.The children’s’ mother, Cat, told Radio New Zealand’s Mata programme that she did not yet know when she would be reunited with her children.Police minister Mark Mitchell told Mata it was a “complex situation”.The children are now in child protective custody. An urgent suppression order was granted in the high court in relation to aspects of the case on Tuesday evening after an application by a lawyer acting on behalf of the Phillips family.On Tuesday, Warwick Morehu from Oranga Tamariki told reporters the children were settled and “doing well under the circumstances”. He described the situation as “unprecedented” and appealed to the public to give the family privacy.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He lost his seat in 2022 and regained it in 2025.The MP’s past register of interests shows that he entered the short trade around February 2020, which coincided with a then record high of Australia’s benchmark ASX 200 index.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Markets have rallied again over the past two years, buoyed by the boom in artificial intelligence technology, leading to recent record highs.Wilson’s BetaShares investment is now down more than 70% from those early 2020 levels.His register of interests also records an investment in an international equity index fund and micro-investing platform, along with a residential and investment property.Recent analysis by Guardian Australia found thatmore than half the politicians in federal parliament own investment properties or multiple homes, with at least 50 receiving rental income as landlords.Explore more on these topicsTim WilsonCoalitionLiberal partyAustralian politicsBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

The UK is considering deploying Typhoon jets as part of an enhanced air policing mission to protect the alliance’s eastern flank.There had been at least 19 violations of Polish airspace overnight, said Tusk, and some of them had enteredPolandfrom Belarusian territory. Four Polish airports, including the two that serve Warsaw, were closed to traffic during the incursion. The prime minister of the Netherlands, Dick Schoof, said F-35 jets from his country took part in the mission to intercept the drones. At least three drones were shot down.Tusk, who convened an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, said: “We are dealing with a large-scale provocation … We are ready to repel such provocations. The situation is serious and no one doubts that we must prepare for various scenarios.”Russian drones in Polish airspaceOn social media, Donald Trump posted: “What’s with Russia violating Poland’s airspace with drones? Here we go!”The White House said Trump would speak to Poland’s newly elected nationalist president, Karol Nawrocki, while the US ambassador to Nato, Matthew Whitaker, reiterated backing for Warsaw amid concerns inEuropeover how the Trump administration might respond to a Russian attack on Nato. “We stand by our Nato allies in the face of these airspace violations and will defend every inch of Nato territory,” wrote Whitaker in a post on X.The British defence secretary, John Healey, said he had asked the UK armed forces to look at “options to bolster Nato’s air defence over Poland”. He was speaking after an E5 meeting of ministers from France, Germany, the UK, Italy and Poland, which his Polish counterpart had left early to return home due to the drone incursion.Healey said: “Today, as five nations, we say to President Putin: your aggression only serves to strengthen the unity between our Nato nations; your aggression only serves to strengthen our determination to stand with Ukraine.”Russia launches almost nightly attacks on Ukraine using large, kamikaze drones based on an Iranian design and known informally as “Shaheds”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Wednesday morning that 415 drones and 40 missiles had been used in the overnight attack, most targeting western parts of the country. One person was killed in Zhytomyr region.Zelenskyy urged Nato countries to launch a strong response to the incursion into Poland. “Moscow is always testing the limits of the possible, and if it does not meet a strong reaction, moves to a new level of escalation,” Zelenskyy wrote in a post on social media. “Today was another escalatory step … Not one ‘Shahed’, which could have been called an accident, but at least eight attack drones which targeted Poland.”Russia’s defence ministry released a statement saying Moscow had “no intentions to engage any targets on the territory of Poland”, without confirming or denying that its drones had entered Polish airspace. “We are ready to hold consultations on this subject with the Polish defence ministry,” it added.Russia’s chargé d’affaires in Poland, Andrei Ordash, called the accusations against Moscow groundless, saying “no evidence has been presented proving these drones are of Russian origin”.Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, said Warsaw had “no doubt” that it was dealing with a deliberate attack. “When one or two drones does it, it is possible that it was a technical malfunction, but … in this case there were 19 breaches, and it simply defies imagination that that could be accidental,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One of the drones damaged a building on the ground in eastern Poland but there were no reports of casualties.Tusk insisted there was “no reason to panic”, but said Poland had invoked Nato’s article 4, requesting formal consultations with the alliance. Article 4 has been invoked only seven times since Nato was created in 1949, with the last time in 2022 in the immediate aftermath of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Andriy Sybiha, Ukraine’s foreign minister, called on neighbouring countries to shoot down Russian missiles and drones over Ukrainian airspace, especially in the western regions of the country close to the border with Nato nations. “Ukraine has suggested such a step for a long time. It needs to be taken for the sake of collective security,” he said.Up to now Ukraine’s neighbours have declined to do so, fearing the escalatory potential of directly engaging with Russian missiles and drones.Russia and Belarus will hold a big military drill on Friday known as Zapad, which has raised security concerns in the region and led to Poland closing all its land borders with Belarus.Trump came into office promising a swift end to the war, but has proved unable to persuade Putin to agree a ceasefire. A bilateral summit in Alaska last month yielded few results and Kyiv hopes Trump will put pressure on Moscow after deadlines set by the White House for Russia were ignored. Earlier this week, an Iskander cruise missile hit the cabinet of ministers, a key government building in Kyiv.Wednesday’s incursion into Poland was the first reported occasion when Nato defence forces had directly engaged Russian drones. Poland has been on alert for craft entering its airspace since a stray Ukrainian missile struck a southern Polish village in 2022, killing two people.During the drone attack, the Polish authorities closed several airports, including Chopin airport in Warsaw, the country’s largest, and the key logistics and arms transfer hub in the south-eastern city of Rzeszów. Early morning departures were delayed for several hours and a number of arriving flights were diverted to other Polish airports. An Air China plane from Beijing due to land at Chopin was sent to Copenhagen.Explore more on these topicsPolandNatoRussiaUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But a permanently exhausted cockpit crew is a significant risk.”She said staff shortages and “rising operational pressure” had worsened the situation for pilots, particularly during the summer months.The union said it defined napping as “controlled rest phases during the flight phase”.Explore more on these topicsAir transportGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A budget for next year must be agreed within the coming weeks, even though the political parties are at loggerheads.1:12Demonstrators scuffle with police amid Block Everything protests across France – videoLecornu, who as defence minister for the past three years was known for his work on increasing French military spending, said: “We are going to have to change, be more creative and serious in our way of working with the opposition.” He said there must be deep changes to working methods, but also to the substance of politics.Lecornu said he would address France “in the coming days” to explain his approach, which he promised would be different from the past. He is expected to take several weeks to form a new government. The new prime minister began meeting party leaders as tens of thousands of protesters held anational day of demonstrationson Wednesday, barricading roads and gathering in town centres as 80,000 police were deployed across France.Lecornu is seen as representing continuity rather than change. He had a background on the right in Nicolas Sarkozy’s party before joining Macron’s centrists eight years ago. He is seen as one of Macron’s most loyal allies, having been in government since Macron wasfirst electedin 2017.Lecornu is so close to Macron that he has been called “Macron’s spiritual son”. Opposition parties, which had wanted a radical change of direction from a new prime minister, warned on Wednesday that they remained highly critical and a wrong step could lead to Lecornu being toppled in a no-confidence vote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can appreciate our scepticism. What French people are asking for is a change of politics.”The leftwing party La France Insoumise announced an immediate no-confidence motion against Lecornu in parliament, but for now without backing from other parties. Lecornu’s challenge is to at least convince a majority of opposition parties to refrain from ousting him in a no-confidence vote.Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally party said Lecornu was “in a very precarious position”. He said unless there was proof of a real change in politics, there would be a no-confidence motion and Lecornu would “fall”. Bardella said: “I fear that Macron has once again made a choice of instability.”Sébastien Chenu, the vice-president of Le Pen’s party, said it would be “very surprising” if Lecornu, a Macron ally, “broke with Macron’s politics”.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeEmmanuel MacronnewsShareReuse this content"

Pushed back with teargas by riot police, Jess, who asked for her real name not to be published, said she was scared by police tactics but felt it was crucial to be on the streets.“Public services are failing, the quality of care in hospitals is getting worse,” she said. “Years of cuts to the health sector means doctors suffer, patients suffer.

In Montreuil, banners read “Macron give the money back” and featured jokes about barricades being “Bayroucades”.After Macron called an inconclusive snap election last year,parliament remains dividedbetween the left, the far right and the centre, with no absolute majority. Many voters on the left and far right felt their calls for change had been ignored and that by appointing Lecornu, Macron was sticking firmly to his pro-business economic policy.Eighty-thousand police and gendarmes were mobilised across France on Wednesday as protesters attempted to block roads, built barricades or gathered in town centres. By mid-afternoon there had been more than 300 arrests, with more than 180 in Paris. At Paris’s Gare du Nord, riot police stopped hundreds of protesters from entering the building and fired teargas in nearby streets. In Lyon, protesters blocked a road running through the city and set bins on fire. In the western city of Nantes and in the southern city of Marseille police used teargas to disperse protesters. South of Limoges, tractors blocked a key road.

Israel’s attack the previous day killed six members of Hamas who were negotiating a ceasefire deal brokered by the US and other Gulf countries.“He needs to be brought to justice,” al-Thani said of the Israeli prime minister.Netanyahu has responded defiantly to international criticism for the attack, including a White House statement that the “unilateral bombing” insideQatar“does not advance Israel or America’s goals.”In a video statement, Netanyahu accused Qatar of harbouring terrorists and suggested he reserved the right to continue attacks in the future. “I say to Qatar and all nations who harbour terrorists, you either expel them or you bring them to justice,” he said. “Because if you don’t, we will.”Al-Thani accused Netanyahu of “wasting” Qatar’s time in hosting negotiations between Israel andHamasand said his country would reassess “everything” about its role as mediator in the conflict.“I was meeting one of the hostage’s families the morning of the attack,” al-Thani said. “They are counting on this [ceasefire] mediation, they have no other hope for that.”Map showing location of Israeli strike in Doha.“I think that what Netanyahu has done yesterday, he just killed any hope for those hostages,” he added.Other Israeli officials have also responded defiantly to public criticism over the strike, amid doubt over whether the missiles fired by Israeli air force planes had killed any of their primary targets.On Wednesday, the country’s defence minister, Israel Katz, warned its “long arm will act against its enemies anywhere”.“There is no place where they can hide,” Katz wrote on X, adding: “Everyone who took part in the 7 October massacre will be held fully accountable. Anyone who carries out terror against Israel will be harmed.”The Israeli ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, told Fox News that if the strike had not killed Hamas leaders, it would succeed “next time”.Qatar, a close US ally, has been hosting negotiations aimed at securing a ceasefire in theGazawar, and plays a key role as an intermediary. The Hamas leaders were reported to have been meeting to discuss a new ceasefire proposal put forward by the US president, Donald Trump.In a social media post, Trump insisted he played no role in the attack. “This was a decision made by prime minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me,” he wrote on his Truth Social network. He said his administration had tried to warn Qatar of the attack but was “unfortunately, too late”.Hamas said in a statement that all of its leaders were safe, but five lower-ranked members were reportedly killed. A senior Israeli official admitted on Wednesday that optimism about the success of the strikes was waning.Qatar said one of its security forces was killed in the attack and accused Israel of “state terrorism”.Israel deployed its air power again on Wednesday, with a strike inYemen. Almasirah TV, which is run by the Houthi militia movement that rules much of the country, reported that the defence ministry in the capital, Sana’a, had been hit. Israeli Army Radio said Houthi headquarters and military camps were among the targets.Keir Starmer, the British prime minister,condemned the attack in Qatar, saying Israel violated Qatar’s sovereignty and did “nothing to secure the peace that the UK and so many of our allies are committed to”.Russia and China also condemned the attack, while regional rulers headed to Qatar in a show of solidarity.View image in fullscreenFlames shoot into the air after the Israeli strike on Sana’a on Wednesday.Photograph: APIn Israel, the attacks prompted celebrations but also anxiety among families of the hostages held in Gaza, who said they were fearful for the fate of their loved ones after 23 months of conflict.The war was triggered by a Hamas attack into Israel in October 2023 during which militants killed 1,200, mostly civilians, and abducted 250. Of those, 48 hostages remain in Gaza, but fewer than half are thought to be alive.The Israeli offensive that followed has so far killed more than 64,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, injured more than 150,000 and reduced much of Gaza to ruins.“Why does the prime minister insist on blowing up every small chance for a deal? Why? The people of Israel are tired of this war. End it already and bring everyone back,” said Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan was kidnapped from his kibbutz.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Successive polls have shown broad support in Israel for a deal to end the war and free the hostages, while Netanyahu has been accused of prolonging the conflict for political ends.Qatar has hosted several rounds of indirect Israel-Hamas talks in Doha and helped broker two short-lived truces, with the US and Egypt as fellow mediators.Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at King’s College London, called it a “strike right at the heart of regional mediation” – and one that Washington failed to prevent. “It shows that Trump is unable to actually enforce the policy that he is setting, which was one built around mediation,” he said.2:31‘State terrorism’: Qatari prime minister slams Israel airstrikes in Doha – videoHamas, which has ruled Gaza for nearly two decades but today controls only parts, on Saturday once again said that it would release all hostages if Israel agreed to end the war and withdraw its forces from Gaza.Netanyahu is pushing for a comprehensive deal that would see all of the hostages released at once, Hamas disarming and militant leaders exiled.Amos Nadan, director of the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies, said Tuesday’s strike could have been intended to be a similar move to last year’sassassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanese militia and Hamas ally Hezbollah, which was followed by anIsrael-Lebanon ceasefire two months later.“In Israel … the vast majority of the people now are in favour of ending the war and bringing back the hostages … So that might look like the concluding remarks of the war,” Nadan said.Meanwhile in Sana’a, people said Wednesday’s attack had struck a hideout between two mountains that was used as a command-and-control headquarters. The extent of any damage was not immediately clear.In late August, an Israeli strike on Yemenkilled the Houthi prime minister, Ahmed al-Rahawi.TheHouthis, who are supported by Iran, have attacked vessels in the Red Sea in what they describe as acts of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza and have fired missiles towards Israel, most of which have been intercepted.Explore more on these topicsIsraelQatarHamasYemenMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

According to the BBC, seven members of the gang are in “senior positions overseeing [GHF] sites”.They include the gang’s leader, Johnny “Taz” Mulford, who is a “country team leader” for UG Solutions and had recruited others to work for UG solutions in Gaza. He has the numbers 1095 tattooed across his chest – the year that Pope Urban II launched the first Crusade.Mulford, whose affiliation with GHF was public, accidentally sent an email to the BBC telling other leaders of the group not to comment on inquiries – inadvertently revealing the identities of several other senior Infidels members also working for UG Solutions.One of the contractors, Josh Miller, posted a photograph of contractors in Gaza holding a banner at an aid site that reads: “Make Gaza Great Again.” He has the numbers 1095 tattooed on his fingers.Democrats blast state department for lack of ‘basic oversight’ of controversial Gaza food organizationRead moreGHF’s operations have come under scrutiny as the US and Israeli-backed group has supplanted nearly every other major humanitarian organisation working in the Gaza Strip in what critics have called a deliberate effort to politicise humanitarian aid. The US government has disbursed at least $30m in grants to GHF.Areas near GHF sites have become particularly dangerous for hungry Palestinians seeking food. According to a UN report released in early August, at least 859 Palestinians had been killed near GHF sites. Former employees of UG solutions have told media that contractors at GHF sites have opened fire on aid-seeking Palestinians, even if there was no direct threat.UG Solutions told the BBC that its contractors do not fire on civilians, said Mulford was “trusted and respected”, and that “we stand by his reputation, record, and his contributions to the success of complex missions.” However, the company has previously admitted that warning shots have been used to disperse crowds.“We do not screen for personal hobbies or affiliations unrelated to job performance or security standards. Every team member undergoes comprehensive background checks, and only qualified, vetted individuals are deployed on UG Solutions operations,” UG Solutions told the BBC.In a statement to the Guardian, GHF said: “The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation maintains a strict zero-tolerance policy toward any form of hateful or discriminatory behavior. Mr Mulford has not been involved with GHF since August and we are actively reviewing additional allegations.”AGuardian investigation this week revealedhow four members of one family were shot and killed in a single day by Israeli soldiers recruited from abroad and highlights a pattern in which Israeli troops target unarmed civilians.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Many residents said they would not leave Gaza City regardless of the official order to evacuate, as they did not trust Israel’s promise that al-Mawasi would be safe.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian man walks amid rubble in Gaza City at the site of an Israeli airstrike on an evacuated residential building that was housing displaced Palestinians on 10 September.Photograph: Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersIsrael regularly strikes al-Mawasi despite designating it as a safe zone, and hundreds of thousands of people already live there in tent encampments.“There is no safe zone in the Gaza Strip.

We know they may never let us returnRead moreOver the last five days, the Israeli military has been bombing high-rise buildings in the city, which it claims housedHamasinfrastructure. It has released videos of bombs striking the bottom of the buildings, flattening them in seconds.Residents said they received a call to evacuate the buildings about 20 minutes before they were struck. The bombings left many of them without a place to go and brought renewed pressure to leave the city.Amnesty International condemned the displacement order, saying it compounds the suffering of civilians amid what the human rights organisation has deemed a genocide.“The order issued [on Tuesday] by the Israeli military for the mass displacement of Gaza City residents is cruel, unlawful and further compounds the genocidal conditions of life that Israel is inflicting on Palestinians,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s director for the Middle East and North Africa.Gaza City isin the throes of famine, primarily caused by Israel’s blockade of aid into the territory. Humanitarian organisations have said that a blockaded Gaza City and its accompanying wave of displacement would only exacerbate this famine. They further warned that al-Mawasi, already overburdened with the displaced, did not have the capacity to absorb 1 million more people.Five more people died from starvation in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number who have starved to death in Gaza over the last 23 months to 404.Gaza aid flotilla carrying Greta Thunberg reports second drone attack in 24 hoursRead moreInternational condemnation of Israel’s plans to take over and occupy Gaza City continues to grow. Israel’s unprecedentedstrike on Hamas leaders in Qataron Tuesday, which most states deemed a violation of sovereignty, further increased Israel’s international isolation.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, called for sanctions and a partialtrade suspension against Israelon Wednesday over its conduct in Gaza. The EU is a valuable economic partner for Israel, constituting nearly a third of its trade.“Man-made famine can never be a weapon of war. For the sake of the children, for the sake of humanity, this must stop,” von der Leyen said at the European parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday. Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said her calls for sanctions would embolden Hamas.View image in fullscreenPalestinians at the site of an Israeli airstrike on an evacuated residential building in Gaza City on 10 September.Photograph: Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersIt is unclear if all 27 member states would allow the EU to take the actions that von der Leyen called for, as states such as Germany and Hungary have blocked similar moves in the past.Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 64,600 Palestinians over the last 23 months, with many more whose bodies have not yet been found. Israel launched the war in response to an attack by Hamas-led militants that killed about 1,200 people on 7 October 2023.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaAmnesty InternationalUrsula von der LeyennewsShareReuse this content"

The pledge had 1,200 signers as of Sunday night.On Wednesday, the letter surpassed 3,900 signatories. Among the new signatories are Joaquin Phoenix, Rooney Mara, Emma Stone, James Schamus, Peter Sarsgaard, Lily Gladstone, Nicola Coughlan, Harris Dickinson, Bowen Yang, Guy Pearce, Jonathan Glazer, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Fisher Stevens, Abbi Jacobson, Eric Andre, Elliot Page, Payal Kapadia and Emma D’Arcy, Variety reported.The pledge, shared exclusively with the Guardian,claims to draw inspiration from the cultural boycott that contributed to the end of apartheid in South Africa.It commits signatories not to screen films, appear at or otherwise work with what it considers complicit institutions – including festivals, cinemas, broadcasters and production companies. Examples of complicity include “whitewashing or justifying genocide and apartheid, and/or partnering with the government committing them”.“We answer the call of Palestinian film-makers, who haveurgedthe international film industry to refuse silence, racism, and dehumanisation, as well as to ‘do everything humanly possible’ to end complicity in their oppression,” the statement reads.View image in fullscreenAyo Edebiri is one of the signatories.Photograph: Alessandra Benedetti/Corbis/Getty ImagesThe pledge was published by the group Film Workers for Palestine.Screenwriter David Farr, who is among the signatories, said in a statement: “As the descendant of Holocaust survivors, I am distressed and enraged by the actions of the Israeli state, which has for decades enforced an apartheid system on the Palestinian people whose land they have taken, and which is now perpetuating genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza.“In this context I cannot support my work being published or performed in Israel. The cultural boycott was significant in South Africa. It will be significant this time and in my view should be supported by all artists of conscience.”AnFAQaccompanying the pledge addresses how to determine which film entities are implicated, and states: “Israel’s major film festivals (including but not limited to Jerusalem film festival, Haifa international film festival, Docaviv and TLVFest) continue to partner with the Israeli government while it carries outwhat leading experts have defined as genocideagainst Palestinians in Gaza.“The vast majority of Israeli film production and distribution companies, sales agents, cinemas and other film institutions have never endorsed the full, internationally recognised rights of the Palestinian people,” it adds.The pledge notes that there are “a few Israeli film entities that are not complicit” and advises following “guidelines set by Palestinian civil society”.The film industry workers also clarify in the FAQ that the pledge does not prohibit them from working with Israeli individuals.“The call is for film workers to refuse to work with Israeli institutions that are complicit in Israel’s human rights abuses against the Palestinian people,” the statement reads. “This refusal takes aim at institutional complicity, not identity. There are also 2 million Palestinians with Israeli citizenship, and Palestinian civil society has developed context sensitive guidelines for that community.”The pledge does not explicitly mention the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which is the most prominent civil society effort identifying what it considers complicity with Israel. But it is one of the most prominent cultural boycott efforts announced against Israel since the assault on Gaza started, coming nearly one year aftermore than 1,000 writersannounced a similar pledge.View image in fullscreenYorgos Lanthimos.Photograph: Mickael Chavet/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe effort invokes Filmmakers United Against Apartheid, an initiative founded in 1987 by Jonathan Demme, Martin Scorsese and other prominent film-makers whorefusedto screen their films inapartheid-eraSouth Africa.In a statement responding to the pledge, the Israeli Producers Association said that “the signatories of this petition are targeting the wrong people”.“For decades, we Israeli artists, storytellers, and creators have been the primary voices allowing audiences to hear and witness the complexity of the conflict, including Palestinian narratives and criticism of Israeli state policies. We work with Palestinian creators, telling our shared stories and promoting peace and an end to violence through thousands of films, TV series, and documentaries,” they wrote in a statement sent to the Guardian.“This call for boycott is profoundly misguided. By targeting us – the creators who give voice to diverse narratives and foster dialogue – these signatories are undermining their own cause and attempting to silence us. This shortsighted act seeks to eliminate precisely the collaborative efforts working toward ending violence and achieving peace. We will not allow this and will push back in our efforts to end violence and bring just peace to our region for the benefit of all,” they added.The newcampaign comes amid a growing number of entertainment industry initiatives to protest Israel’s war in Gaza. Earlier this summer, hundreds of actors and film-makers – including Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal, Ralph Fiennes and director Guillermo del Toro –signed an open lettercondemning what they described as the film industry’s silence over Israel’s deadly military campaign in Gaza.Activists hope to shift Venice film festival focus on to crisis in GazaRead moreMany of the same figures who have signed the new pledge were alsoamong the hundredsof Screen Actors Guild members who, last year, urged union leadership to protect members from being blacklisted over their views on Palestine. More recently, the Norwegian Actors’ Equity Association recommended its members refuse to work with certain Israeli cultural institutions.Last summer,Variety reportedthat more than 65 Palestinian film-makers also signed a letter in which they accused Hollywood of “dehumanising” Palestinians on screen over decades.In that letter, the film-makerscalled ontheir international colleagues “to stand against working with production companies that are deeply complicit in dehumanising Palestinians, or whitewashing and justifying Israel’s crimes against us”.Last week,The Voice of Hind Rajab, a new film about a five-year-old girl killed by Israeli forces in Gaza last year, received a 23-minute standing ovationafter its premiereat theVenice film festival. Brad Pitt, Jonathan Glazer, Phoenix, Rooney Mara and Alfonso Cuarón were among the executive producers on the film.Explore more on these topicsFilmIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Guardian’s reporter in Gaza describes the dilemma facing her family and others, many hungry, penniless and without transportByMalak A Tanteshin Gaza CityWed 10 Sep 2025 09.57 EDTLast modified on Wed 10 Sep 2025 19.12 EDTShareThe ninth of September is my sister Enas’s birthday, so we were happy this morning, drinking coffee as a family and telling jokes, until we saw the leaflets dropping down telling us to evacuate. So now, instead of preparing biscuits and cakes to celebrate, we are packing for another displacement.TheIsraeli army’s plan to occupy Gaza Citysent me back to memories of the early days of the war: the tension, the terror and the psychological pressure. I am afraid the cycle of displacement will repeat itself again.We have stayed in 10 places since we left our home in Beit Lahia, northernGaza, at the start of the war. A single phrase keeps echoing in my thoughts: “I don’t want to.”I don’t want to live through that again. I don’t want to return to the south: even though it is part of Gaza, we felt like strangers there, our hearts aching for the scent of our own soil.View image in fullscreenPalestinians evacuate Gaza City towards southern areas of the coastal Gaza Strip on 10 September.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty ImagesMy mind shifts to memories of the suffering we endured in the south, living in tents, the heat of summer, the cold of winter, the struggle to secure food and water, the difficulty of accessing electricity and the internet.The first Friday of the war we fled without knowing our destination, consumed by fear, taking only small bags packed quickly with light clothes and some basic essentials. It was an extreme time, when we lived minute to minute in total confusion.This time we knew we must prepare for all possibilities. So two weeks ago my father decided to go south to look for a shelter for us, in case we would be displaced again. He set off on his old bicycle, carrying just a bag with some food and water.View image in fullscreenDestruction from Israeli strikes in central Beit Lahia, Tantesh’s home town, photographed in January 2025.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianThe first thing he noticed was the lack of transport. There are very few cars still operating due to a lack of fuel – a litre now costs 500 shekels ($148), 100 times the normal price. There are even fewer animal-drawn carts on the roads, because most horses and donkeys have died from starvation or exhaustion. Most streets are now just a mix of sand, rubble and stones.Everyone spent their savings on food when famine pushed prices unimaginably high. So most people cannot afford to take anything with them, but if they are displaced without their few essential belongings such as bedding and cooking pots, they won’t have money to replace them either.MapWhen my father reached Deir al-Balah he couldn’t find anywhere for our family. Al-Mawasi is a strip of land just a kilometre wide and it is already packed with displaced people from Rafah and Khan Younis. As he searched, he kept wondering where all the people now in northern Gaza were meant to go.He ended the search with a visit to an old friend from our home town of Beit Lahia who is still in our old displacement area in eastern Mawasi. Abu Ahmed, 46, had decided to stay in the south when we returned home during the ceasefire.But within half an hour, four heavy airstrikes hit a couple of hundred metres away, in the eastern outskirts of the “humanitarian area”. These attacks filled my father with fear. How can the Israeli army tell us to evacuate Gaza City for our safety while it bombs the very places it wants us to go?View image in fullscreenA large number of Palestinians gather to receive food in al-Mawasi.Photograph: Abed Rahim Khatib/Anadolu/Getty ImagesAbu Ahmed told my dad about at least 10 people he knew who had been killed by Israeli attacks in just a couple of days. His neighbour died trying to find a phone signal on top of the same hill we used to climb when we needed to get online.A dawn airstrike killed twin brothers who were classmates of his 10-year-old son, along with their parents, the previous day. Five workers at a nearby farm, one of a handful still operating in Gaza, were also targeted.My father left the area quickly, fearing for his life, and returned north. After two full days of an impossible search for a safe place that doesn’t exist, he returned exhausted, his clothes dirty, his face burned brown by the sun.I can never forget the joy on the day in January when we returned to the north during the brief ceasefire, a feeling still engraved in my heart. I remember the refreshing exhaustion, the comfort that filled me when I took myfirst step back on northern soil.View image in fullscreenMalak Tantesh and her father, Amjed Tantesh, in the ruins of their home in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianView image in fullscreenTantesh surveys the destruction in northern Gaza.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianView image in fullscreenTantesh with family members in northern Gaza.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianAt that time, we as civilians tried to bring life back to our demolished town, Beit Lahia. We created new memories, with serious attempts to repair the destruction caused by the Israeli invasion. It felt like being born again.But then war resumed and with it displacement, hunger, fear and suffering. A tank shell killed my dearest uncle Bahjat, 57, when he and my father were collecting some of our possessions from an old shelter, our family’s worst loss so far.View image in fullscreenPalestinians returning to north Gaza in January 2025 during the brief ceasefire.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianMy father survived the attack miraculously unharmed but we could not stay in Beit Lahia for long. Forced out by the approaching bombs and shelling, we had to move to Gaza City.We rented an apartment, so our living conditions were better than those of hundreds of thousands of people with regards to water, electricity and the internet, but we shared their hunger as food vanished from the markets.That hardship eased for us after the crossings were reopened and some aid and commercial goods were allowed back in, but the prices were not affordable for everyone. The most vulnerable didn’t taste these privileges.View image in fullscreenBuns baked in the Tantesh family’s Gaza City apartment when sugar became available again.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianThen came the escalation of attacks on eastern neighbourhoods of Gaza City and news of the Israeli plan to fully occupy it and displace all residents to the south. People were drowning in questions that have no answers.Even if they want to leave, people are too poor and weak. Thousands of families are surviving on just one meal a day, usually lentils. If they cannot even afford food, how can they possibly afford the cost of displacement, which requires at least 2,000 shekels just for transport?Our return to the north felt like an impossible dream come true. We were still displaced but could find the warmth of home in the streets and alleys of Gaza City. We were among relatives and friends, surrounded by clothing shops, cafes and the few remaining beautiful places. None of this exists in the south, where all you see are tents, with no space to escape the harsh and painful reality.View image in fullscreenThe view over Beit Lahia from the roof of Tantesh’s grandfather’s house in February 2025.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianIf we are displaced again, we know they may never let us return. We feel it strongly. They will turn what remained of Gaza City into ashes, as they did with my city, Beit Lahia, and the surrounding northern towns of Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun.They will erase it from existence, destroying every trace of life, human, animal and tree. They will turn it all into grey rubble. When these thoughts cross our minds, we are overcome with grief and anger, frustrated with a world that could stop this but chooses instead to watch from afar.We dreamed of being asked to return to our towns and neighbourhoods instead of going south. We hoped for a ceasefire to end this nightmare once and for all. We prayed for a miracle to foil the Israeli plan. Yet, once again, we are packing to leave.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the proportion using forceps or ventouse cups has fallen over the same period, from 12.3% to 11.1%.Dr Shuby Puthussery, an associate professor in maternal and child health at the University of Bedfordshire, said: “It’s worrying that over 50% of births involved medical intervention. But it’s linked to a broader demographic trend.“We see a rather worrying trend of births to [older] women increasing year by year, along with significant increases in factors such as obesity, maternal diabetes and pre-existing medical conditions, leading to more complex medically assisted births, especially among women from ethnic minority groups and those living in poverty.”Better access to antenatal care, especially scans, would help detect problems earlier and reduce the risk of mothers needing medical assistance while in labour, she said.Prof Asma Khalil, the vice-president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), disagreed that a caesarean increases the risk faced by women.“Caesarean births are common and the steady increase isn’t necessarily a cause for concern as long as future services are well-prepared to adapt and ensure they have the right staffing, training and facilities to manage increasingly complex births.“The caesarean birthrate in England has steadily increased over the past decade. One factor in this is the increasing proportion of pregnancies that are complex.“We are seeing national rising rates of obesity and people choosing to have children at a later stage in their life, both of which can increase the chance of complications.”The report said: “There are risks and benefits to both vaginal and caesarean modes of birth, and the reasons for choosing a caesarean birth, planned or unplanned, can include physical or psychological benefits.“While unnecessary interventions may lead to adverse outcomes, it is important to note that there is no ‘ideal’ rate for births by caesarean.”In 2023, a total of 23.1% of births were emergency caesareans and 16.4% were planned.The NMPA is a joint piece of work by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Royal College of Midwives, Royal College of Paediatrics and ChildHealthand researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.It confirmed that fertility rates had declined sharply over recent years. The number of births in England and Wales has been falling steadily since 2012, and 2023 saw the lowest number since 1977. The fertility rate in England and Wales is now 1.44 children per woman.Scotland recorded its lowest-ever total fertility in 2023. The rate there has fallen to just 1.3 babies per woman.NHS England was asked for comment.Explore more on these topicsWomen's healthNHSWomenHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

It had been expected to employ about 800 people overall, including 180 scientists.As part of its U-turn, Merck, known as MSD in Europe, will vacate laboratories at the nearby London Bioscience Innovation Centre, which hosts more than 60 life science companies, and the neighbouring Francis Crick Institute by the end of 2025, with the loss of about 125 scientific jobs.The New Jersey-based company said it would move the research operations to other sites. It is unclear where in the world it would be, but pharmaceutical companies are under pressure from Donald Trump to invest more in the US. The company declined to provider further details.In a statement, MSD announced “plans to discontinue discovery research operations in the UK and that it no longer plans to occupy the Belgrove House site at King’s Cross”.“This … reflects the challenges of the UK not making meaningful progress towards addressing the lack of investment in the life science industry and the overall undervaluation of innovative medicines and vaccines by successive UK governments,” it said.MSD had previously said the research centre would build on the company’s 100-year heritage in the UK, close to London’s Knowledge Quarter and its Moorgate headquarters. It will keep its HQ and a large animal health site in Milton Keynes.Lengthy negotiations between the government and the industry over the cost of medicines for the UK broke down last month. Under the voluntary pricing and access scheme, companies agree to pay back a certain amount of revenue they make from newer, branded drugs. In 2023, the rebate rate rose to 23.5%, which compares with 5.7% in France and 7% in Germany.Richard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said: “This is a real blow to the UK’s life sciences ambitions. No one wants to hear that successful and innovative companies like MSD are reducing their investment and footprint in the UK.”Referring to a recent survey from Deloitte, and the UK’s trade deal with the US, a government spokesperson said: “The UK has become the most attractive place to invest in the world, but we know there is more work to do. Through our life sciences sector plan, we’re taking decisive action to further unlock innovation, drive investment and boost growth.”The news came as a report showed that the UK had lost ground to rivals in the global race for pharmaceutical investment and research.Investment in life sciences research and development (R&D) in the UK has underperformed against global trends since 2018, according tothe studyfrom the ABPI and the consulting firm PwC.It said a significant slowdown began in 2020, when the rate of growth in R&D investment fell to 1.9% annually, down from 6.3% in the three preceding years and lagging behind the global average of 6.6%. R&D investment by the pharmaceutical industry even fell in 2023, the final year of the study, by nearly £100m.At £795m, investment by foreign life sciences companies in the UK was 58% lower in 2023 than in 2017, when it stood at £1.9bn. This meant that the country declined in global rankings from second place in 2017 and 2021 to seventh place in 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It ranked eighth for late-stage industry trials in 2023, down from fourth in 2017, although there were “small signs of improvement” in 2023, according to the report.Rippon Ubhi, who runs Sanofi’s UK and Ireland business and the French company’s speciality care division, said: “The findings in this report paint a concerning picture for UK patients and our economy.“The UK is increasingly being viewed as ‘uninvestable’ in global boardrooms due to unprecedented [NHS]clawback ratesand restrictive patient access to medicines. While other countries are actively investing in innovative medicines for patients, the UK is falling behind.”The UK head of the Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis, Johan Kahlström, has also said high costs meansthe UK is “largely uninvestable,”, while the health secretary, Wes Streeting, has pledged that he will not allow firms to “rip off” taxpayers.The government has set a target to position the UK as the leading life sciences economy in Europe by 2030 and third globally by 2035, while the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said the UK is at theforefrontof developments in the sector.Torbett said: “The UK has a world-class science base and the potential to lead globally in developing the next generation of medicines and vaccines. But without a more competitive environment for investment, we risk losing out to other countries making bold moves to attract internationally mobile investment.”Only 37% of new medicines are made fully available for their licensed indications in the UK, compared with 90% in Germany. ABPI data shows that more than 60 medicines did not launch in the UK or were delayed between 2019-20 and 2022-23.Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryHealthResearch and developmentScience policyInvestingFinancial sectornewsShareReuse this content"

He denied there was any famine and blamed the high civilian death toll onHamasplacing missiles in living rooms.He offered no apology for theattack on Hamas’s leadership in Dohaon Tuesday, accusing Qatar of being allies of Hamas rather than mediators.Downing Street said Starmer “condemned Israel’s action in Doha yesterday as completely unacceptable. He said the strikes were a flagrant violation of a key partner’s sovereignty and do nothing to secure the peace we all desperately want to see”.Turning to Gaza, he reiterated his huge concern and implored Israel to change course. They must stop thehuman-made faminefrom worsening further by letting aid in and halting their offensive operations.”No 10 defended the decision for Starmer and the foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, to meet Herzog, and said one goal was to persuade him that Israel needed to do more to evacuate injured children and potential students from Gaza to the UK.View image in fullscreenProtesters gathered outside Chatham House during Isaac Herzog’s visit.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianIn the Commons, the meeting was widely condemned by Labour MPs angry the government is not taking a tougher line with Israel, which some described as a “rogue state”.Herzog’s trip has been billed as a private visit to support the Jewish community in the UK.He said of his encounter with Starmer: “It was a meeting between allies, but it was a tough meeting.”He added: “Things were said that were tough and strong, and clearly we can argue, because when allies meet they can argue. We are both democracies, we both understand the threat from the jihadists.”Herzog condemned the British intention to recognise a Palestinian state, saying: “We believe that a unilateral resolution regarding a Palestinian state will be adverse and negatively affect any future process, because it will be dangerous.“It won’t help one Palestinian, one hostage, and can be adversely interpreted by Hamas.”He also said he rejected “out of hand” comments by Wes Streeting that Israel has to answer allegations of war crimes and genocide.“Even a recent UK report said that Israel is not carrying out, God forbid, any genocide, and we reject it out of hand,” he said. “It’s very easy to blame Israel without understanding the facts or without seeing it for themselves.”Herzog did admit that the food distribution system set up by the Israeli government and the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had not worked, adding Israel was in the middle of a major overhaul of food distribution.He also denied it was an Israeli plan to expel Palestinians from Gaza, urging Europeans not to take remarks made by cabinet members Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich as if they were Israeli policy.“Israel is a democracy with as far-reaching free speech as imaginable, but that does not reflect in any way the Israeli policy,” he said. “This is absolutely not the Israeli position or intention. Israel has made it clear it does not want to expel anyone.”Herzog tried to downplay plans to annex most of the West Bank, saying they were not going to be implemented tomorrow.Rejecting a two-state solution, he said both sides were too traumatised to consider such a step, and accused Hamas of trying to drive the region and the world crazy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The crowd ​chant​ed “lock him up”​ throughout Herzog’s speech.Rachel, a 20-year-old law student who held a “Herzog to the Hague” sign, called for ​his arrest and said it was “disgusting” that he had been granted a meeting with Starmer.“However​, it’s not surprising. We know that this government, time and time again, has accepted and welcomed war criminals,” she said​.“The government knows that so much of the British public do not stand for this. We do not stand for the actions of Herzog and they knew they had to do this in secret, because we would have been there to stop it.”Jacqueline Namon, who travelled from Reading to London for the protest, said she felt the government had rolled out the red carpet for Herzog.“Whatever I’m doing during the day, I’m thinking about Gaza. It’s just in my head the whole time. It’s stressful but I can’t believe it’s just getting worse and worse. I can’t understand how the powers that be are behaving the way they are behaving.”In an earlier briefing to the media, Herzog insisted that the Qatar strike was designed to bring about an end to the war. “We targeted those who refused to accept the deal – primarily Khalil al-Hayya, who was the head of Hamas,” he said.“He kept on being the objector. He refused adamantly to get to a deal. He kept on saying ‘no’, or ‘yes, but’ – and the ‘but’ was impossible to overcome.“His conditions could never be met. He was one of the instigators and perpetrators of 7 October, and I guess the Americans can confirm it.”Al-Hayya was initially reported to have been killed in the strike, but Israeli officials have since suggested that this may not be the case. However, his son, Humam, and Jihad Labad, the director of his office, have been confirmed as being among the six people killed.In a statement released after the meeting, No 10 said: “The leaders agreed that the hostages who were cruelly ripped by Hamas from their families nearly two years ago must be released.“The prime minister also shared his condolences for the horrifyingterror attack in Jerusalemon Monday, making clear that the UK stands against the abhorrent terrorism Israel has endured since 7 October.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerIsraelIsrael-Gaza warHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

A source close to Powell said the briefings were “frankly sexist” and were “wrong and stupid”.Those who attended a hustings hosted by the “red wall” group of MPs said Powell had won over a significant number in the room, many of whom had been expecting to back Phillipson. The soft-left Tribune group also voted to back Powell.“She is definitely becoming the magnet for those of us who want a change,” one backer said.Phillipson is the runaway favourite with MPs, according to the nominations and has been making the case to MPs about her experience as a north-east England MP on the frontline of the red wall and the battle against Reform UK.“We have a broader cross-section of the PLP, MPs from every wing, and considerably more new MPs,” one source close to Phillipson said.Allies of Phillipson said she had been dismayed that some rival camps were resorting to deeply personalised briefings in the media, including that she was “robotic”.Most frontbenchers are expected to give Phillipson their backing, though one minister complained of mixed messaging from No 10 over whether they were officially expected to do so. A source close to Ed Miliband said it was “nonsense” that he was encouraging MPs to back Powell, his former chief of staff.Powell, who as a recently ousted cabinet minister is likely to pick up the votes of those disgruntled with the leadership, is known in the party as a formidable organiser.She is leading the race for votes among centrist and soft-left MPs who have been disillusioned with Starmer, ahead of Thornberry, who had launched her deputy leadership campaign with explicit criticism of Starmer’s handling of the economy, welfare and the Gaza war, but who failed to pick up many endorsements.MPs are thought to be wary of nominating another London MP. Thornberry is Starmer’s constituency neighbour in Islington.McGovern dropped out of the race before Wednesday’s nominations were tallied, saying it was clear momentum had shifted. Earlier she had said it was vital Labour took the argument to the far right to champion an inclusive and progressive Britain, saying: “The progressive cause is at risk of being lost unless we can tell that story.”Her candidacy had caused some confusion among moderate MPs who had been unsure whether to back her or Phillipson. Labour MPs privately voiced despair on Tuesday over the chaotic nature of the race, with hustings cancelled because of tube strikes and issues with room bookings. The main hustings for MPs on Wednesday night was switched to a virtual meeting.Ribeiro-Addy, on the left of the party, told the Guardian that the deputy leadership race was being suffocated by anti-democratic rules that prevented a wider debate. She said it would ultimately drive more Labour members away by preventing a proper contest.“We are losing the people that win us elections, that crowd the streets: the activists. They are completely disenfranchised. And what I’m trying to do by standing is showing them that there’s still a place in this party for them,” she said.“Some people think that us having this conversation is distracting from government and that we shouldn’t be debating amongst ourselves, and it looks like disunity. And I actually think if it’s done in the right way, it makes us look more mature.”Many Labour MPs privately told the Guardian they were very unwilling to nominate anyone from the left in order to broaden the debate, given their experience with Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, which was unpopular with many MPs.“We’ve tried broadening the debate, now I want to try narrowing it,” one said.Explore more on these topicsLabour party deputy leadershipLabourBridget PhillipsonLucy PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

Kirk is one of the highest-profile allies of the US president, and his organization, Turning Point USA, has helped turn out voters for Trump and otherRepublicans. He is also known for his inflammatory, often racist and xenophobic commentary, particularly on college campuses.The shooting comes as a series of incidents over the past year show an increased level of violence related to political disagreements or intended to achieve political goals.Trump facedtwo assassination attemptsin 2024. Last December, a shootertargeted and killedthe head of United Healthcare. Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro’s home wasburned in an arson attackin April. Judges and elected officials report increased threats and harassment. Several instances of violence have stemmed from opposition to the Gaza war. In June, a man dressed as a police officer shot and killed a Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband, and wounded another state lawmaker and his wife. A gunman attacked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in August, killing a police officer.Surveys have shown increased acceptance of using violence for political aims across party spectrums. Robert Pape, who directs the Chicago Project on Security and Threats,wrote in the New York Timesthat a survey his team conducted in May was its “most worrisome yet”. “About 40 percent of Democrats supported the use of force to remove Mr. Trump from the presidency, and about 25 percent of Republicans supported the use of the military to stop protests against Mr. Trump’s agenda. These numbers more than doubled since last fall, when we asked similar questions,” he wrote.“We’re becoming more and more of a powder keg,” Pape told the Guardian on Wednesday. Pape calls the current moment an “era of violent populism”.US lawmakers unite to condemn Charlie Kirk shooting: ‘Reject political violence’Read moreCondemnations of the shooting came from across the political spectrum. Pape has long argued that politicians need to speak out against violence, especially if it’s aligned with their own team.These condemnations are “extremely helpful here as we go forward. It won’t stop everything, but it helps to stop the snowball,” he said.Hasan Piker, the progressive streamer who was scheduled to debate Kirk later this month, said on his livestream on Wednesday that it was a “terrifying incident”.“The reverberation of people seeking out vengeance in the aftermath of this violent, abhorrent incident is going to be genuinely worrisome,” he said.The aftermath of Kirk’s death could include increased violence and retaliation, with some rightwing figures already calling for retribution.Libs of TikTok, the rightwing X account, put simply: “THIS IS WAR.”Explore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingDonald TrumpRepublicansGun crimeUS crimeUtahFar right (US)analysisShareReuse this content"

The administration has argued that Trump is able to fire Fed governors “for cause” and appoint replacements.Trump is out to end the Fed’s autonomy. Here’s how he’s trying to get his wayRead moreTrump has spent monthsattacking the Fed, where most policymakers – including Cook – have so far defied his calls for interest rate cuts. He has spoken of rapidly building “a majority” on the central bank’s board, calling into question the future of its longstanding independence from political oversight.Trump moved to fire Cook after one of his allies, Bill Pulte, whom he tapped to lead the US Federal Housing Finance Agency, alleged she had claimed two different properties as primary residences when obtaining mortgages in 2021.“How can this woman be in charge of interest rates if she is allegedly lying to help her own interest rates?” Pulte wrote on X. He referred the case to the Department of Justice for investigation.After Cook declined to resign, Trump tried to remove her from the Fed’s board. The justice department isnow lookinginto the allegations of mortgage fraud.In a court filing, Cook’s attorneys insisted she “did not ever commit mortgage fraud” as they outlined their case.Multiple federal agencies were provided details of Cook’s mortgage arrangements when she was first nominated, by Joe Biden, to join the Fed’s board in 2022, according to her representatives. “The Government has long known about the alleged facial inconsistencies in Governor Cook’s financial documents,” the filing said.On one background check form, for example, Cook said that she had listed one property in Michigan as a primary residence and another in Georgia as a second home.On a separate questionnaire, she listed both homes as her “present” residence; the Michigan property as her “current permanent residence”; and a third property, in Massachusetts, as both a present residence, but also a second home and rental property, she said.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveDonald TrumpUS economyTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, Ellison’s lead was short-lived as the stock closed at $328, a rise of 36% valuing Ellison’s shareholding at $378bn and putting Musk back ahead.The pair sit comfortably ahead of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos.Ellison, 81, also has other sources of wealth, including a stake in electric carmaker Tesla, where Musk is chief executive, a sailing team, the Indian Wells Open tennis tournament, and an island in Hawaii, according to Bloomberg.Musk, an antagonist to various figures in the worlds of business and politics, has a close relationship with Ellison – who is often described as a mentor to the South Africa-born tech entrepreneur.Ellison sat on the board of Tesla between 2018 and 2022 and put $1bn intoMusk’s purchase of Twitter–since rebranded as X. According to Walter Isaacson’s biography of Musk, when the Tesla CEO asked Ellison to invest in Twitter, Ellison said he would put in a billion dollars or “whatever you recommend”. Musk is a frequent visitor to Ellison’s Hawaiian island, Lanai, according to the book.Ellison is also a supporter of Donald Trump and has regularly appeared alongside the US president at the White House, includingthe launch of the Stargate projectto invest $500bn in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US.

I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!”EU officials, led by the bloc’s sanctions chief, David O’Sullivan, participated in the discussions in Washington, which featured senior US treasury officials.News of the discussions came as Mexico announced it would raise its tariffs on automobiles fromChinaand other Asian countries to 50%, from a prior level of 20%.The economy minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said the move was intended to protect jobs in Mexico.The pressure on the EU from Trump comes at a pivotal moment for his tariff policies. In May, theUS trade court ruledthat the tariffs “exceed any authority granted to the president”. A federal appeals courtupheldthat ruling at the end of August, and the case is now heading to the supreme court.The supreme court hearing is set to hear the case in the first week in November and the tariffs remain in place ahead of its ruling. But the uncertain future of Trump’s tariffs has complicated the administration’s negotiations with trading nations and threatens to leave the US with a huge bill should the court rule against them.On Sunday, Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, said he was “confident” that the administration would win its case at the supreme court, althoughlegal experts are dividedand the lower courts have consistently ruled against them.Bessent has said the US would have to refund tens of billions of dollars in tariffs should the court rule them illegal. “We would have to give a refund on about half the tariffs, which would be terrible for the treasury,” Bessent said in an interview Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press.Explore more on these topicsRussiaDonald TrumpUkraineTariffsIndiaChinaEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

The share price rose by 2.1% by Wednesday afternoon as investors were cheered by the cost savingsBooming sales of GLP-1 diabetes and obesity drugs in recent years had helped Novo Nordisk rise to becomeEurope’s most valuable company, but it lost the title in March, only briefly regaining it in June.Studies have shown that Eli Lilly’sMounjaro is more effective than Wegovyin reducing weight. Both can be prescribed by NHS doctors to patients with high clinical need. Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic injection is also available on the NHS, as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. It can be prescribed by private doctors “off label” for weight loss.The drugmaker estimates that the job cuts will save it 8bn kroner (£930m) a year by 2026. However, they will cost 8bn kroner in one-off restructuring charges, prompting the company to cut its operating profit growth forecast for 2025 from 10%-16% to 4%-10%.They are the first major move by Doustdar,an Iranian-born Austrian-American businessmanwho took over last month from Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, who had led the company since 2017 andhinted at redundancieslast month.“It is always difficult to see talented and valued colleagues go, but we are convinced that this is the right thing to do for the long-term success of Novo Nordisk,” Doustdar said. “We need a shift in our mindset and approach so that we can be faster and more agile.”Novo Nordisk has also had disappointing results for its new obesity drug, CagriSema, whichfailed to outperform Eli Lilly’s Mounjaroin weight loss in a late-stage clinical trial.Sales have also been damaged by “compounding” in the US, where pharmacies make up weight-loss medications from ingredients, a practice that was allowed during drug shortages but was officially ended by the US regulator recently.Jørgensen said last month that the generic, copycat market had “equal size to our business” and that compounded versions of Wegovy were sold at a “much lower price point”.Bank of America analysts said they now expect Novo Nordisk to issue a fourth profit warning when it reports third-quarter results in November, doubting the company can meet the top end of its sales forecast.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Uncertainty over American tariffs has also been a risk that continues to cast a shadow over the industry. By becoming a leaner machine, Novo hopes to redirect more funding to R&D to bolster its pipeline of products.”Over the past five years, Novo Nordisk went on a hiring spree, raising employee numbers by 75% as its performance soared because of the global popularity of its weight-loss drugs, which users inject themselves with once a week.Eli Lilly paused UK ordersfor Mounjaro last month beforehefty price risesacross all doses from 1 September, to prevent inappropriate stockpiling of medicines, it said.It increased the UK list price by up to 170% depending on the dose, although a discount to suppliers has been secured that should limit the impact on consumers, amid aWhite House pushto get drugmakers to raise prices in Europe to enable them to cut high US prices.Mounjaro users were dismayed at the news, worried they would be unable to continue with the medication.Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryJob lossesHealthDenmarkEuropeTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

ObsceneArwa MahdawiTesla’s board is dangling a gargantuan payout in front of its chief. Is it a manipulative ploy or a desperate stunt?Wed 10 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTShareBribery is generally unethical and often illegal, but also quite effective. When my four-year-old is acting up and ignoring my increasingly desperate pleas for her to get dressed, leave the playground or do something else very important, I have, on occasion, resorted to desperate promises of ice-cream. Obviously, I know it’s counterproductive to respond to suboptimal behaviour with sugar-based bribes. But sometimes you are exhausted and just need a short-term win. The ice-cream always delivers.It seems trying to motivate a four-year-old is not much different from trying to keep a petulant 54-year-old tech mogul in line.On Friday, Tesla’s board of directors rolled out a pay package proposal for CEO Elon Musk that could, if he plays his cars right, turn the billionaire into the world’s first trillionaire. In a section of Tesla’s latest stock market update that began: “Yes, you read that correctly”, the board outlines everything Musk has to do to get his hands on that performance-based trillion. Which, to be fair, is a lot. Tesla needs to reach a market cap of $8.5tn, eight times its current value, in 10 years to get Musk the payout. Many analysts believe Tesla is alreadyovervalued, so this is no small task.Still, a challenge and reward of this magnitude seem a cunning way to harness the power of Musk’s oversized ego. If anything can get Musk to stop stoking culture wars and fathering children, in order to focus on the companies he is supposed to be running, it may well be the prospect of becoming the world’s first trillionaire.Gavin Newsom is taking the fight to Trump – but for whom is he fighting? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreEfficacy aside, a potential trillion-dollar pay package in a world where almost 700 million people live onless than $2.15 a dayis obscene. Making it even more enraging is Musk’s handy knack for failing upwards. The billionaire’s stint running the Department of Government Efficacy (Doge), his short-lived pet project, left chaos and a trail of destruction in its wake. Global health officials have said, for example, that Doge’s USAID cuts have led to cases ofbabies being born with HIV infectionsbecause mothers could not get access to medication, and have warned the cuts could reverse decades of progress. Cuts to educational programmes for low-income families will similarly havelong-term ramifications. And for what? APolitico analysislast month found Doge saved less than 5% of what it claimed in cancelled contracts.Musk is nowdeeply unpopularand a lot of people want to see him get his just deserts. Tesla, meanwhile, just wants him to get back to work in the private sector and is dangling the prospect of the biggest ice-cream the world has ever seen.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The report claims that hypothermia experiments were carried out on up to 300 prisoners and that between 80 and 90 died as a result of beingkept in freezing conditions – baths of water containing blocks of ice – for hours on end.The Dachau camp, just a few miles from Munich, opened in 1933, less than two months after Adolf Hitler became chancellor. It was first used to incarcerate political prisoners, but during the second world war it became a concentration camp where more than 41,000 Jewish people and other prisoners were slaughtered before US troops liberated it on 29 April 1945.Swiss-based Weleda, known for its bestseller Skin Food range of moisturisers, and other products includingsalt toothpaste and citrus deodorant, responded to Sudrow’s report this week by promising a “complete clarification” of its history.Founded in 1921 by a group including the Austrian “spiritual scientist” and self-proclaimed clairvoyant Rudolf Steiner, Weleda says its products are still based on the principles of anthroposophy, a combination of holistic spiritual and scientific philosophy established through Steiner’s teachings. On its website Weleda explainsanthroposophyand its commitment to it as “a worldwide research method that explores spirituality with science”. As a company, it says, it views “humans, society and nature as a holistic whole”.During her five-year research project, Sudrow, who has published extensively on issues related to the Nazis, says she found close ties between Weleda and the SS-controlled German Research Institute for Nutrition and Food (DVA) from at least 1941 until the end of the second world war.View image in fullscreenA visitor to Dachau stands at the main gate on International Holocaust Remembrance Day in January.Photograph: Angelika Warmuth/ReutersIt was allegedly in return for herb and other plant products from the DVA that Weleda gave Rascher the cream that it had promoted to the Nazi leadership from 1940 as a product which would be useful for the German military, especially on the eastern front, claiming that its use would make amputations from frostbite unnecessary.Sudrow says her work also shows close personal connections betweenWeleda and the SS at Dachau. The SS was home to a strong network of anthroposophists, despite some Nazi officials viewing the movement as an ideological threat to the party.The former head of Weleda’s medicinal plant garden, Frank Lippert, worked for the SS from 1941 and joined it in 1942, Sudrow found. After the war he had a contract with Weleda to work as a consultant, her research showed. It claims he tried to continue his research on the plantation at Dachau, but was forbidden from doing so by US military authorities, and continued until his death in 1949 to draw on his research findings based on the experiments he had worked on at the camp.Sudrow said that her findings had shaken her own belief in biodynamic products, which remain popular in the German speaking world and beyond. “How should we as consumers behave in relation to biodynamic products when we know what happened here in the Dachau concentration camp? I believe that it’s necessary to throw light on this,” she toldDer Spiegel.In astatementpublished on its German-language site,Weleda said: “As Weleda we condemn the atrocities of the Nazi regime in the strongest possible terms. Fascism, antisemitism, racism, or rightwing extremist ideology have no place in our midst.”It added that as a company it was “committed to transparently reviewing our history”, and said it had “already actively provided several renowned historians with full access to our archives over several years”.It pointed to the 2024 publication on its website of areportinto its past which it had commissioned from the Society for Corporate History (GUG) in 2023.In this, the cream delivered to the SS by Weleda is mentioned. However, it says it is unclear whether or not Rascher used it for human experiments or whether it had ever been his intention to do so.It said Lippert’s work at Dachau had “in no way been connected to his earlier work at Weleda”.The statement concluded: “We want a complete clarification of our history. Weleda is a cosmopolitan company operating in 50 countries in the world and we stand for tolerance, diversity and humanity.”Weleda did not respond to a request for comment.This article was amended on 10 September 2025. Dachau was a concentration camp, not a death camp, as an earlier version said. Also the 41,000 people who died there were not only Jewish people but included other prisoners.Explore more on these topicsSecond world warSwitzerlandNazismRetail industryGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It had been expected to employ about 800 people overall, including 180 scientists.As part of its U-turn, Merck, known as MSD in Europe, will vacate laboratories at the nearby London Bioscience Innovation Centre, which hosts more than 60 life science companies, and the neighbouring Francis Crick Institute by the end of 2025, with the loss of about 125 scientific jobs.The New Jersey-based company said it would move the research operations to other sites. It is unclear where in the world it would be, but pharmaceutical companies are under pressure from Donald Trump to invest more in the US. The company declined to provider further details.In a statement, MSD announced “plans to discontinue discovery research operations in the UK and that it no longer plans to occupy the Belgrove House site at King’s Cross”.“This … reflects the challenges of the UK not making meaningful progress towards addressing the lack of investment in the life science industry and the overall undervaluation of innovative medicines and vaccines by successive UK governments,” it said.MSD had previously said the research centre would build on the company’s 100-year heritage in the UK, close to London’s Knowledge Quarter and its Moorgate headquarters. It will keep its HQ and a large animal health site in Milton Keynes.Lengthy negotiations between the government and the industry over the cost of medicines for the UK broke down last month. Under the voluntary pricing and access scheme, companies agree to pay back a certain amount of revenue they make from newer, branded drugs. In 2023, the rebate rate rose to 23.5%, which compares with 5.7% in France and 7% in Germany.Richard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said: “This is a real blow to the UK’s life sciences ambitions. No one wants to hear that successful and innovative companies like MSD are reducing their investment and footprint in the UK.”Referring to a recent survey from Deloitte, and the UK’s trade deal with the US, a government spokesperson said: “The UK has become the most attractive place to invest in the world, but we know there is more work to do. Through our life sciences sector plan, we’re taking decisive action to further unlock innovation, drive investment and boost growth.”The news came as a report showed that the UK had lost ground to rivals in the global race for pharmaceutical investment and research.Investment in life sciences research and development (R&D) in the UK has underperformed against global trends since 2018, according tothe studyfrom the ABPI and the consulting firm PwC.It said a significant slowdown began in 2020, when the rate of growth in R&D investment fell to 1.9% annually, down from 6.3% in the three preceding years and lagging behind the global average of 6.6%. R&D investment by the pharmaceutical industry even fell in 2023, the final year of the study, by nearly £100m.At £795m, investment by foreign life sciences companies in the UK was 58% lower in 2023 than in 2017, when it stood at £1.9bn. This meant that the country declined in global rankings from second place in 2017 and 2021 to seventh place in 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It ranked eighth for late-stage industry trials in 2023, down from fourth in 2017, although there were “small signs of improvement” in 2023, according to the report.Rippon Ubhi, who runs Sanofi’s UK and Ireland business and the French company’s speciality care division, said: “The findings in this report paint a concerning picture for UK patients and our economy.“The UK is increasingly being viewed as ‘uninvestable’ in global boardrooms due to unprecedented [NHS]clawback ratesand restrictive patient access to medicines. While other countries are actively investing in innovative medicines for patients, the UK is falling behind.”The UK head of the Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis, Johan Kahlström, has also said high costs meansthe UK is “largely uninvestable,”, while the health secretary, Wes Streeting, has pledged that he will not allow firms to “rip off” taxpayers.The government has set a target to position the UK as the leading life sciences economy in Europe by 2030 and third globally by 2035, while the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said the UK is at theforefrontof developments in the sector.Torbett said: “The UK has a world-class science base and the potential to lead globally in developing the next generation of medicines and vaccines. But without a more competitive environment for investment, we risk losing out to other countries making bold moves to attract internationally mobile investment.”Only 37% of new medicines are made fully available for their licensed indications in the UK, compared with 90% in Germany.

And yet what they are seeing with theWorld Cuphere in the United States, Mexico and Canada is the prospect of increasing their revenues up close to 400% compared to what they were in Qatar.”Mamdani dipped into World Cup history, saying that the last time the men’s World Cup was held in the United States, in 1994, tickets could be had for less than $200. Indeed, Fifa in 1993 set a low-end ticket price of $25 (worth about $56 in 2025), with the most expensive ticket to the final going for $475 (worth about $1,000 in 2025). Fifa announced that ticket prices for group games in 2026 would start at $60 and hit $6,730 for the best seat at the final, but crucially those are the figures before dynamic pricing takes effect. Bothare expected to rise considerablyover the course of the multi-phase sales process, which began on Wednesday.World Cup’s dynamic pricing model lays bare Fifa’s singular motive: profit, at all costsRead more“There’s just no chance for so many who love this game so much to actually be able to go and see this,” Mamdani said. “This also has a real impact on the potential for the atmosphere of the World Cup and just how many fans will actually be there. Because so often the people who get the tickets quickest are not the ones who are actually the most eager to be there. They’re the ones who are the most excited at the prospect of a profit.”Mamdani’s petition calls forFifato end dynamic pricing for World Cup tickets, set aside 15% of tickets for local residents, and place a cap on the amount tickets are allowed to be resold for on Fifa’s ticketing platform (Fifa will do this for games in Mexico due to local laws, but will not implement caps on its exchange for other World Cup games).“I think that if you don’t ask, you cannot win,” Mamdani said. “I think there’s still so many people who have not even heard of [this] affront to the game. And I’m hopeful just in the last few hours since we’ve launched this, thousands of people have added their names and we’re going to keep making the case.”Mamdani shockedUS politicswhen he won the Democratic nomination for New York City mayor, beating more prominent names, such as former New York governor Andrew Cuomo. However, his win has not been met with universal acclaim – including from his own party. Several prominent Democrats, including House minority leader and fellow New Yorker Hakeem Jeffries, have declined to endorse Mamdani as Cuomo has re-entered the race as an independent, alongside incumbent Eric Adams.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And it’s a campaign that started at 1%. Maybe if I had to characterize it in terms of a recent upset, maybe this is theLeicester City of campaigns. And so I think there are still many that we are introducing ourselves to, but I’m excited to earn their support.”Mamdani is a longtime soccer fan who has supported Arsenal since his childhood in Uganda, saying he had magnets of the team’sInvincibles side of 2003-04on his fridge. He offered the “contested point” that the Gunners are the most popular team in Uganda.“[Former manager] Arsène Wenger was one of the first coaches to bring in a number of African players into the team,” Mamdani said. “And some of my early memories are memories of Kanu, of Lauren, of Kolo Touré, of Emmanuel Eboué, Alex Song … it has been a real part of just my life and my identity and also my willingness to internally believe in that this is the year and this is the season. It’s a good preparation for being a democratic socialist.”Mamdani acknowledged the possibility that, as New York City mayor, he could attend the 2026 World Cup final, where he would be sat near Donald Trump. Mamdani said he expects the US president would be booed,as he was at this year’s US Open men’s final.“There’s no amount of censorship that can quiet the actual response of people when they see this president in person, because we’re talking about someone who is already attacking the very fabric of life in this city,” he said. “It’ll be a place where I will make the case once and again for the working-class New Yorkers that they’re leaving behind.”You can listen to the full interview onThursday’s episode of Football Weekly.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026FifaFootball politicsNew YorkZohran MamdaniWorld CupUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s not to say all is lost. While Mauricio Pochettino’s optimism rankled aftera 2-0 loss to a South Koreaside that had a disconcertingly easy time of it, there was much more to feel good about inthe 2-0 win over Japan. Still, it was one game. Japan rested a lot of regulars. (Then again, the US were hardly at full strength.)LSTypically I preach reason and patience, but the frustration after the loss to Korea felt legitimate. This version of the USMNT had many opportunities to prove to fans they could be a team that will win multiple knockout games at aWorld Cupthey will co-host. They have taken advantage of almost none of those opportunities. Will it matter if they still win those knockout games? No. It will be party time. But concern is warranted in the interim.JANew-look USMNT show comfort and confidence in 2-0 win over JapanRead moreI mean, it’s the host country with talented players and one of the most high-profile coaches in the world at the helm and they have looked mostly bad against quality opposition in the last year. I understand that results don’t really matter until June, but performances still matter. But I don’t think people are unreasonable for wanting more to be excited about.AAIt is. Usually teams hope to close out the year prior to a World Cup solidifying a roster and maybe tinkering at the edges; adding a bright newcomer here and there, or bringing a veteran returning from injury back into the fold. But the USMNT have been making pretty large changes from match to match. Perhaps some of this can be ascribed to Pochettino’s limited window with the US men’s national team, but the overall chemistry and disjointed backline play should alarm fans if it can’t get ironed out.JFWho improved his USMNT case the most over this window?Can I say Pochettino? No. OK, fine.Folarin Balogun. When he came on against Korea, his impact was obvious and the US suddenly had a striker actually capable of creating chances for himself. While Ricardo Pepi is a clinical finisher, Balogun is the only one who consistently makes plays with the ball at his feet, carves out pockets of space, or opens corridors to run into. He could have had a handful of goals this window – his triple-miss against Korea was particularly unfortunate – but he finally bagged his first USMNT goal in more than a year against Japan. Balogun is the incumbent striker.LSAlejandro Zendejas. The debate about whether MLS players belong in the national team or not has obscured that Liga MX, a league whose top teams continually lift the Concacaf Champions Cup at the expense of their MLS rivals, has often been ignored. Zendejas got a few quick looks from Pochettino, but probably not as many as were warranted for perhaps the best player on Club América, one of the best teams in the region. He got his biggest opportunity in this window and was a bright spot against Korea, then scored a goal against Japan. Pochettino himself noted that he’s “in the race.”JAMatt Freese. Matt Turner’s lack of game time and so-so form has created a wide-open competition for the USMNT’s No 1 shirt, which Freese has seemingly stepped right into after two solid-enough games this window and an entire Gold Cup tournament as a starter. Freese has been one of MLS’s best shot-stoppers for a couple years, and he combines that with a better ability to play with his feet in comparison to Turner. There are still questions about organization, with both South Korea goals coming from basic defensive breakdowns, but it seems like the starting job is his to lose, for now.AACan you say that it wasChristian Pulisic, who has been the star of the national team since at least 2018? There’s never been a doubt that he would make the World Cup roster, but after taking acontroversial breakfrom the national team and missing the 2025 Gold Cup, there were a lot of questions surrounding the Milan man. He fielded his share of criticism from Landon Donovan over the summer (who took his own break from the national team), but he proved just how critical he is to the team again. He was central in the USMNT’s buildup in both matches, and providing a key assist against Japan.JFView image in fullscreenJosh Sargent extended a lengthy scoreless streak for the US in his start against South Korea.Photograph: Jess Stiles/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockWho hurt his USMNT case the most over this window?USMNT’s listless defeat to South Korea causes alarm bells again as World Cup loomsRead moreAny striker who isn’t Balogun, butJosh Sargentin particular. Who can even say why national team Sargent is a trembling husk of club Sargent? All we know is that it’s been almost six years since his last US goal, and there is no longer time to try to fix him, especially with several more viable strikers in the pool.LSSebastian Berhalter. After standout showings in the Concacaf Champions Cup with the Vancouver Whitecaps and during the Gold Cup as he got a look from Pochettino and staff, this window felt like a test for Berhalter to see if he could hang with more daunting opposition. It was not a test that he passed, struggling with Son Heung-min in the Korea match and not being able to show the type of connective play that made him an asset during the summer. While his set-piece prowess is so unique in the pool it feels like he could still compete for a spot, the fact that he didn’t get in against Japan is inauspicious.JAYeah I’ll have to agree with Jon.Sargenthas been in perhaps the best form of his club career with Norwich this season, with six goals in five games. If ever there was to be a window for that to translate to the international level, this would be the one. It didn’t happen. If this wasn’t his final chance, it’s got to be close.AATim Reamlooked out of place at times, keeping Son onside for South Korea’s first goal. He’ll be 38 for the World Cup, and is the most experienced presence on the team so his place on the roster isn’t likely (and shouldn’t be) in doubt. Still it remains slightly worrying that he’ll be counted on if the US are going to make any sort of impact at the World Cup. Ream’s distribution is vital in transition, and he’ll need to be stronger in the games to come.JFskip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I guess that’s two issues, but I’m going to stick with them both, because I think one informs the other. The US struggled in these areas against South Korea but did much better at both on Tuesday against Japan. Still, the endless turnover in the lineup has made it hard to form anything like pressing cohesion in most games, which has tended to lead to difficulty in transition and a dearth of scoring chances downstream from that.LSSteely and strangely divisive, Michael Bradley’s playing career cut to the id of US soccer fandomRead moreDefendingimmediately after losing the ball.It seems strange since the US midfield looked like a strength, with the supposedly locked-in MMA midfield of Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah and Tyler Adams. Only one of those guys was even called in for this window, and while Adams is doing well, there needs to be a partner with him in the midfield who can cover for him when he gets forward – and keeps the center-backs from having to run too much as well. Cristian Roldan’s addition to the roster feels like a panic move aimed at reversing the regression there, but sometimes panic moves work, right?JAChemistry and reps –another separate-but-related nomination. I’d argue that the United States’ supposed biggest strength heading into 2026 wasn’t just that they had more talented players than ever before, but that those players would have been playing alongside each other internationally for going on seven years or so. That’s an advantage few countries can match, but Pochettino has forfeited so much of that in favor of bringing in untested players to increase competition. There’s a solid enough argument in favor of doing that, I just feel the time to stop experimenting was before the Gold Cup.AALineup consistency. Every national team has to struggle with travel and nagging player injuries that make fielding the same 11 starters nearly impossible. Pochettino joining to helm the team halfway through the World Cup cycle makes this even more difficult, as he has had to play catch up in gaining familiarity with the players.JFWhere will the US finish in next year’s World Cup?I think they survive the group stage – which two-thirds of teams will, in a diluted pool of opponents – in large part because of the energy and excitement that will spark once America wakes up and realizes there’s a World Cup on its doorstep. And then I think they ride that momentum toa first knockout stage win since 2002. Maybe even another, with a little luck in the bracket.LSGetting out of the group should be the minimum, and the right draw means the chance to win in the knockout round. So, put me down for around of 16 eliminationthat, if anything, only serves to rile up more debate around the team as fans and experts weigh in on whether or not that counts as success in this era.JAI don’t see this team getting eliminated in the group stage given that they’re already seeded and the expanded tournament means at least one and potentially all three opponents there will be eminently beatable. But I haven’t seen enough to convince me of their bonafides in a high-pressure knockout situation. Today, I think they put in a good showing butexit in the round of 32.AAIf the results leading up to the tournament continue as they have in 2025, I’m not convinced we’ll see any better than the typicalfirst knockout-round exitthat US fans have become accustomed to.JFExplore more on these topicsUSAUS sportsWorld Cup 2026World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The use of airport-style scanners led to huge queues outside the arena.The Ryder Cup will have a bigger attendance – about 50,000 per day – and has no scope to change starting times. Most of the gallery typically want to be in place first thing in the morning for the initial tee shots.Sources says the Ryder Cup organisers are trying to be proactive so that Friday morning play and crowds are unaffected. Spectators have paid $750 for tickets as the US team attempt to reclaim the Ryder Cup from Europe.A spokesperson for the PGA of America said: “While President Trump has indicated interest in attending the 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage, specific details have not been confirmed. As we get closer to Ryder Cup week, we will communicate any relevant updates that may impact the Ryder Cup experience. Our priority remains delivering a seamless, secure and first-class event for all our guests.”Luke Donald, the European captain, has admitted his team will need to be ready for the fuss created by Trump’s appearance. Donald said: “There was some delays at the tennis. I think you’re probably all aware of that but hopefully they have learnt from that.“It’s a big process, obviously, to get a president to come to an event. There’s a lot of security and everything. It takes some work, I’m sure. The PGA of America’s job is to make sure it’s seamless. He wants to be there to probably greet the players and I think the crowd is probably going to be loud no matter what.“We know that the president is going to be there, it’s not like he’s just going to turn up and we didn’t expect it, so it’s fine.”Trump’s association with golf was emphasised again on Wednesdayyesterday with confirmation that his Doonbeg resort will stage the Irish Open in 2026.Explore more on these topicsRyder CupGolfDonald TrumpUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Welcome to the Enhanced Games – the sporting event no one wants | Marina HydeRead more“Realistically, I’ve achieved ­everything I can and now the Enhanced is giving me a new opportunity. I definitely don’t think that’s undermining a clean sport. I really respect the sport I’ve been part of and I would never step back in knowing I’ve done something which isn’t in the rules.”Proud said he had found ­competitors committing doping ­violations in his sport “incredibly frustrating”. The Enhanced Games permits athletes to take substances approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, under strict supervision.“I will never take anything that I am unsure of,” Proud said. “They are not allowing anyone to participate if they are under any stress or health risks.”AUK Sportspokesperson said: “UK Sport condemns everything the Enhanced Games stands for in the strongest possible terms. We believe it risks compromising athlete health and welfare, undermines the trust of fans and is the absolute antithesis to our philosophy of winning well.“We are incredibly disappointed to learn that any British athlete in one of our Olympic or Paralympic programmes would support such an event. We are engaging with our colleagues at Aquatics GB as a matter of urgency to determine Ben Proud’s suitability to receive public funds.“It is clear, however, that any breach of anti-doping rules is contrary to the policies any athlete must comply with to receive UK Sport funding.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The France and Real Madrid forward also said he would never encourage a child of his to follow in his footsteps.In a long and occasionally bitter interview, Mbappé told L’Équipe: “I’m fatalist about the world of football, but not about life. Life is won­derful. Football is what it is.World Cup qualifying: Armenia stun Republic of Ireland while Norway hit 11Read more“I like to say that people who go to the stadium are lucky toonlycome and see a show and not know what’s going on behind the scenes. ­Honestly, if I didn’t have this passion, the ­football world would have disgusted me a long time ago.“That’s the world we live in, and we can’t change it. I will never advise a child of mine to step into the ­football world.”The interview to mark a revamp of L’Équipe magazine appeared hours after Mbappé scored his 52nd goal in 92 appearances forFrance, in a 2-1 win against Iceland, and beating Thierry Henry’s scoring record.Mbappé left Paris Saint‑Germainlast year after a conflict that is still not resolved and is the subject of legal action. Mbappé has withdrawn his complaint of harassment against the club, but is claiming €55m in alleged unpaid salary and a bonus. PSG claim Mbappé agreed to waive the €55m when he moved to Real Madrid and have made a counter‑claim of €98m.“The more money you have, the more problems you have,” the 26-year-old forward told L’Équipe.“Some people don’t see that your life has changed; they want to hold on to the image of you as a child, when you were with them. But you’re not the same person any more. You have responsibilities, commitments, a job, people to answer to …”Of his dispute with PSG, he said he had no wish to harm the club where he made his name. “It’s my right, it’s employment law. I signed an employment contract. I just wanted to be paid. I have nothing against PSG, I love the club, I have friends there, but this is the only way to get what I’m owed, something I’ve earned through the sweat of my brow.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some people spend their entire careers waiting for recognition or for people to really know who they are. You have to learn to live with that.“You waste a lot of energy if you spend your time fighting it, and you’ll never win. When you look at the great French athletes, they’ve all been torn apart by public opinion at some point.

It’s the latest in a string of glitzy moments for the league, which recently has seen the rise of Indiana’s Caitlin Clarkand her rivalry withChicago’s Angel Reese, along with skyrocketing revenue and the news ofexpansion into new markets. But as a bright future unfolds, we wanted to dive into the past to remember seven hoopers who helped make this all possible.Nancy LiebermanIf you learn only one thing about Nancy Lieberman, let it be this: her nickname on the court was “Lady Magic.” A sublime point guard, her passing was on par with the likes of the five-time champion Los Angeles Lakers floor general. A member of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, Lieberman remains asteward of the gametoday. But while she was only able to play in the WNBA for a total of 26 games – 25 during the league’s inaugural season in 1997 and one remarkable tilt at 49 years old in 2008 – she remains one of the sport’s most important names. During her career, she even played in the USBL (a top men’s league). Since then, she’s coached both in the W and the NBA. Today, she’s a broadcaster for the OKC Thunder.See more.Cheryl MillerIt’s not every day that a hall of famerweeps on a podcasttalking about his sister. But not every hall of famer has a sibling like Cheryl Miller. Growing up with Cheryl taught her brother, Reggie, how to be competitive and win (albeit rarely on the family hoop growing up). Today, Cheryl remains probably the best women’s basketball player of all time. Sadly, though, her career ended without her playing in the WNBA – the league just wasn’t around during her prime. But that didn’t stop her from coaching the Phoenix Mercury in the W and earning a 70-52 record. Phoenix even made it to the WNBA finals in 1998. But as a player? Cheryl is a hall of famer, like her brother, and scored an incredible 105 points in a single high school game.See more.Sheryl SwoopesA hall of famer and former three-time MVP in the WNBA, Swoopes was also a two-time scoring champ and three-time defensive player of the year. Oh and she won a whopping four titles in the W. That’s a stunning legacy. But since she retired from the game, Swoopes has largely been out of the public eye. (Today, her son Jordan Jackson is a pro hooper with the Maine Celtics.) Swoopes, who was the first signee the WNBA ever had, also boasted her own groundbreaking signature Nike sneaker in the early 2000s, the Air Swoopes.See more.Lauren JacksonThe Seattle Storm are one of the most valuable franchises in the WNBA,valued at around $150m. The team is known for players like Sue Bird, Breanna Stewart and Jewell Loyd. But there is another key figure in the franchise’s history: the sweet-shooting Lauren Jackson. The Australian frontcourt player is a hall of famer, a three-time MVP and two-time WNBA champ, among many other accolades. Where would the Storm be without their first great star? Jackson, who was the top pick in the league’s 2001 draft, played a dozen years in the W and helped to put Seattle on the basketball map.See more.Lusia HarrisA center from Delta State University, where she was the only Black player on the roster, Harris was drafted by the New Orleans Jazz in the seventh round with the 137th pick in the 1977 NBA draft (she later revealed she declined to attend training camp as she was pregnant). She remains the only woman everto be drafted by an NBA team (Denise Long was taken years earlier in 1969 by the San Francisco Warriors, but the NBA later voided that pick). Harris, who played in one of the first-ever women’s basketball games at Madison Square Garden, scoring 47 points as a senior in 1976-77, is also the first Black woman ever inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. And while she never played in the NBA or WNBA, she did suit up for one season with the Houston Angels of the Women’s Professional Basketball League in 1979-80.See more.Ann MeyersAnn Meyers boasts a lot offirsts. The first woman to sign a four-year college athletic scholarship, She was also the first woman to sign a contract with the NBA, doing so in 1979 with the Indiana Pacers for $50,000. She participated in tryouts for the team but did not make the final roster. One of the first women inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, Meyers was also a member of the Houston Angels, drafted to the WBL in 1978 with the top pick. Eight years later, she married LA Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale and the two became the first married couple to be hall of famers in their chosen sports. As a player, though, Meyers was unmatched. Today, her No 15 jersey hangs from the UCLA rafters, one of the first four numbers ever to be retired by the school, along with Denise Curry, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton.See more.Lynette WoodardWhile Lynette Woodard did play two seasons in the W, they came toward the very end of her career when she was in her late 30s. Prior to that, she was a standout at the University of Kansas. Later, she was the first female member of the Harlem Globetrotters, making her also the first woman to play for a men’s pro team. During her college years, though, Kansas was not part of the NCAA, instead the school was part of the AIAW, or the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. So, when people talk about Clark being the all-time NCAA scorer for men’s or women’s basketball, the news often neglects to cite Woodard’s contributions. Clark scored 3,951 points but Woodard is second in women’s hoops history with 3,649.See more.Explore more on these topicsWNBABasketballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He hardly needs reminding that plenty of people have had their say since he swapped the Premier Leaguefor the Saudi Pro Leaguejust over a year ago.An Asian Champions League winner’s medaland 35 goals for Al-Ahli later, the striker is defiant, even if he found himself on the outside as England played their latest World Cup qualifiers.“Those that know me, know that I do what I want to do,” Toney says. “If there is something I want to go for, to try, then I will do it. If people want to talk, they can talk. It doesn’t hurt me, doesn’t bother me, I just concentrate on myself. I do what makes me happy.”World Cup’s dynamic pricing model lays bare Fifa’s singular motive: profit, at all costsRead moreToney is in Jeddah, where the temperature is forecast to be above 40C this weekend. He says he enjoys the beaches and restaurants of a city he describes as “more chill” than Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh. He did, though, need time to settle by the Red Sea after his move from Brentford.“The weather played a massive part,” he says. “Somebody should go and try to play in a sauna and see if they can cope. You have to play a different game with different tactics and it is something you adapt to. There are different blocks of 20 minutes where it is intense and then it has to slow down and pick up again.”Starting life at Al-Ahli alongside Roberto Firmino, who left this summer, andRiyad Mahrezhelped, and Toney finished last season with 23 league goals, two fewer than Cristiano Ronaldo and two more than Karim Benzema and the Morocco international Abderrazak Hamdallah, who shared third place in the scoring charts.“Once I got going, the goals came,” he says. “I felt like I could have scored a lot more, but even so I finished as the second-top scorer in the league in my first season somewhere that is completely new to me. I feel like it is an achievement. This season, I am hoping to take first spot and hopefully that will help the team and win games and get where we need to be.”View image in fullscreenIvan Toney scored 23 league goals in 30 games for Al-Ahli last season.Photograph: ReutersFor Al-Ahli, that is a first title since 2016. Fifth last time, they started this campaign with a 1-0 win overNeom,Toney running on to a through-ball from Enzo Millot to slot home beautifully. A hat-trick followed three days later against Al-Arabi in the King’s Cup.“We have more than enough quality to be winning games and if we continue to play well then we have a good chance. We showed that in the [Asian] Champions League.”If fifth was a little disappointing forAl-Ahli, winning the Asian Champions League in May more than made up for it, the team beating Kawasaki Frontale in the final in front of more than 60,000 fans in Jeddah. “In the semi-finals, especially, the atmosphere against Al-Hilal was top,” Toney says. “It shows how passionate the fans are here.”Outside Jeddah and Riyadh, though, crowds tend to be low. That is cited to reject claims that Saudi Arabia has a world-class league. “It’s different, but you are there for one thing: to get three points and take them home,” Toney says. “The fire is within yourself and the changing room. It doesn’t matter if there are 10 people watching, 10,000 or 20,000. It’s on the players to go and win.”Toney echoes Ronaldo in arguing that the league is up there with the best. “Ronaldo has been around the world and probably knows a lot more than me as I have only played in the Premier League, the Championship and Leagues One and Two. For me, [the Pro League] is on a par with the Premier League. If [Al-Ahli] were in the Premier League, we’d give it a good go and we’d be close to the top four. It is a quality league and people should not turn their noses up.

The players are not as known as in the Premier League, but there are many who can play there.”Not that Toney’s move appears to have helped his England prospects. He won five of his first six caps from March to June 2024, including at the Euros, but has added one since his transfer.

I am sure he has other things to be concentrating on. My job is to do well. It is what it is. If you are good enough, you are good enough; it doesn’t matter where you are playing in the world. As long as you are doing the right things and scoring goals, then you give yourself a chance.”The 29-year-old says he does not miss the Premier League, but keeps an eye on Brentford. Although they have lost Thomas Frank – “one of the best coaches I have worked with” – Toney thinks they will be fine. “They’ve always had that hard-work mentality. They have never had big names and every player who comes in works hard for each other. I believe they’ll be good this season.”If not, perhaps there will be opportunities for some players in Saudi Arabia. “People are intrigued,” Toney says. “Some players have been offered a chance to play over here and want to know what it is about.

Tuchel, who named a slimmed-down 24‑man squad for the fixtures, had Morgan Gibbs-White on the bench. Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer and Phil Foden, the bigger-name options for the role, missed out because of fitness issues.“I am always brave – you know that,” Tuchel said, when asked about the possibility of having to drop an A‑lister. “We took some brave decisions already. We nominated a squad of only 21 [outfield players] to keep the competition going.“The competition for places is on – if you are in camp, you are in your best behaviour, your best shape, best form and you make the best of it.

Everybody can remember the panic that gripped, for example, when David Beckham and Wayne Rooney became injury doubts on the eve of tournaments.“If a big player misses out on a tournament, we need to have solutions; if he misses a camp, we need to have solutions,” Tuchel said. “We have to focus on the guys who are available and who are ready to be the best versions of themselves and the best teammate possible.“This is a team sport and it was teamwork in its purest form against Serbia.

In: insults about the prime minister, the main hook of which is still the endlessly repeatable Keir Starm-muurs aaa waannnker to the tune of the riff from Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes.When Jack White first wrote that hook he was famously disturbed and excited by it, aware that this thing was a monster, that it just needed shape and words. This probably wasn’t exactly what he had in mind. But the muse goes where it must, and the first few rounds could be heard shortly before kick-offon Tuesday night. It was there from Monday lunchtime in the old town pavement cafes, the new English summer songbook, the Don’t Take Me Home, the Three Wankers of its time.That core message also cuts across musical genres.

In Belgrade a new take – “We’ve got Palmer/Fuck Keir Starmer” – could be heard drifting around the cobbled streets in the wee hours of matchday morning.At this point you could perhaps put a favourable slant on all this by saying what we’re talking about here is just a few bored men bantering in a bar, or by demonising all of those involved as flag fondlers, far‑right nutjobs, essentially primates, cutouts, non‑people. But this doesn’t really work, for two reasons.First, because the people singing about Starmer are not the kind of extremists reported in these pages marauding across Kentish villages waving the flag like a club. These are solvent steady grown-ups, people who vote and are organised enough to travel, who were praised by the Belgrade police on Wednesday for their exemplary behaviour, and who, for what it’s worth, berated the home crowd for being racist, incorrectly in the event, when the game was stopped because somebody was shining a laser pointer at Noni Madueke. And second, because this hasn’t happened before. Starmer is the first prime minister to actively lose football. The national anthem, the Queen, the King, have been booed. But politicians have been pretty much invisible in football, even when Margaret Thatcher was actively demonising supporters, even through the public farce of Johnson and Truss. Tony Blair tried to piggyback football as a pop culture thing, but remained a gurning jackanapes on the fringes.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer is the first British prime minister to actively lose football.Photograph: Simon Dawson/No 10 Downing StreetStarmer is the first to actively become The Enemy. How has he managed this? Perhaps because he actively tried to leverage football at the start of his premiership, which began a couple of days afterJude Bellingham’s miraculous overhead kickat the European Championship, arguably the first feel‑bad miraculous overhead kick in football history, a miraculous overhead kick that led precisely nowhere.Starmer surfed the wave grimly, holding up a shirt with the Dutch PM, danglingthe prospect of a bank holidayif England won the final, the most obvious cast‑iron guarantee that England would not win the final. A few days after that the events in Southport happened. Unrest, alienation, the two-tier Keir stuff.Chuck in the private box stylings at Arsenal and Starmer’s relationship with football has been a perfect miniature of his failings as a political communicator, as a personal branding unit, vulnerable ‘always to more naturally charismatic personalities. The footballising of public discourse, the rise of banter‑culture as a serious political force, was already coming for him, putting him in a mode where he is uncomfortable, the geography teacher trying to breakdance. Hampered by wheeling around in a tiny little ideological space, he is often unable to say anything that doesn’t sound like a low-spec replicant pretending to understand human feelings.But there is also more to this than the scarecrowing of an eager man in glasses. And more than simply some political comms failure metric. First we lost Avocado Woman. Laptop Bag Guy. Internet Shout Person. And now Football Cafe Man.Football is always telling you things, pulling out a seat and inviting you to test the wind. The Starmer song is so very now. It’s alienation, loss of trust, democratic deficit. It speaks, and here wind chimes tinkle and the screen begins to dissolve, to the age of flags. The nation is currently a place of flags: flags as lament, celebration, threat, territory marker; flags as something Labour ministers must now pretend to possess in vast numbers during radio interviews, flags as bridge decor and mini-roundabout daubing. Flags as anything but the most English thing of all, something to be ignored and even avoided, a deep distrust of the powerful semiotics of a flag, a wariness of all lion and unicorn stuff, the knowledge that a flag is never just a flag.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And it is here that football is useful, as an explainer and a natural home for this stuff. Flags have always been present in England football. Welcome to our world, the rest of the country. Except here the relationship with the flag is cautiously formalised, a more comfortable place for his kind of attachment to find a shape England fans are often dismissed en masse as chair throwers and circle-the-tables beer consumption machines, in part because they have often circled the tables, drunk beer and thrown chairs. But we remember also Gareth Southgate’s idea of Englishness, the most coherent version of patriotism any public figure has voiced in recent years, orRoy Hodgson talking fluent, courteous Croydon-accented Frenchin the Wembley press room after the Paris terror attacks of 2015.It’s there in the fond chintzy portable pageantry of the away trip, a shipping forecast map of the nation from Hull to Portsmouth to Bristol. The best football version of flag culture is not a craven, dog-like me and my country thing, not Tommy Robinson fans weaponising the experience for the benefit of an online post. It includes a natural distrust of authority, fondness for home, the memory of resistance and indifference to the National Front trying to infiltrate terrace culture in the 1980s. Starmer, unable to find any kind of path in football, could do a lot worse than to study England football’s management of this.And in many ways it felt fitting that Belgrade’s Marakana should be the stage for a glimpse of the full-blown Keir dialectic, in part because this is the kind of stadium people like to fetishise as a rage-space, a journey into the deep dark heart of footballing nationalism, even if England turned up led by a gaunt German technocrat who even seems a bit bored and drifty when he’s talking tactics these days.Marc Guéhi turns frustration into triumph to boost England claims | Jacob SteinbergRead moreBut in the end there was a sadness about Serbia here, not just in the poverty of Dragan Stojkovic’s team, but in the basic unhappiness around it. Stojkovic’s name was booed inside the stadium before kick-off, a reaction to his recent statements in support of the government. Later, a group of black-shirted men, described variously as local henchmen, would intervene as the crowd were singing their own anti-government songs, an extension of the suppression of protest against Aleksandar Vucic’s authoritarian government.Serbia is in a very strange in-out space right now, ranged across the lines of power, still formally semi-pretending it wants to join the EU, while also aligning itself with Vladimir Putin. Its people seem enraged and disgusted by the spectre of government corruption, exasperated with cronyism, grey power, time-servers, the weaponing of popular fears by the media.It could be tempting here to say, well, it sounds a lot like the UK. But only a bit, so far. And Serbia itself is a warning from the darkest extreme of this process, a nation where the horrendous ethnic bloodshed of a quarter of a century ago is still right there in the eyeline. Beware all flag stuff, the demonising of outsiders, the thinnest end of nationalist obsession. Still being able to call Keir Starmer names at the football without the attentions of the men with batons is at the very least a kind of freedom. Plus the Christmas No 1 is probably sorted. Fire up Midge Ure. Keir Starmer’s a Wanker is here to stay for now. And football is, once again, telling us things.Explore more on these topicsEnglandKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

When you look at what the club has achieved in recent times, it’s an outstanding feat to be where we are right now.“Other clubs that have won promotion have struggled to stay in the league, but in a short space of time we’re back in Europe and competing for honours, which is a great credit to everyone involved.“I get a sense that the club wants more and that’s certainly what I want, so I think it’s a really exciting time.

According to Nottinghamshire police, the charge is of the most serious Category A offence and relates to a video recovered by officers in February.The charge of making an indecent image of a child refers to activities such as downloading, sharing or saving abuse photos or videos. Images that are classified Category A customarily show children involved in “penetrative sexual activity”, according to Sentencing Council guidelines.Coote was charged on 12 August and is on conditional bail. He is due to appear at Nottingham magistrates court on Thursday.The 43-year-old was sacked by the English refereeing body Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO) last December, after a string of revelations emerged related to his off-field behaviour.One video shared online showed Coote makingabusive comments about the then Liverpool manager Jürgen Kloppin 2020.

His violins – unique pieces, each identified by a name – are today in the hands of some of the greatest musicians in the world and can fetch a price of more than £10m.So it was no coincidence that the Violin Museum, in Piazza Guglielmo Marconi, was chosen to unveil who the city’s football team, Cremonese, hope will become their greatest soloist:Jamie Vardy.Ten of the best-value deals from this summer’s transfer windowRead moreThe excitement that the former Leicester forward has created in these parts is almost impossible to describe. Before Vardy entered the stage two local journalists were saying they could not believe that such a player, a world-renowned name,had joined the clubto put this small provincial city on the European football map.The 38-year-old joiningCremonese– who are newly promoted to Serie A but have started the season with two successive wins including victory at Milan – was a shock toGrigiorossifans and for Italian football as a whole.“If a month ago someone had told me that today I would be here presenting Vardy, I would have called him crazy,” the team’s sporting director, Simone Giacchetta, said. “But in football sometimes certain distances can be bridged.”And then, there he was, the working-class hero of English football, the striker who led Claudio Ranieri’s Leicester to the Premier League title in 2015‑16, sitting in the middle of the wonderful auditorium named after the honorary president of Cremonese, Cavaliere Giovanni Arvedi.Looking relaxed in a white polo shirt with the grey and red stripes of his new club, a pair of blue trousers and light shoes, Vardy is sitting in a leather armchair at the centre of the wooden theatre, casually answering questions, completely at ease.There are a lot of smiles, for example when he and Giacchetta discuss the hashtag that has gone viral in recent days: “StradiVardy”, a version of a nickname that had already been used for another famous striker who, at the start of his career wore the Cremonese shirt: the late Gianluca Vialli.View image in fullscreenJamie Vardy’s arrival has caused a stir in Cremona. ‘They told me it was a quiet place but it was quite the opposite in the first days,’ he says.Photograph: Riccardo Bortolotti/APOr when he is told that someone compared the impact of his arrival in Cremona to that of Cristiano Ronaldo at Juventus. “The first time coming to the city with the fans was fantastic,” he says. “They had told me it was a quiet place but it was quite the opposite in the first days. It was a lot of fun and I discovered a bit of the city, going up the Torrazzo [the city’s famous tower]. I will learn Italian, but [for now] it is not a problem: football has its own language, with the ball.”Vardy’s impact has been incredible. After his arrival season ticket sales were reopened and ended with a figure of 8,208 – which may not sound much but the city has only a little more than 70,000 inhabitants. It was a record. This season’s Cremonese shirt is sold out: they can only be ordered on the club’s website but without a delivery date. In a few days more shirts were sold than in the entirety of last season.There is a buzz around the place and Vardy is asked whether Cremonese,who sit joint topafter two matches, can repeat Leicester’s miracle. “I spoke to Arvedi and [the coach] Davide Nicola and I understood that the primary objective at the start of the season is survival, just like it was at Leicester,” he says. “Clearly, match after match we give 100%. In football anyone can beat anyone, that is what we train for.“During my whole career I have been underestimated and I worked to prove everyone wrong, and I have succeeded in doing that. I get that at the start of the season almost no one believed that Cremonese would survive. The coach, however, with his work ethic, wants to avoid relegation at all costs. It has been a great start but we know it will be a long season. The fight to beat the odds is what convinced me to join.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He gave me a book in English about Cremona, which was a really nice gesture. He wants to see the club saved and making progress. My family is excited for this new adventure.”Vardy, warming up now, also has something to say about the sceptics who see this more as a marketing ploy than anything else. “If you ask me that question, then you are one of the sceptics,” he says, smiling at the journalist who had asked about it. “It is up to me to disprove the predictions.

Eight years ago Itoje and Owen Farrell were forced to sit out one of England’s autumn fixtures after the 2017 Lions tour because of their “exceptional workloads” with Eddie Jones revealing the pair, who missed out on their £25,000 match fees, were furious.The club-country agreement signed last year guarantees Test players an international salary of £160,000, however, and Prem clubs believe the cost of meeting welfare demands could be shared between them and England, who also face Fiji, New Zealand and Argentina this autumn.Clubs can apply for Lions players to be given special dispensation to be available for the start of the season this month.Farrell has been cleared to make his second Saracens debut against Newcastle Red Bulls with his late call‑up to the Lions tour coming after a lengthy injury-enforced break, but in general directors of rugby are abiding by the agreement and want England to share the load.View image in fullscreenOwen Farrell is expected to feature for Saracens from the start of the season after rejoining the club.Photograph: Steve Haag Sports/ShutterstockAsked if Freeman, Henry Pollock, Fin Smith and Alex Mitchell could be rested, the Northampton director of rugby, Phil Dowson, said: “I’ve mooted that. Steve as you know is non-committal when it comes to that stuff. Nearer the time he might be. He’s not going to make any promises now, and I don’t expect him to.“I’ve said my piece, and what I think needs to happen, and everyone at the RFU, [the performance director] Phil Morrow and everyone understands that.”The Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, has given Itoje, Jamie George and Earl an extra week off but Farrell is primed to begin the season with his boyhood club.“Owen is different and he’ll be available for week one,” said McCall, who revealed Elliot Daly is on course to be backfrom his broken armin October. “We haven’t actually spoken about which week [the others] will come back.” Asked if they could be rested by Borthwick, McCall said: “It depends what the Tests are. If there is an ‘easier’ one then those are things that we could have some common sense around, so that it’s fair-ish. But I think if you ask a player then he’ll want to play in international games and we’ll always support that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re going to look after Finn incredibly well, as we have done over the last two years. Our relationship is extremely good.”Curry, meanwhile, has insisted he is “very happy” at Sale despite continued speculation over theR360 breakaway leaguestarting next September.“It sounds like there’s a lot of external noise,” he said. “I’ve not heard anything. It’s everywhere but within the players, if that makes sense. So I don’t know. I’m very happy at Sale. I just think at the club we’re doing a great job. We’re in a very fortunate position where we are in Manchester.

Those established teams are usually boys teams, so the girls are playing at nine o’clock at night when the facilities have become free.“We think that’s unacceptable, so we’re looking at using the power we’ve got in government to attach conditions to the funding to make sure that doesn’t take place and there is equal access.”Calls for the greater inclusion of girls’ and women’s sport have grown over recent years, in part after the inspirational success ofthe Lionessesand the2021 US Open champion, Emma Raducanu.This year, the government announced it would spend up to £400m on improving grassroots facilities, with an emphasis on making those spaces more inclusive. The Guardian understands that the conditions related to this funding would be extended to include all other sports if the government’s plans are carried out.Last month, the government announcedfunding for two cricket domes, which would allow for year-round play, with one of the venues at Farington, near Preston, intended as a focal point for growing the women’s game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hatton joined Rahm in celebration at the conclusion of LIV’s stop in Indiana last month. Europe’s captain, Luke Donald, had called Hatton to inform him of his qualification.“When I got back into the room, I fell across the bed sideways and fell asleep face down in that position,” Hatton said. “Then I had woken myself up, throwing up in that position. I had then fallen back asleep and then as I’d woken up I had sick all down my arms, both sides, all down my shirt.“I got off the bed and walked to the bathroom to look in the mirror and I had sick in my face, in my beard. How I set an alarm to make a flight in a few hours’ time, I don’t know. I don’t ever want to get to that state again to be honest.“I think that if you saw the room that we just sat in drinking, you’d be like: ‘What are you doing?’ But it ended up being fun. I fell asleep at the table and then I ended up getting woken up because everyone had basically left.”View image in fullscreenEurope’s Tyrrell Hatton after winning his singles match on the last day of the 2023 Ryder Cup in Rome.Photograph: Ettore Ferrari/EPAThe 33-year-old had ignored the adage about not mixing drinks. “I had six glasses of wine at dinner,” he said. “Then I had a double gin and tonic, drunk that at a very normal rate. And then Jon was deciding what he wanted and he said [the Italian liqueur] Disaronno sours and I was like: ‘Perfect, go on then.’ They go down very easily. Then I was starting the chant of basically getting someone to down it so every cocktail that then followed was a shot.“We then ran out of Disaronno. The guy at the bar made some hazelnut sour which wasn’t great and there was a few of them. Then there was a margarita and then there was a strawberry vodka thing. God, it was aggressive. It was horrible.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now, it has been upgraded to strangely uneven.A much-improved US got goals from Alejandro Zendejas and Folarin Balogun to beat a heavily rotated Japan side 2-0 at Lower.com Field in Columbus. The result lends some credence to Mauricio Pochettino’s insistence that the US’s recent subpar results were all part of a plan with a single target: arriving at the World Cup in peak form.The US head coach had been in a defiant mood almost from the moment the final whistle blew on hisside’s 2-0 loss to South Korea on Saturday– a game in which the US started reasonably well, but were continually undone by miscommunication at the back and a lack of clinical finishing up top. Pochettino turned heads when he told reporters afterward that he felt the US had been the better team overall – a view he doubled down on after arriving in Columbus, but with an additional edge.USMNT’s listless defeat to South Korea causes alarm bells again as World Cup loomsRead more“We need to understand that we need to have quite a roster and players that we need to know and give the possibility to play,” he said. “At the World Cup, it’s not a moment to make tests or to give the possibility to get experience. That is why you cannot be surprised.”Pochettino promised rotation and new ideas for evaluation, and that’s what he delivered: A 3-4-2-1 formation was deployed against Japan, with Chris Richards, Tim Ream and Tristan Blackmon making up the back three, 21-year-old Orlando starlet Alex Freeman at right wingback and the Columbus Crew’s Max Arfsten on the left. Cristian Roldan, who came as a late addition to the squad, started in central midfield alongside Tyler Adams, while Zendejas started alongside Christian Pulisic as dual No 10s behind Balogun at striker.In each line, a new arrangement gave opportunities for players who are unlikely to be starters in next summer’s World Cup, but who most certainly could play a significant role. In defense, Blackmon made up for a rough international debut on Saturday with a solid display, showing that he could at least be an option for a thin US center-back group. Out wide, Arfsten took advantage of being put in his best position by attacking at will with fewer defensive responsibilities, firing in the cross that led to the United States’ opener. Roldan was his steady, professional self next to Adams. And in attack, Zendejas showed off the work rate and quality of technique that make him relatively rare among the US options at winger.Steely and strangely divisive, Michael Bradley’s playing career cut to the id of US soccer fandomRead moreOf course, things were far from perfect. As he had against South Korea, Balogun failed to score early on, despite a series of point-blank chances within the first 20 minutes, with Japan goalkeeper Keisuke Osako doing well to make a couple saves amid that flurry. The US remained too passive on both sides of the ball, though not anywhere near as much as they were against the Koreans. And goalkeeper Matt Freese, while he kept a shutout and made some very nice saves, did not always look sure-handed or confident when dealing with crosses and set pieces. The starting goalkeeper for this team remains an open question.It must also be noted that Japan were without most of their usual starters, having used their first team in Saturday’s scoreless draw against Mexico. Still, the players on the field displayed all the hallmarks of head coach Hajime Moriyasu’s approach, attempting to use pace and skill to unbalance the US. The quality on the ball to make those moves count may have been lacking at times, but the rethought US backline played its role as well.The breakthrough came after half an hour, with Arfsten putting moves on Japan’s Henry Mochizuki, taking him down the left-wing before lofting in a well-paced ball that fell at just the right height for Zendejas. The Club América winger accepted the invitation with gusto, taking the ball right out of the air with a defender on his back and guiding it into the bottom corner of the far post.Zendejas celebrated by running to Arfsten, pointing at the Columbus Crew player to highlight to the home fans that their player had created what may prove an important breakthrough as the World Cup approaches.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Tuesday, though, the US did much better to keep up the pressure. The Americans sustained possession, refused to allow Japan out of their own half, and threatened to score even if the final product was not always there, or attempts were blocked by desperate defending. The Japanese helped the US as well – at one point, Pulisic was able to easily intercept a pass out of the back, but he was quickly swarmed and his effort was blocked out of bounds.That action seemed to wake up Pulisic from what had been another quiet performance in a US shirt. In the 48th minute, the Milan star did well to combine with Arfsten and Zendejas to fire on goal again, but the shot was blocked at the near post. Six minutes later, he went direct, cutting through the Japanese backline to latch on to a ball held up by Balogun, with Osako saving once again in what was an excellent performance for the keeper.In the end, Pochettino’s thesis may have best been proven by Jack McGlynn and Damion Downs, both of whom came on as substitutes and nearly added three outstanding goals: McGlynn from two trademark curling shots from outside the box (one saved, one off the bar), and Downs from a nice interchange through the middle that was saved by Osako. They were the type of chances that come from a team that, at long last, seemed comfortable with the task at hand, and capable of fulfilling it.Whether that feeling will extend to the first team on the biggest stage of all next summer remains to be seen.Explore more on these topicsUSAUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, Ellison’s lead was short-lived as the stock closed at $328, a rise of 36% valuing Ellison’s shareholding at $378bn and putting Musk back ahead.The pair sit comfortably ahead of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos.Ellison, 81, also has other sources of wealth, including a stake in electric carmaker Tesla, where Musk is chief executive, a sailing team, the Indian Wells Open tennis tournament, and an island in Hawaii, according to Bloomberg.Musk, an antagonist to various figures in the worlds of business and politics, has a close relationship with Ellison – who is often described as a mentor to the South Africa-born tech entrepreneur.Ellison sat on the board of Tesla between 2018 and 2022 and put $1bn intoMusk’s purchase of Twitter–since rebranded as X. According to Walter Isaacson’s biography of Musk, when the Tesla CEO asked Ellison to invest in Twitter, Ellison said he would put in a billion dollars or “whatever you recommend”. Musk is a frequent visitor to Ellison’s Hawaiian island, Lanai, according to the book.Ellison is also a supporter of Donald Trump and has regularly appeared alongside the US president at the White House, includingthe launch of the Stargate projectto invest $500bn in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US. Musk, a prominent backer of Trump’s 2024 election campaign, also had a strong relationship with Trump before itimploded earlier this year.Oracle accounts for the majority of Ellison’s wealth and its value has been boosted by demand from AI companies for its cloud services, which provide computing capacity for firms such as ChatGPT developer OpenAI, who need vast datacentres to power their technology.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was the UK’s deputy prime minister from 2010 to 2015, a position from which he was surely pulled in multiple directions as he attempted to bridge the divide between David Cameron’s Conservatives and his own Liberal Democrats. A few years later he chose another challenging role, serving as Meta’s vice-president and then president of global affairs from 2018 until January 2025, where he was responsible for bridging the very different worlds of Silicon Valley and Washington DC (as well as other governments). How to Save the Internet is Clegg’s report on how he handled that Herculean task, along with his ideas for how to make the relationships between tech companies and regulators more cooperative and effective in the future.The main threat that Clegg addresses in the book is not one causedbythe internet; it is the threattothe internet from those who would regulate it. As he puts it: “The real purpose of this book is not to defend myself orMetaor big tech. It is to raise the alarm about what I believe are the truly profound stakes for the future of the internet and for who gets to benefit from these revolutionary new technologies.”But in fact, a great deal of the book is devoted to a defence of Meta and big tech, and that defence begins by conflating the internet (which is widely loved) with social media (a subset of internet activity that evokes more ambivalence). In his discussion of the “techlash” – the sharp turn in public opinion against big tech in the late 2010s – he asks: “Would we choose to turn off certain technologies if we could? Would we deny ourselves the next innovation? Would we be better off without the freedoms of the open internet?”As it happens, I recently conducted a survey with the Harris Poll thatasked questions rather like theseto a nationally representative sample of young American adults – the very generation whose adolescence was grabbed and shaped by a few social media companies. We asked respondents to tell us, for various platforms and products, whether they wished each “was never invented”. The percentage of gen Z who regret the existence of the internet is low – 17%. For smartphones it is just 21%. But for the big social media platforms, regret is much higher, ranging from 34% for Instagram (which is owned by Meta) to 47% for TikTok and 50% for X. In our subsequentsurvey of parents, levels of regret about the existence of social media are higher still.Other researchershave made similar findings.In other words, yes, many of us would choose to turn off certain technologies if we could. Clegg frames the choice as a binary: open internet versus no internet. But the most serious problems are related to social media, which can be regulated without destroying “the internet”, and which is much harder to defend.Yet Clegg attempts to do so. In the first chapter he addresses the twin charges that social media has damaged global democracy and teen mental health. He acknowledges that both declined in the 2010s, but he claims that the declines merely correlate with the rise to dominance of social media, and are not caused by it. He cites academic studies, but his descriptions of them are Meta’s standard talking points, which ignore the manystudieson theother side. In fact, Clegg takes much of his defence word for word froma rebuttal essaythat Meta put out in 2022 in response toone of my essayslaying out the case that social media is harming advanced democracies.Clegg’s claim that the evidence of harm is merely correlational is contradicted by dozens of Meta employees, contractors, whistleblowers, and leaked documentsSo in this book, Clegg gives us Meta’s party line, but on teen mental health he once thought differently. Dozens of US state attorney generals are suing Meta, and the documents they have obtained show us who knew what, and when they knew it. Fromthe brieffiled by the attorney general of New Mexico we learn that on 27 August 2021, Clegg forwarded an email to Mark Zuckerberg from an employee requesting more resources to address teen mental health concerns. Clegg added his own plea at the top, saying that it was “increasingly urgent” to address “concerns about the impact of our products on young people’s mental health”. Clegg noted that the company’s “well-being work is both understaffed and fragmented”. Zuckerberg did not respond to the email.Clegg’s current claim that the evidence of harm is merely correlational, and that the correlations are too small to be taken seriously, is contradicted by dozens ofMeta employees,contractors,whistleblowers, andleakeddocumentsthat showotherwise. To take just one example, in abrieffrom the attorney general of Tennessee we learn about a 2019 study Meta commissioned on teenage mental health. The researchers alerted Meta that “[teens] are hooked despite how it makes them feel … Instagram is addictive, and time-spend on the platform is having a negative impact on mental health”. A bit later: “Instagram is the worst platform for mental health.”Turning to his proposals for how to save the internet, Clegg lays out two pillars: “radical transparency” and collaboration. On transparency, he urges tech companies to be more forthcoming about how their algorithms work and how they make their decisions. He warns: “If the masters of Silicon Valley refuse to open up, the choice will be taken out of their hands.”On collaboration, he calls for a “digital democracies alliance”, because he is concerned, rightly, that China has developed its technologies in ways that shore up its authoritarian system. He wants the democracies of the world to act together so that the internet might live up to the democracy-promoting visions so many of us shared in the 1990s.Would Clegg’s plan work? Transparency is great in theory, but I fear that it may be too late to apply these principles to the powerful companies that now control much of the internet. As tech journalist Kara Swisher memorablysaid in 2019, Zuckerberg and the other founders “built a city without street signs, without sewage, without police, without garbage men. Imagine that city. It’s not a good city to live in, but they collect all the rent on everything.” This is why scammers, sextortionists, drug dealers and political extremists thrive on these platforms and pose dangers to teens and to democracies that the big companies seem unable to fix. More transparency in 2026 may not be enough to repair the terrible urban design laid down 20 years ago.Big tech is picking apart European democracy, but there is a solution: switch off its algorithms | Johnny RyanRead moreAs for collaboration, it’s hard to imagine companies like Meta giving up their data or their sovereignty, especially now that the tech moguls have so much support from the Trump administration, and now that the Trump administration is so willing to apply pressure on other countries. If the masters of Silicon Valley refuse to collaborate, it’s just not clear to me that “the choice will be taken out of their hands”. By whom?The great biologist and ant expert EO Wilson once said about Marxism: “Good ideology. Wrong species.” After reading this, plus several of the many books about Meta’s unethical, careless, “break things” culture, as well as hundreds of pages from the 2021 document leak known as The Facebook Files and from ongoing lawsuits, I suggest we might say something similar about Clegg’s proposals: “Good plan. Wrong industry.”Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist and author of The Anxious Generation (Penguin).How to Save the Internet: The Threat to Global Connection in the Age of AI and Political Conflict by Nick Clegg is published Bodley Head (£25).

If you want to make your current iPhone cameras more versatile, these Moment lenses are a great way to do it. You’ll require acompatible caseand a$5 drop-in lens mountto securely snap them to your iPhone, but you’ll still spend way less than buying a $1,099 iPhone 17 Pro just for the cameras.Invest in a new caseView image in fullscreenAn iPhone 16 Pro.A fresh case can totally reinvigorate your old iPhone. It not only changes how it looks and feels, it can sometimes even tack on new features.For instance, I use thisTorras Casefor its magnetic kickstand when traveling. It comes in handy when I want to watch movies in the cramped confines of a coach seat, without holding my phone the whole time. Chronic texters can even add a Blackberry-like feel to the iPhone 16 with theClicks Keyboard case. For something a little slimmer, I favor Nomad’sLeather CaseorSport Case.

Switch it up!A new screen protector wouldn’t hurtMost screen protectors wear so slowly that you might not notice the glass starting to lose its gloss over time, or scratches accumulating. If a good scrub down with rubbing alcohol and a paper towel doesn’t restore its slickness and clarity, it might be time for replacement. I recommend thisNomad screen protectorfor its quality and ease of installation.The installation kit makes it super easy to install with no air bubbles, which can be a challenge with many competing models.

Apple fixed the Photos app, so it gives you 100% of the screen to view your media, the new Camera app layout is simpler to use, and web pages are easier to read in Safari.Perform a quick tune-upIf your current iPhone doesn’t quite run the way it used to, a few quick checks and settings tweaks can resolve many issues.Turn on Adaptive Power Mode in iOS 26. If your battery drains alarmingly quick, this may help. It automatically makes small performance adjustments when your iPhone usage is higher than normal, like lowering brightness and allowing some activities to take longer. You can go to Settings > Battery > Power Mode > Adaptive Power Mode to toggle it on.Spend time customizing your home screen. You’re probably tired of your stale home screen and don’t even realize it. Try adding widget stacks, creating folders and reorganizing your apps. Change that age-old wallpaper. Fine-tune the Notification Center. It won’t feel like the same phone anymore.Clean the USB-C port. The charging port tends to collect dust and dirt in your pocket, and after enough time a cable won’t fit in properly. You may notice finicky charging or even overheating as a result. To clean it, Applerecommendsusing a soft, dry, lint-free cloth, but if you really have a lot of impacted crud, I find a toothpick helps to pick it out. Just make sure you aren’t using anything too sharp, which might damage the port.Your old iPhone is perfectly fineMost newer iPhone owners, especially those with the iPhone 16 series, won’t see much improvement from an iPhone 17. Sure, it offers a more up-to-date feature set and an appealing design (to some), but you don’t need to give in to the hype.

It’s baffling, then, to see this latest game excel in so many areas while failing spectacularly on several of the genre’s most basic tenets.You play an unnamed traveller, the latest of many, sent to gather information about a devastating outbreak that transformed the citizens of a town called New Dawn into the sort of misshapen monsters that have become the staple of sci-fi-adjacent survival horror: contorted of limb, long of fang, and ample of slobber. As you explore the stark, often beautifully devastated aftermath of the outbreak, you search for places where you can travel back through time to when all hell was breaking loose, extracting persons of interest who may shed light on the disaster. A slow-burn story is revealed through the usual assortment of voice notes, missives and grim environmental clues (often, as is de rigueur, daubed in blood on walls).Sadly, this intriguing setup holds promise that Cronos never quite manages to keep, and by the end, through a series of baffling missteps, any sense of claustrophobic foreboding has been largely jettisoned in favour of profound, white-knuckled frustration. It led me to invent several exciting new compound swears to express my fury.View image in fullscreenThe moody blues … Cronos: The New Dawn.Photograph: Bloober TeamSuperb sound design does a hugely effective job of making you aware that there are things out there in the darkness, waiting, hungry. It’s only really when you encounter them that the game’s problems begin. One of the first beasties comes at you in a cramped interior space, and within three hits you’re dead. To defend yourself, all you have is essentially a spud gun and an aiming arm that appears to have strawpedoed six pints of cheap scrumpy, as the reticle sways everywhere. Eventually, you realise how to cheese your way through this skirmish, until you reach the next, where you die. And repeat. Variations of this annoying danse macabre persist throughout the entire 14-hour campaign.This frustration would be assuaged slightly if the game doled out enough ammunition and health-restoring items to make it feel as if you survived the last conflict by the skin of your teeth. But no. You will be sent into battle against a room lousy with monstrosities armed, with one hit’s worth of health, two bullets and no way to remedy the situation. Clear efforts to present a challenge soon start to give off the bloated cadaver-whiff of bad design.None of this is helped by an inventory system that even the most dedicated survival horror enthusiast would call Scroogily stingy, meaning you sometimes have to drop the precious three bullets you have in order to carry a keycard to the next area, or waste time commuting between save points to retrieve things from your stash.

It was finally released last Thursday after many years in development, and everybody is loving it. Hollow Knight was so popular that itcrashed multiple gaming storefronts. With continual game cancellations, expensive failures and layoffs at bigger studios, this is the kind of indie triumph the industry loves to celebrate at the moment. But Silksong hasn’t come out of nowhere, and its success would not be easily reproducible for any other game, indie or not.If you’re wondering what this game actuallyis, then imagine a dark, mostly underground labyrinth of bug nests and abandoned caverns that gradually yields its secrets to a determined player. The art style and sound are minimalist and creepy (though not scary) in a Tim Burton kind of way, the enemy bugs are fierce and hard to defeat, your player character is another bug with a small, sharp needle-like blade. It blends elements of Metroid, Dark Souls and older challenging platform games, and the unique aesthetic andperfectprecision of the controls are what make it stand out from a swarm of similar games. I rinsed the first Hollow Knight and I’m captivated by Silksong. I’ve spent 15 hours on it in three days, and it has made my thumbs hurt.The first Hollow Knight, released in 2017, was a slow-burn surprise hit. It was crowdfunded via Kickstarter in 2014, and Silksong was one of its stretch goals: originally it was supposed to be an expansion for the game, but as the studio’s co-founders, Ari Gibson and William Pellen, told Bloomberg in a recent interview, they were simply having too much fun to stop adding to it. Eventually, over seven years, it became the full-blown 20-plus-hour game that everyone is now enjoying.How could a small team afford to spend all this time on a single game? Well: the first Hollow Knight sold 15m copies. Any developer would dream of working with the resultant resources. Good games do take a long time to make, even when there’s no mismanagement or other development drama getting in the way. Most smaller-scale game developers are constantly seeking funding from investors or publishers who then (understandably) impose timescales far less generous than what Team Cherry has been working with.View image in fullscreenKnight’s tale … Hollow Knight: SilksongPhotograph: Team CherryThe other unique thing about Silksong is the way in which hype has built to a fever pitch over the last several years. The game became so mysterious that it turned into a meme: people have been spamming the chat and the comments of every single game showcase or news event with the words “Where’s Silksong?” for years. Presumably millions of people who never played the first Hollow Knight have been exposed to it in this way. I’ve never seen another indie game achieve this level of notoriety before it was even released. Such was Silksong’s legend that when its release date was announced a few weeks ago several other games were sent scurrying from its wake, delayed by their developers to avoid getting lost in the noise. Pity those games thatweren’tdelayed: asVGC points out, Atari released a similar game on the same day as Silksong (Adventure of Samsara) and it had only 12 concurrent players on Steam.As proven years ago byDuke Nukem Forever, no amount of free publicity could have saved Silksong if it had turned out to be rubbish. Thankfully, it’s excellent. It’s the kind of game whose appeal perhaps isn’t immediately evident; my partner, watching me spend a full hour trying to bounce my character off a series of punishingly placed balloons to ascend a horrible gauntlet of flying things, looked mildly concerned for my wellbeing. (Something in me just won’t let me quit when I come up against sadistically challenging games.) But as millions of players are now simultaneously discovering, it’s exactly the repeated failures that makes the rush of success so invigorating.One more thing about Silksong: spare a thought for the people who, in these moments where it feels like the whole world has been swept up by a game, simply do not enjoy it. Our games correspondent Keith Stuart is one of those unfortunates. “It is rare for me to be completely bewildered by a game’s success, and I know I’m in a tiny minority here, but I don’t get Hollow Knight or Silksong,” he says. “To me, they’re serviceable Metroidvania platformers with a very familiar alien organic aesthetic and tough boss battles. However, the games lack the glitchy, idiosyncratic charm of, say Cave Story or Animal Well, and the luscious visual confidence of, well, Castlevania or Super Metroid. I played Silksong for several hours over the weekend and, although it’s fine – it’sgood– I still felt as if I was being gaslit by the entire industry.”What to playView image in fullscreenCatch ’em all … Pokémon Legends Arceus.Photograph: NintendoGiven that every other game has run screaming from Silksong, there’s not much else to recommend this week – so I’m here with a belated recommendation forPokémon Legends Arceus, a game I slept on when it was released in 2022. This is largely because it was really ropey then, chugging along as you ran around its open fields searching for creatures; its rubbish performance undermined the freedom and possibility the designers clearly intended. But it runs so much better on the Switch 2.Casting you as a Pokémon field researcher rather than a trainer, it has you exploring whole regions full of free-roaming Pokémon, sneaking up on them to throw Pokéballs or hiding in long grass to avoid doing battle with intimidating alpha creatures. The semi-historical setting is a welcome novelty, too – you’re thrown back in time to an Edo-esque period where humans and Pokémon are just learning how they might live together. I have been playing this every evening with my sons, both of them excitedly leafing through their Pokémon encyclopedia books every time we spot a new creature. It satisfies my ageing-millennial draw towards bird-watching and my inner child’s enduring love for Pokémon.Available on:Nintendo Switch/Switch 2Estimated playtime:30-plus hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenThe name’s … 007 First Light.Photograph: IO InteractiveThe first gameplay footage of Hitman developer IO Interactive’s Bond game,007 First Light, debuted last week. There’sa whole half-hour of action, spycraft and (naturally) driving, and it’s looking great. Admittedly, my only connection to Bond is GoldenEye on the N64, but I am intrigued to play a Bond game that has you mingling at parties and digging for information as well as shooting at bad guys and getting into car chases.Earlier this year, an electronics reseller came into possession of atrove of development consoles and cartridgesfrom Sega’s old Basingstoke offices, bought as part of a clearance. In July, he was raided by police,reports Time Extension. The seller was arrested and the collection of prototype games and consoles were seized. This has sparked a fascinating series of events, as the legal ownership of these pieces of gaming history remains unclear; the electronics reseller, who says he has received no clarification from Sega or the police, suspects that they may already have been destroyed.Take-Two was in talks to rescue the recently cancelled Xbox reboot of spy gamePerfect Dark,reports Bloomberg– but unfortunately Microsoft still cancelled the project and its developer, the Initiative, has been shuttered. Co-developer Crystal Dynamics also had layoffs. Crystal Dynamics has had some terrible luck. After two good Tomb Raider games in 2013 and 2015, it released a middling third one (Shadow of the Tomb Raider) in 2018 and an Avengers game that famously underperformed in 2020. It was then sold to the notorious Embracer Group in 2022, and has struggled to get an original game over the line ever since.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One of those people was readerCordelia, who asks:“How do you feel about using walkthroughs and hints when a game becomes a bit sticky? I’ll be honest, I feel a bit guilty about it.”This is an apt question for this week’s edition becauseHollow Knight: Silksongis really,reallyhard, and giving in and looking up a map or Googling for an answer could be the difference between persevering and giving up on the game. I’m used to playing games without any help: because I’m often playing games for review, thereareno walkthroughs. But I am most certainly not above reading a walkthrough, and I especially appreciate the guide writers out there who’ll give you a nudge in the right direction before just straight-up showing you the answer.Many modern games are communal and collaborative, and sharing experiences and hints is a natural part of that; few people could get through something likeDark Soulsalone, and indeed the game is designed to facilitate cooperation, because it takes the edge off what would otherwise be extreme difficulty. I often look up walkthroughs and guides after I’m done playing a game, too, to see what I might have missed, or whether there’s some secret ending; I didn’t touch a guide while I was playingBlue Princebecause I knew it would spoil my fun, but the second I got to the end I was boning up on all the extra puzzles and content that I definitely wasn’t going to have time to experience.I also look up guides when a game is scary: I’m not ashamed to admit that I played the firstLast of Uswith a text walkthrough so that I knew when fungal zombies were going to jump out at me, and when I could relax. And I also used to rely on guides back when I was a teenager, when I’d import games from Japan but couldn’t read what the hell I was supposed to be doing. Bless the tireless efforts of the GameFAQs authors of the past, who got me through several Japanese PS2 RPGs.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterAction gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For anyone who doubted Benjamin Netanyahu’s commitment to the forever war he unleashed after 7 October, the attempt to wipe out Hamas’s ceasefire negotiation team in Doha offered grim confirmation that peace – and the return of Israeli hostages – is low on Mr Netanyahu’s list of current priorities.Just how close Hamas’s leadership was to endorsing ceasefire proposals backed by Donald Trump – which were being discussed in the capital of an established US ally – is unclear. However, Mr Netanyahu’s strike has ensured that its negotiators will not agree to sit round a table again anytime soon. Israel swiftlystatedthat the attack was in response to theHamas-claimedshootingin Jerusalem on Monday, in which six people died. But it also occurred as the Israeli militaryorderedthe complete evacuation of Gaza City, ahead of a full-scale invasion that will bring further death and destruction to a starving, traumatised population.It could not be plainer that ending the suffering is not compatible with the goals of Mr Netanyahu, and the far-right allies on which his government depends. But faced with such contemptuous intransigence – and growingevidencethat those goals include establishing a “Greater Israel” stretching beyond 1967borders– the west’s response is pusillanimous and painfully inadequate.As Mr Trump issues ignored deadlines and empty exhortations topeaceon social media, Mr Netanyahu is deploying US-derived military might to act with impunity, unilaterally striking targets when and where he wishes. Yet though the president criticised Israel after Tuesday’s attack for violating the sovereignty of a US ally, he also made a point of approving the general aim of eliminating Hamas. For Mr Trump, it appears that there are no truly red lines for Israel’s extremist government to cross.Against that alarming and dangerous backdrop, it is imperative that Sir Keir Starmer and other European leaders seek to exert greater pressure both on Washington and Israel itself. Before controversially meeting the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, on Wednesday, Sir Keir loftilyinsistedthat abandoning diplomatic efforts towards a lasting peace deal would amount to “student politics”. But Israel’s attempted assassination of participants in that process, in Doha this week, should lend a certain perspective on the value of words alone.As a recent report by MPs on the foreign affairs select committeeconcluded, Britain must be far bolder and tougher in the measures it is willing to take to isolate a government whose war crimes are taking place in plain sight. The European Union must also follow up familiar rhetoric with consequential action, designed to deliver a meaningful economic impact. Ultimately, only the US can force Israel’s prime minister to bring his genocidal campaign in Gaza to an end. But Europe’s passivity has played its part in strengthening Mr Netanyahu’s conviction that he can shape the Middle East’s future according to the extremist designs of his far-right cabinet colleagues.Formal recognitions of Palestinian statehood, some of which willtake placeat this month’s United Nations general assembly, carry a welcome symbolism. But as Mr Netanyahu’s bombs destabilise the wider Gulf region, Gaza’s civilian population braces for the worst once again, and the effective annexation of parts of the West Bank continues, symbolism is not nearly enough.Explore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionQatarHamasIsrael-Gaza warGazaBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Less than a week ago, a 26-nation“coalition of the willing”led by France and the UK announced an agreement on a “reassurance force”, intended to help guarantee Ukraine’s security after any ceasefire in Russia’s relentless war of aggression. Vladimir Putin has stepped up the nightly bombardment of Ukraine in defiance of Donald Trump’s efforts to broker a peace deal, and rejected any presence of European forces on the ground.The Russian defence ministry said it hadno intention to engageany targets on Polish territory. But the incursion by 19 drones, several of which were shot down, looks like a deliberate test of the west’s political will to step up support for Kyiv at a time when European allies are unsure how far they can rely on US backing, given Trump’s erratic leadership. It may also have been intended to strike fear into European populations, fuelling anti-war sentiment fanned by populist parties.Several European Nato allies were involved in helping the Polish air force intercept the drone intrusion, including an Italian radar plane, Dutch fighter aircraft and German Patriot missiles, according to Nato.This was not the first violation of Nato airspace since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but it was by far the largest. It also targeted a country that has been the main hub for western arms deliveries to Kyiv, as well as a leader in European rearmament. Armed Russian drones have landed (harmlessly) inLatviaandLithuania, and a stray Ukrainian air defence missilekilled two Poles in 2022.Russian aircraft and naval vessels regularly probe western reactions by flying very close to – and occasionally in and out of – the airspace and territorial waters of Baltic, North Sea and Black Sea countries. In a cat-and-mouse game, Nato nations frequently scramble planes to escort Russian aircraft away, or send naval vessels to shadow ships sailing close to key energy pipelines and underwater cables. Similarly,Finland has detainedandSweden boardedChinese boats suspected of having deliberately damaged underwater infrastructure by dragging their anchors along the seabed.However, this was the first time a Nato member has had to shoot down Russian drones over its territory since the war in Ukraine began. “This situation brings us the closest we have been to open conflict since the second world war,” the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk,said in a sombre addressto his parliament.Poland invoked Nato’s article 4, under which an ally can request consultations “whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened”. In astatement after talks in Brussels, Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, said allies expressed solidarity with Poland and denounced Russia’s “reckless behaviour”.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, was quick to blame Putin personally. In a last-minute addition to her“state of the union” addressto the European parliament, she said: “Just today we have seen a reckless and unprecedented violation of Poland’s and Europe’s airspace by more than 10 Russian Shahed drones. Europe stands in full solidarity with Poland. Putin’s message is clear and our response must be clear too.”European leaders will doubtless seize on the Russian incursion to press Trump to commit to providing support for a European-led reassurance force forUkraine. They will also point to the incident as justification for the rearmament drive they have launched to counter the growing Russian threat to European security. Nato allies may well send planes and missile batteries to bolster Poland’s air defences.Behind closed doors, there is likely to be sharper debate about how aggressively Nato should respond to Russian violations and other acts of hybrid warfare such as sabotage and cyber-attacks. Nordic and Baltic members are pressing for a more robust response – for instance, empowering Nato air patrols to shoot down any crewed Russian aircraft that enter their airspace – to demonstrate Nato’s solidarity and resolve to go to war, if any of its nations is attacked. They also want European and US allies to supply Ukraine with longer-range missiles and free its hand to strike deep inside Russian territory. Ukraine itself, meanwhile, is urging Nato countries to shoot down Russian missiles in its airspace from their own soil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He lives with my mum, who is also in her 80s, in a two-bedroom apartment in Canberra. My mum has multiple sclerosis, which makes looking after a fit, otherwise healthy man with Alzheimer’s very challenging.Dad cannot think in any structured way. He can’t really understand what’s going on around him and he can’t follow verbal instructions. He’s too big and strong to wrestle in and out of clothes, the way you would with a small child, but he has to be wrestled in and out of clothes fairly often because he also doesn’t really understand when he needs to go to the toilet.He likes to go out for a walk every morning and many afternoons, but he can’t go by himself because he has no idea where he is and how to get home. My mum can’t go with him due to her multiple sclerosis, which also means she gets very tired and needs a lot of rest which, when you live with a six-foot-tall toddler who really wants to go outside, is impossible.Labor’s new home care plan could price some elderly people out of laundry and showering help, watchdog warnsRead moreThe situation is clearly not sustainable. While they get support every morning – someone comes to feed, shower and dress Dad – for the rest of the day, most days, Mum looks after him, which is wearing her out. My brother has his own family with its own issues (a classic “sandwich” situation) and I live in a different state. So we decided it was time to put Dad into care. This was an emotionally difficult decision but once we had made it we congratulated ourselves on being calm and sensible and planning ahead, rather than waiting for an emergency.It turns out there areno rooms in aged carefor people like my dad. We filled in forms, we made phone calls, we waited on wait lists for months, but nothing happened. Eventually, one day, I burst into tears talking to the manager of a home, and for whatever reason he was moved to help me. A place was found. We filled in more forms. Dad was admitted and we all felt a horrible mix of guilt and relief.The next day, when I went in to visit him, the home manager said they would not be able to keep him: he walked around a lot and couldn’t understand instructions (including very important instructions about which room was his and which rooms he shouldn’t go into), and that was disruptive. They didn’t have the staff or the skills to care for him. But, I said, we told you he has dementia: this is dementia. They shrugged and said, we can’t look after him.For two weeks we tried to get him into another home in their network, one that did have the staff and the skills, but there were no beds. Then for the next two weeks, while they sent us emails telling us all the reasons Dad was no good (while I writhed with guilt about him going into other people’s rooms and frightening them), we tried every other home in Canberra, explaining it was an emergency. There were no beds.We called the government’s aged care support service and asked them what to do. They said, check the room finder on our website: look, there are beds available in all these homes! But I have called all those homes, I told them, and there are no beds. Wow, they said: they should update their website! I agreed that that would be good, and that was the end of our conversation.Several of the people we spoke to said you should put your dad in the hospital. If you do that, they assured us, he will be very quickly admitted into a suitable aged care home. We didn’t want to put Dad in the hospital. Dad fears and loathes hospitals, and I felt like even a few days in hospital would be the end of him. Never mind that one of the reasons everyone’s surgery keeps getting delayed and ambulances line up for hours outside emergency rooms is that hospital beds are full of old people who have nowhere safe to go.In the end, though, we couldn’t think of any other options so we called the hospital. No, they said, you cannot just drop your dad off here and expect us to look after him; which, I thought, was fair enough.The other week the home finally kicked my dad out and he is now back with my mum. He is great – full of enthusiasm for life, cheerful and affectionate. But imagine spending all day every day with someone who cannot sit still, who cannot stop talking, who doesn’t ever listen to anything you say, who cannot make sense, who will not take his shoes off or put them on. If you are the parent of a young child, you know what this is like – in this case, though, the child is bigger and stronger than you are, and people in the street do not look at him and say he is cute. His Alzheimer’s will get worse, my mum will get weaker, neither of them are safe and nothing will be done until there is an emergency. And that will be too late.Jane Rawson is a novelist, essayist, editor and PhD student.

But one quirk aboutWalesI really dislike is how increasingly often I hear it said that its inhabitants should have less say over their lives. As if any people would ever wantlesspower.Time and again you hear this view espoused – most recently by Reform UK’s sole member of the Welsh Senedd, Laura Anne Jones. In her former incarnation as a minor Tory, Jones entered the public consciousness in Wales only a few times. Once was whenshe used a racist slurto describe Chinese people. Another was when she defected from the Conservatives to join Reform in July because she “just suddenly felt that the Conservative party was unrecognisable”. I am sure this had nothing to do with the fact that the Tories are facing near wipeout in Wales in next May’s election. And what has Jones done since in her role as the lone Reform MS? Well, at the first Reform party conference this week she quickly announced that the party is “not ruling out” abolishing the Senedd.Jones is not the first politician to consider abolishing Wales’s parliament, the foundation of which was the culmination of decades of campaigning and a declaration of Welsh nationhood. Less than a year ago the then leader of the Welsh Tories,Andrew RT Davies, was ousted after he flirted with an anti-devolution stance. Just a month ago former Reform MS Rupert Lowe called for the “Assembly” (it hasn’t been called that for half a decade)to be abolished. Though why the MP for Great Yarmouth felt his opinion was worth anything on this topic is a mystery. When I spoke to Lee Andersonlast yearat the Reform party’s Welsh conference he told me that he was “not a fan” of devolution and that it was a “disaster” but at least it will give his party a chance to “win lots of seats”at the next election“which they can use to their advantage”. It is clear from the many conversations I have had with people within Reform, that they see the Senedd as a chanceto massively increasetheir party’s resources ahead of a future general election.These comments underscore an arrogance, hypocrisy and disdain that is all too often applied to Wales and our hard-won right to manage many of our own affairs. Devolution for Cymru was introduced in 1999 after a referendum in 1997 in which the people of Walesvoted narrowlyin favour of it. Then in 2011 there was another referendum on whether the then National Assembly of Wales should receive full law-making powers in the 20 areas over which it had control. This second referendum was much more conclusive, withmore than 63%in favour.In the last Senedd election the anti-devolution party Abolish gotless than 2%of the vote. The Welsh have repeatedly voted for devolution in referendums. It seems that for Jones et al, it is fine to dismiss the democratic will of the people as long as they are Welsh.That I find this annoying (to say the least) doesn’t mean that I think there are no issues with how devolution is now constructed – there absolutely are. The state ofWelsh public servicesis a national embarrassment. I fail to see how anyone can look at Welsh Labour’s stewardship of Wales and conclude it is anything other than a failure. You can’t have the worst performing NHS and the worst education results after two and a half decades in power and pretend this is working well.When polled, a not insignificant minority of people in Wales have saidthey want to scrap our Senedd. I totally understand why some people in Wales look at devolution and say, “this is not working”. But the answer isn’t to scrap it. If your car breaks down you don’t say, “oh well, better just walk from now on”. You repair or upgrade it.The argument seems to be that because Welsh public services are bad, the Welsh should no longer manage their own affairs. This attitude underscores how Wales is viewed within the union. If Scotland’s government performs badly, the argument from (often London-based) commentators is rarely, “let’s abolish the Scottish parliament”. It is rather, “the Scots need to get rid of the SNP”. When Westminster presides over abysmal waiting lists or pays billions onCovid contractsto the mates of cabinet ministers, no one says, “let’s abolish Westminster”. They argue to reform it, or change the voting system, but not that we should abolish UK democracy altogether. Only in the case of Wales is it apparently acceptable to say that a UK nation is uniquely unqualified to make decisions about its own future.What is frustrating about Wales having to continually justify its right to its own parliament is that it distracts from the fact that the system absolutely needs change. Be under no illusions: you could put the most competent government in history in power at Cardiff Bay and it would still struggle to tackle Wales’s challenges. The system currently sets Wales up to fail. While the Welsh government has a £23bn budget and control over our health service, it has less borrowing power than a council. It also has strict limits on how much of its budget it is able to carry over, which artificially hamstrings the Welsh government and punishes prudent spending.Back in 2023 the Welsh government asked the Tories in Westminster to be allowed to carry over an extra £150m thatit hadn’t spent. This was rejected and the Treasury took that money away from Wales. While you could blame the Welsh government for its poor financial planning, this system of funding is bonkers. How can any government operate effectively in these circumstances?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pushed by YouTube influencers Logan Paul and KSI, this brightly coloured energy drink sparkeda buying frenzythat left parents puzzled. Not only by the high price, or the resale sites that took advantage of scarcity and acted as a kind of ticket tout for the beverages, but also the desperation that children and teens apparently felt to consume this product. It’s not just Prime. Shops are full of energy drinks, often marketed at young people.In response to growing health concerns over their consumption, the UK government recently announced that the sale of energy drinks to anyone under the age of 16 will bebanned in England. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, pointed to their links to obesity, poor concentration and disrupted sleep patterns as key reasons for the policy. He said: “Energy drinks might seem harmless but the sleep, concentration and wellbeing of today’s kids are all being impacted, while high-sugar versions damage their teeth and contribute to obesity.” Sodas fall into this category too, but at the core of the debate about energy drinks is one common stimulant that few of us think twice about: caffeine.Caffeine is a psychoactive drug that activates the central nervous system. While most adults can consume it in reasonably moderate amounts without harm (think of coffee, tea or dark chocolate) children and adolescents process it differently. Their developing bodies are more sensitive to certain drugs because in those years, the brain is considered “plastic” – easily moulded by environmental factors. And there is a good body of evidence that suggests younger brains are seriously affected by caffeine.One of the most robust studies comes from the US, where the data of almost 12,000 children aged nine and 10 was analysed from the adolescent brain cognitivedevelopment study. It followed these children over time to look at the impact of various substances, including caffeine, on brain performance including vocabulary comprehension, reading decoding, inhibitory control, working memory, cognitive flexibility, processing speed and episodic memory. They found that caffeine intake negatively impacted all seven cognitive measures, even adjusting for age, gender, sleep and socioeconomic status.The US study’s authors are quite clear in their conclusions, noting: “We advise parents to control their children’s intake of beverages with caffeine to reduce the risk of interference with normal cognitive development.” Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatricsstrongly advisesthat individuals under 18 avoid caffeinated energy or sports drinks.Studies fromAustralia,Portugaland south-westEnglandshow similar negative impacts on brain development and mood.But this is also about how much we consume, right? So how much caffeine is detrimental to health? The European Food Safety Authority’s guidance is that a caffeine dose above 3mg per kilogram of body weighthas adverse effectsin children (and adults). That means a 10-year-old weighing 30kg could experience cognitive impact, sleep disruption or an elevated heart rate from just 90mg of caffeine. Yet most energy drinks contain significantly more than that. For example, a single can of Prime has 200mg, compared with an eight-ounce cup of coffee (95mg) or tea (50mg), a can of Coke (34mg) or a can of Diet Coke (46mg).The high levels of caffeine in energy drinks and the risk to child and adolescent health are at the core of England’s proposed ban. Some will argue that this should be a matter for parents, not government intervention. But that argument breaks down in the face of marketing, especially on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram. Some of these products are aggressively promoted online, often by influencers, who children may listen to more than their parents or teachers. The packaging blurs the line between being sports drinks (ie something that’s good for performance and your body) and energy drinks; children can buy the latter easily on their way to school or during lunch breaks. Expecting parents – individually – to control this is both unrealistic and unfair.Of course, even if they were banned for young people, parents could just buy these drinks and give them to children. We know that enforcement can be patchy. But for parents short on time and influence, the proposed ban signals that these drinks are not harmless, and that just because something is popular doesn’t mean it’s safe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Parents and consumers rely on the state to sift through scientific evidence, assess safety and regulate products that may do harm. When that process works well, it protects public health and allows us all to have one less thing to think about when choosing what to eat and drink in stores. The decision to ban energy drinks for under-16s shows that governments – grounded in evidence, informed by the medical community and acting in the public interest – can legislate in a positive way for people’s health.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghExplore more on these topicsHealthOpinionFood & drink industryChildrenFamilyParents and parentingFoodcommentShareReuse this content"

With 399 MPs and a working majority of 156, why should he?One reason is that those numbers mark a high tide of anti-Tory feeling that receded as soon as Rishi Sunak’s rotten administration was swept away. Voters from diverse places with disparate grievances embraced Starmer’s promise of change, often uncertain what it meant in practice. They needed reasons to be glad of the choice they had made and haven’t found them. Support for the government has tanked as a result.Labour MPs are miserable. There is disaffection in every faction. It afflicts even the cadre of ultra-loyal “Starmtroopers” whose selection as parliamentary candidates was supposed to guarantee a compliant Commons. Ambitious newbies who thought they were embarking on a political career are doubtful of survival at the next election. They are less easily induced to obedience by whips.This is another reason why Starmer needs to get into the bridge-building trade. Labour, like all parties, is a coalition of divergent opinions held together by an intuitive sense of common history and purpose. A leader can alienate some supporters for the sake of election success if pragmatic compromise doesn’t look like dissolution of core principle, and as long as it works. Starmer passed those tests in opposition. Now, not so much.Cabinet changes hastened byAngela Rayner’s resignationare supposed to consolidate the prime minister’s grip on policy, promoting people who will drive the Starmer agenda harder and faster. Shabana Mahmood is tasked with getting immigration, legal and irregular, under control with more alacrity than Yvette Cooper. Pat McFadden must transform “economically inactive” benefit claimants into productive workers by some method that eluded Liz Kendall. That will free up money for Rachel Reeves, one of the few cabinet members not to have been shuffled, to invest in public services and growth-boosting infrastructure. This is “phase two” of the project, when the public should start to notice delivery of the change that was promised.To disgruntled Labour MPs it looks like doubling down on a failing strategy. Some discontent will be flushed out in the competition tofill the deputy party leadership postthat Rayner vacated. The belief that tax raids on hoarded wealth can obviate the need for painful budget cuts will get an airing. So will the view that Reeves’s fiscal rules are more disposable than she (or the bond market she can feel breathing down her neck) supposes.That debate won’t settle the bigger strategic problem that Starmer’s main rival isNigel Farage, and that Reform UK’s preferred campaign issue lures the prime minister ever-further from his party’s comfort zone. Labour can’t afford to ignore public demand for immigration control. But Starmer’s apparent acceptance of Farage’s argument – that Britain is swamped with marauding foreigners – drives demoralised progressive voters elsewhere, to the Liberal Democrats, the Greens or the new party headed by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana.The Labour leadership has been slow to recognise a threat on that flank. Smaller parties are seen as unserious, not contenders for power, receptacles for midterm protest votes. When a general election focuses attention on the question of who should run the country, and the choice is binary – Starmer or Farage – the raised stakes bring a different calculus into play.That’s the theory, and there is evidence to support it. The Labour leader’s approval ratings are abysmal, but he beats his Reform counterpart on the question ofpreferred candidate to be prime minister.Fear of the alternative is an incomplete plan to woo voters who have fled leftwards. The missing component is a sense of the country moving in the right direction. There is time to make that happen. But squandering the first year, when public goodwill and party discipline were likely to be at their peak, was not an encouraging start.Large parties have always counted on support from people who hold their noses and vote for the candidate they don’t like to obstruct the one they despise. But that dynamic might be changing in an era of alienation from all mainstream political institutions.The veteran pollster Peter Kellnerdraws the distinctionbetween political “consumers” and “devotees” of a party. The former make a transactional choice. The latter connect with their preferred party on an emotional level, as validation of identity. Green and Reform supporters tend to be devotees. Labour’s 2024 election win was the aggregate of many consumer choices. If people don’t like the taste of what they are being served, they won’t stay loyal to the brand.To get a sense of what that decay looks like if not reversed, Labour MPs can glance across the Commons at the pitiful state of theConservatives. Kemi Badenoch has not sparked the interest of non-aligned political consumers, and the spirit of radical rightwing devotion now fires Reform. The Tory leader shows no interest in winning back the scores of former heartland seats that elected Lib Dem MPs last year, nor any understanding of why that happened.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some Tory MPs expect a tipping point next year, probably after local and devolved elections, when it becomes clear that Farage can offer better prospects of a seat and maybe even a return to power. Then a trickle of defections becomes a flood.The era in which any party can poll higher than the low 30s may be over. An electoral system that gave a perverse picture of national preferences when there was a two-party duopoly goes completely haywire when four or five parties score in the high teens or 20s.Last year, Labour campaign strategists shrewdly gamed the caprice of first past the post to convert a modest 33.7% share into a huge majority. Farage couldplausibly replicate that trick. To become prime minister, he doesn’t need to be embraced by the nation, just preferred by enough people in enough seats, and for his rivals to take big enough chunks out of each other’s support.Just as feasibly, he could be thwarted by the anyone-but-Farage majority. Lib Dems might continuesiphoning moderate ex-Tory votersaway from Badenoch’s moribund party. Ed Davey would be in a position to enable a second Starmer term, even if Labour sheds scores of seats.These are speculations about a distant realm. Last year’s election feels long ago. The one before that seemed to herald a decade ofBoris Johnson hegemony. He was gone within three years. Not much is predictable in this era of fractured trust and fragmented allegiance. Except perhaps that politics won’t be contained by the old party lines and all leaders, including the current prime minister, should get into the business of building coalitions.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerGeneral election 2024Nigel FarageReform UKKemi BadenochConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

But, weather permitting, enthusiastic swimmers in Paris will be able to prolong that holiday feeling into September – by taking a dip in the River Seine.For nearly 100,000 swimmers, one of the highlights of this summer in the city has been being able to take a splash in the cool river waters at one of the three free public bathing spots, made available this year for the first time in over a century.They are the visible culmination of a huge, multiyear river cleanup operation that goes far beyond urban swimming, giving other cities a masterclass in looking after their waterways and adapting to the climate crisis. Paris, one of Europe’s most densely populated cities, has experiencedextreme heatwavesin recent summers, and is already preparing for a 50C scenario.Around the world, governments are scrambling to protect scarce water resources as temperatures rise.One part of adapting to rising temperatures is identifying and promoting a network of “cool islands”, such as bathing spots or green spaces, that can help people cool off in extreme heat.In recent years,Parisand its surrounding authorities have invested €1.4bn in infrastructure improvements to improve the water quality of the Seine. Sewerage systems have been upgraded, and an enormous, 50,000 cubic metres reservoir, the bassin d’Austerlitz, has been built to stock excess rainwater during storms, reducing the amount of untreated water that flows into the river, improving water quality and encouraging biodiversity. The Seine in and around Paris now contains more than 30 different species of fish, up from just three in the 1970s.Paris is not the first European city to introduce or bring back river-swimming sites – try Amsterdam’s River Amstel and, if you’re heading toBasel in Switzerland, don’t forget your Wickelfisch bag – but it’s certainly the most visible, helped by last year’s river-based Olympic and Paralympic triathlons. “The idea was to have a concrete legacy that would allow us on an environmental level to stop polluting the river, to improve water quality to allow for ecosystems to redevelop – and to stop turning our backs on the Seine,” says Pierre Rabadan, deputy for sports and the Seine at the Paris mayor’s office.Better connecting citydwellers to their river underscores the importance of looking after waterways, a vital part of adapting to the climate crisis. Achieving all that in Paris took political will, coupled with a readiness to invest in projects benefiting the environment and people’s quality of life. That’s something that has been in evidence over the course of the Socialist party’s Anne Hidalgo’s 11-year term as mayor.Streets around many schools are now becoming car-free. Hundreds of kilometres of cycle lanes have unfurled across the Paris streets through the Plan Vélo, while abandoned spaces have been turned into rooftop farms and living walls under theParisculteurs urban agriculture scheme. Since 2020, more than 100,000 trees have been planted in the city. The hugely successful Paris Plages scheme, put in place by Hidalgo’s predecessor Bertrand Delanoë, has seen formerly traffic-clogged roads along the river’s banks transformed into summer beaches.For the Seine cleanup, the pressure of a globally visible deadline was a catalyst, and last summer Paris met its initial goal, of water (just) clean enough for the Olympic and Paralympic triathlons. What they have managed to achieve could now act as a blueprint for other European cities, with the right political will. Rabadan says he has been talking to his counterparts in other cities inEurope– and beyond – about how to replicate the Paris river-swimming model.Different cities will face different logistical challenges, but Paris shows that repairing the damage industrialisation and urbanisation have inflicted on waterways can – and must – be achieved. And while it hasn’t been cheap, the costs of doing nothing in the long term would be greater for the planet and for society: upriver, the Seine provides a significant portion of the Paris region’s drinking water.Last year, London mayor Sadiq Khanpledged to make part of the Thames swimmableby 2034, although the Port of London authority has warned that swimming in the tidal parts of the river will always be dangerous, highlighting just one complication London will face. But the Paris project shows that efforts can pay off. “Symbolically, we have shown that if it’s possible in Paris, it’s possible elsewhere,” Rabadan says.Watched over by lifeguards, local residents and tourists alike, equipped with regulation yellow inflatable floats, have been flocking to the three swimming sites – the Bras Marie, near the Île Saint-Louis in central Paris, Bercy, farther east, and Grenelle, over towards the Eiffel Tower – to plunge into the river. (Though two have now closed for the winter, Bercyremains openuntil 14 September and, weather permitting, for a final weekend on 20-21 September.)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Paris is already planning the three sites for next summer (the most central Bras Marie site will be adjusted to allow for longer opening hours without affecting riverboat traffic).Twenty other areas in the greater Paris region have applied to open their own bathing sites and, inspired by Paris, elsewhere in France activists are organising mass swims to call for their own stretches of water to be made swimmable. The future of the Seine bathing project – and the river itself – looks bright. Now other cities across Europe and beyond should be equally ambitious.Helen Massy-Beresford is a journalist based in ParisExplore more on these topicsParisOpinionSwimmingRiversFranceClimate crisisEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

It’s brazen theft and must be stoppedAnna Funder andJulia PowlesIf we don’t refuse and resist, not just our culture but our democracy will be irrevocably diminishedWed 10 Sep 2025 02.59 EDTShareToday’s large-scale AI systems are founded on what appears to be an extraordinarily brazen criminal enterprise: the wholesale, unauthorised appropriation of every available book, work of art and piece of performance that can be rendered digital.In the scheme of global harms committed by the tech bros – the undermining of democracies, the decimation of privacy, the open gauntlet to scams and abuse – stealing one Australian author’s life’s work and ruining their livelihood is a peccadillo.But stealingallAustralian books, music, films, plays and art as AI fodder is a monumental crime againstallAustralians, as readers, listeners, thinkers, innovators, creators and citizens of a sovereign nation.Watering down Australia’s AI copyright laws would sacrifice writers’ livelihoods to ‘brogrammers’ | Tracey SpicerRead moreThe tech companies are operating as imperialists, scouring foreign lands whose resources they can plunder. Brazenly. Without consent. Without attribution. Without redress. These resources are the products of our minds and humanity. They are our culture, the archives of our collective imagination.If we don’t refuse and resist, not just our culture but our democracy will be irrevocably diminished. Australia will lose the wondrous, astonishing, illuminating outputs of human creative toil that delight us by exploring who we are and what we can be. We won’t know ourselves any more. The rule of law will be rendered dust. Colony indeed.Tech companies have valorised the ethos “move fast and break things”, in this case, the law and all it binds. To “train” AI, they started by “scraping” the internet for publicly available text, a lot of which is rubbish. They quickly realised that to get high-quality writing, thinking and words they would have to steal our books. Books, as everyone knows, are property. They are written, often over years, licensed for production to publishers and the rental returns to authors are called royalties. No one will write them if they can be immediately stolen.Why would you work if your work can be stolen, degraded and made available for free?Copyright law rightfully has its critics, but its core protections have enabled the flourishing of book creation and the book business, and the wide (free but not “for free”) transmission of ideas. Australian law says you can quote a limited amount from a book, which must be attributed (otherwise it’s plagiarism). You cannot take a book, copy it entirely and become its distributor. That is illegal. If you did, the author and the publisher would take you to court.Yet what is categorically disallowed for humans is being seriously discussed as acceptable for the handful of humans behind AI companies and their (not yet profit-making) machines.To the extent they care, tech companies try to argue the efficiency or necessity of this theft rather than having to negotiate consent, attribution, appropriate treatment and a fee, as copyright and moral rights require. No kidding. If you are setting up a business, in farming or mining or manufacturing or AI, it will indeed be more efficient if you can just steal what you need – land, the buildings someone else constructed, the perfectly imperfect ideas honed and nourished through dedicated labour, the four corners of a book that ate a decade.Under the banner of progress, innovation and, most recently, productivity, the tech industry’s defence distils to “we stole because we could, but also because we had to”. This is audacious and scandalous, but it is not surprising. What is surprising is the credulity and contortions of Australia’s political class in seriously considering retrospectively legitimising this flagrantly unlawful behaviour.The Productivity Commission’s proposal for legalising this theft is called “text and data mining” or TDM. Socialised early in the AI debate by a small group of tech lobbyists, the open secret about TDM is that even its proponents considered it was an absolute long shot and would not be taken seriously by Australian policymakers.Devised as a mechanism primarily to support research over large volumes of information, TDM is entirely ill-suited to the context of unlawful appropriation of copyright works for commercial AI development. Especially when it puts at risk the5.9% of Australia’s workforcein creative industries and, speaking of productivity, the$160bn national contributionthey generate. The net effect if adopted would be that the tech companies can continue to take our property without consent or payment, but additionally without the threat of legal action for breaking the law.Let’s look at just who the Productivity Commission would like to give this huge free-kick to.Big Tech’s first fortunes were made by stealing our personal information, click by click. Now our emails can be read, our conversations eavesdropped on, our whereabouts and spending patterns tracked, our attention frayed, our dopamine manipulated, our fears magnified, our children harmed, our hopes and dreams plundered and monetised.The values of the tech titans are not only undemocratic, they are inhumane. Mark Zuckerberg’s empathy atrophied as his algorithm expanded. He hassaid, “A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to you right now than people dying in Africa.” Henow openly advocates“a culture that celebrates aggression” and for even more “masculine energy” in the workplace. Eric Schmidt, former head of Google, has said, “We don’t need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you’ve been. We can more or less know what you’re thinking about.”The craven, toadying, data-thieving, unaccountable broligarchs we saw lined up on inauguration day in the US have laid claim to our personal information, which they use for profit, for power and for control. They have amply demonstrated that they do not have the flourishing of humans and their democracies at heart.Arts and media groups demand Labor take a stand against ‘rampant theft’ of Australian content to train AIRead moreAnd now, to make their second tranche of fortunes under the guise of AI, this sector has stolen our work.Our government should not legalise this outrageous theft. It would be the end of creative writing, journalism, long-form nonfiction and essays, music, screen and theatre writing in Australia. Why would you work if your work can be stolen, degraded, stripped of your association, and made instantly and universally available for free? It will be the end of Australian publishing, a $2bn industry. And it will be the end of us knowing ourselves by knowing our own stories.Copyright is in the sights of the technology firms because it squarely protects Australian creators and our national engine of cultural production, innovation and enterprise. We should not create tech-specific regulation to give it away to this industry – local or overseas – for free, and for no discernible benefit to the nation.The rub for the government is that much of the mistreatment of Australian creators involves acts outside Australia. But this is all the more reason to reinforce copyright protection at home. We aren’t satisfied with “what happens overseas stays overseas” in any other context – whether we’re talking about cars or pharmaceuticals or modern slavery. Nor should we be when it comes to copyright.Over the last quarter-century, tech firms have honed the art of win-win legal exceptionalism. Text and data mining is a win if it becomes law, but it’s a win even if it doesn’t – because the debate itself has very effectively diverted attention, lowered expectations, exhausted creators, drained already meagerly resourced representatives and, above all, delayed copyright enforcement in a case of flagrant abuse.So what should the government do? It should strategise, not surrender. It should insist that any AI product made available to Australian consumers demonstrate compliance with our copyright and moral rights regime. It should require the deletion of stolen work from AI offerings. And it should demand the negotiation of proper – not token or partial – consent and payment to creators. This is a battle for the mind and soul of our nation – let’s imagine and create a future worth having.Anna Funder is the author of the prize-winning international bestsellers Stasiland, All That I Am and Wifedom: Mrs Orwell’s Invisible Life.

If the goal is homogeneous whiteness, they should say itWed 10 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 10 Sep 2025 05.56 EDTShareDo they come for you at dawn or dusk? In the dead of night, or at family dinnertime? Will they come with masks and shields, or will they be kindly and sheepishly apologetic? Will they accept a cup of tea and a biscuit if offered? Will there be bags already packed by the door, protocols prepped and drilled, a list of numbers to call? Will you go quietly and with dignity, or in a mess of curse words and screaming limbs?Perhaps right now this all feels a little fantastical and far-fetched. Perhaps it feels hard to imagine the great wave of remigration lapping up on the pristine middle-class doorsteps of Stroud or Stoke Newington. We can still have a chuckle about it. Maybe there’ll be a nice fat relocation cheque. A free one-way holiday on the British government. Always wanted to visit China at this time of year, and so on.But of course if the recent history of British politics has taught us anything, it is that nightmarish visions do not stay nightmarish visions for long. There is a heft and momentum behind them, a spirited and concerted effort to make the nightmare flesh. And so in our darkest daydreams, many of the non-white citizens of this country occasionally entertain an idle thought exercise: who wants to get rid of us? Is it you, grumbling old lady on the bus? Is it you, the smartly dressed businessman tutting quietly as two beaming mixed-race children whiz by on mini-scooters? Was that an innocent jostle in the pub queue, or the unmistakable microaggression of a seething racist who wants me gone for good?Two decades after the Conservative party asked “Are you thinking what we’re thinking?”, it turns out that quite a lot of people were. Through the long years of Windrush scandals and asylum panic, Brexit and beyond, from the British National party in local government to white nationalists proudly parading through our streets, from the Rwanda scheme to“great replacement” theory, a menacing anti-migrant movement has been growling into gear. And we should probably be clear at this point that hotels and small boats were never the endgame.Of course we knew right from the start that “legitimate concerns over immigration” always had a kernel of racial purification at their core. The tropes and elisions of rightwing discourse – “traditional British values”, “Londonistan”, “multiculturalism” – were always mere euphemisms for simpler and more sinister desires. What has been left unsaid, until relatively recently, has been the other half of the equation: how these desires were going to be sated. The roundups and deportations, families being handcuffed and strapped into planes, the wartime-style powers that would create a permanently hostile environment for anyone deemed insufficiently native. This is the omertà that is gradually dissolving.View image in fullscreenFlags on Westminster Bridge in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, 28 August 2025.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesNaturally, Nigel Farage knew what he was doing when he appeared toexclude women and children from his planto deport 600,000 people in the first term of a Reform government. He is a savvy enough operator to know that there is not yet a political consensus around the mass deportation of families, much less established citizens. But he was careful not to rule it out entirely. “At this stage it’s not part of our plan for the next five years,” he said, leaving himself plenty of room for constructive ambiguity. Recall that as recently as last September Farage was rejecting mass deportations as “a political impossibility”, and it becomes clear that his intention is to shift the window of the acceptable firmly but by small degrees. And in the meantime, there are plenty of loud voices happy to make the case in his absence.You do not even need to wade into the swamp waters of X and Facebook, where “remigration” discourse has spiralled into a kind of mass frenzy, where non-white Britons are routinely hounded with cries of “deport”. The MP Rupert Lowe has published his blueprint for the “mass deportation of illegal migrants”, and of course once you have the levers of power the words “illegal” and “migrant” can mean whatever you want them to mean. “From Epping to the sea, let’s make England Abdul free,” proclaimed the former Conservative and Ukip MP Douglas Carswell said last week. James Catton, the donor manager of Reform UK, has advocated forciblydeporting 10 million people.The paradox here is that these are extreme fringe viewpoints, advocated by a tiny sliver of the British population, and yet with the potential to exert a frighteningly disproportionate influence on a future political class. The mobbed state violence of the Trump administration offers a blueprint for how a broad-based electoral mandate can be leveraged to advance sweeping minoritarian policies, a racist purge enacted under the pretences of popular consent. The burning question, as such, is not how this future can be realised, but who is going to avert it.So it starts with refugees and sex offenders, the publicly palatable victims of state retribution. Where does it go next? Perhapsrecent legal migrants, as advocated by a Times columnist on Monday. Naturally, human rights law will need to be dismantled in its entirety, allowing the Home Office to be retooled as a weapon of remigration, citizenship to be reimagined as a function of whiteness, entire communities criminalised at the stroke of a pen, a state of perpetual emergency enacted.There will be mistakes and administrative errors that will in reality not be errors but intentional bugs, poison pills in an apparatus of mass fear. A permanently hostile environment, in which the guy who defaces a mosque or racially abuses me in the street knows he will get away with it. We will hear talk of population control and enemies within. Finally, once a few turbulent years have elapsed, once the window has shifted far enough, the knock on the door. At which point, does the rightwing press finally locate its moral compass and scream: no more?Does this still look like dystopian fiction to you? Perhaps a better way of framing the question is to go back two decades, pretend that the ethnic cleansing of the United Kingdom was your ultimate goal, and ask how satisfied you would be with how things had turned out. The nativist fantasies of yesterday are now written into the manifestos of today, and who knows how the manifestos of tomorrow will read. The leader of the Alternative für Deutschland, leading many opinion polls in Germany, has endorsed the mass remigration of migrant communities. The far-right Vox party in Spain has vowed todeport 8 million “foreigners”and has polled as high as 18.9% this year. The project of sealing national borders has, ironically, been a concerted cross-border effort.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most of us have no coherent, overarching vision for how the world should work, much less how we should get there. What we so often describe as politics is, in fact, a series of shoves: splenetic, emotional and with a wilful blindness to consequence that can so easily be exploited by those with a clear destination in mind.And so the politicians and pundits who now crack the whip on immigration need to be asked, right now, where this ends. They should be made to say the thing they are judiciously trying to avoid saying, or to renounce it completely. Bottom line: the idea of mass deportations as a realistic political agenda would have felt as far-fetched two decades ago as the idea of your non-white friends being strapped into a plane does now. This, in itself, should serve as a warning.Jonathan Liew is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is exhaustingZoya PatelIt feels like no matter how long we’ve been here, we’re just not enoughGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastTue 9 Sep 2025 20.02 EDTLast modified on Tue 9 Sep 2025 23.09 EDTShareBeing an Indian immigrant in Australia is exhausting. The irony that many of us are here because our parents, or their parents, chose this country in their quest for a “better life”, after our own country was decimated by British colonialism, is not lost on me.My own ancestors were shipped from India by the British to Fiji to work as indentured labourers – ostensibly slaves – on Australian-operated sugar farms in the late 1800s. Multiple generations later, after enduring political and social exclusion in Fiji and being subject to racist rhetoric and political violence, my parents worked insanely hard to find a pathway to Australia, so that their children could escape the cycles of poverty and entrenched disadvantage that they lived through.So to wind up here, in 2025, once again the target of racism, stigma and prejudice from our communities and our political leaders is not just disappointing, it’s so tiring that I almost didn’t want to write about it. When will it end? What’s the point in, once again, pointing out how absurdly unfair this racism is, when that never seems to stop it from recurring?The division exposed by the March for Australia was a test for our politicians. They failed it – and put the nation last | Zoe DanielRead moreOver the past few months, I’ve watched my social media feeds gradually swell with videos of young, white Australians espousing their anger at being “swamped” by Indians, as though the people they’re referencing aren’t the same kids they went to school with, who grew up alongside them, as Australian as their own undoubtedly immigrant ancestors.It’s one thing to see these videos and feel perplexed over how this generation is somehow imbibing the same anti-Indian/Asian immigration rhetoric that we grew up dealing with in the 1990s. It was another thing to watch violent protests take over the country specifically calling for people like us to be torn out of the fabric of this society.But to have someone likeJacinta Nampijinpa Pricepiggy back off this surge of racism to take a cheap shot at the Labor party felt like salt in the wound. That a political leader would validate this sentiment, which is so clearly mired in hatred and has very little to do with genuinely calling for solutions to the cost of living and housing crises, was a signal to people like me that we aren’t considered Australian. It doesn’t matter how long we’ve been here – we’re just not enough.When I was younger, my immediate reaction to racism was to try and point out that – despite being brown – I was just like the white people in Australia. I grew up here! I don’t know any other home! “I’m one of you,” I tried to convey.3:33Factchecking protesters' claims of 'mass migration' into Australia – videoNow, I realise that this argument plays into the same territory of the racists – because even if I was a recent immigrant, even if my English wasn’t perfect or spoken with an Australian accent, even if a large part of my life happened in a different country, I would still hold the same value as anyone else here, and have the same right to contribute to this country and benefit from it.I have a son, and recently I was thinking about how when I was just a little older than him, my preschool in country New South Wales told my parents that they should take me out of classes, because I was being routinely bullied by the other children. I remember it. I was told I was “brown like poo” and excluded from play time, and the staff’s response was to remove me from the environment because they didn’t know how else to deal with it.Reflecting on this, I found myself feeling glad that my child’s mixed race heritage means he is white passing, and hopefully won’t have to face any similar discrimination himself. He’s less than two years old. These are the things that play on my mind, after a lifetime in Australia.I used to try to justify my existence here, to explain why racist attitudes are wrong using logic and reason. Now, I have only anger left. I am furious that this is a conversation that is being allowed to play out on a national stage. I am furious that hundreds of thousands of hardworking Australian immigrants are being forced to justify our existence in this country that relies on our labour and skills to service its economy. I am furious that some ignorant people are using my community as the targets for their hatred and prejudice, and their desire for a moment in the spotlight.The only thing I take solace in is that by continuing to succeed, prosper and grow a family in this country, I am exacting my best revenge on the racists. After all, a happy, successful, tax-paying Australian Indian is apparently their worst nightmare.Zoya Patel is a writer and editor based in CanberraExplore more on these topicsAustralian politicsOpinionAustralian immigration and asylumcommentShareReuse this content"

But at the film’s premiere in London earlier this month, that movie’s star, Hugh Bonneville, spoke out aboutGaza. “Before I talk about the fluff and loveliness of our wonderful film, what’s about to happen in Gaza City is absolutely indefensible,” he announced to a visibly shocked showbiz reporter. “The international community must do more to bring it to an end.”Bonneville’s words may have been surprising for some, but they’re actually part of a larger pattern of actors, musicians, artists and cultural figures who feel increasingly moved to speak out. This week hundreds of actors – including Olivia Colman, Aimee Lou Wood and Mark Ruffalo –signed a pledge promising not to work with Israeli film institutionsthey say are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people”. From the Eurovision winner JJ using his victory to criticise Israel to footballer Mohamed Salah lambasting UEFA for announcing the death of Suleiman Obeid, the “Palestinian Pele”, without saying that he was killed in an Israeli attack, there is a sense that if people don’t use their platforms to speak out now, they may bitterly regret it later.There’s been a shift – artists see their platforms matter and want to amplify the call for justice“So many people have been afraid of saying the wrong thing, but are now realising that silence is also a statement,” says the musician PinkPantheress, who thinks we are at a tipping point in terms of discussingGaza. “There’s been this shift where artists see that their platforms actually matter – and that it is their responsibility to amplify the call for justice. Neutrality shouldn’t be an option.”Next week, PinkPantheress will be performing in a manifestation of this tipping point, when a concert called Together for Palestine is held at the 12,500-capacity Wembley Arena, with all profits going to Palestinian humanitarian groups in Gaza through British charityChoose Love. It will be one of the largest-scale benefit concerts for Palestine, since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023. These were followed by a campaign ofbombardmentandstarvation by Israelthat has been labelled a genocide by groups including theUNand Amnesty International.Along with names who have spoken out about Palestine for years, such as Massive Attack and Damon Albarn, there is a broad range of cultural figures on the bill including Benedict Cumberbatch, Louis Theroux, Bastille, Paloma Faith, Riz Ahmed, Amelia Dimoldenberg, Hot Chip, Guy Pearce, Portishead, Celeste and Jamie xx. Palestinian artists and musicians, such as Faraj Suleiman, Malak Mattar and Nai Barghouti, are also represented.View image in fullscreenSigned a boycott pledge … Olivia Colman.Photograph: Cat Morley/AvalonThe concert, which sold out in a few hours, has taken 18 months to organise. Venues were initially highly reluctant to be involved, while some musicians showed hesitation about signing up – the fact it is happening at all points not just to the increasingly urgent situation in Gaza, but the way fears about speaking out are starting to dissipate.“You don’t want to be the only person doing this,” saysBrian Eno, who is organising the concert with film producer Tracey Seaward, who was behind Dirty Pretty Things and The Queen, actor Khalid Abdalla, who starred in United 93 and The Kite Runner, and founder of the London Palestine Film Festival Khaled Ziada. “When we first started out,” says Eno, “it was hard to get anyone interested. But I think everyone’s realised that what’s happening in Gaza is completely obscene. Whatever conflicted feelings they might have had about the war beforehand have suddenly disappeared. It’s immoral and repulsive. I think on that point, everybody can at least agree.”Eno is keen to stress that Together for Palestine is not a political rally. Rather, it is billed as a day of hope, community and remembrance. “A lot of the people involved in making this show are Jewish, along with a lot of Palestinians as well,” says Eno. “We want it to be seen as an occasion in which people work together, regardless of their particular faith or ethnic affiliation.”One of those Palestinians is the artist Malak Mattar, who has been working with renowned stage designer Es Devlin to curate a selection of Palestinian artworks for the show. Some of these will be by artists who have died during the conflict, such as Heba Zaqout, who was killed by an Israeli airstrike in October 2023, and Duniyana Al-Amour, who waskilled in her bedroom at the age of 22. The latter attack by Israel took place in August 2022, a reminder that such strikes were taking place long before the Hamas atrocities happened.View image in fullscreen‘When the call came, it was impossible to say no’ … PinkPantheress.Photograph: Scott A Garfitt/Invision/APAs someone who grew up in Gaza and still has family members there, it can be frustrating, says Mattar, to witness the silence of many fellow artists and institutions in the UK. “As an artist myself,” she says, “I know what it means to have things cancelled because you’ve spoken out. I have been asked not to make speeches at my exhibitions. But I think right now is a powerful moment of history, where people are coming together to speak out. It’s going to be a great sense of solidarity that we feel on the night of 17 September – and also very moving when we remember the people that we lost during the genocide.”When the concert was first announced, Eno admitted that one of his biggest regrets, over his illustrious five-decade career in the music industry, was that “so many of us have remained silent about Palestine. Often that silence has come from fear – real fear – that speaking out could provoke a backlash, close doors or end a career.”Yet this fear is now being discussed much more openly. Kneecap were subject to a police investigation and faced calls to have their US work visas revoked after accusing Israel of genocide onstage at the Coachella festival in April. This hasn’t prevented the likes of PinkPantheress from getting involved in the concert: “My team and I talk about the genocide in Palestine often, and what we can do to help as individuals, as a collective, but also what I can do as an artist. Putting your ego aside is important. You have to be willing to learn and get things wrong every now and again. I’m constantly listening and engaging in conversations with my team and friends. When the call came to appear at Together for Palestine, it was impossible to say no.”View image in fullscreenOn the bill … Jamie xx.Photograph: Steve Jennings/Getty ImagesBeing open to learning about the reality of the situation seems crucial for the shift that is now happening. Eno happily admits that his own views on Gaza changed after visiting the West Bank six years ago. There he saw firsthand what he calls “the relentless humiliation … which is the nastiest weapon in a way … continually demeaning, continually shilly-shallying, pretending there’s a peace process when there’s no intention whatsoever to achieve peace on any kind of terms that the Palestinians could possibly accept.”When he tried to explain this to people, Eno says, he was always being forced to go through the entire history of the conflict. People were either bamboozled by the conflicting accounts, or looking for an easy way to avoid getting involved. “Israel has always, in my opinion, depended on calling on the complexity of the situation,” says Eno. “To sort of say, ‘Well, of course you don’t really understand it, it’s far more complex than you can imagine.’ But people are no longer asking me to do this, because everyone knows we shouldn’t be in the place we are now.”PinkPantheress says that having so many fellow artists on the bill supporting the message has made it easier to speak out – and hopefully will make it easier for others to join them in future. “One voice can get ignored,” she says, “but when it’s a chorus it’s way harder. Seeing artists from totally different backgrounds come together proves this isn’t just a political issue but a human one.”Together for Palestine is atWembley Arena, London, 17 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsMusicBrian EnoFestivalsGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Amber’s aim was to capture working-class life in north-east England, and over nearly 30 years I amassed a body of work documenting life in the upper Durham Dales – a project I later called People of the Hills. In 1994, I moved with my young family into a derelict plumber’s workshop and yard in Stanhope, Weardale. Living there over the next six years meant I met people in all kinds of circumstances – I got to know and photograph many local owners of smallholdings because my kids befriended theirs at school.The members of the Stanhope Silver Band, seen in this photograph, were well known in the village. One was a joiner who paid us five quid a month to use our outbuildings as workshop space. I don’t know how many of those in the picture are still in the band – a fair few, I’ll bet.Every second weekend in September, there’s an agricultural show in Stanhope which takes place on the south side of the River Wear – the village is largely on the north side. The band always meet in the village marketplace and then walk to the show via Stanhope Ford, where they cross the river over a series of stepping stones.It was the early days of my colour photography career and the band all wore bright red jumpersIn 1996 I was still in the early days of my colour photography career. The band all wore bright red jumpers, and the river could turn bluer on a sunny day. In September, there’s still plenty of foliage in Weardale too, so it seemed a good opportunity to get something that would use the colour medium to its fullest.I realised it could be an interesting shot for me, because I’m usually up close to people. I have a background in sociology, so there was always an element of “participant observation” in my work. The Silver Band image was a rare example of being able to concentrate on every small detail. This was truly a visual play, unfolding before me on an open air stage.The stepping stones were always a fun challenge with my kids and their friends. You can see on the picture that there’s only room for one person on each stone, and at least a foot between them. When you’ve got more than 20 members of a band, it’s a very delicate operation to get across. It’s a bit like ducklings following their mother.By the time I took this, I’d photographed the band in other situations and when they saw me standing in the middle of the river, I think they just thought: “Here he goes again.” I’d visited the spot a day or two before to find the best place to stand – there were some spots where the river was maybe a foot deep but others where the water would definitely have gone over the top of my welly boots. I was looking west and it was morning, so the stones were nicely lit.You can look at each individual and see whether they’re looking back, looking forward, waiting or stretching across to the next stone. So the picture also has a kind of celebratory feel, which was always a part of Amber’s philosophy – to celebrate working-class culture.Richard Grassick’s Stanhope Silver Band is available inSide’s 50x50 charity print sale.

But sometimes, things get far, far more brutalStuart HeritageWed 10 Sep 2025 11.08 EDTShareIt shouldn’t really be a surprise that South Park has become“the most important TV show of the Trump 2.0 era”. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have spent decades taking any potshot they like at whoever they choose, from Saddam Hussein to Guitar Hero to – thanks to their inexplicable 2001 live-action sitcomThat’s My Bush!– other sitting presidents.But by using every episode in its latest series to focus their fury solely at the current US administration, hitting Trump with a combination of policy rebuttals and dick jokes (and daring him to sue them in the process), this is the strongest sense yet that Parker and Stone are out for nothing less than full regime change.Let’s not pretend that South Park is the first cartoon to attempt this, though. For almost a century, animation has often proved to be a better satirical weapon than anything made with flesh-and-blood actors. There is a sense that, to some, George HW Bush will be remembered by the mauling he received at the hands of The Simpsons,which depicted him as a gullible, uptight neighbourafter he dared to criticise the show during a speech on family values. You could argue that the show pulled its punches a little – his episode, Two Bad Neighbors, didn’t air until he had been out of office for three years – but the anger is still palpable.View image in fullscreenNo double entendre … Donald Trump in Sermon on the Mount, episode one of season 27 of South Park.Illustration: South Park StudiosSimilarly, even though Seth MacFarlane’s American Dad has been going for so long (388 episodes and counting) and its satire has long since softened into screwball sitcommery, it’s important to remember that his series came to fruition as a response to the George W Bush administration in the wake of 9/11. The protagonist is a patriotic Republican CIA agent hellbent on enforcing homeland security no matter what. In season three, he performed aSchoolhouse Rock-style songaboutthe Iran-Contra scandalthat may well qualify as the best entry-level explainer of the subject ever made.The fact that these worked where That’s My Bush! failed might be down to the fact that they are animated. “I think there’s a spectrum,” says Dr Adam Smith of York University’s Research Unit for the Study of Satire. “On one end, you’ve got film, where you’re seeing an actual representation of the thing you’re satirising. And on the other end of the spectrum, there are things like abstract poetry, where the viewer has to work harder to figure out what the thing means. Visual comedy, like cartoons and caricatures, is on the direct end of the spectrum, so you get the message in a split second.”View image in fullscreenBorn in the USA … the cast of American Dad.Photograph: Everett Collection /AlamyThis is partly whySouth Parkis succeeding in tackling Trump; while drama and journalism might grapple with the totality of Trump’s instincts and temperament, South Park can depict him as a horny psychopath with a tiny penis, and it lands all the harder.The approach is in huge contrast to their depiction of Trump during his last term. Back then, the show largely avoided him, instead drawing in the elementary school character Mr Garrison as a Trump character. As Dr Smith explains, that was a far more traditional way of tackling a government.“A lot of satire as we understand it today relies on allegory or double entendre,” says Smith. “This evolved in the 18th century in response to libel laws. It’s a way to critique the thing without being prosecuted for the thing.”But this time around, South Park is going in two-footed. This season’s Trump isDonald Trump, animated with a photo of his face. This doesn’t leave much room for allegory.“What they’re doing now is the opposite of how satire normally works,” Smith continues. “It’s almost like they’re trying to get prosecuted, isn’t it? The satirical act of this new series is the baiting of Donald Trump. If they can get the president of the free world to try to sue them, it reveals that he’s not got a good sense of humour. It reveals he’s petty. It reveals that he’s ridiculous. So the critique will actually be in the way he responds.”View image in fullscreen‘When it went out on BBC Three, the commissioner hated it’ … Comedian Imran Yusuf’s animated sitcom Union Jack.Photograph: Imran YusufOf course, these are very American examples of satire, bright and funny and direct. It’s telling that British efforts to mimic this approach tend to be rooted less in longform series and more in sketch. Spitting Image is the prime example here, which was able to crystallise the perception of several leading politicians for 12 years in the 80s and 90s. But even this has cooled of late. BritBox’s Spitting Image revival died on impact in 2020, and other attempts at animated sketch satire (like 2DTV and Headcases) similarly failed.The comedian and philosopher Imran Yusuf attempted a version of this with his 2014 animationUnion Jack, about a British man who – proving some subjects never fully go away – is aggressively suspicious of his non-white neighbours. “We wrote a couple of scripts and tried to pitch it, but everyone turned it away. When it went out on BBC Three, the commissioner hated it,” says Yusuf. “Britain is terrified of doing what the Americans do in regards to political satire and animation. Why don’t we have The Simpsons and Family Guy and American Dad and South Park? Part of the problem is, and this is where it gets really hairy, if a black or a brown writer writes political satire that satirises white politics and white culture, there’s going to be less commissioning will to make it happen.”View image in fullscreenBanned … Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyStill, it could be worse. Elsewhere in the world, where authoritarian regimes tend not to enjoy direct insults, animators have long since used other methods to get their point across. For example,Marjane Satrapi’s film Persepolis, about a young girl struggling to come of age against the backdrop of the Iranian Revolution – which it depicts unflatteringly – could only have been made outside Iran. Indeed, upon release it faced bans in Iran and Lebanon, and in recent years schools in some American states have attempted to ban Satrapi’s original graphic novel from schools.Elsewhere, artists have had to use metaphor and symbolism to slip the net. During its time spent under military dictatorship from the 60s to the 80s, Brazil’s government suppressed political art, so artists were forced to obfuscate their point. This resulted in work likeVendo OuvindobyLula Gonzaga. On the surface, the film is simply a rudimentary cutout of a face. However, as soon as you key into the context in which it was made, you realise that the face can see and hear but not speak. In other words, it’s a reflection of life under authoritarian censorship.But sometimes even this doesn’t work.Dimensions of Dialogue, a short film by the Czech film-maker Jan Švankmajer, was an abstract depiction of, among other things, one clay head sharpening its tongue on another clay head. Despite containing no specific message, it was made in explicit defiance of the Czechoslovak Communist party’s preference for social realism in animation. And it worked; the party not only banned it, but used it as an example of the sort of thing it wouldn’t stand for.View image in fullscreenAbstract … Czech film-maker Jan Švankmajer’s Dimensions of Dialogue.Photograph: Kratky Film/RGR Collection/Mary Evans/AlamyTellingly, the White House reaction to South Park has been the exact opposite: JD Vance and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement chose to tweet about their depiction rather than try to erase it from existence.But, as Dr Smith says, the fact that the administration is attempting to laugh along with it doesn’t mean that the satire has failed. “I suppose it depends on what the point of satire is,” he says. “You always get these questions like, does it change anything? I think it’s too soon to say. My preferred explanation when people ask about the value of satire is that, if you engage in enough satire, it makes you incredulous. Perhaps the ultimate goal of South Park is not how JD Vance or Ice reacts, but the people who have watched it and thought about it. Are they going to be more critical in their day-to-day lives as a result?”With this in mind, something like South Park, which has the ability to go after Donald Trump so aggressively that nobody can misunderstand its point of view, is something of an outlier. But if America does slip into full-blown dictatorship, as with Brazil and the Eastern Bloc before it, this might all change. In other words, if you like your animation satirical, now might be the time to get into abstract clay heads.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionSouth ParkAnimation on TVUS politicsDonald TrumpCensorshipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The conductor Franz Welser-Möst barely needed to break a sweat to draw out impeccably polished string sound and top-notch wind and brass solos. No surprises there. But might a few surprises, a few experiments, have made it more memorable?For all the pleasures of these performances, the cumulative effect was of safety and good taste – words not usually applied to Berg’s Lulu Suite, three movements of which began the first concert. The strings and flute sent their tendrils out tenderly and silkily; the blend when the rest joined in was seamless. The intrusion of low brass near the end of the first movement and a moment of barrel-organ brightness in the second briefly ruffled the surface, but you wouldn’t have guessed the anguish of the Lulu story from this.Nor was the finale of Tchaikovsky’s Sixth Symphony the following night as darkly devastating a conclusion as it can be, although the closing bars, the melodic lines sobbing repeatedly over insistently pulsing double basses, did finally pack an emotional punch. This followed a smart, tautly controlled March and a second-movement dance as light-footed as you’d expect from an orchestra with the VPO’s waltz pedigree.Opening the second concert, Welser-Möst made no great statements with his poised, patrician interpretation of Mozart’s Prague Symphony: Mozart’s symphonies almost have novelty value now outside period-instrument orchestras, and performances as straightforward as this perhaps even more so. Tempos were flowing but unhurried, the sonorities in perfect balance, and the wind provided small but noticeable dabs of colour in the finale, without especially standing out.If there was some truly memorable playing it came with another Austrian symphony, Bruckner’s Ninth, which followed the Berg in the first concert. The orchestra immediately found a golden sound that could encompass the length and breadth of Bruckner’s endless phrases in these three movements – the symphony was performed incomplete, as Bruckner left it. Within this sound quality there was still room for quicksilver changes of tone: the end of the first movement, simultaneously jubilant and ominous, set us up for the menacingly mechanical qualities of the second – which temporarily evaporated into skittish violins and chirrupping flute.What was most striking, though, was the all-persuasive sense of direction, stemming partly from Welser-Möst’s notably fluent tempos but also from the quality of the phrasing: the cogs of Bruckner’s music, those endlessly repeated cells and ideas, needed no extra effort to keep turning. Sometimes it feels as though Bruckner only ever wrote slow music, but here the music emerged with a flow as natural as breathing.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

It was finally released last Thursday after many years in development, and everybody is loving it. Hollow Knight was so popular that itcrashed multiple gaming storefronts. With continual game cancellations, expensive failures and layoffs at bigger studios, this is the kind of indie triumph the industry loves to celebrate at the moment. But Silksong hasn’t come out of nowhere, and its success would not be easily reproducible for any other game, indie or not.If you’re wondering what this game actuallyis, then imagine a dark, mostly underground labyrinth of bug nests and abandoned caverns that gradually yields its secrets to a determined player. The art style and sound are minimalist and creepy (though not scary) in a Tim Burton kind of way, the enemy bugs are fierce and hard to defeat, your player character is another bug with a small, sharp needle-like blade. It blends elements of Metroid, Dark Souls and older challenging platform games, and the unique aesthetic andperfectprecision of the controls are what make it stand out from a swarm of similar games. I rinsed the first Hollow Knight and I’m captivated by Silksong. I’ve spent 15 hours on it in three days, and it has made my thumbs hurt.The first Hollow Knight, released in 2017, was a slow-burn surprise hit. It was crowdfunded via Kickstarter in 2014, and Silksong was one of its stretch goals: originally it was supposed to be an expansion for the game, but as the studio’s co-founders, Ari Gibson and William Pellen, told Bloomberg in a recent interview, they were simply having too much fun to stop adding to it. Eventually, over seven years, it became the full-blown 20-plus-hour game that everyone is now enjoying.How could a small team afford to spend all this time on a single game? Well: the first Hollow Knight sold 15m copies. Any developer would dream of working with the resultant resources. Good games do take a long time to make, even when there’s no mismanagement or other development drama getting in the way. Most smaller-scale game developers are constantly seeking funding from investors or publishers who then (understandably) impose timescales far less generous than what Team Cherry has been working with.View image in fullscreenKnight’s tale … Hollow Knight: SilksongPhotograph: Team CherryThe other unique thing about Silksong is the way in which hype has built to a fever pitch over the last several years. The game became so mysterious that it turned into a meme: people have been spamming the chat and the comments of every single game showcase or news event with the words “Where’s Silksong?” for years. Presumably millions of people who never played the first Hollow Knight have been exposed to it in this way. I’ve never seen another indie game achieve this level of notoriety before it was even released. Such was Silksong’s legend that when its release date was announced a few weeks ago several other games were sent scurrying from its wake, delayed by their developers to avoid getting lost in the noise. Pity those games thatweren’tdelayed: asVGC points out, Atari released a similar game on the same day as Silksong (Adventure of Samsara) and it had only 12 concurrent players on Steam.As proven years ago byDuke Nukem Forever, no amount of free publicity could have saved Silksong if it had turned out to be rubbish. Thankfully, it’s excellent. It’s the kind of game whose appeal perhaps isn’t immediately evident; my partner, watching me spend a full hour trying to bounce my character off a series of punishingly placed balloons to ascend a horrible gauntlet of flying things, looked mildly concerned for my wellbeing. (Something in me just won’t let me quit when I come up against sadistically challenging games.) But as millions of players are now simultaneously discovering, it’s exactly the repeated failures that makes the rush of success so invigorating.One more thing about Silksong: spare a thought for the people who, in these moments where it feels like the whole world has been swept up by a game, simply do not enjoy it. Our games correspondent Keith Stuart is one of those unfortunates. “It is rare for me to be completely bewildered by a game’s success, and I know I’m in a tiny minority here, but I don’t get Hollow Knight or Silksong,” he says. “To me, they’re serviceable Metroidvania platformers with a very familiar alien organic aesthetic and tough boss battles. However, the games lack the glitchy, idiosyncratic charm of, say Cave Story or Animal Well, and the luscious visual confidence of, well, Castlevania or Super Metroid. I played Silksong for several hours over the weekend and, although it’s fine – it’sgood– I still felt as if I was being gaslit by the entire industry.”What to playView image in fullscreenCatch ’em all … Pokémon Legends Arceus.Photograph: NintendoGiven that every other game has run screaming from Silksong, there’s not much else to recommend this week – so I’m here with a belated recommendation forPokémon Legends Arceus, a game I slept on when it was released in 2022. This is largely because it was really ropey then, chugging along as you ran around its open fields searching for creatures; its rubbish performance undermined the freedom and possibility the designers clearly intended. But it runs so much better on the Switch 2.Casting you as a Pokémon field researcher rather than a trainer, it has you exploring whole regions full of free-roaming Pokémon, sneaking up on them to throw Pokéballs or hiding in long grass to avoid doing battle with intimidating alpha creatures. The semi-historical setting is a welcome novelty, too – you’re thrown back in time to an Edo-esque period where humans and Pokémon are just learning how they might live together. I have been playing this every evening with my sons, both of them excitedly leafing through their Pokémon encyclopedia books every time we spot a new creature. It satisfies my ageing-millennial draw towards bird-watching and my inner child’s enduring love for Pokémon.Available on:Nintendo Switch/Switch 2Estimated playtime:30-plus hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenThe name’s … 007 First Light.Photograph: IO InteractiveThe first gameplay footage of Hitman developer IO Interactive’s Bond game,007 First Light, debuted last week. There’sa whole half-hour of action, spycraft and (naturally) driving, and it’s looking great. Admittedly, my only connection to Bond is GoldenEye on the N64, but I am intrigued to play a Bond game that has you mingling at parties and digging for information as well as shooting at bad guys and getting into car chases.Earlier this year, an electronics reseller came into possession of atrove of development consoles and cartridgesfrom Sega’s old Basingstoke offices, bought as part of a clearance. In July, he was raided by police,reports Time Extension. The seller was arrested and the collection of prototype games and consoles were seized. This has sparked a fascinating series of events, as the legal ownership of these pieces of gaming history remains unclear; the electronics reseller, who says he has received no clarification from Sega or the police, suspects that they may already have been destroyed.Take-Two was in talks to rescue the recently cancelled Xbox reboot of spy gamePerfect Dark,reports Bloomberg– but unfortunately Microsoft still cancelled the project and its developer, the Initiative, has been shuttered. Co-developer Crystal Dynamics also had layoffs. Crystal Dynamics has had some terrible luck. After two good Tomb Raider games in 2013 and 2015, it released a middling third one (Shadow of the Tomb Raider) in 2018 and an Avengers game that famously underperformed in 2020. It was then sold to the notorious Embracer Group in 2022, and has struggled to get an original game over the line ever since.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One of those people was readerCordelia, who asks:“How do you feel about using walkthroughs and hints when a game becomes a bit sticky? I’ll be honest, I feel a bit guilty about it.”This is an apt question for this week’s edition becauseHollow Knight: Silksongis really,reallyhard, and giving in and looking up a map or Googling for an answer could be the difference between persevering and giving up on the game. I’m used to playing games without any help: because I’m often playing games for review, thereareno walkthroughs. But I am most certainly not above reading a walkthrough, and I especially appreciate the guide writers out there who’ll give you a nudge in the right direction before just straight-up showing you the answer.Many modern games are communal and collaborative, and sharing experiences and hints is a natural part of that; few people could get through something likeDark Soulsalone, and indeed the game is designed to facilitate cooperation, because it takes the edge off what would otherwise be extreme difficulty. I often look up walkthroughs and guides after I’m done playing a game, too, to see what I might have missed, or whether there’s some secret ending; I didn’t touch a guide while I was playingBlue Princebecause I knew it would spoil my fun, but the second I got to the end I was boning up on all the extra puzzles and content that I definitely wasn’t going to have time to experience.I also look up guides when a game is scary: I’m not ashamed to admit that I played the firstLast of Uswith a text walkthrough so that I knew when fungal zombies were going to jump out at me, and when I could relax. And I also used to rely on guides back when I was a teenager, when I’d import games from Japan but couldn’t read what the hell I was supposed to be doing. Bless the tireless efforts of the GameFAQs authors of the past, who got me through several Japanese PS2 RPGs.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterAction gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nobody can occupy dreams. Nobody can occupy ideas. Nobody can occupy memory … Nobody can occupy your imagination,” said Masharawi in an interview in London ahead of the film’s release in UK cinemas on 12 September.“We have to be optimistic. We have to tell the people: ‘Tomorrow it’s a better day. Keep dancing, keep creating, keep making films, because it means you have the future.’”View image in fullscreenFilm-maker Rashid Masharawi at the Étonnants Voyageurs festival in Saint-Malo, France, in June.Photograph: Sophie Bassouls/Sygma/Getty ImagesIn a poignant start, we see in Selfie by Reema Mahmoud a woman compose a letter to an unknown friend that by the end is a message in a bottle cast into the sea. In Soft Skin, Khamis Masharawi captures young children learning stop animation to convey the horrors of parents inscribing their limbs with their names should a bomb hit.But there are moments of dark humour too in Hell’s Heaven as the narrator wakes up in a body bag. Only one film, Taxi Wanissa, is left incomplete as director Etimad Washah appears with a testimony partway through: with the death of her brother and his children, she could not continue.In the anthology – which was Palestine’s official entry to the 2025Academy Awards– we see as people forge ahead despite being beset with new, unimaginable realities. And yet with the persistent buzzing of drones overhead, people continue to dance. In a sky that often rains bombardments and less often aid, children still fly kites. The weight of books left behind is measured against that of grief, and the sea is described to us as the only horizon. Drum sets are made from empty food tins, tea is shared, songs are still sung.The films are noticeably devoid of the images of violence and maimed bodies that have poured out of Gaza for nearly two years – which made it “possible for people to watch and deal with” these films, added Masharawi.View image in fullscreenOfferings, one of the shorts in From Ground Zero.Filming months after7 Octoberand into 2024, film-makers became both the storytellers and the story. Thoughts of cinema were difficult to prioritise when refuge, food, loss and trauma took precedence under bombardment. When electricity was cut in the enclave it was impossible to charge equipment, and at times days passed with no communication.The processwas difficult, admitted Masharawi, not just as a Palestinian born in the al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza, but as a human being. It means having to face all that Israel is doing, he said, and with members of his own family killed and homes destroyed, it’s very difficult, he added, to always share personal stories.“I believe in the power of the cinema, the image, the culture, the documentation,” said Masharawi resolutely. “It’s very important because people get used to, with time, slowly, the images they are watching on televisions. It’s the same. They see explosions, they see ambulances, they see martyrs.“This reminds them who they are, these people you are discussing. It’s very important,” he added.If the film serves to remind us of the lives behind the more than 64,000 killed in Gaza, it also reminds us of the attempts made to silence Palestinian voices.In July,Palestinian activist Awdah Hathaleenwas killed by an extremist Jewish settler in the West Bank after working on the filming of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land. The industry itself has seen a shift over time – “very late”, adds Masharawi – as a growing chorus of film professionals callsfor boycottsand signs open letters condemning the worsening humanitarian crisis.From Ground Zero: Stories From Gaza review – scenes of ordinary life in extremisRead more“Some things,” said Masharawi, “if it comes late, it’s better than if they did not come at all.”But the tide of public opinion has held little sway over Masharawi, who since becoming the first Palestinian to show a feature at Cannes with Haifa in 1996, returned to Cannes in 2024 in protest. After organisers expressed their desire to keep politics out of the event, Masharawi staged tents like those in Gaza and screened From Ground Zero.“It’s very important,” he tells me, “to make the films for life, for tomorrow – to make it with hope.”Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Still friends, the band explain their odd rebirthWed 10 Sep 2025 09.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 10 Sep 2025 09.21 EDTShareLike an outsider art version of Sugababes, or kids singing over Depeche Mode ringtones, there’s something both familiar and odd aboutSummer 2000by X-Cetra. Recorded by four preteens in Y2K California, the album distils sleepovers, crushes and butterfly clips into 11 tracks of bedroom pop and Windows 95 R&B, equal parts carefree and gravely serious.Only 20 CD-R copies were ever made. But a still-unknown person posted one of them online in 2001, and by 2020 the girls – now women – were astonished to find it being discussed on muso forum Rate Your Music. “Pure creative expression of these preteen best friends who love each other and wanted to make art together, and that’s so beautiful,” says one user there; “Definitely on the poppier side of ‘accidentally avant garde music made by children’,” says another.US label Numero approached them about properly releasing the album, which came out on vinyl – with matching nail polish – in January and has further grown X-Cetra’s cult following. (The 1975 frontman Matty Healy was spotted picking up a copy in an LA record shop.) Now the band are back together and the subject of a forthcoming documentary. “It’s been amazing to reconnect musically and creatively with these girls – we’ve already made two songs,” says member Jessica Hall.X-Cetra were four childhood friends, aged between nine and 11: Hall, Ayden Mayeri, and sisters Mary and Janet Washburn. “There were lots of adventures,” says Mary of “iconic” 90s summers spent in their home town of Santa Rosa. “We were talking to boys and eventually going to the mall and stuff, but we were also still able to access imagination and play.” The inseparable four formed their own dance troupe and made lo-fi movies, which usually involved “a mistaken identity or gang members, and always murder”, according to Hall. “It’s that perfect age where you’re not self-conscious about it, you’re just ferociously making stuff.”View image in fullscreen‘Ferociously making stuff’ … (top) Ayden Mayeri and Jessica Hall and (bottom) Janet and Mary Washburn of X-Cetra.When the girls started writing songs, they approached Mary and Janet’s motherRobin O’Brien, a musician active on the home taping scene in the 1980s. “Our mom is very respectful of children’s personhood and was not condescending,” Mary says of the album’s recording. “She wanted to represent us in a very authentic way.” O’Brien helped the girls fit their lyrics and melodies to pre-recorded tracks by a German friend, musician Achim Treu. The album’s resulting disjointed oddness is striking, rather like a sassier version of reality TV star Farrah Abraham’s outsider pop classic My Teenage Dream Ended. Speechless has a lugubrious reggae beat; Promises matches girl-group harmonies with ultra-minimal guitar; Wonderland “is using Alice-in-Wonderland imagery to talk about the discomfort of growing up”, says Hall.Soft sandwiches, street fights and surrealism: Marlene Marder’s memoir of Swiss punks Kleenex/LiliputRead moreMayeri says the Y2K era “is so popular right now with young people, but it’s all very commercial stuff being recreated” – see the remake of I Know What You Did Last Summer, or how pop star Addison Rae channels peak Britney. X-Cetra were drawing from a “whole quilt of stuff we were listening to, ways we were dressing, and things we were doing that you only really know about if you were there,” she says. As well as the Spice Girls, Mariah Carey and Ace of Base, the girls were into Fiona Apple, the Space Jam soundtrack and Pure Moods mail-order CDs. They loved The Craft (“we were doing seances all the time” says Mary) as much as Titanic. “We were distilling what we saw in the culture,” says Mayeri. “It came out in a warped way because we didn’t understand the context. The situations weren’t relatable, but the feelings were.”The band’s lyrics pull from a mix of childhood experience and imagined adulthood. The breezy girlishness of Summer 2000’s title track (“party ’til two, sleep ’til one”) is followed by trip-hop and, on Conversation, themes of domestic violence. “The lyrics can be jarring for people: how do these kids know about these adult topics?” Janet says. “A lot of them are about what we thought could happen in adult relationships. [That age] is such a weird time of mystery and intrigue, with all this unknown stuff ahead of you – it’s exciting but scary.”X-Cetra: Summer Forever – videoJanet says X-Cetra were “ready to become the next Spice Girls”, but after the album was finished, they almost immediately disowned it – a combination of the rapid self-consciousness of turning 13, and their confusion at the “dissonant and haunted” sound of an album that they hoped would resemble the polished pop they heard on the radio. “We wanted to sound like hot teens and good singers,” says Mary. “We sounded like ourselves, which was uncomfortable.” The girls grew up, went to college and left their home town, pursuing careers in tech (Hall), finance (Janet), publishing (Mary) and acting (Mayeri, whose TV and film credits include New Girl and Veep).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

She is co-producing the upcoming documentary about the band, which will feature their home movies from the time, as well as the new music they made after getting together to film reunion footage last year. “We got back together in our home town and it was four days of sleepover energy,” says Mayeri. “We choreographed a dance; we wrote a song with Robin, to see if we could. It was scary as none of us identify as singers, but exciting.” They’ve since done a second session with producer Owen Jackson and songwriter Alexandra Veltri, who has credits with Y2K icons Paris Hilton and Heidi Montag.Becoming X-Cetra again has been a full circle moment for the four friends, now in their 30s, creating without the self-consciousness that can plague teens and twentysomethings. “Once puberty hits you start obsessing about being cool, you get boy-crazy, and all of the creativity goes away,” says Hall. “I completely abandoned a very important part of myself, something that really lit me up as a kid. And now it’s shoving itself back into my life.” Mayeri agrees: “In your 20s you’re trying on different personalities, then in your 30s, you’re like, I just want to be who I really am. It’s been a homecoming for us to all reconnect to that and to each other.”The documentary is almost finished, and the band are keen to continue making music. “We’re still figuring out our collective identity as musicians now,” says Mary. A quarter of a century since Summer 2000, the four friends’ connection and creativity are still palpable – as the Spice Girls said, friendship never ends. “We’re all in,” says Janet. “I want to be making an album when we’re 70.”Summer 2000 is out now on Numero GroupExplore more on these topicsPop and rockR&BfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was very funny.Miuccia [Prada]and I talk about it a lot, and I say to her: ‘Well, it was really good for you.’”The film, Wintour added, “had a lot of humour to it. It had a lot of wit.

For Austen’s fans in the 19th and 20th centuries, it was the illustrations on the page. We wanted to look at how the illustrations married with the words.”Mills said among the images she was particularly fond of was a 19th-century Thomson pen-and-ink drawing of a scene from Mansfield Park featuring Fanny Price and Edmund Bertram. “It’s just so beautiful and there’s such sentiment there.”Thomson was an Irish artist who had made his name in the 1880s illustrating Elizabeth Gaskell’s Cranford. He went on to become one of the most popular and successful book illustrators of the Victorian era.Mills is also keen on the woodcuts done by Hassall forthe Folio Society’s editions. “They are iconic and constantly being reproduced. Early on, there were a lot of male illustrators but as you move towards the 21st century it’s more female illustrators.”She said she wanted to feature costume sketches for the Jerome play partly because it threw forward to the modern incarnations of Darcy, where he starts to become “portrayed as a heart-throb”.Bringing the show almost bang up to date is the sketchbook Coralie Bickford-Smith used to create a modern iteration:Penguin’s “clothbound classic” version of Sense and Sensibility. “I love what Penguin are doing with Coralie Bickford-Smith, taking motifs from the books and making beautiful covers out of them. They are for the modern age but still harking back to the history.”Illustrating Austen, opens on 11 September 2025 and runs to 11 January 2026.

I hope no other family has to go through what mine did.”Stuart responded in an online video, saying Trump was using his children’s books to further his own political agenda, and that the student who made the speech was being used as a pawn.“The irony here is that they want acceptance for their beliefs, but not to extend that acceptance on to others,” the author said.The My Shadow books are not about culture wars, but about helping kids be themselves without prejudice, according to Stuart, whosaid his inbox had been filled with messages of hate since the speech.Stuart’s literary agent, Sarah McKenzie, also responded, stating online that she was proud of his “groundbreaking” picture book.“When Trump and Fox News are angry, you know you’re doing something right,” she said.“Pity the conservative right can’t grasp the simple and beautiful message about acceptance, equality and love.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Among the new signatories are Joaquin Phoenix, Rooney Mara, Emma Stone, James Schamaus, Peter Sarsgaard, Lily Gladstone, Nicola Coughlan, Harris Dickinson, Bowen Yang, Guy Pearce, Jonathan Glazer, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Fisher Stevens, Abbi Jacobson, Eric Andre, Elliot Page, Payal Kapadia and Emma D’Arcy, Variety reported.“As film-makers, actors, film industry workers, and institutions, we recognise the power of cinema to shape perceptions,”the pledgereads. “In this urgent moment of crisis, where many of our governments are enabling the carnage in Gaza, we must do everything we can to address complicity in that unrelenting horror.”But representatives of Israeli cinema are now speaking out against the move, which takes inspiration from the cultural boycott that contributed to the end of apartheid in South Africa. In a statement shared with the Guardian on Tuesday, Nadav Ben Simon, chairman of the Israeli screenwriters’ guild, said he found calls to “boycott Israeli creators” deeply troubling and counterproductive.View image in fullscreenJonathan Glazer with his Oscar for The Zone of Interest, on 10 March 2024.Photograph: Arturo Holmes/Getty Images“For decades, Israeli creators, artists, and storytellers – myself included – have devoted our work to reflecting the complexity of our reality,” he wrote. “We have consistently given voice to Palestinian narratives, criticism of government policies, and the diverse perspectives that shape our society.“Over the years, we have also collaborated with Palestinian colleagues on films, series, and documentaries that seek to encourage dialogue, mutual understanding, peace, and an end to violence.“Calls to boycott Israeli creators are deeply troubling. They do not advance the cause of peace. Instead, they harm precisely those who are committed to fostering dialogue and building bridges between peoples. Such measures risk silencing the very voices striving tirelessly for reconciliation and understanding.”The pledge commits signatories not to screen films, appear at or otherwise work with what it considers complicit institutions – including festivals, cinemas, broadcasters and production companies. Examples of complicity include “whitewashing or justifying genocide and apartheid, and/or partnering with the government committing them”.“We answer the call of Palestinian film-makers, who haveurgedthe international film industry to refuse silence, racism, and dehumanisation, as well as to ‘do everything humanly possible’ to end complicity in their oppression,” the statement reads.However, Simon counters that he had his “fellow creators” remain “steadfast … in the belief that stories are powerful tools for empathy, healing, and connection. We will continue to use our craft to promote dialogue and to strive for an end to violence and the achievement of a just and lasting peace for all who live in our region. Above all, I join the urgent call for an immediate end to the war and for the safe return of all the hostages to their homes and families.“In times like these, we as creators must be devoted to amplifying the light, not deepening the darkness.”View image in fullscreenA still from the film Ahed’s Knee, a Cannes prize winner in 2021.Photograph: Courtesy of the Cannes Film FestivalIn a later note, Simon sought to clarify that “in Israel, there is no such thing as boycotting institutions without affecting creators. In small countries with a unique language, like Israel, almost all original creative work – especially in cinema – is supported by public funding. There are very few Israeli films that are not funded in some way by state-budgeted institutions or foundations. Therefore, any boycott of Israeli institutions is inevitably and directly a boycott of all Israeli creators and Israeli artistic output.”Simon’s statement was echoed in a separate joint statement sent to the Guardian by Lior Elefant, of the Israeli documentary forum, and Merav Etrog Bar, of the Israeli directors guild, who said that creatives were being erroneously conflated with representatives of the Israeli government.“Film-makers in Israel have given voice to complex stories, particularly regarding the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, often including direct criticism of state institutions and their representatives,” their statement read.“Many of the films and series, both documentary and narrative, produced in Israel have dealt with this subject with sensitivity, fairness, and critical thinking; there are thousands of examples of this. While Israeli film-makers are not their government, we bear responsibility for its actions and find ourselves caught between a rock and a hard place: on one side, attempts at silencing from within, and on the other, international boycott from abroad.”View image in fullscreenHamdan Ballal, one of the four directors of Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThey added: “In addition to the many direct victims, the war in Gaza is also burying international collaborations in Israeli culture and cinema. The boycott of Israeli filmmakers and their works has been felt for some time, and now, unfortunately, it is only growing stronger. As we have publicly stated before, we, together with the majority of the Israeli public, call for the immediate and safe release of the hostages, and for an end to the war, the killing, and the suffering on both sides of the border.Since publication of the pledge on Monday, the Israeli Producers Association also issued a statement saying that “the signatories of this petition are targeting the wrong people”.“For decades, we Israeli artists, storytellers and creators have been the primary voices allowing audiences to hear and witness the complexity of the conflict, including Palestinian narratives and criticism of Israeli state policies. We work with Palestinian creators, telling our shared stories and promoting peace and an end to violence through thousands of films, TV series, and documentaries.View image in fullscreenA still from The Band’s Visit (2007), one of the most successful recent Israeli films.Photograph: Ronald Grant“This call for boycott is profoundly misguided. By targeting us – the creators who give voice to diverse narratives and foster dialogue – these signatories are undermining their own cause and attempting to silence us. This shortsighted act seeks to eliminate precisely the collaborative efforts working toward ending violence and achieving peace. We will not allow this and will push back in our efforts to end violence and bring just peace to our region for the benefit of all,” they added.Meanwhile, Avigail Sperber, an Israeli film-maker celebrated by her country’s government,wrote on Facebookof her initial horror at the pledge, before reconsidering her response and concluding that the cost to domestic cinema was negligible compared to that of the current conflict.“The initial, natural response,” [to seeing the Guardian story], she wrote, “was offence and shock. After all, most of us are opposed to this war and the atrocities in the West Bank and Gaza. We create critical art, sign petitions, go to demonstrations. So why are we the target?”Sperber then largely rejected the Producers’ Association’s subsequent repudiation of the pledge, because “as long as these atrocities are carried out in our name, we’re not doing enough. The responsibility is on us, too. And at a moment when I feel helpless, I’m hoping the world succeeds. That they do whatever it takes to force the Israeli government to stop this horrible war. To stop selling us weapons, to recognize a Palestinian state, to break the siege on Gaza.“And yes, our films will be harmed, too. But the cost is worth the chance of ending this bloodshed and starting to heal this bleeding region.”Sperber then put forward an alternative stance she would prefer her country’s industry bodies to adopt:“Thank you, dear colleagues around the world. Thank you for not remaining indifferent to atrocity. Thank you for backing us up, those of us who can’t change this reality on our own. We hope that, with your help, we will succeed in ending this war.”The original pledge, published by the group Film Workers for Palestine, says “the vast majority of Israeli film production and distribution companies, sales agents, cinemas and other film institutions have never endorsed the full, internationally recognised rights of the Palestinian people”.‘The UK should know what their government is supporting’: the Israeli and Palestinian film-makers shining a light on West Bank violenceRead moreIt also notes that there are “a few Israeli film entities that are not complicit” and advises following “guidelines set by Palestinian civil society”.Cinemas in Israel currently generate an estimated $80m of box office revenue, with US blockbusters for the majority of that sum. The domestic industry also drives ticket sales, with period drama Soda and thriller Highway 65 attracting audiences this year.View image in fullscreenA still from 2012’s The Gatekeepers.Photograph: Sony Pictures Classics/Sportsphoto/AllstarBreakout films that appeal internationally are more scarce but not insignificant. Titles to have attracted praise at film festivals globally include Late Marriage, Turn Left at the End of the World and Synonyms, Nadav Lapid’s drama, which won Berlin’s Golden Bear in 2019. Two years later, his followup, Ahed’s Knee, shared the Jury prize at Cannes.In 2011, the Oscar for best short documentary was won by Israel’s Strangers No More, while two years later saw both The Gatekeepers and 5 Broken Cameras, a Palestinian-Israeli-French co-production, nominated for best documentary feature.Meanwhile Eran Kolirin’s The Band’s Visit (2007) and Ari Folman’s Waltz With Bashir (2008) both attracted praise from critics within Israel and worldwide.Notable names not to appear on the petition include the directors ofNo Other Land, the Israeli-Palestinian co-production which documented the forced displacement of Palestinians from their homes in Masafer Yatta, a region in the occupied West Bank targeted by Israeli forces. The film won theOscar for best documentaryearlier this year.The Guardian has contacted them for comment, as well as other film-makers whose names do not appear but who have spoken publicly about the conflict, including Hiam Abbass, Sacha Baron Cohen, Shira Haas, Natalie Portman, Gal Gadot, Ari Folman and László Nemes.Explore more on these topicsFilmIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

You pity everyone around himLucy ManganWed 10 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 10 Sep 2025 13.48 EDTShareIf it comes as a shock to anyone that at some point in the grip of a decades-long addiction to pills, booze and crack cocaine the essentially heterosexualCharlie Sheenoccasionally “turned over the menu” and had sex with men, then I am delighted. I did not know such pockets of naivety could still exist in this benighted world. You sweet things. Enjoy your time!That this is the fact that has made headlines (the few there have been) around the release of the two-part documentary AKA Charlie Sheen is testimony to how little new information there is in it. How, really, could it be otherwise? Every one of the three acts – which in the film he labels “Partying”, “Partying with problems” and “Just problems” – of his adult life has been comprehensively documented by the media in real time. Sometimes that was via stories sold by the people he partied with, sometimes via public hospitalisations and press conferences called by his father Martin Sheen to try to control the press interest. Sometimes it was thanks to Charlie’s own interviews or call-ins to the likes of Alex Jones’s Infowars shows, or ranting videos posted on YouTube about his “tiger blood” and “Adonis DNA” done under the influence, or as a result of the drawn-out divorce proceedings between him and Denise Richards as his substance abuse made their life together untenable. And sometimes it was an amalgam, as whenin 2015 he gave an exclusive interview to NBC’s Today showrevealing his HIV+ status, to end various extortion attempts people had made over the four years since his diagnosis.Martin Sheen and Charlie’s brother Emilio Estevez declined to participate in the film. No one – including Charlie, as he says himself – can blame them. He is clear and it is clear that it is only because of his family’s enduring love that he is here to tell his tale at all. His other brother Ramon, however, is there, along with his daughter Lola, son Bob and their mothers – Richards and Brooke Mueller respectively, Charlie’s second and third wives. The women speak honestly and in Richards’ case very bracingly about him but still the love is clear.You can see why. Charlie, now seven years sober, is inherently warm and effortlessly charming as he’s interviewed by film-maker Andrew Renzi. Likewise, in clips of him giving interviews early in his career, and in footage taken from the Sheen family videos, he and Emilio radiate charisma, too.None of which, of course, means he wasn’t a monster when high. You don’t notice until afterwards how gentle a ride Renzi has given him, how lightly the accusations of domestic violence, the restraining orders, the parental failures and claims that he exposed girlfriends to HIV have been passed over, how much control over the narrative has been placed in Sheen’s hands. He pays what seems to be genuine homage to his family and friends’ patience and compassion – especially his childhood stalwart Tony Todd, who grew up with the Sheens as a neighbour, has never touched drugs or alcohol and nearly cries as he remembers nights at Charlie’s house during his hardest-partying years, hoping he wasn’t going to go into his bedroom the next morning and find him dead. But signs of true contrition, remorse or understanding of the suffering he must have put so many others through are increasingly conspicuous by their absence.There is the odd moment when the glossy facade cracks. Most notably with Heidi Fleiss, the madam against whom Sheen,alone of her clients, testified in court. “The crybaby pussy bitch,” she says, still fibrillating with an almost refreshing rage. And there is Jon Cryer, Sheen’s co-star in Two and a Half Men, whose bone-deep weariness with “the cycle” the actor put the cast and crew through so many times over the years is still apparent. “He was having a tantrum,” he says of the binge Sheen went on after eventually being sacked from the show. “Because he had everything and then he lost it.”There is too little self-examination on Sheen’s part here – and too many wistfully happy smiles as he remembers his partying days – for us to feel any sorrier for him than we do for those around him. Maybe he saves all that for his therapist and gives just the surface stuff to us. Let’s hope so. It would be the healthiest move he has made in his life.AKA Charlie Sheen is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionCharlie SheenreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yikes!Lucy ManganWed 10 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTShare‘This one’s different,” a son says to his mother when she teases him about his latest girlfriend. Clever, he says. Stunning, ambitious, funny – “you remind me of her”. Something flickers across Mummy’s face. “She reminds you of me?” she says, and it is not really a question.Welcome, friends, to The Girlfriend, an adaptation of the excellent psychological thriller by Michelle Frances, and an answer to the question many of us have surely pondered – just how much of an incest vibe can one get away with instilling in a shiny prestige miniseries, and can anyone getRobin Wrightto star and make the whole thing disturbingly credible?The answer to the first half is, “Yikes, quite a lot, starting with a reunion in the family home’s basement pool and catchup chat in the sauna”. The answer to the second is, “Yes you can, and how had we all forgotten how good she is when she spent five years as Claire Underwood in House of Cards? God, who’d be an actor when ungrateful viewers’ memories are so short?”This time she is Laura, a fabulously wealthy gallery owner whose son, Daniel, is the centre of her emotional life. Laurie Davidson, who plays him, conveys abundant charm and intelligence that prevents the character from being sappy or stupid, which would immediately sink the multivalent narrative. But would Daniel still be so important if her husband, Howard (Waleed Zuaiter) were not having a long-term affair and if she hadn’t lost a baby daughter years before? Perhaps not. But perhaps yes. The Girlfriend is a brilliantly slippery beast – it employsRashomon-style flips between Laura’s and the eponymous girlfriend’s perspectives – and likes to keep its options open.View image in fullscreenKeeping its options open … Waleed Zuaiter, Robin Wright and Laurie Davidson in The Girlfriend.Photograph: PAInto this affluent family with its … interesting dynamic comes Cherry (Olivia Cooke, whose delicately ambiguous performance makes the whole thing sing). Cherry is an estate agent whom Daniel meets when shopping for the million-pound flat Ma and Pa want to buy him as he starts his medical training. She is not quite what she seems but – initially, at least – forgivably so. It’s normal to keep your background quiet if you’re young and seeking to better yourself, isn’t it? To give it a bit of a polish in front of your new boyfriend’s parents? Especially if you’ve already heard his mother laughing about your vulgar name with her best friend. And, if she’s going to be so snobbish, why wouldn’t you give in to the temptation to ramp up the public displays of affection in front of her and put a spoke in the wheels of her plans for Daniel’s birthday? Also, if your boss promotes a useless posh colleague over you because of her family connections, wouldn’t you gob in his flask of coffee? Oh. No?View image in fullscreenMakes the whole thing sing … Olivia Cooke in The Girlfriend.Photograph: Christopher Raphael/Courtesy of PrimeGetting the audience to draw lines then have to rub them out when another revelation or interpretation of events is provided is The Girlfriend’s modus operandi. Figures from Cherry’s past appear and, perhaps, suggest that coffee-spit is indeed the sign of a ruthlessly vengeful mind. Or, perhaps Laura finds only what she wants to find. Soon, the paper is fuzzy and every new line you try to draw automatically blurs.The 50 best TV shows to watch this autumnRead moreThe relationship between Laura and Cherry is at first cat and mouse, then an arms race and then – after a pivotal decision – all-out war.The action becomes more extreme and occasionally ludicrous, (such as when a wedding cake apparently packed with exploding offal ruins the nuptials of Cherry’s ex). But, as the six episodes go on, The Girlfriend has plenty of touches that stop full preposterousness from reigning. When, for example, Cherry buys a dress from a boutique she can’t afford, the salesperson warns her there are no returns if it’s been worn. It is as much an act of kindness as a warning, but, either way, it’s a reminder to us and Cherry that the distinctions between Us/Her and Them are ineffable but still infuriatingly detectable.Class distinctions, the power of money, the different kinds of love we are capable of, how liberal parents should be, how emotions can warp under pressure, how desperate we can become to be believed, and how we distinguish between ambition and greed, need and desire. All this is at play in The Girlfriend, which has lost little of the book’s psychological acuity and retained all of the suspense. Not one to watch with your sons, perhaps, but otherwise – enjoy.The Girlfriend is on Prime Video nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewRobin WrightreviewsShareReuse this content"

Neeson plays a hitman with early dementia on one last job, only to find that his target is a child – which is against his hitman code. He refuses, forcing him on the run.

She has now delivered a superb second novel that features another fascinating central character, though in a much darker, more disturbing context.A Splintering is the story of Tara, one of five siblings from a poor farming family in the hinterlands of Pakistani Punjab. This is the kind of landscape where age-old codes of manhood, with brother or son as provider and adjudicator of women’s lives, still rule. Tara, gazing at the stars from their courtyard at night, wants to get away from the squalor of Mazinagar (literally, past city), where most people live and die unnoticed, and build a life full of money and possessions in the city. She has no romantic notions about the soporific countryside. “I have no nobility. I come from darkness and filth.”Tara marries an unambitious accountant from the city and quickly absorbs the mores of urban life, but wants more and more every day, for her children and for herself, and finds she is willing to do anything for it.Tara and her belligerent brother Lateef are a compelling duo. Though both strive to rise above their circumstances, the latter receives the unearned privileges of patriarchy. Like Tara, he seeks money, sends his son to private school (although not his daughters), but would have preferred it if his sister didn’t make a living outside the home.The sibling trajectories are sketched in parallel; the man allowed license, the woman forever judged and examined, a twin portrayal masterfully deployed to expose crushing divides of gender and class. Of the two, Tara is the deeper and more complex figure, ultimately tragic, who ends up paying a staggeringly steep price for her pursuit of freedom and desire.Patriarchal modes define everything, even the terms of defiance that women seeking freedom and power must deployThere are passages of strikingirony and insight packed into small scenes, as when Tara needs to teach her daughter, unhappy at having to make do with secondhand textbooks, the virtues of being content with one’s lot. She has just made a life-altering compromise herself for material gain. Fearing violence from her bookish and gentle husband, at one point she says: “Money was the only levee against indignity.”While Tara is the driving force of her story, I was fascinated by her mother, too. She comes to vivid life, her quick and bitter tongue a mirror of all the survivor-victims of patriarchy in south Asia and elsewhere. As someone who has both battled and suffered the men in her life, she’s the conscience of the novel. Escaping the lifelong service of her husband in the village to live in the city with her now wealthy son, who also puts her to use, she encompasses the full scale of what it is to be a woman in old and new Pakistan. Patriarchal modes define everything, even the terms of defiance that women seeking freedom and power must deploy. The scenes involving the two are among the most moving in the novel; the bond between a daughter, willing to do anything for her dreams, and her enabling, worldly-wise mother, is brought alive with psychological intricacy and beauty.The part that doesn’t work so well is Tara’s escape into imaginary films in her head. Though these reveries are perhaps meant as metafictional signifiers of Tara’s desperate urge to write her own story, they take away from, rather than sharpen, what is for the most part a riveting story told by a woman who is both engineer and destroyer of her life. Amna’s prose has fizz and energy perfectly suited to the subject matter: it captures the fetid backwaters of poverty that Tara loathes and the glittering, corrupting city life she wants to own. Major events in Pakistan’s recent history punctuate the narrative unobtrusively, serving as loose scaffolding.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

He was the UK’s deputy prime minister from 2010 to 2015, a position from which he was surely pulled in multiple directions as he attempted to bridge the divide between David Cameron’s Conservatives and his own Liberal Democrats. A few years later he chose another challenging role, serving as Meta’s vice-president and then president of global affairs from 2018 until January 2025, where he was responsible for bridging the very different worlds of Silicon Valley and Washington DC (as well as other governments). How to Save the Internet is Clegg’s report on how he handled that Herculean task, along with his ideas for how to make the relationships between tech companies and regulators more cooperative and effective in the future.The main threat that Clegg addresses in the book is not one causedbythe internet; it is the threattothe internet from those who would regulate it. As he puts it: “The real purpose of this book is not to defend myself orMetaor big tech. It is to raise the alarm about what I believe are the truly profound stakes for the future of the internet and for who gets to benefit from these revolutionary new technologies.”But in fact, a great deal of the book is devoted to a defence of Meta and big tech, and that defence begins by conflating the internet (which is widely loved) with social media (a subset of internet activity that evokes more ambivalence). In his discussion of the “techlash” – the sharp turn in public opinion against big tech in the late 2010s – he asks: “Would we choose to turn off certain technologies if we could? Would we deny ourselves the next innovation? Would we be better off without the freedoms of the open internet?”As it happens, I recently conducted a survey with the Harris Poll thatasked questions rather like theseto a nationally representative sample of young American adults – the very generation whose adolescence was grabbed and shaped by a few social media companies. We asked respondents to tell us, for various platforms and products, whether they wished each “was never invented”. The percentage of gen Z who regret the existence of the internet is low – 17%. For smartphones it is just 21%. But for the big social media platforms, regret is much higher, ranging from 34% for Instagram (which is owned by Meta) to 47% for TikTok and 50% for X. In our subsequentsurvey of parents, levels of regret about the existence of social media are higher still.Other researchershave made similar findings.In other words, yes, many of us would choose to turn off certain technologies if we could. Clegg frames the choice as a binary: open internet versus no internet. But the most serious problems are related to social media, which can be regulated without destroying “the internet”, and which is much harder to defend.Yet Clegg attempts to do so. In the first chapter he addresses the twin charges that social media has damaged global democracy and teen mental health. He acknowledges that both declined in the 2010s, but he claims that the declines merely correlate with the rise to dominance of social media, and are not caused by it. He cites academic studies, but his descriptions of them are Meta’s standard talking points, which ignore the manystudieson theother side. In fact, Clegg takes much of his defence word for word froma rebuttal essaythat Meta put out in 2022 in response toone of my essayslaying out the case that social media is harming advanced democracies.Clegg’s claim that the evidence of harm is merely correlational is contradicted by dozens of Meta employees, contractors, whistleblowers, and leaked documentsSo in this book, Clegg gives us Meta’s party line, but on teen mental health he once thought differently. Dozens of US state attorney generals are suing Meta, and the documents they have obtained show us who knew what, and when they knew it. Fromthe brieffiled by the attorney general of New Mexico we learn that on 27 August 2021, Clegg forwarded an email to Mark Zuckerberg from an employee requesting more resources to address teen mental health concerns. Clegg added his own plea at the top, saying that it was “increasingly urgent” to address “concerns about the impact of our products on young people’s mental health”. Clegg noted that the company’s “well-being work is both understaffed and fragmented”. Zuckerberg did not respond to the email.Clegg’s current claim that the evidence of harm is merely correlational, and that the correlations are too small to be taken seriously, is contradicted by dozens ofMeta employees,contractors,whistleblowers, andleakeddocumentsthat showotherwise. To take just one example, in abrieffrom the attorney general of Tennessee we learn about a 2019 study Meta commissioned on teenage mental health. The researchers alerted Meta that “[teens] are hooked despite how it makes them feel … Instagram is addictive, and time-spend on the platform is having a negative impact on mental health”. A bit later: “Instagram is the worst platform for mental health.”Turning to his proposals for how to save the internet, Clegg lays out two pillars: “radical transparency” and collaboration. On transparency, he urges tech companies to be more forthcoming about how their algorithms work and how they make their decisions. He warns: “If the masters of Silicon Valley refuse to open up, the choice will be taken out of their hands.”On collaboration, he calls for a “digital democracies alliance”, because he is concerned, rightly, that China has developed its technologies in ways that shore up its authoritarian system. He wants the democracies of the world to act together so that the internet might live up to the democracy-promoting visions so many of us shared in the 1990s.Would Clegg’s plan work? Transparency is great in theory, but I fear that it may be too late to apply these principles to the powerful companies that now control much of the internet. As tech journalist Kara Swisher memorablysaid in 2019, Zuckerberg and the other founders “built a city without street signs, without sewage, without police, without garbage men. Imagine that city. It’s not a good city to live in, but they collect all the rent on everything.” This is why scammers, sextortionists, drug dealers and political extremists thrive on these platforms and pose dangers to teens and to democracies that the big companies seem unable to fix. More transparency in 2026 may not be enough to repair the terrible urban design laid down 20 years ago.Big tech is picking apart European democracy, but there is a solution: switch off its algorithms | Johnny RyanRead moreAs for collaboration, it’s hard to imagine companies like Meta giving up their data or their sovereignty, especially now that the tech moguls have so much support from the Trump administration, and now that the Trump administration is so willing to apply pressure on other countries. If the masters of Silicon Valley refuse to collaborate, it’s just not clear to me that “the choice will be taken out of their hands”. By whom?The great biologist and ant expert EO Wilson once said about Marxism: “Good ideology. Wrong species.” After reading this, plus several of the many books about Meta’s unethical, careless, “break things” culture, as well as hundreds of pages from the 2021 document leak known as The Facebook Files and from ongoing lawsuits, I suggest we might say something similar about Clegg’s proposals: “Good plan. Wrong industry.”Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist and author of The Anxious Generation (Penguin).How to Save the Internet: The Threat to Global Connection in the Age of AI and Political Conflict by Nick Clegg is published Bodley Head (£25).

The blunt premise is custom built for death and suffering: 50 young American men are selected by lottery for an annual marathon march. If any walker slows to less than three miles per hour, or strays off the road, they are removed from the competition – by being shot in the head at point-blank range. The final survivor wins whatever they want, they’re promised.Why these men would volunteer for a competition with such unfavourable odds we’re left to wonder, as the broader authoritarian society in which the story is set – which looks a lot like 1960s America – is barely seen or explained. It’s clear who we’re rooting for though: Cooper Hoffman’s Ray Garraty, who is dropped off at the starting line by his tearful mother (Judy Greer), then it’s off to the races. Garraty is an all-round decent soul, who befriends and encourages his fellow competitors, particularly Pete, played by British actor David Jonsson (who’s come a long way fromRye Lane). Their growing friendship is the film’s heart, and both actors are innately charming and natural, though both have deeper, darker histories and motivations to reveal.The vibe is initially reminiscent of Stand By Me, another King story about young men bonding on the road: bantering, sharing stories, chatting about nothing and everything. There are some entertaining supporting characters: spiky, bullying Barkovitch (Charlie Plummer) and cocky but vulnerable Olson (Ben Wang) in particular. At its best, the story slots into an easy rhythm, though the camaraderie is destined not to last, as the tiring pack is routinely winnowed down by the accompanying military (led by a cartoonishly shouty commander played by Mark Hamill), and almost every horrific head shot is rendered in full, blood-spurting detail.King wrote this story in 1967, when it doubtless resonated with the random, pointless slaughter and the male comradeship of the Vietnam war. It remains to be seen how it will land in an age of flashier death-game stories such as Squid Game and The Hunger Games (or, for that matter, the imminent remake of King’s The Running Man), although the plight of troubled young men in a fascist society is still very much a live issue, of course.Director Francis Lawrence has form here: he directed several of the Hunger Games movies, but he seems determined to take a different tack here. Unlike the gaudy setting of those films, the only sense of the wider dystopian society we get here, apart from a few brief flashbacks, is the landscape the competitors wander through: an almost deserted, often picturesque rural America that looks like a William Eggleston photo album come to life.It’s mentioned that the walk is being filmed and broadcast, but we don’t really hear about that again. And although some practicalities are addressed (defecation alert!), the human endurance aspect of the exercise is skirted over at times. At one point a walker has a problem with his shoes, for example, and is forced to discard them – a game-changing incident, you might think, but it is never mentioned again. And on they stagger towards the preordained conclusion, straining viewer endurance as much as their own.The result comes across like a cross between a buddy movie and a horror movie – a war movie without the war. Ultimately, it all comes down to the core relationships, so it’s just as well that Hoffman and Jonsson are both terrific; their stars are certain to rise further off the back of this. But it is left to the viewer to fill in the gaps, suppress their niggling questions and just go along with it. Maybe, to mangle a familiar saying, the real treasure is the friends they made along the way, most of whom unfortunately get shot in the head.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

And yet this powerful and complex documentary, directed by Brandon Kramer (a distant relative of some of the people involved) and co-produced by Darren Aronofsky, is a reminder that the situation now can’t be understood without remembering the Hamas massacre – how it was calculated to provoke a rage-filled reaction that would discredit Israel internationally, what it meant and continues to mean within Israel and how the political and ideological connotations of the hostages have themselves evolved.At first, the hostages’ images were widely seen as a focus for outrage and a casus belli. Posters put up in cities showing the hostageswere ripped down- to the fury of their families. But now the hostages’ images are associated more with anti-Netanyahu, anti-war-at-all-costs sentiment, with the families demanding real negotiating progress in getting them home.The subject of this film is Liat Beinin Atzili, a teacher, and her artist husband Aviv Atzili who were kidnapped from their kibbutz; Liat was finally to be returned but Aviv murdered. Kramer’s camera captures the heartwrenching agony of Liat’s elderly parents in the US, Yehuda and Chaya, as they wait for news; they are secular-leaning liberals with a “Bernie” bumper sticker on their car. Yehuda is a thoughtful, sensitive man who wishes, even at this moment of agony, to acknowledge the Palestinians’ historical pain, but his grandson Netta, Liat’s son, who escaped capture at the kibbutz, is angrily dismissive of these scruples: “Fuck them, they need to die.”‘It’s so different from the media narrative’: telling a different story of 7 OctoberRead moreThe family travels to the US to put their case to senators and high-ranking officials, but Yehuda is dismayed to see that they are being used to justify hawkish views that he does not share. These inexpressibly painful family disagreements are laid bare, most jarringly with a tearful argument between Yehuda and Chaya. Holding Liat is a valuable work, not least for showing us thatIsraeland Netanyahu are not synonymous.Holding Liat is in UK cinemas from 12 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s inspired by thetrue-life story of Jerry and Joseph Kane, father and son anti-government extremists; Jerry was a self-proclaimed “sovereign citizen” who believed that the government was illegitimate and he could decide which laws to opt out of. He’s played here by Nick Offerman (Ron Swanson in Parks and Recreation), giving a vein-popping, fist-clenchingly believable performance. We see Jerry’s boiling inferno through the eyes of his son Joe (Jacob Tremblay), a quiet, thoughtful teenager urged by his dad to be an independent thinker (so long as he thinks the same as Jerry).It isArkansas, 2010. Sixteen-year-old Joe opens the door to a sheriff handing him an eviction notice; his dad is behind on the mortgage payments. Even when he has the money, Jerry won’t pay the bank on principle. He’s a minor celebrity, a regular on right-wing radio stations, travelling the midwest in a white suit like a cheap preacher giving seminars on how to avoid mortgage foreclosures (a hat gets passed around at the end for donations).The skill of Offerman’s performance is showing Jerry’s charisma – but also the shallowness of it. He’s every bit as desperate as the people he advises, with a terrifying streak of nihilism. Tremblay is equally convincing as poor Joe. When his dad is briefly jailed for traffic violations (he refuses to carry a driver’s licence or insure the car) there is a brief window of opportunity for Joe to escape Jerry’s conspiracies.Slightly less interesting is the parallel drama about an old-school tough police chief (Dennis Quaid) and his newly qualified police officer son (Thomas Mann). We watch the police trainees putting each other in chokeholds – a metaphor for the film’s theme of overbearing dads. Still, this is muscular stuff, with a firm grip on your attention.Sovereign is on digital platforms from 15 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsCrime filmsArkansasNick OffermanreviewsShareReuse this content"

For the Scottish academic who is granted an audience with Cambodia’s Pol Pot in Jack MacGregor’s play, the first encounter leaves him blandly upbeat. “He seems quite nice,” he tells his friend, a sceptical American journalist.His naivety verges on the comic, but the play is at its most gripping when it takes the opinions of this specialist in economic history seriously. Played by Bobby Bradley, and known only as Stranger, he is the author of In Defence of Kampuchea, a paean to the Khmer Rouge, and is predisposed to see the good in policies such as the centralisation of a money-free economy.Played by David Lee-Jones, and known as Brother, the dictator plays teasing power games with his visitor, taciturn one moment, garrulous the next. Even at his most manipulative in Andrea Ling’s production forA Play, a Pie and a Pint, he is in earnest about his politics. “Cities are poisons for the mind,” may not be a conventional viewpoint but it appears to be honestly held.It is hard to take issue with the journalist, played gutsily by Nicole Cooper, and her horror at a regime that seeks to “divide, dehumanise and destroy”. But the play is at its most interesting when it entertains the possibility of Stranger’s point that capitalist values lead us to dismiss alternative ideologies too readily.When Brother admits to executing his political enemies, Stranger crumbles and the academic’s awakening robs the play of its dramatic tension. You would expect some self-justification, but Stranger’s capitulation is total and the play’s nuance becomes blunted – all Bradley can do is quiver. It turns out genocidal dictators are not so nice after all.AtÒran Mór, Glasgow, until 13 September.

As well as being a choreographer, Requardt is a psychotherapist, and she explained what would have been happening in the woman’s nervous system at the time, the famous “fight, flight or freeze” state (the sympathetic nervous system) versus the “rest and digest” state (parasympathetic). Our ability to cope with these fluctuating states is called the “window of tolerance” and that morning in the cafe, the window didn’t just crack, the glass was blown out completely.Franzmann and Requardt knew straight away this made for the beginnings of a show, and the coffee-shop incident has become the basis for an enjoyable and informative dance-theatre piece,Anatomy of Survival, that the pair have co-created. Alongside a lighthearted psychology lecture, it features the accounts of 23 (fictional) witnesses, who, crucially, all have a completely different take on what happened and who was in the wrong. The text is shot through with jolting cymbal crashes that put the audience into red-alert mode and there are shaking and quaking dances for performers Solène Weinachter, Bea Bidault and Kath Duggan, and, because Requardt’s work is never far from a swerve into the surreal, the unexplained appearance of a large brown bear.View image in fullscreen‘I am yet to meet a person who wants to be really uncontrollably angry’ … Anatomy of Survival.Photograph: Camilla GreenwellThe pair enjoyed digging into research. “One thing therapists really like to do is more training,” says Requardt. “There is just so much to learn about how to deal with the human condition!” Her current training is, appropriately, on nervous system regulation and dysregulation, a trauma-therapy approach called Somatic Experiencing, which involves focusing on internal sensations rather than thoughts in order to modify stress responses. Sounds useful – let’s face it, we’ve probably all had an irrational blow-out from time to time. “Living in a big city, you really see the grind of life,” says Franzmann. “The noise, the bustle, the mess, everyone trying to keep it together financially, practically, maintaining friendships and relationships, emotional pressures, economic pressures … It’s a potential powder keg.”Requardt mentions road rage as a situation where anger can suddenly escalate and take hold, in a way that’s often disproportionate to the situation. Has she ever lost it in a public place? “Yes, I was never great at queueing,” she admits. “Sometimes it is surprising that it doesn’t happen more often,” she says, going into psychotherapist mode. “My question would be: what happens instead? What are we doing when we are ‘behaving’? Are we yielding, suppressing or pushing an experience to one side or are we actually OK?” Requardt suggests that instead of “taming our experiences”, it’s healthier to engage in a relationship with our emotional responses, and “increase our ability to be with intensity”. Easier said than done, you might be thinking.One of the key takeaways from the show is the way every witness sees the situation differently. Was the customer provoked, or was she just “crazy”? Was she asking for trouble or did the server deliberately misunderstand her? “One of my interests is the question of what reality actually is,” says Requardt, “and that it’s experienced vastly differently by people.” Our perception of whether another person is harmless or to be feared, or if a situation is benign or dangerous, can be dictated by how switched-on our sympathetic nervous system has got used to being.‘We spent a week on the cow birth!’ The eye-opening play about animals with sound effects instead of wordsRead moreWe assume our own view of the world is the “real” reality. “It can feel unsettling to allow the idea that someone else’s take is just as true,” says Requardt. Sometimes we might need to allow “the tight version of our own take on reality to loosen enough to let in someone else’s deeply felt reality,” she suggests. “There is always a reason why someone’s behaviour escalates,” Requardt says. “I am yet to meet a person who wants to be really uncontrollably angry.” Not that we shouldn’t be held accountable for our actions, she quickly adds, but if for any reason we didn’t grow up feeling completely safe and secure in our environment and relationships, that can have a huge impact on our ability to ride out stress.“For me,” says Requardt, “it’s important to understand that if you happen to be an incredibly regulated person who can handle all that life throws at you and stay calm in a crisis, then you got really lucky.”Anatomy of Survival is atShoreditch Town Hall, London, 11-12 September and atthe Place, London, 23-24 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreDancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The red linoleum floor and minimalist interior do little to soften the impact; I wonder how I’m going to sleep. On the opposite side of the corridor, another member of the group I’m travelling with has a much cooler studio, complete with a small balcony that I immediately recognise from archive black and white photographs.Unconsciously echoing the building’s past, we start using this as a common room, perching on the tubular steel chairs, browsing the collection of books on the desk and discussing what it must have been like to live here. At night, my room stays warm and noise travels easily through the walls and stairwells; it’s not the best night’s rest I’ve ever had, but it’s worth it for the experience.I’m in Dessau, Germany, in the accommodation block once inhabited by students and junior masters at the famousBauhausschool. Also known as the Prellerhaus, the studios are part of a larger asymmetrical complex of connected workshops, classrooms and social spaces – the iconic Bauhaus Building.View image in fullscreenA guest room in the student accommodation block at the Bauhaus school in Dessau.Photograph: Tenschert, Yvonne, 2022/Bildnachweis siehe BeschreibungDesigned by German architect and Bauhaus founderWalter Gropiusafter the school moved here in 1925, and completed in 1926, the revolutionary structure is a mix of glass, steel and concrete. It was a physical expression of the school’s ideas and remains a symbol of European modernism to this day. “It landed here like an alien spaceship,” says Oliver Klimpel, head of the curatorial workshop at the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation.Founded in Weimar in 1919, the highly influential school rejected the principles of local and traditional architecture and design and pursued those that were simple, rational and functional, using innovative ways of teaching and working. Forced to leave Weimar just six years later, owing to financial and political pressure, the school relocated to Dessau in Saxony-Anhalt – then a rising industrial hub with an entrepreneurial spirit and social democratic government – a century ago this year.View image in fullscreenBauhaus students on a balcony of the Prellerhaus, 1931.Photograph: Stiftung Bauhaus DessauWhat followed was a highly successful period for the school and a stronger focus on developing prototypes of furniture, household objects and other items for mass production. Art increasingly merged with industry. “They switched from solid wood to plywood sheets, from upholstery to steel tubes and iron yarn,” our guide, Anke John, explains, standing in Gropius’s old office, where the stench from the triolin floor still lingers. It was in Dessau that Marcel Breuer designed the iconic Wassily Chair, for example.Bauhaus buildings also sprung up across town, before the rise of National Socialism saw the school move again in 1932, this time to Berlin, for one final year before the Nazis came to power.“The empty rooms in the workshop wing appear clean and spacious now, but they were packed with different workshops for printing, weaving, woodwork and metalwork, with tools and machines; it was messy and loud, a maker’s space,” explains Klimpel, adding that the common portrayal of a perfectionist modernist practice in an art school can be very misleading.While regular heatwaves were less of a problem in the 1920s – temperatures were in the high 30s when I visited – the three-storey glass curtain wall, in pursuit of transparency, still created difficult, greenhouse-like conditions in summer. “It was part of the practical research to see what worked and what didn’t; you learned with the building and lived within the experiment,” adds Klimpel.Set among towering oaks and pines, the Masters’ Houses are where Kandinsky, Klee, Moholy-Nagy and Gropius once livedThe structure has undergone changes over time, including repairs to wartime bomb damage, reconstruction of the facade in 1976, and an extensive restoration project based on the original plans, completed in 2006. Today it’s home to a shop, a cafe, exhibition spaces and the offices of the non-profitBauhaus Dessau Foundation. The students’ studios are open to overnight guests, each one kitted out with Bauhaus-inspired furniture, some in the style of former residents such asJosef Albers(studio 204) andMarianne Brandt(studio 302).View image in fullscreenThe Masters’ Houses where Kandinsky, Klee and Gropius once lived.Photograph: Tenschert, Yvonne, 2015/Bildnachweis siehe BeschreibungVisitors can also head to other Bauhaus-related locations in town using a signposted cycle route, taking the number 10 bus (the Bauhauslinie) or by joining a guided tour. I start by walking over to the restored Masters’ Houses, just a short distance away from the Bauhaus Building. Set among towering oaks and pines, these cubic-like white structures with black window frames, plus two abstract rebuilds, are where key figures such asKandinsky,Klee,Moholy-Nagyand Gropius once lived with their families. It feels sleepy and subdued here now, quiet enough to hear acorns crunching under my feet.Other spots not to miss include theKornhaus, a restaurant with a semicircular glazed conservatory on the banks of the Elbe, built in 1929; theArbeitsamt, the yellow-brick employment office designed by Gropius in 1929; and the Dessau Törten housing estate (1926-28), with its rows of modest two-storey, flat-roofed homes, developed to address the housing shortage. The strikingBauhaus Museum, designed by architects from Barcelona and open since 2019, provides plenty of background information and is home to the second largest collection of Bauhaus-related objects in the world, including teaching notes and drafts from the workshops.View image in fullscreenThe Kornhaus, a former restaurant designed in 1929 by Bauhaus architect Carl Fieger.Photograph: Ronny Hartmann/Getty ImagesTo mark the centenary of the school’s move to Dessau, a programme of events and exhibitions – titledAn die Substanz/To the Core– will take place throughout 2025 and 2026, focusing on materials of the modern era. Celebrations kick off this month and include modern interpretations of the so-called Material Dances, part of the course Der Mensch (The Human Being), introduced by Bauhaus teacher Oskar Schlemmer in 1928. Other highlights will includeInvisible Bauhaus Dessau, a new digital tour covering the early days of the Bauhaus members in Dessau, and five central exhibitions opening in March 2026.Berlin by rail: a cold-war adventureRead moreIn between the festivities and the Bauhaus sites, it’s impossible not to notice the decline of this city, which has been merged with Roßlau since 2007. Blocks of GDR flats with worn-down facades are easy to spot and the streets feel quiet, almost deserted, at times. Like many places in eastern Germany, reunification has seen the population shrink, and gradually age. In recent years, the rightwing party Alternative für Deutschland has gained increasing support in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, itsinfluence extending to culture and the Bauhaus.Coming here requires a degree of imagination and reflection. You have to remind yourself that these buildings and ideas were completely new, occasionally provocative, in the 1920s. That the Bauhaus teachers really lived in those white houses. That the workshops were loud and dusty. That students held wild parties and piled out on to those balconies. That Dessau was once a booming place. That this school from a corner of Germany has found its way into everyday design around the world.The trip was supported by theGerman tourist board.

Meringue shards make a lovely finishing touch to all kinds of desserts, from a rich trifle to an avant-garde pavlova or that timeless classic, the Eton mess. As for the leftover yolk, I have several recipes, includingspaghetti carbonara(also featuringsalt-cured egg yolksthat make a wonderful alternative to parmesan) andbrown banana curd.One-egg meringue shards with an Eton mess of strawberry, black pepper and basilArchitect Renzo Pianois said to have sketched his original idea for the Shard on the back of a restaurant napkin. Similarly, whenever I design a more conceptual dish such as this one, I love to start by drawing it in my sketchbook, to develop an idea of what the dish will look like, and while I was drawing the angular lines of the Shard, it reminded me of a minimalist dessert I’d eaten at the seminalAT restaurant in Paristhat featured grey meringue shards that seemed to me to perfectly emulate the dramatic geometry of that iconic London building.But this dish isn’t just visually appealing. Black pepper, strawberries and basil are an unexpected yet classical combination: there’s herbaceous, sweet and savoury complexity from the basil, freshness from the naturally sweet strawberries and a pop of heat from the super-sweet black pepper meringue that adds an unexpected warmth that is then subdued by the cream. If you’re lucky enough to spot any reduced-price berries in the supermarket, this is a great way to make use of past-their-best strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and even blueberries.Prep20 min(plus resting time)Cook1 hr 30 minServes4For the meringue shards1 egg white37g caster sugar37g icing sugar, sifted¼ tsp cream of tartar(optional)⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepperA small pinch of saltFor the mess200g ripe strawberries, or other berries1 tbsp caster sugar, or to tasteZest and juice of ¼ lemonA few fresh basil leaves220ml clotted cream, or double cream whipped until stiffHeat the oven to 110C (90C fan)/gas ¾, and line a large baking tray with a silicone mat or unbleached baking paper. Crack the egg white into a clean, grease-free bowl or jar. Add the caster sugar, icing sugar, cream of tartar if using, and ground black pepper, then whisk with an electric hand whisk or in a stand mixer on high speed for five to 10 minutes, until the mix forms very firm, glossy peaks.Spoon the meringue on to the lined baking tray, then smooth it out into a thin, even layer. Bake for about an hour and a half, or until the surface is crisp and dry to the touch but hasn’t taken on any colour. Remove and leave to cool completely on the tray, then lift the meringue off the paper and snap it into long, jagged shards.Meanwhile, hull the strawberries and cut them into cubes. Finely slice the basil leaves. Put both in a bowl, add the sugar, lemon zest and juice, and mix gently but thoroughly. Cover and put in the fridge for at least an hour, though overnight would be best.Just before serving, thin the clotted cream with a little of the strawberry juices from the bottom of the bowl, being careful not to overmix it, or it will turn buttery.Spoon a generous dessertspoonful of the cream into the centre of each of four pudding bowls and spread it out gently with the back of the spoon to create a well. Fill the well with a generous spoonful of the macerated strawberries, then arrange some meringue shards on top, allowing them to lean and jut out like miniature crystalline towers, concealing some of the fruit beneath. Serve at once, crushing the meringue into the berries and cream as you eat.Explore more on these topicsDessertWaste notFoodFood wasteEggsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In fruit salads and the famous Penang laksa, the mix of sweet, tangy, salty and acidic is so vibrant and distinctive that, for me, it is almost synonymous with the country of my birth and, more importantly, its incredible range of foods and flavours. Naturally, then, I wanted to recreate that in a cake. The choice of an upside-down cake was obvious when thinking about pineapple, and adding tamarind to the caramel felt an exciting addition to the flaky sea salt we all know and love. I have always been intrigued by the fact that small children, my own included, who seem so sensitive to spice in anything else, love gingerbread cookies, which have such a robust flavour profile and warm spiciness. When my boys were going for a birthday sleepover, I had the idea of translating Nigella Lawson’s chocolate Guinness cake into a ginger version, replacing the stout with ginger beer. It was a very successful experiment – the cake retains all the damp luxury of the original, with a backbite of ginger that engages intriguingly with the chocolate. The children loved it, as did the adults.Chocolate ginger beer cakeThe kind of ginger beer you use will make a difference here, so try a few and see which you like best. Once baked, the flavour of the ginger dissipates somewhat, so err on the side of a ginger beer with a strong presence. I likeFever-Tree.Prep10 minCook1 hr 25 minMakes16 squaresFor the cake250ml ginger beer250g unsalted butter, sliced into about 6 pieces60g unsweetened cocoa powder(preferably Dutch-processed)250g caster sugar130g soured cream2 eggs1tbsp vanilla extract270g plain flour½tsp fine sea salt2tsp bicarbonate of sodaFor the icing250g cream cheese, at room temperature100g icing sugar,sifted100mldoublecream50ml ginger beerFlaked chocolate, to garnishGrease and line a 20cm square or round cake tin with baking paper, and heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Combine the ginger beer and butter in a large, wide saucepan large enough for the whole cake to be mixed in, so about three-litre capacity. Set it over a medium heat and stir gently until the butter melts. Off the heat, sift in the cocoa powder and sugar, whisk to combine, then leave to cool for five minutes.Meanwhile, whisk the soured cream, eggs and vanilla in a jug, then pour into the ginger beer mix and whisk gently. Sift the flour, salt and bicarbonate of soda into the batter and whisk gently until smooth and combined. Pour the batter into the lined tin and bake for about 55 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Remove, leave to cool for 10 minutes, then remove from the tin and transfer to a rack to cool completely.Meanwhile, put the cream cheese in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-low until smooth. Turn down the speed to low, add the icing sugar and beat for about 30 seconds, until incorporated. Add the cream and ginger beer, turn up the speed to medium and beat for one to two minutes, until thick and smooth. Refrigerate until needed.To serve, use a spatula to spread the icing thickly over the cake. Scatter the flaked chocolate over the top, then serve. The un-iced cake will keep for about two days, but, once iced, it’s best to eat on the same day.Pineapple pudding cake with salted tamarind caramelView image in fullscreenTamarind concentrate comes in differentforms, from thick and dense to thin and watery. For this cake, choose a Thai liquid tamarind concentrate – it is milder, sweeter and smoother in texture than the Indian style, which tends to be strongly tangy, earthy and chunkier, and more suitable for curries and chutneys.Prep10 minCook1 hr 30 minCool30 minServes6-81 small pineapple(about 1kg)For the caramel50g unsalted butter100g soft dark brown sugar60g Thai liquid tamarind concentrate½tsp flaky sea saltFor the batter160g plain flour2tsp baking powder½tsp fine sea salt50g room-temperature unsalted butter150g caster sugarFinely grated zest of 2 limes1½tsp fennel seeds, lightly toasted, then finely ground (optional)1 large egg, plus 1 large egg white, both at room temperature1tsp vanilla extract120mldoublecream, plus extra to serveLine the base and sides of a 5cm-deep and 20cm-round solid cake tin with baking paper. Cut the top and bottom off the pineapple, then stand it on one end. Following the contours of the pineapple, remove the peel by slicing it off, from top to bottom, then quarter the pineapple lengthways. Cut away the hard central core and remove the black “eyes” by slicing deep V-cuts on either side of them. You should now have four long pieces, weighing about 600g in total. Cut each piece from the short side into small, thin, fan-shaped pieces (about 5mm) and put them in a bowl. Set aside while you prepare the caramel.For the caramel, combine the 50g butter and brown sugar in a small saucepan on a medium heat and stir until both have melted and the mixture just begins to simmer. Stir in the tamarind, then bring back to a simmer, take off the heat and stir in the salt. Carefully scrape the caramel into the lined tin, then arrange the pineapple slices on top, overlapping them so there are no gaps. When the base is covered, overlap a second layer of pineapple on top, then set aside.Heat the oven to 195C (175C fan)/380F/gas 5½. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a small bowl.Put the butter, sugar, lime zest and fennel seeds (if using) in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-high for two minutes. The mixture will be somewhat lighter, but not exactly fluffy at this stage, because of the relatively small amount of butter.Add the egg, egg white and vanilla, and beat on medium speed for about a minute, until fully combined. Turn down the speed to low, add a third of the dry sifted ingredients and half the cream, then mix for a few seconds to combine. Repeat with another third of the flour and the remaining cream. Finally, incorporate the last of the flour and mix on low speed until smooth.Scrape the batter carefully on top of the pineapple and smooth with a small spatula to form an even top. Bake for about 50 minutes, until the cake is lightly golden on top and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.Remove the cake from the oven and let it sit undisturbed on a rack for at least 30 minutes for the caramel to settle, then invert it on to a platter. Serve with cream on the side.Napkin cakes with blackberry and white chocolate creamView image in fullscreenWhenSweet, the book I co-authored with Yotam Ottolenghi, came out in 2017, I was invited to talk about baking on a baking podcast calledFlour Hour, hosted by Jeremiah Duarte Bills and Amanda Faber, who were both contestants on The Great American Baking Show. Inevitably, I spoke a lot about my baking process and journey, but, to be honest, I was more interested in hearing Jeremiah speak about his own specialty, namely Portuguese baking. My interest piqued, I then signed up for one of Jeremiah’s online baking tutorials and was delighted to discover that we were makingguardanapos, gorgeous little cakes named after their resemblance to a folded napkin. Jeremiah filled his withdoces de ovos,a traditional sweet egg cream, but, delicious though they were, I couldn’t help thinking about a folded Victoria sponge napkin filled with cream and jam. So here’s my version, with homemade blackberry and lime jam and a white chocolate cream. If you want to make it easier, fill the sponge napkins with a simple vanilla-whipped cream and store-bought jam of your choice. I won’t judge.Prep10 minChill3 hr+Cook1 hr 45 min, plus coolingMakes12 individual cakesFor the fresh blackberry and lime jam600g blackberries, halved if large200g caster sugarFinely grated zest of 1 lime, plus 2 tbsp juiceFor the white chocolate cream100g white chocolate buttons, or chopped into 1cm pieces, if in a block100ml pure (double) cream, plus 160ml extraFor the sponge cake70ml full-cream milk1tsp vanilla bean paste4 eggs, separated50ml sunflower oil40g plain flour35g cornflour¼tsp fine sea salt¼tsp cream of tartar70g caster sugarTo serveIcing sugar, for dustingTo make the jam, put the blackberries in a medium pan and cook over a low heat for about three minutes, pressing on the fruit as it cooks, until you have a soft pulp. Add the sugar and lime juice, stir until the sugar dissolves, then turn up the heat to medium-high and boil for 20-25 minutes, until the setting point is reached (105C on a sugar thermometer). Off the heat, stir in the lime zest, then leave to cool completely.To make the ganache, put the white chocolate in a medium bowl. Put the cream in a small, heavy-based saucepan on a medium-low heat, cook until just starting to simmer, then pour over the chocolate. Leave to sit for three minutes, so the chocolate softens, then gently stir until the chocolate is melted and fully combined. Cover and refrigerate for about three hours (and for up to three days), until cold.To make the sponge, heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and line the bottom of a large, roughly 40cm × 33cm baking tray with baking paper; do not line or grease the sides.Combine the milk and vanilla bean paste in a small saucepan, bring to a simmer, then set aside and cool to tepid.In a large mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks and oil together, then add the tepid vanilla milk. Whisk to combine, then sift in the flour, cornflour and salt, and fold in.Put the egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on medium-high to soft peaks. Still whisking, drizzle in the sugar a tablespoon at a time, then keep beating for another minute or so, until firm peaks form. Using a large hand whisk, gently fold about a third of the egg white mix into the yolk mix, then fold in the remaining two-thirds. Swap the whisk for a large flexible spatula and gently fold until the egg white mixture is fully incorporated.Scrape the batter evenly into the prepared baking tray, using a palette knife to smooth the surface, then bake for 10–12 minutes, or until the cake bounces back when lightly pressed. Transfer to a rack to cool for about 10 minutes.Run a small knife all around the sides of the cake, then lightly dust the top with some sifted icing sugar. Place a large piece of baking paper on top of the cake, then put a large board on top and flip over to release the cake. Carefully peel away the original sheet of baking paper, which will now be on top, then cut the cake into 12 even 10cm squares.To complete the white chocolate filling, put the chilled white chocolate ganache in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Add the remaining 160ml cream and whip on medium-high until it thickens to soft waves.To assemble, place a spoonful of the white chocolate cream in the centre of each square, top with a spoonful of the jam, then gently fold over the sponge diagonally, so that two points join. To serve, arrange the cakes, slightly overlapping, on a serving plate and dust lightly with icing sugar.These recipes are edited extracts from Baking and the Meaning of Life, by Helen Goh, published by Murdoch Books at £26.
