Experts say it’s common. Here’s what could be going wrongTell us: share your experiences of traveling with friendsJillian PretzelMon 11 Aug 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 14.42 EDTShareIwoke up on the couch feeling nauseous and groggy, with a needle-jabbing-my-temples headache. Was it the flu? Did I eat something bad? There was drool on my cheek, and I glanced at the clock. I remembered checking the time at 1.30 pm; it was now 4pm.I’d accidentally taken anap.Many people say there’s nothing like a good nap – but not me. It always gives me stomach-turning nausea, usually for the rest of the day.So I do my best to avoid dozing, even when I need the rest. In college, I’d power through even if I pulled an all-nighter. But now,as a mom, my no-nap lifestyle is more difficult to maintain. I feel like I’m playing real-life “would you rather”: zombie-tired from staying up all night with my crying baby or spin-cycle sick?Dr Waiz Wasey, a Mayo Clinic-trained sleep physician based in Scottsdale, Arizona, says symptoms such as nausea, dizziness and lightheadedness after a nap are common. These can vary from mild to day-ruining, and could have different causes. Because of this, he says, treatment isn’t one-size-fits-all.Why do I feel sick after a nap?There are several reasons people might experience nausea, dizziness or a generally unwell feeling after a nap.Sleep inertia:Wasey says sleep inertia, characterized by dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea and disorientation, is one of the main reasons people feel sick after taking a snooze.The five kinds of rest – and why they matter for new mothersRead moreSleep cycles typically last about 90 minutes, which includesthree sleep stages plus REM sleep. People usually go through three or four sleep cycles per night, but when nappers wake without completing a full cycle, they may experience unpleasant, often disorienting, symptoms, he says.Most cases of sleep inertia are mild and resolve on their ownafter about 20 minutes, says Dr Funke Afolabi-Brown, a triple-board-certified sleep medicine physician based in Philadelphia. But extreme cases can involve “debilitating symptoms lasting four to six hours, sometimes with vomiting or panic-like symptoms”.Sleep inertia isn’t nap-specific: it can also happen when you wake from a night’s sleep. But this is less common, says Wasey, as someone who has completed a few sleep cycles feels more restored upon waking.Symptoms also tend to be more severe after a nap because of your body’s circadian rhythm, or natural daily sleep cycle. “Your body isn’t expecting to sleep in the afternoon,” Afolabi-Brown says. “Morning grogginess usually resolves within 15-30 minutes, while post-nap symptoms may persist longer.”Wasey notes that people who have sleep apnea,insomniaorsleep deprivationare more likely to experience more extreme symptoms of sleep inertia.Gastrointestinal issues:Acid reflux – also called gastroesophageal reflux or heartburn – is a common cause of nausea, dizziness and chest pain after resting, says Dr Bharat Pothuri, a board-certified gastroenterologist based in Houston, Texas. It is characterized by stomach acid traveling into the esophagus, and lying down after eating makes it worse, says Pothuri.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Just about everyone will experience some acid reflux now and then, Pothuri adds, especially after eating fatty or acidic foods. But some experience more severe symptoms. About20% of the US populationis affected by frequent acid reflux, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (also known as Gerd), and is more likely to experience nausea after lying down.Stomach issues can show up after a full night’s rest, but it’s especially common for daytime snoozers because they may lie down directly after lunch or a snack.Dr Rucha Mehta Shah, a board-certified gastroenterologist in Scottsdale, Arizona, says diet plays a role. “Certain foods like fatty, fried, creamy, dairy or high-fiber foods can sit longer and cause more symptoms,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sleep apnea, a condition where one’s breathing stops and starts abruptly during sleep, can cause symptoms such as headaches, sore throat and even anxiety. “Disruptions in breathing can lead to drops in oxygen levels that can trigger headaches, dizziness, and nausea,” he explains.Less common issues include dysautonomia, the inability to regulate involuntary body functions such as heart rate and blood pressure, andbenign paroxysmal positional vertigo, characterized by dizziness after your head changes positions, such as lying down or sitting up in bed.If you suspect any of these, Wasey says to talk with a doctor.Does the length of a nap matter?A short slumber is a safe bet.“We always encourage naps to be brief: 20 minutes or less,” says Wasey. “If a nap is more than 20 minutes, it can go into deep sleep. If they wake during deep sleep, they’re more likely to experience unpleasant symptoms upon waking.”If a quick lie-down doesn’t seem like enough, give yourself time to complete one full 90-minute sleep cycle. “I tell patients to either do a 20-minute or a 90-minute nap,” he says.If GI issues are causing problems, keep the nap under half an hour, says Pothuri. The digestive system tends to slow down after 20 minutes of sleep, which means food stays in the stomach longer. Plus, less horizontal time means less time for stomach acid to irritate the esophagus.How can you prevent and treat post-nap nausea?Keep naps short, says Wasey – or skip them altogether. It helps to have a good night’s rest, he says: “Start a bedtime routine by winding down, reading a book or meditating, and limit blue light one to two hours before actual bedtime.”Afolabi-Brown says that if you take a nap, doing so earlier in the day can help ensure you don’t have trouble sleeping at night. Snoozing too long or too late in the day can reduce yoursleep drive, the pressure to sleep that builds in our bodies the longer we’re awake.If you suspect GI issues, Shah recommends waiting until your food has digested before lying down – ideally three to four hours. If that’s not realistic, try to avoid spicy, acidic and fatty foods before napping. And when you lie down, prop yourself up with pillows or an adjustable mattress. “We want to work with gravity,” says Shah. “Keeping the head and chest elevated will mean less acid injury to the lower part of the esophagus.”How to sleep well at any age – from babies (and their parents) to dog-tired midlifersRead moreOver-the-counter antacids can alleviate symptoms, but if discomfort persists, Shah recommends seeing a doctor. Prescription medications may provide more relief, or a physician may want to check for other issues in the esophagus, such as infection, ulcers or esophagitis.After speaking with the experts, I set aside a day to try their advice. I kept breakfast and lunch simple, swapping an acidic orange for toast and ignoring lasagne leftovers in favor of a light salad. When my son went down for a nap, I made a mini mountain of pillows to prop myself up and set an alarm for 20 minutes. When I woke up, I felt refreshed, rested and happy – no nausea or brain fog.I don’t always have the forethought to avoid triggering foods or arrange pillows. But thanks to these adjustments, I’ve discovered that there really is nothing like a good nap.Jillian Pretzel is a freelance journalist in Southern CaliforniaExplore more on these topicsWell actuallySleepHealth & wellbeingHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With the arrest of hundreds of protesters in London, for many, the feeling is mutualMon 11 Aug 2025 11.50 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 15.17 EDTShareIn the third month of this tense, parched summer, the British state is under severe strain. Stripped of resources by 14 years of reckless rightwing government, contorting itself to maintain relations with ever more extreme regimes abroad, expanding its security powers at home through ever more tortured logic, regarded by ever more voters with contempt, a once broadly respected institution is increasingly struggling to maintain its authority.You could see the strain on the faces of some of the police officers, reddening with exertion in the sun, asthey arrested 521 peoplein Parliament Square on Saturday for displaying pieces of paper or cardboard with a seven-word message supporting the proscribed group Palestine Action. It was one of the biggest mass arrests in London’s history.The many protesters who refused to be led away had to be lifted off the ground, one by one, without the exercise looking too coercive in front of the cameras. Then their floppy, uncooperative forms had to be carried by clusters of officers through the hostile crowd – to chants of “genocide police!”, “shame on you!” and “fascist scum!” – to a ring of police vans at the square’s perimeter, which were then sometimes obstructed by further protesters, before they eventually drove away.So many officers were needed that some had come from Wales. When Tony Blair’sLabourgovernment introduced Welsh devolution 26 years ago, in times of more harmony and less scarcity, cooperation between the nations was probably not envisaged in this form.On Saturday, so that the capital’s police custody system was not overwhelmed, those arrested were taken to “makeshift outdoor processing centres”, the Observer reported – as if during a general breakdown of law and order. Some of those released on bail then reportedly went back to the protest. “Given the numbers of people arrested,” said the Metropolitan police, “it would have been entirely unrealistic for officers to recognise individuals who returned to [the square].” “Entirely unrealistic” is not a reassuring phrase for those who believe that the government’s approach to Palestine Action is practical and based on sound law.If charged, those arrested will enter the overburdened criminal justice system and then, if found guilty, Britain’s bursting jails. It’s likely that further supporters of Palestine Action will follow. The organiser of Saturday’s protest, Defend Our Juries,has promiseda sustained campaign of “mass, public defiance”, to make the proscription of Palestine Action “unworkable”.This amendment to the 2000 Terrorism Act – a less benign legacy of Blair than devolution – states that anyone who “wears, carries or displays an article” publicly, “in such a way… as to arouse reasonable suspicion that he is a member or supporter of” Palestine Action could be jailed for up to six months; and anyone who “invites support for” the organisation could be jailed for up to 14 years.One woman sat on a camping stool, wearing a panama hat. She told me: ‘I don’t like the Guardian, I read the Telegraph.’Authoritarianism and austerity have risen together in Britain, as the relatively generous public spending of the Blair years has receded and new waves of radical activism have formed over the climate crisis and the destruction of Palestine. Yet the possibility that austerity will make authoritarianism unaffordable, with too much of the government’s funds swallowed up by the security state, does not seem prominent in Labour’s thinking. The fact that Keir Starmer is a former director of public prosecutions and that the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has for many years been one of parliament’s leading authorities on national security, has given them a lot of faith in law-and-order solutions to political problems.The Parliament Square protesters took a different view. They had been advised by Defend Our Juries not to give quotes to journalists, to avoid distracting from the protest’s focus on the Palestine Action proscription and the genocide in Gaza. Yet the dozen protesters I spoke to informally all talked about Britain’s police and politicians without the slightest deference, as part of a system that was failing, practically and ethically, to address our era’s escalating crises.As the arrests went on and on, through the hot afternoon and into the evening, many of the protesters barely moved, but kept facing the same way, sitting on the ground with their placards carefully displayed and their backs to the Houses of Parliament. Partly, this was to provide a globally resonant image, but it was also to dramatise their rejection of the will of the Commons, where only 26 MPs voted against Palestine Action’s proscription last month. Parliament likes to see itself as a historic defender of freedom and liberty, yet when panics about subversive groups are under way, its liberalism often evaporates.While the Commons narrows its views in times of crisis, the electorate sometimes does the opposite. Half of those arrested in the square were aged 60 or older – usually the most politically conservative demographic. Many had had middle-class careers in public service. Chatting among themselves on the grass in the quieter moments between police surges, they could almost have been taking a break between events at a book festival. One woman sat on a camping stool, wearing a panama hat. When I introduced myself, she said: “I don’t like the Guardian, I read the Telegraph.”The last time Labour was in office, opposition to its more draconian and militaristic policies also emerged across the political spectrum. The more rightwing members of this opposition can be questioned: are they as outraged when Tory governments support wars or suspend civil liberties? My sense is not.But either way, broad opposition erodes a government’s legitimacy. At the 2005 election, after the Terrorism Act and the Iraq war, Blair still won, yet with almost a third fewer votes than when he came to power. With Labour more unpopular now, Starmer can less afford to alienate anti-war voters – much as his most illiberal subordinates might want to.Yet any electoral consequences from the scenes in Parliament Square, and from likely sequels, are hardly the only things at stake in the Palestine Action controversy. At mid-afternoon on Saturday, with the police cordon tightening around us, I got talking to two elderly protesters who had watched people being arrested beside them. “I’m in two minds about carrying on with this,” one of them said, opening and closing her piece of cardboard with its illegal message. Defiant earlier, she now seemed frightened. The legally safe space for protest in Britain is shrinking again. Meanwhile in Gaza, there’s no safe space for anything at all.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It feels more like radio phone-in bickering than serious journalismHannah J DaviesMon 11 Aug 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 16.02 EDTShareIn May 2024, the New Yorker published an article with the headline “A British nurse was found guilty of killing seven babies. Did she do it?” Access to the online version of Rachel Aviv’s piece was banned in the UK due to reporting restrictions, with Letby’s retrial on an additional count of attempted murder then imminent. Rules aside, asking whether Letby was in fact innocent also felt taboo at the time, a pursuit for social media conspiracy theorists. Fast forward 15 months, and “did she do it?” is merely par for the course when it comes to the case, with even experts cited by the prosecution apparently unconvinced of Letby’s guilt.This new Panorama comes hot on the heels of an ITV documentary that aired earlier this month,Lucy Letby: Beyond Reasonable Doubt?. That programme focused on holes in the evidence that was presented to the jury who found Letby guilty of killing seven babies and attempting to kill seven more at the Countess of Chester Hospital between 2015 and 2016. Hers had been, said Neena Modi, a professor of neonatal medicine, a “deeply disturbing” trial based on flawed evidence. Claims made in the trial were roundly rubbished by a panel of specialists who reviewed the case, and by experts found by the programme makers, making the evidence sound more like a series of sad anomalies than conclusive proof of wrongdoing by Letby. In any case, one would be unlikely to come away from that programme without at least a measure of doubt about her convictions.And yet, many other doubtsdopersist, leading – one fears – to a continued stream of programmes about the case. This is the third instalment of Panorama that Judith Moritz has made about Letby; the first, released in 2023, was subtitled The Nurse Who Killed, another last year was named Unanswered Questions, and now, in keeping with the rising sense of uncertainty, we have Who to Believe?. Like the ITV documentary, it considers the limitations of the evidence that put the 35-year-old behind bars. Unlike that documentary, though, it also considers whether the alternative version of events put forward by experts such as Modi and Shoo Lee – who rebutted the prosecution’s interpretation of his work on air embolisms – holds water.It is a muddled hour of television, in which Moritz and producer-director Jonathan Coffey (who have alsowritten a book about the casetogether) describe various things as conjecture, before supplying more conjecture of their own, and ultimately concluding that it’s a right old mess. It certainly wouldn’t be right to take the ITV documentary – or any other for that matter – as the ultimate authority on the case. But this Panorama seems to add very little in the way of conclusive information.Take, for example, this lightly heated exchange between Moritz and Coffey, who are discussing whether or not it is significant that the prosecution’s expert witness, Dr Dewi Evans, changed his mind on one of the babies’ cause of death, from air pumped into the stomach to an intravenous air embolism. Moritz: “It’s not like you had a situation where [someone was] saying, this person was shot … actually, no sorry, there’s no gunshot wounds at all, I’ve decided instead they drowned.” Coffey: “Some people would say that’sexactlywhat we’re dealing with here.” Moritz: “It’s certainly a difficult case to get your head around.” Coffey: “Well, some people would say it’snota difficult case to get your head around, that actually they have got their head around it and the prosecution expert evidence is all over the place.” Moritz: “Yeah – and other people would say they got their head around it andconvictedher!” It’s more like a drivetime phone-in than serious investigative journalism.Final Draft review – could you do 3,240 sit-ups then have a lovely old chinwag?Read moreClearly, Moritz and Coffey care about the case, and about finding out whether Letby has indeed been wrongfully convicted. But in an investigation remarkable for the sheer number of theories involved – and now counter-theories – the addition of counter-counter-theories is hard to compute. A long tangent into the death of one child – Baby O – and how he may or may not have sustained injuries to his liver, only underscores the lack of consensus among experts, and the possibility of falling down rabbitholes at every turn. Similarly, inflated insulin levels in Baby F and Baby L lead to wildly different interpretations depending on who is explaining it all. We are told that the immunoassay tests that were used during the trial were highly unreliable, and shouldn’t have been relied on in court. And yet, we also hear that those levels of insulin just cannot be explained away. Unless, of course, the tests were wrong …? And around and around we go.In determinedly not taking any claims at face value, Who to Believe? will surely confuse viewers even more, and brings us no closer to understanding whether there is indeed a compelling alternative to the events set out by the prosecution. It concludes that Letby was either “spectacularly bad” at her job or this was a major miscarriage of justice.

But we’re talking about evenings, really.What about them, exactly?Rachel Higgins, a TikToker in San Diego, came up with the “three-hour night” to make good use of the time she and her husband have between putting their young kids to bed and going to sleep themselves.So they spend evenings picking up plastic while eating cold fish fingers and abandoned crusts, then slump on the sofa staring at their phones, right?That’s precisely what they’re trying to avoid with this nightly routine.OK,go on,let’s hear it.The first hour is “productive time”, when the couple tidy up or do chores, then the second hour, Higgins says, is a phone-free slot “solely dedicated to each other”. That might mean playing games or sharing a shower, she suggests. “Anything that’s gonna get you … talking and connecting.”This already sounds exhausting.The good news is that the third hour is purely for yourself: you can do “anything you want, without judgment”.Even watching videos of menchecking the transmission fluidon theirToyota Aygos?I don’t know what that means, but no judgment.CategorisingOrdnance Survey maps by latitude?No judgment.And this works?When she first posted about it, Higgins called the three-hour night “such a gamechanger” for their relationship.Her advice resurfaced recentlyas part of the latest wave of couples’ hacks for the online age. Because relationships have to compete with shiny rectangles full of rare minerals and distraction – and the phones are winning.Have you heard of phubbing?Is that a sex thing?Quite the opposite: it’s snubbing your partner to look at your phone. It’s bad, too:research this yearfound “strong negative correlations between phubbing and emotional closeness”. People who thought their partners phubbed them regularly “were three times more likely to express disinterest in having children”.That does sound disturbing. What other ideas are there for keeping the spark?TheNew York Times recently suggestedcouples should have more fun together: send silly texts, play games, plan pranks and surprises.I would rather go througha harrowing divorce.Maybe you’re in a BBH relationship.A what?A “boring but happy” one. According to another piece of recent relationship advice, from thetherapist Jean-Claude Chalmet, happy couples relish routine and doing mundane stuff together.Aha! We already do that – and not for three hours, but all the time. Just yesterday we cleaned the dishwasher sprinkler arm together.You guys are truly #couplegoals.Do say:“Hey, let’s not look at our phones tonight, shall we?”Don’t say:“Instead, we can have the blazing row we’ve been scrolling to avoid.”Explore more on these topicsRelationshipsPass notesFamilyMarriagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

AI video generation has surged amid therelease of powerful tools such as Google’s Veo 3and Elon Musk’s Grok Imagine.The channels have millions of subscribers in total, including 1.6 million for the space-stranded infant and 3.9 million forSuper Cat League, which features human-like cats having affairs and, among one of many bizarre scenes, the felines shooting down and dismembering an eagle.Many of these videos qualify as“AI slop”, which refers to low-quality, mass-produced content that is surreal, uncanny or simply grotesque. But some contain a brief, rudimentary plot – in a sign of the growing sophistication of AI-generated content.YouTube has tried to stem the slop deluge byblocking the sharing of advertising revenuewith channels that post repetitive and “inauthentic” content – a policy targeted at AI content.“All content uploaded to YouTube is subject to ourcommunity guidelines– regardless of how it’s generated,” said a spokesperson for YouTube, which is owned by Google’s parent company.After being contacted by the Guardian about the channels – which included channels in the fastest growing list for June – YouTube said it had removed three of them from the platform and blocked a further two from receiving advertising income. It did not specify which channels had been sanctioned.One expert said AI video generators herald the next wave of internet “enshittification”, a term first used by the British-Canadian author Cory Doctorow. Coined in 2022, Doctorow used it to describe the decline in quality of users’ online experiences, as platforms prioritise profit over offering high-quality content.“AI slop is flooding the internet with content that essentially is garbage,” said Dr Akhil Bhardwaj, an associate professor at the University of Bath’s school of management. “Thisenshittificationis ruining online communities on Pinterest, competing for revenue with artists on Spotify and flooding YouTube with poor quality content.”“One way for social media companies to regulate AI slop is to ensure that it cannot be monetised, thus stripping away the incentive for generating it.”Ryan Broderick, the author of the popular Garbage Day newsletter on internet culture, is scathing about the impact of AI video, writing last week that YouTube has become a “dumping ground for disturbing, soulless AI shorts”.Instagram’s Reels video feature is also flooded with AI content. On the platform, a video of variouscelebrities’ headsattached to animal bodies has gained 3.7m views, starring the “Rophant” (Dwayne Johnson and an elephant) and “Emilla” (Eminem on a gorilla).On TikTok, many AI-generated videos have gone viral, including a video ofAbraham Lincoln vlogginghis ill-fated trip to the opera andcats competing in an Olympic diving event. However, the Lincoln and cat Olympic videos are more in the spirit of the internet’s pre-slop era of playful wit.Instagram and TikTok said they require all realistic AI-content to be labelled. Videos suspected to contain AI from these channels were cross-checked with deepfake detection service providerReality Defender.The channels featuring AI videos for July are:Super Cat League(3.9 million subscribers)বজল মিয়া 767k(2 million subscribers – this account has since been closed)LSB POWER GAMING(1.7 million subscribers)Amite Now Here(1.4 million subscribers)Starway(2.8 million subscribers)AmyyRoblox(2.4 million subscribers)Again Raz Vai(1.8 million subscribers)Cuentos Facinantes(4.8 million subscribers)MIRANHAINSANO(4.9 million subscribers)Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingYouTubeDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Every incident is unacceptable,” she said.Rachelle McCarthy, a charge nurse in the east Midlands, said that in her A&E department “even patients you would expect to be placid are becoming irate because of just how long they have to wait”.Once she was punched “square in the face” by “a drunk, 6ft 2in bloke”, she said.In another incident a patient in the waiting room of the A&E where the senior sister Sarah Tappy works in east London punched her in the head, knocking her unconscious. “The violence is awful. And it’s just constant. Nurses. Doctors. Receptionists. None of us feel safe,” she said.A senior A&E nurse in England’s south-west said she had seenviolence against staffin her wards many times, including a patient “pinning a nurse up against a wall” and another colleague being punched by a patient “in the groin and stomach”.The number of attacks on A&E staff at Southmead hospital in Bristol rose from 83 in 2019 to 152 last year. They doubled at Manchester Royal Infirmary from 39 to 79 over the same time period, and increased from 13 to 89 at Maidstone hospital in Kent,NHSfigures given to the RCN showed.Daniel Elkeles, the chief executive of hospitals group NHS Providers, said: “These findings are absolutely shocking.“NHS staff need a safe and respectful environment to look after patients, free from any threat of violence or intimidation, be they in hospital, mental health, community or ambulance settings.“Delays for treatment are frustrating for patients and staff. Every effort is being made to keep these to a minimum.”The union demanded immediate government action to curb the “rising tide of violence”. It wants a reduction in the long waits for patients in A&E, an end to overcrowded hospitals having to use “corridor care” and a solution to the shortages of nurses that are common across the NHS.A separate RCN analysis shows the number of patients who had to wait more than 12 hours in A&E soared twentyfold between 2019 and 2014.Growing numbers of hospitals have hired more security staff, issued clinical staff with stab vests and installed more closed-circuit television.Rebecca Smith, the director of system and social partnership at the NHS Confederation, said the near doubling in attacks exposed by the figures was “deeply worrying”.“No one should have to face violence at work – it is totally unacceptable. These kinds of incidents not only have a huge impact on staff health and wellbeing but also retention of staff as well as NHS services and patient experience.”The RCN sent an freedom of information request to the 129 NHS trusts in England that have at least one emergency department. Of those 89 (69%) replied. However, the true figures will be higher as the union only asked for data relating to the biggest A&E the trust runs.Their figures show a relentless rise in incidents over the six years, from 2,122 in 2019 to 2,297 in 2020, then 2,851 in 2021, 3,120 in 2022, 3,405 in 2023 and finally 4,054 in 2024.NHS Protect issued annual figures for violence, harassment and abuse of NHS staff until it was disbanded in 2016.The most recentNHS staff survey, published in March, found that one in seven workers (14.4%) had suffered physical violence from patients, their relatives or other members of the public in the previous year.Duncan Burton, chief nursing officer for England, said it was “totally unacceptable that NHS staff are facing acts of physical violence from patients and the public while at work”.He added: “NHS staff do an incredible job every day to care for others – and they have the right to come to work without fear of being harmed. We would encourage staff to report all incidents to their employer and for employers to inform the police where appropriate so that perpetrators can be brought to justice.”The health secretary,Wes Streeting, said: “I am appalled by these findings. Nurses dedicate their lives to helping others and deserve to go about their jobs free from violence or intimidation. Anyone who violates this core principle will feel the full force of the law.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthNursingEnglandWes StreetingnewsShareReuse this content"

Seven people were killed in the attack, including theAl Jazeeracorrespondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and the camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa, according to the Qatar-based broadcaster.On Monday, the Guardian visited the site where the journalists were killed. Wadi Abu al-Saud, a Palestinian journalist who was near the tent when the Israeli strike occurred on Sunday, said the attack happened at 11.22pm, just after he had finished filming his latest news bulletin.“I entered the tent opposite theirs, raised my phone to make a call, and then the explosion occurred, Saud said. “A piece of shrapnel hit my phone. I looked back and saw people burning in flames. I tried to extinguish them. Anas and the others had died instantly from the strike.”1:22Al Jazeera's Anas al-Sharif among five journalists killed by Israel in Gaza – videoIn two videos of the aftermath of the strike, Saud can be seen carrying the bodies of those killed. “From now on, I will not continue the coverage,” he said. “I will return to my life as a citizen. The truth has died and the coverage has ended.”The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) admitted carrying out the attack, claiming Sharif was the leader of a Hamas cell responsible for rocket attacks against Israel – an allegation that Al Jazeera and Sharif had previously dismissed as baseless.It was the first time during the war that Israel’s military has swiftly claimed responsibility after a journalist was killed in a strike.Pro-Israel advocates on social media hailed the killing of Sharif and posted photos handed out by the IDF of photos the journalist took with the former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, taken before Hamas’s attack on 7 October.Sara Qudah, theMiddle East and north Africadirector at the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), said: “Israel’s pattern of labelling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom.”In July, Sharif told CPJ that he lived with the “feeling that I could be bombed and martyred at any moment”.Reporters Without Borders condemned the “acknowledged murder by the Israeli army” of Sharif inGazaand called on the international community to intervene.Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said: “We are gravely concerned by the repeated targeting of journalists in Gaza. Reporters covering conflicts are afforded protection under international humanitarian law and journalists must be able to report independently without fear, and Israel must ensure journalists can carry out their work safely.”The UN human rights office condemned the targeting of the journalists’ tent, saying it was “in grave breach of international humanitarian law”.Al Jazeera said the attack was “a desperate attempt to silence voices in anticipation of the occupation of Gaza” and called Sharif “one of Gaza’s bravest journalists”.People gathered at Sheikh Radwan cemetery in the heart of the Gaza Strip to mourn the journalists, whose bodies lay wrapped in white sheets at al-Shifa hospital before their burial. Friends, colleagues and relatives embraced and consoled one another.View image in fullscreenThe funeral procession of Anas al-Sharif, prominent Al Jazeera correspondent and other journalists killed in Israeli airstrike on Gaza.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe area where the attack took place was crowded with media workers on Monday, some speaking to cameras or mobile phones, others taking photos.Islam al-Za’anoun, a news correspondent for Palestine TV and several Arab channels who participated in the funeral, said Sunday’s attack was “a turning point in the world of journalism”.She said: “Despite all the threats he received and the Israeli media’s incitement against him, al-Sharif continued reporting. Now one question haunts me: Who will be next on the list? Will it be me?”Bilal Abu Khalifa, a presenter at Al Jazeera, said he had met Sharif four days ago. “He told me he was in danger,” Abu Khalifa said. “I asked him not to go out or appear publicly too often. He gave me a very simple answer: Bilal, I will not leave Gaza except to the sky! I will not leave Gaza even if I am killed. I know I am on the assassination list, but I will continue to expose the crimes of the Israeli army against my people and show the world, and everyone who stands by them, the truth.”In a final message, which Al Jazeera said had been written on 6 April and which was posted to Sharif’s X account after his death, the reporter said he had “lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification.”‘It was as if I had been poisoned when I left Gaza’: journalist Wael al-Dahdouh on family loss, survival and finding solidarityRead moreHe continued: “Allah may bear witness against those who stayed silent, those who accepted our killing, those who choked our breath, and whose hearts were unmoved by the scattered remains of our children and women, doing nothing to stop the massacre that our people have faced for more than a year and a half.”After the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, Israel barred international journalists from entering Gaza – one of the rare moments when international reporters have been denied access to an active war zone. Since then, the task of documenting the war has fallen heavily on Palestinian journalists, often at the cost of their lives – themselves caught in its devastation, displaced multiple times, their homes reduced to rubble, friends and relatives killed, and at times queueing for food at perilous distribution points.According to Gaza’s government media office, 238 journalists have been killed by Israel since the war started. CPJ said at least 186 journalists had been killed in the Gaza conflict. Israel denies deliberately targeting journalists.In a report released this year, the Watson School of International and Public Affairs’ costs of war project said more journalists had been killed in Gaza than in both world wars, the Vietnam war, the wars in Yugoslavia and the US war in Afghanistan combined.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesAl JazeeraJournalist safetyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Disrupting Israel’s largest weapons manufacturer, Elbit Systems, by trespassing on their sites in Britain is not terrorism. It is the Israeli Defense Forces and all those who arm and enable their war crimes who are the terrorists.”JTAC, agovernment body based within MI5, produced a secret report on 7 March which was disclosed in the high court.While recommending banning Palestine Action, JTAC said the group “primarily uses direct action tactics”, which typically resulted in minor damage to property. “Common tactics include graffiti, petty vandalism, occupation and lock-ons,” it added.Defend Our Juries, which has organised multiple demonstrations, including Saturday’s, in support of Palestine Action, also highlighted Whitehall officials’ description – again in documents revealed in court – of a ban as “relatively novel” as “there was no known precedent of an organisation being proscribed on the basis that it was concerned in terrorism mainly due to its use or threat of action involving serious damage to property”.ADefend Our Juriesspokesperson said: “It is despicable that under political pressure, Yvette Cooper is now actively misleading the British public about the nature of Palestine Action, knowing that if people come to their defence to counter her disinformation, she can have them jailed for 14 years [because they could be deemed to supporting a proscribed group].”The group said many hundreds of people had already committed to the next protest, which is likely to take place in early September and to be on an even larger scale.Uncertainty remains over the status of charges and prosecutions. Tom Franklin, chief executive of the Magistrates’ Association, said: “Based on the information that we currently have, and the statement put out by the MetropolitanPoliceyesterday [Sunday], it could take days and possibly weeks for decisions to be made on whether or not to charge any of those arrested over the weekend. Many of these cases may also be heard in the crown courts, rather than magistrates courts.”Magistrates courts hear less serious cases, although some charges under section 13 of the Terrorism Act are “either way”, meaning the defendant can choose whether to be tried before magistrates or a jury in the crown court.The Defend Our Juries spokesperson said: “Personally I would go to the crown court because I know where the British public is, both on the genocide in Gaza and secondly on the British government’s support for it, and thirdly on people not being allowed to express their opinions.”However, they added that they expected most charges to be laid under section 13, which are all heard in the magistrates courts, as the criminal justice system would not be able to cope with so many jury trials.Explore more on these topicsProtestPalestinian territoriesYvette CooperPoliceIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

In June, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, said heregretted a speechwarning that Britain could become an “island of strangers”.This weekend, Jenrick prompted anger by claiming mass migration was putting at risk women and girls. He repeated the claim that 40% of sexual assaults committed in London last year were carried out by foreign nationals – one of severalassertions about immigration that have been disputed or debunkedin recent days.On Monday, Reform UK claimed migrants from Muslim countries posed a threat to women’s safety in Britain, as the party’s only female MP, Sarah Pochin, claimed asylum seekers arriving on small boats held “medieval views”.The charities’ open letter, sent to the main UK party leaders on Monday, says: “Anti-refugee protests across the country have been distressing to witness, with echoes oflast summer’s riotsmaking them all the more alarming.“The pernicious and insidious currents of racism and hatred underlying these protests are glaring evidence of a failing system. The responsibility to end the divisive politics, racist rhetoric and demonising language of the past is yours. Only then will you bring unity instead of division and cohesion rather than hate.”The letter concludes: “For those who need our compassion to be confronted with further torment here in the UK is shocking. But the outpouring of support from communities condemning the hatred is a powerful reminder that these views do not represent the vast majority. Today we stand in solidarity with those targeted, because this is what represents our country, this is who we are.”Sonya Sceats, the chief executive at Freedom from Torture, said: “No matter who we are or where we come from, we all have the right to feel safe. We know from our clinical work that many men, women and children in these hotels came here seeking protection after being tortured in countries like Afghanistan and Iran.“To meet with hate on the streets of Britain, whipped up by politicians for their own ends, makes survivors feel hunted again and adds to their trauma. This isn’t who we are as a country.“It is down to the millions of us who want a more compassionate approach to stand together with refugees and for an end to the torture and repression which drives people across borders in the first place.”Jo Benefield, the volunteer campaign coordinator for Bristol Defend the Asylum Seekers Campaign, was one of many signatories who took part in counter-gatherings across the country.In Bristol on Saturday, estimates suggest the protesters were outnumbered by eight to one, with about 50 in the anti-refugee group compared with about 400 people standing in solidarity with refugees.She said: “In the riots of last summer it was counter-protesters who protected residents in another Bristol hotel before police arrived. So the people staying in the hotel being targeted this year were pleased to know so many of the local community were there to support them.”Tim Naor Hilton, the chief executive of Refugee Action, said: “The vicious and relentless attacks on people seeking asylum from some politicians and sections of the media using age-old racist tropes and shoddy data must stop now. We must build on the huge swathes of support for refugees that has spilled out onto the streets and create truly resilient and welcoming communities.”Together WithRefugees, the largest pro-refugee coalition in UK history, with more than 600 member organisations, is calling for a plan that upholds the UK’s commitment under international law to the right to claim asylum, provides a proper strategy for welcoming refugees, and forges stronger global cooperation to tackle the root causes that force people to flee their homes.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumProtestFar rightRaceNigel FarageRobert JenrickRefugeesnewsShareReuse this content"

TheWall Street Journalreported on Sunday that former White House adviser and rightwing provocateur Steve Bannon had advocated for Antoni’s nomination.In a statement on X, labor secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said Antoni would “provide the American people with fair and accurate economic data they can rely on”.The president’s shock firing of McEntarfer alarmed economists and statisticians – as well as some senior Republican lawmakers –who feared the move would undermine the credibility of the agency’s economic data – long seen as a gold standard.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

A spokesperson said at the weekend that the duke was consideringsetting up a new charitable organisationworking “in the same space in the region”.There is also “active development” on other Archewell projects with Netflix, which “span a variety of content genres”, including a feature adaptation of the bestselling romantic novel Meet Me At The Lake, by Carley Fortune.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It quoted witnesses who claimed to have seen the man stumbling in a “paralytic” state.At 2.30am he reportedly removed all his clothes and walked into the reception area, before moving to the gym and spa.The man had been due to fly passengers to Gatwick from Cape Verde last Wednesday. After the incident in the hotel, he was grounded by the airline and a replacement pilot was called up.An easyJet source told the Sun: “Anyone who saw the pilot cavorting naked in the early hours on the day before a flight would not dream of getting on a plane with him at the controls.”An easyJet spokesperson said: “As soon as we were made aware, the pilot was immediately stood down from duty, in line with our procedures, pending an investigation. The safety of our passengers and crew is easyJet’s highest priority.”EasyJet’s flights from Gatwick to Cape Verde are its longest from England, at 2,332 nautical miles, with the journey taking about six hours.Explore more on these topicsUK newsCape VerdeeasyJetAirline industryAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

The most recent was the 28-year-old Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif,killed on Sunday in his makeshift newsroom outside a hospital, along with four colleagues.Press freedom groups and journalists say those killings are part of a campaign of intimidation to shut down vital reporting, which Israel has justified internationally with smears and false claims that the targets were undercover Hamas fighters.With international reporters barred from independent reporting in Gaza – a handful have been allowed in under Israeli military escort, but they are not allowed to move freely or speak to Palestinians – the work done by journalists in Gaza is critical.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I have no doubt that the prevention of international access, the killings of journalists, the targeting of media facilities, the punishment of [Israeli] outlets like Haaretz is part of a deliberate strategy on the part of Israel to conceal what is happening inside Gaza,” said the CPJ chief executive, Jodie Ginsberg.She pointed to a recent incident when a BBC crew reported from a Jordanian military plane dropping humanitarian aid into Gaza – but wasbarred by Israel from filming the devastation below.“We had the example of the international news crews being allowed to film the airdrops but not the devastation when the doors opened.”In July, Sharif, one of the most prominent journalists still working in Gaza, went viral on social media when he broke down on air covering starvation. Passersby urged him to keep going because he gave Gaza a voice.Soon after, an Israeli military spokesperson revived allegations – first aired in 2024 – that he was a militant, including accusing him of faking mass hunger in a “false Hamas campaign on starvation”.The CPJ issued astark warningthat those Israeli claims were a death threat.“These latest unfounded accusations represent an effort to manufacture consent to kill Sharif,” CPJ regional director Sara Qudah said at the time. “This is not the first time Sharif has been targeted by the Israeli military, but the danger to his life is now acute.”Sharif had also anticipated his own death and described it as retaliation for his reporting in a statement released on social media. “If these words reach you, know that Israel has succeeded in killing me and silencing my voice,” he wrote.Israel has published a dossier of documents it says were recovered from Gaza and link Sharif to Hamas. They end in 2021, two years before the war began, and do not even attempt to address his regular appearances live on camera.A role as one of the most prominent journalists in one of the most closely surveilled places on Earth would be strikingly difficult to combine with command of a Hamas unit during an all-out war.Documents Israel published after killing another Al Jazeera journalist last yearclaimedIsmail al-Ghoul was given a military rank when he was 10 years old.While they marshalled contradictory and unconvincing evidence, the existence of those files reflected Israeli concerns about pressure from western allies, and the need for at least the appearance of compliance with international law.Despite international pressure, Israel has not offered any explanation for the deaths of Sharif’s four colleagues, protected civilians killed in their workplace. Ginsberg said she feared that was a warning that already unimaginable risks had escalated further.“What’s astonishing to me is they’ve not even attempted to justify the other killings,” she said. “So they’re admitting to murdering those journalists, knowing they were journalists.“I think this is deliberately intended to have a chilling effect to show that Israel can do what it likes, and nobody will take any action.“If we are now at a stage where Israel can so brazenly target an entire news crew, what does that mean for the safety of any of the other journalists who are operating there. Who is next?”French historian Jean-Pierre Filiu, given rare permission to enter Gaza for academic research during the conflict, said a month researching there had also convinced him that Israel is trying to silence reporting from Gaza.“Now I understand why Israel is denying the international press access to such an appalling scene,” hesaidin an interview with Haaretz after the trip.“Even though I have been in a number of war zones in the past, from Ukraine to Afghanistan, via Syria, Iraq and Somalia, I have never, but never, experienced anything like this.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaJournalist safetyanalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s because it’s the fastest way to silence dissent and to accelerate their agenda. And I want to be clear, this is not about crime. This is about what Trump is trying to do to DC in order to take over DC and silence us.”Lamont Mitchell was not so sure. A lifelong Washingtonian who resides among the poorer and more crime-stricken neighborhoods east of the Anacostia river, he regarded Trump’s plans for the homeless as “inhumane”, but was open to his ideas for making the city’s streets safer. Mitchell described how he avoids certain areas on his drive home for fear of being struck by a stray bullet, no longer walks down certain blocks, had his RV stolen and plans to buy a gun.“As a senior in Washington, I need to feel safe,” said 69-year-old Mitchell, who chairs the Anacostia Coordinating Council community organization. “We gotta take drastic action when drastic action is called for.”The overwhelmingly Democratic federal district is the latest American city to which Trump has deployed troops since taking office, after sending active-duty marines and national guard into Los Angeles in June to quell protests over immigration enforcement. This time, the foe is crime that the president argues is “out of control”, and the catalyst is the attack of a staffer from the “department of government efficiency” in a relatively safe neighborhood earlier this month.Mayor Muriel Bowser has called Trump’s intervention “unsettling and unprecedented”, as well as unwarranted. City leaders have pointed to statistics that show crimes such as robbery, homicide and assault with a deadly weapon are down, and violent crime hit a 30-year low in 2024.Yet Washington continues to struggle with rates of violent crime that are higher than cities with similar populations, according to the Real-Time Crime Index from AH Datalytics. Residents are used to hearing reports of violence, though much of it occurs in the city’s poorer, majority Black eastern third, far from the museums and monuments of the National Mall.They are also used to seeing a lot of police – about 50 law enforcement agencies are already in Washington DC, ranging from the citywide Metropolitan police department (MPD) to the obscure zoo police, FBI police and Federal Reserve police, which provide security around specific agencies.National guard troops and agents from the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) are now expected to be on the streets along those officers, but residents are unsure whether they will make much difference.“I tend to be pretty cynical about what the Trump administration is doing right now. This seems pretty clearly just like red meat to throw to his base, this announcement on a Monday,” said Brian Strege, a neighborhood commissioner in Navy Yard, where groups of young people have appeared repeatedly over the summer, shooting off fireworks and harassing bystanders.“I get the sense it’s just going to be a lot of bored national guard troops wandering around the city.”Trump made mention of the disturbances in Navy Yard during his White House press conference, but Strege said the city had already taken steps to stop the disorder, including by instituting a night-time curfew this summer for people under 18. Trump plans to take over the police department for 30 days – right around the time schools resume, and Strege said the teenagers typically stop showing up.View image in fullscreenTrump at the White House on Monday.Photograph: Zuma/Avalon“Thirty days from now is going to be September. Our juvenile crime is likely to decrease, because it always does. So, it sounds like they’re going to pretend that it went down because they did this big deployment,” he said. “I don’t see it helping really at all. I think our police force has actually been doing a pretty good job over the past few years.”Last Saturday night saw more teenagers flood Navy Yard, as well as a shooting. The following day, Edward Daniels, another neighborhood commissioner in the area, saw Ice agents patrolling the street, and at one point stopping some teenagers from riding bikes, which others had used in the past to harass people.Their presence, he said, didn’t make him feel safe, but rather concerned – did these agents know how to patrol a city? Were they coordinating with the police department?“It’s going to make things even more chaotic here and cause what I believe to be even more dangerous situations than what we’ve seen here on the ground,” he said.Across the Anacostia river, Sandra Seegars, a longtime anti-crime activist, welcomed Trump’s announcement. Her Congress Heights neighborhood has one of the highest homicide rates in the city, according to police data, and she was pleased to hear from a friend that federal agents had been spotted in a nearby park.“He’s going to make me feel safer,” Seegars said of Trump’s deployment. “I think he’s doing the right thing. He should have done it before now.”Explore more on these topicsWashington DCUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

As she scrolled through Instagram looking at festive songs, a stream of messages from old school friends started coming into her phone. Look at the news, they told her.Media outlets across east Asia were reporting that Cheung, who had just finished her A-levels, had been declared a threat to national security by officials inHong Kong. There was an offer of HK$1m (£94,000) to anyone who could assist in her arrest or capture.Friends said: ‘Sorry, you are a criminal in Hong Kong now so we can’t be associated with you.’ Even friends in Leeds stopped seeing meNews reports included a photograph of her aged 11, seemingly the only picture officials had of her before she and her family left to resettle in the UK in 2020. “I couldn’t even really recognise myself,” she says.Cheung says she was still in a state of shock as friends started jokingly congratulating her on her infamy. After finishing school, she had been working as a communications assistant for a campaign group in the UK that advocates for democracy in Hong Kong.She could barely believe that Chinese officials would care about a teenager living thousands of miles away. Yet, as friends started unfollowing her on social media, the life-changing consequences of what had just happened became clear.View image in fullscreenChloe Cheung’s arrest warrant with a photograph of her aged 11. ‘I couldn’t even really recognise myself,’ she says.Photograph: Handout“They were saying ‘sorry, but you are a criminal in Hong Kong now so we can’t be associated with you.’ Even friends here in Leeds said they would have to stop seeing me as they wanted to be able to go back to Hong Kong,” she says.Cheung had dreamed of a gap year travelling the world and visiting friends in Hong Kong. Neither was possible now, after Chinese officials vowed to “pursue for life” Cheung and others they accuse of promoting democracy. Beijing has a history oftargeting critics in exileand pressuring countries to detain and deport them.“The bounty will follow me for ever. It’s a form of psychological warfare – telling the world that dissent has no safe haven. Even if you were just a teenager when you spoke out, you’re not safe,” says Cheung.View image in fullscreenChloe Cheung, left, co-founder of the group Hong Kongers in Leeds, protesting against plans for a Chinese ‘super embassy’ in London.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBut if China’s aim was to dissuade her from taking a public stance on Hong Kong or criticising it, it has not worked. Cheung says she has no intention of staying quiet.Growing up in Hong Kong, Cheung says she always felt patriotic and used to “love running home for the flag-raising ceremony that happened on TV at 6.30pm”. But that all changed in 2019-20 whenmillions of people took to the streets of Hong Kong.The demonstrators were protesting against the increasingly autocratic authority of Beijing and the control it wanted to exert over the former British territory, which since 1997 has been classified as a “special administrative region” – part of Chinese territory but governed under separate rules and laws to the mainland.Quick GuideTransnational repressionShowTransnational repression is the state-led targeting of refugees, dissidents and ordinary citizens living in exile. It involves the use of electronic surveillance, physical assault, intimidation and threats against family members to silence criticism. The Guardian’s Rights and freedom series ispublishing a series of articlesto highlight the dangers faced by citizens in countries including the UK.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Until then, Hong Kong had been allowed a degree of autonomy from mainland China, including a partially democratically elected executive and an independent media.From 2020, after severalyears of pro-democracy protests known as the “umbrella revolution”, Beijing began to impose closer control over the territory, including changing election laws so that only pro-Beijing “patriots” could run for office,and introducing extradition powers allowing it to transfer fugitives to the mainland.The constitutional principle of “one country, two systems”, agreed with the British before the handover in 1997, was abandoned, with Hong Kong’spro-democracy parties later disbandingas the possibility of peaceful political change receded.View image in fullscreenChloe Cheung and her family moved to the UK when she was 15 years old as her parents feared she would end up in prison for speaking out.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“At the time I attended my first protest [in 2019], I was expecting it to be completely peaceful because I was taught at school that we have freedom of speech and press in Hong Kong,” Cheung recalls.“Then suddenly, the police started shooting teargas and rubber bullets at us and started arresting people really violently; dragging protesters and standing on their necks. I was just 14 and my worldview completely changed.“I realised whatever we had been learning in school was a lie,” she says. “I’d been brainwashed.

Although her parents were not political, Cheung says they could see that it was better for her and her younger brother’s future to move to the UK.Her family, says Cheung, “knew I was someone who doesn’t know how to shut up. They didn’t want either of us to end up in prison for speaking our mind, because my mum said, ‘You are kind of nobody. No one would know that you’re in prison.’”The family arrived in Leeds in 2020, where Cheung, then 15, threw herself into studying for her GCSEs. With the UK going through Covid lockdowns, she spent most of her time at home catching up on the syllabus and practising past exam papers. After a successful first year, she went on to study maths, further maths and economics for A-level.Her first taste of activism outside Hong Kong came at 18 after she made a submission to the UN on the experiences of women during the 2019-20 protests in the city. She was later invited to the UN office in Geneva to join an NGO meeting on the topic. It was here that she met members of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong, which advocates for democracy.View image in fullscreenFrom 2020, Beijing imposed tighter control over Hong Kong, changing election laws and allowing extradition to the mainland.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“At that point I knew I could not afford to go to university yet [as she would have to pay the higher overseas tuition fees] so asked the committee if I could take a job working for them,” she says.“I didn’t imagine it would be a career and when I was hired it was just on a short-term contract, more or less as an intern,” says Cheung. “I was happy just to save up money.”She soon began taking on a more public role at the committee, speaking to MPs and journalists while using her real name. She thinks it was this that irked Chinese officials.It was because a UK police officer broke diplomatic protocol and stepped into the consulate to save him that something worse didn’t happen“I spoke with a lot of media and my quotes were used as someone who was born and grew up in Hong Kong and so with a personal connection. The authorities saw that and intentionally want to target people who have got a profile.”After the bounty and warrant for her arrest were announced, Cheung says she did consider taking herself out of the public spotlight. “But I thought if I do this now everyone will know it is because I am scared and giving up,” she says.“They [China] want to stop others from speaking out publicly, but I know I am fortunate to have my family here in the UK.”View image in fullscreenChloe Cheung outside Morley town hall in Leeds. Her family moved to the city when they left Hong Kong in 2020, when she was 15.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianHowever, it has not been easy. Cheung has faced an onslaught of sexual harassment and abuse via social media and was followed by two “suspicious-looking” Chinese men to a restaurant after an event. She reported the incident to the police.She has had to change her address and is now cautious about meeting new people. In 2022, a pro-democracy protester demonstrating on the pavement wasdragged into China’s consulatein Manchester before being beaten up in a “barbaric” attack.“It was certainly because a UK police officer broke diplomatic protocol and stepped into the grounds of the consulate to save him that something worse didn’t happen to that protester,” she says.‘We don’t feel safe here’: Hongkongers in UK fear long reach of Chinese governmentRead more“He could have disappeared. It’s just a matter of time before someone is kidnapped or killed, given how much China is escalating their overseas repression.”Aside from her personal safety, Cheung realises her public profile is now limiting her future choices in life. “I have shut off a lot of job opportunities with any company that has business ties or trade with China.

But never the tricksy comedian Luke McQueen. So this show opens with a real (or is it?) phone call to Goldsmith, during which McQueen demands to know why he’s never been on the podcast. The answer is of little consequence. McQueen has a sample of Goldsmith’s voice so he can create a compliant AI version of the podcast host and record his own episode live on stage.McQueen’s past work on stage and TV has delighted in playing with the truth. He pretended to be thescorned former double-act partner of Jack Whitehall, lured audiences into a show on the false promise that Frankie Boyle would be there, and publicly debased himself to win back a fictional girlfriend.His persona, simultaneously high-status and desperate for approval, returns in Comedian’s Comedian, while McQueen explores AI, ambition and the nature of artistic vulnerability in deliciously fresh ways.‘TikTok is like an old-school variety show’: what’s behind the surprising boom in ventriloquism?Read moreThe conceit is that he wants this interview to showcase him as a “misunderstood artist”, but his AI interviewer has other ideas, and undermines him with questions about his lack of fame, family and driving licence. There is tension between the pressure for comedians to bare their souls to achieve success, and McQueen’s conviction that true bravery means taking risks that might not pay off. And it’s all cut through with enjoyably grotesque jokes about McQueen’s online activities, a memorable segment featuring alter ego Professor Franklin, and an uncomfortable encounter with McQueen’s teenage self.There’s a heady mix of introspection and mischief as McQueen pulls the rug multiple times, teasing that we might finally get to see behind the metaphorical (and at one point, literal) mask.

Especially for the not insignificant number of clubs flogging shirts for £85+ a pop. As sport and fashion become ever more intertwined – Jack Grealish as an ambassador for Gucci; SonHeung-min for Burberry; Kalvin Phillips inthose massive Loewe boots– mainstream football’s interest with clothes has moved on from justDavid Beckham in a sarong. It is a state of affairs thatformer catwalk modelPep Guardiola no doubt appreciates.And, after a couple of years of subpar kit designs – running the gamut from insipid to truly horrifying – the 2025-26 Premier League season has upped its sartorial game. All-black away strips and turquoise touches have proved popular; while manufacturers still insist on “taking inspiration” from home stadium architecture and surroundings. (The success of this varies immensely; but Everton, Leeds, and Burnley have all nailed it this time around.) No brand has let the side(s) down, but the Adidas designers have done especially well with a series of understated new strips, all based on their“Total 90” template. The smaller labels have also impressed. And it is pleasing to see the three returnees dressed up for the occasion.2025-26is due to be the final seasonthat betting companies are allowed to serve as front-of-shirt sponsors, but judging by the number still present they will have to be dragged from the pitch kicking and screaming. Here are all the looks – taking in sand, sky, and sea – to soon emerge from the tunnel.ArsenalView image in fullscreenArsenal go gothic.Photograph: Adidas/Arsenal FCThe Gunners launched their new home strip on a heavily vignetted, blood-redlanding page, complete with anatomical heart beating on the screen; an incongruously dark vibe until you consider that Mikel Arteta does indeed havesomething of the nightabout him. A subtle repeating motif on the shirt is a similarly eldritch, gothicA(a nod to the typeface used for the club’s 1949-50 “Victoria Concordia Crescit”crest), offset by a crisp white collar and sleeve. Said sleeve is still urging us toVisit Rwanda.Theawaykit is also good: a royal blue lightning bolt-ish pattern that harks back to themid-90s’ on-the-road design, and only mildly – unintentionally – reminds one of the Victoria line moquette. The beautiful, art deco-influencedthird kitin cream and burgundy features the Adidastrefoil logo, AKA the one that looks like the top half of a ganja leaf. Apart from that, you would be happy to take it home to your mum.Do not ask me why Arsenal needfivegoalkeeper shirts, but you will find David Raya in any of the following (deep breath):green; a slightly darker green;yellow and red; yellow and black; purple.Aston VillaView image in fullscreenAston Villa’s new home look.Photograph: Adidas/Aston Villa FCThe sleeve of Villa’s Adidas home strip ostensibly “pays homage” to the club stadium. This seems to be a common – but too often shoddily executed – theme this year. But the Villans’ top actually does reference Villa Park in a way that is recognisable; the cuff features the same intricate gold design that adorns theHolte End facade. The main shirt colour way is the classic claret and blue; the shorts are white. The socks feature a gold “AV” monogram.Theaway fitis a mostly black design with grey raglan sleeve. It is OK, I guess; but it does slightly remind one of when the printer runs out of colour ink. Unlike thethird kit, which is basically what would happen if a toddler was let loose with purple and blue finger-paints. A joy.As for the home goalkeeper jersey: you know when the doctor asks what colour phlegm you are bringing up, in case you have pneumonia? Usually indicated by an intense green? Well, it isnot looking goodfor Emi Martínez (or his potential replacement) …BournemouthView image in fullscreenThe Cherries’ and their rippled sand-effect strip.Photograph: Umbro/Bournemouth FCThere is no more awkward sponsor logo than the “bj88” slapped on the front of the Cherries’ shirts. It is difficult to see past such misfortune to assess the Umbro-made kit itself, but suffice to say it consists of black and red vertical stripes. In a hint at the club’s beachside location, there is a delightful “rippled sand” effect within the stripes. (And, for anyone fancying their chances with a metal detector along the coastline, the collar and cuff boast a gold trim.)Theaway stripis a throwback to the blue and black epoch – the Cherries if you’d packed them at the bottom of the shopping bag – with the crest and Umbro logo embroidered. Which is as it should be: I do not want to tell you how manyTPUbadges I have lost to bathroom radiators. Thethird kitis pastel pink. Thehome goalkeeper kitis a luminous green; theawaya bright purple.BrentfordView image in fullscreenBrentford’s new signing? Joma.Photograph: Joma/Brentford FCThomas Frank’s departureis not the only change for the Bees this year: their kit supplier, formerly Umbro, is now Joma. The Spanish brand has done well (what do you mean you have never heard of them? Do you not watch tennis players who rank in the low-tens?) The kit celebrates the centenary of the traditional red-and-white colour scheme with a breezy “100” signoff on the back of the collar (although it is giving “ran out of space at the bottom of the page” so the handwriting starts to slide into the margin).In keeping with the anniversary celebrations, the design echoes the 1925 strip; broad stripes with pinstripe edging. The collar is a modern take on the classic lace-up. Now, I do not know if there is a job-share situation going on at Joma, but while the home strip slaps, the away one is … well. The players will be running out in what I can only describe as asoil-brown monstrosity. (Maybe it is a literal grower.) The goalie outfit, meanwhile, is a bright pink number. Thethird kitis a little meh; a pale blue, salmon, and burgundy – hues borrowed from the club’s pre-red ‘n’ white era.BrightonView image in fullscreenBrighton’s new home kit, with a turquoise touch.Photograph: Nike/Brighton & Hove Albion FCBrighton’s new home strip is the first ever to feature the colour of “Hyper Turq”. This is because “Hyper Turq” is a colour Nike has made up. As the name suggests, it is turquoise. It is a nice touch (including on the Nike swoosh and underarm panels) on what can – apologies – historically be a pretty dull blue-and-white affair. PlusHyper Turqturquoise is the colour of Brighton’s seafront railings. The smart v-shaped collar bears the quote: “WE ARE BRIGHTON”.The round-neckedaway kitis a lilac and mauve mix. Interestingly, both the Nike swoosh and crest are centrally aligned, which makes for a pleasingly streamlined aesthetic. In a rare example of club owners not trying to squeeze every last penny from loyal supporters, Brighton tend to repurpose the previous season’s away kit as the next third kit, which, at present, looks to be the case again (despite an earlier statementsaying otherwise). The threekeeper kitsare in yellow, orange, and black. Nike did their best work this season in the “city by the sea” (embroidered on the back).BurnleyView image in fullscreenCastore’s classy new Burnley kit.Photograph: Burnley’s new home kit from press release/Castore/Burnley FCWelcome back, lads. It is good to see you – especially because Castore has created some lovely new fits. The home shirt is in the traditional claret and features an ultra-fine topographical pattern representing the contours of Lancashire’s countryside and the heights of the Pennines. This actually works, unlike when manufactures “take inspiration” from something and then just whack on a standard, or unidentifiable, motif.Theaway shirtis sky blue and has a decoration resembling cirrus clouds (those are the streaky ones; yes, I did pay attention in GCSE geography – ask me about onion skin weathering, I beg you. Anyone) – although apparently they are meant to be sound waves. All in all it is a very soothing kit, as opposed to the multiple vibrant keeper strips, which strongly suggest attendance at theHoli festival. The third kit will be a much more hangover-friendlyblack with gold trim.ChelseaView image in fullscreenChelsea’s cool new shirt, again featuring no sponsor.Photograph: Nike/Chelsea FCDolly Parton oncedescribedher style as “costing a lot of money to look this cheap”; and it has to be said that the wealthier legacy clubs often seem to follow the same mantra. But Chelsea, celebrating their 120th anniversary, have scrubbed up well – if a little blandly – for the new season. Nike’s marketing spiel is that the jersey’s (extremely) subtle pattern “embodies the youthful spirit that has shaped west London”.Reggie Walsh– the club’s current 16-year-old squad member – will be pleased. They also managed to getSuggsin the promo video. Madness.The kit is the usual heritage colour of dark blue, but has red and white underarm inserts in a modern twist. The shirt will also boast a goldClub World Cupwinners’ badge. As in recent seasons, a front-of-shirt sponsor is absent. The club isholding outfor a lucrative long-term deal – although not signing a short one in the meantime does not seem to make a massive amount of business sense, IMHO. Shirts do look so much better without giant, garish logos though – especially when the logos are those of gambling companies. The home keeper shirt comes inblack, and the away is green.The outfield away strip is much more interesting. Officially in the colours of “Phantom” (that’s white to you and me), and “Galactic Jade” (otherwise known as green) and red (red), the design is a nod to the club’s 1974-75 Magnificent Magyars-eraaway look. There are also some centralised pinstripes to add flair. The third kit is yet to be released, but is rumoured to feature the1990s club crest.Crystal PalaceView image in fullscreenThe reigning FA Cup winners’ new home strip.Photograph: Macron/Crystal Palace FCThe Italian brand Macron is again producing the Eagles’ fits. The home, of course, features the classic red-and-blue vertical stripes, but this time the stripes include white bands in between them for a refined feel. The cuffs are also white – as are the sleek shoulder panels. It is a classy kit; far nicer thanlast season’s “experimental” effortwhich looked for all the world like an 80s pub carpet. Thekeeper kitis a light green.The away kit, complete with Mandarin collar, is abold, gold affairto celebrate the club’s jubilant2025 FA Cup win. The PR people are calling it the “Golden Eagle” kit, which is a pun I can 100% get behind. No update, at the time of writing, on the third look.EvertonView image in fullscreenAnother successful kit from Castore.Photograph: Castore/Everton FCDespite the Toffees finishing unexpectedly rather well last season (given the inauspicious start, anyway); being reunited with beloved manager David Moyes; and moving into a brand new stadium, the club hasstruggled to securequality additions during the transfer window. But should they materialise, the new signings will have the privilege of wearing an attractive and intelligent Castore strip.Both the body and sleeve of the home shirt – in a familiar Everton blue – feature a prominent wave pattern to represent the River Mersey and the club’s new waterfront ground. The socks, paired with white shorts, showcase the silhouette of local landmark,Prince Rupert’s Tower(also an integral part of the club crest).Theaway stripis a pale yellow for shirt and socks, with blue shorts. The cuff features a design that mirrors the railway line which used to serve Liverpool’s docklands. The third kit is rumoured to have a black base and Prince Rupert’s Tower on the chest instead of the club’s full badge. Meanwhile, Jordan Pickford will either be in a green jacquard number (home) or black (away).FulhamView image in fullscreenFulham’s ‘clean and contemporary’ new strip.Photograph: Adidas/Fulham FCFulham have announced their “clean and contemporary” 2025-26 home strip; and clean and contemporary is an accurate description of the v-necked, zero-red, all-white fit (with piping, Adidas logo, and the brand’s famous stripes on the shoulder all in black). The aesthetically agreeable home jersey also features arubber emblemof Craven Cottagebalcony’s wrought ironwork. Compensating for the white-domination of the outfield look, the keeper will wearall red with metallic detail.The away strip is also a looker, and heavily reminiscent of the club’s 1999-20lime green awaythreads. It shows off an oversized retro collar and the club crest of the same era. Back in the day the club sponsor was an internet service provider calledDemon Internet; a company which no longer exists, but turns out had a very prophetic name. No news yet on the third kit.Leeds UnitedView image in fullscreenLeeds’s new kit, with mosaic-patterned detail.Photograph: Adidas/Leeds United FCThe Leeds Adidas-made home kit stays traditional with the main colourway of white, blue, and yellow. But, consistent with a popular concept in kit design this year, there is a cute pattern inspired by the mosaic tile of the Lowfields Tunnel – the route Whites fans often take to Elland Road – which adds pizzaz to what is otherwise a simple but gratifyingly polished, attractive look for the club’s return to the top tier.Theaway stripis predominantly blue with multiple yellow touches, including an all-yellow twist on sponsor Red Bull’s logo. The goalkeeper kits are in a lighter blue (home) and orange (away), as well asdeep purple. Thethird kitis a few alcopops down; a dizzying, chaotic mishmash of the traditional three colours. But I rather like it; it is everything but dull.LiverpoolView image in fullscreenLiverpool and Adidas return as a match made in heaven.Photograph: Adidas/Liverpool FCLiverpool start their season dealing with a maelstrom of emotions. There is the triumph of last season’s title win and plenty of exciting new faces – Florian WirtzandJeremie Frimpongamong them.But there is tragedy too: thedeath of Diego Jota, as well asthe incidentat the title parade that left scores of fans injured.Joining Wirtz et al is another addition to the club: Adidas. The brand has signed a10-year dealwith the club after Liverpool ended their five-year Nike stint. And a brand responsible for some of the club’s most iconic strips has hit the ground running: the home outfit is an all-red affair (officially “Strawberry Red”) with a white crewneck collar and cuff. The simplifiedLiver Bird emblemremains instead of the full crest (which personally I wish would make a comeback …)The away effort is also beautiful: an off-white jersey complemented by red and dark green accents. The shirt is paired with a choice of either a black short and white sock, or the reverse. Meanwhile, thethird kitis a mint green, which calls to mind theearly 90s awaydrip.Manchester CityView image in fullscreenManchester City’s sleek new home kit complete with sash.Photograph: Puma/Manchester City FCWell done to Puma, who have designed a lovely home uniform here. It is the standard sky blue (with navy blue accents), but a sash features for the first time on a City home shirt (it has been a frequent away design element). The collar shade is the same as the body, creating a clean, smooth aesthetic.Theaway kitis an all-black number referencing the club’s earliest known strip. Either that or they are going through their Johnny Cash era/a severe depression. It is dashing, though, and if one were to attempt to enter a Michelin-starred restaurant in a footie top, this is the one I would probably go for (see also: a funeral). Thethird kitis causing quite the reaction online – none of it good. The neon green accents are proving especially unpopular, but for my money* the raindrops-inspired main design on a drizzly-grey jersey for a club located in the soggy north-west is a stroke of genius.LS Lowry would be proud. Thegoalie kitsare available in many loud colourways, including fuchsia.*But not literally because YNWA.Manchester UnitedView image in fullscreenUnited they stand …?Photograph: Adidas/Manchester United/Adidas/Manchester United FCThe Red Devils have been promoting their new home strip with the strapline: “United, wherever we go.” Bold, given that the club has five playershankering for a move, all of whom are only allowed to train at Carrington after the rest of the squad has gone home.The Adidas kit ostensibly pays homage to Old Trafford – a slightly odd decision now that Jim Ratcliffe hasannouncedthe 115-year-old stadium is to be replaced with a Norman Foster-designed behemoth (currently assigned the Ronseal-esque name of “New Trafford”). The back of the collar reads “Theatre of Dreams” – if the dream is to finish 15th – while the sleeve incorporates an “abstract” pattern referencing the stadium. After close inspection, I can report that this is a very, very abstract reference indeed.Theaway kitis white with plum accents and a lavender snowflake motif inspired by the1990-92 strip. The colour scheme brings to mind the Jenny Josephcouplet: “When I am old / I shall wear purple”; just a thought in case the 40-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo fancies a hat-trick of United stretches. The third kit is the best of the three; a black and yellow strip reminiscent of the1993-94 away kit.Newcastle UnitedView image in fullscreenNewcastle’s new home kit featuring Shepherd’s plaid.Photograph: Adidas/Newcastle United FCDespite the Magpies’ extremely feelgoodCarabao Cup winlast season – marking a first domestic triumph in 70 years for this storied and well-loved club – it still pains me somewhat to compliment a team majority-owned by a regime whose greatest hits includedismemberment by bone-saw.But kit manufacturer Adidas continues its (for the most part) good summer run here. Clubs with traditional monochrome colours can sometimes struggle to distinguish themselves, but Adidas has introduced a serrated edge to those classic, thick black stripes. The border pattern is officially known asShepherds’ plaid, although it actually reminds me offrits(those little black dots at the bottom of windscreens). Other elements include blue piping and an “HOWAY THE LADS” inscription on the back of the collar.Theaway kitis not as much reminiscent of a Saudi national team kit as could quite literally be a Saudi national team kit of before. Thethird kit, in burnt orange and blue, is a fun number with a stitched crest; inspired by that incrediblelate 90s away piece. It has the Adidas trefoil logo to maximise the retro feel. Thegoaliegarms come in yellow, blue, purple, and pink, respectively.Nottingham ForestView image in fullscreenForest’s handsome home kit, combining old and new.Photograph: Adidas/Nottingham Forest FCForest’s new home kit is a throwback to itsfavoured early 90s strip, sharing the same polo-style collar and a wide pinstripe body. It is an extremely classy affair from Adidas, with a nice added detail being the also 90s-inspired shield crest. The keeper willwear yellow, orange, or blue. When the club, after its successful last season,initially releasedthe new home shirt it was yet to feature a front sponsor – and was all the more handsome for it. But now, just in time for the team’s opening game, it advertises … a betting company. Surprise, surprise.Theaway fitis primarily cream and features a neat detail: a weave replicating the lace designs the city is famous for. No third kit news at the time of writing.SunderlandView image in fullscreenThe new Sunderland shirt with its centrally aligned badge.Photograph: Hummel/Sunderland FCDanish brand Hummel frequently punches above its weight, and this smart new effort for Sunderland’s return to the top flight is no different.But not everybody is happy: the back of the players’ home shirt (but not the fan replica) iscatching flakfrom supporters for the number placement – a white panel has been introduced to abide by Premier League legibility rules. The rest of the shirt is an elegant creation; a black v-neck with thin bands of the traditional red-and-white is a key characteristic. Also eye-catching is the crest placement; centrally aligned for the first time since the 1990s. And why shouldn’t the Black Cats show it off when it is one of the prettiest around?In a similar move to Leeds, Sunderland’s snazzygoalie kitsallude to thepatterned tilesof a city landmark (in this case, the Bridge Hotel); while the gorgeously retro royal-blueaway outfieldthreads are further livened by a chequerboard weave with a subtle Roker Beach lighthouse motif. Thethird kitis an all-black number because: Black Cats, geddit?Tottenham HotspurView image in fullscreenA winning kit for the Europa League champions.Photograph: Nike/Tottenham Hotspur FCSpurs’s home kits have been rather banal and indistinguishable for a while now (sorry), but Nike has come up with something a little fresher this time for the Europa Leagueholders(although that is no consolationfor the departing Son). As with Sunderland, the new Spurs home shirt has a centrally aligned brand logo and club badge. The sleeve and underarm panels incorporate “Iron Ore” as an accent colour (Nike is at it again; they are grey), which is a departure, and ribbing on the body provides texture.Fans and players will also be wearing navy shorts with white socks. It is definitely the club’s least insipid home strip for a long time – although it retains a slight whiff of the training ground. More rousing is the luminous pink-and purple-gradient pinstripekeeper’s kit.The Lilywhites go all black withtheir away look– a prevalent choice this upcoming season. The Spurs kit in particular reminds one of Roger Federer’siconic 2007 US Open drip. Nike’s blurb describes it as “razor-sharp, engineered for speed and built for stealth”, which unfortunately does sound a lot like club legend Harry Kane in his prime. Theaway keeper’s kitis akin to the home one but in mint-and-forest green. Thethird kit is yet to be officially launched, but it looks as though the bright yellow and navy shirt will air the beautiful 90s-era crest.West HamView image in fullscreenJarrod Bowen models the Hammers’ new minimalist look.Photograph: Umbro/West Ham UnitedUmbro has gone back to basics for the Hammers’ fetching new home strip. The traditional claret colour is the majority presence, but it is the dapper taping detail on the ribbed collar and cuff – and discreet underarm blue inserts (the colour is relegated to a smaller role than usual) – that subtly elevate this minimalist take. The applique full club crest is revived here after last season’s hideous variation and the crossed-hammers symbol is also printed on the back of the neck. The socks and shorts are in white.Theaway stripis equally nice and calm. Supposedly it is a callback to the1996-97 away strip; I would argue that the call is not particularly loud. But it is a satisfyingly soft, creamy ecru with black sleeves and collar. Thethird kit, with a fold-over collar and a striking oversized Hammers logo on the breast, is a mix of submarine-deep navy as well as gold. Where the Umbro designers have had their welcome sugar rush is with thekeeper kits; each of which (in blue, orange, and lilac) has a jaunty shoulder and sleeve decoration.Wolverhampton WanderersView image in fullscreenWolves’ 2025-26 transformation.Photograph: Sudu/Wolverhampton Wonderers FCWolves’ latest home kit, made by Sudu, schools us on the history of Molineux. Before the site served as a football stadium, it was the location of the Molineux Pleasure Gardens; a Victorian public park with amusement offerings typical of the period. The traditional gold jersey features a debossed, ornamental print of swirls and shapes to honour that sense of fun. The overall look – from collar to cuff – is influenced by the club’s 70s threads. Thehome goalie kitis black and features the same print.The first-choice goalkeeper José Sá will wearpinkfor away fixtures, while the outfield players will be hitting the grassin turquoise; again, quite a popular colour for teams this season. This time the general feel is 80s-inspired, with dark green (almost black) ribbed collar and cuff. The third kit is yet to be released at the time of writing.Explore more on these topicsFootballPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Biddy Baxter, the TV genius who made Blue Peter matterBaxter was the sharp – if tough – TV brain behind the beloved children’s show’s most celebrated parts, from the studio pets to the coveted badgesMark LawsonMon 11 Aug 2025 07.45 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 15.26 EDTShareAs a child in Leicestershire in the 1940s,Biddy Baxterwas a devoted reader of the work of Enid Blyton. She sent the creator of Noddy and The Famous Five a fan letter and was so delighted to receive an answer that she replied with follow-up questions. To her dismay, the response was identical to the first.This sense of being let down by an adulated adult proved formative. When Baxter, who hasdied aged 92, was in charge of Blue Peter, the long-running children’s show that she essentially created, she introduced an alphabetical card index – that most efficient pre-digital database – to ensure that viewers received personalised replies.That innovation reflected the gentle side of her professional persona. Some presenters on the show complained of a darker side – domineering, dictatorial – but, if true, that editorial insistence reflected the extraordinary extent to which she wasBlue Peterand Blue Peter was her.It has been rare in the history of broadcasting for one person to mould and own a programme for so long. For 26 years (23 of them as editor) at Blue Peter, she was keeper of the flame and anyone seen as threatening its glow – staff, senior management, TV critics – was at risk of being burned.View image in fullscreenBiddy Baxter reads letters from Blue Peter fans while a lion cub lies on a sofa, in September 1968.Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty ImagesBaxter’s forcefulness may also have reflected the tactics required of a relatively rare powerful woman at theBBCin her time. The corporation was initially less male than many vintage British institutions – Lord Reith, the first director general, appointed three female heads of department in the 1920s – but the balance had shifted by the time Baxter joined in 1955. (As late as 1985, an internal report found that the male-female balance in senior positions was 159 to six.) Tellingly, when Baxter informed the careers department at Durham University that she sought a BBC career, she was steered towards secretarial or receptionist posts rather than the production jobs she envisaged.First employed as a studio manager in radio, she soon graduated to producing before, in 1962, being given a temporary transfer to TV due to a staffing crisis. (Something similar happened to David Attenborough, underlining the extent to which TV, in its early decades, was an accidental, undervalued medium.) When Baxter was given a permanent Blue Peter contract in November 1962, the programme (created by John Hunter Blair) had been running for four years. She made it into one of the most distinctive and significant broadcast brands, changing her own life and those of tens of millions of British children across many generations.Baxter introduced or popularised all the most celebrated elements – the Blue Peter badge for viewer achievement; the pets (most notably, the mongrel Petra and the border collie Shep); the presenters’ summer holiday to film reports in a foreign location; and the “makes”, in which a doll’s house or a fort was created from everyday family refuse such as cereal packets and washing-up liquid bottles.As a perfectionist, Baxter was irritated that the most attention resulted from things going wrong – a girl guides’ campfire threatening to burn down the studio, or Lulu the baby elephant copiously urinating and defecating before treading on the foot of the presenter John Noakes and dragging her zoo keeper through the mess.Although from a generation raised on the wireless, Baxter (like Attenborough) had an instinctive understanding of how television could and should work. The catchphrase associated with the makes, “Here’s one I made earlier,” as the presenter pulled a complete model from under the table, was a practical solution to the time constraints of a 15-minute programme (later lengthened to 25 minutes) now routinely used by craft and cookery shows. Another link phrase, “And now for something completely different” (later satirised by Monty Python), originated in the sudden jumps of subject that were a feature of the series.View image in fullscreenBiddy Baxter, photographed at Bafta.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianBaxter’s reputation inside and outside the BBC for tetchiness partly resulted from her fierce defence of Blue Peter’s legacy. Baxter was infuriated by claims that there had been two Petras (the second substituted when the first one died) and that she had sacked the presenter Christopher Trace in 1967 for getting divorced and Michael Sundin in 1985 for being gay. Baxter always insisted that the two hosts were shown the door for being difficult with the crew or unpopular with viewers, and that before Petra an unnamed puppy had died of distemper.The concept of the presenters being a big brother or sister to the viewers (the target age was six to 14) meant they were replaced as they aged. By 1988 it seemed anomalous to some that a 55-year-old was editing the leading BBC children’s show and it was perhaps convenient to both sides that Baxter resigned when her husband, the musical educationist John Hosier, took a job in Hong Kong. However, on returning to the UK she was tapped as an adviser to director generals for her sharp TV brain. The increasing marginalisation of Blue Peter due to technological trends – it is now screened weekly on a niche channel – was painful to her in later life.Strikingly, at a time when TV was considered disposable even within the industry – few shows were archived due to the cost and space of doing so – Baxter understood the significance of what she was doing, insisting on every show from the mid-60s onward being recorded. It was a declaration that Blue Peter mattered and, largely thanks to her, it did.Explore more on these topicsBlue PeterChildren's TVBBCTelevision industryTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then she had a near fatal brain bleed. The actor and artist discusses strength, survival, being upskirted on set, her violent run-ins with Harvey Weinstein and the performances she’s most proud ofMon 11 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 10.20 EDTShareAcouple of days before our interview, in late July, Sharon Stone announced on Instagram thather mother had died. When we meet over video link, I express my sympathies. Stone is known for her straight talking, but now she outdoes herself. “Mom, Dot, actually died a few months ago, but I was only ready to tell the public about it now because I always get my mad feelings first when people die.” What kind of mad, I ask – grief, confusion, loss? She smiles. “A little bit of anger and a little bit of ‘I didn’t fucking need you anyway’, you know!”Now she’s laughing. “My momwasn’tof a sunny disposition. She was hilarious, but she said terrible things to me. Dot swore like a Portuguese dock worker.” Which takes us to her mother’s final days. “She said: ‘I’m going to kick you in the cunt,’ to me probably 40 times in the last five days. But that was her delirium. And when the last thing your mother says to you before she dies is: ‘You talk too much, you make me want to commit suicide,’ and the whole room laughs, you think: that’s a hard one to go out on, Mom! But that’s how she was. This lack of ability to find tenderness and peace within herself.”Stone doesn’t do small talk. The actor, who became a household name with the 1992 erotic thriller Basic Instinct, is here to chat about her new film, Nobody 2, but the movie is going to have to wait. Stone talks about what she wants to talk about and today family dysfunction has top priority. To be fair, this makes sense – its impact has dominated much of her life, despite being hidden from the public until her 2021 memoir, The Beauty of Living Twice.That was when she revealed her maternal grandfather was a violent abuser and a paedophile. She said there hadn’t been a day in her mother’s life when Dot had not been beaten by him, from the age of five until she left the family home at nine to go into domestic service. Stone also said he had abused her and her sister when they were little girls.You never know what to expect with Stone. Horrifying trauma in one sentence, shopping at Cos the next. She’s at home in Los Angeles when we talk and looks fabulous – blond bob, huge pink specs, pearls “the size of small quail eggs”, a white shirt baggy enough for David Byrne, white trousers ripped in all the right places. She moves away from the smartphone, so I can see. “I will show you myentireensemble. The shirt’s down to my knees. Let me get where you can see all of me. Let me put you on my bookshelf and then you can seeallof me.” Now, she’s using her smartphone as a mirror. “I’m putting a little lipstick on for you.” I tell her I like her glasses. “Oh thanks. I’m a glasses whore, I have to be honest.”View image in fullscreen‘She was hilarious, but she said terrible things to me’ … with her mother in 2002.Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagicStone has often talked about being shy to the point of agoraphobia, but there is little sign of it today. As Dot said, she’s a talker: let the camera roll and you’ve got yourself a one-woman show. Imagine a scatological Norma Desmond as written by Alan Bennett.Her voice is deep and mafioso raspy. She talks in italics, deals in extremes, tells outrageous story after outrageous story, segueing between the savage and the empathic, naming names to give libel lawyers a heart attack, before finishing her sentences with: “Right?” as if daring you to disagree.For now, though, she’s not finished with Dot. Stone is 67 and for much of her life she thought her mother hated her. It was only later, when they became much closer, that she understood how troubled Dot’s life had been and the repercussions this had had for Stone and her siblings. Stone says Dot had a terrible death. “She was desperately afraid that when she died her mother and father would be there. She didn’t want to die, because she didn’t want to see them, because they were so awful. So I convinced her that I had put them in jail and they were not going to be there. She was in such hell.” She pauses. “Nobody comes through this life intact. So why do we pretend that one does?”Her mother certainly didn’t. Nor, for that matter, has Stone. In her memoir, she describes being locked in a room with her grandfather and her sister. It’s a beautiful piece of writing, merging the specific with the abstract so you’re never sure exactly what happened. At one point, she walks into a room when he appears to be sexually abusing her sister. Did he sexually abuse Stone, too? “Yes. And when I said so in my book, everybody went crazy about it and said I was telling other people’s stories. They were like: you’re telling your sister’s story, or this story, or that story. And I wasn’t telling anybody’s story. I didn’t name anybody’s name in my book. Not anybody unless they did any good.” It’s classic Stone, told with utter conviction – although she did name her sister.Was her sister upset with her? “She’s refused to read my book, even though she encouraged me to write it, as did my mom, and I dedicated my book to Mom.” Did her grandfather sexually abuse her mother, too? “Yes, of course, and all of her sisters. That’s why she was removed from her home when she was nine. In her gym class, she was bleeding through the back of her uniform and her teacher brought in social services. They removed her shirt and she had been so badly beaten that her back was covered in scars and blood.“I think the abuse is why all of her sisters went crazy. They were all treated for mental health problems. There were five of them and only my mom lived past 50. And they had a couple of other sisters who died in their early childhood.”Nobody comes through this life intact. So why do we pretend that one does?I ask how long her grandfather abused her for. “I got away from him by the time I was five or six, before he was super sexually abusive to me. I was a very savvy kid. I got away with much lighter abuse than other people did.”Stone knows she has upset people by exposing family secrets, but she’s willing to pay the price. “When you’re the person to break the family chain, nobody likes you, right? Your family doesn’t like you, your friends don’t know what is happening with you. People just think you’re crazy and there’s something wrong with you.”Although Stone’s relationship with her mother was troubled, she did observe a loving relationship between her mother and her father, Joe. Despite him being a harsh disciplinarian in her early years, Stone went on to have a wonderful relationship with Joe, a factory worker who became a tool and die manufacturer. He was a huge influence on her, telling her that if she wanted respect she had to demand it, and showing her how to assert herself in a man’s world. “My dad and I were tighter than two coats of paint.”I tell Stone I could listen to her talking about her family for ever, but we should talk about movies – particularly Nobody 2. She doesn’t seem to hear, because she has moved on to the contemporary US. “In my country, in a democracy, there is a thing that we have to respect the office of the president whether or not you agree with what’s happening. When the president decides to remove democracy, does that remove our agreement to respect the office of the presidency?”View image in fullscreen‘If you don’t like mothers and you don’t like women, you’re not going to get very far with creativity and expansiveness’ … with her eldest son, Roan, in 2021.Photograph: John MacDougall/AFP/Getty ImagesThat’s a good question, I say. What do you think? She says she doesn’t know, that she’s a Buddhist and in Buddhism they call it a koan – a paradoxical riddle that invites deep thought rather than a simple answer. She talks about the way the rights of protected minorities are being removed: “In our current administration, any disability is considered a fuck-off.”Take dyslexia, she says. Her son Roan has it “and he is running three corporations”, including Cahuenga Media Group, a production and licensing company that focuses on music, television and film-related media. Her brother Patrick, who died in 2023, had it and was a “brilliant” master carpenter. She points out that many architects and scientists are dyslexic. “But what we’re looking at now in America, is: ‘OK, no more disabilities.’ Suddenly, nobody with disabilities has value. OK, we’re gonna fire everyone in these scientific jobs. And guess what?France is taking all of our scientists.”Blimey! It’s not easy to keep up with Stone or get a word in (evidence suggests scientists are moving from the US to France because ofthe government’s funding cuts). She’s straight on to misogyny: “The sweetest fruit is at the end of the branch. These are the things that nature tells us, Mother Nature, Mother Gaia, Mother Earth. But if you don’t like mothers and you don’t like women, you’re not going to get very far with creativity and expansiveness.”Does it feel like an anti-women time in the US? She removes her glasses and pins me with her glare. “It doesn’t matter, because we makeyou. And we care foryou. And we raiseyou. And we feedyou. And we houseyou. And we show you where your stuff is, because you couldn’t find your fucking socks without us. So if you don’t have our intrauterine tracking device to help you find your ass in a snowstorm, I don’t know what you would do. So you can be as anti-women as you want to be, and you can make babies in a test tube if that’s the world you want to live in – and have a good time!”I assume she’s addressing Donald Trump, but it feels personal. I don’t want to live in that kind of world, I protest meekly. “Exactly! It’s never meant to be that way, because birds do it, bees do it, even educated fleas do it, so the rest of this stuff is just nonsense. To me. OK? Because I am very much in league with Mother Nature, Mother Gaia.”The young Stone was exceptionally bright, as she’s quick to tell me. She describes herself as “fiercely intelligent” (two well-chosen words) and her IQ is reportedly 154 (genius level). She skipped several grades at school; at 15, she and four boys were sent to Edinboro State College in Pennsylvania as an “experiment”, three years ahead of most of their peers. She majored in English literature and excelled at golf, but left before graduating. “My college professor was furious when I was leaving for modelling,” she says. “He was like: ‘You’re throwing away your career,’ because he really thought my career was in writing.”She moved to New York and became a successful model. In 1980, she made her movie debut as an extra in Woody Allen’s Stardust Memories, dazzlingly Monroe-esque, planting a kiss on a train window. She moved to Hollywood and took lessons from the acting coach Roy London, who also taught Brad Pitt, Robert Downey Jr, Forest Whitaker and Geena Davis. Over the next decade, she played numerous forgettable parts in forgettable films and television shows.View image in fullscreenBreakthrough … with her co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger in Total Recall.Photograph: Carolco Pictures/AllstarIn 1990, Paul Verhoeven cast her opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger inthe science fiction classic Total Recall. When she discovered Verhoeven’s next film was about an enigmatic writer and murder suspect called Catherine Tramell, she was determined to get the part. The problem was, Verhoeven, the screenwriter, Joe Eszterhas, and the male lead, Michael Douglas, didn’t want her, not least because she was largely unknown.Twelve actors(including the top choice, Michelle Pfeiffer, as well as Davis, Julia Roberts, Debra Winger and Kathleen Turner) are said to have turned down the part, which was regarded as risque and risky. Even when she started filming, Stone was convinced they were still looking for a replacement.Basic Instinct was a huge success, becoming theninth-highest-grossing film of 1992and taking more than $350m worldwide. More significantly, it wasthetalking point of the year. LGBTQ+ campaigners picketed it because they believed the depiction of Tramell was homophobic – a rare high-profile lesbian or bisexual character in a blockbuster and a sociopath at best. Critics scavenged over the film’s cultural carrion. Was it exploitative tack or, as the feminist academic Camille Paglia proclaimed, a compelling exploration of sexuality and power dynamics? Paglia said Stone gave “one of the great performances by a woman in screen history”, calling Tramell “a great vamp figure, like Mona Lisa herself, like a pagan goddess”.And then there wasthatimage. Or, at least, the idea of it. A split-second long – too short to fully register. Yet, somehow, almost seeing her vulva as she uncrossed her legs was more scandalous than simply seeing it. Stone said she had been duped into the shot, writing in her memoir that she was asked to remove her underwear to prevent light reflection and told nothing revealing would be shown. She had no idea it would be used as it was. Appalled, she considered legal action against the film-makers, but ultimately accepted the shot because it was true to Tramell’s character and artistic truth trumped personal humiliation. Basic Instinct madeSharon Stoneand, to an extent, destroyed her. Astonishingly, that one image came to define her.‘I didn’t know that this moment would change my life’ … recreating the infamous leg-cross scene from Basic Instinct at the GQ Germany awards in 2019.She’s still proud of the film and regards it as a great performance – one only she could have given. The problem is, she says, casting directors deliberately conflated her with Tramell. “They said I was just like the character, like, somehow, they found someone who was just like that and she slipped into the clothes and it was magically recorded on film. Not that it was a difficult part to play and that 12 other actresses of great fame and fortune turned it down. Then, as it played everywhere on the globe for the next 20 years, people started to go: ‘Do you think this really has anything to do with the fact that we thought we saw up her skirt? I think maybe it’s actually a pretty good performance.’“So it went from me being nominated for a Golden Globe and people laughing when they called my name in the room to people giving me standing ovations and making me the woman of the year. People came to recognise: she’s not going away, the film’s not going away, the impact of the film is not going away.” When she was named GQ Germany’s woman of the year in 2019, she recreated the scene, talked about the importance of empowerment and said, devastatingly: “There was a time when all I was was a joke.”The film didn’t go away, but Stone did. After Basic Instinct, she made one great movie, turning in an outstanding performance as the damaged con artist Ginger McKenna inMartin Scorsese’s Casino. And then, I begin to say …She finishes the sentence for me. “And then I got nothing. I never got any more parts.” Why? “I really wish you could tell me. Sometimes I think it was because I was too good.” Stone is not averse to bigging herself up. Nor is she averse to a conspiracy theory.“Sometimes I think when you get nominated for an Academy Award and the greatest living actor on the planet doesn’t, that’s an imbalance in the male-female dynamic that is not great.” Does she mean Robert De Niro, her Casino co-star? She nods, before suggesting it wasn’t De Niro that was upset, but the powers that be.Stone returns to the “too good” theory, telling me about a party she was at with Hollywood’s glitterati before the Oscars ceremony. “We were in this very small room. Sidney Poitier was there, Woody Allen, everyone. Francis Coppola came up to me and he put a hand on my shoulder, like my dad used to when something really serious was about to happen. And he said: ‘I need to tell you something and it’s really hard.’ He said: ‘You’re not going to win the Oscar.’ And I said: ‘What?’ And he said: ‘You’re not going to win the Oscar, Sharon.’ I went: ‘Why?’ And he went: ‘I didn’t win it for The Godfather and Marty didn’t win it for Raging Bull and you’re not going to win it for Casino.’View image in fullscreen‘I am a big fat loser like Marty Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola’ … with Robert De Niro in Casino, for which she earned an Oscar nomination.Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty Images“I looked at him and he went: ‘They can’t hear opera. And when you lose, Marty and I are going to be in the room, Sharon, and we want you to know you’re going to lose with us and we are there with you. But your performance will stand the test of time. Over the years, no one will remember who won and lost, but they will remember your performance.”The way she tells the story, with such po-faced gravitas, is some performance in itself. She continues, in the voice of Coppola: “‘And what you have to do as an actress is remember you are not a regular actress, you are an opera singer. And not everyone will understand you, and not everyone will understand your ability. You will lose with Marty and you will lose with me, but you will always be in our losers’ circle.’” She finally allows herself a smile. “So that is what I have carried through my life – that I am a big fat loser like Marty and Francis Ford Coppola.”It’s hard to know why Stone didn’t get offered the roles she deserved after Casino, although, aside from the conspiracy theories, there were some other reasons. In 2000, she and her second husband, Phil Bronstein, adopted Roan and she focused on motherhood. A year later, at 43, she had a near fatal stroke. It’s a miracle she survived – she says her brain bled for nine days and doctors gave her a 1% chance of survival. She had to relearn to walk, speak and read.Incredibly, she made a full recovery, but offers of work dried up. “In those days, as a woman, if something happened to you, you were done,” she says. “It was as though you did something bad or wrong. So even when I wanted to come back to work, it was like: ‘Sure, you can do four episodes of Law and Order,’ and that’s it. I did everything I was allowed to do to pay my penance for getting sick.” How long did that last? “That went on and on and on and on and I made nothing. And it just eventually became impossible to work.”Why didn’t I get more parts? I really wish you could tell me. Sometimes I think it was because I was too goodWhen she was offered parts, she says, they were rubbish. “I reached the point where, after my stroke, and nobody wanting me, and people wanting me to do this silly, diminished work, I decided that I’m not going to work any more.” She corrects herself. She decided not to accept roles she didn’t like, which in effect meant not working.She believes she has continued to be punished for Basic Instinct by the industry and in her private life. Stone says that when she and Bronstein got divorced in 2004, the film played a significant role in her losing custody of Roan. “They had my eight-year-old on the stand at one point, asking him if they knew his mother did sex movies.” She claims they reduced her to a soft pornography actor, then suggested that made her an unsuitable mother. She says the battle for Roan lasted 11 years, at which point she was finally given responsibility for Roan again. Nevertheless, at the end of her book, she thanks Bronstein and his wife “for finding a path to a whole, healthy and blending family with me. There is no greater gift.” As she says, she looks for the positive.In 2005, she adopted her second son, Laird, now 20, as a single parent, followed by her third son, 19-year-old Quinn, a year later. With no quality film work coming in, she focused on the art forms she had loved as a child – writing and painting. Her gorgeous impressionist and abstract expressionist paintings now sell for tens of thousands of dollars. The titles (Quaaludes, Hoisted on My Own Petard, If We Make It) could be short stories.I ask what the paintingIt’s My Garden, Assholeis about. “I was with a friend who was in her early 40s and had just had her second baby after losing her first. We were discussing how her in-laws had the audacity to tell her they thought she was a little too fat from the second pregnancy when a drone flew over my back yard. I thought: so many people have a lot of opinions about what we should do with our bodies and our faces while we’re delivering life on this planet, and taking care of everybody, and I was like: ‘You know what, it’s my garden, asshole!’”View image in fullscreen‘I’m having a fun time’ … at Torino film festival in 2024.Photograph: Daniele Venturelli/Getty ImagesStone also became an activist, raising millions for people with HIV. In 2016, at 58, she went back to university to get the degree she had started at 15. “When Hillary [Clinton] was running for president and said: ‘You can do anything,’ I thought: that’s true, I should get my degree.”Since Basic Instinct 2 in 2006 – much disparaged by critics and which she called “a piece of shit” – Stone has made few movies of note. But things are changing. This month, she’s back with Nobody 2, about a nobody, played byBob Odenkirk, who turns out to be a top assassin. “Now, I’m making good films. I was good in Nobody 2 and I know it.” She certainly looks as if she’s having fun as the crime boss Lendina. Stone says when she was offered the part, she insisted on transforming her into a feminist hero. “I said: ‘I need this villain to be more personal to me.’ I don’t want to play villains unless they touch the zeitgeist. So I wanted this villain to feel as if she came out of social media, because that is the most scary thing right now.”Why is she so often cast as a villain? “I think very beautiful, smart people are perceived in very specific ways. Because I’m a woman who is beautiful, it’s easier to have me not be emotionally intelligent, not have me be deep, not have me be tender and full. People don’t really believe that a beautiful woman is accessible to them.” And inaccessibility, she says, is regarded as a form of villainy. “Men don’t even ask you to date because they can’t imagine you are accessible to them. Within society, we have never said a woman can be beautiful and smart. And kind. And nice. And funny. And a mom. And the breadwinner. No, no, no, no. She couldn’t be all those things, because then,oh my God,she would be equal to a man! If I was beautiful and smart andnice,what would happen to society?”‘We don’t need more small-penis energy’… Sharon Stone on why she swapped acting for artRead moreFive more minutes, the publicist says. Stone is on a roll. “I could be UN person of the year, which I was [she was named the UN Correspondents Associationglobal citizen of the yearin 2023 for her humanitarian work]. I could pitch ideas to the United Nations and have them fulfilled and no one may ever know. I could be a Nobel Peace Summit award winner [in 2013 for her HIV and Aids work] and an Einstein winner [she won the Einstein Spirit of Achievement award in 2007, also for her HIV and Aids work]. I could win these awards, but we can’t also have me be nice, or kind, or compassionate, because what would happen?The. World. Would. Fall. Apart.”Actually, I say, one of my favourite films of hers is one in which sheiskind. In The Mighty, she plays the mother of Kieran Culkin’s Freak, a 12-year-old with a terminal condition. She says it’s one of her favourites, too. “And you know why I got that film? I’ll tell you exactly why I got that film. I got that film because I had a production deal with Harvey Weinstein and after years of him paying for my offices and my staff, paying for everything, he realised he wasn’t getting anything he was hoping for. And he turned around and said: ‘I’ve got this children’s book and I have to produce it.’” She stops, briefly. “But I was not going to fuck Harvey Weinstein.”Did he try it on with her? “Well, I’m not the girl he’s going to take into a hotel room naked and I’m not the girl he’s going to grab. Iamthe girl he threw across the room at a cocktail party. And Iamthe girl that he hit. And Iamthe girl whose ass he grabbed, but I’m not the girl he’s going to rape or molest and I’m not the girl he’s going to ask for a massage, right? But I am the girl he’s going to give a production deal to and going to get fed up with and give a children’s movie to deal with.”Stone has been associated with amfAR, an Aids research foundation, for 30 years, hosting many of its fundraising galas. In 2007, Weinstein got involved with the charity. “Harvey then put himself on the board, right? And backstage he would shove me around and yell at me and come on stage and grab the mic from me and try to make these inappropriate deals with his friends, like we’re gonna take that money from that guy on this item. Then I’d take the mic from him and say: ‘Harvey, get off the stage, I call the numbers, we’re not taking that deal.’“I’d come off the stage and he’d shove me across the room and go: ‘Don’thumiliate me,’ and I’d go: ‘You’re a crook, Harvey, get your fucking hands off me.’ He did not try to fuck me, but he was definitely physically violent with me. He slapped me, he threw me across the room, he shoved me around countless times.”Within society, we have never said a woman can be beautiful and smart. And kind. And nice. And funny. And a mom. And the breadwinnerLast question please, the publicist says. Perhaps she’s as exhausted as I am. Stone is over the top, a little unreliable, thoroughly immodest and rather magnificent.But it feels as if she has barely started. There is so much more to talk about. She has not even mentioned the time the producer Robert Evans advised her to have sex with her Sliver co-star, William Baldwin, to save the film and get a better performance out of him. (She was appalled and refused.) Or the time she had her breasts reconstructed after having benign tumours removed and the surgeongave her a nonconsensual breast enlargementbecause he thought she would be grateful.A couple of days before our interview, it was announced that Eszterhas, the Basic Instinct writer,was planning a reboot. Would she take part in it? She laughs. “There’s not going to be a Basic Instinct reboot. I hate to break it to you, but Joe Eszterhas couldn’t write himself out of a Walgreens drug store.”It’s 20 minutes since the publicist told me to wrap up. I’m beginning to feel guilty, but Stone is still happily talking about empty nest syndrome, now that her youngest boys have left for college, and her plans for the future. She says she may lease out her home because she has so many projects on the go in so many places. She mentions her part in the new series of Euphoria and “a beautiful film” called In Memoriam that she has already completed.It sounds like you’re in a good place, I say. “I’m having a fun time. All of a sudden, the kids are out and I’m like:nowwhat am I going to do? I think going back to work is what’s happening.” Despite everything – the abuse, the stroke, the fallout from Basic Instinct, the losses – she says she has always been a glass-half-full kind of gal. Actually, she says, even an empty glass can have its positives. “It can get refilled, right? Sometimes an empty glass is what you need.”Nobody 2 is in cinemas in Australia from 14 August and the UK, the US and Ireland from 15 AugustExplore more on these topicsSharon StoneThe big interviewinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Seven people in total were killed including al-Sharif, theAl Jazeeracorrespondent Mohammed Qreiqeh, and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa, according to Al Jazeera.This is my will and my final message. If these words reach you, know that Israel has succeeded in killing me and silencing my voice.First, peace be upon you and Allah’s mercy and blessings. Allah knows I gave every effort and all my strength to be a support and a voice for my people, ever since I opened my eyes to life in the alleys and streets of the Jabaliya refugee camp. My hope was that Allah would extend my life so I could return with my family and loved ones to our original town of occupied Asqalan (al-Majdal). But Allah’s will came first, and His decree is final.I have lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification – so that Allah may bear witness against those who stayed silent, those who accepted our killing, those who choked our breath, and whose hearts were unmoved by the scattered remains of our children and women, doing nothing to stop the massacre that our people have faced for more than a year and a half.View image in fullscreenAnas al-Sharif with his daughter, Sham, and son, Salah.Photograph: FacebookI entrust you with Palestine – the jewel in the crown of the Muslim world, the heartbeat of every free person in this world. I entrust you with its people, with its wronged and innocent children who never had the time to dream or live in safety and peace. Their pure bodies were crushed under thousands of tons of Israeli bombs and missiles, torn apart and scattered across the walls. I urge you not to let chains silence you, nor borders restrain you. Be bridges toward the liberation of the land and its people, until the sun of dignity and freedom rises over our stolen homeland.I entrust you to take care of my family. I entrust you with my beloved daughter, Sham, the light of my eyes, whom I never got the chance to watch grow up as I had dreamed. I entrust you with my dear son, Salah, whom I had wished to support and accompany through life until he grew strong enough to carry my burden and continue the mission. I entrust you with my beloved mother, whose blessed prayers brought me to where I am, whose supplications were my fortress and whose light guided my path. I pray that Allah grants her strength and rewards her on my behalf with the best of rewards.I also entrust you with my lifelong companion, my beloved wife, Umm Salah (Bayan), from whom the war separated me for many long days and months. Yet she remained faithful to our bond, steadfast as the trunk of an olive tree that does not bend – patient, trusting in Allah, and carrying the responsibility in my absence with all her strength and faith. I urge you to stand by them, to be their support after Allah Almighty.If I die, I die steadfast upon my principles. I testify before Allah that I am content with His decree, certain of meeting Him, and assured that what is with Allah is better and everlasting. O Allah, accept me among the martyrs, forgive my past and future sins, and make my blood a light that illuminates the path of freedom for my people and my family.

Toys R Us takes me to Christmas Eve circa 1985, trying to find the last brunette doll for my younger sister, who was implacably opposed to dolls that were blond, even while she herself was. John Lewis, 2009, eyeball to eyeball with a foe for the last 50% marked-down Buzz Lightyear; she was the very devil, wild-eyed and determined, but I could have been looking in a mirror. Hamleys, Christmas Eve again, 2015, trying to fabricate new interests for my six-year-old daughter, because I was against gendered playthings and we already had all theNerf gunsit was possible to have.I was anti-consumerist while consuming quite a lot, against plastic while simultaneously grossed out by other anti‑plastic parents, and didn’t want to raise spoilt little Fauntleroys yet at the same time hated saying “no”. It’s not easy holding on to that many contradictions or, if you prefer, being that dumb.One shop, The Entertainer, was an oasis by comparison, because it seemed angled towards the small and the cheap. Loom bands, Lol dolls, single-unit Lego men, mechanical puppies that could backflip – which can still make me stop and marvel (so agile and for only £9.99!) even now the kids are 17 and 15. The font on the shopfront looked cheap, too, and I mean that in the best possible way.It doesn’t surprise me to learn that the founders, Gary and Catherine Grant, built that up from a single unit, which they bought on loan in 1981, to a 160-store, multimillion-pound empire in the UK. They didn’t know anything about toys when they started, but they knew what parents wanted, which was not to have a nervous breakdown. But I was still amazed when they announced this morning that they would betransferring the business to an employee trust, so that it will soon be 100% owned by its workforce of nearly 2,000 people.The normal expectations of the self-made entrepreneur run as follows: it’s very male-coded, “self-made man” being the default, “self-made woman” sounding a bit like a grammatical error made in a foreign language. Nobody explains why, because the self-made man is too busy to explain, he is always shouting. (That bit comes from Alan Sugar; Lord love him, he actually doesn’t shout that much, he just deploys his plosives to dramatic effect and is very sure of himself. Let’s say he is shout-adjacent.)The Entertainer founder to hand over UK’s biggest toy shop chain to staffRead moreHaving come from nothing, the generic self-made man is expected to put profit above everything – and considered noble for doing so. He hates handouts, complains about tax and doesn’t like plodders, which is to say, anyone who isn’t the boss – which is everyone, because he is, and how could there be two of him?Even while the terminology is very masculine, he can, of course, be female. If anything, that just makes her more of a one-off. Since astronomical wealth can be alienating to behold, self-made men generally take the edge off, rehumanising themselves with their devotion to family – again, it’s always “family man”; there is no such thing as a “family woman”. This, twinned with his or her admirably shark-like quest for profit, turns into a rationale for keeping all the money. It’s billed almost as a kind of altruism, that the self-made man will stop at nothing to give his or her children what he or she never had, with greed and rapacity washed away by the irrefutable logic of the entrepreneurial character.The Grants were known already as a different sort of self-made, cleaving to values other than profit as a result of their Christianity, most memorably when they refused to stock Harry Potter merch in the late 00s because they didn’t want children to experiment with “darkness”. It’s probably faith that has informed this decision, too, but they land an important point for the religious and irreligious: it’s not written in the stars that the price of profitability is carelessness and that all entrepreneurs are the same. The necessity of ruthlessness in business has had a hell of a PR campaign, but that doesn’t make it true.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Alongside his numerous policy failures, oneCornell University studyfound that he was the biggest source of Covid-19 misinformation. But if there’s one redeeming feature to Trump’s pandemic record, it has to be his leadership on Operation Warp Speed – a massive, government-funded initiative that played a pivotal role in fast-tracking Covid-19 vaccines.“Operation Warp Speed stands as one of the most remarkable scientific and humanitarian achievements of the past half-century,”the former US surgeon general Jerome Adamssaid. It directed billions of dollars into vaccine development and manufacturing, particularly into the mRNA platform, which became the backbone of the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.Vaccines work by preparing the body’s immune system to identify and successfully attack foreign agents entering the body. Traditional vaccines use weakened or inactivated viruses to offer a baby version for the body to fight and learn from. These vaccines are often produced by growing the virus in hen’s eggs, which means production is slow and can take months to scale up. In contrast, the mRNA platform functions like a plug-and-play video game console: you just “plug in” the genetic code of a particular virus or pathogen. The vaccineprovides instructionsto our bodies to make parts of the virus in our own cells, which then prompts an immune response.The process of creating and manufacturing these vaccines is much faster and more flexible than their traditional counterparts. This is especially important for a disease such as avian flu, which has an up to 100% mortality rate in chickens. But despite the speed in which they come together, there is still a considerable time-lag before mass rollout to allow for clinical trials to ensure human safety, test for side-effects and figure out optimal dosing. During the Covid pandemic, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were created within weeks of research teams receiving the genetic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from China in January 2020. What took a year was the testing and regulatory approval processes to ensure there was trust in their safety.Given Trump’s success with Operation Warp Speed, it’s particularly bizarre that Robert F Kennedy Jr, his health and human services secretary, has announced$500m in cutsto the mRNA vaccine investment portfolio. These include cancelling funding for Moderna’s development into a late-stage H5N1 avian flu vaccine. I asked Prof Rebecca Katz, a global health security expert and former US State Department adviser, for her assessment of the damage. She called it: “A self-inflicted wound to a vital organ.”On its own, RFK Jr’s decisionisn’t surprising, considering his longstanding anti-vax advocacy and cult-like following. He has built a whole identity on anti-science rhetoric and he is especially vocal about the supposed dangers of mRNA technology. But being an anti-vaxxer is also a tricky road to navigate:RFK Jr upset his basewhen, under considerable political pressure, he finally endorsed MMR vaccinations during the Texas measles outbreak.But putting one personality aside, what do these cuts mean for the health of people living in the US and the wider world? It’s bad news. Take the example ofH5N1 avian flu. This virus has shown concerning step-changes including becoming endemic in wild birds, infecting a number of poultry farms, and now has sufficient mutations to enable cow-to-cow (mammal to mammal) transmission in the US among dairy cattle. With its circulation in certain herds of dairy cattle has come a rise in human infections (cow-to-human). The virus is nowone mutation awayfrom easier transmission among humans. That’s the nightmare scenario: an influenza pandemic, possibly more lethal than Covid-19.If a human-to-human transmissible H5N1 strain appears, the existing mRNA infrastructure could be used to rapidly develop a targeted vaccine. Many countries, including the UK, have been stockpiling vaccine components or ramping up surveillance. Under the Biden administration, the US had been among the leaders in this effort. By shelving investment and halting further development, the US is essentially gambling that we won’t need quick medical countermeasures. It’s a dangerous bet. When the next pandemic happens, the cost in human lives could be much higher than we witnessed in 2020.Can other countries simply pick up the slack with mRNA production? Not easily. After the Covid pandemic led to huge disparities in which places in the world had access to vaccine supply, many countries starting planning for their own vaccine and mRNA hubs. They didn’t want to be dependent on the charity of the US or UK to donate them doses: they wanted to independently respond effectively. On aNational Academies projectthat I was vice-chair of on the global coordination of vaccines for pandemic influenza, we looked closely into regional production, including in Africa. What I learned from experts across the world is thatvaccine production, especially mRNA-based vaccines, requires a high degree of technical expertise, quality control and highly specialised supply chains. It will happen in other places, but not quickly enough to shoulder the impact of the US decision.Unlike foreign aid cuts, where the effect is felt immediately in the shutting down of food programmes or health clinics, cuts to research funding have a slower, deeper impact, especially in terms of expertise and knowledge generation. Research programmes that were working on pandemic preparedness are closing. Postdoctoral researchers aren’t finding jobs, without the necessary soft money to support them. PhD programmes have been frozen or cancelled. Universities, highly dependent on government funding, are scaling back their research activities in health, especially in areas that money is being cut from. Perhaps most devastating of all: smart, ambitious young scientists have fewer opportunities to develop careers in public health research and vaccine development. They’ll look elsewhere – into AI, tech, finance. Where will the expertise come from in the next 15 to 20 years if the career pipeline is being shut down?RFK Jr may position himself as Making America Healthy Again, but in reality, his policies make the entire world more vulnerable. He may, in fact, be the most dangerous person in theTrump administration– not because he’s loud or erratic, but because he’s steadily eroding the foundation of public health research and infrastructure. This isn’t just bad policy. It’s a generational setback. In that light, RFK Jr stands not merely as a controversial figure but as a serious risk to national and global health security.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghExplore more on these topicsVaccines and immunisationOpinionHealthRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationMedical researchcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a cynical, idiotic doom loopMon 11 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 06.28 EDTShareImmigration has been a fixture of Britain’s political discourse for so long, it now feels, like Voltaire’s god, that if the issue did not exist, we would have to invent it. What would our politics look like, what would the broad majority of Britain’s media do with themselves, without immigration? It has become such a feature of the country’s political culture, it amounts to a sort of historical exhibit: “rivers of blood”, the “hostile environment”, “go home” vans, “controls on immigration”crockery, the Brexit “breaking point” poster, the Windrush scandal, “stop the boats”, “island of strangers”. And now, summer riots.What conjoins all of these is one thing: misinformation. I have banged on for years in this column about the disconnect between immigration discourse and the reality of how hard and expensive it is to enter the UK and stay there. A poll from last week demonstrates that gulf with striking simplicity. Theconclusion to be drawnfrom the survey is that support for hardline immigration policies is linked to ignorance about migration figures. Half of all respondents thought that there were more migrants living in the UK illegally than legally.According to YouGov, these perceptions are “wide of the mark”, with those in the country legally vastly outnumbering those who are not, even at the most generous estimates of irregular migration.But there is a new development related to that ignorance. Over the past 20 years or so, immigration demands have shifted from variations of “controlling our borders” and reducing numbers of new migrants, to demanding that zero migrants be allowed to enter, and “requiring large numbers of migrants who came to the UK in recent years to leave”. This is an “extraordinary” development, according to YouGov. Indeed, the last time a member of a political party even hinted at any sort of deportation policy was in the late 00s, when British National party leader Nick Griffin (another installation in the immigration exhibit)statedthat he would “encourage” voluntary repatriation of legal migrants and “those of foreign descent to return to their lands of ethnic origin”. On Saturday, far-right protesters clashed with police whileholding signssaying “Remigration NOW”.This latest mutation of migration discourse to include mass deportation is down to, as ever, media and politics. Rightwing media not only constantly cover immigration negatively, but go through different seasons of doing so, depending on the political climate. The 2010s was aboutMuslims, the run-up to Brexit aboutcertain east European nationalitiesand how their presence had a deleterious effect on British society, and the latest phase is about “numbers”. Specifically, numbers of irregular arrivals. The small boats fixation here is central, as they evoke a sense of losing control of the borders, sadly no longer as easy to pull off after Brexit.That fixation has been mirrored in political discourse. The last government’s contribution to this was the Rwanda scheme and Rishi Sunak’s “stop the boats” campaign – one of his five promises, which was given equal weight to such macro challenges as bringing down inflation and cutting NHS waiting lists. And this government has continued in the same vein.1:17Far-right and anti-asylum protesters gather in Nuneaton – videoKeir Starmer’s “island of strangers” speech, which referred to an era of rising migration as a “squalid chapter” in the country’s history, was the rhetorical opening salvo in an anti-immigration campaign that in its tone and relentlessness reinforces the issue as a crisis. Starmer’s X account constantly posts highlights of crackdowns against those who try “tocheat the system” and even Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)-likevideos of deportations. In the past week alone, Starmer has posted 14 times on X; 10 of those posts were about immigration, particularly irregular arrivals and those arriving on small boats. This is a wildly disproportionate emphasis, considering this cohort makes up aminuscule percentageof overall immigration to the UK.The result is a framing of all of immigration through the lens of irregular arrivals, and therefore cultivating a sense of crisis and overwhelm. Astudy by the University of Birminghamthat surveyed thousands of media texts and political documents earlier this year found that that disproportionate focus on small boats shapes public attitudes towards migration, fuelling “a sense of crisis and emergency”.There’s something compulsive about all of this, almost addictive. Posturing on immigration is a cheap hit, a low-cost (to politicians – the cost is very high for migrants) way to gesture at some sort of executive action, for a government otherwise in the mire. The irony is that this fixation produces ignorance about all immigration, which means there is less and less the government can do to address the very myths it has seeded. If you create the impression that small boats, “illegality” and cheating are the defining feature of the UK’s immigration, then how can you expect the public to make distinctions that their very government does not?Rupert Lowe reports charity rowers to coastguard as possible ‘illegal migrants’Read moreAnd so in a grim spiral, Labour continues to fuel the sense of crisis, then chase it, never catching up, and always setting the stage for those further right to make ever bigger promises of crackdown and deranged claims abouthousingandcrime. The galling idiocy of it all is that posting hectically about immigration and rolling out hardline measures is self-defeating. It doesn’t even work to instil confidence in Labour as the only credible party on immigration. The more Labour presses the issue, the more it reinforces the validity of anti-immigration rhetoric, empowering Reform as the specialised vehicle of crackdown. To voters mobilised by this, Labour can never be better than the real thing.And so it can only be a spiral. In order to keep immigration as that easily activated issue central to a political system that has few answers to any of the structural problems that are most salient to people’s everyday lives, from the cost of living to lack of housing, we must always be at some sort of breaking point. That toxic energy has to go somewhere. It’s not the sort of thing that can be just a casual part of discourse and stay in a holding pattern. The stakes are constantly higher, more frightening, more defining of why things are bad. And on and down it goes.We must wean the UK off its “immigration dependency”,Starmer saidin 2022. But the problem is his – and the entire political establishment’s – dependency on immigration as an issue to be exploited, rather than to be handled with honesty, duty of care to immigrants who are now terrorised in the streets, and to the whole country’s social cohesion.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But on one point – the Palestinians’ rejection of two states – they’ve been more-or-less correct. For me, and many others, the fundamental injustice of the establishment of the state ofIsrael– which occurred through massive, deliberate and purposeful ethnic cleansing designed to create a Jewish majority in historic Palestine – meant that Israel never really attained moral legitimacy among Palestinians. As Robert Malley and Hussein Agha write in their new book, Tomorrow Is Yesterday: “deep down, most Palestinians, though ready to accept Israel’s existence, have not accepted its historical legitimacy”, a statement whose veracity I can attest to.I remember being a 15-year-old in Palestine. I remember being held up at checkpoints in the West Bank, and being unable to visit Jerusalem or Israel because of the color of my ID card, in effect, because of my race. I could see how unjust, how retrograde, the entire basis of Israel was. No amount of German or western guilt over the Holocaust would make me accept the idea that Jewish supremacy in Palestine was somehow desirable, or just. I think that continues to be true for the overwhelming majority of Palestinians. Possibly, for the overwhelming majority of humanity in the post-colonial global south.That’s not to say that the political process – which commenced in Madrid and Oslo –wasn’t undertaken in good faith by sincere and earnest people. I know some of the negotiators on the Palestinian side, like Diana Buttu, a principled advocate for Palestinian rights for decades now. Daniel Levy, who negotiated for the Israelis, has been an outspoken opponent of Israeli apartheid and the genocide inGaza, and a formidable critic of the peace process in the past 20 years.At its height in 1995, the Oslo process, which was supposed to produce a Palestinian state, but more importantly, an end to claims, commanded the support of two-thirds of Palestinians. Many of them, like my parents, were prepared to close a chapter on history, to swallow their grievances so that their children might live. Similarly, the Palestinian negotiators I’ve met in the past two decades each understood the basic deficit of justice, the imbalance in the ledger, but they sought to abort a conflict which has ravenously claimed the future at every turn.In many cases their intentions were honorable.And yet, the failure of the peace process was preordained, readily apprehensible to anyone who lived in the Occupied Territories in the 1990s, when the settlements truly metastasized. It should have been obvious to anyone with a map and a history book, too. That’s because Zionism, Israel’s animating ideology, adheres to classically European colonialism, which continues to be the best framework for understanding Palestine/Israel. Writing in October 2003 in the New York Review of Books, the moral thinker and historian Tony Judt described Israel as “an anachronism”, essentially a throwback to the Belgian Congo or 18th-century Australia. Israel’s extermination of native life in Gaza is anachronistic, too. It rhymes, in the worst way.There were glaring structural reasons for Oslo’s failure as well. The fact that many of the American negotiators were Zionists was underreported, and underappreciated. Dennis Ross, who led the American team, is a Zionist, indistinguishable to my eyes from Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak, two former Israeli prime ministers. Bill Clinton, who was president at the time, recently referred to “Judea and Samaria”, coded Zionist language for the occupied West Bank. In effect, Oslo pitted a stateless people against two nuclear-armed states led by people who were fundamentally invested in Jewish supremacy in Palestine.Emmanuel Macron’s decision to recognize a Palestinian state in September amounts to little, as Donald Trump noted. I do not know Macron’s intentions, but the Palestinians have never really warmed to European and American condescension, which is implicit in every conditional statement, every contingent incrementalism. Mark Carney’s strange, confused statement that Canada would only accept a “Zionist Palestinian state” is grimly entertaining for anyone with a basic grasp of the issues. Anyone who isn’t a dilettante, in other words.Now, in the midst of a genocide, the Palestinians are best served by abandoning any effort to attain self-rule in the Occupied Territories. A reorientation towards basic rights is overdue, along with recognition the Palestinian struggle was never really about a seat at the United Nations, representation in Unesco, or Fifa. The force of the Palestinian cause rests in one principle: justice.Two years ago I thought justice meant a single state with equal rights between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. But now, the Palestinians are confronted by a difficulty: no one is able to articulate what justice means in the wake of so much slaughter, of so many dead men, women and children, dead babies. The genocide has changed my perspective on the majority of Jewish Israelis, and once they retire their guns and mortars – as one day they surely will – we will have to reckon with the moral, and actual, wreckage of their century-longSturm und Drang,their violent ejaculations, in Palestine.Ahmed Moor is a writer and fellow at the Foundation for Middle East PeaceExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionPalestinian territoriesGazacommentShareReuse this content"

This outrageous landgrab is ethnic cleansing in plain sightMon 11 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 03.24 EDTShareIt is hard to describe in words the pain of witnessing your people being destroyed for more than 670 days. It is even more unfathomable to contemplateanother Israeli escalation, after witnessing so much suffering and so many crimes committed against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip. How can this be allowed in full view of the world for so long? Will the world stand by?Israel’s security cabinet declared this escalation when it approved a plan to “fully occupy” the Gaza Strip and attack concentrations of population, starting with Gaza City itself. The consequences of this newest military onslaught are foreseeable and predictable. InMay 2024, Israel attacked Rafahdespite international warnings and in defiance of an international court of justice order – Rafah no longer exists. In November and December 2024, Israelattackedthe northern towns of Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya, and destroyed them in a campaign that former minister of defence Moshe Ya’alondescribed as “ethnic cleansing”. More recently, Israel unilaterally violated the ceasefire agreement, imposed starvation on the 2 million survivors anddestroyed the southern city of Khan Younis.All these actions are in violation of the three rulings on genocide by the international court of justice (ICJ) in January, March and May 2024. The ICJ identified a risk of genocide in January 2024 and stipulated measures thatIsraelneeded to follow to prevent the committing of genocide, including the unlimited provision of humanitarian aid. By all accounts, Israel has been violating these measures. An attack on Gaza City will be the latest phase of Israel’s genocidal campaign in Gaza.Immediately after 7 October, Israeli leaders, politicians, commanders and soldiers repeatedly said that they woulddestroy, burn and flatten Gaza. And they proceeded to do just that:Israel has effectively destroyed 90% of the Gaza Strip, turned it into a wasteland, andcrammed the population into 12% of the territory, throwing them into dire humanitarian conditions that are unfit for human survival. By besieging and bombarding the territory, Israel has left no safe place for civilians and no way out of Gaza. An attack on the remaining concentrations of population in Gaza City or Deir al-Balah or al-Mawasi will mean more massacres, more mass displacement, and inflicting on the remaining desperate and starving population conditions that will lead to their physical destruction.What is Israel’s end game? Israel says that theoccupation of Gaza will be “temporary”. But by now we are familiar with the Orwellian rhetoric that conceals reality and true intentions. We know that before, in 1967, Israel started a “temporary occupation” of Palestinian and Syrian lands. It has become permanent. This is why the ICJ declared in July 2024 that Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza is illegal and violates basic and fundamental norms in international law, including the prohibition of acquisition of territory through force, the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and the prohibition on apartheid or racial segregation.According to the ICJ, Israel already occupiedGazaeven before 7 October 2023, thereby depriving Palestinians of freedom in their own homeland. This means that intent to “fully occupy” Gaza in August 2025 can only be a euphemism for something else in the context of this genocide.It means Israel is pursuing the messianic fantasy and the criminal enterprise ofa “Greater Israel”, with the goal of “maximum land, and minimum Arabs”. This goal is also clear in the continuing forcible displacements in the West Bank and the calls to “resettle” Gaza. Benjamin Netanyahu is not seeking to free Gaza from Hamas, he is seeking to empty Gaza of its Palestinian population. Already in early January 2024, the UN said that Gaza has become uninhabitable. In early November 2024, Israel’s former minister of defence, Yoav Gallant,who is wanted by the international criminal court, reportedly said that there wasnothing left for the army to do in Gaza. If so, what has the Israeli army been doing in Gaza since then?1:11'We will pursue you everywhere': hostage families warn Netanyahu against Gaza offensive – videoIsrael’s intentions are clear. In January 2024, Netanyahu, another fugitive of international justice, doubled down on his longstanding rejection of Palestinian statehood, and an overwhelming majority in the Knessetsupported his positionin July 2024. In April 2024, the UNrebuked Israel for expanding the “buffer zones” in Gazabecause it meant the permanent removal of the population.In May 2025,according to the Times of Israel, Netanyahu said that Israel was destroying homes in Gaza so that Palestinians would have nowhere to go back to and would be forced to leave their homeland. In July 2025, the current minister of defence, Israel Katz, announced a plan forthe ruins of Rafahthat was compared to a “concentration camp” by former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert. In recent months, the main Israeli activity in Gaza has been the systematic demolition of buildings by well-paid civilian contractors.In light of this, you understand the true meaning of Netanyahu’s statement that “Gaza” (rather than Hamas) “will not be a threat”, and why the recent cabinet decision would reject a role for the compliant Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority in Gaza. This is not about Hamas, nor about military objectives, nor about the hostages whose release Netanyahu has systematically sabotaged. Rather, this is a genocidal campaign that continues the denial of Palestinian freedom andseeks to impose Jewish supremacy, from the river to the sea.My years reporting on Gaza broke me down. Why did it take so long for the world to become outraged? | Phoebe GreenwoodRead moreAs Israel promises further escalation, it is fulfilling Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich’s, monstrous promise in April 2024 of “total annihilation”. For decades, the west has failed the test of human rights and international law, as Israel has increased the brutality of its occupation and consolidated its apartheid regime over the Palestinian people. Western states such as the UK will not be able to wash their hands from complicity in Israel’s mass atrocities in the past two years. By granting Israel impunity from accountability and by arming this rogue state, the west has enabled these atrocities. Recent declarations about recognition of a Palestinian state are a publicity stunt and a distraction that conceals this impunity but highlights the lack of action.It is beyond urgent, and legally and morally required, that all states take immediate and meaningful actions to stop Israel, including sanctions, arms embargos, the suspension of trade and diplomatic relations, and support the international courts to bring Israeli criminals to justice. Unless action is taken, Gaza – as Smotrich monstrously put it in May 2025 – “will be destroyed”.

Both women were formidable – and absolutely terrifyingZoe WilliamsSo many of the tributes of the late Blue Peter producer are synonyms for ‘scary’, which from the 60s to the 80s was what many people thought of professionals who happened to be womenMon 11 Aug 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 21.31 EDTShareDavid Attenborough’s description of Biddy Baxter, when he presented her in 2013 with a special Bafta for her 25 years’ work on Blue Peter, was easily the best: dedicated, passionate and pioneering. But since theproducer has died, at 92, and other reminiscences have poured in, you can’t help but notice how many of them are synonyms for “scary”.“Producer” and “creator” describe Baxter’s work onBlue Peter, but don’t convey how totally and utterly everything was her idea: from Tony Hart to the Blue Peter badges, from the golden retrievers to the Blue Peter garden, from “here’s one we made earlier” to the charity appeals, she conjured it all, to make a cultural artefact that left no child untouched. If you ever received a Blue Peter badge, it’s odds on you still have it – and, if it’s a gold one, that you still talk about it.View image in fullscreenBiddy Baxter, the editor of Blue Peter, in 1968.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesMy mum worked on Blue Peter as a set designer, on and off, over the same period and was always using words such as “formidable”, “uncompromising” and “takes no prisoners” about Baxter. It made no sense to me as a kid, because my mum was terrifying at work. She revelled in how scary she was, how she could make fully grown carpenters quake with one eyebrow. How could there be two of them? Surely that would cause some kind of chemical reaction? Also, my mum didn’t prize the “feminine” traits of amiability and compliance, so why did she sound faintly critical when they were void in other women?They were different brands of scary: Baxter was stilettos-on-the-studio-floor scary; my mum was dungarees-and-cigs scary. Baxter kept presenters in their place by insisting the real stars were the Blue Peter pets, while the entire design department (if memory serves) acted like neither pets nor people held any meaning at all, compared with a scale model of an aquarium made of balsa wood and sticky-back plastic.But still, you would have expected maybe a trace of solidarity, a collective “in fact, neither of us is frightening in any true sense, we’re just professionals with strong views who happen to be women”. I didn’t see any of that, which speaks to Attenborough’s point about pioneers: if you’re ever wearing stilettos at work and telling people what to do without striking terror into anyone, it’s because Baxter and her ilk, from the 60s through the 80s, were the ones they made earlier.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

On a matter also fundamental to its own security, Europe must assert itselfMon 11 Aug 2025 13.46 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 16.49 EDTShareIn recent weeks, as Russia continued its assault on Ukraine in frank disregard of White House deadlines and demands, there was hope in Kyiv and European capitals that the scales might finally be falling from Donald Trump’s eyes. Last month, Mr Trumpnotedthat although his conversations with Vladimir Putin repeatedly led him to believe that a ceasefire deal was in reach, the Russian president then routinely went on to “knock down a building in Kyiv”. More bluntly, he hasaccusedMr Putin of stringing him along with “bullshit”.It was ostensibly on those grounds that the US president set an 8 Augustdeadlinefor Mr Putin to agree to a peace deal with Ukraine, on pain of “significant” sanctions. Yet instead of being punished for ignoring this injunction too, Mr Putin has been rewarded with asummitwith Mr Trump in the United States, and apparently allowed to veto any suggestion that Volodymyr Zelenskyy should also attend.Suddenly, and alarmingly, it feels a little like February again, when Mr Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance,treatedMr Zelenskyy with outrageous disrespect in the White House, and appeared disposed to pursuing a peace agreement on Mr Putin’s terms. There are conflicting accounts ofdiscussionsbetween Mr Putin and the US presidential envoy, Steve Witkoff, last week. But there is no evidence that Mr Putin has any intention of compromising on his maximalist goals in Ukraine, including the annexation of eastern regions, demilitarisation and the abandoning of Ukraine’s aspiration to Nato membership.Morally and practically speaking, the Ukrainian president’s absence on Friday will mean that any “deal” struck by Mr Trump and Mr Putin in Alaska lacks all legitimacy. But Kyiv understandably fears a carve-up in whichUkraineis pressured by Washington and Moscow to unilaterally surrender land in its east, and make other concessions, in exchange for a pause in the fighting.This would be, of course, to reward Mr Putin’s illegal invasion and betray a nation whose fate is tied up with Europe’s security as a whole. The very fact of Friday’s summit, from which European leaders are also excluded, is already a wholly unearned diplomatic win for Mr Putin. Mr Trump is driven by mercantilism and ego: he may be persuaded that if Ukraine could be bullied into accepting the unacceptable,opportunitiesrelating to Russian oil and gas could be unleashed, and the Nobel peace prize he covets become a genuine possibility.After frantic mediation, it emerged on Monday that Mr Zelenskyy and European leaders may take part in a joint call with Mr Trump on Wednesday. The Ukrainian president hasalreadymade it clear that there will be no concession of further territory to Russia’s occupying forces. In the lead-up to Alaska, and afterwards, Europe must ensure that his words are lent weight by a unified and robust stance on what would constitute a just peace, as opposed to one imposed against Ukraine’s will.Ultimately, that will need to include credible security guarantees for Kyiv fromEuropeand the US, and an agreed sanctions regime to be enacted should Russia renege on its commitments. But the first priority must be pressuring Mr Putin to agree to a ceasefire immediately in order that meaningful negotiations can begin. Until last week, that appeared to be the approach Mr Trump had decided to adopt. It was the right one.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s more complicated and more exciting. It’s a constant process of exploration. An adventure into the unknown. Scientists come up with theories about what might be going on, and then test them. They don’t always get it right. Far from it. But inch by inch, testing, failing and trying again, they make progress.Robert F Kennedy Jr, during Senate confirmationhearingsfor the role of secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), seemed to get that. Those who feared what a vaccine sceptic might do in that role breathed again. “I’m going to empower the scientists at HHS to do their job and make sure that we have good science that is evidence based … I’m not going to substitute my judgment for science,” he said.Yet now, without good explanation or sound science, he iscutting$500m of research funding for mRNA vaccines, claiming that they “fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like Covid and flu”. In fact, no Covid vaccine fully protects against infection, but they have been shown to prevent deaths in billions of people. The 22 contracts that will be cancelled include one with Moderna for a vaccine against bird flu, which manyfearcould trigger the next human pandemic (and there will be one). Instead, federal funds will go to vaccines developed in more traditional ways.Either Mr Kennedy lied to Congress or he has a different understanding of science and evidence from most scientists, unpicking what they thought was uncontestable. The childhood vaccine schedule is being reconsidered, andmandatingthe measles vaccine is being questioned in spite of fatal outbreaks in the US. He has sacked the Centers for Disease Control vaccine advisory panel and replaced it with many people known to have sceptical views.Mr Kennedy is particularly hostile to the mRNA vaccines against Covid-19,panningthem in 2021 as the “deadliest vaccines in history”, wrongly claiming that half those suffering the rare side-effect of myocarditis would die or need heart transplants within five years. The vast majority have quickly recovered. Until 2023, he chaired an anti-vaccine organisation called Children’s Health Defense, where he petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to rescind the licence of all Covid-19 vaccines andcomparedmandating vaccines to Nazi oppression in the second world war.This is the stuff of internet scares; labyrinthine tangles of misinformation dotted with odd inaccurate nuggets of quasi-science. It doesn’t compare with the evidence base for mRNA vaccines, which went through clinical trials on hundreds of thousands of people and have since been used to vaccinate billions.Experts agree that the mRNA vaccines were a stunning breakthrough that allowed people to be protected in record time from Covid-19. They contain messenger RNA, a tiny bit of genetic code that teaches the immune system to fight the virus. No need to grow the virus in hen’s eggs, which takes months. The “plug and play” technology can be adapted against other viruses, such as flu, including some that devastate populations in poor countries. The inventorswon the Nobel prize in 2023.Mr Kennedy’s cancellation of funding not only stymies much research but also feeds worldwide doubt in mRNA vaccines. We are all the losers. Humanity needs these vaccines. Other countries need to step up with money and reassurance to try to heal this latest breach between science and nonsense. And Mr Kennedy is clearly unfit for the job he holds.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Tax it properly – and turbocharge the fight against child poverty, 6 August). This policy supports our shared goals of delivering sustainable public finances alongside improved public health outcomes as well as the government’s manifesto pledges to reduce gambling-related harms and alleviate child poverty.This £11.5bn sector benefits enormously from VAT exemptions and pays just 21% tax – far below the35%-57% rateselsewhere in western Europe and the US. By contrast, other harmful products like cigarettes and alcohol are taxed at up to 80%. At the same time, gambling leads to harms that cost the NHS and other serviceswell over £1bna year.The government must not be swayed by intensive lobbying and false claims of economic harm or the threat of illegal gambling from the gambling industry, which will of course resist these proposals.Instead, ahead of the child poverty review, the government must seize the opportunity in the next budget to tax a social harm to pay for a social good.Alex Ballinger MPLabour, HalesowenDr Beccy Cooper MPLabour, Worthing WestThe raising of taxes should go hand in glove with a move towards a full advertising ban of gambling, like Gordon Brown’s government did with tobacco. The new customer incentives are obscene. You wouldn’t get away with offering new customers a free packet of cigarettes, and neither should gambling companies get away with similar cash offers.Of course, the gambling industry will resist, as did tobacco before it, but the sky did not fall on our heads and other advertisers were found to fill the gaps, as they always will be.William BartramHampton, LondonGordon Brown’s article makes no mention of horse racing, which is a totally different form of gambling to online slots and, if his ideas are applied, will enter a terminal death spiral of diminishing returns, as your own correspondentGreg Woodhas eloquently argued for years. By all means tax casinos and slots, but please exclude the one sport in which this country leads the world, not only in staging but also in competing.I also seem to recall that Brown was chancellor in the Blair government thatderegulated the gambling industry, thereby ensuring that our seaside resorts and city centres are now home to casinos and the many slot machine arcades that blight our high streets – a thoroughly regrettable development on every level.Brown’s proposals will have unintended consequences and do little to alleviate poverty.Tim HarrisonLondonIt is unfortunate that Gordon Brown fails to mention that Scotland is the only place in the UK wherechild poverty has fallenin recent years. This is due largely to the Scottish child payment of £27.15 a week per child to eligible families.This does not fully mitigate the effect of the two-child benefit cap, but is a good example of what small countries with constrained budgets can achieve. The UK government should be ashamed of its failure to learn fromScotlandand act more swiftly on reducing child poverty.Shelagh YoungEdinburghHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Photograph: Peter Byrne/PASquad will need to adapt quickly to Pep Guardiola’s evolutionary tactics, while a battle looms between James Trafford and Ederson for the No 1 jerseyByWill UnwinMon 11 Aug 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 19.23 EDTShareGuardian writers’ predicted position:3rd (NB: this is not necessarily Will Unwin’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Last season:3rdProspectsManchester City kitsPlenty of money, about £300m, has been spent over the past eight months to get City back on track after a disastrous season by their standards. They finished a distant third and lostthe FA Cup final, leaving them trophyless. The latest crop of incomings got a brief taste of life under Pep Guardiola at the Club World Cup and all showed promise. AfterRodri missed most of last season, it feels as if his fitness will decide the fate of the team. If Guardiola can get him back to his best – and keep him fit – after a horrible injury, then City can feel excited once again.Guardiola has indicated City need to adapt to the evolution of football, having struggled with the increase in physicality and fitness that has blunted their skills. There could be a greater emphasis on dribbling past opponents to try to open up the spaces. Rayan Cherki, Phil Foden, Jérémy Doku and Savinho will be extremely important in apost-Kevin De Bruyne world. City struggled more than ever when it came to breaking down teams last season and Guardiola felt his team were unable to cope with the physicality of others.It will be interesting to see who gets the nod in goal on the opening weekend. Ederson has been Guardiola’s No 1 for years, butthe arrival of James Traffordcould change that. The Brazilian has redefined the position and Trafford, a former City academy player, is part of a new generation who followed his strategy and have attempted to replicate his ability to distribute the ball short and long. Trafford is young and not the finished article, but he has all the qualities to be a world-class goalkeeper for years to come.At the other end, Erling Haaland will be as dangerous as always, with fitness the only question mark hanging over him after some disruptions. Unlike this time last year, Guardiola has a second striker he can all upon if needs be in Omar Marmoush. The Egyptian was integral in reigniting City’s seasonafter arriving in Januaryand should be fully settled, giving them extra dimensions.Graph of Manchester City’s finishes in the past five seasonsThe managerPep Guardiola took last season personally, upset with himself for failing to arrest the slide and irritated by underperforming players. He will not accept a similar showing this season, especially after the sizable outlay on reshaping the squad. Guardiola overhauled his coaching staff, with the most eye-catching appointment being Jürgen Klopp’s former No 2 Pep Ljinders, who joins as an assistant coach. The change in personnel will bring new ideas, something Guardiola was seeking as he sought a refresh on the pitch and in the dugout.Off-field pictureThose pesky chargesjust will not go away for Manchester City and the Premier League. It feels as if this situation has dragged on since Adam was a lad and rivals will continue to use it as a stick to beat the club with, while City plead innocence and claim a witch-hunt. No one is satisfied with the state of affairs and everyone will want finality as soon as possible because it is a constant distraction. A freeze on ticket prices brought some goodwill after lengthy criticism of the club’s desire to squeeze every penny they could out of supporters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 21-year-old has been linked with top clubs since his teenage years, but City finally got their hands on Lyon’s attacking midfielder, who falls into the maverick category. He dribbles, creates and scores goals, while also possessing the ability to produce the unpredictable with the ball at his feet, and he can play in numerous positions behind a striker. It is hard to predict what he will do next, which will concern defenders. In an era when football is prescribed, Cherki can be the rule breaker.Stepping upA year ago, Oscar Bobb scoredin the Community Shieldto signal he was about to break out. He had enjoyed a great pre-season and Guardiola was confident in his qualities. The highly rated Bobb was the reason City werehappy to part with Cole Palmer, thinking they had someone who could surpass him in their ranks. Unfortunately for Bobb, he broke a leg in training and required a lengthy rehabilitation period, taking longer than anyone expected, meaning he made three Premier League appearances, all as a substitute. There is greater competition in the positions he wants to play, but given a chance he could be a star turn.Bar chart of Manchester City’s resultsA big season for …By his own admission, 2024-25 did not live up to Phil Foden’s high standards. Fromclaiming the Professional Footballers’ Association’s player of the yearaward for the previous season, Foden dropped off dramatically. He attributed the problems on the pitch to various factors, including facing challenges“off the pitch mentally”and it is understandable that those affected his ability to perform. The 25-year-old is a generational talent, possessing everything his manager wants in a player, and he will be desperate to show it. Given the correct freedom, he should be the man leading the latest incarnation of Guardiola’s football and a new era at City.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26Manchester CityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Parish had been confident that the club’s appeal against their demotion from the Europa League would succeed as he discussed their prospects at Wembley Stadium after beating Liverpool in the Community Shield on Sunday.“I really am, even more after Friday,” the club chair said. “I don’t understand that we cannot be in the competition. I really can’t. But it’s up to the judges to decide. We trust them and that they listened to everything we said so let’s see.”Crystal Palace keen to sell captain Marc Guéhi before transfer window closesRead moreConfirmation from the court of arbitration for sport that it had upheld the decision made by Uefa’s club financial control body to punish Palace for breaching its multi-club ownership rules has brought Parish and the team’s fans back to earth.The Cas statement made clear the role of John Textor, the American businessman who last month sold his 43% stake in Palace to the New York Jets owner, Woody Johnson, was decisive. Textor has admitted that seconds after Palace’s victoryagainst Manchester City in the FA Cup finalin May that he feared the worst regarding participation in the Europa League, given that he owns Lyon, who also qualified.The Cas panel – consisting of a Dutch former striker, a Swiss former fencer who competed in the 1984 Olympics, and an Italian professor – backed Uefa’s findings that Textor “was a board member with decisive influence over both clubs at the time of Uefa’s assessment date”. It also dismissed Palace’s argument that they had received unfair treatment compared to Nottingham Forest and Lyon, and said missing the 1 March deadline for Textor to place his shares into a blind trust had been crucial.Textor has been the target of most Palace fans’ frustration, although several have also taken aim at the Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis. Forest, who are poised to take Palace’s Europa League place, wrote to Uefa a few weeks after the FA Cup final expressing concern that Palace may have contravened multi-club ownership regulations.Parish suggestedlast month in an interview with Gary Lineker that their Premier League rivals had played a role in the decision to ban them. “We were told that and I think it’s been made public,” he said. “These things seem to be played out in public. There doesn’t seem to be a lot of confidentiality that comes out of certain organisations. But we’re led to believe that’s the issue – if there wasn’t somebody that wanted to get in as a consequence, then there wouldn’t be a problem.“People have got to look at themselves. Some people will say it’s fine, some people will say it’s not. I don’t really have control of that. I only have control of the arguments that we put forward to Uefa.” Forest declined to comment on Parish’s remarks at the time.View image in fullscreenMarc Guéhi at Wembley during Sunday’s win against Liverpool.Photograph: John Patrick Fletcher/Action Plus/ShutterstockPalace’s case is believed to have included evidence that only members of the European Club Association were informed Uefa’s 1 March deadline for complying with multi-club rules could be extended until 31 May – a fact that enabled Marinakis to place Forest into a blind trust when it seemed they might qualify for the Champions League along with his Greek club, Olympiakos.Palace are also understood to have highlighted the burgeoning friendship between Marinakis and Textor. The American denies that had any bearing on his conduct and described as untrue reports he is planning to incorporate his Brazilian club Botafogo into the Greek shipping magnate’s network of clubs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Marinakis has resumed control of shares in the two-time European champions after they finished seventh in the Premier League.Their supporters can look forward to the Europa League’s league stage while Palace prepare for a Conference League playoff against the losers of the Europa League qualifier between Norway’s Fredrikstad and Midtjylland. The Danish side lead 3-1 going into their home leg on Thursday.It is estimated demotion will cost Palace up to £20m in lost revenue, given the Conference League’s league stage has two fewer games than the Europa League’s, although Oliver Glasner will fancy his chances of winning a competition that has had two English winners in its first four editions.The chance for Palace to play in Europe for the first time since a short-lived Intertoto Cup experience in 1998, when they qualified after being the only English team to apply for entry, will be consolation for a club that also missed out in 1991 when they finished third in the First Division.

Instead of allowing her emotions to consume her, though, they inspired one of the most impressive performances of her career as she pushed Aryna Sabalenka, the best player in the world, to the edge of her limits in an epic three hour and nine minute scuffle before narrowly falling 7-6 (3), 4-6, 7-6 (5) in the third round of the Cincinnati Open.Recently, Raducanu has performed well against lower-ranked opponents but the gulf between her and the top players had been undeniable. Here, the 22-year-old proved to herself that she has enough quality to beat the best in the world.‘People see themselves in me’: Frances Tiafoe on being a tennis trailbazer in a mainly white sportRead moreHaving struggled with her serve throughout this year, including throughout the first set, this performance particularly underlined the progress she has made on her first serve. From a set down, Raducanu dragged herself back into the match with some of her best serving performances of the year as she breezed through her games and continually put pressure on Sabalenka. In the decisive moments, however, Raducanu did not always maintain her confidence behind it.During the exchanges, Raducanu chose her moments to attack with her forehand brilliantly, she absorbed Sabalenka’s pace effectively, defending well and mixing in her much improved backhand slice. Along with the effectiveness of her game, Raducanu’s resilience was admirable. This performance was a testament to her development as both a player and competitor.For her part, Sabalenka’s level was far from her best and her struggles were reflected in 72 unforced errors. But she has evolved into such an incredible, reliable competitor. Even when she struggled with her form, her error count continued to pile up and she was plainly being outplayed by Raducanu, she maintained her composure and continued to search for a way through.With the Belarusian men’s doubles legend Max Mirnyi a new addition to her team, Sabalenka showed her continued development by repeatedly approaching the net in decisive points deep in the final set. Sabalenka has become such a consistent player and she has learned how to find a path to victory regardless of her struggles. She has now, incredibly, won 16 tie-breaks in a row. Raducanu is not the first player to be outhustled by the No 1 in a tight match, and nor will she be the last.The players walked out onto Centre Court just before 1pm in stifling 32C heat and humid conditions that have presented a significant physical challenge. Although Raducanu was sharp at the beginning of a turbulent first set, winning the first nine points of the match, that hopeful early spell did not last. As the momentum wildly swung back and forth, they ended the set in a tie-break. While Sabalenka elevated her level under pressure, Raducanu lost all confidence in her second serve. After double faulting at 1-3, her shoulders slumped and she quickly found herself down a set.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka held her nerve in a third-set tie-break to defeat Emma Raducanu.Photograph: Daniel Kopatsch/Getty ImagesAlthough Raducanu was understandably deflated, her resilience was impressive. She bounced back immediately, opening the second set by finding brilliant rhythm on the serve. She finished the set having landed 82% of first serves while winning 75% behind it, which she complimented with an excellent return game at 3-3 against an increasingly erratic Sabalenka.Both players opted to take a bathroom break and briefly escape the humidity before the final set, but it was Raducanu who returned first. Her subsequent discussion withFrancisco Roig, her new coach, touched on many facets of her game, but he constantly repeated one particular message when giving his perspective on the match: “You’re better than her.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After 13 deuces and four break points across a game that lasted over 20 minutes, Raducanu found the strength to drag herself through the game with an unreturned serve and then she composed herself to force a final set tie-break.Even though she was far from her best and countless opportunities had passed her by, Sabalenka still found a way to produce her best tennis in the most important moments. She nervelessly closed an excellent, tight tussle with an ace.In the aftermath of her tight two-set match againstSabalenka at Wimbledon, the challenge for Raducanu was to maintain that momentum. She has consolidated it brilliantly with her performances across the North American hard court season, both playing and winning consistently, her confidence growing with each tournament.Once the pain from this excruciating defeat abates, this will only make her a better player. Four years on from thefortnight in New Yorkthat changed her life, Raducanu will head to the US Open in better form than she has been since then.Explore more on these topicsTennisEmma RaducanunewsShareReuse this content"

It will also greatly reduce the number of hated back-to-back fixtures.The 18 first-class counties voted through the change in line with the recommendations of the county-led men’s Domestic Playing programme review and in harmony with the wishes of the players’ union, the Professional Cricketers’ Association.The counties will be divided into three regional groups of six – with counties playing each other home and away, plus one home game and one away game against a county outside their group – giving each county an opportunity to play every other on a rolling basis.Attendance figures for the Blast have fallen sharply since a peak of 950,000 tickets sold in 2019, knocked first by Covid and then by the introduction of the Hundred in 2021. The review’s steering group, made up of six county chief executives, plus ECB and PCA representatives, believes that rejigging the fixtures alone will not be enough to reinvigorate the Blast and more innovative moves – such as the introduction of a central investment fund – will be needed.Where there has previously been widespread county opposition to any reduction in the number of lucrative Blast games, the Hundred windfall – non-Hundred-host counties are due to receive just over £24m, host counties £18m – has given the counties more wriggle room.There is not yet any agreement on the future of the County Championship, but the mood music suggests against any drastic change, despite the PCA’s plea that a reduction from 14 to 12 games is “the only reasonable option”. A decision will be made by the counties before the Championship resumes for three final rounds in September.The number of games in the top tier of the Women’s Blast competition will also fall from 14 to 12, as Yorkshire move up to Tier One, with each county playing six home and six away games. The Tier Two teams will come together into one group, playing each other home and away.Explore more on these topicsCricketVitality Blast T20newsShareReuse this content"

There isn’t anybody who has been watching English football for any period of time who hasn’t made the mistake of taking too seriously a conclusion drawn in the midst of the traditional curtain-raiser, giddy on the sight of Wembley in its pomp and the return of competitive club football from the summer wilderness.Any analysis has to be tempered. Teams are always works in progress, evolving and developing, but that is never truer than in early August with new signings adapting to their teammates and surroundings, and others shaking the summer from their legs. Things will change. But after Liverpool’s 2-2 draw with Crystal Palaceand subsequent defeat on penaltiesin the Community Shield, it can be said with a degree of certainty that their new signings have gelled better at the front of the pitch than the back.Premier League 2025-26 preview No 12: LiverpoolRead moreHugo Ekitiké, signed from Eintracht Frankfurt, and Florian Wirtz, signed from Bayer Leverkusen, had hugely encouraging debuts. Ekitiké and the attacking right-back Jeremie Frimpong, another from Leverkusen, both scored. ButLiverpoolwere shockingly, startlingly open at times, as they have been throughout pre-season – and it cost them the game.They are learning a new system, the 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 hybrid of last season yielding to a 4-2-3-1. It’s not a huge shift but Wirtz, as the most advanced of the triangle of central players between the centre-backs and the centre-forward, is very much a forward, whereas Dominik Szoboszlai, who tended to be the most advanced of the central midfield triangle last season, is an attacking midfielder. It’s not that Wirtz does not perform his defensive duties – he does, and is notably assiduous in doing so, a highly effective presser of the ball – it’s that he does so in slightly different positions.The expectation is that the midfield two in most games going forward, at least when Liverpool are not going to monopolise possession, will be Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister. Gravenberch was unavailable for the Community Shield after becoming a father on Saturday night, while Mac Allister is still regaining fitness and was restricted to the final 20 minutes. That led to Szoboszlai occupying a deeper role than usual alongside Curtis Jones, who made a convincing case for occupying the role more frequently with a controlled performance in which he completed all 53 of the passes he attempted. It was after he and Ekitiké were withdrawn that Palace began to mount concerted pressure.Coming to terms with an unfamiliar system without the two key cogs at the back of midfield, the area that was always likely to come under pressure with the change of formation, was far from ideal for Liverpool. They had looked entirely comfortable for the first 15 minutes but then a simple straight through-ball opened them up, Jean-Philippe Mateta played onside by at least one and possibly both full-backs as Virgil Van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté stepped up in the centre. Although Alisson made the initial save, Liverpool were still resetting as the ball was returned to the middle, leading to Van Dijk’s clumsy lunge on Mateta and the penalty that brought the first equaliser.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That was what led to the second equaliser: Van Dijk being drawn forward, leaving the gap into which Ismaïla Sarr burst to score. Clearly Gravenberch’s absence made a difference but nobody should think that his return will immediately solve the problems. The new shape means a different approach, with Liverpool adopting an aggressive man-to-man press that left space behind the defensive line. Sarr caused problems all game, repeatedly dragging Milos Kerkez, the fourth of the new signings in the starting lineup, infield, which meant Cody Gakpo had to do a lot of work tracking Palace’s right wing-back, Daniel Muñoz.None of this is unsolvable, but it does mean that Liverpool may be more defensively vulnerable, at least in the early part of the campaign, than they were in winning the league last season. Ekitiké had an excellent game, his movement and his touch, his awareness, all excellent. Wirtz impressed as well with his energy and invention; the penultimate pass he played in the buildup to the first goal demonstrating his capacity to see opportunities others would not, crafting a service to Ekitiké that took three Palace players out of the game.But for any side making as many changes as Liverpool have this summer, with four big new signings and a fifth perhaps to arrive inAlexander Isak, there will be a degree of uncertainty, a period of bedding in. The possibilities are exciting but, as Slot reshapes the squad to his own specifications, some teething troubles are only to be expected.On this day…View image in fullscreenPSG came into being 55 years ago today.Photograph: Every Second Media/AlamyParis Saint-Germainare by some margin the youngest of Europe’s giants, having come into being on 11 August 1970, a day after the birth of the former Manchester United and Ireland midfielder Roy Keane. The French capital had no major club which, as European competition became established through the 1960s, came to seem increasingly bizarre. So, in 1969, the French Football Federation, the mayor of Paris, the editor of French sports newspaper l’Équipe and Guy Crescent, who ran the Calberson truck company and was prepared to provide financing, got together to decide the best way of setting up a team for Paris. A referendum confirmed the scheme had overwhelming popularity, voting for the name Paris FC, and, in February 1970, a telethon attracted 10,000 people to sign up as members, each paying 20 francs.But Paris FC had no stadium, players, coach or licence, so a merger was arranged with the second-flight side Stade Saint-Germain, creating Paris Saint-Germain (Paris FC broke away in 1972 and, after promotion this past May, will compete again in the French top flight this season). After the fashion designer Daniel Hechter took over in 1973, redesigning the kit and providing investment, the club gained promotion to the top-flight, moving in to the Parc des Princes in 1974 as Paris FC were relegated.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

He is due to begin a medical on Monday.City are looking to recoup most of Grealish’s £300,000-a-week wages and Everton’s outlay could exceed £12m once a loan fee is accounted for. City also want to include an option for a permanent transfer, although a suggested price of £50m appears optimistic for a player who will be 30 and in the final year of his contract in 12 months.

The £100m signing from Aston Villa, who has had several offers to leave City this summer, missed out on the England squad for the 2024 European Championship after losing his regular first-team place under Pep Guardiola.The playmaker’s role has continued to decline since the high mark of City’s treble-winning season in 2023. He made seven Premier League starts last season, scoring once, and was omitted from Guardiola’s 27-man squad for the Club World Cup this summer.Moyes is desperate to inject more creativity into his side. Everton have made five signings, including Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall fromChelseafor £28m, but remain short of attacking options. Southampton have rejected three offers from Everton for Tyler Dibling, the latest at about £40m, and are holding out for about £50m. A right-sided forward is a priority for Moyes and Everton, who lost their fourth friendly of pre-season against Roma on Saturday, are considering alternative options to the 19-year-old.Nottingham Forest are closer to signing midfielder James McAtee from City.

McAtee had interest from Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, but was eager to stay in England.Forest are also keen to add a striker, full-back and central midfielder. Regarding midfielders they maintain interest in Monaco’s Soungoutou Magassa and Milan’s Yunus Musah, and Liverpool’s Kostas Tsimikas is a potential defensive reinforcement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Preliminary talks have been held over the 21-year-old, who joined City from Girona last summer. It is expected to take at least £50m for City to consider selling the Brazilian. Spurs are looking for attacking reinforcements after missing out on Nottingham Forest’sMorgan Gibbs-Whiteandlosing James Maddisonto a long-term knee injury.Any outgoings may be followed by City looking to strengthen their options in the final third. They are understood to be considering a hijack ofChelsea’s pursuit of RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons. Chelsea have held talks over the Netherlands international, but have not made progress on a fee and want to sell players before lodging a bid.The deadlock may open the door for City to move for Simons, who has also been linked with Bayern Munich. Chelsea have agreed personal terms with the versatile 22-year-old, but the situation is complicated by their desire to find buyers for Christopher Nkunku, Nicolas Jackson and Tyrique George before making additions.Chelsea have plenty of depth and are determined not to panic after the England defender Levi Colwill sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury. They have options in central defence and will try to sign a new centre-back only if a suitable player comes on to the market.Explore more on these topicsEvertonManchester CityTransfer windowPremier LeagueChelseaNottingham ForestnewsShareReuse this content"

The mouthguard will flash red if the impact is severe enough to potentially cause a concussion. The referee will then stop play and the player will go off for a head injury assessment.Lark Atkin-Davies doubles up in Red Roses’ power-packed win over FranceRead moreDr Lindsay Starling, a science and medical manager at World Rugby, said the new system would debut at the Women’s Rugby World Cup, which begins next week, before being rolled out across the men’s and women’s elite game. “Match officials and players will be able to see that this player has sustained a big head impact because their mouth guard is flashing red,” she said. “And it will create awareness about head injuries and concussions in the stands and for fans at home, being able to see it on TV.”Dr Éanna Falvey, the chief medical officer at World Rugby, said every player at the Women’s World Cup would be wearing the new mouthguards, apart from two who wear braces. He said that was significantly higher than for the men’s game, in which around 85% of players wearsmart mouthguards.He said he hoped all players would embrace the new technology. “It would be great for the game. But personal choice is an important thing, autonomy is an important thing.”The mouthguards work by measuring how much a player’s head moves up and down and rotates during a collision. When it registers an acceleration above 75g and 4,500 radians per second squared for men – and 65gs and 4,500 rad/s2 for women – it will start flashing.That is an improvement on the existing system, which uses Bluetooth to alert the match‑day doctor and can take several seconds to arrive.Starling also indicated that the mouthguards could help to identify foul play, but that there were caveats. “There is a world in which the data from the mouthguard can start to come into play a little bit more with foul play,” she said. “But what everybody needs to understand is that in the same way a player can get concussed from a pretty small head impact, foul play [can have occurred] without registering anything substantial.“What we need to be careful not to do is overrely on the data or put too much power in the hands of the data. Data is incredibly powerful, but in this case the data might not tell 100% of the picture.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But we’re working with the players to get them on board to want to share that information.“There is a very fine line between big and being safe and correct and the player being looked after.

The governing body said it was “perfectly normal”.The sportwas rocked in Marchby the discovery of illegally altered suits on the Norwegian team at the world championships. The International Ski Federation investigated officials and athletes over those changes that could help the wearer to soar through the air for longer thanks to the suit’s larger surface area.On Monday, the Olympic gold medal­lists Marius Lindvik and Johann André Forfang, and three staff members on the Norway men’s team, were charged with ethics violation as part of an investigation into “equipment manipulation”. Lindvik’s gold medal in the men’s normal hill event at the Trondheim world championships, and Norway’s bronze in the men’s team event on the large hill, are at risk.On Saturday at the first event of the 2025-26 season – a summer Grand Prix event on an artificial surface in France – six male ski ­jumpers were also disqualified because of suit issues such as waist size and three more were “not permitted to start”. Another jumper from Japan was blocked from competing as the Grand Prix continued on Sunday.The federation confirmed it is treating the spate of ­disqualifications as the natural result of tightening up the rules after the Norwegian suit scandal. The FIS race director, Sandro Pertile, said he did not think anyone was trying to cheat and that fewer ­disqualifications would occur as teams became accus­tomed to the rules. Making specia­lised ski jumping equipment is “a fairly complicated matter”, he said.View image in fullscreenNika Prevc prepares to jump at the Courchevel event.Photograph: Vianney Thibaut/NordicFocus/Getty Images“It’s perfectly normal for teams to need some time to adapt to the new situation after such comprehensive changes to the equipment regulations. Some cope with it straight away, others find it difficult at first,” Pertile said. “It’s also important to highlight that these disqualifications are clearly a result of technical inadequacies – there’s no sign whatsoever of ill intent from the teams.”The FIS indicated that a further nine men and five women did not ­compete after a “technical approval” process, though it was not clear if all of those cases involved their suits. Five of those 14 were on the USA team, which did not respond immediately to a request for comment.Among those disqualified on Satur­day was Norway’s Kristoffer Eriksen Sundal, who had previously beenprovisionally suspended this yearafter the world championships.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The federal takeover is expected to be in effect for 30 days, the White House confirmed to the Guardian.Speaking at a White House press conference on Monday, Trump said he was taking “a historic action to rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor and worse. This is liberation day in DC and we’re going to take our capital back.”He described Washington DC as “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world”, claiming its murder rate is higher than Bogotá or Mexico City, even thoughviolent crime is at a 30-year low.The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who was among officials joining Trump on the podium, said 800 national guard troops would take to the streets of Washington over the coming week. “They will be strong, they will be tough and they will stand with their law enforcement partners,” he said.Trump, who lost the presidential election in DC to Democrat Kamala Harris by 86 percentage points, added that he may send in the military “if needed”.By invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, the president is federalising DC’s Metropolitan police department for the first time in its history. He said he was declaring a public safety emergency and putting the police under the control of the attorney general, Pam Bondi.Trump vowed to allow police to “do whatever the hell they want” in the face of provocations. “That’s the only language they [alleged criminals] understand. They like to spit in the face of the police. You spit, and we hit, and they get hit real hard.”Section 740 requires the mayor, Muriel Bowser, to provide “such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate”, when the president determines that there are “special conditions” requiring it. The president can only exercise such control under the act for 30 days without Congress passing a law extending it.After the former General Services Administration staffer Edward Coristine – a 19-year-old on the so-called “department of government efficiency” team nicknamed “Big Balls” –appeared to have been attackedby a group of young people last week near his car, Trump began discussing a return to federal control of the city and the use of national guard to quell street crime.Washington DC was hit hard by the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic, recording more homicides in 2023 than in any year since 1997. At that time it was among thetop five homicide ratesin major population centres – those with more than a million residents – behind only Memphis in Tennessee, St Louis in Missouri and Baltimore in Maryland, according to the non-profit USAFacts.But violent crime in Washington DC has fallen sharply since 2023, shaking off the pandemic increases to reach a 30-year low on the day Trump took office, and has fallen 26% further this year according toweekly reportsfrom the Metropolitan police department. The change in crime rates is consistent with dramatic decreases in violence in large cities across the country.View image in fullscreenA demonstrator holds a sign during a protest near the White House.Photograph: Ken Cedeno/ReutersThe capital is much safer than it used to be. In 1991 it was brandedthe murder capital of the USwith the killing of 482 people. By last year the total number of homicides had fallen to 187. This year the rate is on course to be lower.Nonetheless, Trump ordered a range of federal law enforcement agencies to deploy on to DC streets over the weekend in a surge. About 450 officers from the United States Capitol police, the Federal Protective Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and other agencies were present into the city’s quadrants over the weekend.At the press conference on Monday morning, Trump painted a nightmarish portrait of a city “overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs and homeless people”.The DC attorney general, Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host onlyconfirmedto her role on 2 August, said she saw “too much violent crime being committed by young punks who think that they can get together in gangs and crews and beat the hell out of you or anyone else”.Pirro expressed her frustration with what she views as excessive leniency when it comes to the way juveniles are prosecuted. “I can’t arrest them. I can’t prosecute them,” she said. “They go to family court, and they get to do yoga and arts and crafts. Enough, it changes today.”Pirro called for changes to the law to allow a wider range of juvenile cases to be heard in adult court.Again taking to social media on Sunday, Trumpdemandedthat homeless residents of the capital leave, posting images of encampments ostensibly taken from his motorcade.“The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,” Trumpwroteon his Truth Social platform on Sunday morning, shortly after being driven from the White House to his golf club in Virginia. “We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.”Homelessness rates in the nation’s capital have also been falling, with the most recent point-in-time count showing a decrease from 2024.Trump orders homeless he passed en route to golf course to leave Washington DCRead moreMonday’s announcement by Trump, who pardoned his supporters who attacked the US Capitol in Washington on 6 January 2021, was criticised by Democrats and civil rights leaders.Eleanor Holmes Norton, a non-voting delegate representing DC in the House of Representatives, said the decision “is an historic assault on DC home rule, is a counterproductive, escalatory seizure of DC’s resources to use for purposes not supported by DC residents, and is more evidence of the urgent need to pass my DC statehood bill”.Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, said: “Trump is once again playing political games using service members and federal law enforcement officials. Trump doesn’t give a damn about keeping DC residents safe.“When rioters violently stormed the Capitol and there were repeated requests for the national guard, Trump failed to act. To add insult to injury, he released from jail those 1,500 violent insurrectionists who assaulted police officers and broke local and federal law.”Al Sharpton, the founder and president of the National Action Network, suggested that the intervention was motivated by a desire to distract from criticisms over the administration’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.“Donald Trump was inspired to take this disgusting, dangerous, and derogatory action solely out of self interest,” he said. “Let’s call the inspiration for this assault on a majority Black city for what it is: another bid to distract his angry, frustrated base over his administration’s handling of the Epstein files.”Later Muriel Bowser, the mayor of DC, who has pursued a non-confrontational relationship with Trump, described the intervention as “unsettling and unprecedented” but declined to criticise the president directly.“I’ve said before, and I’ll repeat, that I believe that the president’s view of DC is shaped by his Covid-era experience during his first term,” she told reporters.“It is true that those were more challenging times related to some issues. It is also true that we experienced a crime spike post-Covid but we worked quickly to put laws in place and tactics that got violent offenders off our streets, and gave our police officers more tools.”Bowser said her office plans to follow the law and cooperate with the federal government, though “I don’t want to minimise the intrusion on our autonomy”. She has requested a meeting with Bondi, who will temporarily oversee the Metropolitan police department.1:11Trump's takeover of police ‘unsettling and and unprecedented': Washington DC mayor – videoFlanked by Pamela Smith, the DC police chief, and other city officials, Bowser added: “While this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can’t say that, given some of the rhetoric of the past, we’re totally surprised. I can say to DC residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud.”Asked about Trump’s hint that he could deploy the US military if required, the mayor replied: “I think I speak for all Americans. We don‘t believe it is legal to use the American military against American citizens on American soil. I am not a lawyer, but I think that is a fairly widely held fact.”Meanwhile Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic minority leader in the House, described Trump as a “wannabe king” and argued his plan to “unleash the national guard on the city’s youth and homeless population has no basis in law and will put the safety of the people of our nation’s capital in danger”.He added: “We stand with the residents of the District of Columbia and reject this unjustified power grab as illegitimate.”Shrai Popat contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsWashington DCDonald TrumpUS policingTrump administrationUS crimeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the US president expressed frustration with Volodymyr Zelenskyy for putting conditions on such a potential agreement.During a news conference at the White House on Monday, Trump said he was frustrated with Zelenskyy’s insistence thatUkrainewould need to hold a national referendum on any peace deal that stipulated recognising Russian control over territory that it has occupied during the war.“I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelenskyy was saying I have to get constitutional approval,” Trump said. “He has approval to go to war and kill everybody but he needs approval to do a land swap. Because there will be some land swapping going on. I know that throughRussiaand through conversations with everybody.”European diplomats have been taken aback by the lack of clarity on the US side about the territories Putin is demanding from Ukraine and the terms of a ceasefire. The discrepancies within the US reporting back on what Russia is seeking has alarmed European diplomats and only added to a fear that Trump, inflating his personal relationship with Putin, could make damaging concessions.Describing his vision for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said an agreement would include “good stuff, not bad stuff, also some bad stuff for both”. “We’re going to change the lines, the battle lines,” he added.Trump,increasingly impatientwith Putin in recent months, has long said he does not see a ceasefire occurring until he meets the Russian leader in person.The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, on Monday invited Trump to join emergency virtual talks with EU leaders and Zelenskyy on Wednesday, as European demands grow for the US president to agree red lines before Friday’s summit with Putin.Neither Zelenskyy nor European leaders have been invited to Trump’s meeting with the Russian president.Trump said on Monday that he would seek to arrange direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy, a proposal that the Russian president has rejected so far.“The next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and Putin, or Zelenskyy and Putin and me. I’ll be there if they need, but I want to have a meeting set up between the two leaders,” Trump said.He said a deal may not be possible and that he saw the upcoming summit as a “feel-out meeting”, and that he would update Zelenskyy and European leaders if Putin proposed a “fair deal”. “I’ll call him after and I may say lots of luck, keep fighting, or I may say we can make a deal,” he said.Merz’s office said in a statement that the virtual talks would focus on “further options for action to put pressure on Russia” and “preparations for possible peace negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security”.It is not clear whether or not Trump has accepted the invitation to the call.EU foreign ministers were meeting in an emergency session to underscore the demand. The UK has also been pressing for wider consultations after Trump unilaterally announced last week that he was going ahead with his first meeting with Putin since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.European leaderssay Russia represents an existential threat to the continent and that they should not be excluded from the process. Issues such as the terms of a ceasefire, further sanction pressure on Russia, any proposed territorial swaps and security guarantees for Ukraine would be discussed with the US president in the virtual meeting.There is concern that an unpredictable Trump will be lured into making fatal concessions to Putin, and the meeting would be a chance for him to map out his strategy.The Polish prime minister,Donald Tusk, said he was optimistic that the US president would formally consult European leaders before his meeting, and said the summit between Trump and Putin filled him with hope and fear.Mutual inconvenience: why Alaska for the Trump-Putin summit on Ukraine?Read moreBrussels’ top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said: “President Trump is right to say that Russia must end its war against Ukraine. The United States has the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously.” But she added: “Any agreement between the United States and Russia must include Ukraine and the EU because it is a security issue for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe.”Radosław Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, also asserted Europe’s relevance, saying: “Europe is paying for Ukraine to defend itself and we are sustaining the Ukrainian state. This is a matter of existential European security interests. We appreciate President Trump’s efforts but we will be taking our own decisions here in Europe. To get to a fair peace, Russia has to limit its war aims.”The White House is insisting that theAlaskameeting is to gauge whether Putin is willing to make concessions for peace, including on accepting western security guarantees for Ukraine, an acceptance that would acknowledge the long-term legitimacy of the Kyiv government led by Zelenskyy.Merz spoke with Trump on Sunday night to underline that he would prefer the US to impose further economic sanctions on Moscow before the talks. He also said he assumed Zelenskyy would be involved in any talks, but for Moscow it would be a concession for a Russian delegation to hold talks with the Ukrainian president since its invasion is predicated on not recognising the legitimacy of the government.A joint statement on Saturday from the leaders from France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Britain, Finland and the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, urged Trump to put more pressure on Russia and stressed: “The path in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.”Putin will go into Friday’s talks believing he is making progress on the battlefield, Trump is desperate for a settlement and the Ukrainian people are also increasingly willing to make concessions for peace. But the Russian president also knows that if he makes no substantive offer, Trump will be under real political pressure to go ahead with long-promised broader economic sanctions against Russia.Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator behind a congressional plan to impose secondary sanctions on countries that trade with Russia, expressed confidence that Trump would protect Ukraine’s interests at the summit. He was involved in the weekend diplomacy and is trusted as an intermediary with Trump by Ukrainian officials.He said if Putin did not offer concessions, he expected Trump to make countries importing Russian oil pay a heavy price, adding that this applied not just to India but also to China and Brazil. India is already due to face50% tariffs later this month.Speaking on NBC, Graham said: “Militarily, we need to keep Ukraine strong, keep flowing them strong and modern weapons, and security guarantees with European forces on the ground as tripwires to prevent a third [Russian] invasion. We want to end this with the sovereign, independent, self-governing Ukraine, and a situation where Putin cannot do this the third time without being crushed.”He added: “I want to be honest with you, Ukraine is not going to evict every Russian, and Russia is not going to Kyiv, so there will be some land swaps at the end.”Ukraine’s leadership has long said that de facto it will not recover all the territory it has lost in successive Russian invasions, but with European support it is fiercely resisting a Russian demand that it should hand over territory in the Donetsk region it has not yet ceded on the battlefield, especially if there are no security guarantees for Ukraine or compensating land swaps by Russia.Europeans are insisting that no limitations can be imposed on Ukraine developing its own military capabilities or the support it receives from third countries, including some inside Nato.Explore more on these topicsUkraineDonald TrumpRussiaVladimir PutinEuropeAlaskaDonald TusknewsShareReuse this content"

The process also removes carbon from the atmosphere, making it a useful carbon sink.The study estimated that biochar made from solid human excrement could provide up to 7% of the phosphorus used around the world each year. Although the biochar process converts only solids, nutrients taken from urine could be added to it, and the researchers found this could provide for 15% of annual phosphorus application, 17% of nitrogen, and up to 25% of potassium.Treated sewage sludge is already spread on farmland,but its use is controversialas it often contains microplastics, heavy metals, Pfas forever chemicals, pathogens, and pharmaceuticals.The researchers say biochar can avoid this problem by separating the waste at source.The study estimated that the biochar process could decrease both the weight and volume of solid excrement by up to 90%, which represents a significant gain in efficiency when compared with transporting sewage sludge, due to the latter’s high water content.The biochar production process also allows nutrient proportions to be adjusted according to the needs of individual crops. This can address problems associated with fertiliser use such as weed growth and eutrophication – when excess nutrients leach into groundwater, causing rapid growth of algae which depletes oxygen availability and reduces the sunlight available for underwater ecosystems.Dr Johannes Lehmann, a professor of soil biogeochemistry at Cornell University and lead author ofthe study published in the journal PNAS, said: “Talking about sewage is not as glamorous as renewable energy, but preventing resource wastage by creating a circular economy is also key to the green transition.”Agriculture accounts for 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. As demand has increased on global agricultural systems to provide enough food for all, so too has its appetite for fertiliser to replenish soil nutrients.Synthetic fertilisers deliver three main nutrients to soils – nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus – and all three involve energy-intensive and often environmentally destructive production processes. Nitrogen is fixed from the air to make ammonia via the Haber process, and turning this into nitrogen fertilisers emits an estimated 2.6 billion gigatonnes of CO2 a year – more than global aviation and shipping combined.Strip mining phosphate rock for phosphorus permanently scars natural landscapes and processing it into fertiliser also leads to radioactive phosphogypsum as a byproduct. Potash mining for potassium contributes to soil salinisation and freshwater contamination due to its large amounts of waste salt byproduct.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

As finite mineral resources become more scarce, countries without significant reserves could become dependent on those with for their agricultural needs and food security. For example, Morocco holds 70% of the entire world’s reserves of phosphates.“Instead, an alternative future where nutrients are recycled through a circular economy could empower countries to produce food without relying on imported fertilisers, redressing issues of environmental justice across the global south by potentially mitigating climate migration, one of the main drivers of which is agricultural failure.”Explore more on these topicsAgricultureGreenhouse gas emissionsFarmingClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Boyne, who was longlisted for the main Polari book prize for his novella Earth, is best known for his 2006 novel The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas.Author Nicola Dinan, who won the Polari first book prize last year for her novel Bellies, resigned from this year’s jury for the debut prize. Guardian journalist Jason Okundaye asked for his bookRevolutionary Actsto be removed from this year’s first book prize longlist, whileAndrew McMillan withdrew his book Pityfrom the longlist for the overall Polari book prize for non-debuts.Heartstopper author Alice Oseman along with the writers Nikesh Shukla, Julia Armfield, Naoise Dolan, Seán Hewitt and Kirsty Logan are among the hundreds to have signed the statement.“We are profoundly disappointed by the Polari prize’s decision to include John Boyne on the longlist for this year’s Polari book prize,” it reads. Boyne “has publicly and unequivocally associated himself with trans exclusionary sentiments”, it continues, citing anIrish Independent articlein which Boyne expresses support for JK Rowling and describes himself as a “fellow Terf”. Boyne declined to comment.Boyne’s “public statements on trans rights and identity are incompatible with the LGBTQ+ community’s most basic standards of inclusion”, the statement continues. “In any year, the decision to include Mr Boyne on the longlist would be, in our view, inappropriate and hurtful to the wider community of LGBTQ+ readers and writers. That the decision has been made this year – in the context of rising anti-trans hatred and systematic exclusion of trans people from public life in the UK and across the world – is inexcusable.”Today’s statement was drafted in response to one madeby the Polari prizeon 7 August. “It is inevitable given the challenges we face and the diversity of the lived experience we now represent under the LGBTQ+ Polari umbrella, that even within our community, we can at times hold radically different positions on substantive issues,” it says. “This is one of those times.”In a statement to the Guardian on Monday, the Polari prize added that the “past few weeks have been extremely difficult for the trans and non-binary writers and communities” associated with the award. “The hurt and anger caused has been a matter of deep concern to everyone associated with the prize, for which we sincerely apologise. We accept and respect the decisions of those writers and judges who have chosen to withdraw.”“Despite these events, we are committed to going forward with the prize this year. However, we will be undertaking a full review of the prize processes, consulting representatives from across the community ahead of next year’s awards, taking on board the learnings from this year.”The Polari prize was founded by journalist Paul Burston in 2011. The longlists for this year’s prize were published on 1 August, with the shortlists due to be announced in late September and the winners on 27 November.The statement in response, which garnered 821 signatures, was organised by the writers Niamh Ní Mhaoileoin and Emma van Straaten. “We want there to be a literary prize that recognises the vital importance of queer and trans stories,” it concludes. “That’s why we’re calling on the Polari prize to formally remove Mr Boyne from the longlist, to restore the integrity of this prize as a safe, inclusive and celebratory space for the LGBTQ+ community.”Other signatories include the writers Nussaibah Younis, Poorna Bell, Daisy Buchanan, K Patrick and Lex Croucher.Explore more on these topicsBooksJohn BoyneAwards and prizesSexualityTransgendernewsShareReuse this content"

It consists of garden-variety summary testimony by two law enforcement agents.”Brad Edwards, a Florida lawyer who has represented nearly two dozen Epstein accusers, told the Associated Press that he did not disagree with the the Engelmayer’s ruling Monday.“Our only concern was that if materials were released, then maximum protection for the victims was essential,” he said. “The grand jury materials contain very little in the way of evidentiary value anyway.”Trump’s administration had requested the release of grand jury transcripts in July amid intense political heat around the investigation of Epstein – the late financier and convicted pedophile – and his co-conspirator Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence.Members of the president’s Republican party joined the calls for his administration to resolve questions about the scandal, some of which center on him.Maxwell recently was interviewed by the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, and soon after was moved from a prison in Florida to a lower security prison in Texas, prompting accusations that a cover-up of evidence linking Epstein to Trump was in progress.An attorney for Maxwell says she spoke truthfully to Blanche. The lead prosecutor in the 2022 case against Maxwell, Maurene Comey, was dismissed from the southern district ofNew Yorkfederal prosecutor’s office before the interview took place.The request to unseal the testimony has been seen as an incremental measure: the government has acknowledged they contain no testimony from witnesses who weren’t members of law enforcement.But thousands of other documents and electronic files are in the government’s possession. In early July, the US justice department and FBI released a memo stating they found no evidence of an Epstein “client list” or blackmail – and that no further materials would be released to protect victims.Yet the fight over Epstein-Maxwell grand jury testimony is not complete. A federal judge in Florida is looking at releasing transcripts from the grand jury testimony that led to an earlier federal indictment against Epstein – from 2006 – that was later shelved.To resolve that case, Epstein pleaded guilty to Florida state charges of soliciting minors and entered into a non-prosecution agreement to protect himself and four named others from future prosecution. Maxwell has appealed her conviction to the US supreme court, claiming she should have been shielded under that earlier agreement.But a number of avenues remain open. The Republican-led House oversight committee has subpoenaed the justice department and issued subpoenas to Bill Clinton, ex-secretary of state and Hillary Clinton – whom Trump defeated in 2016 to secure his first presidency – and eight former top law enforcement officials to appear before the committee in the fall.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationNew YorkGhislaine MaxwellJeffrey EpsteinUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The length of the largest and most endangered freshwater giants, some as big as grizzly bears, decreased by 40% in seven years.Some fish, like the Mekong giant catfish, have been studied for over a longer period and show a decline in weight of 55% in the past 25 years, dropping from an average of 180kg (397lb) to 80kg.One of the study team, the biologist Ngor Peng Bun, helped catch a gigantic catfish in 2000 that weighed 270kg, before tagging and releasing it. “It was enormous – unforgettable,” he said, and nearly capsized his boat.

Both species are critically endangered.Size is a matter of survival because large fish – which are more likely to be caught – produce exponentially more eggs, the scientists said. A 300kg catfish can produce 10 to 20 times more offspring than a 50kg fish, for example. Many of the largest species are also long-lived and slow to mature, meaning increases in deaths can tip the balance towards population collapse.The Mekong giants are crucial for the river’s ecosystem but also central to the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on fishing. The scientists did find a sign of hope when in 2022 a fisher caught and released a record-breaking 300kg stingray. It was thelargest freshwater fish ever seenand showed that some giants still remain.View image in fullscreenA giant freshwater stingray, weighing 181kg, is caught and released in the Mekong in Cambodia.Photograph: Chhut Chheana/Wonders of the Mekong/AFP/Getty ImagesFishing and huntingoften targets the largest animalsand has led to the shrinking of many species includingcod in the Baltic Sea,salmon in Alaskaandsharks, and has led tosmaller tusks in African elephants.Dr Zeb Hogan, a research associate professor at the University of Nevada, US, and part of the study team, said the rapid shrinking of the Mekong megafish was surprising and shocking.“We’ve seen this pattern in the Atlantic cod fishery, where decades of size-selective fishing removed the largest, most fertile fish, resulting in a dramatic collapse. As body size and reproductive capacity decline, [the Mekong] fish risk entering a ‘death spiral’, in which populations persist but are no longer viable,” Hogan said.Sophorn Uy, at the Royal University of Agriculture in Phnom Penh and also part of the team, said: “Knowing these giants are shrinking, both in size and number, is like losing a small piece of Cambodia itself. Their existence carries deep cultural and ecological significance.”The study, which ispublished in the journal Biological Conservation, analysed seven years of monitoring data from 23 sites in the lower Mekong basin and included 257 species of fish. Full data was available from 2007-14. Hogan said the shrinking trend was likely to have continued.View image in fullscreenAs well as overfishing, the Mekong megafish are struggling with dams, which block their migration to spawning grounds.Photograph: Andy Eames/APAs well as overfishing, the Mekong megafish are struggling with dams, which block their migration to spawning grounds; the climate crisis, which is upsetting the seasonal triggers of temperature and rainfall; and the destruction of seasonally flooded forests for farming, which are an important habitat.Hogan said: “That 300kg stingray showed us that it’s not too late. New records are still being set. But they will mean little unless we act now to protect these species and the river system they call home. The future of the Mekong’s giants hangs in the balance.”The stingray was tagged and tracked for two years, which it spent in a protected area along a 3-mile (5km) stretch of river. “Connectivity [along rivers] and protected habitat – that’s the holy grail,” said Hogan. “If you have those, then these fish can survive.”Catching the megafish is already illegal in some countries through which the Mekong flows, but enforcement remains a big challenge, the scientists said. “Local fishers were essential to gathering our data,” said Sophorn. “They are on the frontlines and must be part of the solution.”Explore more on these topicsFishRiversFishingWildlifeAsia PacificConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

TheSwiss village of Blattenwas wiped out by a rock and ice avalanche in May and last year a mountain lake swollen by heavy rainfall caused torrential flooding in La Bérarde in the Isère, forcing inhabitants to flee the hamlet. They have not returned.View image in fullscreenPralognan-la-Vanoise, France.Photograph: Kim Willsher/The GuardianToday, an engineering operation is under way to prevent such a catastrophic scenario in Pralognan. Three workers have been helicoptered to the Grand Marchet glacier at an altitude of 2,900 metres to gouge a narrow, 6-metre deep, 100-metre long “overflow channel” in the ice. This will channel water from the lake into the cascades that feed streams of crystalline blue water flowing through Pralognan.“The aim is to help the water find its way down the mountain gradually and avoid a rapid emptying of the lake,” said David Binet, the director of the mountain land restoration service (RTM) for the northern Alps, part of the national forestry commission tasked with identifying and preventing natural hazards.“What causes the problems and damage with torrents in the mountains is not the water but the stones, gravel, sand and even large rocks it brings down with it.”The glacier blocks the lake from spilling down the mountain but it is shrinking at a rate of 2 to 3 metres a year. There is also the risk that that the warmer waters of the lake could form a channel gush from underneath.Binet said his agency was examining 300 of the estimated 600 lakes in the Alps and Pyrenees one by one for such hazards. The Pralognan operation will cost about €400,000 (£350,000) and should be finished by the end of summer.The idea of taking mechanical shovels to glaciers already shrinking at an alarming rate was deemed the least environmentally damaging option. Olivier Gagliardini, a glacier expert at Grenoble University, described it as “unfortunate, but necessary”.Martine Blanc, the mayor of Pralognan, said the decision to carry out the work was taken by her and the Savoie prefecture, the local state authority, after scientists examined the glacier and defined the risk.“We asked ourselves could it wait but on the principle that prevention is better than cure we decided to go ahead,” she said. “We decided to anticipate events rather than suffer them. Nature is nature and there’s no such thing as zero risk.”Most controversial was closing the municipal camping site, next to a cascade that runs into the village, in case the work provoked a surge of water, she said. “It was a matter of public safety, which is my absolute priority,” she added.Local shopkeepers say the number of tourists and hikers this summer is down, possibly because the campsite is closed, but Silvere Bonnet, the director of the tourist office, said he had had very few calls from potential visitors concerned about the lake.View image in fullscreenMartine Blanc, the mayor of Pralognan.Photograph: Kim Willsher/The Guardian“Nobody is particularly worried. The prevention work is being carried out so hopefully the problem will be solved,” said the local cable car operator as the Guardian plunged into the vertiginous void over the village.Arriving in Pralognan – the gateway to the Vanoise national park – on a sunny day, the giant rock faces etched with shimmering cascades that rise almost vertically have a benevolent beauty. An hour later in a rapid change of atmosphere, the peaks are cloaked in dark clouds and loom intimidatingly.“They can appear rather menacing at first to visitors because they are so sheer,” Vion said. The 66-year-old knows these mountains “like his pocket”, as the French say. He made his first high-altitude climb aged eight with his father, also a guide. Both his grandfathers were Alpinists.Vion first spotted what he describes as “a puddle” of water on the Grand Marchet glacier in 2019. Every year since he has watched it grow; it now measures almost 2.5 acres.“The mountain today is very different to 50 years ago. We rarely ever saw lakes like this on the glaciers then or had rockfalls of such intensity and frequency,” he said.He taps his phone to find pictures of the latest chunk of mountain that has collapsed because the permafrost, the cement that holds the rocks together, has melted. “We are on the frontline of climate change here. We know it is happening,” he said.Blanc agreed. “We were born in Pralognan and it’s clear to us there’s no comparison between what we saw when we were kids and today but in recent years things have really speeded up,” she said.“Now we can really see the difference. Even the sun in the mountains is no longer the same. We can feel it. We also have a lot more of the winds that bring sand from the desert, which settles on the glaciers and is also accelerating the melting.”She added: “People here are used to natural hazards. We’re used to avalanches, falling rocks, torrential floods and mudslides because we’ve seen them and lived with them since we were young. Local people understand there are things we can control and then those we cannot.”This article was amended on 11 August 2025. An earlier version referred incorrectly to 13,000 gallons of water when it should have said 60,000 cubic metres. This has been corrected.Explore more on these topicsFranceClimate crisisGlaciersEuropeMountainsWaterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, the president’s hardline stance against wind has slashed the values of its US projects.While the Biden administration was supportive of the burgeoning offshore sector, Trump sent shivers through the industry by ordering a review of offshore wind permitting and leasing on his first day back in the White House in January.The review dealt a blow to an industry still reeling from an increase in costs driven by supply chain problems following the coronavirus pandemic, and fast-rising interest rates that have made building new projects far more expensive.Trump has along-held dislikeof offshore windfarms that dates back at least 14 years to a spat over North Sea wind turbines that were visible from one of his golf courses in Scotland.He has recently claimed that windfarms should not be allowed because they generate “the worst form of energy, the most expensive form of energy” and also “kill the birds”. These claimshave been refutedby experts.Within months of Trump’s return to power, his administration issued a stop-work order to a project spearheaded by the Norwegian wind developer Equinor. The order was a shock to many industry commentators who had believed that projects that had already secured their approvals would be safe from the industry review.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then in September, they would watch helplessly as their farmlands were flooded. Some abandoned their farms, frustrated by fluctuating crop yields.For Ouattara, that was not an option. As her family’s breadwinner, proceeds from the farm catered to the needs of her three children as well as requests from other relatives. Then another farmer mentioned a concept called Smart Valleys that had helped solve similar issues and double his income.“Before, I made 2 tonnes a year [and] earned at least 400,000CFA [west African francs, equivalent to £528.60],” said Ouattara, who has since added maize, tomatoes and cucumbers to her portfolio. “But as soon as we put Smart Valleys into practice, I made 4.5 tonnes, which makes me 900,000CFA (£1,189.34).”Smart Valleys is a low-cost initiative by the nonprofit organisation AfricaRicethat aims to help farmers get better control over the water on their land, for example by using channels, in order to reduce flooding and increase yields. It also helps farmers diversify crop production.The programme – backed primarily by Japan’s agriculture ministry – focuses on inland valleys, low-lying areas between hills with fertile soils that are ideal for agriculture but rarely cultivated due to poor water control. Its head, Elliott Dossou-Yovo, said the valleys cover 190m hectares in sub-Saharan Africa, of which only 10% is cultivated.View image in fullscreenCameroonian scientist Sali Atanja Ndindeng (in glasses) heads a programme that receives and analyses samples at the Africa Rice laboratory to produce healthier varieties for the continent.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The Guardian“In the past, farmers were trying to produce rice only once a year and failing,” said Dossou-Yovo. With his team’s support, fields that used to be abandoned during the dry season are cultivated with alternative crops, thereby diversifying farmers’ portfolios and increasing their incomes.Africa Rice, established in 1971, set a goal to double rice production within a decade in 2009, when it changed its name from West Africa Rice Development Association. Since achieving that target, it has ambitiously turned to self-sufficiency for member states by 2030.The core of its work happens a few miles away from Ouattara’s farm at an 800-hectare research campus, where there are facilities including testing sites, a seed science lab and gene bank with 22,000 rice varieties used by scientists to develop improved strains.View image in fullscreenA sign outside the main Africa Rice campus.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The GuardianFunders include the Gates Foundation, the World Bank, and donor partners including Islamic Development Bank and African Development Bank, though member states also make contributions.The need for Africa Rice arose because in the 1960s and 70s, rice consumption and population growth surpassed food production rate in west Africa, Baboucarr Manneh, its Gambian-born director general, said. Today, rice that was previously reserved for feasting occasions, is arguably the continent’s most popular staple.“Rice is very popular because it is easy to cook,” he said. “It used to seem like a luxury food to many consumers, compared with maize and millet. If you go to Sierra Leone, they used to consume a lot of roots and tubers etc, but people now associate those foods with poverty so they prefer rice.”Sali Atanja Ndindeng heads the rice sector development programme, which develops new varieties in conjunction with market trends and analyses samples received from partner institutions in member countries to help identify good grain quality.“Our goal is to make rice not just an energy-dense food, but a nutrient-dense food … and at the same time, reduce the impact of rice causing peaks in glucose levels when people consume it,” he said. One way to do this, the team thinks, is to promote the consumption of parboiled rice – which some studies have shown has a lower impact on blood sugar levels – in countries such as Ivory Coast, where it is historically unpopular, to mirror countries like Nigeria where it is prevalent.Ndindeng’s teams also make pop rice that can be ground to instant flour for children to eat with milk and chocolate as well as rice crackers integrated with local items including ginger, hibiscus, soy and tamarind which are high in zinc and iron, to tackle deficiencies in those micronutrients.Many barriers are holding back member countries from reaching self-sufficiency. For years, cheap imports have flooded African markets from Asia, where producers benefit from heavy subsidies.Africa imports about 40% of rice it consumes – about 15 to 16 million tonnes every year. More than half of the imports come from India alone.In July 2023, India banned rice exports, citing the need to consume more locally. “That created a panic in Africa,” said Manneh. “African ministers had to go to India to negotiate.”Only a fifth of rice fields in Africa use irrigation, with the rest relying on unpredictable rainfall, so member states are being guided on building climate-resilient systems.View image in fullscreenJars of different rices at the Africa Rice laboratory.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The GuardianTanzania is self-sufficient and exporting within east Africa. In west Africa, Nigeria, is close to doing so.Manneh is hoping for more success stories on a national level, but also on an individual level with farmers such as Ouattara, who are still stunned by what science is doing for their lives.“They welcomed me … They guided me and I thank them,” she said.Explore more on these topicsAfricaFoodRicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has always insisted he is innocent.Shannon was 17 at the time and he and Zaaki were junior members of a local gang known as the DM crew. No DNA linked Shannon to the crime, no motive was ever established and the clothes he was wearing that night had no blood or other forensic evidence found on them.The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) launched a review of the case in January. The decision came afterthe Guardian revealedanalysis of a call between Shannon and another gang member, Rhys Williams.In the recording of the call, made from prison, Williams can be heard telling Shannon he was “the sacrifice” and agreeing that he knew he did not kill Zaaki.Williams was key to securing Shannon’s conviction and he was the only witness who told the court he saw Shannon stab Zaaki.In a new development, Williams’ mother, Petra Williams, told the Guardian that the police put pressure on her son. “They were going to charge him for murder if he didn’t tell them who it was,” she said.In the aftermath of the attack, Williams was the prime suspect. His hand and wrist were injured that night but he left the scene before an ambulance arrived. He was arrested the next day and taken by police to hospital where he claimed he had been injured in a fight outside a club.Williams would not give an account of the night to police but clothes stained with his blood were found in his flat when it was searched. Poor-quality finger marks and DNA were recovered from the handle of a knife with Zaaki’s blood on it found at the scene. While the evidence were too low quality to establish a positive identity, there was sufficient detail to exclude Williams.After two years of concerted pressure from the police to speak to them – and being assured that they would help him find housing if he became a witness – Williams decided to give a statement.He claimed he and Zaaki had been smoking marijuana in a stairwell when Shannon and another man,Abubakar Alawi, who was later convicted of manslaughter, rushed up to Zaaki and started to attack him.Williams said it was Shannon who stabbed Zaaki and that he had been injured when he jumped between them trying to protect his friend.Petra Williams said: “They were going to charge him for murder if he didn’t tell them who it was … They were giving him a hard time.”When asked if her son had been convinced it was Shannon, she said “I think so” and then added: “I don’t really know because Rhys doesn’t really talk much.”Williams, 34, has been working as a hip-hop artist under the alias Bisk and rapping about life in London. He was released from prison last month after pleading guilty to common assault. He was given an 18-week sentence, which he had already served awaiting trial.He did not respond to the Guardian’s questions about his testimony against Shannon.Shannon admits he was among a group of about 20 young men who were in the stairwell that night. But he has said he had gone to collect drugs from around the corner at the time that the stabbing took place.The Guardian has also spoken to a witness who was in the stairwell above where the stabbing took place that night and was interviewed by police but never called to give evidence at the trial.The witness, who did not want to be named, said he had only seen Shannon earlier that evening and that he did not see him among those running away from the scene of the attack when he looked after hearing commotion below.The witness also said he bumped into Williams a couple of years after the trial and that Williams said Shannon “took the rap for everyone”. He said that when he then asked what Williams meant, Williams said “basically everyone put the blame on Kai”.The witness said he could not envisage Shannon killing someone and that he did not think the right man was in prison.According to emails, Shannon’s defence team decided with less than a month to go before the trial not to call seven witnesses who were there that night on the principle of “don’t call them unless we absolutely need them”.Max Harris, who was Shannon’s solicitor at the time and now runs a microbrewery in Wales, said the case was one that had stayed with him as a potential miscarriage of justice. “This one for me has always had a question mark over it,” he said, “It’s always troubled me.”He said he was most concerned by the way police had initially misled Shannon into believing his DNA was on the knife. In fact, all they had was tiny fragments that could not eliminate Shannon but did not identify anyone.Shannon is pinning his hope on the case being sent back to the court of appeal by the CCRC. Shannon applied to it last year with the help of the Manchester Innocence Project and Graham Satchwell, a retired detective.Among the issues the CCRC is considering is a covert recording of a conversation between Shannon and Williams from 2014 about how Shannon came to be convicted. In it, Williams tells Shannon: “You [were] the sacrifice.” When Shannon says he did not kill anyone, Williams answers: “I know, I know.”When Shannon says he should not be in prison, Williams responds: “I know that … I know this.” Williams expresses regret about testifying against Shannon, saying: “It breaks my fucking heart, fam. I had to come Old Bailey and fucking do that.”Williams also appears to suggest on the call that he acted with other gang members to blame Shannon for Zaaki’s killing, saying: “It was a group decision … A group decision was made for this to happen.”When Shannon first applied to the CCRC with the recording, among other evidence, it took the commission more than three years to decide to reject the case. It said the meaning of the recording was not clear enough, that the conversation was elliptical and full of slang and that nowhere in it did Williams make any categorical statement that Shannon did not commit the murder.Afterwards, Shannon’s lawyer asked if the CCRC would at least conduct fresh forensic testing of the knife and other exhibits, given advancements in forensic science. The CCRC refused.Shannon said in a letter to the Guardian: “I feel that in 2015 the CCRC had more than enough evidence that pointed towards my innocence but for whatever reason it was not pursued and I was told I must remain in prison.“I can completely understand that a man died and the public and his family want to see a conviction but it must be the correct person. I was no angel in 2009 but I was and am still no murderer. I have been scapegoated by ex-associates and the authorities.”A CCRC spokesperson said: “Mr Shannon has made two applications to the CCRC. The first application did not result in a referral. We have received a second application in relation to this case. A review into this application is ongoing. It would be inappropriate for us to discuss the case or make any further comment while the application is being reviewed.”A Met police spokesperson said: “We are aware of the case and that it is currently being reviewed by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. We are unable to comment on any specific matters relating to the original investigation while this process is ongoing.”Explore more on these topicsCriminal Cases Review CommissionUK criminal justiceCrimeMetropolitan policeLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Parts of the UK are forecast to be hotter than Bali this week, with thermometer readings likely to hit the mid-30s celsius on Tuesday.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued heat health warnings for all of England. The East Midlands, West Midlands, east of England, London and the south-east have been upgraded to amber from 9am on Tuesday to 6pm on Wednesday.The south-west, Yorkshire and the Humber, the north-west and north-east have yellow warnings in place over the same period.The agency said the heat was likely to have a significant impact on health and social care services, including the potential for a rise in deaths, particularly among over-65s and people with health conditions.Forecasters have said consecutive days of high temperatures could lead to the UK recording its fourth heatwave of the summer. The threshold is met when a location has at least three successive days with maximum temperatures exceeding a designated value, according to the Met Office.This is 25C for most of the UK but rises to 28C in London and the surrounding areas, where temperatures are typically higher.View image in fullscreenPeople walk over a Viking-era packhorse bridge that is normally submerged by Baitings reservoir in Ripponden, West Yorkshire.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThe hottest day of the year so far peaked at 34.7C, which was recorded at St James’s Park in central London on 1 July.Dr Paul Coleman, a public health consultant at the UKHSA, said: “These kind of temperatures can result in serious health outcomes across the population … so it is important that everyone takes sensible precautions while enjoying the sun.“If you have friends, family or neighbours who are vulnerable, it is important to ensure they are aware of the forecasts and are following the necessary advice.

He is close to death, the sheriff said, so could not appear in court or mount a defence.Scotland’s court service agreed instead to hold an examination of the facts hearing, a rare process in criminal cases where the allegations are made without a jury present for the judge to weigh up.The courts used the same process last year to find another former Edinburgh Academy master, John Brownlee,guilty of more than 30 assaults against boys at the schoolwithout a formal trial. The cases have come to light during a public inquiry into systematic abuse in Scottish schools and care homes, leading to a flood of compensation cases.Brownlee’s “sadistic” violence, often against pre-pubescent boys he was supposed to care for in a school boarding house, took place during the same decades as Young’s assaults. Four of the 24 complainants in the Young case, who are all now adult men, were also among Brownlee’s victims.Nicol cleared Young of 28 charges, mainly breaches of the peace and indecent assaults where the former master was accused in court of “perving” on young boys by routinely watching them showering.The sheriff ruled there was strong evidence Young often did so to ensure the boys were showering and changing quickly to ensure they reached their next classes on time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t think that presents Britain in a particularly good light in the 21st century.”Clive is one of the most controversial figures from Britain’s colonial past. The historian William Dalrymple has called himan “unstable sociopath”anda violent asset stripper.The bronze statue, by the sculptor John Tweed was completed in 1912. It shows him in formal dress with one hand resting on the pommel of his sword, the other clutching papers. The inscription on the statue’s pedestaldeclares him simply as Clive.Lady Debonnaire, a former shadow culture secretary, said the statue and the panels around its plinth gave a false impression.“What it doesn’t do is contextualise or indeed give any honesty about what his presence in India actually did. He extracted a vast fortune. His former home, Powis Castle in Wales, contains hundreds if not thousands of objects that he took.“What the statue doesn’t do is give any honesty about the impact of colonial rule on India. There is still a popular view held publicly across the UK of empire as beneficial to its recipients.”Debbonaire described this as “wholly inaccurate”. “Before colonial rule, India was a very developed country. It understood free trade, it was trading with its neighbours – something the East India Company and the other colonising forces successfully crushed.“Since independence, India has grown economically, scientifically, in engineering terms, in computing terms, artistic, and so on and so forth.”Debbonaire was a Bristol MP when Black Lives Matter campaignerstoppled the statue of the slave trader Edward Colstoninto the harbour in 2020.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The court gave authorities eight weeks to create the facilities and install CCTV monitoring to ensure no animals are released back on to the streets.The bench stressed the need for immediate action. “Round up all stray dogs from all localities … whether sterilised or unsterilised,” Justice JB Pardiwala declared. “Children must feel safe while cycling and playing. The elderly must feel safe on their walks.”Stray dog control has become a lightning rod civic issue inDelhiand other Indian cities. While some residents see the dogs as a menace, others consider them to be like family. Many of the dogs are fed daily by “community feeders” who provide food, water and veterinary care.Nishima Bhagat, who attended a candlelight march in the centre of the city on Monday night to protest against the court ruling, said: “We are walking in solidarity to show that there are people for the voiceless. They [the dogs] cannot speak for themselves. They cannot be put into the pounds. We cannot uproot them from the place where they live.”India bears the highest rabies burden globally. Each year about 5,700 people die from rabies, according to government figures, and the World Health Organization believes the toll to be as high as 20,000 deaths.The last dog census, in 2012, put Delhi’s stray population at 60,000 and the figure now is estimated to be closer to 1 million. Dog packs roam parks, construction sites and residential lanes. Attacks on children and elderly people often make news headlines.Between January and June this year, Delhi reported 35,198 animal bite incidents and 49 rabies cases, municipal data shows.Pardiwala dismissed India’s animal birth control (ABC) rules, which mandate that sterilised dogs be returned to their territories, as “absurd” and ineffective. “All these so-called animal lovers, will they bring back the children who have lost their lives?” he said, urging civic authorities to act decisively rather than debate policy.The ruling said there could be no exceptions and that anyone resisting the removals would face charges.Animal protection groups called the order “impractical and inhumane”. Bharati Ramachandran, the chief executive of the Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations, urged large-scale sterilisation, vaccination, and public awareness campaigns.Mini Aravindan, a senior official at Peta India, said: “It’s infeasible to build and staff enough shelters for hundreds of thousands of dogs” and the cost would be huge.Explore more on these topicsDelhiIndiaAnimalsSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The Cook Islands-registered tanker is understood to be part of Russia’s “shadow fleet” – comprising vessels that sail under foreign flags to evade sanctions.The ship was carrying oil from Ust-Luga in Russia across the Gulf of Finland when, prosecutors allege, it dragged its anchoralong the seabedfor about 90km (56 miles) in December 2024.The incident was one of several suspected hybrid attacks on telecommunications services in the Nordic region at the end of last year, putting leaders on high alert and prompting accusations of infrastructure sabotage againstRussia.Finnish authorities seized the Eagle S on 26 December last year when the border guard’s emergency response team and police landed on the ship in the early hours of the morning.‘Shadow fleets’ and subaquatic sabotage: are Europe’s undersea internet cables under attack?Read moreThe seizure was lifted in February and the ship left Finland the following month.Damage to the cables had cost their owners, Cinia and Elisa, “at least €60m in repair costs alone”, the office of the deputy prosecutor general, Jukka Rappe, said in a statement.It added: “The rupture of the extremely high-capacity electricity transmission and telecommunications cables is also suspected of having caused a serious danger to energy supply and telecommunications in Finland, although services have been secured by using alternative connections.”The defendants, it said, had denied any wrongdoing in the preliminary investigation. They believed that Finland “does not have jurisdiction in the matter because the cable damage sites are outside Finnish territorial waters”, the statement said.A lawyer for the United Arab Emirates-based Caravella LLC FZ, the owner of the Eagle S, has said previously that Helsinki lacked jurisdiction to intervene.Rappe disagreed, saying: “The characteristics of the crimes,ie the dangers caused, occurred within the borders of Finland, even though the measures themselves were taken outside Finland.”He told the Guardian that the question of jurisdiction was “one of the critical questions”, but that “the effects of the crime materialised here in Finland. That brings it to the jurisdiction of Finland, I think. But of course it is up to [the] district court to decide whether Finland has jurisdiction or not.”He said he hoped the trial would have an impact on investigations into other alleged cable-cutting incidents in the region over the last two years. Because of its geographical positioning, between Russia and the Baltic, Finland is particularly vulnerable. “Finland is like an island because of the Baltic sea. All of our connections go via undersea cables to Sweden, Estonia and centralEurope,” said Rappe.The indictment has been filed with the Helsinki district court, which will decide on a date for the hearing. The state prosecutor, special prosecutor and regional prosecutor have been assigned to prosecute the charges in court.The three suspects have been under a travel ban in Finland since the start of the investigation.Cinia and Elisa declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsFinlandRussiaEstoniaEuropeTelecomsnewsShareReuse this content"

The NHS in England has been trialling variousjabs in patientsthroughthe Cancer Vaccine Launch Pad (CVLP).Such vaccines train the body’s immune system to recognise cancer cells so any that return after treatments such as surgery can be hunted down and killed, reducing the risk of the disease coming back.Many cancer vaccines, including some of those based on mRNA technology,are personalised to the patient’s tumours.However, a study has suggested a non-personalised, experimental vaccine that is already being made at scale could help prevent the return of pancreatic and colorectal cancer.If borne out by further trials, experts say, the approach could be beneficial since the vaccine is likely to be cheaper and faster to access than mRNA jabs, as well as less toxic than some other therapies.“After a long-term follow-up of this study, we were able to demonstrate that the group of patients who mounted an immune response have a greater likelihood of not having their cancer return and living longer compared to historical expectation of what that patient would do,” said Prof Zev Wainberg, an oncologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a co-author of the study.The authors noted 90% of people with pancreatic cancer and 50% of those with colorectal cancer had mutations in the Kras gene. These mutations result in the production of altered Kras proteins that cause cells to divide and proliferate.Writing in the journal Nature Medicine, Wainberg and colleagues reported how they gave a vaccine called ELI-002 2P to 20 patients who had had surgery for pancreatic cancer and five who had been operated on for colorectal cancer.The vaccine contains peptides – long chains of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. The vaccine works by training the T-cells of the body’s immune system to recognise and kill cancer cells with mutations that result in them producing the altered Kras proteins.At a median follow-up of almost 20 months, the team found patients fell into two groups: 17 who had a strong immune response to the jab and eight who had a weaker response.The team found the former group experienced a longer period before their cancer returned and survived longer overall. Overall, four of those 17 patients died during follow-up, compared with seven of the eight who had a lower immune response.However, the study is early stage research designed primarily to assess safety, involved only 25 participants, had no controls, and looked at two very different types of cancer.Even so, experts said the results were worth noting. Siow Ming Lee, a professor of medical oncology at University College London, who was not involved with the work, suggested the ELI-002 2P vaccine could be combine with other kinds of immunotherapy, and might help a wider range of patients.“With promising early results and potentially fewer side-effects than current oral inhibitors, this off-the-shelf cancer vaccine could expand treatment options for Kras-driven cancers and warrants further testing in larger trials, including exploring its potential use in lung cancers driven by mutations in Kras gene,” he said.Dr Shivan Sivakumar of the University of Birmingham, who works on mRNA-based pancreatic cancer vaccines, said it was fascinating so many of the patients in the study showed a clear immune response to the off-the-shelf vaccine.But Sivakumar noted that a key advantage of personalised mRNA vaccines was that they did not have to rely on mutations in the Kras gene.He said it was now important to carry out randomised control trials of the ELI-002 2P vaccine and follow patients over a longer period.“How many times have we been down this garden path where we’ve got really excited about the science? But actually, ultimately, the real scientific experiment is in patients,” Sivakumar added.Explore more on these topicsCancer researchVaccines and immunisationBowel cancerPancreas cancerMedical researchHealthCancernewsShareReuse this content"

Its new hip practitioners – plus 1980s TV mainstay Roger De Courcey – explain why their vocal tricks and errant dummies are wowing audiences againAnya RyanMon 11 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 19.19 EDTShareIt is the greatest duet, performed solo.Ventriloquismacts became a popular entertainment in the 18th century and have flickered in and out of favour ever since, with a particular heyday on TV in the 1970s and 80s. Now a new generation of performers are reimagining the practice of “throwing your voice” to a puppet or dummy – and they are doing so not just in cabaret and comedy clubs but also on social media feeds.The art form has such a rich history that its modern-day practitioners can be “perceived as just doing an old thing”, says 25-year-old Max Fulham, who is in Edinburgh with his debut fringe show,Full of Ham. Fulham fell in love with ventriloquism when he was nine, absorbing everything he could find about the craft online. “I watched really old-school stuff like Ray Alan, Arthur Worsley and Terri Rogers … I have a massive appreciation for them.”As a ‘vent’, you can say what you want. It’s not you, it’s that little fellow sitting on your kneeDespite learning his trade with conventional puppets, Fulham now uses more unusual tricks in his act. “I think what a lot of ventriloquists are doing now is trying to modernise,” he says. InFull of Ham, this means audiences will be treated to sketch comedy, ventriloquism with objects, and some ventriloquism without anything that resembles a puppet at all. “It is very stripped back. That’s why it feels fresh,” Fulham says.“The stuff without puppets feels like a new path,” he continues. In the show, Fulham uses his voice to become characters that exist only in “the audience’s imagination” while being “an extension” of himself. “It has been a lot of fun to play with … it is the first time I’ve felt I’ve been truly alone on stage.”View image in fullscreen‘You must believe in the bear’ … Roger de Courcey and Nookie in 1976.Photograph: Chris Capstick/Rex FeaturesFulham is not the only ventriloquist trying to push boundaries. The Australian David Salter, who performs the showAn Evening With Dame Granny Smith, uses an apple as his puppet. “The idea is that I’m having an interview with Australia’s most famous apple of screen and stage,” he says. All he has to do to prepare his onstage companion is bite a face into the fruit “and leave it in the fridge for a couple of days”, he says. “It is that simple. But there’s something very whimsical about a puppet that sets out a childlike imagination.”Salter learned this firsthand. He began his career performing with a sock puppet at children’s parties, before branching out into work for older audiences. He cites his early inspirations as Nina Conti and fellow Australian Shari Lewis. While the content of his shows has shifted dramatically, one thing has remained constant. With ventriloquism, the audience are “having a shared hallucination”, he says. “You have to leave your sense of disbelief at the door.”Believing in the puppet is essential for performers, too. Lachlan Werner’s first show, 2023’sVoices of Evil, was created for his witch puppet, Brew, which he had saved up for weeks to buy from a toy shop in Worcester when he was seven. “We’re like old friends,” he says. “I will talk to her off stage, and before a gig I’ll be like, ‘Are you ready?’”For Werner, this relationship makes his performance. “It feels different to being on stage with someone else, but I do feel as if I always have backup,” he says, specifically mentioning the moments his puppet has “saved him” from a flop. “There is a strange thing where, if I think I’m not going to be funny today, I can look at Brew and she seems to say, ‘I’m good, we’ll be OK.’”The relationship between performer and puppet has always been central to ventriloquism’s odd allure. At the peak of his career, the now 80-year-old Roger De Courcey appeared on the 1976 Royal Variety Performance and made regular TV appearances with his sidekick, the growly teddy Nookie Bear. “You always feel there are two of you. You must believe in the bear,” he says. De Courcey came up during ventriloquism’s golden age, when it dominated variety shows, primetime TV and children’s programming. He credits his success to strong comic timing. “I was lucky because I was funny,” he says. “You’ve got to be able to think on your feet, just like a comic.” What drew him to ventriloquism was the licence it offered. “As a ‘vent’, you have a freedom because you can say what you want. It’s not you, it’s that little fellow sitting on your knee.” A puppet can get away with saying what a person can’t.View image in fullscreen‘A visual hook that stops people scrolling’ … ventriloquist Max Fulham with his puppet, Grandad.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThe art form still thrives on provocation. In Werner’s new show,WonderTwunk, he performs alongside a “really horrible puppet” that is nearly lifesize. “He’s like the villain of the piece, just a really icky character – the only puppet I have that I don’t like to be around.” For Werner, as with many ventriloquists, the key lies in building a full, believable persona.But which comes first: the puppet or its personality? For Fulham, the puppet he has used most over the years – Grandad – is rooted in old ventriloquist tropes. “I’m fully aware that a lot of ventriloquists in the past, and still now, will have an old man character,” he says. “It is sort of the archetypal puppet.”One of Werner’s most recent creations came from a “horrid boss character” he used to portray at gigs. “I was playing him with my own body and voice, and then wanted him in the show,” Werner says. Now, a version of him is in WonderTwunk too: a full-sized dad character, designed by puppeteer and prop-maker Freddie Hayes. “He’s a puppet that feels like he’s been grown out of me … he’s like a mix of Donald Trump, Cruella de Vil and Liza Minnelli,” says Werner.View image in fullscreen‘I knew her voice before I got her’ … Steph Ventriloquist with Kaylee.Photograph: Kaleid.meThe performer known asSteph Ventriloquist, meanwhile, specifically ordered and designed one of her puppets, Kaylee, to be a parody of the Kardashians. “I knew exactly what her voice was going to be before I even got her,” she says.No matter how surreal the act, things ultimately always come back to the performer and their hand. Good technique matters – even though De Courcey insists throughout our conversation that he “got away with” not having much of it. Still, most ventriloquists will have spent hours in front of the mirror, learning to keep their lips perfectly still. Steph first picked up a puppet during lockdown, and dedicated months to mastering the subtle arts of mouth control and hand movement. “I had all this time on my hands, so I thought, ‘OK, let’s learn how to do this,’” she says. It took her around nine months to “get good”, she estimates, and she talks me through the fine details that made the difference: keeping the jaw relaxed, placing the tongue precisely, knowing which letters are most challenging. “I spent more hours than I’d like to admit looking at myself. You have to, so you can see which words work.”Such precision is more important than ever in the age of social media, where tight camera angles leave no margin for error. Steph now has more than 22,000 followers on TikTok, where she regularly posts clips with her puppets. “You see quite a few ventriloquists on TikTok,” she says. “And I think those videos are making people stop and go: ‘OK, that’s actually quite cool.’”Fulham believes ventriloquism’s growing visibility online is key to its resurgence. “It has a bit of a visual hook that stops people scrolling,” he says. “It’s probably something most people haven’t seen before.” The short-form content mirrors the quick bursts of performance that audiences would see from ventriloquists on old variety show bills, too. “A ventriloquist would do, like, one minute of something on a TV show – that was all the time they had,” says Werner. “TikTok feels like that very old-school variety thing, where you see a tiny gimmick and then they go off again.”View image in fullscreenA bad apple … David Salter and Dame Granny Smith.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianSalter is confident that anyone who puts their mind to it can become a ventriloquist. When he began, he took out a book from the library and binge-watched YouTube videos. “If you watch the best people do it, you’ll really get a sense for the craft,” he says. “But you have to really love it, because it does take a lot of time and effort.”‘Casually jaw-dropping’: at an Edinburgh fringe of tricks and treats, Ben Hart has the magic touchRead moreFor those who do put in the hours, the reward is a kind of magic: the ability to bring a character to life with only your hands, your voice and a great deal of imagination. “It is a wonderful thing,” says De Courcey. “With Nookie Bear, I could tell anyone to fuck off and it didn’t matter.”Will the art ever regain the heights of De Courcey’s television heyday? Fulham isn’t so sure. “Things have moved to the internet now,” he says. “There isn’t that same culture of late-night TV any more.” Salter thinks it is a possibility: “It is still a niche act. But look what happened with Drag Race … the underground can just pop on to TV and become mainstream.” Whatever happens next, it is clear that a whole new generation of ventriloquists have begun to find their voices.Max Fulham: Full of Hamis at Pleasance Courtyard until 25 August.Lachlan Werner: WonderTwunkis at Pleasance Dome until 24 August.An Evening with Dame Granny Smithis at Underbelly George Square until 25 August.Steph Ventriloquistis on TikTok.Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025PuppetryVentriloquismEdinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)TheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The heavily sanitised trailer, which erased virtually all evidence of a sapphic storyline, meant that DEBSpassed me by for years. Now, I’m making up for lost time.Though DEBS is far from being the first film to explore queerness through the lens of a criminal caper – bank heist thriller Set It Off, gory noir flick Bound and David Lynch’s classic Mulholland Drive all beg to differ – Robinson’s take on a longstanding trope stands out for its distinct lack of grit or peril. It is also an outlier compared with other, more lighthearted lesbian films of the same era. While more traditional romcoms such as Imagine Me and You and Saving Face also attempted to shift the dial, the shame and inner turmoil of their closeted lead characters wrestling with forbidden desires still provided much of the narrative thrust. And while Jamie Babbit’s equally tongue-in-cheek But I’m a Cheerleader has the most obvious similarities, that satire hinged on something much darker and more sinister, parodying the very real harm caused by gay conversion practices.DEBS, on the other hand, remains strangely notable to this day, for simply being a silly, over-the-top, low-stakes noughties thriller that just so happens to have some lesbians in it.Released the year after Charlie’s Angels gaudy, willfully silly sequel Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle, DEBS put an even campier spin on the other high-octane thrillers that dominated in that era. The story centres on a group of teenage spies who have been handpicked for a life of paramilitary espionage on the strength of their high school SAT scores. Much like a pack of Fame Academy hopefuls, the gang live all together in a sorority-styled house and fight against organised crime, all while wearing tiny plaid skirts that help them to resemble extras from Britney Spears’s Baby One More Time music video. Their commander-in-chief, Ms Petrie, turns up frequently as a hologram to deliver classified briefings in the middle of the school canteen. Dominique, played by Devon Aoki, speaks in a farcical French accent, and permanently has a cigarette hanging out of her mouth, and a new man in her bed.Everything is going smoothly enough until a new sighting of DEBS’ terrifying arch-nemesis Lucy Diamond – a murderous supervillain with impeccable eyebrows and a thirst for bloodshed. Details on her origin story are amusingly thin – a bad breakup and an insatiable hatred for Australia are both alluded to – but one thing is even clearer than the girls’ super-reflective lip gloss: she must be stopped. And who better to defeat her than DEBS’ resident goody-two shoes, Amy Bradshaw – who is writing an entire thesis delving into Lucy Diamond’s warped inner psyche.There’s just one problem – Amy isn’t just concealing state secrets. She’s also lying to herself about who she really is, though the tofu scramble she orders for breakfast is a brilliantly on-the-nose hint about where things are headed. Once Amy learns that Lucy is into women after a failed stakeout of her terrible blind date with Russian assassin Ninotchka Kaprova, her fascination with the enemy only builds. Ultimately, our hero and villain end up running away together, faking Amy’s kidnap in order to head off on an extended romantic romp.While her friends obviously feel betrayed at first – her fellow DEB Janet scathingly labels her a “gay slut” after uncovering the scheme – they ultimately conspire against the government to help them flee and find happiness. Amy’s journey of self-discovery may come about through highly unusual means, but her coming-out story is a largely joyful one, and her sexuality is barely a source of plot tension.Though it’s certainly possible to read Amy’s propensity for lying as a deeper metaphor for concealed queerness, doing so would probably mean taking DEBS far too seriously. Here, things are simply not that deep, and 20 years on from its release, there’s still nothing else quite like it.DEBS is available to watch on the Criterion Channel in the US and to rent digitally in the UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsFilmMy feelgood movieAction and adventure filmsComedyComedy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But where it gets really interesting is when they start bonding over their dead dreams …Jack SealeMon 11 Aug 2025 07.59 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 21.31 EDTShareIn a giant TV studio somewhere in Japan, a retired baseball player and a former rugby star are 40 minutes into a competition to see who can do the most sit-ups. Lying with their feet hooked to the top of a steep, bright-pink slide that has long since become a river of sweat, they must respond to a buzzer every five seconds by hauling themselves up using just their abs and hitting a button with their foreheads. They’ve both done that more than 500 times – when someone eventually misses a rep, their feet detach and down they go.If this were Squid Game, the slide would end with a lethal drop. But instead it’s Final Draft, a wholesome and emotional Japanese reality contest for ex-sportspeople, so all that’s at risk is the right to remain in the competition. As a long sequence of incredibly gruelling elimination showdowns whittles 25 contestants down to the one who will win 30m yen (about £150,000), Squid Game is an influence, but so are Gladiators and Ninja Warrior, as well as modern Netflix sports fests like Physical: 100 and Ultimate Beastmaster. Mature British viewers might think of 1970sBBC stalwart Superstars, the multi-event contest between athletes from different disciplines that briefly threatened to turn parallel bar dips into the UK’s national sport.Watching from outside Japan, the barrier to entry is that, unless you’re so keen on water polo, kabaddi, American football or ultimate Frisbee that you watch those sports’ Japanese domestic leagues, you will have heard of very few of the contestants. Perhaps Japanese viewers won’t be that familiar with them either, since the lineup mixes champions with those who never quite made it.View image in fullscreenThe sit-up slides of doom … Final Draft.Photograph: NetflixSo who cares which of these ripped strangers will be the best at running up a mountain or traversing a monkey bar course? The endeavours in Final Draft are long grinds but the contestants are a happy, humble bunch and, watching them in adversity, we get to know and like them. Emerging personalities include gentle-natured bodybuilderKenta Tsukamoto, andHozumi Hasegawa, a wise, wiry boxer with three world-title belts.Olympic wrestler Eri Tosaka’s determination and cunning makes her the most likely of the female contestants to defy the odds in a contest that has a few too many events based on pure physical strength.The star, though, isretired baseball hitter Yoshio Itoi, who looks less like a sportsman and more like the singer in a revered art-pop band– with his high cheekbones, debonair grin and the sort of floppy hair most 43-year-olds don’t have the looks to get away with. Yet he soon proves to be fearsomely strong. Think Bryan Ferry on creatine, or Brett Anderson if he could deadlift a speaker stack.Final Draft needs alluring characters like Itoi-san, because there is a lot of time to fill. The season runs to an endurance-sapping six episodes, or enough time to perform 3,240 sit-ups: the events last for ever, and then in between the epic bouts of grunting and grappling, there’s a lot of chat. The post-exertion interviews tend towards the bland, earnest and obvious: “I was surprised,” people say after something happens that is to some extent unexpected. “I was happy,” they report when an event goes well. The 10-second skip button is your friend as every eliminated contestant gives more or less the same speech about how much they respect their conquerors. To try to keep us entertained, the show employs every reality-contest trick it can think of, from splitting the gang into two groups with either luxury or basic accommodation, to allowing tearful video calls with proud loved ones back home.Eventually, it all leads us to what the show is really about, which is the quiet tragedy of the sportsperson whose career is over. Having had to stop doing the thing they loved due to age, injury or just not being good enough, none of these people have known what to do with their 30s and 40s, and have ended up running fledgling businesses that provide paltry incomes, or working low-level jobs with bosses who are younger than them. Over dinner, or in the panting aftermath of another painful stamina test, they bond over the sadness of dead dreams and regrets that their glory days weren’t greater. That prize money would fund a precious new start.So it does matter whether or not a guy with a sprained ankle can push a giant medicine ball up a slope, and the finale – a three-way tug of war, each labouring to drag themselves to victory, inch by agonising inch – is gripping despite being a much longer scene of grimacing sports personalities trying to pull each other over with ropes than you ever thought you could tolerate. Stick with Final Draft and your hard work is, eventually, rewarded.Final Draft is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

The fans either love it or hate it – and there’s nothing you can do. Working on The Incredible Hulk, for example, took years. So when it’s a new creature, a lot of people get excited.”The guy who portrayed the Bloater got so hot he’d be put in a pop-up tent with air-con on fullThis near-blank canvas led Sims to an unlikely source of inspiration: the snapping mouth of a turtle. “When a turtle opens its jaws,” he says, “it looks like it has rows of teeth – but they’re actually fibres that draw food inward.” He combined this with a Venus flytrap and the result was that uniquely terrifying head that blooms open like a flower, revealing concentric rings of teeth, then clamps down on its prey, usually a screaming child. The Duffer brothers wanted only one modification: no face.View image in fullscreenInspired by a Venus flytrap ... the Demogorgon in Stranger Things.Photograph: NetflixFans of Stranger Things, whichreturns later this year, will find plenty to fear in Alien: Earth, which launches this week. Series creator Noah Hawley has promised a terrifying expansion of the film franchise’s already frightening monsters, introducing new creatures that will rival – and even surpass – the iconic, swoop-skulled, chest-bothering, teeth-within-teeth xenomorphs. “I think we’re giving them a run for their money, certainly,” Hawleyhas said. Alien: Earth, which is a prequel to the first 1979 film, leans heavily into unsettling body horror, too, with new creatures such as the T Ocellus, a jellyfish-like parasite that dislodges the eyes of other organisms in order to seize control of them from within. These newcomers will ensure the series isn’t just recycling established monsters, but introducing fresh causes of terror and revulsion.Like Sims on Stranger Things, prosthetic makeup designer Barrie Gower leaned heavily on nature when he was creating his monstrous designs for The Infected, the term given to humans who get the brain infection in postapocalyptic zombie horrorThe Last of Us. Fungus became an integral part of the creative process, with Gower and his team buying so many bags of “grow your own mushroom kits” for the studio to photograph and 3D print that they soon had 15 species on their hands. “Fungus,” says Gower, “is just such an interesting and beautiful kind of growth. There’s so much to play with.”Gower effectively had a “superpower” for creating monsters out of mushrooms: he hates them, despising everything from their smell to their texture.“It became quite easy to come up with designs that repulsed me,” he says.View image in fullscreenMushroom heavy … one of The Infected in The Last of Us.Photograph: HBOAlong with his mushroom aversion, Gower also has trypophobia, an intense discomfort triggered by the sight of clusters of small holes or bumps. “It gives you goosebumps,” he says. However, rather than avoiding the formations that make his skin crawl, he employed them for maximum grotesqueness in his designs for how The Infected look, finding the perfect guinea pig in his daughter Lottie, who shares his trypophobia. “If she’s like,‘Oh God no dad, I don’t like the look’, I know we’ve succeeded.”The White Walkers, those furrow-faced ice demons in Game of Thrones, required an entirely different approach. Costume designer Michele Clapton envisioned them wearing dark armour that looked salvaged and repurposed, resulting in an austere, unwieldy look. “It was so, so brutal to make,” Clapton says. “The cutting and the bending of the metal was incredibly labour intensive. The armorists just loathed it because they really cut themselves. It’s almost like a huge cheese grater.”The final pieces of armour proved so hazardous that the team actually had to create much safer leather duplicates for fight sequences, meticulously painted to mimic metal. Protecting all the prosthetics also proved difficult, given the sharp edges. Another major challenge, ironically, was keeping the White Walkers warm while filming in near freezing temperatures. “We had hot-water bottles we could place inside the costumes,” says Clapton. “But as there were so many prosthetics, you had to be really careful, because they could easily tear.”View image in fullscreenLike a huge cheesegrater … a White Walker in Games of Thrones.Photograph: Helen Sloan/HBOIn fact, keeping performers comfortable in elaborate costumes and prosthetics is a major headache for monster creators. Gower encountered this with the Bloater – the hulking, spore-spewing, elaborately ridged behemoth inThe Last of Us. “We built this big suit that, in terms of size, was like wearing a sofa,” he says. “It was made out of a very soft foam latex material. It’s like a huge sponge, but split into six sections and zipped on to the performer.” There was one very predictable consequence: “You just got really hot.”The inside of the costume could become so sweltering that, between shots, the team had to unzip the back and fan down Adam Basil, who portrayed the Bloater, sometimes even putting him in a pop-up tent complete with an air-conditioning unit on full blast to cool him down. According to Gower, the huge weight, restricted movement and the need for agility combined to make the Bloater costume ultimately unworkable. The team ended up enlisting the help of Wētā FX in New Zealand, who took detailed scans of all the Bloater’s textures and created a digital version.Such mega-budget productions give creators the luxury of experimentation, with digital backup plans should their monster imaginings go awry. But on shows such asDoctor Who, it’s a different story – as special effects artist Neill Gorton discovered. On the BBC’s cult show, he encountered something every bit as scary as the Time Lord’s weekly foes: a very limited budget.View image in fullscreenSend for the air-con tent! … the Bloater in The Last of Us.Photograph: HBO“It was a comedown in one way,” he says, “coming from working in Hollywood. I had a production design friend who introduced me to Doctor Who. When I asked what it was like, he said, ‘It’s fun – but they just don’t have money.’ I thought, ‘Well, what the hell, I just want to work on it.’ And sometimes it can actually be more fun, because you’ve got to be more creative.”Take the Weeping Angels, those statue-like alien humanoids that are able to send their victims back in time with a simple touch, gorging on the “time energy” this releases. Producers had initially envisioned using numerous statues, believing that costumed performers painted as statues would resemble street performers too closely. But there was a problem. “The sheer number of statues required would have been impossible given the timeframe,” says Gorton. “You would need a different statue for every pose. That would have been a minimum of 30 statues.”Forced to find an alternative, he suggested a design that was part prosthetic, part costume, part body paint. “The producers thought it was ridiculous. But we literally had no choice!” he says. Gorton would paint the actors, attach fabric, then “glue it all together and hope for the best”. At that point, he realised how little time he and the team had left to bring the idea to life – just two weeks, compared to the five they would normally have to prepare for an episode. Sadly, this realisation came too late: Gorton had already talked everyone into his idea.View image in fullscreen‘Total scramble’ … a Weeping Angel in Doctor Who.Photograph: James Pardon/BBC StudiosThe result? “A total scramble!” They discovered that the masks used to create the Weeping Angels’ haunting blank stare left the performers unable to see. Fortunately, this wasn’t a huge issue, since the creatures had to remain perfectly still – a feat the team achieved by having the actors sit on a bicycle seat attached to a hidden pole. “On a bigger budget,” says Gorton, “you would never go down that road. But given no choice, we just had to be smart and quick about it.”Of course, it isn’t just the pressure of budgets and time that lead to human-being-based effects. The Duffer brothers were adamant from the start: the Demogorgon would be portrayed by a performer in a suit. This presented probably the biggest conundrum when it came to designing the creature. “Its legs are unusually long,” says Sims. “It has kind of an extra joint. That makes it very challenging for an actor – to be put into stilts and have to run around and jump. The question was, ‘How do I keep the design the Duffer brothers love – but make it work for a person in a suit?’”Whatever the challenges and the solutions, Sims finds there is always one benefit of working with flesh-and-blood performers: they ground any design in reality. “It’s important to find things in nature the human eye can identify with,” he says. “If you take a human thing that’s scary, then you add all those things to it, that makes it even more scary.”Asked how he makes monsters such as The Infected so deeply disturbing, Gower makes a similar point: taking everyday things like mushrooms and making them seriously creepy is a guaranteed win. “Using realistic source material is the key,” he says. “Keeping things familiar is always going to make them more terrifying. It just gives you goosebumps.”Alien: Earth is on Disney+ from 13 AugustExplore more on these topicsTelevisionStranger ThingsDoctor WhoThe Last of UsFantasy TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not long out of high school, the best friend with whom she planned to start a business died in a car accident. Then her elder sister, Megan Henneberg, was murdered in 2007 by her husband Brian, leaving Chelli, her parents, siblings and extended family to deal with the harrowing loss.And yet, no matter how much sympathy you might feel for Chelli and her family’s trauma, or interest you might have in her bagmaking skills, or engagement with her as a person, somehow those core components don’t coalesce to make this feature-length documentary feel vital or even especially necessary. A self-described introvert, Chelli herself is a pretty opaque figure although she speaks quite expressively and intelligently about her approach to design. We only get tiny glimpses of her home life with husband David, so she’s not really developed as a “character” sufficiently to carry the film.Meanwhile, the story around her sister’s murder has something of a shroud around it, which is understandable to an extent, but then turns the film into a strange fan dance, alternating revelation with concealment about the facts of the case. In the end, the fact that Chelli found a way to forgive her brother-in-law in a religious sense, seems to be the big takeaway, but the wafty haziness around the whole issue reduces the murder to a brutal but incidental noise off-screen.The most engaging parts of the film are the scenes where Chelli is at work at her fancy industrial Juki sewing machine in her alarmingly tidy, sepulchre-white studio. The hum of the machinery is as seductively lulling as an ASMR video and watching Chelli buy leather hides is pure shopping pornography. Even more visually lush is the sequence where Chelli goes off to Florence to take a course in leatherwork and design to refine her skills, offering the film-makers a chance to shoot one of the world’s more photogenic cities at crepuscular times of the day. All of which makes the surprise ending even more baffling, denying viewers the redemption–through–small-business-ownership ending the film appears to be striving for.Dawn Dusk is on digital platforms from 15 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsHandbagsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Bookended by vivid depictions of the sea, it also brought the chance to hear a piece inspired by a very different body of water: The Rose Lake,Michael Tippett’s swansong, completed by the 88-year-old composer in 1993.The Rose Lake was written after Tippett visitedLake Retbain Senegal, where a particular kind of algae turns the water pink. Spare, translucent music links thickly textured episodes that evoke the idea of the lake itself singing through the day – a slow, expansive melody that changes yet remains essentially the same. It’s not often performed – partly because of the demands on the percussionists and the sheer amount of hardware it requires to create Tippett’s otherworldly soundscape. Ranged along the back of the Albert Hall stage, next to every other percussion instrument you can think of, was a long line of three dozenrototoms: tuned drums a bit like miniature timpani. Two of the LPO’s percussionists darted back and forth along this line, arms whirling and sticks flying, looking from a distance like panicked spiders but hitting their marks to weave gossamer melodic effects. Even if the piece itself has the occasional longueur, it sounded glorious here as conducted by Edward Gardner.Ravel’s song cycle Shéhérazade, conjuring up an imagined, exotic Asia, marked the Proms debut of the recently anointed star mezzo-sopranoAigul Akhmetshina. Her singing shone, riding above the orchestra with seeming ease; and yet for all this power she seemed more the wide-eyed innocent than the indulgent dreamer. Perhaps in this huge hall a more operatic approach would have captured more of the songs’ sensuousness. The orchestra, however, had this covered, here and throughout, Gardner blending sonorities seamlessly with forensic attention to detail. Sibelius’s 1914 tone poem The Oceanides evoked both far horizons and a sense of fairytale; the first movement of Debussy’s La Mer went from uneasy, tense dawn music to a midday blaze. The best music about the sea is not just waves and water but time, space and, above all, light.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

Afghanistan is an incredible place, an incredible society. It’s always like time travel to me, and I knew people there that are larger than life. They stay with you … I may return shortly.”Jobless, homeless and helpless without a man: Afghan women expelled by Iran into hands of the TalibanRead moreNow 68, Anderson reported from Afghanistan in the 1980s, as Soviet forces lost a 10-year war, and returned in the 2000s, after 9/11 prompted the US to invade. In 2002, Anderson publishedThe Lion’s Grave, a well-received book on al-Qaida’s assassination of the mujahideen leader Ahmad Shah Massoud two days before the attacks on New York and Washington, and how the US ousted the Taliban.In the foreword to his new book, Anderson writes of that time: “The mission of the US and its coalition allies appeared to have been a qualified success. TheTalibanhad vanished into the hills, as had al-Qaida, and a pliant new pro-western regime had been installed.”The new book contains reporting on the 20-year US occupation, its chaotic end, and the Taliban’s return. So its title is telling:To Lose a War.One standout chapter comes from 2010. US control had deteriorated. Given no choice, Anderson embedded with a cavalry squadron in Maiwand, in the south. The resulting report, The Day of the Superwadi, is bookended by the deaths of young Americans in IED explosions – an unsparing portrait of military might mired in lethal futility. At the time, Anderson refused to let it be published.He was “severely disappointed to see that what had happened in Iraq, which I had witnessed firsthand [the subject of his 2004 book,The Fall of Baghdad] had happened in Afghanistan: the suicide blast walls were up, Kabul itself was behind this strange geometry of walls, westerners were cut off from the Afghans”.Anderson “really disliked” embedding. He felt “incredibly alienated, displaced. It was exactly in the same area I’d reported from back in the late 80s, and yet I was even displaced from that. I left Afghanistan feeling really nonplussed and telling my editor I didn’t think I had a story. And he said: ‘No, come on. You can write it.’ And I did, and I still had this just,deadfeeling. I don’t know if it’s the only story in the New Yorker’s history, or one of very few, where an author has asked the editors to kill it, but I did and they honored that. And I said: ‘I feel I have to go back, because this story doesn’t feel right.’ And I did go back.”View image in fullscreenTo Lose a A War by Jon Lee Anderson.Photograph: Penguin Random HouseIn 2011, Anderson embedded again but with Afghan soldiers, too, on the Pakistan border. The result was another powerful essay,Force and Futility.“I was able to define better what I was seeing,” Anderson said. “Clearly, I was always a foreigner, an outsider, but I had that experience of being with Afghans.”More than a decade later, putting together To Lose a War, Anderson finally saw the value of the piece he had killed. He “realized it had an integrity. It helps fill in the blanks. Ultimately, if I have a critical observation, it’s that the United States … I mean all of the west, but really it was always US-led … they never really engaged with Afghanistan. That was what I was feeling. I knew it to be just a terrible thing. [The US effort] was doomed because of that.”Anderson provides compelling portraits of American soldiers in extremis. Prey to the shifting realities of Afghanistan, Lt Cols Bryan Denny and Stephen Lusky are driven, idealistic and lost.“They were honorable men,” Anderson said. “At the point I was seeing them in the war, the chance to win had passed. They never came out and said, ‘This is doomed.’ They couldn’t: they had young, young boys they were trying to keep alive, and they were doing the best they could. But I had this really strong sense that they knew.“This was their job. It was an honorable thing. And what was interesting, and I guess among some soldiers you do find this, was this sense of idealism. We tend to objectify them: guns and uniforms and so on. But actually the US military includes a hell of a lot of idealists, many more than you tend to meet in your life. They try to believe in what they’re doing, because they’re dealing with life and death every day. So I try to acknowledge that but also get to the human story.”Maiwand, where Lt Col Denny served, was home to a physical reminder of Afghanistan’s bloody history. About 10 miles (17km) from the US base stood “a very large, oddly shaped dirt mound … ris[ing] inexplicably up from the flatland”. In 2011, it housed the Afghan national police. It was built thousands of years before, by Alexander the Great.The Americans stayed for 20. Combat operationsendedin 2014, under Barack Obama, but the last troops left in 2021, Joe Biden overseeing a withdrawal initiated by Donald Trump. The result was bloody chaos: 13 Americans and at least 170 Afghanskilledby a suicide bomber, the Taliban surging back to power, civilians scrambling to get out.Anderson helped Afghans escape. He also went back toreport, “with the central question that we all had, which was: ‘Is this the old Taliban or the new Taliban?’ We didn’t really know.“In the first missives out of there, we saw our colleagues interviewing guys dressed in the usual Kandaharshalwar kameez[traditional tunic and trousers], and also another group of Taliban dressed up in American special forces uniforms,” he continued. “And we saw that they no longer were prohibited to deal with the graven image, because they had smartphones. So there was this kind of hope that they were different.“And so most of my foray involved trying to get in front of Taliban officials, whoever I could, and guys in the field, and ascertain where their heads were at and whether they were, in fact, the new warm and fuzzy or the old astringent and cruel Taliban.“I came away, especially from the leadership, with apprehension. I didn’t feel that they dealt with me honestly … whether it was the guy in Bamiyan or the foreign minister designate or the information minister in Kabul. And so that remains unresolved.”Afghanistan has never gone to a new stage without spilling bloodJon Lee AndersonAnderson seems more certain about the fate of Afghan women.“Pretty much every woman I met who was able to talk with me on their own asked me for help to get out of the country,” Anderson said. “Not just women. Pretty much everyone I met who was not with the Taliban asked me, whether it was a civil servant, an assistant in the ministries, stewardesses on an airplane.“I met this group of women I talked to at length, and I followed up with some of them, and they knew what was coming. I don’t say it in the book, but I remained in touch with one. She managed to get her family out. First in Mexico, now in the States. I don’t know if they’re deportable [by Trump] or not.“One woman said: ‘I know what’s coming. I know what they’re going to do.’ And she was right. It’s even worse than what one would have expected four years ago. Women have been formally prevented from speaking outside their homes, which are like fortresses. They can’t travel without a male companion from their family. I don’t even know what they’re doing about maternity wards in hospitals now.”Anderson sees few signs for optimism.View image in fullscreenA military transport plane launches off while Afghans who cannot get into the airport to evacuate, watch and wonder while stranded outside, in Kabul, Afghanistan, 2021.Photograph: Marcus Yam/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images“There are factions within the Taliban,” he said of the perennial struggle for power. “It’s not over. Will this come to blows? It could.”Among warring parties is anIslamic Stateoffshoot Anderson called “Frankenstein’s Isis,Isis Khorasan, which is just a more extreme version of the Taliban.“Afghanistan has never gone to a new stage without spilling blood,” he continued. “There’s a few countries like that. This conceit we have in the west, that you can only get to the next threshold of history through peace negotiations or some kind of civic compact … it doesn’t happen in the old world. It doesn’t happen in this place. The new stages are always reached through bloodshed.“And I don’t know how you break that dynamic, but this group in power now has not broken it, nor will they break it. They’re seeking it with new injustices that will need to be redeemed or avenged. And that’s just the way it is.“And once again, the west turns away, because Afghanistan is a place of shame and failure. But it’s still there. Just like it was for the Soviets, just like it was for us, and so on back through time.”To Lose a War isout on Penguin Press on 12 AugustExplore more on these topicsBooksAfghanistanTalibanHistory booksSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

His life’s work is like a dark, glittering, ethereal yet earthy river of thought, full of angels, ghosts, nocturnes, animals. These are books as brimming with spirit and light as they are with eroticism and violence. If there is one word I would use to summarise Burnside’s work, it’s grace. He was a graceful writer, in terms of his elegance, but also one concerned with redemption and the moments of light that emerge from sorrow and great pain.Burnsidedied in 2024 at the age of 69, not long after being awarded the David Cohen prize for literature, an award that recognises a lifetime’s achievement. Before that, he had won just about every award going in the poetry world: the Forward prize, the TS Eliot prize and the Whitbread book award among them.Though Burnside was best known as a poet, he wrote novels, memoir and literary history, too. If the dark places of the human experience attract you, you’re in luck; but if not, don’t be put off. Burnside is also a writer of warmth, humour and deep humanity.The entry pointWaking Up in Toytown is the second in Burnside’s trio of memoirs. Disquieting, lyrical and precise, it covers alcoholism, madness, self-destruction, the search for normality and being “a full-scale lunatic”. Burnside also writes about the seductiveness of darkness and oblivion, the vertigo of falling in love, the strange sensation of hearing voices, of seeing things. But all the while this is a deep, philosophical book about lives falling apart and being re-made. It is rich in language, hypnotic in its logic, utterly captivating in its vision of brokenness and redemption.The page-turnerBurnside wrote 11 novels. If you were to pick up one, I’d recommend Glister. It’s like a series of True Detective set in a post-industrial Scottish village, where a disused chemical factory has poisoned the landscape. As boys go missing in the poisoned woods year after year, the novel charts a disturbing path rich with mystery, unafraid of exploring the violence we commit against each other and against the planet. Chilling and completely compelling.‘His greatness was matched by his kindness’: remembering John BurnsideRead moreThe masterpieceIf you want to head straight for the masterpiece, and the one that captures the essence of Burnside’s exquisite achievement in poetry, his 2011 collection Black Cat Bone is the one to read. It was awarded the TS Eliot prize and the Forward prize, making Burnside one of just four poets to have won both of the UK’s most prestigious poetry awards for one book. Black Cat Bone has a mythic, ritualised quality, with a strange ethereality that pushes us, poem by poem, from the brink of the known into a world immanent with spirits and haunting intimations. It repays many, many readings.The one you’ll learn fromIn The Music of Time:Poetryin the Twentieth Century, Burnside moves through his personal life and those of writers responding to war, political turmoil and environmental damage. This is a book where Burnside shows us how to read, how to live a life formed by reading, how poetry knits its way into our minds. It is also a curiously uplifting, rousing book. “Hope”, he writes, “is of the essence for all poets. We might even say that to make a poem at all is an act of hope.”The one to drop into dinner party conversationI Put a Spell on You is Burnside’s final memoir, though it pushes the bounds of that form. Taking a song as the title for each chapter, it is a book about love, glamour, enchantment and the erotic thrill of the wild. It captures his tenderness and humanity, exploring masculinity and art, the blues, Nina Simone, the Temptations and murder ballads, all the while telling with breathtaking magic how it feels to fall, sumptuously and decadently, in love.An older classicWinner of the Whitbread prize for poetry, Burnside’s 2000 collection The Asylum Dance is a lucid, hymn-like series of poems that moves between ideas of home and the urge to leave. There are the lights of fairgrounds, villages, ships at sea. Structured around four longer poems, The Asylum Dance has all of Burnside’s trademark visionary music. These poems might require some work, but they wash over you like a fresh salt tide, buoyant, bearing the reader to unexpected, mysterious places of trial and epiphany.John Burnside: ‘My stoner friends were into The Hobbit, but Gormenghast was darker’Read moreThe last bookAn elegiac evensong of a book,The Empire of Forgettingis Burnside’s last collection, and is a resonant demonstration of his lasting power. These are poems of autumn, of the misty woods, of “ghost lights”, wings, the haunting sounds of distant birds. Voices call through the evening dusk, beckoning us home, and though mortality is always present, there is too a sense of rest and the beauty of night-music. Burnside leaves us at dusk: “Fog on the roads, the harvest gathered in / by lantern-light; our work, if it is work, / accomplished.”The Empire of Forgettingis now published in paperback by Jonathan Cape alongside reissues of Burnside’s memoirs:A Lie About My Father, introduced by Megan Nolan;Waking Up in Toytown, introduced by Sarah Perry; andI Put a Spell on You, introduced by Seán Hewitt.

As a player who previously worked as a bookseller, and currently is a novelist, I am poised to be extremely stressed out by a game set in a mobile bookshop. However, Tiny Bookshop is crafted with such care and balance that I found myself losing hours to the gentle pace and tiny puzzles and sheer escapism of the world it presents.The setup is simple, and one that is common to many games in the post Stardew Valley era of“cosy” games. You throw in your old life and open a shop selling tiny things you are passionate about to a bustling little community full of interesting characters who you progressively develop relationships with by providing them with goods and services. Days, weeks and seasons pass, the world grows richer and more interesting around you, the stakes rise and fall, a tiny economy evolves from your business.View image in fullscreenA lush, lived-in community … Tiny Bookshop.Photograph: Neoludic GamesHowever, what is different this time is that you are not selling farmed goods as in Stardew Valley, or tea as in Spirittea orWanderstop, or, in the case of Spiritfarer, shepherding dying souls to the other side via your floating bed and breakfast. You’re selling books. Actual books. From Wilde and Shakespeare and Woolf and Agatha Christie all the way through to Toni Morrison and John Green and Holly Black, you are providing the inhabitants of a sleepy seaside and university town with books that are recognisable and real. Every book that you stock in your little trailer shop is, to my knowledge, a real one.Now, this will place some players at an advantage – if you’re a reader, selling books to people will come easily. You won’t need to study the flavour text to compare books the customers like with books you have in stock: if they’re looking for something scary, romantic, and historical, Carmilla ticks all the boxes. You’ll know what graphic novels feel a little heady, or which ones are for a more casual reader.This feels to me like a rare game made with readers in mind: the puzzle of finding which books suit which customer’s request comes quite quickly, even if the in-game algorithm sometimes didn’t match my personal taste. I think The Great Gatsby would appeal to a customer looking for philosophical fiction, but the game doesn’t. Like working in an actual bookshop, there are genres and categories that serve a watertight function; unlike working in a bookshop, personal taste doesn’t come into it. However, Tiny Bookshop is adept at teaching you its rules, and recommending the wrong title doesn’t come at a high cost. The stakes aren’t too steep. There is no real way to lose.Cosy video games are on an unstoppable rise. Will they unleash a darker side?Read moreI played using the touchscreen on my Steam Deck, which I found deeply pleasing and responsive compared to using the buttons, which were a little tricky. Decorating my tiny bookshop was great: discovering I could acquire a shop dog was a real joy. The local characters are quite a serious bunch and hold some old dramas and pathos – there is a sense of a lush, lived-in community unravelling secrets and context as the seasons pass by. It is the first new game I’ve found myself truly relaxing into in quite some time: the gameplay is rhythmic and mellow, and, dare I say it, genuinely cosy. Tiny Bookshop provides players with a job that doesn’t feel like a job but a lovely escape into words and stories.Tiny Bookshop is out nowExplore more on these topicsGamesIndie gamesRole playing gamesSimulation gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Entering the apartment, out of the Mediterranean sun, visitors would need a minute to adjust to the dimness, gradually perceiving faded curtains and heavy furniture, every surface covered with antiques and whimsical objects. There was no electricity, only candlelight. The host, proffering morsels of bread and cheese from the shadows, was an older man with “enigmatic eyes” beneath round spectacles – the poet Constantine Cavafy.What kind of person might be discerned amid the gloom? This is what Peter Jeffreys and Gregory Jusdanis set out to discover in their deeply researched and engaging biography, the first for 50 years. They brilliantly recreate his world – two chapters about Alexandria are especially good – and investigate his place within it. Cavafy, whose admirers and champions included WH Auden, EM Forster, David Hockney and Jackie Onassis, has remained enigmatic since his death at 70 in 1933. Surprisingly, for a poet who never sold a book in his lifetime – and instead circulated broadsheets, pamphlets and sewn notebooks, building his reputation poem by poem – he now has “a global audience he could never have imagined”, thanks to poems such as The City, Waiting for the Barbarians and Ithaca, which Onassis asked to be read at her funeral.Born in Alexandria in 1863, Constantine lost his father aged seven. His mother, Haricleia, moved the family to England, with periods in Liverpool and London. A short-lived return to Alexandria, curtailed by the British bombardment of the city in 1882, was followed by three years in Istanbul, Constantine’s “urban finishing school”, where he may have had his first sexual encounters. He returned to Alexandria for good in 1885 and published his first poem the following year. To support himself, he worked for three decades as a clerk at the office of irrigation services, a dull job for a bright mind, but one which left plenty of time and energy for his livelier imaginative life.There is no poet quite like Cavafy. His tone is terse, often ironical; his style plain, prosaic, without metaphor, simile, rhyme or rich vocabulary. He is not for everyone. Thom Gunn, writing to a friend, wondered why Cavafy had never interested him. “Is it because the translations haven’t been very good or because I feel pressures on me to like his work simply because he is homosexual?” Cavafy’s best poems have a toughness and detachment that Gunn would have liked; his worst are mired in the same sentimentality that Gunn worried he was perpetuating in his own work.Had he not become a poet, Cavafy once remarked, he would have been a historian instead. His lifelong interest in Byzantine and Hellenic history informed much of his output. He is, as Charles Simic said, “a poet of a lost world”. A poet of lost history, too. Small episodes, forgotten figures and peripheries were his subjects. Caesarion, for example, written on the eve of the first world war, shocked Cavafy’s contemporaries not only because it supposedly demonstrated his ignorance of contemporary events, but also “focus[ed] on an erotic attraction and poetic creation, linking homoeroticism and artistic inspiration”. Bored of Athens and Sparta, Cavafy reached into the lesser known, unheroic past, in search of models.There is a certain unreality to the Cavafian canon, a dreamlike or illusory quality that one cannot help but compare to Cavafy the man, standing, as Forster put it, “at a slight angle to the universe”. The young men in his poems, note his biographers, often “cross the barrier between reality and imagination”.Alexandria, too, shimmers there and threatens to dissolve. Some of his contemporaries criticised Cavafy for eschewing realist descriptions, but he understood, as Jeffreys and Jusdanis write, that “his work’s emotional energy lay in evocations, dreams, allusions and feelings”. Moments from urban life – an attractive shop assistant, the “momentary brush” against him – lend sensual and erotic energy to his compositions. But cosmopolitan Alexandria was also a town of curtain-twitchers and keyhole-snoopers, and Cavafy – fearing social rejection and exile from the city he loved – became more discreet and conventional. “Acknowledging homosexuality in his poetry and censoring himself in life,” the authors suggest, “actually inspired and ‘sustained’ his poetry.”The challenges for biographers are manifold: a lack of surviving letters, an “unremarkable” daily routine, an almost complete absence of information about his romantic life (for this, the poems are our main sources). Jeffreys and Jusdanis suggest that the archive may have been tampered with to remove compromising material, both by Cavafy himself and by his executors, Alekos and Rika Sengopoulos.For a poet whose “captivating” voice and “scintillating” conversation have been widely praised, his surviving letters are mostly terse and bureaucratic. Thanking Forster, a good friend and tireless supporter, for sending A Passage to India, Cavafy wrote merely: “It is an admirable work. It is delightful reading. I like the style. I like the characters. I like the presentation of the environment.”Such obstacles necessitate an unconventional structure, and Jeffreys and Jusdanis eschew the standard birth-to-death narrative. (To compensate for the “hollowness” of the archive and the “deep absence of information”,Jusdanis wrote in 2018, “a biographer of Cavafy has to work like a novelist, conjecturing and recreating scenes, filling in the gaps”.) We begin and end with Cavafy’s death and are given, in between, “a circular narrative through various thematic sequences”– discrete chapters, that is, about Cavafy’s family, friends, city, poetry and his obsessive attempts to launch and secure his literary reputation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Eventually, “the self-interested, self-involved poet of middle age” seems to win out over “the warm, loving, affectionate young man”. Yet he remains sphinx-like, just out of reach, and we are left sympathising with the many guests he received in his dusky, eccentric apartment, like the Greek poet Myrtiotissa, who “felt the whole visit had an air of unreality” and, descending the stairs back into sultry, clamorous Alexandria, began to doubt whether she had seen and spoken to him at all.Michael Nott is the author ofThom Gunn: A Cool Queer Life(Faber).

James Clements, playing the part of Robert Burns, says something about the weather, and suddenly a streak of lightning cuts down the length of the table top. It has a gash down the middle for that very purpose.It is a sign of the attention to detail in Cora Bissett’s excellent production. What could have been a by-the-numbers tribute to Scotland’s national poet is altogether more subtle, imaginative and contentious. The long, undulating table, designed by Jenny Booth and cleverly lit by Elle Taylor, continues to play an unexpected part: Clements appears from beneath a domed plate cover in a scene of hungover contrition, while a cutlery boat sets sail under its own steam towards the West Indies.Oh yes, the West Indies. One of the inconvenient truths about this people’s poet, the man who wrote the egalitarianA Man’s a Man for a’ That, is that it was only his newfound career as a published writer that stopped him heading to Jamaica to work in the slave trade.Clements’s script, drawing on private letters and recently digitised historical archival material, plus the voices of modern commentators, does not gloss over this, nor the poet’s womanising. Rather, it presents a rounded picture of a contradictory man who could write tender verse one minute and abandon a pregnant woman the next.Burns is embodied with gusto and rounded Ayrshire vowels by Clements, accompanied by Lisa Rigby, singing sweet renditions of favourites such as Ae Fond Kiss on guitar and shruti box. It works as both a primer to the short life of this farmer turned celebrity and a knotty study of his politics, compromises, artistic enthusiasms and colourful love life.At theGeorgian House, Edinburgh, until 16 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalRobert BurnsPoetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Baring their souls through song, Ohio is introduced as a “death concert” in response to the indie-folk musicians’ young son asking what happens when we die. But this bittersweet story of family, faith and loss is almost ferociously about grabbing hold of life.The Bengsons create harmonies that glide directly to the top of your spine. Both clearly feel the music in their bones, but it’s Abigail who shows it, her body unable to resist moving to the tumbling scales they create together, her bright, beaming face turned up to the sky. Director Caitlin Sullivan helps the pair gracefully shape their story on stage, treading softly between gig, presentation and choir rehearsal.The potted narrative sticks closer to Shaun, who is the drily comic balance to Abigail’s bounding enthusiasm. Guiding us through his repressive Lutheran upbringing, he eases out of the religion’s grasp but holds on to what faith means for his father, and what his father means to him. Narrowing our focus, the show homes in on Shaun’s degenerative hearing loss. In one revelatory scene, their microphones are modulated for us to understand what Shaun hears now, certain tones and consonants absent to him, then thickening and distorting as that blank mugginess will intensify over time. With creative captions that tremble as the sensory experience distorts, this slow theft is devastatingly wrought.Dance People review – join Edinburgh festival’s promenade of protest and playRead moreThe pair create the atmosphere of holding our hands throughout, with angelic, ululating folk song accompanying the thoughtful ways they see and explain life. Their story serves as both a formal introduction to them as a couple as well as a deeply spiritual meditation on the world we live in. A revenant hush accompanies everything they say. A song to Shaun’s choirmistress who helped a shy, almost unspoken child unfurl is shattering.

From there, it is a Wizard of Oz head trip as her character takes flight, chased down oppressive passageways like the darker corners of her own subconscious.

It seems a plausible explanation. Why else would someone do something so eccentric? Dressing up in period costume and driving to the fields to relive ancient battles is one of those pastimes, like train spotting, metal detecting and attending fan conventions, we like to imagine as an oddball pursuit.But there is more going on here than a straight celebration of everyday British quirkiness. True, Melody hasform in this area: she became a beauty queen to see what it was like for her pet to be entered in a dog show and spent a year living with pigeon fanciers. That is as well as the time she trained as a funeral director when she thought her dad was dying.As a self-styled anthropologist with a “passion for other people’s passions”, she has a genuine love of peculiar hobbies. Her eyes light up when she describes the lengths her new friends go to in the name of historical accuracy. But in Trouble, Struggle, Bubble and Squeak, she demonstrates an interest that goes beyond the whimsical.For this is a story, directed by Mark Thomas, less about history buffs dressing up in old costumes and eating authentic stew, and more about people resisting authority and taking control of their environment. Having muddled up the musketeers of the English civil war with her memory of watchingDogtanian, she is fascinated to find a conflict between not only royalists and parliamentarians, but also radical groupings such as the Levellers, Ranters and, in particular,the Diggers.‘TikTok is like an old-school variety show’: what’s behind the surprising boom in ventriloquism?Read moreThe belief of this dissident group in equality and access to common land strikes a chord with Melody as she works as an artist-in-residence on the deprived Whitehawk estate in Brighton.

This, likewise, was an utterly involving evening that captured the urgency of La Clemenza di Tito’s speedy composition.US mezzo Angela Brower brought palpable anguish to the trouser role of Sesto, torn between loyalty to the too-good-to-be-true emperor (tenor Giovanni Sala) and love for the more imperious Vitellia (Tara Erraught). Tito’s search for a faithful consort who meets with the approval of Rome’s citizens, as reported to him by bass Peter Kálmán’s Publio or sung by the excellent SCO Chorus, is further complicated by Servilia (Hera Hyesang Park) already being in love with Annio (Maria Warenberg).If act one makes dating apps look sluggish, this luxury cast and Emelyanychev’s energising direction of the SCO strings matched the pace with superb performances. Following The Magic Flute and Così Fan Tutte, La Clemenza looked an odd choice on paper, but this was arguably a more eloquent case for the work than any staged production.The vocal range required of the singer in the role of Vitellia is enormous, but Erraught sang every note perfectly. Using all of the available platform area, Brower and Sala were the dramatic heart of the semi-staging, the latter bringing a remarkable believability to his role. Park and Warenberg’s first act duet was an early melodic highlight and clarinettists Maximiliano Martín and William Stafford were first class in the basset horn solos that partner arias in each act.From the fine overture, deserving of more outings as a concert piece, to the joyous choral conclusion, so obviously of the same year as Mozart’s Requiem, this flawless interpretation shows La Clemenza di Tito to be the work of a composer at his peak.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicEdinburgh festival 2025Scottish Chamber OrchestraOperaWolfgang Amadeus MozartEdinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

I need to express who I am and the impact this war has on me as a person [and] my family,” he says.Nasr was on holiday in Egypt in April 2023 when the war in Sudan broke out and has not been able to return. He still struggles to adapt to life abroad, he says, living in a small home knowing that his large family house in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, has been looted by militia fighters.At least 3.3 million Sudanese have fled Sudan since 2023, with 1.5 million arriving in Egypt,according to the UN, while the remainder are spread throughout Sudan’s other neighbours.While Nasr’s close family escaped Sudan, many of his relatives are among the 8 million internally displaced people.

Decades after it was abandoned, Queen Kelly will now be shown at the Venice film festivalPamela HutchinsonMon 11 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 19.16 EDTShareIn the long history of Hollywood excess, there is no tale as torrid as that of Queen Kelly. This lavish silent melodrama starring Gloria Swanson and directed by Erich von Stroheim will screen as the pre-opening event at this year’sVenice film festival, with a new score by composer Eli Denson. The film is an outlandish saga of illicit love in sordid surroundings – and so is the story of its production.Queen Kelly is set in Europe before the first world war and tells the story of Patricia Kelly (Swanson), a convent girl who falls in love with a prince (British actor Walter Byron) who is engaged to a deranged queen. Patricia is sent away to Tanzania, where she is forced into marriage with a vile character called Jan, later earning the nickname Queen Kelly. It’s a far-fetched tale, which sets a curious tone from the beginning with its infamous meet-cute, in which Patricia is so overawed by meeting the prince that her knickers fall to the ground.On the first day of shooting in 1928, Swanson had a premonition that the film would never be finished, and events proved her correct. The screening at Venice consists of a new restoration by Dennis Doros that incorporates previously unseen material, and some inventive methods of recreating the film’s grand finale. He describes this version as a “reimagining”. Viewers of the film have always had to fill in the gaps, as did those who wanted to learn what happened behind the scenes.View image in fullscreenAs immoderate as ever … Swanson believed Von Stroheim had taken the film in a direction that would never get past the censors.Photograph: Courtesy: Venice BiennaleThe story of the film begins with a love affair. In 1927 Swanson was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, married to French war hero Marquis Henry de la Falaise, when she met the married Boston businessmanJoseph P Kennedy, father of the Kennedy clan. The following year Swanson and Kennedy became lovers, and their relationship was soon an open secret in Hollywood. Swanson, who was living beyond her generous means, put her financial affairs in his hands.Kennedy had been in the movie business for some years, and together they planned a lucrative showcase for Swanson’s talent. Making an expensive silent film when the talkie revolution was already in motion was one questionable decision. The next was hiring Von Stroheim to write and direct it. He was anything but a safe bet, known for his censor-baiting storylines, immense profligacy (insisting the extras in 1922’s Foolish Wives be supplied with silk underwear) and epic running times (his original cut of 1924’s Greed was said to be nine hours long).Von Stroheim proved as immoderate as ever. In the third month of filming, with costs soaring, Swanson and Kennedy called the whole thing off. Her objection was that Von Stroheim had taken the narrative in a direction that would never pass the censors. The scenes they were working on in Africa were clearly set in a brothel. She was exhausted by his reshoots and horrified by having to do a scene in which Jan (Tully Marshall) dribbled tobacco juice on to her hand. She called up Kennedy, saying: “Our director is a madman.” For his part, Von Stroheim claimed the shoot was abandoned purely because the coming of sound rendered this expensive silent film obsolete. Whatever the reason, Swanson and Kennedy cut their losses, which totalled a reputed $800,000.View image in fullscreenFar-fetched … Swanson, left, in Queen Kelly.Photograph: Courtesy: Venice BiennaleVon Stroheim was unceremoniously removed from the project. He would never complete a film as director again, although he would continue to find success as an actor, dubbed the “The Man You Love to Hate” for playing German villains, most notably in Jean Renoir’s 1937 classic La Grande Illusion.Swanson and Kennedy tried to complete the film as a talkie and even a musical. A 1932 cut of Queen Kelly was shown in a few countries, but this was essentially only the film’s first half. Fast-forward to 1950, when Swanson staged her own glorious comeback, playing washed-up silent film star Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder’s black comedy Sunset Boulevard. None other than Von Stroheim was hired to play Norma’s butler, the man who keeps her fantasy of enduring fame alive. And when Wilder needed to use a scene from one of Norma’s old movies? A clip of Queen Kelly was chosen.Swanson was back in the spotlight, and one of her most famous follies was once more a talking point. From then on, she did her best to revive the project she once thought was doomed – screening her cut of the film at one-off events and even on US TV, with the words: “This Queen Kelly gal was a child that somehow didn’t want to be born.” Swanson died in 1983, just two years before Doros completed his first reconstruction. He used Swanson’s own prints and outtakes, which had been preserved at the George Eastman Museum. This new restoration, and its red-carpet premiere in Venice, may just be everything that Swanson dreamed of for her lovechild Queen Kelly. Von Stroheim, one suspects, would prefer to try a few more takes.Queen Kelly screens in Venice on 26 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmVenice film festivalFestivalsThe KennedysFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trivium, Machine Head and Gojira headline this edition of the 20,000-capacity gathering, making for one of the most stacked lineups in recent memory.On Friday, Emperor prove why they’re still black metal’s measuring stick, despite having released no new music since 2001. Such tracks as I Am the Black Wizards are masterpieces of infernal majesty, keyboards blaring while singer/guitarist Ihsahn shrieks and makes his instrument wail. No other band combine adrenaline, anguish and ambition this excellently. Charging back after a Bullet for My Valentine co-headline tourended in ugly fashion, Trivium bring every bell and whistle they can. The Floridians cover Black Sabbath and Metallica, then inflate a gigantic mascot, comparable to Iron Maiden’s Eddie, to hammer home the sense of occasion. Guest appearances from Machine Head, Sleep Token, Malevolence and Emperor members reaffirm these 90 minutes as a proud celebration of all things metal.Machine Head returned to the festival circuit after eight years away with an intimate set at Bloodstock 2022, and on Saturday, the thrashers triumph at full scale. Where Davidian blows through presumably the entire pyro budget, Darkness Within gets thousands of phone torches piercing the air. But the most amazing moment is Halo: a nine-minute labyrinth of harmonies and solos, worthy ofthe extreme metal Mount Rushmore. The band’s crowd-surfer count of 1,011 sets a new festival record.View image in fullscreenThe front row for Gojira.Photograph: Abbi Draper-ScottSunday wraps up with a one-two punch of prog metal. Despiteweathering an acrimonious splitwith founding guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds in March, Mastodon haven’t lost an iota of strength. Temporary member Nick Johnston fits right in, to the point that he and co-shredder Bill Kelliher play rock-paper-scissors during one staccato riff, and Blood and Thunder smacks as mightily as ever. And Gojira’s blazing set is more a victory lap than a statement of intent. In 2018, Bloodstock became the first festival to recognise the crusaders’ headline potential, and they return as proven arena-fillers. Flying Whales and Another World are supercharged yet conscious anthems that hardly need the accompanying cinematic visuals to bolster their impact. The most action-packed weekend on 2025’s heavy metal calendar has come to a very apt close.Explore more on these topicsMetalFestivalsMusic festivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It has made me more present, confident and at ease talking to peopleAngela HuiMon 11 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 09.51 EDTShareI’m an ambivert. No, it’s not some made-up personality type. I enjoy spending time with others and socialising, but I need time alone to recharge. Starting conversations and keeping them flowing smoothly have never come naturally to me. I overthink everything: “Am I speaking too much? I haven’t said anything in the past five minutes. Quick, say something. Oh no, I’ve missed my opening. Wait, why did I say that? That was weird.”These are the thoughts that are constantly swirling in my head mid-conversation, and then I’ll go home, replay it all again and cringe at that one thing I said. I have always been deeply envious of people who can charm and easily work a room. So, in the past year, I’ve set myself a challenge: to compliment a stranger at least once a day – and it has to be genuine.If I see someone wearing something great, I’ll say it’s cute and ask where it’s from. If they’re sporting beautiful lipstick or have great hair, I’ll compliment them and ask for details. Whether it’s a cashier, a barista or someone walking past me, I try to say it out loud instead of just thinking it. The other day, in the queue at Golden Gate Bakery in London’s Chinatown, I told an older Asian woman her perm looked incredible. All bounce, no frizz. We ended up bonding over which bakeries still make proper old-school Chinese pineapple buns.Complimenting someone is a great icebreaker or conversation starter when you don’t know what else to say. And, if I can make someone’s day that bit brighter, that makes me happy. Seeing someone smile because of something I said always lifts my mood. When I started doing it, I was worried it might come off as a bit odd, but it’s got easier. It’s made me feel more confident, more present and more at ease talking to people. And, the truth is, I’m just nosy and curious.The one change that worked: I stopped saying yes to everything – and found a phrase that made it easierRead moreSome of the most memorable compliments I’ve ever received have come from strangers. Even three years after my debut book, Takeaway, came out, I still receive messages from people around the world who tell me my writing moved them or helped them face their own trauma. I’ve even made a “Good Things” folder on my laptop, filled with screenshots of these messages. There’s something powerful about a kind comment from someone who went out of their way to interact with you, even though they didn’t have to say anything at all. We could all use a bit more kindness in the world.This challenge has been as much about pushing myself out of my comfort zone as spreading joy. I wasn’t used to putting myself out there like that and letting go of my self-consciousness. But, the more I leaned into it, the more I realised how much I’d been holding myself back. It has reminded me, too, that the deepest impact can come from the smallest acts of care.

If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend that you do, and not just for the iconic spiked gazpacho scene.

Once all the gazpacho has been sieved, chill the lot in the fridge for at least an hour.Serve in shallow bowls topped with your choice of halved cherry tomatoes, diced strawberries, finely chopped cucumber and ice, along with the croutons and rosemary sprigs.

And when it’s on the label of beauty products, sellers often charge more. “There’s a trend where people assume that synthetically derived ingredients are harmful, and that if something’s labelled ‘natural’ it must be safer or better for your skin,” she says. But that’s often a misconception.For starters, not everything labelled “natural” is entirely sourced from nature. “I came across acrude studythat looked at 100 skincare products on Amazon marketed as natural. Only 42% truly were,” Simpson adds. In fact, most “natural” skincare products contained at least two synthetic ingredients.Some synthetic ingredients are scientifically developed to be more gentle on the skin and to have a reduced chance of causing potential reactionsBeyond this, just because something is sourced from natural ingredients doesn’t mean it’s gentle on every skin type. Though plant-based, ingredients including fragrances and essential oils such as cinnamon, tea tree, peppermint and linalool can cause irritation for some people. Lanolin, a moisturising agent derived from sheep’s wool, is another common allergen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

As I stood knee-deep in the cool Atlantic Ocean, marvelling at the beauty and emptiness of the Plage de Port Lin, I decided this was nonsense: without this little detour, “just to have a look”, I’d never have discovered Le Croisic, on the Guérande peninsula. The downside is that time isn’t on my side: it’s past 5pm and I’m supposed to be at the big resort, La Baule-Escoublac, six miles east by now. But thepresqu’île(a “nearly island”), as the French call it, tucked in the corner where Brittany meets Pays de la Loire, is calling out to be explored.First, though, a late afternoon dip in the sea is too hard to resist, and I wade into the water, sharing a delighted smile with fellow swimmers. Two elderly women in flowery swimming caps nod a cheery “Bonsoir” as I take my first strokes. Afterwards, I wander up the coast a little way. A row of belle epoque villas overlook the rocky coastline, and I climb down on to the sand in front of them to look west at the enchanting view of the small headlands jutting into the sea and scattered black rocks in silhouette.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian GraphicsBack in the car, I hazard that I have just enough time to do a circuit of the peninsula if I delay my evening dinner reservation in La Baule, and so I follow the coast road west, spottingmenhirs, small sandy coves and a golf course along the way. As I approach the town of Le Croisic, there are more people out for a stroll beneath the towering maritime pine trees and I park up again to join them for a while.At the jetty that usually sees passengers boarding thefoot ferryto the islands off the coast, such as Belle-Île-en-Mer and Hoëdic, I notice a crowd of people aren’t queueing, but fishing. Old men and teenage boys are peering over the railings, with nets lowered down on lines; there’s a jolly camaraderie and their chatter carries on the breeze.View image in fullscreenOne of Le Croisic’s squares.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyIn the sea behind them, I spot the Trehic jetty, an 850-metre stone pier that snakes into the bay nearby – its end point marked by a lighthouse – as well as the tip of the Pen Bron peninsula on the other side of the bay, which seems so close it could be within swimming distance. Its proximity reminds me what the two peninsulas embrace: 2,000 hectares (4,940 acres) of marshland and the salt ponds from which the famous Guérande salt crystals are harvested. The thought of sprinkling it on my dinner makes my stomach rumble, and so I head on to La Baule, taking a detour through the main town, along the pretty harbour front with its yachts and quaysides.After checking into theHotel des Dunes, I wander out for dinner. There’s a holiday vibe in the town and restaurants are full of families and friends dining together, black-clad waiters whirling between them with trays aloft. I arrive for my reservation atRestaurant Le M(starter, main course and dessert from €18.90), and tuck into briny oysters from Brittany and grilled fish with Mediterranean vegetables.There’s a holiday vibe with restaurants full of families  dining together, black-clad waiters whirling between them with trays aloftLa Baule-Escoublac first welcomed tourists in the late 19th century, after the opening of the railway line, and became a sophisticated resort. Today, it is a mix of modern apartments, belle epoque-era timber-framed architecture, cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops. Away from the main drags are desirable 19th-century villas shaded by the cypress and pines that were planted in the early 1820s to stabilise the dunes. It is undeniably touristy, but that’s no surprise for a place with such a good beach.The next morning, I wander down to the seafront and inhale the ozone before wandering along the shore, sitting for a while on the golden sand.Some 15 minutes north of La Baule-Escoublac is impressive Guérande – its name familiar from the eponymous salt – with its mighty walls, towers, moats and grand medieval gate,La Porte Saint-Michel. Inside, it is a delight: bunting flutters above streets packed with bakeries, arty boutiques and creperies.View image in fullscreenThe mighty walls and grand gate, La Porte Saint-Michel, in the medieval town of Guérande.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyThe sun is shining, so I take a table in the main square on the terrace of the creperie Chez Lucien and soon I’m tucking into a crispy goldengalette complète, with ham, cheese and a gooey egg at its centre, and a cup of cider. I might strictly be in the region of Pays de la Loire, but the identity here is resolutely Breton, and the salt harvested from the nearby marshes has been a key ingredient in Brittany’s famous salted butter for centuries.To find out more about the fascinating process of harvesting thesel de Guérande, I head out to the marshes. At the shop and visitor centre of theTerre de Selcooperative (salt marsh tours from €10.50), I meet Simon Pereon, apaludieror salt harvester, who has agreed to show me how he and his 220 fellowpaludiersenact the process of salt harvesting between June and September. Salt has been prized in these parts since Roman times, when soldiers were sometimes paid in salt (hence the origin of the word salary), but the marshes as we see them today date from around 1,000 years ago.As we drive to Simon’s ponds, I start to see the appeal of working under the big skies and open air, and the reason he followed in his father’s and grandfather’s footsteps. “The government classes us as ‘farmers’,” he explains, “but we work with seawater and the whole landscape is balanced between the land and the sea.” With a long, toothless rake called alas, he moves the seawater between a labyrinth of shallow rectangular ponds that don’t drain, due to the clay mud beneath, coloured pink by the algae that thrives here. As the water moves between each pond it becomes increasingly concentrated as the sun evaporates the water and leaves the salt behind.View image in fullscreen‘Big skies and open air’ – Marais Salants de Guérande.Photograph: Hilke Maunder/AlamySimon sweeps thelasacross the ponds and the water ripples gently: the process is hypnotic. By the end of each day, he has raked the salt into neat piles on the dykes between ponds. “In summer, we harvest 50kg every day. The job has evolved over the years, with tractors and other machines, but for the actual salt harvesting, we still use the identical process that’s been around for centuries.”The tranquillity has been passed down the ages: I hear little more than the calls from the avocets and ibis in the neighbouring lagoon. “I start at daybreak,” Simon says, “and for the first few hours of the day, I see the sun rise, listen to the birds, and there’s no one around. At the end of the day, too, I just watch the sun go down.”The tranquillity has been passed down the ages: I hear little more than the calls from the avocets and ibis in the lagoonIt sounds like bliss and, after I take another detour later that day through the salt marshes – the clouds in the reddening sky are reflected in the mirror-like ponds – I am reassured that curiosity can only be a good thing.The trip was provided byPays de la Loire Tourism; accommodation provided byHotel des Dunesin La Baule (doublesfrom €65room-only).Brittany Ferrieshas crossings from Portsmouth to St Malo from£229return for a car and two people, including en suite cabin on the outward, overnight legAmuse Bouche: How to Eat Your Way Around France by Carolyn Boyd is publishedby Profile, £10.99.

Then in September, they would watch helplessly as their farmlands were flooded. Some abandoned their farms, frustrated by fluctuating crop yields.For Ouattara, that was not an option. As her family’s breadwinner, proceeds from the farm catered to the needs of her three children as well as requests from other relatives. Then another farmer mentioned a concept called Smart Valleys that had helped solve similar issues and double his income.“Before, I made 2 tonnes a year [and] earned at least 400,000CFA [west African francs, equivalent to £528.60],” said Ouattara, who has since added maize, tomatoes and cucumbers to her portfolio. “But as soon as we put Smart Valleys into practice, I made 4.5 tonnes, which makes me 900,000CFA (£1,189.34).”Smart Valleys is a low-cost initiative by the nonprofit organisation AfricaRicethat aims to help farmers get better control over the water on their land, for example by using channels, in order to reduce flooding and increase yields. It also helps farmers diversify crop production.The programme – backed primarily by Japan’s agriculture ministry – focuses on inland valleys, low-lying areas between hills with fertile soils that are ideal for agriculture but rarely cultivated due to poor water control. Its head, Elliott Dossou-Yovo, said the valleys cover 190m hectares in sub-Saharan Africa, of which only 10% is cultivated.View image in fullscreenCameroonian scientist Sali Atanja Ndindeng (in glasses) heads a programme that receives and analyses samples at the Africa Rice laboratory to produce healthier varieties for the continent.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The Guardian“In the past, farmers were trying to produce rice only once a year and failing,” said Dossou-Yovo. With his team’s support, fields that used to be abandoned during the dry season are cultivated with alternative crops, thereby diversifying farmers’ portfolios and increasing their incomes.Africa Rice, established in 1971, set a goal to double rice production within a decade in 2009, when it changed its name from West Africa Rice Development Association. Since achieving that target, it has ambitiously turned to self-sufficiency for member states by 2030.The core of its work happens a few miles away from Ouattara’s farm at an 800-hectare research campus, where there are facilities including testing sites, a seed science lab and gene bank with 22,000 rice varieties used by scientists to develop improved strains.View image in fullscreenA sign outside the main Africa Rice campus.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The GuardianFunders include the Gates Foundation, the World Bank, and donor partners including Islamic Development Bank and African Development Bank, though member states also make contributions.The need for Africa Rice arose because in the 1960s and 70s, rice consumption and population growth surpassed food production rate in west Africa, Baboucarr Manneh, its Gambian-born director general, said. Today, rice that was previously reserved for feasting occasions, is arguably the continent’s most popular staple.“Rice is very popular because it is easy to cook,” he said. “It used to seem like a luxury food to many consumers, compared with maize and millet. If you go to Sierra Leone, they used to consume a lot of roots and tubers etc, but people now associate those foods with poverty so they prefer rice.”Sali Atanja Ndindeng heads the rice sector development programme, which develops new varieties in conjunction with market trends and analyses samples received from partner institutions in member countries to help identify good grain quality.“Our goal is to make rice not just an energy-dense food, but a nutrient-dense food … and at the same time, reduce the impact of rice causing peaks in glucose levels when people consume it,” he said. One way to do this, the team thinks, is to promote the consumption of parboiled rice – which some studies have shown has a lower impact on blood sugar levels – in countries such as Ivory Coast, where it is historically unpopular, to mirror countries like Nigeria where it is prevalent.Ndindeng’s teams also make pop rice that can be ground to instant flour for children to eat with milk and chocolate as well as rice crackers integrated with local items including ginger, hibiscus, soy and tamarind which are high in zinc and iron, to tackle deficiencies in those micronutrients.Many barriers are holding back member countries from reaching self-sufficiency. For years, cheap imports have flooded African markets from Asia, where producers benefit from heavy subsidies.Africa imports about 40% of rice it consumes – about 15 to 16 million tonnes every year. More than half of the imports come from India alone.In July 2023, India banned rice exports, citing the need to consume more locally. “That created a panic in Africa,” said Manneh. “African ministers had to go to India to negotiate.”Only a fifth of rice fields in Africa use irrigation, with the rest relying on unpredictable rainfall, so member states are being guided on building climate-resilient systems.View image in fullscreenJars of different rices at the Africa Rice laboratory.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The GuardianTanzania is self-sufficient and exporting within east Africa. In west Africa, Nigeria, is close to doing so.Manneh is hoping for more success stories on a national level, but also on an individual level with farmers such as Ouattara, who are still stunned by what science is doing for their lives.“They welcomed me … They guided me and I thank them,” she said.Explore more on these topicsAfricaFoodRicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A hotter climate also causes the atmosphere to suck moisture out of fuel, dead vegetation and the forest floor – creating ideal conditions for fires to start, he explained.“It means more of the material is dried out, is available to burn when the fire does come, it leads to bigger flames, higher intensity, which gets to be difficult to impossible to extinguish,” he said.So far, the worst of the fires have been concentrated in the prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, which together account for about 60% of the hectares burned so far this year in Canada.Tens of thousands of people in communities across the country have been evacuated due to the wildfires. In Saskatchewan, the Canadian Red Cross reported it had assisted more than 17,000 people in the province from over 6,700 households to evacuate.Thirteen communities in north-west Saskatchewan are under an evacuation order, several of which are First Nations, according to the province. One of the most affected areas of this year’s wildfire season in the province is Denare Beach, a north-eastern village that was mostly destroyed in June due to a blaze.The season has also now hit the east coast of Canada, as wildfires are currently raging across Newfoundland and Labrador and several towns are under evacuation orders.John Abatzoglou, a professor of complex systems management at the University of California, Merced, co-authored the June report from United Nations University.Abatzoglou said this year’s fire season is the third year in a row Canada has seen fire activity that is well above average. The fires are also causing widespread smoke to cascade from the country into the United States as well,prompting severe air quality warningsin several states this month, is also an indication of how the fires are hurting populations beyond evacuations.It’s an international element of the fires that officials are having to contend with on a wider scale, Abatzoglou said.“This is a really key point that’s different from other natural hazards and its ability to impact everything from quality of life to … human health and even mortality,” he said.Governments and public health officials will have to address how to change public behaviour and public policy to contend with “smoke days”, where you have to stay inside, he said.“I know communities that may not have great infiltration systems … so more efforts there to provide resources to communities so that they can be safe indoors during acute smoke periods.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaWildfiresAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In footage of his arrest, the teenager was heard shouting that he had been hired by a local drug dealer and claiming “I did it for money for my family”.Authorities have stressed they are pursuing the “intellectual authors” of the attack, and at least three adults are facing charges of using a minor to commit a crime. Colombia’s national police director, Carlos Fernando Triana, said another arrested man, Élder José Arteaga Hernández, known as El Costeño, was among those who had orchestrated the attack.The defence ministry has offered a 3bn peso (about £550,000) reward for information leading to the identification and capture of the culprits, and said the US, Britain and the United Arab Emirates were helping with the investigation.Colombia’s leftwing president, Gustavo Petro,offered his condolencesto Uribe’s family, saying: “Life is above any ideology.” He said: “For decades, revenge has fuelled violence. No more. Miguel’s death hurts us as if he were one of our own. It is a defeat.”Assassination attempt in Colombia sparks fears of return to bloody past: ‘It’s a devastating moment’Read moreThe assassination was the worst incident of political violence in Colombia in two decades and hasreignited fearsof a return to the country’s bloody past when organised crime and rebel groups murdered political candidates, journalists and judges with impunity. Between 1986 and 1990, five presidential candidates were murdered, while grassroots political activity was frequently targeted.Uribe’s mother, the journalist Diana Turbay, was killed in 1991 during a botched rescue mission after she was kidnapped by the Medellín cartel, headed by the drug lord Pablo Escobar.“If my mother was willing to give her life for a cause, how could I not do the same in life and in politics?” Uribe, who was five when his mother was killed, said in aninterview last year.Despite a 2016 peace deal between the government and the country’s main rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), violence has continued and new groups have emerged into the vacuum. Earlier this year, fighting between two armed groups near the Venezuelan border led to the displacement of more than 50,000 people. In June, a wave of bomb attacks across Cali, the country’s third largest city, and several nearby towns killed at least seven people and wounded 50.Uribe hailed from one of Colombia’s most prominent political families – he was the grandson of the former president Julio César Turbay Ayala – and enjoyed a rapid political rise. The lawyer, who held a master’s degree from Harvard University, entered politics as a Bogotá councillor aged 25 and by 2022 he had secured the highest number of votes within the conservative Democratic Centre party.Known for his sharp criticism of Petro, Uribe argued for a hardline approach to armed groups. He was not considered a frontrunner in the upcoming presidential vote, the first round of which is due in May.Isaac Morales, of the Bogotá-based Peace and Reconciliation Foundation, which monitors political-electoral violence, said: “With Uribe Turbay’s death, democracy in Colombia is lost and the electoral outlook for 2026 is very uncertain.”María José Pizarro, a leftwing senator whose father was assassinated on the presidential campaign trail in 1990,saidthat while Uribe “represented ideas different from mine”, his “voice deserved respect in the democratic arena”.She said: “Unpatriotic minorities continue to kill, understanding only the language of violence and seeking to influence the nation’s destiny with bloodshed.”Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Combined with parched soils, the conditions are ideal for the spread of wildfires.1:10Firefighters tackle wildfires across southern Europe – videoIn Aude, Occitanie, a blaze that started on 5 August grew to an area the size of Paris within days, becoming France’s largest wildfire for 75 years. One person died and 13 others were injured, 11 of them firefighters.A broad high-pressure system shifting east across the continent is expected to sweep the warm airmass north and east, lifting temperatures 10-15C above average in northern France, England, Benelux and central and eastern Europe this week.On Tuesday, swaths of France will reach 35-40C, with some areas climbing to the low 40s, while parts of Spain andPortugalcould hit 43-44C. Hot weather is then expected to stretch into Germany and western Poland on Wednesday and Thursday, where it is likely to reach the low-to-mid 30s.With southern and south-western Europe already enduring intense heat, the arrival of this warm air into central and eastern parts is likely to mark the start of a widespread hot spell that could persist for several days.View image in fullscreenArid conditions in Harrington, Maine, have been affecting blueberry growers.Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, wildfires have continued to burn in Greece and Turkey, and across the Atlantic dry conditions have intensified North America’s wildfire season.In late June, a regional monitor reported drought conditions in 22% of Mexico, 34% ofCanada(excluding Nunavut) and 27% of the US, affecting nearly 60 million people in total, with the worst-hit areas in western parts of the continent.Many wildfires are burning in these areas, including most of Canada’s 714 active fires, bringing widespread poor air quality and low visibility.A drought assessment in Canada showed eastern regions were largely spared at the end of June. However, rainfall in the region has been significantly below average since early summer.Now, with temperatures 10-15C higher than normal in parts of the east, there is increasing concern about water shortages and new fires.Explore more on these topicsSpainWeather trackerPortugalEuropeCanadaAmericasanalysisShareReuse this content"

The length of the largest and most endangered freshwater giants, some as big as grizzly bears, decreased by 40% in seven years.Some fish, like the Mekong giant catfish, have been studied for over a longer period and show a decline in weight of 55% in the past 25 years, dropping from an average of 180kg (397lb) to 80kg.One of the study team, the biologist Ngor Peng Bun, helped catch a gigantic catfish in 2000 that weighed 270kg, before tagging and releasing it. “It was enormous – unforgettable,” he said, and nearly capsized his boat. The species, known in Khmer as trey reach, or royal fish, is now a shadow of its former self.View image in fullscreenThe 270kg Mekong giant catfish that the biologist Ngor Peng Bun helped catch in 2000, before tagging and releasing it.Photograph: Zeb HoganThe giant barb, the world’s largest carp and Cambodia’s national fish, has shown a similar trajectory. Both species are critically endangered.Size is a matter of survival because large fish – which are more likely to be caught – produce exponentially more eggs, the scientists said. A 300kg catfish can produce 10 to 20 times more offspring than a 50kg fish, for example. Many of the largest species are also long-lived and slow to mature, meaning increases in deaths can tip the balance towards population collapse.The Mekong giants are crucial for the river’s ecosystem but also central to the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on fishing. The scientists did find a sign of hope when in 2022 a fisher caught and released a record-breaking 300kg stingray. It was thelargest freshwater fish ever seenand showed that some giants still remain.View image in fullscreenA giant freshwater stingray, weighing 181kg, is caught and released in the Mekong in Cambodia.Photograph: Chhut Chheana/Wonders of the Mekong/AFP/Getty ImagesFishing and huntingoften targets the largest animalsand has led to the shrinking of many species includingcod in the Baltic Sea,salmon in Alaskaandsharks, and has led tosmaller tusks in African elephants.Dr Zeb Hogan, a research associate professor at the University of Nevada, US, and part of the study team, said the rapid shrinking of the Mekong megafish was surprising and shocking.“We’ve seen this pattern in the Atlantic cod fishery, where decades of size-selective fishing removed the largest, most fertile fish, resulting in a dramatic collapse. As body size and reproductive capacity decline, [the Mekong] fish risk entering a ‘death spiral’, in which populations persist but are no longer viable,” Hogan said.Sophorn Uy, at the Royal University of Agriculture in Phnom Penh and also part of the team, said: “Knowing these giants are shrinking, both in size and number, is like losing a small piece of Cambodia itself. Their existence carries deep cultural and ecological significance.”The study, which ispublished in the journal Biological Conservation, analysed seven years of monitoring data from 23 sites in the lower Mekong basin and included 257 species of fish. Full data was available from 2007-14. Hogan said the shrinking trend was likely to have continued.View image in fullscreenAs well as overfishing, the Mekong megafish are struggling with dams, which block their migration to spawning grounds.Photograph: Andy Eames/APAs well as overfishing, the Mekong megafish are struggling with dams, which block their migration to spawning grounds; the climate crisis, which is upsetting the seasonal triggers of temperature and rainfall; and the destruction of seasonally flooded forests for farming, which are an important habitat.Hogan said: “That 300kg stingray showed us that it’s not too late. New records are still being set. But they will mean little unless we act now to protect these species and the river system they call home. The future of the Mekong’s giants hangs in the balance.”The stingray was tagged and tracked for two years, which it spent in a protected area along a 3-mile (5km) stretch of river. “Connectivity [along rivers] and protected habitat – that’s the holy grail,” said Hogan. “If you have those, then these fish can survive.”Catching the megafish is already illegal in some countries through which the Mekong flows, but enforcement remains a big challenge, the scientists said. “Local fishers were essential to gathering our data,” said Sophorn. “They are on the frontlines and must be part of the solution.”Explore more on these topicsFishRiversFishingWildlifeAsia PacificConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

The agency spoke to elderly farmers who said they feared they would struggle to find a stable livelihood.The sprawling golf resort, the first project by the Trump Organization in Vietnam, broke ground as the country scrambled to reach a crucial trade deal with the US.Vietnam, which is heavily dependent on exports, was facing the threat of a 46% tariff in April, which has since beenreduced to 20%for many goods.Vietnam’s prime minister said the project played an important role in deepening the country’s relationship with the US and that villagers would be reimbursed. Pham Minh Chinh added that he hoped the development would create jobs and improve livelihoods.The project will include a 54-hole VIP golf course, luxury resorts, high-end villas and a modern urban complex, according to state media. Reactions among local people have been mixed, with many farmers suggesting the compensation rates are too low.The New York Timesreported in Maythat the development had been approved unusually fast and was allowed to break ground even thoughat least half a dozen legally required steps, including environmental reviews, had not been conducted.The White House has denied suggestions of a conflict of interest, saying the business deals of the Trump Organization are entirely separate from trade negotiations and that Donald Trump’s assets are in a trust managed by his children.However, disclosures in June showed income from those sources ultimately accrues to the president.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The event’s organising body issued a severe reprimand to the school in March after its internal investigation found that four students had assaulted a younger boy at a dormitory in January.Amid stifling summers Japan warns of future restrictions on children’s sportRead moreThe revelations sparked a backlash on social media that included calls for the team’s expulsion, as well as a bomb threat and incidents in which Koryo students had been chased on their way to and from school.The summer tournament at Koshien stadium near Osaka features 49 teams and is one of the highlights of Japan’s sporting calendar, drawing huge attendances and TV audiences in the millions.The event, first held in 1915, has launched the careers of a string of famous Japanesebaseballplayers, including the Los Angeles Dodgers superstarShohei Ohtani.Koryo’s principal, Masakazu Hori, told reporters that the school had decided to withdraw to protect students and staff. Describing the assault case as “deeply regrettable”, he added: “We have decided to pull out, and will swiftly conduct an overhaul of our education method.”The school’s investigation found that the unnamed boy had been shoved in the chest and slapped in the face, Japanese media said. He transferred to another school after his assailants apologised.The school reported the incident to the federation, which issued a reprimand but did not initially make it public.Police are reportedly investigating the January incident after the victim filed a complaint, and a third-party body is examining additional allegations made by a former member of the team.The baseball team’s head coach, Tetsuyuki Nakai, has been relieved of his duties while the investigation is being carried out.The education minister, Toshiko Abe, voiced “deep regret” over the “inexcusable” actions of the students, but warned social media users not to post unfounded allegations against people connected to the school.It is not the first time that the tournament – Japan’s biggest amateur sporting event – has found itself at the centre of allegations of abuse, which critics claim lie in its refusal to ditch its regimented approach to sport.In 2015, PL Gakuen high school, one of the tournament’s most successful teams, said it would stop recruiting new players after allegations of violence and bullying.In 2023, the coach of another top team was forced to step down after being accused of physical abusing a player. And last month, players competing in a qualifying game for the Koshien tournament were ordered not to smile and wave at supporters during an opening ceremony, and instead march in an orderly fashion.The tournament’s organiser, the Japan High SchoolBaseballFederation, said it would “continue efforts to eradicate violence, bullying and unreasonable hierarchical relationships”.Koryo, which has a tradition of producing professional players, is the first school in the tournament’s long history to withdraw after the games have started.The withdrawal means that Koryo will forfeit its second-round game, which had been scheduled for Thursday. Ina clipon social media, several members of the team Koryo defeated in their first-round fixture last week refused to observe the custom of shaking hands with their opponents at the end of the game.Explore more on these topicsJapanBaseballBullyingAsia PacificYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

That came off the back of three out of four years with rainfall well above average, including 2022 – the city’s wettest on record.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe NSW east coast was generally “quite a wet place”, said University of Melbourne associate professor Andrew King, but for many residents – particularly from the mid-north coast upwards – this year had been rainier than usual.“We have seen some really major rain events this year,” he said.

Sydney was the third-wettest capital city after Darwin and Brisbane.But that wasn’t the whole picture, How said. August had been a completely different story inland. It was very wet in the east, but also very dry in the west, with many places receiving “next to no rainfall so far this month”.The Bureau’slong-range forecastfor September to November anticipated above-average rainfall would continue for the eastern two-thirds of Australia, with an increased chance of unusually high rainfall (in the highest 20% of records between 1981 and 2018) for parts of eastern Queensland, NSW, south-east SA and northern Victoria.With northern Australia expected to get wetter, and the south-west of the country drier due to global heating, the projections for rainfall in NSW weren’t as clearcut, King said.At least in the short term – for the week ahead – Sydneysiders could at least look forward to one or two fine days. “The good news is that the heaviest of the rain is now behind us,” How said, with drier days returning and Friday likely to be the “pick of the week”.Explore more on these topicsAustralia weatherAustralian climate and environment in focusSydneyNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Sunlight also plays a role in triggering bleaching.Corals can survive bleaching if temperatures are not too extreme or prolonged. But extreme marine heatwaves can kill corals outright.Coral bleaching can also have sub-lethal effects, including increased susceptibility to disease and reduced rates of growth and reproduction.Scientists say the gaps between bleaching events are becoming too short to allow reefs to recover.Coral reefs are considered one of the planet’s ecosystems most at risk from global heating. Reefs support fisheries that feed hundreds of millions of people, as well as supporting major tourism industries.The world’s biggest coral reef system – Australia’s Great Barrier Reef – has suffered seven mass bleaching events since 1998, of which five were in the past decade.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Dr James Gilmour, a senior research scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science that coordinates the monitoring group, said on some coral reefs that were inspected, more than 90% of corals had either bleached or died.“When you have more than about 75% of corals that have bleached or died, it can be very hard to find any healthy corals,” he said.The update from the WACoralBleaching Group said the amount of bleaching and coral death on reefs ranged from medium (11%- 30%) to extreme (greater than 90%) across systems up to 1,500km apart.The worst-hit area was the Rowley Shoals, Gilmour said – a group of three remote reefs that had previously escaped the effects of global heating and had been a “hope spot” for many scientists.A map shows the location of coral reefs across WA that experienced severe levels of coral bleaching and death.The location of coral reefs across WA that experienced severe levels of coral bleaching and death during the 2024/25 summer marine heatwave.“The first time reefs bleach badly, the mortality tends to be quite high,” he said.Throughout the heatwave, scientists were monitoring a metric over reefs known as Degree Heating Weeks – a measure of accumulated heat stress.Gilmour said as a general rule, 8DHWs is high enough to cause some corals to die. During the marine heatwave, most WA reefs from Ningaloo north reached at least 15 DHWs, with some reefs off the Pilbara coast hitting 30DHWs.“At pretty much all of these reefs, it was the highest heat stress ever recorded,” he said.The marine heatwave in WA coincided with the most widespread global bleaching event on record that started in January 2023 and is ongoing.More than 80% of the planet’s reefshave seen heat stress high enough to cause corals to bleach.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scientists there have recorded the biggest annual drops in coral cover“Climate change is driving these events, which are becoming more frequent, more intense and more widespread, giving our amazing, valuable coral reefs little time to recover,” Gilmour said. “And they need 10 to 15 years to recover fully.“The key to helping coral reefs survive under climate change is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”Explore more on these topicsWestern AustraliaMarine lifeOceansClimate crisisCoralnewsShareReuse this content"

Who are they even for? – videoThe commission said it “repeatedly” heard during consultations that the tools and resources available to teachers varied between jurisdictions and sectors, while not all states and territories had developed lesson planning materials to share through a database.The commonwealth should invest and promote a single online platform containing the materials, the report said, with the understanding plans would be adapted for local contexts and for the wide range of students’ abilities.The commission also said the federal government should take the lead in devising a national approach to education technology in schools, including tools using artificial intelligence.“Effective implementation of both reforms requires collaboration and buy-in from state and territory governments, school sectors, school leaders and teachers,” the report said.De Fontenay said the inquiry had revealed a lack of coordination around how to use AI in the classroom.“What we found is that all the states are on a journey. A lot of them are at the (stage) of trying to ban the use of GenAI, with various levels of success,” she said.While some state school directorates arefocused on the risks, others are developing their own GenAI tools, including Educhat in NSW.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“Teachers are in avery difficult situationright now,” De Fontenay said.“All continue to experiment and try out different technologies, but in the midst of the fear there islots of potentialas well.“For a kid who is struggling, AI can tailor the next question based on how they are doing on earlier questions, and then give them work that targets their weaknesses.“There’s a lot of potential, but there are always risks. This has to be a collective agreement in terms of how to proceed.”A week out from treasurer Jim Chalmers’ economic reform roundtable, the commission also recommended easing regulatory restrictions around the jobs Australians are able to perform, which it said were exacerbating skills shortages.“They should start by considering occupations – including motor vehicle repairers, painters and decorators, and hairdressers – where OERs [occupational entry regulations] apply in only some jurisdictions and are not demonstrably improving outcomes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Audits are a good example. Right now the level of auditor requirements are the same as if you are auditing BHP or a small enterprise. We think there should be a lower tier risk of licence with simpler requirements,” she said.In aged care, the demands and expense of educational requirements could be a barrier to somebody with a natural aptitude, De Fontenay said.“We don’t want to see people who are really suited to this type of work prevented by excessive entry requirements.“And in particular, we’d like to see in remote communities that it’s easier for people to receive culturally safe care from people in their communities.”The interim report also proposed initiatives to boost the skills of those already in the workforce.The commission recommended providing financial incentives, potentially in the form of a tax credit, to small and medium-sized businesses who invest in training their staff.The report also backed better recognition of prior education and making it easier for students to claim credit for other study.“AI is very much on everyone’s minds, but occupational change has been a big feature of labour markets here and overseas,” De Fontenay said.“We need to prepare people to change occupations when their preferences change, or when their professions shrink or evolve.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian educationProductivity CommissionnewsShareReuse this content"

In France, which brought its biggest fire since 1949 under control on Sunday, authorities reported that one person had died in the blaze, while 20 firefighters and five civilians had been injured.In the Balkans, Croatian officials praised the “superhuman” efforts of firefighters as they put out a large fire near Split on Monday, while Serbian meteorologists warned of “extreme conditions” for fires to develop amid temperatures of up to 40C.Wildfiresin Albania and Montenegro also forced people to flee their homes, according to local media reports.View image in fullscreenFirefighters tackling a wildfire near Yeres, north-western Spain, on Sunday.Photograph: UME/AFP/Getty ImagesInSpain, fires that broke out in León and Zamora on Sunday forced more than 1,000 people to flee their homes, while large fires continued to burn in Galicia.Cristina Santín Nuño, a fire scientist at the Spanish National Research Council, said the large number of blazes was “to be expected” after a wet spring that helped plants grow was followed by extreme heat, strong winds and long periods without rain.“If we add to this the relatively easy possibility that a spark can ignite a fire somewhere … we have all the ingredients for the ‘molotov cocktail’ we’re seeing right now,” she said.French forecasters said heat records were likely to be broken on Monday and Tuesday as temperatures pass 42C in the south-west. Temperatures hit a record high of 41.4C in the village of Tourbes, near Béziers, at the weekend.In Spain, temperatures on Monday were expected to rise further in the Ebro basin, the southern and eastern thirds of the Iberian peninsula, and the eastern Cantabrian Sea. They were forecast to fall in the north-west, particularly in Galicia.The weather agency said it expected heat of 37-39C across the interior of the Iberian peninsula on Monday, with maximum temperatures above 40C in the interior of the Basque Country and highs that could reach above 44C in the lower Guadalquivir.Jesús Santiago Notario del Pino, a soil scientist at the University of La Laguna, said conditions of “extreme and prolonged heat” had primed the large number of fires across the country by drying out fuel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the US president expressed frustration with Volodymyr Zelenskyy for putting conditions on such a potential agreement.During a news conference at the White House on Monday, Trump said he was frustrated with Zelenskyy’s insistence thatUkrainewould need to hold a national referendum on any peace deal that stipulated recognising Russian control over territory that it has occupied during the war.“I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelenskyy was saying I have to get constitutional approval,” Trump said. “He has approval to go to war and kill everybody but he needs approval to do a land swap. Because there will be some land swapping going on. I know that throughRussiaand through conversations with everybody.”European diplomats have been taken aback by the lack of clarity on the US side about the territories Putin is demanding from Ukraine and the terms of a ceasefire. The discrepancies within the US reporting back on what Russia is seeking has alarmed European diplomats and only added to a fear that Trump, inflating his personal relationship with Putin, could make damaging concessions.Describing his vision for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said an agreement would include “good stuff, not bad stuff, also some bad stuff for both”. “We’re going to change the lines, the battle lines,” he added.Trump,increasingly impatientwith Putin in recent months, has long said he does not see a ceasefire occurring until he meets the Russian leader in person.The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, on Monday invited Trump to join emergency virtual talks with EU leaders and Zelenskyy on Wednesday, as European demands grow for the US president to agree red lines before Friday’s summit with Putin.Neither Zelenskyy nor European leaders have been invited to Trump’s meeting with the Russian president.Trump said on Monday that he would seek to arrange direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy, a proposal that the Russian president has rejected so far.“The next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and Putin, or Zelenskyy and Putin and me. I’ll be there if they need, but I want to have a meeting set up between the two leaders,” Trump said.He said a deal may not be possible and that he saw the upcoming summit as a “feel-out meeting”, and that he would update Zelenskyy and European leaders if Putin proposed a “fair deal”. “I’ll call him after and I may say lots of luck, keep fighting, or I may say we can make a deal,” he said.Merz’s office said in a statement that the virtual talks would focus on “further options for action to put pressure on Russia” and “preparations for possible peace negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security”.It is not clear whether or not Trump has accepted the invitation to the call.EU foreign ministers were meeting in an emergency session to underscore the demand. The UK has also been pressing for wider consultations after Trump unilaterally announced last week that he was going ahead with his first meeting with Putin since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.European leaderssay Russia represents an existential threat to the continent and that they should not be excluded from the process. Issues such as the terms of a ceasefire, further sanction pressure on Russia, any proposed territorial swaps and security guarantees for Ukraine would be discussed with the US president in the virtual meeting.There is concern that an unpredictable Trump will be lured into making fatal concessions to Putin, and the meeting would be a chance for him to map out his strategy.The Polish prime minister,Donald Tusk, said he was optimistic that the US president would formally consult European leaders before his meeting, and said the summit between Trump and Putin filled him with hope and fear.Mutual inconvenience: why Alaska for the Trump-Putin summit on Ukraine?Read moreBrussels’ top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said: “President Trump is right to say that Russia must end its war against Ukraine. The United States has the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously.” But she added: “Any agreement between the United States and Russia must include Ukraine and the EU because it is a security issue for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe.”Radosław Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, also asserted Europe’s relevance, saying: “Europe is paying for Ukraine to defend itself and we are sustaining the Ukrainian state. This is a matter of existential European security interests. We appreciate President Trump’s efforts but we will be taking our own decisions here in Europe. To get to a fair peace, Russia has to limit its war aims.”The White House is insisting that theAlaskameeting is to gauge whether Putin is willing to make concessions for peace, including on accepting western security guarantees for Ukraine, an acceptance that would acknowledge the long-term legitimacy of the Kyiv government led by Zelenskyy.Merz spoke with Trump on Sunday night to underline that he would prefer the US to impose further economic sanctions on Moscow before the talks. He also said he assumed Zelenskyy would be involved in any talks, but for Moscow it would be a concession for a Russian delegation to hold talks with the Ukrainian president since its invasion is predicated on not recognising the legitimacy of the government.A joint statement on Saturday from the leaders from France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Britain, Finland and the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, urged Trump to put more pressure on Russia and stressed: “The path in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.”Putin will go into Friday’s talks believing he is making progress on the battlefield, Trump is desperate for a settlement and the Ukrainian people are also increasingly willing to make concessions for peace. But the Russian president also knows that if he makes no substantive offer, Trump will be under real political pressure to go ahead with long-promised broader economic sanctions against Russia.Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator behind a congressional plan to impose secondary sanctions on countries that trade with Russia, expressed confidence that Trump would protect Ukraine’s interests at the summit. He was involved in the weekend diplomacy and is trusted as an intermediary with Trump by Ukrainian officials.He said if Putin did not offer concessions, he expected Trump to make countries importing Russian oil pay a heavy price, adding that this applied not just to India but also to China and Brazil. India is already due to face50% tariffs later this month.Speaking on NBC, Graham said: “Militarily, we need to keep Ukraine strong, keep flowing them strong and modern weapons, and security guarantees with European forces on the ground as tripwires to prevent a third [Russian] invasion. We want to end this with the sovereign, independent, self-governing Ukraine, and a situation where Putin cannot do this the third time without being crushed.”He added: “I want to be honest with you, Ukraine is not going to evict every Russian, and Russia is not going to Kyiv, so there will be some land swaps at the end.”Ukraine’s leadership has long said that de facto it will not recover all the territory it has lost in successive Russian invasions, but with European support it is fiercely resisting a Russian demand that it should hand over territory in the Donetsk region it has not yet ceded on the battlefield, especially if there are no security guarantees for Ukraine or compensating land swaps by Russia.Europeans are insisting that no limitations can be imposed on Ukraine developing its own military capabilities or the support it receives from third countries, including some inside Nato.Explore more on these topicsUkraineDonald TrumpRussiaVladimir PutinEuropeAlaskaDonald TusknewsShareReuse this content"

Equivalent guidance has been issued to Border Force officers and published online.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumBrexitHome OfficeEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Cook Islands-registered tanker is understood to be part of Russia’s “shadow fleet” – comprising vessels that sail under foreign flags to evade sanctions.The ship was carrying oil from Ust-Luga in Russia across the Gulf of Finland when, prosecutors allege, it dragged its anchoralong the seabedfor about 90km (56 miles) in December 2024.The incident was one of several suspected hybrid attacks on telecommunications services in the Nordic region at the end of last year, putting leaders on high alert and prompting accusations of infrastructure sabotage againstRussia.Finnish authorities seized the Eagle S on 26 December last year when the border guard’s emergency response team and police landed on the ship in the early hours of the morning.‘Shadow fleets’ and subaquatic sabotage: are Europe’s undersea internet cables under attack?Read moreThe seizure was lifted in February and the ship left Finland the following month.Damage to the cables had cost their owners, Cinia and Elisa, “at least €60m in repair costs alone”, the office of the deputy prosecutor general, Jukka Rappe, said in a statement.It added: “The rupture of the extremely high-capacity electricity transmission and telecommunications cables is also suspected of having caused a serious danger to energy supply and telecommunications in Finland, although services have been secured by using alternative connections.”The defendants, it said, had denied any wrongdoing in the preliminary investigation. They believed that Finland “does not have jurisdiction in the matter because the cable damage sites are outside Finnish territorial waters”, the statement said.A lawyer for the United Arab Emirates-based Caravella LLC FZ, the owner of the Eagle S, has said previously that Helsinki lacked jurisdiction to intervene.Rappe disagreed, saying: “The characteristics of the crimes,ie the dangers caused, occurred within the borders of Finland, even though the measures themselves were taken outside Finland.”He told the Guardian that the question of jurisdiction was “one of the critical questions”, but that “the effects of the crime materialised here in Finland. That brings it to the jurisdiction of Finland, I think. But of course it is up to [the] district court to decide whether Finland has jurisdiction or not.”He said he hoped the trial would have an impact on investigations into other alleged cable-cutting incidents in the region over the last two years. Because of its geographical positioning, between Russia and the Baltic, Finland is particularly vulnerable. “Finland is like an island because of the Baltic sea. All of our connections go via undersea cables to Sweden, Estonia and centralEurope,” said Rappe.The indictment has been filed with the Helsinki district court, which will decide on a date for the hearing. The state prosecutor, special prosecutor and regional prosecutor have been assigned to prosecute the charges in court.The three suspects have been under a travel ban in Finland since the start of the investigation.Cinia and Elisa declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsFinlandRussiaEstoniaEuropeTelecomsnewsShareReuse this content"

The most recent was the 28-year-old Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif,killed on Sunday in his makeshift newsroom outside a hospital, along with four colleagues.Press freedom groups and journalists say those killings are part of a campaign of intimidation to shut down vital reporting, which Israel has justified internationally with smears and false claims that the targets were undercover Hamas fighters.With international reporters barred from independent reporting in Gaza – a handful have been allowed in under Israeli military escort, but they are not allowed to move freely or speak to Palestinians – the work done by journalists in Gaza is critical.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I have no doubt that the prevention of international access, the killings of journalists, the targeting of media facilities, the punishment of [Israeli] outlets like Haaretz is part of a deliberate strategy on the part of Israel to conceal what is happening inside Gaza,” said the CPJ chief executive, Jodie Ginsberg.She pointed to a recent incident when a BBC crew reported from a Jordanian military plane dropping humanitarian aid into Gaza – but wasbarred by Israel from filming the devastation below.“We had the example of the international news crews being allowed to film the airdrops but not the devastation when the doors opened.”In July, Sharif, one of the most prominent journalists still working in Gaza, went viral on social media when he broke down on air covering starvation. Passersby urged him to keep going because he gave Gaza a voice.Soon after, an Israeli military spokesperson revived allegations – first aired in 2024 – that he was a militant, including accusing him of faking mass hunger in a “false Hamas campaign on starvation”.The CPJ issued astark warningthat those Israeli claims were a death threat.“These latest unfounded accusations represent an effort to manufacture consent to kill Sharif,” CPJ regional director Sara Qudah said at the time. “This is not the first time Sharif has been targeted by the Israeli military, but the danger to his life is now acute.”Sharif had also anticipated his own death and described it as retaliation for his reporting in a statement released on social media. “If these words reach you, know that Israel has succeeded in killing me and silencing my voice,” he wrote.Israel has published a dossier of documents it says were recovered from Gaza and link Sharif to Hamas. They end in 2021, two years before the war began, and do not even attempt to address his regular appearances live on camera.A role as one of the most prominent journalists in one of the most closely surveilled places on Earth would be strikingly difficult to combine with command of a Hamas unit during an all-out war.Documents Israel published after killing another Al Jazeera journalist last yearclaimedIsmail al-Ghoul was given a military rank when he was 10 years old.While they marshalled contradictory and unconvincing evidence, the existence of those files reflected Israeli concerns about pressure from western allies, and the need for at least the appearance of compliance with international law.Despite international pressure, Israel has not offered any explanation for the deaths of Sharif’s four colleagues, protected civilians killed in their workplace. Ginsberg said she feared that was a warning that already unimaginable risks had escalated further.“What’s astonishing to me is they’ve not even attempted to justify the other killings,” she said. “So they’re admitting to murdering those journalists, knowing they were journalists.“I think this is deliberately intended to have a chilling effect to show that Israel can do what it likes, and nobody will take any action.“If we are now at a stage where Israel can so brazenly target an entire news crew, what does that mean for the safety of any of the other journalists who are operating there. Who is next?”French historian Jean-Pierre Filiu, given rare permission to enter Gaza for academic research during the conflict, said a month researching there had also convinced him that Israel is trying to silence reporting from Gaza.“Now I understand why Israel is denying the international press access to such an appalling scene,” hesaidin an interview with Haaretz after the trip.“Even though I have been in a number of war zones in the past, from Ukraine to Afghanistan, via Syria, Iraq and Somalia, I have never, but never, experienced anything like this.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaJournalist safetyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Several were high-profile veterans, but many were newcomers to the profession.The Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent non-profit organisation based in the US that promotes press freedom worldwide, says at least186 journalists and media workershave been killed in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel and Lebanon since the war began, making it thedeadliest period for journalistssince it began gathering data in 1992. Most have been Palestinians in Gaza, where more than 60,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Israel’s continuing offensive. Others put the toll higher.The CPJ accuses Israel of directly targeting and killing 20 journalists and media workers. Any deliberate attack on a civilian could constitute a war crime, experts say. Israel, which has refused to let international media into Gaza, denies the accusation.Journalists and media workers killed in GazaAnas al-SharifView image in fullscreenAnas al-Sharif reporting from Gaza City in October 2024.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesAnas al-Sharifwas killed in a tent for journalistsoutside al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on Sunday night. Seven people were killed in the attack, including another Al Jazeera correspondent, Mohammed Qreiqeh and the camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa, according to the Qatar-based broadcaster.‘If these words reach you … Israel has succeeded in killing me’: the last words of a journalist killed in GazaRead moreSharif, 28, is one of the most high-profile media casualties of the war in Gaza so far, reaching huge audiences with his reports for Al Jazeera and with more than 500,000 followers on X. His father was killed by an Israeli strike on the family home in Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza City in December 2023. Sharif said at the time that he would continue to report and refused to leave northern Gaza.In a July broadcast he cried on air as a woman behind him collapsed from hunger. “I am talking about slow death of those people,” he said.His final post on X read: “Relentless bombardment … For two hours, the Israeli aggression has intensified on Gaza City.” He leaves a wife and two young children.The Israeli military, citing “intelligence and documents from Gaza, including rosters, terrorist training lists and salary records”, said Sharif was “a Hamas operative integrated into Al Jazeera”.Ismail Abu HatabView image in fullscreenIsmail Abu Hatab.Photograph: PYALARA/FacebookIsmail Abu Hatab, 32, was killedin an Israeli airstrike on al-Baqa cafeon the seashore in Gaza City in June, along with 33 other people.The photographer and film-maker, a graduate of Gaza’s University College of Applied Sciences, had sustained serious injuries to his leg in a November 2024 attack on his office in the al-Ghifari tower in Gaza City but had made a slow, painful recovery.He had worked for numerous international media organisations, exhibited in the US and Spain, and launched a platform to bring art by Palestinians in Gaza to an international audience. He had also curated an exhibition in Los Angeles which portrayed life in Gaza during the war.“I have seen so much death. The mass graves and the final farewells, these things affect me deeply,” he told an Indian reporter in October 2024. “How can one group of people decide the fate of another and kill them in this way?” .The Israeli military said the strike on the cafe had targeted a meeting of Hamas commanders.Fatma HassounaView image in fullscreenFatma Hassouna.Photograph: @fatma_hassona2/instagramFatma Hassouna, 25, a photographer and film-maker,was killed in an Israeli airstrike that hit her homein northern Gaza in April, just months before her wedding. Six members of her family, including her pregnant sister, were also killed.Hassouna, who graduated shortly before the war with a degree in multimedia, had spent 18 months documenting airstrikes, the endless displacement and the killing of 11 family members. Her work was published by the Guardian and other international outlets, and received much attention on social media.“If I die, I want a loud death,” she had written. “I don’t want to be just breaking news, or a number in a group, I want a death that the world will hear, an impact that will remain through time, and a timeless image that cannot be buried by time or place.”A film made with Hassouna was accepted for screening by the Cannes film festival the day before she was killed.The Israeli military said its attack had targeted a Hamas member involved in attacks on its soldiers and civilians.Hassan AslihView image in fullscreenHassan Aslih.Photograph: InstagramHassan Aslih, 37, was being treated for injuries from a previous Israeli strike whenhe was killed in a drone attack on the emergency departmentof Nasser hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza in May.Israel has accused the photographer, who had a vast following on social media, of taking part in the 7 October 2023 attack. Aslih documented the attack and followed fighters into Israel, taking photographs that were published worldwide. He denied Israel’s allegations.Hossam ShabatView image in fullscreenHossam Shabat.Photograph: HandoutHossam Shabat, 23, was killed in March, shortly after Israel definitively ended a two-month ceasefire with a wave of airstrikes. A correspondent for the Al Jazeera Mubasher channel,he died in an airstrike on his carin the ruined northern town of Beit Lahiya as he was conducting interviews. He was also a contributor to the US-based Drop Site News.Friends described an enthusiastic and brave reporter, who “touched people’s pain with his camera and his voice”. The Israeli military said it had “eliminated [a] terrorist” who had been a Hamas sniper, and cited documents soldiers had found in Gaza as evidence for the accusation.Hours after he was killed, Shabat’s teamposted a message on Xthat he had written to be published in the event of his death.“I documented the horrors in northern Gaza minute by minute … Each day was a battle for survival,” he wrote. “I fulfilled my duty as a journalist. I risked everything to report the truth, and now, I am finally at rest – something I haven’t known in the past 18 months.”Hamza al-DahdouhView image in fullscreenHamza al-Dahdouh.Photograph: Twitter/XHamza al-Dahdouh, 27, a journalist for Al Jazeera,was killed along with a freelance cameramanworking for Agence France-Presse in an Israeli drone strike on their car in southern Gaza in January 2024.The eldest son of the well-known Al Jazeera bureau chief in Gaza, Wael al-Dahdouh, his mother, brother, sister and nephew had been killed in an Israeli airstrike just weeks before. His father described his son as “kind, generous, ambitious”. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who was in Doha at the time, called the death an “unimaginable loss”.The Israeli military claimed Dahdouh had been targeted “as a terrorist operating an aircraft that posed a threat to IDF troops”, a reference to a small drone the reporter used to gather footage.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesJournalist safetynewsShareReuse this content"

May his memory be a revolution |  Emily GlickRead moreLevi was arrested over the killing but quickly released by a court after a ruling that the evidence he had fired at Hathaleen had “weakened”.Levi has denied he fired the shot that killed Hathaleen. However, the footage filmed by Hathaleen himself shows Levi draw his weapon and fire in Hathaleen’s direction. Hathaleen is then heard groaning and falling to the ground.Hathaleen was filming settlers operating an earth mover when he was shot. According to witnesses, a confrontation that was taking place between Levi and Palestinian residents became more heated when the digger attempted to approach a fenced-off grove belonging to a Palestinian family, with at least one stone thrown.The footage, filmed from some distance away, shows Levi waving a gun and scuffling with residents as they attempt to block the earth mover.Levi can then be seen taking several steps to his right before raising his gun, aiming it in Hathaleen’s direction, and firing. The footage sharply contradicts claims by Levi’s lawyer, Avichai Hajbi, that he had been “forced to fire his weapon into the air” because he felt his life was in danger.0:53Palestinian activist recorded moment he was killed by settler in West Bank – videoHathaleen’s footage is backed up by witness evidence provided to B’Tselem, including by his brother-in-law Alaa Hathaleen, who was present at the time of the killing and is seen in the footage remonstrating with Levi at close quarters and attempting to film the events himself with his phone.“The settler Yinon Levi arrived,” Alaa Hathaleen told B’Tselem. “The residents shouted at him, and he drew his gun. I tried to film him pulling out the gun, but he attacked me and grabbed my phone.“Suddenly, while we were trying to move people away and the excavator was already on the road leading to the settlement, Yinon Levi fired one shot, and then another shot.“I heard shouts: ‘Awdah! Awdah!’ I turned around and found my cousin Awdah lying in the public garden of Umm al-Khair’s community centre. He was bleeding heavily from the chest and mouth. It turned out he had been shot while filming the events, from about 40 meters away, behind a metal fence we had put up around the garden.”Levi was sanctioned by the UK in 2024, along with others, because he “used physical aggression, threatened families at gunpoint, and destroyed property as part of a targeted and calculated effort to displace Palestinian communities”.Levi’s treatment by the courts since the shooting is in line with a long history of lenient treatment by both the Israeli civilian and military courts of Israelis who kill Palestinians.Explore more on these topicsWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Seven people were killed in the attack, including theAl Jazeeracorrespondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and the camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa, according to the Qatar-based broadcaster.On Monday, the Guardian visited the site where the journalists were killed. Wadi Abu al-Saud, a Palestinian journalist who was near the tent when the Israeli strike occurred on Sunday, said the attack happened at 11.22pm, just after he had finished filming his latest news bulletin.“I entered the tent opposite theirs, raised my phone to make a call, and then the explosion occurred, Saud said. “A piece of shrapnel hit my phone. I looked back and saw people burning in flames. I tried to extinguish them. Anas and the others had died instantly from the strike.”1:22Al Jazeera's Anas al-Sharif among five journalists killed by Israel in Gaza – videoIn two videos of the aftermath of the strike, Saud can be seen carrying the bodies of those killed. “From now on, I will not continue the coverage,” he said. “I will return to my life as a citizen. The truth has died and the coverage has ended.”The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) admitted carrying out the attack, claiming Sharif was the leader of a Hamas cell responsible for rocket attacks against Israel – an allegation that Al Jazeera and Sharif had previously dismissed as baseless.It was the first time during the war that Israel’s military has swiftly claimed responsibility after a journalist was killed in a strike.Pro-Israel advocates on social media hailed the killing of Sharif and posted photos handed out by the IDF of photos the journalist took with the former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, taken before Hamas’s attack on 7 October.Sara Qudah, theMiddle East and north Africadirector at the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), said: “Israel’s pattern of labelling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom.”In July, Sharif told CPJ that he lived with the “feeling that I could be bombed and martyred at any moment”.Reporters Without Borders condemned the “acknowledged murder by the Israeli army” of Sharif inGazaand called on the international community to intervene.Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said: “We are gravely concerned by the repeated targeting of journalists in Gaza. Reporters covering conflicts are afforded protection under international humanitarian law and journalists must be able to report independently without fear, and Israel must ensure journalists can carry out their work safely.”The UN human rights office condemned the targeting of the journalists’ tent, saying it was “in grave breach of international humanitarian law”.Al Jazeera said the attack was “a desperate attempt to silence voices in anticipation of the occupation of Gaza” and called Sharif “one of Gaza’s bravest journalists”.People gathered at Sheikh Radwan cemetery in the heart of the Gaza Strip to mourn the journalists, whose bodies lay wrapped in white sheets at al-Shifa hospital before their burial. Friends, colleagues and relatives embraced and consoled one another.View image in fullscreenThe funeral procession of Anas al-Sharif, prominent Al Jazeera correspondent and other journalists killed in Israeli airstrike on Gaza.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe area where the attack took place was crowded with media workers on Monday, some speaking to cameras or mobile phones, others taking photos.Islam al-Za’anoun, a news correspondent for Palestine TV and several Arab channels who participated in the funeral, said Sunday’s attack was “a turning point in the world of journalism”.She said: “Despite all the threats he received and the Israeli media’s incitement against him, al-Sharif continued reporting. Now one question haunts me: Who will be next on the list? Will it be me?”Bilal Abu Khalifa, a presenter at Al Jazeera, said he had met Sharif four days ago. “He told me he was in danger,” Abu Khalifa said. “I asked him not to go out or appear publicly too often. He gave me a very simple answer: Bilal, I will not leave Gaza except to the sky! I will not leave Gaza even if I am killed. I know I am on the assassination list, but I will continue to expose the crimes of the Israeli army against my people and show the world, and everyone who stands by them, the truth.”In a final message, which Al Jazeera said had been written on 6 April and which was posted to Sharif’s X account after his death, the reporter said he had “lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification.”‘It was as if I had been poisoned when I left Gaza’: journalist Wael al-Dahdouh on family loss, survival and finding solidarityRead moreHe continued: “Allah may bear witness against those who stayed silent, those who accepted our killing, those who choked our breath, and whose hearts were unmoved by the scattered remains of our children and women, doing nothing to stop the massacre that our people have faced for more than a year and a half.”After the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, Israel barred international journalists from entering Gaza – one of the rare moments when international reporters have been denied access to an active war zone. Since then, the task of documenting the war has fallen heavily on Palestinian journalists, often at the cost of their lives – themselves caught in its devastation, displaced multiple times, their homes reduced to rubble, friends and relatives killed, and at times queueing for food at perilous distribution points.According to Gaza’s government media office, 238 journalists have been killed by Israel since the war started. CPJ said at least 186 journalists had been killed in the Gaza conflict. Israel denies deliberately targeting journalists.In a report released this year, the Watson School of International and Public Affairs’ costs of war project said more journalists had been killed in Gaza than in both world wars, the Vietnam war, the wars in Yugoslavia and the US war in Afghanistan combined.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesAl JazeeraJournalist safetyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The court gave authorities eight weeks to create the facilities and install CCTV monitoring to ensure no animals are released back on to the streets.The bench stressed the need for immediate action. “Round up all stray dogs from all localities … whether sterilised or unsterilised,” Justice JB Pardiwala declared. “Children must feel safe while cycling and playing. The elderly must feel safe on their walks.”Stray dog control has become a lightning rod civic issue inDelhiand other Indian cities. While some residents see the dogs as a menace, others consider them to be like family. Many of the dogs are fed daily by “community feeders” who provide food, water and veterinary care.Nishima Bhagat, who attended a candlelight march in the centre of the city on Monday night to protest against the court ruling, said: “We are walking in solidarity to show that there are people for the voiceless. They [the dogs] cannot speak for themselves. They cannot be put into the pounds. We cannot uproot them from the place where they live.”India bears the highest rabies burden globally. Each year about 5,700 people die from rabies, according to government figures, and the World Health Organization believes the toll to be as high as 20,000 deaths.The last dog census, in 2012, put Delhi’s stray population at 60,000 and the figure now is estimated to be closer to 1 million. Dog packs roam parks, construction sites and residential lanes. Attacks on children and elderly people often make news headlines.Between January and June this year, Delhi reported 35,198 animal bite incidents and 49 rabies cases, municipal data shows.Pardiwala dismissed India’s animal birth control (ABC) rules, which mandate that sterilised dogs be returned to their territories, as “absurd” and ineffective. “All these so-called animal lovers, will they bring back the children who have lost their lives?” he said, urging civic authorities to act decisively rather than debate policy.The ruling said there could be no exceptions and that anyone resisting the removals would face charges.Animal protection groups called the order “impractical and inhumane”. Bharati Ramachandran, the chief executive of the Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations, urged large-scale sterilisation, vaccination, and public awareness campaigns.Mini Aravindan, a senior official at Peta India, said: “It’s infeasible to build and staff enough shelters for hundreds of thousands of dogs” and the cost would be huge.Explore more on these topicsDelhiIndiaAnimalsSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Every incident is unacceptable,” she said.Rachelle McCarthy, a charge nurse in the east Midlands, said that in her A&E department “even patients you would expect to be placid are becoming irate because of just how long they have to wait”.Once she was punched “square in the face” by “a drunk, 6ft 2in bloke”, she said.In another incident a patient in the waiting room of the A&E where the senior sister Sarah Tappy works in east London punched her in the head, knocking her unconscious. “The violence is awful. And it’s just constant. Nurses. Doctors. Receptionists. None of us feel safe,” she said.A senior A&E nurse in England’s south-west said she had seenviolence against staffin her wards many times, including a patient “pinning a nurse up against a wall” and another colleague being punched by a patient “in the groin and stomach”.The number of attacks on A&E staff at Southmead hospital in Bristol rose from 83 in 2019 to 152 last year. They doubled at Manchester Royal Infirmary from 39 to 79 over the same time period, and increased from 13 to 89 at Maidstone hospital in Kent,NHSfigures given to the RCN showed.Daniel Elkeles, the chief executive of hospitals group NHS Providers, said: “These findings are absolutely shocking.“NHS staff need a safe and respectful environment to look after patients, free from any threat of violence or intimidation, be they in hospital, mental health, community or ambulance settings.“Delays for treatment are frustrating for patients and staff. Every effort is being made to keep these to a minimum.”The union demanded immediate government action to curb the “rising tide of violence”. It wants a reduction in the long waits for patients in A&E, an end to overcrowded hospitals having to use “corridor care” and a solution to the shortages of nurses that are common across the NHS.A separate RCN analysis shows the number of patients who had to wait more than 12 hours in A&E soared twentyfold between 2019 and 2014.Growing numbers of hospitals have hired more security staff, issued clinical staff with stab vests and installed more closed-circuit television.Rebecca Smith, the director of system and social partnership at the NHS Confederation, said the near doubling in attacks exposed by the figures was “deeply worrying”.“No one should have to face violence at work – it is totally unacceptable. These kinds of incidents not only have a huge impact on staff health and wellbeing but also retention of staff as well as NHS services and patient experience.”The RCN sent an freedom of information request to the 129 NHS trusts in England that have at least one emergency department. Of those 89 (69%) replied. However, the true figures will be higher as the union only asked for data relating to the biggest A&E the trust runs.Their figures show a relentless rise in incidents over the six years, from 2,122 in 2019 to 2,297 in 2020, then 2,851 in 2021, 3,120 in 2022, 3,405 in 2023 and finally 4,054 in 2024.NHS Protect issued annual figures for violence, harassment and abuse of NHS staff until it was disbanded in 2016.The most recentNHS staff survey, published in March, found that one in seven workers (14.4%) had suffered physical violence from patients, their relatives or other members of the public in the previous year.Duncan Burton, chief nursing officer for England, said it was “totally unacceptable that NHS staff are facing acts of physical violence from patients and the public while at work”.He added: “NHS staff do an incredible job every day to care for others – and they have the right to come to work without fear of being harmed. We would encourage staff to report all incidents to their employer and for employers to inform the police where appropriate so that perpetrators can be brought to justice.”The health secretary,Wes Streeting, said: “I am appalled by these findings. Nurses dedicate their lives to helping others and deserve to go about their jobs free from violence or intimidation. Anyone who violates this core principle will feel the full force of the law.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthNursingEnglandWes StreetingnewsShareReuse this content"

Disrupting Israel’s largest weapons manufacturer, Elbit Systems, by trespassing on their sites in Britain is not terrorism. It is the Israeli Defense Forces and all those who arm and enable their war crimes who are the terrorists.”JTAC, agovernment body based within MI5, produced a secret report on 7 March which was disclosed in the high court.While recommending banning Palestine Action, JTAC said the group “primarily uses direct action tactics”, which typically resulted in minor damage to property. “Common tactics include graffiti, petty vandalism, occupation and lock-ons,” it added.Defend Our Juries, which has organised multiple demonstrations, including Saturday’s, in support of Palestine Action, also highlighted Whitehall officials’ description – again in documents revealed in court – of a ban as “relatively novel” as “there was no known precedent of an organisation being proscribed on the basis that it was concerned in terrorism mainly due to its use or threat of action involving serious damage to property”.ADefend Our Juriesspokesperson said: “It is despicable that under political pressure, Yvette Cooper is now actively misleading the British public about the nature of Palestine Action, knowing that if people come to their defence to counter her disinformation, she can have them jailed for 14 years [because they could be deemed to supporting a proscribed group].”The group said many hundreds of people had already committed to the next protest, which is likely to take place in early September and to be on an even larger scale.Uncertainty remains over the status of charges and prosecutions. Tom Franklin, chief executive of the Magistrates’ Association, said: “Based on the information that we currently have, and the statement put out by the MetropolitanPoliceyesterday [Sunday], it could take days and possibly weeks for decisions to be made on whether or not to charge any of those arrested over the weekend. Many of these cases may also be heard in the crown courts, rather than magistrates courts.”Magistrates courts hear less serious cases, although some charges under section 13 of the Terrorism Act are “either way”, meaning the defendant can choose whether to be tried before magistrates or a jury in the crown court.The Defend Our Juries spokesperson said: “Personally I would go to the crown court because I know where the British public is, both on the genocide in Gaza and secondly on the British government’s support for it, and thirdly on people not being allowed to express their opinions.”However, they added that they expected most charges to be laid under section 13, which are all heard in the magistrates courts, as the criminal justice system would not be able to cope with so many jury trials.Explore more on these topicsProtestPalestinian territoriesYvette CooperPoliceIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

On Monday they could borrow a maximum of £556,500, assuming a standard mortgage and a 25-year term, but on Tuesday this will rise to £687,500. That is 24% more than before.Santander gave other examples where the extra amounts people would be able to borrow were smaller – 12% in one case, and 4% in another.In the last few months, many banks and building societies have announced changes to their rules. Some have loosened their “stress test” rules, which check that repayments will remain affordable even if mortgage rates go up, while others have increased their loan-to-income lending caps above the traditional 4.5:1 ratio.In March, the Financial Conduct Authority said the tests that some lenders were doing “may be unduly restricting accessto otherwise affordable mortgages”. In July,the Bank of England issued guidelinesthat meant lenders could offer more high loan-to-income mortgages.Santander’s changes are a result of it updating its loan-to-income rules. The extra that people will be able to borrow will depend on how much they earn and the size of their deposit, or how much equity they have.The new rules mean applicants earning a total of £100,000 or more can now access 5.5 times their income on all loan-to-value (LTV) levels up to 90%. In other words, they will need a minimum deposit or equity of 10% of the home’s value to be eligible for those terms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The changes would “hopefully help more would-be buyers access the money they need to buy the home of their dreams,” he said.Explore more on these topicsMortgagesBanco SantanderBanks and building societiesBorrowing & debtPropertyBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

It quoted witnesses who claimed to have seen the man stumbling in a “paralytic” state.At 2.30am he reportedly removed all his clothes and walked into the reception area, before moving to the gym and spa.The man had been due to fly passengers to Gatwick from Cape Verde last Wednesday. After the incident in the hotel, he was grounded by the airline and a replacement pilot was called up.An easyJet source told the Sun: “Anyone who saw the pilot cavorting naked in the early hours on the day before a flight would not dream of getting on a plane with him at the controls.”An easyJet spokesperson said: “As soon as we were made aware, the pilot was immediately stood down from duty, in line with our procedures, pending an investigation. The safety of our passengers and crew is easyJet’s highest priority.”EasyJet’s flights from Gatwick to Cape Verde are its longest from England, at 2,332 nautical miles, with the journey taking about six hours.Explore more on these topicsUK newsCape VerdeeasyJetAirline industryAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

TheWall Street Journalreported on Sunday that former White House adviser and rightwing provocateur Steve Bannon had advocated for Antoni’s nomination.In a statement on X, labor secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said Antoni would “provide the American people with fair and accurate economic data they can rely on”.The president’s shock firing of McEntarfer alarmed economists and statisticians – as well as some senior Republican lawmakers –who feared the move would undermine the credibility of the agency’s economic data – long seen as a gold standard.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

The area has recently endured extreme drought conditions, and has “volatile” fuel loads, officials said.The blaze, sparked by lightning on 2 August, had burned through more than 130,000 acres (52,000 hectares) by Monday morning and was just 7% contained. Low humidity and gusty winds were expected to return to the area, which combined with dry fuels, can cause extreme fire behavior, such as winds that carry embers over long distances and cause additional fires, officials aid.Colorado prison evacuated as wildfire becomes one of largest in state historyRead moreAnother major blaze in the region, the Elk fire, is burning to the east of the Lee fire, and has scorched more than 14,000 acres and is 30% contained. Officials have said containment has continued to increase and that crews are working to reinforce existing fire lines.On Monday, the Colorado governor, Jared Polis, declared a disaster emergency to support response efforts for the Oak fire, which is burning in Pagosa Springs, Archuleta county.Evacuations are in place for mountain communities across Garfield and Rio Blanco counties. On Saturday, the Rifle correctional center was evacuated “out of an abundance of caution”, the Colorado department of corrections said.Smoke caused by the fires has prompted air quality warnings.Meanwhile, in southernCalifornia, crews reached more than 90% containment on the Canyon fire that forced evacuations and destroyed seven structures after breaking out Thursday near the Los Angeles county andVenturacounty line. Three firefighters have been injured in that blaze, including a battalion chief who was seriously hurt when his pickup truck rolled over in steep terrain.The Gifford fire, California’s largest blaze so far this year, has scorched nearly 120,000 acres of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties since erupting on 1 August. It was 33% contained on Monday.With months left before the highest fire risks subside, it has already been an explosive year for fire across North America. Nearlyall available firefighting resourcesare deployed in the US, as 36 large fires actively burn across the country.In Canada,hundreds of wildfirescontinue to burn out of control and the country is seeing its second-worst fire season on record. More than 18m (7.3m hectares) has been scorched – nearly 78% more than the five-year average, according to data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC).“This is our new reality … the warmer it gets, the more fires we see,” Mike Flannigan, the BC research chair for predictive services, emergency management and fire science at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, told the Guardian.The climate crisis has intensified conditions that fuel fires, setting the stage for easier ignitions, rapid growth, and hotter, catastrophic burns that are more challenging to contain.This article was amended on 11 August 2025 to correct the spelling of a town affected by the Lee fire.

However, the quid pro quo arrangement, first reported by the Financial Times, is potentially unconstitutional.The arrangement will lead to Nvidia giving 15% of its revenue from Chinese sales of its H20 chips, and AMD giving 15% of revenue from Chinese sales of its MI308 chips, according to reports citing US officials.Trump permits Nvidia to sell advanced chips in China, CEO saysRead moreThe US government has for several years sought to limit supplies of technology to China that could be used in ways that threaten US national security, especially chips that can power artificial intelligence development and weapons.Nvidia’s chips are amajor driver of the AI boom, highly sought-after by both China and the US. Beijing has repeatedly criticised the chip restrictions and accused the US of using tech and trade to “maliciously contain and suppress China”.The H20 and MI308 chips were banned from sale to China in April, despite the lower-powered H20 being designed specifically to abide by restrictions introduced by the Biden administration.However, last month Trump rolled back the bans, and last week the commerce department reportedly started issuing export licences for the H20 – a move that analysts linked to China’s easing of rare earth export restrictions, and to the revenue-sharing agreement revealed on Sunday.In an apparent lobbying effort to address the restrictions, Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, had made visits to Trump andofficials in Beijingin recent months, meeting the US president as recently as Wednesday.Trump has praised Huang and Nvidia, which in July became the first company to haveits market value pass $4tn (£2.97tn), even as it navigated the US-China trade war and other industry turbulence, including Trump’s threatened 100% tariff on foreign semiconductors.In a statement after the Financial Times report, Nvidia said: “We follow rules the US government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. While we haven’t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.”AMD has not commented on the deal.Nvidia’s statement echoed comments by the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, last month, that it was in the US’s interests to have China using American technology, and that the H20 was Nvidia’s “fourth-best chip”. The deal has alarmed analysts, however.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It made revenues of $13.4m in 2024, down from $15.7m the previous year.View image in fullscreenA Fabergé egg from the Kremlin Museum collection in Moscow, Russia.Photograph: Laski Diffusion/Getty ImagesSean Gilbertson, the chief executive of Gemfields, described the deal as “the end of an era”.He said: “Fabergé has played a key role in raising the profile of the coloured gemstones mined by Gemfields and we will certainly miss its marketing leverage and star power.”Mosunov, a venture capitalist and startup investor, said it was a “great honour … to become the custodian of such an outstanding and globally recognised brand”. Mosunov is a Russian national based in the UK.“Fabergé’s unique heritage, with ties to Russia, England, France and the USA, opens significant opportunities for further strengthening its position in the global luxury market and expanding its international presence,” he said.Fabergé is best known for the ornate eggs it made for the Russian royal family before the 1917 revolution. The jeweller began making Imperial Easter eggs when tsar Alexander III first commissioned them as a present for his wife, tsarina Maria Feodorovna, in 1885. There are 50 Imperial Easter eggs in collections around the world.During the Russian revolution, the Bolsheviks seized the Fabergé workshops and closed down production. The family fled across Europe to Germany, Finland and Switzerland.The brand was revived under various iterations over the course of the 20th century, and was sold for $180m in 1984. Three years later it acquired the Elizabeth Arden brand for $700m. In 1989, the consumer goods group Unilever then bought Fabergé for $1.55bn. The brand was relaunched by the Fabergé family in 2009.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In June the company told investors that the opening of a new mine in Mozambique had been delayed because of problems around illegal mining and work permits.Explore more on these topicsMergers and acquisitionsLuxury goods sectorWomen's jewelleryMen's jewelleryMiningnewsShareReuse this content"

According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, international visitors to one of the world’s largest tourist destinationsdropped13% in June.“A lot of departments are having a lot of layoffs,” said ​​Norma Torres, a housekeeper for eight years at Mandalay Bay and a member of the Culinary Union, who has worked in the hospitality industry since she was 18 years old. “In the housekeeping department, the people on call are barely called into work.”Canada is Nevada’slargestinternational market. Flair Airlines, a Canadian airline, reported a55%drop in passengers compared to last year. Air Canada reported a13.2%drop in passengers from May to June this year to Las Vegas, and one third lower compared to last year.Trump administration officials havereportedlypushed for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents to arrest 3,000 people a day as part of their anti-immigrationagenda. They have subsequentlydeniedthat those quotas exist. But they have continued to revoke immigration statuses,delayed action for childhood arrivals,and other humanitarian immigration programs.“If you tell the rest of the world you’re not welcome, they are going to listen. Our members are telling us that they’re quite nervous, and that’s why they’re calling it a Trump slump,” said Ted Pappageorge, secretary treasurer of Culinary Workers Union Local 226.But the Ice raids, trade wars with trading partners and fears that rising tariffs will hit the finances of potential visitors are all having an impact on Sin City tourism.“You have Canadians that have said, ‘We’re going to go elsewhere.’ Some of our best customers are Mexican tourists. But the biggest one is southern California and visitation is down because they’re nervous about raids, the tariffs, the economy riled up,” added Pappageorge. “The way these kind of chaotic immigration policies have been handled have a direct impact, we think, on what’s happening with this slowdown in Las Vegas and our members are quite concerned.”The union noted its members come from 178 different countries and speak 40 different languages. The union represents 60,000 workers in Las Vegas and Reno, and 45% of its members are immigrants.Nearly a quarter (24%) of Nevada’s workforce are immigrants, and an even higher share of Nevada’s leisure and hospitality industry are immigrants. Immigrants contribute an estimated $20.2bn to Nevada’s economy annually.Norma Torres, who was born in Mexico, currently has Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) immigration status, a policy enacted in 2012 for immigrant individuals brought to the US as children.View image in fullscreenNorma Torres, housekeeper at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas.Photograph: Courtesy of Culinary UnionTorres explained she is worried about how the Trump administration will impact her immigration status.“Before I had a Daca, I was living in fear. Since I’ve had DACA, I’ve been living free, I’ve been working, I’ve been having the best life with my daughters, but now with this administration that we have going on with Daca and TPS, they are in danger and again I’m living in fear,” said Torres. “I can be driving on the street, they can pull me over. I can be separated from my daughters, they are US citizens who were born here and just thinking about that makes me afraid. For me and my family, we live in fear now.”Nery Martinez, a bartender at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas and Culinary Workers Union Local 226 member for 10 years, has been in the US for decades under temporary protected status from El Salvador and is worried about the push from the Trump administration to revoke TPS for thousands of immigrants from El Salvador and other countries.“That would be devastating, not only for me but for thousands of families,” said Martinez. “After 25 years in this place, what would I do if they separate me from my children, from my wife, from my life I had built from scratch? Those things hurt not just me and people like me, but also hurt citizen children, the community and the economy we help sustain.”View image in fullscreenNery Martinez, bartender at Caesar’s Palace.Photograph: Courtesy of Culinary UnionHe said he loves working in Las Vegas, working alongside others from all around the world and interacting with tourists from abroad and throughout the US, but emphasized he now worries about what is going to happen to his immigration status.“We are working people with families who love this country. We don’t want privilege, just that we are allowed to stay here legally as we have done for decades. Our families are American, I also feel part of this nation. Taking away TPS (temporary protected status) would be tearing away my life. I can’t have a nice night, go to bed, wake up the next day, because every night I have those thoughts about what’s going to happen.”Ted Pappageorgenotedthat for 20 years the culinary union has secured in their contracts that any worker who has their immigration status removed or expired is able to maintain their job, seniority, and pay until they get their status resolved, a support mechanism he argues should be legally provided to all workers.“The idea that you’re bringing in Marines and arresting dishwashers or landscapers, people that actually contribute to society, pay taxes, that go to our churches, their kids go to our schools, they’re neighbors, is just crazy. This is just chaos what’s going on here,” concluded Pappageorge. “There needs to be a complete 180 course correction on this damage being done to the travel, tourism, and hospitality industry, that’s ground zero here in Las Vegas.”The Nevada governor’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsLas VegasUS economyUS immigrationDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

There does not appear to be any change to electricity exports from France to the UK.The Gravelines plant draws water used in its cooling systems from a canal connected to the North Sea, which is home to several native species of jellyfish often seen around the shoreline in the summer when the waters are warmer.Jellyfish have a long history of derailing the normal operations of coastal power plants, which tap the ocean for the vast amounts of cool water needed to keep temperatures in check.The repeated problems caused by unexpected jellyfish numbers prompted scientists at the University of Bristol to develop an “early warning tool” to predict the sudden, en masse appearance of jellyfish swarms that might disrupt coastal power plants.The Torness nuclear plant in Scotland, which is also owned by EDF, was forced to shut for a week in 2021 after jellyfish clogged the seaweed filters on its water intake pipes, a decade after jellyfish shut the plant for a week in 2011.Jellyfish swarms have alsoclosed nuclear and coal power plants in Sweden, the US, Japan, and even caused a major blackout in the Philippines in 1999 that some mistakenly feared was linked to the Y2K bug or a government coup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There isn’t anybody who has been watching English football for any period of time who hasn’t made the mistake of taking too seriously a conclusion drawn in the midst of the traditional curtain-raiser, giddy on the sight of Wembley in its pomp and the return of competitive club football from the summer wilderness.Any analysis has to be tempered. Teams are always works in progress, evolving and developing, but that is never truer than in early August with new signings adapting to their teammates and surroundings, and others shaking the summer from their legs. Things will change. But after Liverpool’s 2-2 draw with Crystal Palaceand subsequent defeat on penaltiesin the Community Shield, it can be said with a degree of certainty that their new signings have gelled better at the front of the pitch than the back.Premier League 2025-26 preview No 12: LiverpoolRead moreHugo Ekitiké, signed from Eintracht Frankfurt, and Florian Wirtz, signed from Bayer Leverkusen, had hugely encouraging debuts. Ekitiké and the attacking right-back Jeremie Frimpong, another from Leverkusen, both scored. ButLiverpoolwere shockingly, startlingly open at times, as they have been throughout pre-season – and it cost them the game.They are learning a new system, the 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 hybrid of last season yielding to a 4-2-3-1. It’s not a huge shift but Wirtz, as the most advanced of the triangle of central players between the centre-backs and the centre-forward, is very much a forward, whereas Dominik Szoboszlai, who tended to be the most advanced of the central midfield triangle last season, is an attacking midfielder. It’s not that Wirtz does not perform his defensive duties – he does, and is notably assiduous in doing so, a highly effective presser of the ball – it’s that he does so in slightly different positions.The expectation is that the midfield two in most games going forward, at least when Liverpool are not going to monopolise possession, will be Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister. Gravenberch was unavailable for the Community Shield after becoming a father on Saturday night, while Mac Allister is still regaining fitness and was restricted to the final 20 minutes. That led to Szoboszlai occupying a deeper role than usual alongside Curtis Jones, who made a convincing case for occupying the role more frequently with a controlled performance in which he completed all 53 of the passes he attempted. It was after he and Ekitiké were withdrawn that Palace began to mount concerted pressure.Coming to terms with an unfamiliar system without the two key cogs at the back of midfield, the area that was always likely to come under pressure with the change of formation, was far from ideal for Liverpool. They had looked entirely comfortable for the first 15 minutes but then a simple straight through-ball opened them up, Jean-Philippe Mateta played onside by at least one and possibly both full-backs as Virgil Van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté stepped up in the centre. Although Alisson made the initial save, Liverpool were still resetting as the ball was returned to the middle, leading to Van Dijk’s clumsy lunge on Mateta and the penalty that brought the first equaliser.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That was what led to the second equaliser: Van Dijk being drawn forward, leaving the gap into which Ismaïla Sarr burst to score. Clearly Gravenberch’s absence made a difference but nobody should think that his return will immediately solve the problems. The new shape means a different approach, with Liverpool adopting an aggressive man-to-man press that left space behind the defensive line. Sarr caused problems all game, repeatedly dragging Milos Kerkez, the fourth of the new signings in the starting lineup, infield, which meant Cody Gakpo had to do a lot of work tracking Palace’s right wing-back, Daniel Muñoz.None of this is unsolvable, but it does mean that Liverpool may be more defensively vulnerable, at least in the early part of the campaign, than they were in winning the league last season. Ekitiké had an excellent game, his movement and his touch, his awareness, all excellent. Wirtz impressed as well with his energy and invention; the penultimate pass he played in the buildup to the first goal demonstrating his capacity to see opportunities others would not, crafting a service to Ekitiké that took three Palace players out of the game.But for any side making as many changes as Liverpool have this summer, with four big new signings and a fifth perhaps to arrive inAlexander Isak, there will be a degree of uncertainty, a period of bedding in. The possibilities are exciting but, as Slot reshapes the squad to his own specifications, some teething troubles are only to be expected.On this day…View image in fullscreenPSG came into being 55 years ago today.Photograph: Every Second Media/AlamyParis Saint-Germainare by some margin the youngest of Europe’s giants, having come into being on 11 August 1970, a day after the birth of the former Manchester United and Ireland midfielder Roy Keane. The French capital had no major club which, as European competition became established through the 1960s, came to seem increasingly bizarre. So, in 1969, the French Football Federation, the mayor of Paris, the editor of French sports newspaper l’Équipe and Guy Crescent, who ran the Calberson truck company and was prepared to provide financing, got together to decide the best way of setting up a team for Paris. A referendum confirmed the scheme had overwhelming popularity, voting for the name Paris FC, and, in February 1970, a telethon attracted 10,000 people to sign up as members, each paying 20 francs.But Paris FC had no stadium, players, coach or licence, so a merger was arranged with the second-flight side Stade Saint-Germain, creating Paris Saint-Germain (Paris FC broke away in 1972 and, after promotion this past May, will compete again in the French top flight this season). After the fashion designer Daniel Hechter took over in 1973, redesigning the kit and providing investment, the club gained promotion to the top-flight, moving in to the Parc des Princes in 1974 as Paris FC were relegated.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

Instead of allowing her emotions to consume her, though, they inspired one of the most impressive performances of her career as she pushed Aryna Sabalenka, the best player in the world, to the edge of her limits in an epic three hour and nine minute scuffle before narrowly falling 7-6 (3), 4-6, 7-6 (5) in the third round of the Cincinnati Open.Recently, Raducanu has performed well against lower-ranked opponents but the gulf between her and the top players had been undeniable. Here, the 22-year-old proved to herself that she has enough quality to beat the best in the world.‘People see themselves in me’: Frances Tiafoe on being a tennis trailbazer in a mainly white sportRead moreHaving struggled with her serve throughout this year, including throughout the first set, this performance particularly underlined the progress she has made on her first serve. From a set down, Raducanu dragged herself back into the match with some of her best serving performances of the year as she breezed through her games and continually put pressure on Sabalenka. In the decisive moments, however, Raducanu did not always maintain her confidence behind it.During the exchanges, Raducanu chose her moments to attack with her forehand brilliantly, she absorbed Sabalenka’s pace effectively, defending well and mixing in her much improved backhand slice. Along with the effectiveness of her game, Raducanu’s resilience was admirable. This performance was a testament to her development as both a player and competitor.For her part, Sabalenka’s level was far from her best and her struggles were reflected in 72 unforced errors. But she has evolved into such an incredible, reliable competitor. Even when she struggled with her form, her error count continued to pile up and she was plainly being outplayed by Raducanu, she maintained her composure and continued to search for a way through.With the Belarusian men’s doubles legend Max Mirnyi a new addition to her team, Sabalenka showed her continued development by repeatedly approaching the net in decisive points deep in the final set. Sabalenka has become such a consistent player and she has learned how to find a path to victory regardless of her struggles. She has now, incredibly, won 16 tie-breaks in a row. Raducanu is not the first player to be outhustled by the No 1 in a tight match, and nor will she be the last.The players walked out onto Centre Court just before 1pm in stifling 32C heat and humid conditions that have presented a significant physical challenge. Although Raducanu was sharp at the beginning of a turbulent first set, winning the first nine points of the match, that hopeful early spell did not last. As the momentum wildly swung back and forth, they ended the set in a tie-break. While Sabalenka elevated her level under pressure, Raducanu lost all confidence in her second serve. After double faulting at 1-3, her shoulders slumped and she quickly found herself down a set.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka held her nerve in a third-set tie-break to defeat Emma Raducanu.Photograph: Daniel Kopatsch/Getty ImagesAlthough Raducanu was understandably deflated, her resilience was impressive. She bounced back immediately, opening the second set by finding brilliant rhythm on the serve. She finished the set having landed 82% of first serves while winning 75% behind it, which she complimented with an excellent return game at 3-3 against an increasingly erratic Sabalenka.Both players opted to take a bathroom break and briefly escape the humidity before the final set, but it was Raducanu who returned first. Her subsequent discussion withFrancisco Roig, her new coach, touched on many facets of her game, but he constantly repeated one particular message when giving his perspective on the match: “You’re better than her.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After 13 deuces and four break points across a game that lasted over 20 minutes, Raducanu found the strength to drag herself through the game with an unreturned serve and then she composed herself to force a final set tie-break.Even though she was far from her best and countless opportunities had passed her by, Sabalenka still found a way to produce her best tennis in the most important moments. She nervelessly closed an excellent, tight tussle with an ace.In the aftermath of her tight two-set match againstSabalenka at Wimbledon, the challenge for Raducanu was to maintain that momentum. She has consolidated it brilliantly with her performances across the North American hard court season, both playing and winning consistently, her confidence growing with each tournament.Once the pain from this excruciating defeat abates, this will only make her a better player. Four years on from thefortnight in New Yorkthat changed her life, Raducanu will head to the US Open in better form than she has been since then.Explore more on these topicsTennisEmma RaducanunewsShareReuse this content"

Track workers peeled away the roof to remove the 53-year-old, and an ambulance took him to a local hospital, after which he died,the Winston-Salem Journal reported.“We are saddened by the passing of Robbie Brewer after he was transported to an area medical facility following an on-track medical incident,” track officials said on Sunday in a statement. “Robbie was a talented and passionate racer, and highly respected competitor among his peers. Our thoughts and prayers are with Robbie’s family and friends at this time.”Details of the medical emergency weren’t released.Brewer was competing in a 20-lap Sportsman Series race at Bowman Gray, where thousands of racing fans turn out weekly on Saturday nights in the spring and summer for races across four divisions. Bowman Gray also was the venue for this year’s preseason Nascar Cup Series exhibition event in early February.Brewer’s first career start at the oval came in 1990, and he made nearly 260 starts in the Sportsman Division, winning the points championship in 2011.Fellow Bowman Gray driver Brad Lewis, whose race shop is near where Brewer lived, said Brewer “was like a big brother to me even though we were not that far apart in age.”“He was a wheelman through and through,” Lewis said. “I’m not only going to honor him the rest of the season but for as long as we race out there.

The governing body said it was “perfectly normal”.The sportwas rocked in Marchby the discovery of illegally altered suits on the Norwegian team at the world championships. The International Ski Federation investigated officials and athletes over those changes that could help the wearer to soar through the air for longer thanks to the suit’s larger surface area.On Monday, the Olympic gold medal­lists Marius Lindvik and Johann André Forfang, and three staff members on the Norway men’s team, were charged with ethics violation as part of an investigation into “equipment manipulation”. Lindvik’s gold medal in the men’s normal hill event at the Trondheim world championships, and Norway’s bronze in the men’s team event on the large hill, are at risk.On Saturday at the first event of the 2025-26 season – a summer Grand Prix event on an artificial surface in France – six male ski ­jumpers were also disqualified because of suit issues such as waist size and three more were “not permitted to start”. Another jumper from Japan was blocked from competing as the Grand Prix continued on Sunday.The federation confirmed it is treating the spate of ­disqualifications as the natural result of tightening up the rules after the Norwegian suit scandal. The FIS race director, Sandro Pertile, said he did not think anyone was trying to cheat and that fewer ­disqualifications would occur as teams became accus­tomed to the rules. Making specia­lised ski jumping equipment is “a fairly complicated matter”, he said.View image in fullscreenNika Prevc prepares to jump at the Courchevel event.Photograph: Vianney Thibaut/NordicFocus/Getty Images“It’s perfectly normal for teams to need some time to adapt to the new situation after such comprehensive changes to the equipment regulations. Some cope with it straight away, others find it difficult at first,” Pertile said. “It’s also important to highlight that these disqualifications are clearly a result of technical inadequacies – there’s no sign whatsoever of ill intent from the teams.”The FIS indicated that a further nine men and five women did not ­compete after a “technical approval” process, though it was not clear if all of those cases involved their suits. Five of those 14 were on the USA team, which did not respond immediately to a request for comment.Among those disqualified on Satur­day was Norway’s Kristoffer Eriksen Sundal, who had previously beenprovisionally suspended this yearafter the world championships.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The teenager on a team of 20-something Olympic gymnasts, doing her best to absorb what she could from Simone Biles, Sunisa Lee, Jade Carey and Jordan Chiles.The one thing that stood out, even more than the sometimes otherworldly gymnastics, is the way her fellow gold-medal-winning teammates went about their business.“They looked so confident,” Rivera said. “They’re like, ‘I’m going to go out and I’m going to hit.’ It gave me that confidence as well.”Simone Biles unsure of competing at 2028 LA Olympics: ‘My body is aging’Read moreIt looks like that confidence has paid off. The now 17-year-old who says she’s paying no attention to the idea that she’s the leader of the women’s program in the early stages of the run-up to the 2028 Olympics certainly looks the part.Buoyed by a polished steadiness – and a beam routine that finally looked the way it does back home at her home gym in Texas – Rivera captured her first national title Sunday night at the US Championships. Her two-day total of 112.000 was good enough to fend off a challenge from Leanne Wong and put her in excellent position to lead the four-woman American delegation at the world championships in Indonesia, in October.Rivera, by far the youngest member of the five-woman team that finished atop the podium in Paris a year ago, bounced back from a shaky performance at the US Classic last month with the kind of measured, refined gymnastics that she attributed to simply “letting go” of whatever pressure she might feel as the lone Olympic gold medalist in a remarkably young field.“No matter how rough the competition is, I still can get back into the gym and work hard because all those months previously that I’ve been working hard, I know it’s going to show up eventually,” she said. “So it kind of just took a weight off my shoulders.”Rivera, at the very least, locked up a spot in the world championship selection camp next month. So did Wong, a four-time world championship medalist, budding entrepreneur and pre-med student who shows no signs of slowing down despite years of competing collegiately and at the elite level simultaneously.Asked how she juggles it all, the 21-year-old said she lives by the motto “there’s time for everything.”Joscelyn Roberson, an Olympic alternate last summer, shook off an ankle injury suffered at the end of her floor routine to finish third as the three most internationally experienced athletes in the field looked ready to lead after spending most of the last Olympic quad learning from Biles and company.“You go from, ‘Oh you’re so young, you’re so young,’ to, ‘Oh, you are the older kid,’” the 19-year-old Roberson said. “People say, ‘How are you feeling?’ Like, I honestly don’t feel that different.”Two summers ago, Roberson was Biles’ sidekick. Now she’s among the leaders of the next wave.“I felt like more responsible to let the little, smaller, less experienced kids know it’s not the end of the day if you have a bad day or if you had one fall,” Roberson said. “I want to help them grow instead of think ‘I have to be perfect.’”Roberson appeared ready to make it a three-woman race for first until she turned an ankle on the final tumbling pass of her floor routine. The rising sophomore at Arkansas gingerly continued on anyway. She gritted her way through her vault dismount, though the five-tenths (0.5) deduction for using an additional pad for her protection took her out of contention for the all-around.Still, the victory hardly came easily for Rivera. She was pushed through four rotations by Wong, who started on Sunday with a stuck Cheng vault and didn’t relent over the course of two hours.Rivera responded each time – she posted the top scores on three of the four events – but it wasn’t until she walked off the podium following her floor routine with victory in hand that she could relax.“Everything fell into place,” Rivera said. “I tried not to get too overwhelmed because nerves obviously can be there, especially when you know you’re in a spot to win a national title, but I just took all pressure off myself.”Skye Blakely, who was injured at the Olympic Trials in both 2021 and 2024, was sublime on both uneven bars and balance beam to put herself in consideration to make the world team.Explore more on these topicsGymnasticsLA Olympic Games 2028US sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Especially for the not insignificant number of clubs flogging shirts for £85+ a pop. As sport and fashion become ever more intertwined – Jack Grealish as an ambassador for Gucci; SonHeung-min for Burberry; Kalvin Phillips inthose massive Loewe boots– mainstream football’s interest with clothes has moved on from justDavid Beckham in a sarong. It is a state of affairs thatformer catwalk modelPep Guardiola no doubt appreciates.And, after a couple of years of subpar kit designs – running the gamut from insipid to truly horrifying – the 2025-26 Premier League season has upped its sartorial game. All-black away strips and turquoise touches have proved popular; while manufacturers still insist on “taking inspiration” from home stadium architecture and surroundings. (The success of this varies immensely; but Everton, Leeds, and Burnley have all nailed it this time around.) No brand has let the side(s) down, but the Adidas designers have done especially well with a series of understated new strips, all based on their“Total 90” template. The smaller labels have also impressed. And it is pleasing to see the three returnees dressed up for the occasion.2025-26is due to be the final seasonthat betting companies are allowed to serve as front-of-shirt sponsors, but judging by the number still present they will have to be dragged from the pitch kicking and screaming. Here are all the looks – taking in sand, sky, and sea – to soon emerge from the tunnel.ArsenalView image in fullscreenArsenal go gothic.Photograph: Adidas/Arsenal FCThe Gunners launched their new home strip on a heavily vignetted, blood-redlanding page, complete with anatomical heart beating on the screen; an incongruously dark vibe until you consider that Mikel Arteta does indeed havesomething of the nightabout him. A subtle repeating motif on the shirt is a similarly eldritch, gothicA(a nod to the typeface used for the club’s 1949-50 “Victoria Concordia Crescit”crest), offset by a crisp white collar and sleeve. Said sleeve is still urging us toVisit Rwanda.Theawaykit is also good: a royal blue lightning bolt-ish pattern that harks back to themid-90s’ on-the-road design, and only mildly – unintentionally – reminds one of the Victoria line moquette. The beautiful, art deco-influencedthird kitin cream and burgundy features the Adidastrefoil logo, AKA the one that looks like the top half of a ganja leaf. Apart from that, you would be happy to take it home to your mum.Do not ask me why Arsenal needfivegoalkeeper shirts, but you will find David Raya in any of the following (deep breath):green; a slightly darker green;yellow and red; yellow and black; purple.Aston VillaView image in fullscreenAston Villa’s new home look.Photograph: Adidas/Aston Villa FCThe sleeve of Villa’s Adidas home strip ostensibly “pays homage” to the club stadium. This seems to be a common – but too often shoddily executed – theme this year. But the Villans’ top actually does reference Villa Park in a way that is recognisable; the cuff features the same intricate gold design that adorns theHolte End facade. The main shirt colour way is the classic claret and blue; the shorts are white. The socks feature a gold “AV” monogram.Theaway fitis a mostly black design with grey raglan sleeve. It is OK, I guess; but it does slightly remind one of when the printer runs out of colour ink. Unlike thethird kit, which is basically what would happen if a toddler was let loose with purple and blue finger-paints. A joy.As for the home goalkeeper jersey: you know when the doctor asks what colour phlegm you are bringing up, in case you have pneumonia? Usually indicated by an intense green? Well, it isnot looking goodfor Emi Martínez (or his potential replacement) …BournemouthView image in fullscreenThe Cherries’ and their rippled sand-effect strip.Photograph: Umbro/Bournemouth FCThere is no more awkward sponsor logo than the “bj88” slapped on the front of the Cherries’ shirts. It is difficult to see past such misfortune to assess the Umbro-made kit itself, but suffice to say it consists of black and red vertical stripes. In a hint at the club’s beachside location, there is a delightful “rippled sand” effect within the stripes. (And, for anyone fancying their chances with a metal detector along the coastline, the collar and cuff boast a gold trim.)Theaway stripis a throwback to the blue and black epoch – the Cherries if you’d packed them at the bottom of the shopping bag – with the crest and Umbro logo embroidered. Which is as it should be: I do not want to tell you how manyTPUbadges I have lost to bathroom radiators. Thethird kitis pastel pink. Thehome goalkeeper kitis a luminous green; theawaya bright purple.BrentfordView image in fullscreenBrentford’s new signing? Joma.Photograph: Joma/Brentford FCThomas Frank’s departureis not the only change for the Bees this year: their kit supplier, formerly Umbro, is now Joma. The Spanish brand has done well (what do you mean you have never heard of them? Do you not watch tennis players who rank in the low-tens?) The kit celebrates the centenary of the traditional red-and-white colour scheme with a breezy “100” signoff on the back of the collar (although it is giving “ran out of space at the bottom of the page” so the handwriting starts to slide into the margin).In keeping with the anniversary celebrations, the design echoes the 1925 strip; broad stripes with pinstripe edging. The collar is a modern take on the classic lace-up. Now, I do not know if there is a job-share situation going on at Joma, but while the home strip slaps, the away one is … well. The players will be running out in what I can only describe as asoil-brown monstrosity. (Maybe it is a literal grower.) The goalie outfit, meanwhile, is a bright pink number. Thethird kitis a little meh; a pale blue, salmon, and burgundy – hues borrowed from the club’s pre-red ‘n’ white era.BrightonView image in fullscreenBrighton’s new home kit, with a turquoise touch.Photograph: Nike/Brighton & Hove Albion FCBrighton’s new home strip is the first ever to feature the colour of “Hyper Turq”. This is because “Hyper Turq” is a colour Nike has made up. As the name suggests, it is turquoise. It is a nice touch (including on the Nike swoosh and underarm panels) on what can – apologies – historically be a pretty dull blue-and-white affair. PlusHyper Turqturquoise is the colour of Brighton’s seafront railings. The smart v-shaped collar bears the quote: “WE ARE BRIGHTON”.The round-neckedaway kitis a lilac and mauve mix. Interestingly, both the Nike swoosh and crest are centrally aligned, which makes for a pleasingly streamlined aesthetic. In a rare example of club owners not trying to squeeze every last penny from loyal supporters, Brighton tend to repurpose the previous season’s away kit as the next third kit, which, at present, looks to be the case again (despite an earlier statementsaying otherwise). The threekeeper kitsare in yellow, orange, and black. Nike did their best work this season in the “city by the sea” (embroidered on the back).BurnleyView image in fullscreenCastore’s classy new Burnley kit.Photograph: Burnley’s new home kit from press release/Castore/Burnley FCWelcome back, lads. It is good to see you – especially because Castore has created some lovely new fits. The home shirt is in the traditional claret and features an ultra-fine topographical pattern representing the contours of Lancashire’s countryside and the heights of the Pennines. This actually works, unlike when manufactures “take inspiration” from something and then just whack on a standard, or unidentifiable, motif.Theaway shirtis sky blue and has a decoration resembling cirrus clouds (those are the streaky ones; yes, I did pay attention in GCSE geography – ask me about onion skin weathering, I beg you. Anyone) – although apparently they are meant to be sound waves. All in all it is a very soothing kit, as opposed to the multiple vibrant keeper strips, which strongly suggest attendance at theHoli festival. The third kit will be a much more hangover-friendlyblack with gold trim.ChelseaView image in fullscreenChelsea’s cool new shirt, again featuring no sponsor.Photograph: Nike/Chelsea FCDolly Parton oncedescribedher style as “costing a lot of money to look this cheap”; and it has to be said that the wealthier legacy clubs often seem to follow the same mantra. But Chelsea, celebrating their 120th anniversary, have scrubbed up well – if a little blandly – for the new season. Nike’s marketing spiel is that the jersey’s (extremely) subtle pattern “embodies the youthful spirit that has shaped west London”.Reggie Walsh– the club’s current 16-year-old squad member – will be pleased. They also managed to getSuggsin the promo video. Madness.The kit is the usual heritage colour of dark blue, but has red and white underarm inserts in a modern twist. The shirt will also boast a goldClub World Cupwinners’ badge. As in recent seasons, a front-of-shirt sponsor is absent. The club isholding outfor a lucrative long-term deal – although not signing a short one in the meantime does not seem to make a massive amount of business sense, IMHO. Shirts do look so much better without giant, garish logos though – especially when the logos are those of gambling companies. The home keeper shirt comes inblack, and the away is green.The outfield away strip is much more interesting. Officially in the colours of “Phantom” (that’s white to you and me), and “Galactic Jade” (otherwise known as green) and red (red), the design is a nod to the club’s 1974-75 Magnificent Magyars-eraaway look. There are also some centralised pinstripes to add flair. The third kit is yet to be released, but is rumoured to feature the1990s club crest.Crystal PalaceView image in fullscreenThe reigning FA Cup winners’ new home strip.Photograph: Macron/Crystal Palace FCThe Italian brand Macron is again producing the Eagles’ fits. The home, of course, features the classic red-and-blue vertical stripes, but this time the stripes include white bands in between them for a refined feel. The cuffs are also white – as are the sleek shoulder panels. It is a classy kit; far nicer thanlast season’s “experimental” effortwhich looked for all the world like an 80s pub carpet. Thekeeper kitis a light green.The away kit, complete with Mandarin collar, is abold, gold affairto celebrate the club’s jubilant2025 FA Cup win. The PR people are calling it the “Golden Eagle” kit, which is a pun I can 100% get behind. No update, at the time of writing, on the third look.EvertonView image in fullscreenAnother successful kit from Castore.Photograph: Castore/Everton FCDespite the Toffees finishing unexpectedly rather well last season (given the inauspicious start, anyway); being reunited with beloved manager David Moyes; and moving into a brand new stadium, the club hasstruggled to securequality additions during the transfer window. But should they materialise, the new signings will have the privilege of wearing an attractive and intelligent Castore strip.Both the body and sleeve of the home shirt – in a familiar Everton blue – feature a prominent wave pattern to represent the River Mersey and the club’s new waterfront ground. The socks, paired with white shorts, showcase the silhouette of local landmark,Prince Rupert’s Tower(also an integral part of the club crest).Theaway stripis a pale yellow for shirt and socks, with blue shorts. The cuff features a design that mirrors the railway line which used to serve Liverpool’s docklands. The third kit is rumoured to have a black base and Prince Rupert’s Tower on the chest instead of the club’s full badge. Meanwhile, Jordan Pickford will either be in a green jacquard number (home) or black (away).FulhamView image in fullscreenFulham’s ‘clean and contemporary’ new strip.Photograph: Adidas/Fulham FCFulham have announced their “clean and contemporary” 2025-26 home strip; and clean and contemporary is an accurate description of the v-necked, zero-red, all-white fit (with piping, Adidas logo, and the brand’s famous stripes on the shoulder all in black). The aesthetically agreeable home jersey also features arubber emblemof Craven Cottagebalcony’s wrought ironwork. Compensating for the white-domination of the outfield look, the keeper will wearall red with metallic detail.The away strip is also a looker, and heavily reminiscent of the club’s 1999-20lime green awaythreads. It shows off an oversized retro collar and the club crest of the same era. Back in the day the club sponsor was an internet service provider calledDemon Internet; a company which no longer exists, but turns out had a very prophetic name. No news yet on the third kit.Leeds UnitedView image in fullscreenLeeds’s new kit, with mosaic-patterned detail.Photograph: Adidas/Leeds United FCThe Leeds Adidas-made home kit stays traditional with the main colourway of white, blue, and yellow. But, consistent with a popular concept in kit design this year, there is a cute pattern inspired by the mosaic tile of the Lowfields Tunnel – the route Whites fans often take to Elland Road – which adds pizzaz to what is otherwise a simple but gratifyingly polished, attractive look for the club’s return to the top tier.Theaway stripis predominantly blue with multiple yellow touches, including an all-yellow twist on sponsor Red Bull’s logo. The goalkeeper kits are in a lighter blue (home) and orange (away), as well asdeep purple. Thethird kitis a few alcopops down; a dizzying, chaotic mishmash of the traditional three colours. But I rather like it; it is everything but dull.LiverpoolView image in fullscreenLiverpool and Adidas return as a match made in heaven.Photograph: Adidas/Liverpool FCLiverpool start their season dealing with a maelstrom of emotions. There is the triumph of last season’s title win and plenty of exciting new faces – Florian WirtzandJeremie Frimpongamong them.But there is tragedy too: thedeath of Diego Jota, as well asthe incidentat the title parade that left scores of fans injured.Joining Wirtz et al is another addition to the club: Adidas. The brand has signed a10-year dealwith the club after Liverpool ended their five-year Nike stint. And a brand responsible for some of the club’s most iconic strips has hit the ground running: the home outfit is an all-red affair (officially “Strawberry Red”) with a white crewneck collar and cuff. The simplifiedLiver Bird emblemremains instead of the full crest (which personally I wish would make a comeback …)The away effort is also beautiful: an off-white jersey complemented by red and dark green accents. The shirt is paired with a choice of either a black short and white sock, or the reverse. Meanwhile, thethird kitis a mint green, which calls to mind theearly 90s awaydrip.Manchester CityView image in fullscreenManchester City’s sleek new home kit complete with sash.Photograph: Puma/Manchester City FCWell done to Puma, who have designed a lovely home uniform here. It is the standard sky blue (with navy blue accents), but a sash features for the first time on a City home shirt (it has been a frequent away design element). The collar shade is the same as the body, creating a clean, smooth aesthetic.Theaway kitis an all-black number referencing the club’s earliest known strip. Either that or they are going through their Johnny Cash era/a severe depression. It is dashing, though, and if one were to attempt to enter a Michelin-starred restaurant in a footie top, this is the one I would probably go for (see also: a funeral). Thethird kitis causing quite the reaction online – none of it good. The neon green accents are proving especially unpopular, but for my money* the raindrops-inspired main design on a drizzly-grey jersey for a club located in the soggy north-west is a stroke of genius.LS Lowry would be proud. Thegoalie kitsare available in many loud colourways, including fuchsia.*But not literally because YNWA.Manchester UnitedView image in fullscreenUnited they stand …?Photograph: Adidas/Manchester United/Adidas/Manchester United FCThe Red Devils have been promoting their new home strip with the strapline: “United, wherever we go.” Bold, given that the club has five playershankering for a move, all of whom are only allowed to train at Carrington after the rest of the squad has gone home.The Adidas kit ostensibly pays homage to Old Trafford – a slightly odd decision now that Jim Ratcliffe hasannouncedthe 115-year-old stadium is to be replaced with a Norman Foster-designed behemoth (currently assigned the Ronseal-esque name of “New Trafford”). The back of the collar reads “Theatre of Dreams” – if the dream is to finish 15th – while the sleeve incorporates an “abstract” pattern referencing the stadium. After close inspection, I can report that this is a very, very abstract reference indeed.Theaway kitis white with plum accents and a lavender snowflake motif inspired by the1990-92 strip. The colour scheme brings to mind the Jenny Josephcouplet: “When I am old / I shall wear purple”; just a thought in case the 40-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo fancies a hat-trick of United stretches. The third kit is the best of the three; a black and yellow strip reminiscent of the1993-94 away kit.Newcastle UnitedView image in fullscreenNewcastle’s new home kit featuring Shepherd’s plaid.Photograph: Adidas/Newcastle United FCDespite the Magpies’ extremely feelgoodCarabao Cup winlast season – marking a first domestic triumph in 70 years for this storied and well-loved club – it still pains me somewhat to compliment a team majority-owned by a regime whose greatest hits includedismemberment by bone-saw.But kit manufacturer Adidas continues its (for the most part) good summer run here. Clubs with traditional monochrome colours can sometimes struggle to distinguish themselves, but Adidas has introduced a serrated edge to those classic, thick black stripes. The border pattern is officially known asShepherds’ plaid, although it actually reminds me offrits(those little black dots at the bottom of windscreens). Other elements include blue piping and an “HOWAY THE LADS” inscription on the back of the collar.Theaway kitis not as much reminiscent of a Saudi national team kit as could quite literally be a Saudi national team kit of before. Thethird kit, in burnt orange and blue, is a fun number with a stitched crest; inspired by that incrediblelate 90s away piece. It has the Adidas trefoil logo to maximise the retro feel. Thegoaliegarms come in yellow, blue, purple, and pink, respectively.Nottingham ForestView image in fullscreenForest’s handsome home kit, combining old and new.Photograph: Adidas/Nottingham Forest FCForest’s new home kit is a throwback to itsfavoured early 90s strip, sharing the same polo-style collar and a wide pinstripe body. It is an extremely classy affair from Adidas, with a nice added detail being the also 90s-inspired shield crest. The keeper willwear yellow, orange, or blue. When the club, after its successful last season,initially releasedthe new home shirt it was yet to feature a front sponsor – and was all the more handsome for it. But now, just in time for the team’s opening game, it advertises … a betting company. Surprise, surprise.Theaway fitis primarily cream and features a neat detail: a weave replicating the lace designs the city is famous for. No third kit news at the time of writing.SunderlandView image in fullscreenThe new Sunderland shirt with its centrally aligned badge.Photograph: Hummel/Sunderland FCDanish brand Hummel frequently punches above its weight, and this smart new effort for Sunderland’s return to the top flight is no different.But not everybody is happy: the back of the players’ home shirt (but not the fan replica) iscatching flakfrom supporters for the number placement – a white panel has been introduced to abide by Premier League legibility rules. The rest of the shirt is an elegant creation; a black v-neck with thin bands of the traditional red-and-white is a key characteristic. Also eye-catching is the crest placement; centrally aligned for the first time since the 1990s. And why shouldn’t the Black Cats show it off when it is one of the prettiest around?In a similar move to Leeds, Sunderland’s snazzygoalie kitsallude to thepatterned tilesof a city landmark (in this case, the Bridge Hotel); while the gorgeously retro royal-blueaway outfieldthreads are further livened by a chequerboard weave with a subtle Roker Beach lighthouse motif. Thethird kitis an all-black number because: Black Cats, geddit?Tottenham HotspurView image in fullscreenA winning kit for the Europa League champions.Photograph: Nike/Tottenham Hotspur FCSpurs’s home kits have been rather banal and indistinguishable for a while now (sorry), but Nike has come up with something a little fresher this time for the Europa Leagueholders(although that is no consolationfor the departing Son). As with Sunderland, the new Spurs home shirt has a centrally aligned brand logo and club badge. The sleeve and underarm panels incorporate “Iron Ore” as an accent colour (Nike is at it again; they are grey), which is a departure, and ribbing on the body provides texture.Fans and players will also be wearing navy shorts with white socks. It is definitely the club’s least insipid home strip for a long time – although it retains a slight whiff of the training ground. More rousing is the luminous pink-and purple-gradient pinstripekeeper’s kit.The Lilywhites go all black withtheir away look– a prevalent choice this upcoming season. The Spurs kit in particular reminds one of Roger Federer’siconic 2007 US Open drip. Nike’s blurb describes it as “razor-sharp, engineered for speed and built for stealth”, which unfortunately does sound a lot like club legend Harry Kane in his prime. Theaway keeper’s kitis akin to the home one but in mint-and-forest green. Thethird kit is yet to be officially launched, but it looks as though the bright yellow and navy shirt will air the beautiful 90s-era crest.West HamView image in fullscreenJarrod Bowen models the Hammers’ new minimalist look.Photograph: Umbro/West Ham UnitedUmbro has gone back to basics for the Hammers’ fetching new home strip. The traditional claret colour is the majority presence, but it is the dapper taping detail on the ribbed collar and cuff – and discreet underarm blue inserts (the colour is relegated to a smaller role than usual) – that subtly elevate this minimalist take. The applique full club crest is revived here after last season’s hideous variation and the crossed-hammers symbol is also printed on the back of the neck. The socks and shorts are in white.Theaway stripis equally nice and calm. Supposedly it is a callback to the1996-97 away strip; I would argue that the call is not particularly loud. But it is a satisfyingly soft, creamy ecru with black sleeves and collar. Thethird kit, with a fold-over collar and a striking oversized Hammers logo on the breast, is a mix of submarine-deep navy as well as gold. Where the Umbro designers have had their welcome sugar rush is with thekeeper kits; each of which (in blue, orange, and lilac) has a jaunty shoulder and sleeve decoration.Wolverhampton WanderersView image in fullscreenWolves’ 2025-26 transformation.Photograph: Sudu/Wolverhampton Wonderers FCWolves’ latest home kit, made by Sudu, schools us on the history of Molineux. Before the site served as a football stadium, it was the location of the Molineux Pleasure Gardens; a Victorian public park with amusement offerings typical of the period. The traditional gold jersey features a debossed, ornamental print of swirls and shapes to honour that sense of fun. The overall look – from collar to cuff – is influenced by the club’s 70s threads. Thehome goalie kitis black and features the same print.The first-choice goalkeeper José Sá will wearpinkfor away fixtures, while the outfield players will be hitting the grassin turquoise; again, quite a popular colour for teams this season. This time the general feel is 80s-inspired, with dark green (almost black) ribbed collar and cuff. The third kit is yet to be released at the time of writing.Explore more on these topicsFootballPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

With 36 seconds remaining in the game, she grabbed her 20th board to match the personal record she established in July 2024 at Seattle. Her Las Vegas teammates led the home crowd in applause for the milestone.The WNBA’s sex toy epidemic is Skibidi brainrot writ large. Trolling has replaced meaning with noise | Lee EscobedoRead more“It’s just A’ja being A’ja,” said Aces coach Becky Hammon. “She probably could have had one of these in the past. I never let her really go to the offensive glass this year, where we’ve been emphasizing that more.”Las Vegas gave up 31 first-quarter points, then another 14 less than five minutes through the second period to fall behind 45-33. But they regrouped, holding Connecticut (5-25) without a point for the next 5:45 during a 12-0 run to draw the score even by halftime. The defensive tenacity carried over into the second half. Las Vegas surrendered as many points in the second and third quarters combined as they allowed in the opening period, in the process flipping the early, double-digit point deficit into a double-digit point lead by the late third.“It’s huge,” Wilson said. “I didn’t even know, as many greats as we have in this league, it’s kind of a shocker that it’s just now happening. It’s a blessing. I love what I do. I love what I do. I love it so much, so anytime that I can come out and just play basketball the way that I love it, and the team, and we’re all getting involved – I’m happy with that.”Wilson’s heroics bolstered the Aces on a day when three of the five starters failed to score more than seven points. Jackie Young was the exception with 21 points on 9-of-14 shooting from the floor. Young also dished six assists to match Chelsea Gray’s game-high total. Jewell Loyd and Dana Evans helped pick up some of the offensive slack with 12 and 10 points off the bench.The loss dropped Connecticut to 0-3 on their current road swing, which concludes on Monday in San Francisco against Golden State.Explore more on these topicsLas Vegas AcesConnecticut SunWNBAUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now it is the time to see what he can do in Los Angeles on the field and what the club can do off it.Son Heung-min makes instant impact in LAFC debut and hails MLS welcomeRead more“They’ve got 24 months to milk the hell out of it,” Sasi Kumar, a former Singapore international and founder of sports marketing agency Red Card Global, told the Guardian. “The commercial opportunities are obvious, staring LAFC in the face.”Son has been the main man in Asian soccer for years: a golden boot and Puskas award recipient who lifted one of European football’s biggest trophies as a captain of a major club just months ago. Having one of the biggest stars in the world’s most popular league for so long was a matter of national pride in Korea and appealed across Asia. It fueled his superstardom. Son has helped to ensure that, now, pretty much every talented young Korean star wants to go straight to England’s top tier.MLS does not enjoy anywhere close to the same stature – there has traditionally been little interest in the league in Asia, and it was barely mentioned as a possible destination for the 33-year-old. There has been a debate in Korea going back a few years when and where Son should go – a club like Barcelona was the one often mentioned. Even when the forward struggled for form and fitness last season, there were still options in Europe, where most expected him to stay. A move to Saudi Arabia was always unlikely. For a player who has never played in the K-League, going to a rival Asian competition may not have gone down well in his homeland where he has been the face of more than 30 brands. Still,MLSwas not, initially, a popular choice.“At the beginning, the fans’ reaction was divided as some wanted Son to stay in Europe and play in the Champions League for at least one more season,” said Lee Seung-mo, a Seoul-based author and journalist. “However, after Son explained why he chose LAFC and MLS, now the majority of fans understand and support his decision.” Being based Stateside also makes sense ahead of the World Cup, likely to be Son’s fourth and last appearance at the tournament.Lee admits that not all the fans who have watched Son in England will watch him in the US. “It won’t be 100% the same in MLS in terms of viewership as the Premier League has the most fans of any league but most Son fans will want to watch MLS.”View image in fullscreenFans at the game between Chicago Fire and LAFC.Photograph: Patrick McDermott/Getty ImagesThose years at the top of the game have made Son into such an icon in his homeland that he can transcend any competition he plays in. “His image cuts across different demographics, geography – everything,” said Kumar. “Whenever Spurs played you got Asians from all of Asia supporting him, he’s such a loveable character, you didn’t need to be a Spurs fan to like him,”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While MLS may not be the EPL, the USA is also not the UK. Economically, South Korea already has a strong connection with the US, sending almost 20% of exports in an export-based economy to the United States in 2024, compared to just 1% for Great Britain. “The Korean market is so connected to the US; it is a huge market for Korean beauty products, electronics, cars, phones etc,” Kumar said. “Son has provided a platform and opportunity to enter the market with a huge asset. The obvious thing for LAFC is to tour Asia and they should actively look in different markets for brand and content partnerships. LAFC’s commercial team will be working overtime how to sell digital assets, image rights and work with global brands like Samsung and Kia.”Such Korean companies have always been involved in sports (the K.League was – and, to a large extent, still is- based on corporate ownership and Hyundai has been hugely influential in the Korean Football Association over the years) and there should be plenty of knowhow on the opposite side. “What is well known about American sports in general is that they are arguably the best in sports marketing, and I’m sure LAFC and MLS both will try their best in Korean market,” said Lee.The fact that LA have made such a big deal of the signing has gone down well. Steve Han is a LA-based Korean content lead for Fifa and host of Fairpoint podcast and has witnessed the excitement. “At the introductory press conference, there were Korean journalists who attended with LAFC shirts on,” Han told the Guardian. “⁠For years, LAFC have already been one of the most well-branded clubs in MLS. Even the contents that the club pushed out so far have really got the fans excited. The stage is set for Son to put the icing on the cake now.”Explore more on these topicsMLSLos Angeles FCUS sportsSouth KoreafeaturesShareReuse this content"

They finished a distant third and lostthe FA Cup final, leaving them trophyless. The latest crop of incomings got a brief taste of life under Pep Guardiola at the Club World Cup and all showed promise. AfterRodri missed most of last season, it feels as if his fitness will decide the fate of the team. If Guardiola can get him back to his best – and keep him fit – after a horrible injury, then City can feel excited once again.Guardiola has indicated City need to adapt to the evolution of football, having struggled with the increase in physicality and fitness that has blunted their skills. There could be a greater emphasis on dribbling past opponents to try to open up the spaces. Rayan Cherki, Phil Foden, Jérémy Doku and Savinho will be extremely important in apost-Kevin De Bruyne world. City struggled more than ever when it came to breaking down teams last season and Guardiola felt his team were unable to cope with the physicality of others.It will be interesting to see who gets the nod in goal on the opening weekend. Ederson has been Guardiola’s No 1 for years, butthe arrival of James Traffordcould change that. The Brazilian has redefined the position and Trafford, a former City academy player, is part of a new generation who followed his strategy and have attempted to replicate his ability to distribute the ball short and long. Trafford is young and not the finished article, but he has all the qualities to be a world-class goalkeeper for years to come.At the other end, Erling Haaland will be as dangerous as always, with fitness the only question mark hanging over him after some disruptions. Unlike this time last year, Guardiola has a second striker he can all upon if needs be in Omar Marmoush. The Egyptian was integral in reigniting City’s seasonafter arriving in Januaryand should be fully settled, giving them extra dimensions.Graph of Manchester City’s finishes in the past five seasonsThe managerPep Guardiola took last season personally, upset with himself for failing to arrest the slide and irritated by underperforming players. He will not accept a similar showing this season, especially after the sizable outlay on reshaping the squad. Guardiola overhauled his coaching staff, with the most eye-catching appointment being Jürgen Klopp’s former No 2 Pep Ljinders, who joins as an assistant coach. The change in personnel will bring new ideas, something Guardiola was seeking as he sought a refresh on the pitch and in the dugout.Off-field pictureThose pesky chargesjust will not go away for Manchester City and the Premier League. It feels as if this situation has dragged on since Adam was a lad and rivals will continue to use it as a stick to beat the club with, while City plead innocence and claim a witch-hunt. No one is satisfied with the state of affairs and everyone will want finality as soon as possible because it is a constant distraction. A freeze on ticket prices brought some goodwill after lengthy criticism of the club’s desire to squeeze every penny they could out of supporters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 21-year-old has been linked with top clubs since his teenage years, but City finally got their hands on Lyon’s attacking midfielder, who falls into the maverick category. He dribbles, creates and scores goals, while also possessing the ability to produce the unpredictable with the ball at his feet, and he can play in numerous positions behind a striker. It is hard to predict what he will do next, which will concern defenders. In an era when football is prescribed, Cherki can be the rule breaker.Stepping upA year ago, Oscar Bobb scoredin the Community Shieldto signal he was about to break out. He had enjoyed a great pre-season and Guardiola was confident in his qualities. The highly rated Bobb was the reason City werehappy to part with Cole Palmer, thinking they had someone who could surpass him in their ranks. Unfortunately for Bobb, he broke a leg in training and required a lengthy rehabilitation period, taking longer than anyone expected, meaning he made three Premier League appearances, all as a substitute. There is greater competition in the positions he wants to play, but given a chance he could be a star turn.Bar chart of Manchester City’s resultsA big season for …By his own admission, 2024-25 did not live up to Phil Foden’s high standards. Fromclaiming the Professional Footballers’ Association’s player of the yearaward for the previous season, Foden dropped off dramatically. He attributed the problems on the pitch to various factors, including facing challenges“off the pitch mentally”and it is understandable that those affected his ability to perform. The 25-year-old is a generational talent, possessing everything his manager wants in a player, and he will be desperate to show it. Given the correct freedom, he should be the man leading the latest incarnation of Guardiola’s football and a new era at City.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26Manchester CityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Parish had been confident that the club’s appeal against their demotion from the Europa League would succeed as he discussed their prospects at Wembley Stadium after beating Liverpool in the Community Shield on Sunday.“I really am, even more after Friday,” the club chair said. “I don’t understand that we cannot be in the competition. I really can’t. But it’s up to the judges to decide. We trust them and that they listened to everything we said so let’s see.”Crystal Palace keen to sell captain Marc Guéhi before transfer window closesRead moreConfirmation from the court of arbitration for sport that it had upheld the decision made by Uefa’s club financial control body to punish Palace for breaching its multi-club ownership rules has brought Parish and the team’s fans back to earth.The Cas statement made clear the role of John Textor, the American businessman who last month sold his 43% stake in Palace to the New York Jets owner, Woody Johnson, was decisive. Textor has admitted that seconds after Palace’s victoryagainst Manchester City in the FA Cup finalin May that he feared the worst regarding participation in the Europa League, given that he owns Lyon, who also qualified.The Cas panel – consisting of a Dutch former striker, a Swiss former fencer who competed in the 1984 Olympics, and an Italian professor – backed Uefa’s findings that Textor “was a board member with decisive influence over both clubs at the time of Uefa’s assessment date”. It also dismissed Palace’s argument that they had received unfair treatment compared to Nottingham Forest and Lyon, and said missing the 1 March deadline for Textor to place his shares into a blind trust had been crucial.Textor has been the target of most Palace fans’ frustration, although several have also taken aim at the Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis. Forest, who are poised to take Palace’s Europa League place, wrote to Uefa a few weeks after the FA Cup final expressing concern that Palace may have contravened multi-club ownership regulations.Parish suggestedlast month in an interview with Gary Lineker that their Premier League rivals had played a role in the decision to ban them. “We were told that and I think it’s been made public,” he said. “These things seem to be played out in public. There doesn’t seem to be a lot of confidentiality that comes out of certain organisations. But we’re led to believe that’s the issue – if there wasn’t somebody that wanted to get in as a consequence, then there wouldn’t be a problem.“People have got to look at themselves. Some people will say it’s fine, some people will say it’s not. I don’t really have control of that. I only have control of the arguments that we put forward to Uefa.” Forest declined to comment on Parish’s remarks at the time.View image in fullscreenMarc Guéhi at Wembley during Sunday’s win against Liverpool.Photograph: John Patrick Fletcher/Action Plus/ShutterstockPalace’s case is believed to have included evidence that only members of the European Club Association were informed Uefa’s 1 March deadline for complying with multi-club rules could be extended until 31 May – a fact that enabled Marinakis to place Forest into a blind trust when it seemed they might qualify for the Champions League along with his Greek club, Olympiakos.Palace are also understood to have highlighted the burgeoning friendship between Marinakis and Textor. The American denies that had any bearing on his conduct and described as untrue reports he is planning to incorporate his Brazilian club Botafogo into the Greek shipping magnate’s network of clubs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Marinakis has resumed control of shares in the two-time European champions after they finished seventh in the Premier League.Their supporters can look forward to the Europa League’s league stage while Palace prepare for a Conference League playoff against the losers of the Europa League qualifier between Norway’s Fredrikstad and Midtjylland. The Danish side lead 3-1 going into their home leg on Thursday.It is estimated demotion will cost Palace up to £20m in lost revenue, given the Conference League’s league stage has two fewer games than the Europa League’s, although Oliver Glasner will fancy his chances of winning a competition that has had two English winners in its first four editions.The chance for Palace to play in Europe for the first time since a short-lived Intertoto Cup experience in 1998, when they qualified after being the only English team to apply for entry, will be consolation for a club that also missed out in 1991 when they finished third in the First Division.

Southampton have rejected three offers from Everton for Tyler Dibling, the latest at about £40m, and are holding out for about £50m.

The under-23 manager, Sonia Bermúdez, has been appointed to replace Tomé, with the former Spain international to be assisted by Iraia Iturregi in a new joint model.Tomé was appointed in 2023, the assistant manager taking over from Jorge Vilda, who was sacked afterSpain’s first World Cup win. Long-held frustrations boiled over after the federation’s then president Luis Rubiales’s inappropriate actions during the medal ceremony,including kissing Jenni Hermoso.Tomé left Hermoso out of her first squad, citing a need to protect her, a decision the player criticised. She guided the team to the2023-24 Nations League titleand to the final of Women’s Euro 2025,where they lost against England last month.The federation’s board thanked Tomé for “her work, professionalism and dedication in various roles during her time as a member of the national teams at the RFEF, especially during her time as the national team coach”.Bermúdez scored 35 goals in 63 games for Spain and played for Rayo Vallecano, Barcelona, Western New York Flash, Atlético Madrid and Levante, winning nine league titles and three Copa de la Reina trophies. She coached the under-19 and under-20 women’s national teams, winning two consecutive European titles, before taking charge of the under-23 side.Iturregi played 15 seasons in the Spanish top flight, winning four league titles with Athletic Club.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With the RFEF’s approval, the matter now requires the approval of Fifa, Uefa, and the host federation and confederation (US Soccer and Concacaf, respectively).The match in question was due to be played at Villarreal’s home ground, the Estadio de la Cerámica, on 21 December. The proposed moving of the fixture will bring it to Hard Rock Stadium, home of the NFL’s Miami Dolphins. The Dolphins are due to host the Cincinnati Bengals at Hard Rock Stadium on 21 December, so it’s likely that the date of the La Liga fixture will need to be moved.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Notably, Relevent was founded and is owned by Stephen Ross, a real estate developer and the owner of the Dolphins and Hard Rock Stadium.Relevent had initially suedFifaand US Soccer in 2019 after attempting to hold a La Liga match in Miami the previous year – a proposal that US Soccer refused to sanction on account of a Fifa statute barring domestic league games from taking place away from their home territory. Relevent sued, contending the policy violated the United States’ Sherman Antitrust Act – an 1890 piece of legislation designed to combat monopolies. Fifa and Relevent eventually settled their case with the understanding that Fifa would revisit the statute. The sides settled the case without prejudice, allowing Relevent the option of reopening litigation.Relevent made its name by hosting a number of pre-season events in the US featuring big-name European clubs. This year the organization signed a six-season deal withUefato be its global marketing and sales partner for men’s club competitions, giving it the ability to sell rights to the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League.Explore more on these topicsLa LigaBarcelonaVillarrealEuropean club footballUefaFifaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Somehow,the Community Shield– or, to give it its proper name, The Annual Curtain-Raiser – has negotiated the logistical nightmare that is a transfer window yet to slam shut, revealing a game that, in a shocking turn of events, did not encourage one to pretend that football does not and has never existed.Liverpool took just four minutes to go in front with a gift significantly more charitable than the Shield itself: the opportunity to hear “Ekitike” said in a scouse accent, a joy perhaps even more intense than Ross Barkleysaying “Lukaku”. And what a finish it was, the champions’ new striker showing exactly why a team which scored 86 league goals last season – 14 more than the next best – invested so much money in him and the also-impressive Florian Wirtz (if only they’d not conceded 41, the most of any title winner in 12 years). Arne Slot does, though, hope to address the imbalance by spending considerably more than £100m on Alexander Isak.In the meantime, though, his team are able to rely on the mononymaniacal “Virgil” who, after conceding the penalty from which Jean-Philippe Mateta equalised, treated all bar the -67 to one of the finest sights in all sport: righteous indignance at the effrontery of the cosmos in failing to accept divinity of his will. Were there hilarious puns to be made comparing the Aeneid to a body-part, or the Iliad to an intelligence-challenging insult, we would surely dive in, but sadly there are not. It wasn’t long before Liverpool retook the lead, courtesy of Jeremie Frimpong’s fluke second goal. Palace, though, remained uncowed, fighting their way back into the contest and, in the second half, looking the likelier scorers. But just as they looked like running out of steam, Milos Kerkez – a left-back better going forwards than backwards, signed to replace Andy Robertson, etc and so on – lost track of his whereabouts, in the process allowing Ismaïla Sarr to equalise.View image in fullscreenIsmaïla Sarr is brought down for a penalty.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesPalace might then have won the match in normal time, but with a cross into the box looking dangerous, Alexis Mac Allister – arm well away from his body and raised to shoulder-height – took the ball away from Sarr. Oddly, Virgil’s search for truth was less pronounced this time – likewise that of the officials – so to penalties we went, a shootout of notable incompetence failing to provoke the dignified gentlemen of the internet into a flurry of misandric rage and condescension. The Daily can only conclude they are all somewhere in America, among the -67 still rapt by the sight of Trump cavorting with Infantino.QUOTE OF THE DAY“After considering the evidence, the panel found that John Textor, founder of Eagle Football Holdings, had shares in CPFC and [Lyon] and was a board member with decisive influence over both clubs at the time of Uefa’s assessment date. The panel also dismissed the argument by CPFC that they received unfair treatment in comparison to Nottingham Forest and OL. The panel considered that the Uefa regulations are clear and do not provide flexibility to clubs that are non-compliant on the assessment date, as CPFC claimed” – a quick comedown meansit’s Tin Pot for Crystal Palaceafter they lost their appeal against demotion from Bigger Vase at Cas. And beyond that they’re also looking tosell Marc Guéhi, sharpish.View image in fullscreenPalace fans vent at Uefa.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/ShutterstockFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERSHannah Hampton’sskulduggery(Friday’s Quote of the Day) at the business end of the Euros final certainly puts a new slant on the notion of a player losing their bottle during a shootout. Buried somewhere deep down, 1% of me wonders whether she should be admonished. The other 99% looks at the bare-faced cheek of what she did, and how joyously she’s owned it since, and thinks – what an absolute, unparalleled star” – Phil Taverner.Hampton had likely seen the [flamin’] antics of Socceroos substitute keeper Andrew Redmayneat a World Cup qualifier against Peru in 2022. As well as his stalling tactics and windmill-waving arms, Redmayne saw that the Peruvian keeper had notes of Australia’s penalty takers taped to his water bottle; names, faces and likely directions of the shots. As soon as he spotted it, Redmayne walked over, picked up the water bottle and threw it towards the stands, robbing Pedro Gallese of any advantage or insight. A beloved example of Australian sh!thousery” – Gerry Suchy.Can I just express my appreciation for the contribution ofDarwin Núñez’s time at Liverpool? His talent was there for all to see and his ability to score incredible goals from impossible situations was unfortunately dwarfed by his ability to miss the most obvious opportunities. It was his misfortune to be on the same team as Luis Díaz, who was much more successful in his similar role. I have come to realise that football is not about perfection or the expectation of perfection, despite what internet trolls would ascertain. I will miss his frustrating manifestation of the human side to the game.

A seventh Champions League triumph will also be considered a realistic target by Arne Slot.Expectations are high at Anfield but any analysis of the club must consider the immeasurable impact ofDiogo Jota’s tragic deathon teammates and colleagues. It is the unknown factor in their title defence.On paper Liverpool have upgraded the squad thatwon the Premier Leaguewith four matches to spare and handed Slot greater depth and versatility for his second season. The head coach rotated sparingly in the league and his approach was rewarded handsomely. Slot, however, felt that fatigue caught up with the team during a sequence of 30 matches between November and March and he should have made more changes for theCarabao Cup final defeat by Newcastle. Expect more rotation this season.Liverpool have added pace in both full-back positions with the signings ofMilos KerkezandJeremie Frimpong, two parts of a statement transfer window when they spent almost £300m.Hugo Ekitikéwas signed from under Newcastle’s noses after a breakthrough season with Eintracht Frankfurt and thecoveted Florian Wirtz arrived for a club record– and potentially British record – fee. Slot believes the Germany international will bring “a few extra weapons” to the side. Rich in attacking options, Liverpool by contrast appear light in central defence and will require another imperious campaign from Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté. The pair were a formidable unit last season. The defending champions appear the same.How they finished in the past five seasonsThe managerThere is a stark contrast between the character of the Liverpool head coach and the manager he succeeded last summer but, thanks to his tactical brilliance and calm, grounded manner, Slot exceeded expectations in evolving the squad built by Jürgen Klopp. History was made as a result. Slot made the best start by any Liverpool manager with 11 wins in his first 12 games, became the first Dutch coach to win the Premier League and joined the Anfield greats Joe Fagan and Sir Kenny Dalglish in winning the title in his first season. After the tragic events of the summer, the 46-year-old said: “To represent this club in this city now even means more to me and to my wife than it did before.”Off-field pictureIt has been a devastating summer for Liverpool after the deaths of Jota and his brother André Silva in a car accident on 3 July. The Portugal international was one of the most down-to-earth and popular figures in the dressing room, as well as a brilliant finisher who won the Premier League and Nations League in the weeks before his death. The grass verge behind the Main Stand at Anfield became a sea of tributes to the 28-year-old, who married his long-term partner Rute Cardoso, the mother of their three young children, 11 days before the accident. Liverpool have permanently retired Jota’s No 20 shirt in his honour across all levels of the club and have plans for a permanent memorial.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The champions beat off competition from Bayern Munich and Manchester City for the 22-year-old attacking midfielder, who also had interest from Real Madrid. Slot believes Wirtz’s creativity will compensate for Trent Alexander-Arnold’s exit and enable Liverpool to turn dominance in possession into more emphatic victories. Wirtz has looked a class act in pre-season, the former Bayer Leverkusen player’s passing, touch, awareness and ability to find pockets of space in and around the penalty area impressing.View image in fullscreenLiverpool spent a club record £116m to sign Florian Wirtz from Leverkusen.Photograph: Elli Birch/IPS/ShutterstockStepping upWith impeccable timing, the 16-year-old left-winger Rio Ngumoha shone in a pre-season friendly against Yokohama F. Marinos on the day Luis Díaz completed his £65.5m move to Bayern. A fine display capped by an excellent individual goal showed Slot there could be another option to replace the Colombian. Ngumoha repeated the trick in his next outing against Athletic Bilbao. Chelsea were furious when Ngumoha left for Liverpool last summer. The teenager, for his part, felt there was a more straightforward pathway to the first team at Anfield. He will sign his first professional contract when he turns 17 on 29 August.A big season forAlexander-Arnold’s departure creates an opening for Conor Bradley to establish himself as the first-choice right-back. However, any prospect of a straightforward promotion for a 22-year-old who has all the attributes for the job, and the experience of 57 appearances for Liverpool, was curtailed days after the Premier League trophy was lifted. The champions announced the £29.5m signing of Frimpong on the day they accepted a €10m package from Madrid for Alexander-Arnold’s early release. The competition for Bradley remains as fierce as ever, but an opportunity is there to be seized.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26LiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After three hours and nine minutes on court, Raducanu lost 7-6 (3), 4-6, 7-6 (5).Aryna Sabalenka grinds down Emma Raducanu in Cincinnati Open classicRead more“She’s world No 1 for a reason and I pushed her more than I did at Wimbledon so that’s an improvement,” said Raducanu. “And also, it was good to have this result on a hard court because it’s very different to grass. I was always thinking that grass suits me a lot more and I still believe that so to have pushed her on a hard court like that, I’m pretty proud of it.”The 30th seed continued: “I think starting the point is a big takeaway. I think she did that incredibly well in the big moments, she served and returned really well. Me too in certain moments of the match. To hold that level on starting the point in the match is a big thing to me.”After losing the first set, Raducanu recovered brilliantly, serving well for large stretches and then finding a way through an incredible 13-deuce service game at 3-4 in the final set. In the end, Sabalenka showed her mental toughness by saving her best tennis for the most important moments.View image in fullscreenA relieved Aryna Sabalenka celebrates her victory over Emma Raducanu.Photograph: Frey/TPN/Getty Images“You take the lessons from this,” said Raducanu, 22. “I was able to play some good tennis for patches of the match, but I think it also dropped off for other patches of the match. So I think with work and going on the practice court, I can do it for longer and hold the level high for longer. But that being said, we had a three-hour match and I felt pretty good out there for the most part against Aryna who’s achieved everything she has, so it’s mostly positives.”Raducanu’s defeat also marks an end to her first tournament with her new coach Francisco Roig, a former member of Rafael Nadal’s coaching team, who has been working with the Briton since last Tuesday. After her comfortable second-round win against Olga Danilovic, this was their first big match together. Roig was extremely vocal throughout with encouragement and specific tactical advice.“I think the first week went well,” said Raducanu. “I think we practised well. I made some improvements and I think for certain moments, you could see some stuff we practised peek through.

It will also greatly reduce the number of hated back-to-back fixtures.The 18 first-class counties voted through the change in line with the recommendations of the county-led men’s Domestic Playing programme review and in harmony with the wishes of the players’ union, the Professional Cricketers’ Association.The counties will be divided into three regional groups of six – with counties playing each other home and away, plus one home game and one away game against a county outside their group – giving each county an opportunity to play every other on a rolling basis.Attendance figures for the Blast have fallen sharply since a peak of 950,000 tickets sold in 2019, knocked first by Covid and then by the introduction of the Hundred in 2021. The review’s steering group, made up of six county chief executives, plus ECB and PCA representatives, believes that rejigging the fixtures alone will not be enough to reinvigorate the Blast and more innovative moves – such as the introduction of a central investment fund – will be needed.Where there has previously been widespread county opposition to any reduction in the number of lucrative Blast games, the Hundred windfall – non-Hundred-host counties are due to receive just over £24m, host counties £18m – has given the counties more wriggle room.There is not yet any agreement on the future of the County Championship, but the mood music suggests against any drastic change, despite the PCA’s plea that a reduction from 14 to 12 games is “the only reasonable option”. A decision will be made by the counties before the Championship resumes for three final rounds in September.The number of games in the top tier of the Women’s Blast competition will also fall from 14 to 12, as Yorkshire move up to Tier One, with each county playing six home and six away games. The Tier Two teams will come together into one group, playing each other home and away.Explore more on these topicsCricketVitality Blast T20newsShareReuse this content"

The mouthguard will flash red if the impact is severe enough to potentially cause a concussion. The referee will then stop play and the player will go off for a head injury assessment.Lark Atkin-Davies doubles up in Red Roses’ power-packed win over FranceRead moreDr Lindsay Starling, a science and medical manager at World Rugby, said the new system would debut at the Women’s Rugby World Cup, which begins next week, before being rolled out across the men’s and women’s elite game. “Match officials and players will be able to see that this player has sustained a big head impact because their mouth guard is flashing red,” she said. “And it will create awareness about head injuries and concussions in the stands and for fans at home, being able to see it on TV.”Dr Éanna Falvey, the chief medical officer at World Rugby, said every player at the Women’s World Cup would be wearing the new mouthguards, apart from two who wear braces. He said that was significantly higher than for the men’s game, in which around 85% of players wearsmart mouthguards.He said he hoped all players would embrace the new technology. “It would be great for the game. But personal choice is an important thing, autonomy is an important thing.”The mouthguards work by measuring how much a player’s head moves up and down and rotates during a collision. When it registers an acceleration above 75g and 4,500 radians per second squared for men – and 65gs and 4,500 rad/s2 for women – it will start flashing.That is an improvement on the existing system, which uses Bluetooth to alert the match‑day doctor and can take several seconds to arrive.Starling also indicated that the mouthguards could help to identify foul play, but that there were caveats. “There is a world in which the data from the mouthguard can start to come into play a little bit more with foul play,” she said. “But what everybody needs to understand is that in the same way a player can get concussed from a pretty small head impact, foul play [can have occurred] without registering anything substantial.“What we need to be careful not to do is overrely on the data or put too much power in the hands of the data. Data is incredibly powerful, but in this case the data might not tell 100% of the picture.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She indicated that may change over time. “It’s classified as medical data about a player, and so therefore we can’t share those numbers anywhere. But we’re working with the players to get them on board to want to share that information.“There is a very fine line between big and being safe and correct and the player being looked after.

But we don’t actually know which models are being used at the moment.”AI tools are increasingly being used by local authorities to ease the workload of overstretched social workers, although there is little information about which specific AI models are being used, how frequently and what impact this has on decision-making.The LSE research used real case notes from 617 adult social care users, which were inputted into different large language models (LLMs) multiple times, with only the gender swapped.Researchers then analysed 29,616 pairs of summaries to see how male and female cases were treated differently by the AI models.In one example, the Gemma model summarised a set of case notes as: “Mr Smith is an 84-year-old man who lives alone and has a complex medical history, no care package and poor mobility.”The same case notes inputted into the same model, with the gender swapped, summarised the case as: “Mrs Smith is an 84-year-old living alone. Despite her limitations, she is independent and able to maintain her personal care.”In another example, the case summary said Mr Smith was “unable to access the community”, but Mrs Smith was “able to manage her daily activities”.Among the AI models tested, Google’s Gemma created more pronounced gender-based disparities than others. Meta’s Llama 3 model did not use different language based on gender, the research found.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Its researchers tested the first generation of the Gemma model, which is now in its third generation and is expected to perform better, although it has never been stated the model should be used for medical purposes.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)GoogleEnglandAlphabetHealthLocal governmentSocial carenewsShareReuse this content"

The characteristic sound of modems conducting an analog handshake to establish a connection was a preliminary soundtrack to a new world of instant connection, wires, handheld computer mice, emails, chatrooms, instant messages and glowing screens.The dial-up internet wasn’t invented by a single person. It was developed byUsenetin the late 1970s.In 1979, CompuServe began “offering a dial-up online information service to consumers”.By the mid 1980s, with the Well, or the Whole Earth ‘Lectronic Link, launched in the Bay Area by Stewart Brand and Larry Brilliant, virtual communities began to form. At the same time, in 1985, America Online was founded.At its peak in the late 1990s and early 2000s, AOL had over 23 million subscribers in the US, making it the dominant internet service provider at the time.According to Jigso AI, it was estimated to have gained a new user every six seconds.America Online became so dominant – with its equally characteristic but more cheery “You’ve got mail” message – that in 1999 it acquired Time Warner in a massive $165bn all-stock deal that later became regarded as one of the most disastrous deals in media and communications history.By then, the introduction of faster cable internet service in 1995 that relied on existing cable TV infrastructure made the characteristic handshake of dial-up begin to disappear.Currently, only a small fraction of US households – about 175,000 – still rely on dial-up for internet access and web browser platforms. Web browsers themselves could be becoming a relic of the 1990s, when they were subject to fierce wars between Microsoft and Netscape, with the advent of apps. App-based AI has also started to encroach on browsers’ territory.The growth of dial-up internet – sometimes attributed in part to demand for pornography – and its subsequent decline to faster internet services, may now be mourned in concert with other pop cultural relics of decades past, including CDs, pagers and landlines.Explore more on these topicsUS newsAOLInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

AI video generation has surged amid therelease of powerful tools such as Google’s Veo 3and Elon Musk’s Grok Imagine.The channels have millions of subscribers in total, including 1.6 million for the space-stranded infant and 3.9 million forSuper Cat League, which features human-like cats having affairs and, among one of many bizarre scenes, the felines shooting down and dismembering an eagle.Many of these videos qualify as“AI slop”, which refers to low-quality, mass-produced content that is surreal, uncanny or simply grotesque. But some contain a brief, rudimentary plot – in a sign of the growing sophistication of AI-generated content.YouTube has tried to stem the slop deluge byblocking the sharing of advertising revenuewith channels that post repetitive and “inauthentic” content – a policy targeted at AI content.“All content uploaded to YouTube is subject to ourcommunity guidelines– regardless of how it’s generated,” said a spokesperson for YouTube, which is owned by Google’s parent company.After being contacted by the Guardian about the channels – which included channels in the fastest growing list for June – YouTube said it had removed three of them from the platform and blocked a further two from receiving advertising income. It did not specify which channels had been sanctioned.One expert said AI video generators herald the next wave of internet “enshittification”, a term first used by the British-Canadian author Cory Doctorow. Coined in 2022, Doctorow used it to describe the decline in quality of users’ online experiences, as platforms prioritise profit over offering high-quality content.“AI slop is flooding the internet with content that essentially is garbage,” said Dr Akhil Bhardwaj, an associate professor at the University of Bath’s school of management. “Thisenshittificationis ruining online communities on Pinterest, competing for revenue with artists on Spotify and flooding YouTube with poor quality content.”“One way for social media companies to regulate AI slop is to ensure that it cannot be monetised, thus stripping away the incentive for generating it.”Ryan Broderick, the author of the popular Garbage Day newsletter on internet culture, is scathing about the impact of AI video, writing last week that YouTube has become a “dumping ground for disturbing, soulless AI shorts”.Instagram’s Reels video feature is also flooded with AI content.

However, the quid pro quo arrangement, first reported by the Financial Times, is potentially unconstitutional.The arrangement will lead to Nvidia giving 15% of its revenue from Chinese sales of its H20 chips, and AMD giving 15% of revenue from Chinese sales of its MI308 chips, according to reports citing US officials.Trump permits Nvidia to sell advanced chips in China, CEO saysRead moreThe US government has for several years sought to limit supplies of technology to China that could be used in ways that threaten US national security, especially chips that can power artificial intelligence development and weapons.Nvidia’s chips are amajor driver of the AI boom, highly sought-after by both China and the US. Beijing has repeatedly criticised the chip restrictions and accused the US of using tech and trade to “maliciously contain and suppress China”.The H20 and MI308 chips were banned from sale to China in April, despite the lower-powered H20 being designed specifically to abide by restrictions introduced by the Biden administration.However, last month Trump rolled back the bans, and last week the commerce department reportedly started issuing export licences for the H20 – a move that analysts linked to China’s easing of rare earth export restrictions, and to the revenue-sharing agreement revealed on Sunday.In an apparent lobbying effort to address the restrictions, Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, had made visits to Trump andofficials in Beijingin recent months, meeting the US president as recently as Wednesday.Trump has praised Huang and Nvidia, which in July became the first company to haveits market value pass $4tn (£2.97tn), even as it navigated the US-China trade war and other industry turbulence, including Trump’s threatened 100% tariff on foreign semiconductors.In a statement after the Financial Times report, Nvidia said: “We follow rules the US government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. While we haven’t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.”AMD has not commented on the deal.Nvidia’s statement echoed comments by the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, last month, that it was in the US’s interests to have China using American technology, and that the H20 was Nvidia’s “fourth-best chip”. The deal has alarmed analysts, however.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have been replaced once for free byApplewhen they developed a sound issue within the warranty period. Recently, one earbudstopped working. I went to an authorised Apple repairer and was told the price of fixing them was equivalent to buying a new pair of earbuds. This seems wasteful to me as I’d rather repair the broken earbud, and I’m wondering if there is any recourse as to a discounted repair fee to encourage device repairs rather than replacements.– Alana, VictoriaKat George says:Australia has a rapidly growing e-waste problem, so you’re right to challenge tech’s throwaway culture. Australians generated511,000 tonnes of e-waste in 2019, and the Australian government projects that will grow by 30% by 2030.Our NSW council banned street-visible solar panels. What can I do?Read moreFirstly, I question whether you should be the one wearing the cost of a repair or a replacement. Your rights as a consumer extend beyond the warranty offered by a business, in line with the “consumer guarantees” available under the Australian Consumer Law.The consumer guarantees cannot be replaced by product warranties – any warranties provided for a product are in addition to the consumer guarantees.The consumer guarantees require that products are of “acceptable quality and durability”. This includes that the product should be “durable enough to perform its intended function(s) for a reasonable amount of time”. In the case of Beats earbuds, a Google search suggests (anecdotally) that this could be anywhere between three and five years.Unless you’ve used the Beats in a way other than they were intended, for instance, as doorstoppers, or if you’ve done something to damage them, the consumer guarantees apply.Importantly in your case, even though your Beats have already been replaced, theconsumer guarantees apply to the replacementBeats the same way they would to the original product. This means you can expect that the replacement Beats, from the date of replacement, should be of acceptable quality and durability, which it seems they may not be.This entitles you to the full protection of the Australian Consumer Law for the replacement product, and that includes a replacement, a refund or a repair.Rather than going to an authorised repairer, go directly to Apple. CallApple’s customer service, but also put your case to Apple in writing, including the details of your purchase and initial replacement. Let Apple know it is responsible for the faulty product and that you’d like a repair.When I booked flights online I noticed the prices kept changing. Is it legal in Australia? Can I avoid it?Read moreApple could offer to repair the product for you (at no cost to you) or reimburse the cost of the repair. Either way, this should be agreed with Apple in advance of you taking any more steps to facilitate the repair of the Beats yourself.If Apple doesn’t help you with a repair, complain toACCCorConsumer Affairs Victoria. One of these consumer watchdogs should be able to take on your case and communicate with Apple on your behalf to resolve the dispute.Your final recourse is to theVictorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal(VCAT). VCAT is an expensive and time-consuming process, so it may not be worth it for the sake of an earbud, unless you are really set on standing on principle.Ask Kat a questionDo you have an Australian consumer problem you’d like Kat’s advice about?

As a player who previously worked as a bookseller, and currently is a novelist, I am poised to be extremely stressed out by a game set in a mobile bookshop. However, Tiny Bookshop is crafted with such care and balance that I found myself losing hours to the gentle pace and tiny puzzles and sheer escapism of the world it presents.The setup is simple, and one that is common to many games in the post Stardew Valley era of“cosy” games. You throw in your old life and open a shop selling tiny things you are passionate about to a bustling little community full of interesting characters who you progressively develop relationships with by providing them with goods and services. Days, weeks and seasons pass, the world grows richer and more interesting around you, the stakes rise and fall, a tiny economy evolves from your business.View image in fullscreenA lush, lived-in community … Tiny Bookshop.Photograph: Neoludic GamesHowever, what is different this time is that you are not selling farmed goods as in Stardew Valley, or tea as in Spirittea orWanderstop, or, in the case of Spiritfarer, shepherding dying souls to the other side via your floating bed and breakfast. You’re selling books. Actual books. From Wilde and Shakespeare and Woolf and Agatha Christie all the way through to Toni Morrison and John Green and Holly Black, you are providing the inhabitants of a sleepy seaside and university town with books that are recognisable and real. Every book that you stock in your little trailer shop is, to my knowledge, a real one.Now, this will place some players at an advantage – if you’re a reader, selling books to people will come easily. You won’t need to study the flavour text to compare books the customers like with books you have in stock: if they’re looking for something scary, romantic, and historical, Carmilla ticks all the boxes. You’ll know what graphic novels feel a little heady, or which ones are for a more casual reader.This feels to me like a rare game made with readers in mind: the puzzle of finding which books suit which customer’s request comes quite quickly, even if the in-game algorithm sometimes didn’t match my personal taste. I think The Great Gatsby would appeal to a customer looking for philosophical fiction, but the game doesn’t. Like working in an actual bookshop, there are genres and categories that serve a watertight function; unlike working in a bookshop, personal taste doesn’t come into it. However, Tiny Bookshop is adept at teaching you its rules, and recommending the wrong title doesn’t come at a high cost. The stakes aren’t too steep. There is no real way to lose.Cosy video games are on an unstoppable rise. Will they unleash a darker side?Read moreI played using the touchscreen on my Steam Deck, which I found deeply pleasing and responsive compared to using the buttons, which were a little tricky. Decorating my tiny bookshop was great: discovering I could acquire a shop dog was a real joy. The local characters are quite a serious bunch and hold some old dramas and pathos – there is a sense of a lush, lived-in community unravelling secrets and context as the seasons pass by. It is the first new game I’ve found myself truly relaxing into in quite some time: the gameplay is rhythmic and mellow, and, dare I say it, genuinely cosy.

On a matter also fundamental to its own security, Europe must assert itselfMon 11 Aug 2025 13.46 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 16.49 EDTShareIn recent weeks, as Russia continued its assault on Ukraine in frank disregard of White House deadlines and demands, there was hope in Kyiv and European capitals that the scales might finally be falling from Donald Trump’s eyes. Last month, Mr Trumpnotedthat although his conversations with Vladimir Putin repeatedly led him to believe that a ceasefire deal was in reach, the Russian president then routinely went on to “knock down a building in Kyiv”. More bluntly, he hasaccusedMr Putin of stringing him along with “bullshit”.It was ostensibly on those grounds that the US president set an 8 Augustdeadlinefor Mr Putin to agree to a peace deal with Ukraine, on pain of “significant” sanctions. Yet instead of being punished for ignoring this injunction too, Mr Putin has been rewarded with asummitwith Mr Trump in the United States, and apparently allowed to veto any suggestion that Volodymyr Zelenskyy should also attend.Suddenly, and alarmingly, it feels a little like February again, when Mr Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance,treatedMr Zelenskyy with outrageous disrespect in the White House, and appeared disposed to pursuing a peace agreement on Mr Putin’s terms. There are conflicting accounts ofdiscussionsbetween Mr Putin and the US presidential envoy, Steve Witkoff, last week. But there is no evidence that Mr Putin has any intention of compromising on his maximalist goals in Ukraine, including the annexation of eastern regions, demilitarisation and the abandoning of Ukraine’s aspiration to Nato membership.Morally and practically speaking, the Ukrainian president’s absence on Friday will mean that any “deal” struck by Mr Trump and Mr Putin in Alaska lacks all legitimacy. But Kyiv understandably fears a carve-up in whichUkraineis pressured by Washington and Moscow to unilaterally surrender land in its east, and make other concessions, in exchange for a pause in the fighting.This would be, of course, to reward Mr Putin’s illegal invasion and betray a nation whose fate is tied up with Europe’s security as a whole. The very fact of Friday’s summit, from which European leaders are also excluded, is already a wholly unearned diplomatic win for Mr Putin. Mr Trump is driven by mercantilism and ego: he may be persuaded that if Ukraine could be bullied into accepting the unacceptable,opportunitiesrelating to Russian oil and gas could be unleashed, and the Nobel peace prize he covets become a genuine possibility.After frantic mediation, it emerged on Monday that Mr Zelenskyy and European leaders may take part in a joint call with Mr Trump on Wednesday. The Ukrainian president hasalreadymade it clear that there will be no concession of further territory to Russia’s occupying forces. In the lead-up to Alaska, and afterwards, Europe must ensure that his words are lent weight by a unified and robust stance on what would constitute a just peace, as opposed to one imposed against Ukraine’s will.Ultimately, that will need to include credible security guarantees for Kyiv fromEuropeand the US, and an agreed sanctions regime to be enacted should Russia renege on its commitments. But the first priority must be pressuring Mr Putin to agree to a ceasefire immediately in order that meaningful negotiations can begin. Until last week, that appeared to be the approach Mr Trump had decided to adopt. It was the right one.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This will cost ordinary Americans greatlySteven GreenhouseTrump’s trade war has pushed up inflation, slashed US job gains, slowed economic growth and caused the manufacturing sector to sputterMon 11 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 12.45 EDTShareThe ever-bombastic Donald Trump has boasted repeatedly of his trade victories, while White House news releases trumpet his “historic trade wins”. The Wall Street Journal echoed Trump’s triumphalism with a headline saying, “Trump is Winning His Trade War”, and last week the New York Times used theexact same wordsin a headline. That must have been music to the president’s ears.Forgive me for being a spoilsport, but I don’t see where the victory is or how Trump is winning. I keep reading how Trump’s trade war and tariff machinations have pushed up inflation,slashed US job gains,slowedeconomic growthand caused themanufacturing sector to sputter.The rate of job growth plunged by over 70% in the three months after Trump unveiled his 2 April “liberation day” tariffs that filled corporate executives with uncertainty and dread. Trump is palpably impatient for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but the higher prices resulting from his tariffs are likely to delay the rate cuts he desperately wants. So can someone please tell me where is the victory here?Trump further proclaims that his tariffs are wondrous because, he says, they will generatetrillions of dollars in revenuefor the US Treasury. But those revenues will come out of the hides of tens of millions of American consumers who will pay Trump’s taxes on imports. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that the price increases caused by Trump’s tariffs will cost the typical US household$2,400 in 2025. As a result of the tariffs, the budget lab says,apparel prices will soar 37%and shoe prices 39%. What Trump boasts as a win is a loss for millions of typical Americans.Some economists are warning that Trump’s tariffs will bring back stagflation, a dangerous combination of rising prices and slowing growth last seen in the 1970s. Pointing to signs of stagflation,BMO Economics wrote: “Economic activity and job growth aresputtering under the weight of higher tariffs, increasing inflation and rising economic policy and trade uncertainty.” Doesn’t look as if Trump’s trade war is winning there.Trump recently said on CNBC’s Squawk Box that “people love the tariffs”, but evidently the people he’s talking about aren’t the American people. A recent Fox News poll of registered voters found that Americansoverwhelming disapproveof Trump’s tariff policies by 62% to 36%. Ben May, a forecaster at Oxford Economics, said his tariffs willhurt US familiesbecause “they are obviously raising prices … and squeezing household incomes”.Many days it seems that Trump tries to dominate the news cycle with some tariff announcement or other: 50% on Brazil, double India’s tariffs to 50%, impose a 100% tariff on semiconductors. (Even some Maga folks probably think he uses tariff announcements to distract from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.) This week the White House dismayed the world by announcing that Trump would impose tariffs, ranging from 15% to 50%, on 90 countries effective Thursday. As a result of Trump’s tariff craze, the average effective tariff rate on imports into the US will be 18%, up from 2.3% last year – the highest level since the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930 worsened the Great Depression.Remember when Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro predicted last Apil that the administration would negotiate90 deals in 90 days. That didn’t come close to happening. But Trump did pressure the EU, Japan and South Korea into reluctantly accepting trade deals that call for tariffs of 15% – a compromise down from the 25% and 30% levels Trump had been demanding. Even though the EU, Japan and South Korea have long been among America’s closest allies, Trump used nasty threats to get them to accept those tariffs, which will hurt those countries’ manufacturers, while also hurting US consumers.Here’s one way to look at Trump’s strong-arm tactics: When a bully demands that a person do something that that person doesn’t want to do and that something will hurt not just that person, but also the bully’s family – and probably the bully, too, long-term – how is that winning, rather than bull-headed destructiveness? Some headline writers might lazily conclude that Trump is winning his trade war (a war of headstrong destructiveness), but in that war, everyone and everything, except Trump’s limitless ego and a handful of US industries, are losers.There are many other reasons Trump’s trade deals shouldn’t be viewed as victories. Trump’s main motivation for tariffs is arguably to increase manufacturing in the US, but factory activity has actuallydeclined in recent months, according to the Institute for Supply Management.Harley-Davidson says it has reducedproduction because of tariff-induced uncertainty and higher expenses. Ford, which assembles more cars in the US than any other automaker, complains that Trump’s tariff mess caused its profits tofall by $800min the second quarter. Trumps’s mishmash of tariffs, including steep import taxes on steel, aluminum and auto parts, have made Ford’s production more problematic and expensive.Trump’s trade war has pushed relations with many countries to their worst point in decades. Acting more like a mob boss than a dealmaker, Trump has told various nations that if they promise to cough up several hundred billion dollars in investment in the US, he’ll make nice and lower their tariff rate. Or else. One economist called this “a global shakedown”. Many officials in Europe, Asia, Latin America and Canada are no doubt seething. Trump seems to treat Washington’s trading partners as punching bags—that’s not a winning strategy for the US or the world.Another motivation behind Trump’s tariffs is his desire to erase the huge US trade deficit. That deficit has certainly been a problem, helping lead to myriad factory closings and job losses across blue-collar America. But even with that its record trade deficits, the US has, by many measures, the world’s richest, most successful economy.Trump boasts that his tariffs are already bringing back some manufacturing—and there’s no denying that there are several examples, Last Wednesday,Apple vowed to invest$100bn in advanced manufacturing in the US, and GM plans to increase production of itsChevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierratrucks in Indiana while trimming output in Canada.Nonetheless, there’s a huge question mark as to whether Trump’s tariffs will inspire a major manufacturing rebound in the US. Many experts say the 15% tariffs imposed on the EU, Japan and other places are too low to persuade companies to move production to the US. For corporations to build a new $500m factory in the US, they will want solid assurances of what economic conditions will be four and five years from now. But does anyone actually think that the mercurial Mr Trump won’t issue new tariff threats or order tariff changes within four or five weeks?Perhaps the newspaper headline should be, “Trump Has Already Lost a Pivotal Part of His Trade War.” All the months of Trump’s on-again, off-again, up-and-down tariffs may mean he has so spooked and alienated corporate planners that he will never achieve his goal of bringing back far more factories, notwithstanding other countries’ often-vague pledges of billions in investmentsEven beyond that, in this age of AI, algorithms and a thriving service economy, it seems that Trump’s trade war – with the tremendous pain and disruption it is causing – might have made far more sense to help the economy of 50 or 75 years ago than the AI and information economy of today.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

But on one point – the Palestinians’ rejection of two states – they’ve been more-or-less correct. For me, and many others, the fundamental injustice of the establishment of the state ofIsrael– which occurred through massive, deliberate and purposeful ethnic cleansing designed to create a Jewish majority in historic Palestine – meant that Israel never really attained moral legitimacy among Palestinians. As Robert Malley and Hussein Agha write in their new book, Tomorrow Is Yesterday: “deep down, most Palestinians, though ready to accept Israel’s existence, have not accepted its historical legitimacy”, a statement whose veracity I can attest to.I remember being a 15-year-old in Palestine. I remember being held up at checkpoints in the West Bank, and being unable to visit Jerusalem or Israel because of the color of my ID card, in effect, because of my race. I could see how unjust, how retrograde, the entire basis of Israel was. No amount of German or western guilt over the Holocaust would make me accept the idea that Jewish supremacy in Palestine was somehow desirable, or just. I think that continues to be true for the overwhelming majority of Palestinians. Possibly, for the overwhelming majority of humanity in the post-colonial global south.That’s not to say that the political process – which commenced in Madrid and Oslo –wasn’t undertaken in good faith by sincere and earnest people. I know some of the negotiators on the Palestinian side, like Diana Buttu, a principled advocate for Palestinian rights for decades now. Daniel Levy, who negotiated for the Israelis, has been an outspoken opponent of Israeli apartheid and the genocide inGaza, and a formidable critic of the peace process in the past 20 years.At its height in 1995, the Oslo process, which was supposed to produce a Palestinian state, but more importantly, an end to claims, commanded the support of two-thirds of Palestinians. Many of them, like my parents, were prepared to close a chapter on history, to swallow their grievances so that their children might live. Similarly, the Palestinian negotiators I’ve met in the past two decades each understood the basic deficit of justice, the imbalance in the ledger, but they sought to abort a conflict which has ravenously claimed the future at every turn.In many cases their intentions were honorable.And yet, the failure of the peace process was preordained, readily apprehensible to anyone who lived in the Occupied Territories in the 1990s, when the settlements truly metastasized. It should have been obvious to anyone with a map and a history book, too. That’s because Zionism, Israel’s animating ideology, adheres to classically European colonialism, which continues to be the best framework for understanding Palestine/Israel. Writing in October 2003 in the New York Review of Books, the moral thinker and historian Tony Judt described Israel as “an anachronism”, essentially a throwback to the Belgian Congo or 18th-century Australia. Israel’s extermination of native life in Gaza is anachronistic, too. It rhymes, in the worst way.There were glaring structural reasons for Oslo’s failure as well. The fact that many of the American negotiators were Zionists was underreported, and underappreciated. Dennis Ross, who led the American team, is a Zionist, indistinguishable to my eyes from Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak, two former Israeli prime ministers. Bill Clinton, who was president at the time, recently referred to “Judea and Samaria”, coded Zionist language for the occupied West Bank. In effect, Oslo pitted a stateless people against two nuclear-armed states led by people who were fundamentally invested in Jewish supremacy in Palestine.Emmanuel Macron’s decision to recognize a Palestinian state in September amounts to little, as Donald Trump noted. I do not know Macron’s intentions, but the Palestinians have never really warmed to European and American condescension, which is implicit in every conditional statement, every contingent incrementalism. Mark Carney’s strange, confused statement that Canada would only accept a “Zionist Palestinian state” is grimly entertaining for anyone with a basic grasp of the issues. Anyone who isn’t a dilettante, in other words.Now, in the midst of a genocide, the Palestinians are best served by abandoning any effort to attain self-rule in the Occupied Territories. A reorientation towards basic rights is overdue, along with recognition the Palestinian struggle was never really about a seat at the United Nations, representation in Unesco, or Fifa. The force of the Palestinian cause rests in one principle: justice.Two years ago I thought justice meant a single state with equal rights between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. But now, the Palestinians are confronted by a difficulty: no one is able to articulate what justice means in the wake of so much slaughter, of so many dead men, women and children, dead babies. The genocide has changed my perspective on the majority of Jewish Israelis, and once they retire their guns and mortars – as one day they surely will – we will have to reckon with the moral, and actual, wreckage of their century-longSturm und Drang,their violent ejaculations, in Palestine.Ahmed Moor is a writer and fellow at the Foundation for Middle East PeaceExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionPalestinian territoriesGazacommentShareReuse this content"

Alongside his numerous policy failures, oneCornell University studyfound that he was the biggest source of Covid-19 misinformation. But if there’s one redeeming feature to Trump’s pandemic record, it has to be his leadership on Operation Warp Speed – a massive, government-funded initiative that played a pivotal role in fast-tracking Covid-19 vaccines.“Operation Warp Speed stands as one of the most remarkable scientific and humanitarian achievements of the past half-century,”the former US surgeon general Jerome Adamssaid. It directed billions of dollars into vaccine development and manufacturing, particularly into the mRNA platform, which became the backbone of the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.Vaccines work by preparing the body’s immune system to identify and successfully attack foreign agents entering the body. Traditional vaccines use weakened or inactivated viruses to offer a baby version for the body to fight and learn from. These vaccines are often produced by growing the virus in hen’s eggs, which means production is slow and can take months to scale up. In contrast, the mRNA platform functions like a plug-and-play video game console: you just “plug in” the genetic code of a particular virus or pathogen. The vaccineprovides instructionsto our bodies to make parts of the virus in our own cells, which then prompts an immune response.The process of creating and manufacturing these vaccines is much faster and more flexible than their traditional counterparts. This is especially important for a disease such as avian flu, which has an up to 100% mortality rate in chickens. But despite the speed in which they come together, there is still a considerable time-lag before mass rollout to allow for clinical trials to ensure human safety, test for side-effects and figure out optimal dosing. During the Covid pandemic, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were created within weeks of research teams receiving the genetic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from China in January 2020. What took a year was the testing and regulatory approval processes to ensure there was trust in their safety.Given Trump’s success with Operation Warp Speed, it’s particularly bizarre that Robert F Kennedy Jr, his health and human services secretary, has announced$500m in cutsto the mRNA vaccine investment portfolio. These include cancelling funding for Moderna’s development into a late-stage H5N1 avian flu vaccine. I asked Prof Rebecca Katz, a global health security expert and former US State Department adviser, for her assessment of the damage. She called it: “A self-inflicted wound to a vital organ.”On its own, RFK Jr’s decisionisn’t surprising, considering his longstanding anti-vax advocacy and cult-like following. He has built a whole identity on anti-science rhetoric and he is especially vocal about the supposed dangers of mRNA technology. But being an anti-vaxxer is also a tricky road to navigate:RFK Jr upset his basewhen, under considerable political pressure, he finally endorsed MMR vaccinations during the Texas measles outbreak.But putting one personality aside, what do these cuts mean for the health of people living in the US and the wider world? It’s bad news. Take the example ofH5N1 avian flu. This virus has shown concerning step-changes including becoming endemic in wild birds, infecting a number of poultry farms, and now has sufficient mutations to enable cow-to-cow (mammal to mammal) transmission in the US among dairy cattle. With its circulation in certain herds of dairy cattle has come a rise in human infections (cow-to-human). The virus is nowone mutation awayfrom easier transmission among humans. That’s the nightmare scenario: an influenza pandemic, possibly more lethal than Covid-19.If a human-to-human transmissible H5N1 strain appears, the existing mRNA infrastructure could be used to rapidly develop a targeted vaccine. Many countries, including the UK, have been stockpiling vaccine components or ramping up surveillance. Under the Biden administration, the US had been among the leaders in this effort. By shelving investment and halting further development, the US is essentially gambling that we won’t need quick medical countermeasures. It’s a dangerous bet. When the next pandemic happens, the cost in human lives could be much higher than we witnessed in 2020.Can other countries simply pick up the slack with mRNA production? Not easily. After the Covid pandemic led to huge disparities in which places in the world had access to vaccine supply, many countries starting planning for their own vaccine and mRNA hubs. They didn’t want to be dependent on the charity of the US or UK to donate them doses: they wanted to independently respond effectively. On aNational Academies projectthat I was vice-chair of on the global coordination of vaccines for pandemic influenza, we looked closely into regional production, including in Africa. What I learned from experts across the world is thatvaccine production, especially mRNA-based vaccines, requires a high degree of technical expertise, quality control and highly specialised supply chains. It will happen in other places, but not quickly enough to shoulder the impact of the US decision.Unlike foreign aid cuts, where the effect is felt immediately in the shutting down of food programmes or health clinics, cuts to research funding have a slower, deeper impact, especially in terms of expertise and knowledge generation. Research programmes that were working on pandemic preparedness are closing. Postdoctoral researchers aren’t finding jobs, without the necessary soft money to support them. PhD programmes have been frozen or cancelled. Universities, highly dependent on government funding, are scaling back their research activities in health, especially in areas that money is being cut from. Perhaps most devastating of all: smart, ambitious young scientists have fewer opportunities to develop careers in public health research and vaccine development. They’ll look elsewhere – into AI, tech, finance. Where will the expertise come from in the next 15 to 20 years if the career pipeline is being shut down?RFK Jr may position himself as Making America Healthy Again, but in reality, his policies make the entire world more vulnerable. He may, in fact, be the most dangerous person in theTrump administration– not because he’s loud or erratic, but because he’s steadily eroding the foundation of public health research and infrastructure. This isn’t just bad policy. It’s a generational setback. In that light, RFK Jr stands not merely as a controversial figure but as a serious risk to national and global health security.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghExplore more on these topicsVaccines and immunisationOpinionHealthRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationMedical researchcommentShareReuse this content"

With the arrest of hundreds of protesters in London, for many, the feeling is mutualMon 11 Aug 2025 11.50 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 15.17 EDTShareIn the third month of this tense, parched summer, the British state is under severe strain. Stripped of resources by 14 years of reckless rightwing government, contorting itself to maintain relations with ever more extreme regimes abroad, expanding its security powers at home through ever more tortured logic, regarded by ever more voters with contempt, a once broadly respected institution is increasingly struggling to maintain its authority.You could see the strain on the faces of some of the police officers, reddening with exertion in the sun, asthey arrested 521 peoplein Parliament Square on Saturday for displaying pieces of paper or cardboard with a seven-word message supporting the proscribed group Palestine Action. It was one of the biggest mass arrests in London’s history.The many protesters who refused to be led away had to be lifted off the ground, one by one, without the exercise looking too coercive in front of the cameras. Then their floppy, uncooperative forms had to be carried by clusters of officers through the hostile crowd – to chants of “genocide police!”, “shame on you!” and “fascist scum!” – to a ring of police vans at the square’s perimeter, which were then sometimes obstructed by further protesters, before they eventually drove away.So many officers were needed that some had come from Wales. When Tony Blair’sLabourgovernment introduced Welsh devolution 26 years ago, in times of more harmony and less scarcity, cooperation between the nations was probably not envisaged in this form.On Saturday, so that the capital’s police custody system was not overwhelmed, those arrested were taken to “makeshift outdoor processing centres”, the Observer reported – as if during a general breakdown of law and order. Some of those released on bail then reportedly went back to the protest. “Given the numbers of people arrested,” said the Metropolitan police, “it would have been entirely unrealistic for officers to recognise individuals who returned to [the square].” “Entirely unrealistic” is not a reassuring phrase for those who believe that the government’s approach to Palestine Action is practical and based on sound law.If charged, those arrested will enter the overburdened criminal justice system and then, if found guilty, Britain’s bursting jails. It’s likely that further supporters of Palestine Action will follow. The organiser of Saturday’s protest, Defend Our Juries,has promiseda sustained campaign of “mass, public defiance”, to make the proscription of Palestine Action “unworkable”.This amendment to the 2000 Terrorism Act – a less benign legacy of Blair than devolution – states that anyone who “wears, carries or displays an article” publicly, “in such a way… as to arouse reasonable suspicion that he is a member or supporter of” Palestine Action could be jailed for up to six months; and anyone who “invites support for” the organisation could be jailed for up to 14 years.One woman sat on a camping stool, wearing a panama hat. She told me: ‘I don’t like the Guardian, I read the Telegraph.’Authoritarianism and austerity have risen together in Britain, as the relatively generous public spending of the Blair years has receded and new waves of radical activism have formed over the climate crisis and the destruction of Palestine. Yet the possibility that austerity will make authoritarianism unaffordable, with too much of the government’s funds swallowed up by the security state, does not seem prominent in Labour’s thinking. The fact that Keir Starmer is a former director of public prosecutions and that the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has for many years been one of parliament’s leading authorities on national security, has given them a lot of faith in law-and-order solutions to political problems.The Parliament Square protesters took a different view. They had been advised by Defend Our Juries not to give quotes to journalists, to avoid distracting from the protest’s focus on the Palestine Action proscription and the genocide in Gaza. Yet the dozen protesters I spoke to informally all talked about Britain’s police and politicians without the slightest deference, as part of a system that was failing, practically and ethically, to address our era’s escalating crises.As the arrests went on and on, through the hot afternoon and into the evening, many of the protesters barely moved, but kept facing the same way, sitting on the ground with their placards carefully displayed and their backs to the Houses of Parliament. Partly, this was to provide a globally resonant image, but it was also to dramatise their rejection of the will of the Commons, where only 26 MPs voted against Palestine Action’s proscription last month. Parliament likes to see itself as a historic defender of freedom and liberty, yet when panics about subversive groups are under way, its liberalism often evaporates.While the Commons narrows its views in times of crisis, the electorate sometimes does the opposite. Half of those arrested in the square were aged 60 or older – usually the most politically conservative demographic. Many had had middle-class careers in public service. Chatting among themselves on the grass in the quieter moments between police surges, they could almost have been taking a break between events at a book festival. One woman sat on a camping stool, wearing a panama hat. When I introduced myself, she said: “I don’t like the Guardian, I read the Telegraph.”The last time Labour was in office, opposition to its more draconian and militaristic policies also emerged across the political spectrum. The more rightwing members of this opposition can be questioned: are they as outraged when Tory governments support wars or suspend civil liberties? My sense is not.But either way, broad opposition erodes a government’s legitimacy. At the 2005 election, after the Terrorism Act and the Iraq war, Blair still won, yet with almost a third fewer votes than when he came to power. With Labour more unpopular now, Starmer can less afford to alienate anti-war voters – much as his most illiberal subordinates might want to.Yet any electoral consequences from the scenes in Parliament Square, and from likely sequels, are hardly the only things at stake in the Palestine Action controversy. At mid-afternoon on Saturday, with the police cordon tightening around us, I got talking to two elderly protesters who had watched people being arrested beside them. “I’m in two minds about carrying on with this,” one of them said, opening and closing her piece of cardboard with its illegal message. Defiant earlier, she now seemed frightened. The legally safe space for protest in Britain is shrinking again. Meanwhile in Gaza, there’s no safe space for anything at all.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Australia is blessed with some of the best solar and wind resources with world-best availability factors, and comparatively little of this is needed domestically.Fortescue axes two green hydrogen projects after Trump administration’s shift on renewablesRead moreThese significant resources can be used to make energy-intensive exports. The key point to understand is that in the fossil fuel world it is low cost to transport, for example, our iron ore, coking coal, gas and thermal coal to north-east Asia where they are used to make iron and steel.In the net zero world, however, it is extremely expensive to export the renewable energy and the hydrogen to replace coking coal, which are needed to make green iron. So green iron should be made where the renewable resources are and where the hydrogen is made – in Australia. The change in transport costs flips the economics so that it is logical that more value adding occurs in Australia.What are the benefits?The benefits for Australia and the world are enormous. Significant investment is required, many skilled workers are needed, and our productivity will be boosted as the technology and learning-by-doing sees continuing improvement in making these products.The world benefits as well because if we realise our green energy-intensive export potential, Australia can produce products that will reduce world emissions by up to 10%. Countries that do not have the renewable resources to decarbonise themselves will rely on Australia playing its role, just as we have by being the world’s largest exporter of coal and gas combined.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWhat are the downsides?The only downside is that we do not know how quickly countries will meet their international commitments and decarbonise. The faster they do, the larger the opportunity for Australia.How practical is it?Australia as an energy-intensive green export superpower is extremely practical. Indeed, its time has come. Continually talking about the superpower opportunity without projects emerging encourages scepticism and sees other countries gain an advantage over us that they should not have. Other countries are starting projects and gaining the learning-by-doing lessons we should be benefiting from.Global consortium led by Australia’s BlueScope weighs takeover of embattled Whyalla steelworksRead moreWhat is needed is for the government to support early projects with 15% to 30% innovation capital grants and to provide initial support to make up for the lack of a world carbon price. If you believe in the climate science that fossil fuel use damages our environment, it is ridiculous that products that do not damage the environment are competing with those that do without the latter paying for the damage they cause.While not a necessary component of this big idea, this could all be paid for, with considerable money left over, if Australia introduced a carbon price. This would see Australia decarbonise in an easier and much less costly way than we are now.How politically risky is it?There are minimal political risks apart from where the government obtains the small amount of money to fund this. The funding is small as only the first few projects will qualify for the innovation grants, and Australia’s green energy intensive exports, once we have made a start, can respond to overseas carbon pricing, as will soon apply in Europe with the introduction of its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, and as is emerging in other countries directly or via increasing green product mandates which have the same effect.Whereas decarbonising Australia involves some politically difficult decisions, what is not to like about Australia value adding more in Australia, with new jobs outside our cities, and a continuing boost to productivity and prosperity?The only downside is talking about it but not taking the steps to bring it about.Rod Sims is the chair of theSuperpower Institute.

But Allah’s will came first, and His decree is final.I have lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification – so that Allah may bear witness against those who stayed silent, those who accepted our killing, those who choked our breath, and whose hearts were unmoved by the scattered remains of our children and women, doing nothing to stop the massacre that our people have faced for more than a year and a half.View image in fullscreenAnas al-Sharif with his daughter, Sham, and son, Salah.Photograph: FacebookI entrust you with Palestine – the jewel in the crown of the Muslim world, the heartbeat of every free person in this world.

I pray that Allah grants her strength and rewards her on my behalf with the best of rewards.I also entrust you with my lifelong companion, my beloved wife, Umm Salah (Bayan), from whom the war separated me for many long days and months. Yet she remained faithful to our bond, steadfast as the trunk of an olive tree that does not bend – patient, trusting in Allah, and carrying the responsibility in my absence with all her strength and faith. I urge you to stand by them, to be their support after Allah Almighty.If I die, I die steadfast upon my principles. I testify before Allah that I am content with His decree, certain of meeting Him, and assured that what is with Allah is better and everlasting. O Allah, accept me among the martyrs, forgive my past and future sins, and make my blood a light that illuminates the path of freedom for my people and my family.

And imagine what such ambition could do for the fortunes of Birmingham, Manchester or LeedsMon 11 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 12.01 EDTShareAnother week, another piece of good news concerning London’s newest railway. This time it’s a timetable update showing that the Saturday service on the core section ofthe Elizabeth line will increasefrom 16 to 20 trains an hour. From December, there will be a train every three minutes between Paddington and Whitechapel, higher than the normal off-peak frequency, just in time for your Christmas shopping. OK, it’s hardly world peace or a custodial sentence for the people who keep adding AI to search engines, but in 2025 you take what you can get.There are two competing narratives about what, in happier times, we used to know asCrossrail. The first and most familiar is a litany of complaints. The new line took for ever to happen, even by the standards of such things: an east-west heavy rail tunnel linking Paddington and Liverpool Street was first proposed mere weeks after the conclusion of the blitz, and as far back as the 1990s information leaflets about the plan were appearing at outer London stations and exciting some of the cooler local teenagers. But the route didn’t actually get the nod until 2008, at almost exactly the point someone in the offices of Lehman Brothers was asking: “So, when you saysub-prime …”And then, of course, it arrived late and over budget. This is par for the course with infrastructure “megaprojects”, which have a well-known habit of costing billions more than projected – but the insulting thing about this one was that,as late as the summer of 2018, its promoters were still touting it as the exception to the rule. On the last day of August that year, though, about four months before opening day, news broke that it would not be delivered on time. In retrospect, the fact the stations were visibly unfinished should have been a useful clue. In the end, the £4bn budget overrun – on a single London project – was bigger in itself than the sum Rachel Reeves put aside for transport in any single city region in 2025.Less expensive but more irritating was the line’s new name.Londonhas a habit of doing this – the only tube lines built since the network effectively entered public ownership in 1933, the Victoria and the Jubilee, were named for the royals, too. Nonetheless, it felt deeply weird to do this while Queen Elizabeth II was still alive.And so, by the time the line opened in 2022, the shine had come off. But that’s when the narrative began to change – because, while there have been teething problems (mostly involving signalling, mainly in west London), it’s become increasingly obvious that the line has been an enormous success. By its third anniversary in May, it had provided more than half a billion journeys, more than any other operator in that period, including the entirety of the South Western Railway or Northern Trains networks – this, remember, for what is in essence a big tube line. It is also responsible for astaggering one in seven journeyson the entire British rail network. TfL reckons almost 30% of these are people who’d previously have travelled by car or not at all.More than that, the line has transformed the geography of London. It has halved journey times from parts of south-east London to the West End, put Paddington and points west in easy reach of the eastern suburbs and provided passengers at Heathrow with a single fast train to essentially everywhere. Even the ExCel exhibition centre in the Royal Docks is no longer hell to reach (merely to enter). Suburbs have been regenerated,more jobs created, more houses built; the line’s forelock-tugging name has ceased to sound weird. It’s hard to argue it was not worth the wait.All of which raises an obvious question: if it worked this well, why on earth are we not building more of it? As things stand, at least six trains an hour – a service frequency passengers in much of London, let alone elsewhere, would kill for – go no farther west than Paddington. Doesn’t that suggest a case for an extension? Or what about the abandoned plan to extend the Canary Wharf branch to Ebbsfleet in Kent? Or for Crossrail 2, the latest iteration of the nearly-as-long-discussed Chelsea-Hackney route? Or for extending the Bakerloo line to Lewisham?The biggest prizes, though, are surely not even in London. One of the big constraints on the West Midlands rail networks is the shortage of space at Birmingham New Street station. A Birmingham Crossrail, allowing suburban trains to travel from east or west, could enable higher frequencies by getting local trains out of the way of intercity ones, and revolutionise transport in a city still far too dependent on cars.Then there’s the M62 corridor, where four city regions with a combined population nearing London’s abut. The region’s terrible transport links are not the only reason productivity in Manchester or Leeds lags their continental peers – but the fact commuters can’t rely on trains turning up on time or at all when deciding where to work surely can’t be helping. And yet governments have repeatedly refused to back the new line – branded variously as Northern Powerhouse Rail, High Speed 3 or Crossrail for the North – meant to address this. Even less ambitious schemes – new through platforms at Manchester Piccadilly, electrification to bring the region at last into the late 20th century – have been loudly promised then quietly abandoned.Reeves has promised £3.5bnto fund upgrades on the existing TransPennine route – but given that a new Manchester-Leeds route was projected to cost £5bn when proposed over a decade ago, it is hard to see how this the extra cash could provide anything even close to the transformative new line that London is now enjoying.The reason, of course, is that the Treasury sees rail infrastructure not as investment but as a new cost centre. (Road maintenance, for some reason, never gets the same treatment.) In direct contrast to the bit of the rail network run by TfL, indeed, stealth nationalisation on the rest of the network has been accompanied by service cuts.This is absurd. Experience suggests that, if you build it, they will come, and jobs and homes will follow. Someone should take the Treasury on the Elizabeth line.Jonn Elledge is an author and former assistant editor of the New StatesmanExplore more on these topicsRail transportOpinionRail industryTransportCrossrailLondonEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

This outrageous landgrab is ethnic cleansing in plain sightMon 11 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 03.24 EDTShareIt is hard to describe in words the pain of witnessing your people being destroyed for more than 670 days. It is even more unfathomable to contemplateanother Israeli escalation, after witnessing so much suffering and so many crimes committed against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip. How can this be allowed in full view of the world for so long? Will the world stand by?Israel’s security cabinet declared this escalation when it approved a plan to “fully occupy” the Gaza Strip and attack concentrations of population, starting with Gaza City itself. The consequences of this newest military onslaught are foreseeable and predictable. InMay 2024, Israel attacked Rafahdespite international warnings and in defiance of an international court of justice order – Rafah no longer exists. In November and December 2024, Israelattackedthe northern towns of Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya, and destroyed them in a campaign that former minister of defence Moshe Ya’alondescribed as “ethnic cleansing”. More recently, Israel unilaterally violated the ceasefire agreement, imposed starvation on the 2 million survivors anddestroyed the southern city of Khan Younis.All these actions are in violation of the three rulings on genocide by the international court of justice (ICJ) in January, March and May 2024. The ICJ identified a risk of genocide in January 2024 and stipulated measures thatIsraelneeded to follow to prevent the committing of genocide, including the unlimited provision of humanitarian aid. By all accounts, Israel has been violating these measures. An attack on Gaza City will be the latest phase of Israel’s genocidal campaign in Gaza.Immediately after 7 October, Israeli leaders, politicians, commanders and soldiers repeatedly said that they woulddestroy, burn and flatten Gaza. And they proceeded to do just that:Israel has effectively destroyed 90% of the Gaza Strip, turned it into a wasteland, andcrammed the population into 12% of the territory, throwing them into dire humanitarian conditions that are unfit for human survival. By besieging and bombarding the territory, Israel has left no safe place for civilians and no way out of Gaza. An attack on the remaining concentrations of population in Gaza City or Deir al-Balah or al-Mawasi will mean more massacres, more mass displacement, and inflicting on the remaining desperate and starving population conditions that will lead to their physical destruction.What is Israel’s end game? Israel says that theoccupation of Gaza will be “temporary”. But by now we are familiar with the Orwellian rhetoric that conceals reality and true intentions. We know that before, in 1967, Israel started a “temporary occupation” of Palestinian and Syrian lands. It has become permanent. This is why the ICJ declared in July 2024 that Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza is illegal and violates basic and fundamental norms in international law, including the prohibition of acquisition of territory through force, the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and the prohibition on apartheid or racial segregation.According to the ICJ, Israel already occupiedGazaeven before 7 October 2023, thereby depriving Palestinians of freedom in their own homeland. This means that intent to “fully occupy” Gaza in August 2025 can only be a euphemism for something else in the context of this genocide.It means Israel is pursuing the messianic fantasy and the criminal enterprise ofa “Greater Israel”, with the goal of “maximum land, and minimum Arabs”. This goal is also clear in the continuing forcible displacements in the West Bank and the calls to “resettle” Gaza. Benjamin Netanyahu is not seeking to free Gaza from Hamas, he is seeking to empty Gaza of its Palestinian population. Already in early January 2024, the UN said that Gaza has become uninhabitable. In early November 2024, Israel’s former minister of defence, Yoav Gallant,who is wanted by the international criminal court, reportedly said that there wasnothing left for the army to do in Gaza. If so, what has the Israeli army been doing in Gaza since then?1:11'We will pursue you everywhere': hostage families warn Netanyahu against Gaza offensive – videoIsrael’s intentions are clear. In January 2024, Netanyahu, another fugitive of international justice, doubled down on his longstanding rejection of Palestinian statehood, and an overwhelming majority in the Knessetsupported his positionin July 2024. In April 2024, the UNrebuked Israel for expanding the “buffer zones” in Gazabecause it meant the permanent removal of the population.In May 2025,according to the Times of Israel, Netanyahu said that Israel was destroying homes in Gaza so that Palestinians would have nowhere to go back to and would be forced to leave their homeland. In July 2025, the current minister of defence, Israel Katz, announced a plan forthe ruins of Rafahthat was compared to a “concentration camp” by former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert. In recent months, the main Israeli activity in Gaza has been the systematic demolition of buildings by well-paid civilian contractors.In light of this, you understand the true meaning of Netanyahu’s statement that “Gaza” (rather than Hamas) “will not be a threat”, and why the recent cabinet decision would reject a role for the compliant Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority in Gaza. This is not about Hamas, nor about military objectives, nor about the hostages whose release Netanyahu has systematically sabotaged. Rather, this is a genocidal campaign that continues the denial of Palestinian freedom andseeks to impose Jewish supremacy, from the river to the sea.My years reporting on Gaza broke me down. Why did it take so long for the world to become outraged? | Phoebe GreenwoodRead moreAs Israel promises further escalation, it is fulfilling Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich’s, monstrous promise in April 2024 of “total annihilation”. For decades, the west has failed the test of human rights and international law, as Israel has increased the brutality of its occupation and consolidated its apartheid regime over the Palestinian people. Western states such as the UK will not be able to wash their hands from complicity in Israel’s mass atrocities in the past two years. By granting Israel impunity from accountability and by arming this rogue state, the west has enabled these atrocities. Recent declarations about recognition of a Palestinian state are a publicity stunt and a distraction that conceals this impunity but highlights the lack of action.It is beyond urgent, and legally and morally required, that all states take immediate and meaningful actions to stop Israel, including sanctions, arms embargos, the suspension of trade and diplomatic relations, and support the international courts to bring Israeli criminals to justice. Unless action is taken, Gaza – as Smotrich monstrously put it in May 2025 – “will be destroyed”.

It’s a cynical, idiotic doom loopMon 11 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 06.28 EDTShareImmigration has been a fixture of Britain’s political discourse for so long, it now feels, like Voltaire’s god, that if the issue did not exist, we would have to invent it. What would our politics look like, what would the broad majority of Britain’s media do with themselves, without immigration? It has become such a feature of the country’s political culture, it amounts to a sort of historical exhibit: “rivers of blood”, the “hostile environment”, “go home” vans, “controls on immigration”crockery, the Brexit “breaking point” poster, the Windrush scandal, “stop the boats”, “island of strangers”. And now, summer riots.What conjoins all of these is one thing: misinformation. I have banged on for years in this column about the disconnect between immigration discourse and the reality of how hard and expensive it is to enter the UK and stay there. A poll from last week demonstrates that gulf with striking simplicity. Theconclusion to be drawnfrom the survey is that support for hardline immigration policies is linked to ignorance about migration figures. Half of all respondents thought that there were more migrants living in the UK illegally than legally.According to YouGov, these perceptions are “wide of the mark”, with those in the country legally vastly outnumbering those who are not, even at the most generous estimates of irregular migration.But there is a new development related to that ignorance. Over the past 20 years or so, immigration demands have shifted from variations of “controlling our borders” and reducing numbers of new migrants, to demanding that zero migrants be allowed to enter, and “requiring large numbers of migrants who came to the UK in recent years to leave”. This is an “extraordinary” development, according to YouGov. Indeed, the last time a member of a political party even hinted at any sort of deportation policy was in the late 00s, when British National party leader Nick Griffin (another installation in the immigration exhibit)statedthat he would “encourage” voluntary repatriation of legal migrants and “those of foreign descent to return to their lands of ethnic origin”. On Saturday, far-right protesters clashed with police whileholding signssaying “Remigration NOW”.This latest mutation of migration discourse to include mass deportation is down to, as ever, media and politics. Rightwing media not only constantly cover immigration negatively, but go through different seasons of doing so, depending on the political climate. The 2010s was aboutMuslims, the run-up to Brexit aboutcertain east European nationalitiesand how their presence had a deleterious effect on British society, and the latest phase is about “numbers”. Specifically, numbers of irregular arrivals. The small boats fixation here is central, as they evoke a sense of losing control of the borders, sadly no longer as easy to pull off after Brexit.That fixation has been mirrored in political discourse. The last government’s contribution to this was the Rwanda scheme and Rishi Sunak’s “stop the boats” campaign – one of his five promises, which was given equal weight to such macro challenges as bringing down inflation and cutting NHS waiting lists. And this government has continued in the same vein.1:17Far-right and anti-asylum protesters gather in Nuneaton – videoKeir Starmer’s “island of strangers” speech, which referred to an era of rising migration as a “squalid chapter” in the country’s history, was the rhetorical opening salvo in an anti-immigration campaign that in its tone and relentlessness reinforces the issue as a crisis. Starmer’s X account constantly posts highlights of crackdowns against those who try “tocheat the system” and even Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)-likevideos of deportations. In the past week alone, Starmer has posted 14 times on X; 10 of those posts were about immigration, particularly irregular arrivals and those arriving on small boats. This is a wildly disproportionate emphasis, considering this cohort makes up aminuscule percentageof overall immigration to the UK.The result is a framing of all of immigration through the lens of irregular arrivals, and therefore cultivating a sense of crisis and overwhelm. Astudy by the University of Birminghamthat surveyed thousands of media texts and political documents earlier this year found that that disproportionate focus on small boats shapes public attitudes towards migration, fuelling “a sense of crisis and emergency”.There’s something compulsive about all of this, almost addictive. Posturing on immigration is a cheap hit, a low-cost (to politicians – the cost is very high for migrants) way to gesture at some sort of executive action, for a government otherwise in the mire. The irony is that this fixation produces ignorance about all immigration, which means there is less and less the government can do to address the very myths it has seeded. If you create the impression that small boats, “illegality” and cheating are the defining feature of the UK’s immigration, then how can you expect the public to make distinctions that their very government does not?Rupert Lowe reports charity rowers to coastguard as possible ‘illegal migrants’Read moreAnd so in a grim spiral, Labour continues to fuel the sense of crisis, then chase it, never catching up, and always setting the stage for those further right to make ever bigger promises of crackdown and deranged claims abouthousingandcrime. The galling idiocy of it all is that posting hectically about immigration and rolling out hardline measures is self-defeating. It doesn’t even work to instil confidence in Labour as the only credible party on immigration. The more Labour presses the issue, the more it reinforces the validity of anti-immigration rhetoric, empowering Reform as the specialised vehicle of crackdown. To voters mobilised by this, Labour can never be better than the real thing.And so it can only be a spiral. In order to keep immigration as that easily activated issue central to a political system that has few answers to any of the structural problems that are most salient to people’s everyday lives, from the cost of living to lack of housing, we must always be at some sort of breaking point. That toxic energy has to go somewhere. It’s not the sort of thing that can be just a casual part of discourse and stay in a holding pattern. The stakes are constantly higher, more frightening, more defining of why things are bad. And on and down it goes.We must wean the UK off its “immigration dependency”,Starmer saidin 2022. But the problem is his – and the entire political establishment’s – dependency on immigration as an issue to be exploited, rather than to be handled with honesty, duty of care to immigrants who are now terrorised in the streets, and to the whole country’s social cohesion.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But, if he acts now, that dark scenario need not come to passJohn Kampfner is the author of In Search of Berlin and Why the Germans Do It BetterMon 11 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 04.50 EDTShareThe passing of the 100-day milestone for any world leader usually denotes the end of their honeymoon period. Friedrich Merz has not been able to enjoy even a single day of grace, beginning with the very moment he was supposed to be elected Germany’s chancellor but wasn’t. On 6 May, as Angela Merkel watched from the visitors’ balcony, the Bundestag voted and declined to approve its new leader. For a few hours, chaos ensued, until the second round of voting sawhis chancellorship approved, so the swearing in could proceed.It was a symbolic act of defiance, and because it was a secret ballot, it wasn’t clear how many of the 18 dissenters came from Merz’s Christian Democrats (CDU) or from their new coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD). But it cast a shadow over the new administration from its inception: this is the government that nobody wanted – not least its protagonists.This is the verdict of most of the media and political class, the so-called Berlin bubble. Barely a day passes when Merz isn’t mocked as a dead man walking. He is trying to create a form of mainstream conservatism that is at once modernising – dealing with Germany’s lamentable embrace of digitisation, tackling bureaucracy, rebuilding infrastructure – and more culturally conservative. He is simultaneously accused of conceding too much to the left and of being in bed with the far right. He is denounced for being both vindictively punitive and emptily performative to migrants. This relentless drumbeat of negativity is the German equivalent of the dirge of “broken Britain”.Merz’s difficulties do not arise from a single source. They partly emanate from the way he is portrayed: the starched conservative, thin-skinned andwealthy(an attribute regarded as suspect in Germany). Some of this is unfair, some of it is not. He has handled himself with far more restraint and aplomb than originally predicted. Not that he has received much credit for it.The second problem is structural. To avoid political hegemony, every government must be a coalition. It must share power between parties but also between the federal centre in Berlin and the 16 regions. During the first 75 years of the federal republic, compromise was regarded as virtuous. Now it is seen as a mark of weakness.Which brings us to the present day. Trumpism has come to town, and Germany’s political culture is being infected by the same populist impulses as everywhere else. New media outlets are blurring the lines between fact and fiction, destroying careers, and leading mainstream politicians to behave in new ways. Parliament has become more unruly, and in a country that has long been synonymous with deliberative politics, MPs and ministers take instantly to social media with instant judgments on breaking news.The first battle of the new hyperpolarised era was played out less than a month ago, just as parliament was going into recess. The issue was the proposed nomination to the constitutional court of Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf, a judge who holds more liberal views on abortion than is permitted under Germany’s restrictive legislation. She was demonised by the press and the political right, leading some spooked CDU MPs to disappear on holiday early, to deprive her of the necessary majority. Senior government officials pulled the vote at the last minute, rather than face an embarrassing defeat. Her decision towithdraw her candidacylast week led to much fury in the SPD and soul-searching in Merz’s team. Even some more traditionalist MPs appeared to rue the fact that they had been swayed by pressure from the far right, and that the coalition had been undermined.This confected scandal forms part of awider strategyby the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) to split, weaken and eventually destroy the CDU, thereby becoming the largest party by the next election in 2029. Its members are open about their desire to make it impossible for Merz’s coalition to govern. To get anything through, Merz must agree it with the SPD. This leaves him vulnerable to the rightwing drumbeat that he is kowtowing to the “woke left”. This unnerves those on the right of the CDU, some of whom are urging Merz to abandon the so-called firewall that prohibits cooperation with the AfD. Any such break with this rule would give the German far right a potential route back to power for the first time since the end of the second world war.Meanwhile, the AfD’s share of the vote, according to Germany’s generally reliable pollsters, headsinexorably upwards. The party of the far right is on about 24%, three points above its already-impressive and alarming election result in March, and only two points below that of the CDU.The prospect of the AfD becoming Germany’s largest party is a dark scenario, but it is not inevitable. Two factors may yet work for the government. The first is the AfD’s tendency for infighting and overall incompetence. The other is the personal durability of the chief protagonists, Merz and his SPD deputy chancellor and finance minister, Lars Klingbeil.Two terms the coalition uses in much of its communications are:die politische Mitte(the centre ground) andhandlungsfähig(capable of getting on with it). They don’t set the pulse racing, but that is deliberate. Merz’s approach is not dissimilar to that of Keir Starmer in the face of the threat of Reform UK: soldier on and demonstrate to voters that the day-to-day grind still matters and hope that it produces rewards.Merz’s ministers point to a long list of planned action and legislation, which includes huge investment in critical infrastructure and security (the defence ministry now has a department called“expansion”), tightening migration and speeding up procurement. A scrap with their SPD partners is likely over plans to cut welfare, particularly the minimum income guarantee, but some form of compromise is expected in the autumn. Both parties will fight hard over the detail, if only to reassure their bases that they are sticking to their principles.It will be messy, sometimes dramatic, but the coalition may yet work. Merz and Klingbeil get on reasonably well – in contrast to the personal feuds that were a hallmark of Olaf Scholz’s administration. They know their parties may be in the doldrums, but they also know they will suffer even more if this government fails to deliver. There is nothing like jeopardy to concentrate the mind, not just for 100 days, but for the next four years.John Kampfner is the author of In Search of Berlin and Why the Germans Do It BetterExplore more on these topicsGermanyOpinionFriedrich MerzEuropeAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)commentShareReuse this content"

At the end of the day, I crash into the beanbag and he climbs up on my chest and we nap.To be clear, this is our family cat, but yes, in an eye-rollingly predictable move, the cat gravitated to the person in the household who was least interested.My now-disgruntled partner and our son campaigned for a cat for quite some time. My partner, let’s call her Cat Follower, is a cat follower (online and down the street). You can’t walk a block without her having to stop while she chases or coaxes a kitty from somewhere, eagle-eyed (is it wrong to mix in this bird metaphor?) and begins to smooch and trill and do whiskery tsks-tsks with her tongue. Ooh, you’re a feisty one, aren’t you, she whispers. They often are. They’re rarely morose chumps.‘Cuteness overload’: LA finds joy in a weekend of ‘Disneyland for cat people’Read moreI do realise I fall into a lineage of pathetic males who claim to barely notice cats until one turns in their direction, at which point said male abruptly U-turns from ambivalent to love-drunk smitten (skitten?).I spent part of my childhood on a farm where none of our pets were allowed inside the house. This meant dogs and cats were closer to the category of cow and chicken. They were treated by adults with a certain disdain; it was meant to be good for them. In hindsight it was often a guise for a lazy cruelty. I became a vegetarian as soon as I became an adult.Cats were a smoke that mingled with the shade beneath your feet and my little sister cuddled them along with ducklings and chicks and it appeared to be my job to find this fey or silly. According to family folklore, she also cuddled a fluffy gold duckling all day until its head propped forward.But, yes, my partner and our son campaigned and slowly I began to come to the following conclusion – small cats are small shade, like leaves. Or maybe it was more like: tiny cats are compact and probably have tiny sounds.Nonetheless, I acquiesced on the one condition. It had to be a small one. A small cat.The mistake Cat Follower made was to allow me to be the one to pick up our little “fully grown” kitten from the lost cat hotel. He’d been given the name Nathan and we thought that was quite funny at the time. I placed Nathan’s cage carefully in the footspace of the passenger seat of our old car and chatted to him all the way home to keep him calm. Nathan, you’re so small, you’ll fit right in.CatVideoFest: how clips of cute kitties spawned a million-dollar movie franchiseRead moreI’d read that it’s good to acclimatise new cats to your home, one room at a time, so I blocked off the rest of the house and carefully opened his cat cage in the living room. I figured this was a good approach to living with a cat, too – open one compartment of your heart at a time, but Nathan burst out and immediately climbed right up on to my chest to nuzzle my forehead, making me topple backwards in some magic glittering hoodwink.It was as if he’d read about newborns and skin-to-skin contact. He really was clever and seemed to really like me and I really liked him. We’ve been inseparable since.I recently received a print of UK artist David Shrigley’s artworks for my birthday, and it pretty much sums all this up because, well, my love for Nathan grew, as he did.Shrigley has painted an enormous cat in messy lime-green acrylic, the cat’s body spilling round his little front paws, wonky eyes, next to a frank statement in big red text which goes: THIS HUGE CAT HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO YOU / YOU MUST ACCEPT THIS SITUATION AND FIND JOY IN IT.Luke Beesley is a poet and singer-songwriter.

It’s more complicated and more exciting. It’s a constant process of exploration. An adventure into the unknown. Scientists come up with theories about what might be going on, and then test them. They don’t always get it right. Far from it. But inch by inch, testing, failing and trying again, they make progress.Robert F Kennedy Jr, during Senate confirmationhearingsfor the role of secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), seemed to get that. Those who feared what a vaccine sceptic might do in that role breathed again. “I’m going to empower the scientists at HHS to do their job and make sure that we have good science that is evidence based … I’m not going to substitute my judgment for science,” he said.Yet now, without good explanation or sound science, he iscutting$500m of research funding for mRNA vaccines, claiming that they “fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like Covid and flu”. In fact, no Covid vaccine fully protects against infection, but they have been shown to prevent deaths in billions of people. The 22 contracts that will be cancelled include one with Moderna for a vaccine against bird flu, which manyfearcould trigger the next human pandemic (and there will be one). Instead, federal funds will go to vaccines developed in more traditional ways.Either Mr Kennedy lied to Congress or he has a different understanding of science and evidence from most scientists, unpicking what they thought was uncontestable. The childhood vaccine schedule is being reconsidered, andmandatingthe measles vaccine is being questioned in spite of fatal outbreaks in the US. He has sacked the Centers for Disease Control vaccine advisory panel and replaced it with many people known to have sceptical views.Mr Kennedy is particularly hostile to the mRNA vaccines against Covid-19,panningthem in 2021 as the “deadliest vaccines in history”, wrongly claiming that half those suffering the rare side-effect of myocarditis would die or need heart transplants within five years. The vast majority have quickly recovered. Until 2023, he chaired an anti-vaccine organisation called Children’s Health Defense, where he petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to rescind the licence of all Covid-19 vaccines andcomparedmandating vaccines to Nazi oppression in the second world war.This is the stuff of internet scares; labyrinthine tangles of misinformation dotted with odd inaccurate nuggets of quasi-science. It doesn’t compare with the evidence base for mRNA vaccines, which went through clinical trials on hundreds of thousands of people and have since been used to vaccinate billions.Experts agree that the mRNA vaccines were a stunning breakthrough that allowed people to be protected in record time from Covid-19. They contain messenger RNA, a tiny bit of genetic code that teaches the immune system to fight the virus. No need to grow the virus in hen’s eggs, which takes months. The “plug and play” technology can be adapted against other viruses, such as flu, including some that devastate populations in poor countries. The inventorswon the Nobel prize in 2023.Mr Kennedy’s cancellation of funding not only stymies much research but also feeds worldwide doubt in mRNA vaccines. We are all the losers. Humanity needs these vaccines. Other countries need to step up with money and reassurance to try to heal this latest breach between science and nonsense. And Mr Kennedy is clearly unfit for the job he holds.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Its new hip practitioners – plus 1980s TV mainstay Roger De Courcey – explain why their vocal tricks and errant dummies are wowing audiences againAnya RyanMon 11 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 19.19 EDTShareIt is the greatest duet, performed solo.Ventriloquismacts became a popular entertainment in the 18th century and have flickered in and out of favour ever since, with a particular heyday on TV in the 1970s and 80s. Now a new generation of performers are reimagining the practice of “throwing your voice” to a puppet or dummy – and they are doing so not just in cabaret and comedy clubs but also on social media feeds.The art form has such a rich history that its modern-day practitioners can be “perceived as just doing an old thing”, says 25-year-old Max Fulham, who is in Edinburgh with his debut fringe show,Full of Ham. Fulham fell in love with ventriloquism when he was nine, absorbing everything he could find about the craft online. “I watched really old-school stuff like Ray Alan, Arthur Worsley and Terri Rogers … I have a massive appreciation for them.”As a ‘vent’, you can say what you want. It’s not you, it’s that little fellow sitting on your kneeDespite learning his trade with conventional puppets, Fulham now uses more unusual tricks in his act. “I think what a lot of ventriloquists are doing now is trying to modernise,” he says. InFull of Ham, this means audiences will be treated to sketch comedy, ventriloquism with objects, and some ventriloquism without anything that resembles a puppet at all. “It is very stripped back. That’s why it feels fresh,” Fulham says.“The stuff without puppets feels like a new path,” he continues. In the show, Fulham uses his voice to become characters that exist only in “the audience’s imagination” while being “an extension” of himself. “It has been a lot of fun to play with … it is the first time I’ve felt I’ve been truly alone on stage.”View image in fullscreen‘You must believe in the bear’ … Roger de Courcey and Nookie in 1976.Photograph: Chris Capstick/Rex FeaturesFulham is not the only ventriloquist trying to push boundaries. The Australian David Salter, who performs the showAn Evening With Dame Granny Smith, uses an apple as his puppet. “The idea is that I’m having an interview with Australia’s most famous apple of screen and stage,” he says. All he has to do to prepare his onstage companion is bite a face into the fruit “and leave it in the fridge for a couple of days”, he says. “It is that simple. But there’s something very whimsical about a puppet that sets out a childlike imagination.”Salter learned this firsthand. He began his career performing with a sock puppet at children’s parties, before branching out into work for older audiences. He cites his early inspirations as Nina Conti and fellow Australian Shari Lewis. While the content of his shows has shifted dramatically, one thing has remained constant. With ventriloquism, the audience are “having a shared hallucination”, he says. “You have to leave your sense of disbelief at the door.”Believing in the puppet is essential for performers, too. Lachlan Werner’s first show, 2023’sVoices of Evil, was created for his witch puppet, Brew, which he had saved up for weeks to buy from a toy shop in Worcester when he was seven. “We’re like old friends,” he says. “I will talk to her off stage, and before a gig I’ll be like, ‘Are you ready?’”For Werner, this relationship makes his performance. “It feels different to being on stage with someone else, but I do feel as if I always have backup,” he says, specifically mentioning the moments his puppet has “saved him” from a flop. “There is a strange thing where, if I think I’m not going to be funny today, I can look at Brew and she seems to say, ‘I’m good, we’ll be OK.’”The relationship between performer and puppet has always been central to ventriloquism’s odd allure. At the peak of his career, the now 80-year-old Roger De Courcey appeared on the 1976 Royal Variety Performance and made regular TV appearances with his sidekick, the growly teddy Nookie Bear. “You always feel there are two of you. You must believe in the bear,” he says. De Courcey came up during ventriloquism’s golden age, when it dominated variety shows, primetime TV and children’s programming. He credits his success to strong comic timing. “I was lucky because I was funny,” he says. “You’ve got to be able to think on your feet, just like a comic.” What drew him to ventriloquism was the licence it offered. “As a ‘vent’, you have a freedom because you can say what you want. It’s not you, it’s that little fellow sitting on your knee.” A puppet can get away with saying what a person can’t.View image in fullscreen‘A visual hook that stops people scrolling’ … ventriloquist Max Fulham with his puppet, Grandad.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThe art form still thrives on provocation. In Werner’s new show,WonderTwunk, he performs alongside a “really horrible puppet” that is nearly lifesize. “He’s like the villain of the piece, just a really icky character – the only puppet I have that I don’t like to be around.” For Werner, as with many ventriloquists, the key lies in building a full, believable persona.But which comes first: the puppet or its personality? For Fulham, the puppet he has used most over the years – Grandad – is rooted in old ventriloquist tropes. “I’m fully aware that a lot of ventriloquists in the past, and still now, will have an old man character,” he says. “It is sort of the archetypal puppet.”One of Werner’s most recent creations came from a “horrid boss character” he used to portray at gigs. “I was playing him with my own body and voice, and then wanted him in the show,” Werner says. Now, a version of him is in WonderTwunk too: a full-sized dad character, designed by puppeteer and prop-maker Freddie Hayes. “He’s a puppet that feels like he’s been grown out of me … he’s like a mix of Donald Trump, Cruella de Vil and Liza Minnelli,” says Werner.View image in fullscreen‘I knew her voice before I got her’ … Steph Ventriloquist with Kaylee.Photograph: Kaleid.meThe performer known asSteph Ventriloquist, meanwhile, specifically ordered and designed one of her puppets, Kaylee, to be a parody of the Kardashians. “I knew exactly what her voice was going to be before I even got her,” she says.No matter how surreal the act, things ultimately always come back to the performer and their hand. Good technique matters – even though De Courcey insists throughout our conversation that he “got away with” not having much of it. Still, most ventriloquists will have spent hours in front of the mirror, learning to keep their lips perfectly still. Steph first picked up a puppet during lockdown, and dedicated months to mastering the subtle arts of mouth control and hand movement. “I had all this time on my hands, so I thought, ‘OK, let’s learn how to do this,’” she says. It took her around nine months to “get good”, she estimates, and she talks me through the fine details that made the difference: keeping the jaw relaxed, placing the tongue precisely, knowing which letters are most challenging. “I spent more hours than I’d like to admit looking at myself. You have to, so you can see which words work.”Such precision is more important than ever in the age of social media, where tight camera angles leave no margin for error. Steph now has more than 22,000 followers on TikTok, where she regularly posts clips with her puppets. “You see quite a few ventriloquists on TikTok,” she says. “And I think those videos are making people stop and go: ‘OK, that’s actually quite cool.’”Fulham believes ventriloquism’s growing visibility online is key to its resurgence. “It has a bit of a visual hook that stops people scrolling,” he says. “It’s probably something most people haven’t seen before.” The short-form content mirrors the quick bursts of performance that audiences would see from ventriloquists on old variety show bills, too. “A ventriloquist would do, like, one minute of something on a TV show – that was all the time they had,” says Werner. “TikTok feels like that very old-school variety thing, where you see a tiny gimmick and then they go off again.”View image in fullscreenA bad apple … David Salter and Dame Granny Smith.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianSalter is confident that anyone who puts their mind to it can become a ventriloquist. When he began, he took out a book from the library and binge-watched YouTube videos. “If you watch the best people do it, you’ll really get a sense for the craft,” he says. “But you have to really love it, because it does take a lot of time and effort.”‘Casually jaw-dropping’: at an Edinburgh fringe of tricks and treats, Ben Hart has the magic touchRead moreFor those who do put in the hours, the reward is a kind of magic: the ability to bring a character to life with only your hands, your voice and a great deal of imagination. “It is a wonderful thing,” says De Courcey. “With Nookie Bear, I could tell anyone to fuck off and it didn’t matter.”Will the art ever regain the heights of De Courcey’s television heyday? Fulham isn’t so sure. “Things have moved to the internet now,” he says. “There isn’t that same culture of late-night TV any more.” Salter thinks it is a possibility: “It is still a niche act. But look what happened with Drag Race … the underground can just pop on to TV and become mainstream.” Whatever happens next, it is clear that a whole new generation of ventriloquists have begun to find their voices.Max Fulham: Full of Hamis at Pleasance Courtyard until 25 August.Lachlan Werner: WonderTwunkis at Pleasance Dome until 24 August.An Evening with Dame Granny Smithis at Underbelly George Square until 25 August.Steph Ventriloquistis on TikTok.Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025PuppetryVentriloquismEdinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)TheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then she had a near fatal brain bleed. The actor and artist discusses strength, survival, being upskirted on set, her violent run-ins with Harvey Weinstein and the performances she’s most proud ofMon 11 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 10.20 EDTShareAcouple of days before our interview, in late July, Sharon Stone announced on Instagram thather mother had died. When we meet over video link, I express my sympathies. Stone is known for her straight talking, but now she outdoes herself. “Mom, Dot, actually died a few months ago, but I was only ready to tell the public about it now because I always get my mad feelings first when people die.” What kind of mad, I ask – grief, confusion, loss? She smiles. “A little bit of anger and a little bit of ‘I didn’t fucking need you anyway’, you know!”Now she’s laughing. “My momwasn’tof a sunny disposition. She was hilarious, but she said terrible things to me. Dot swore like a Portuguese dock worker.” Which takes us to her mother’s final days. “She said: ‘I’m going to kick you in the cunt,’ to me probably 40 times in the last five days. But that was her delirium. And when the last thing your mother says to you before she dies is: ‘You talk too much, you make me want to commit suicide,’ and the whole room laughs, you think: that’s a hard one to go out on, Mom! But that’s how she was. This lack of ability to find tenderness and peace within herself.”Stone doesn’t do small talk. The actor, who became a household name with the 1992 erotic thriller Basic Instinct, is here to chat about her new film, Nobody 2, but the movie is going to have to wait. Stone talks about what she wants to talk about and today family dysfunction has top priority. To be fair, this makes sense – its impact has dominated much of her life, despite being hidden from the public until her 2021 memoir, The Beauty of Living Twice.That was when she revealed her maternal grandfather was a violent abuser and a paedophile. She said there hadn’t been a day in her mother’s life when Dot had not been beaten by him, from the age of five until she left the family home at nine to go into domestic service. Stone also said he had abused her and her sister when they were little girls.You never know what to expect with Stone. Horrifying trauma in one sentence, shopping at Cos the next. She’s at home in Los Angeles when we talk and looks fabulous – blond bob, huge pink specs, pearls “the size of small quail eggs”, a white shirt baggy enough for David Byrne, white trousers ripped in all the right places. She moves away from the smartphone, so I can see. “I will show you myentireensemble. The shirt’s down to my knees. Let me get where you can see all of me. Let me put you on my bookshelf and then you can seeallof me.” Now, she’s using her smartphone as a mirror. “I’m putting a little lipstick on for you.” I tell her I like her glasses. “Oh thanks. I’m a glasses whore, I have to be honest.”View image in fullscreen‘She was hilarious, but she said terrible things to me’ … with her mother in 2002.Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagicStone has often talked about being shy to the point of agoraphobia, but there is little sign of it today. As Dot said, she’s a talker: let the camera roll and you’ve got yourself a one-woman show. Imagine a scatological Norma Desmond as written by Alan Bennett.Her voice is deep and mafioso raspy. She talks in italics, deals in extremes, tells outrageous story after outrageous story, segueing between the savage and the empathic, naming names to give libel lawyers a heart attack, before finishing her sentences with: “Right?” as if daring you to disagree.For now, though, she’s not finished with Dot. Stone is 67 and for much of her life she thought her mother hated her. It was only later, when they became much closer, that she understood how troubled Dot’s life had been and the repercussions this had had for Stone and her siblings. Stone says Dot had a terrible death. “She was desperately afraid that when she died her mother and father would be there. She didn’t want to die, because she didn’t want to see them, because they were so awful. So I convinced her that I had put them in jail and they were not going to be there. She was in such hell.” She pauses. “Nobody comes through this life intact. So why do we pretend that one does?”Her mother certainly didn’t. Nor, for that matter, has Stone. In her memoir, she describes being locked in a room with her grandfather and her sister. It’s a beautiful piece of writing, merging the specific with the abstract so you’re never sure exactly what happened. At one point, she walks into a room when he appears to be sexually abusing her sister. Did he sexually abuse Stone, too? “Yes. And when I said so in my book, everybody went crazy about it and said I was telling other people’s stories. They were like: you’re telling your sister’s story, or this story, or that story. And I wasn’t telling anybody’s story. I didn’t name anybody’s name in my book. Not anybody unless they did any good.” It’s classic Stone, told with utter conviction – although she did name her sister.Was her sister upset with her? “She’s refused to read my book, even though she encouraged me to write it, as did my mom, and I dedicated my book to Mom.” Did her grandfather sexually abuse her mother, too? “Yes, of course, and all of her sisters. That’s why she was removed from her home when she was nine. In her gym class, she was bleeding through the back of her uniform and her teacher brought in social services. They removed her shirt and she had been so badly beaten that her back was covered in scars and blood.“I think the abuse is why all of her sisters went crazy. They were all treated for mental health problems. There were five of them and only my mom lived past 50. And they had a couple of other sisters who died in their early childhood.”Nobody comes through this life intact. So why do we pretend that one does?I ask how long her grandfather abused her for. “I got away from him by the time I was five or six, before he was super sexually abusive to me. I was a very savvy kid. I got away with much lighter abuse than other people did.”Stone knows she has upset people by exposing family secrets, but she’s willing to pay the price. “When you’re the person to break the family chain, nobody likes you, right? Your family doesn’t like you, your friends don’t know what is happening with you. People just think you’re crazy and there’s something wrong with you.”Although Stone’s relationship with her mother was troubled, she did observe a loving relationship between her mother and her father, Joe. Despite him being a harsh disciplinarian in her early years, Stone went on to have a wonderful relationship with Joe, a factory worker who became a tool and die manufacturer. He was a huge influence on her, telling her that if she wanted respect she had to demand it, and showing her how to assert herself in a man’s world. “My dad and I were tighter than two coats of paint.”I tell Stone I could listen to her talking about her family for ever, but we should talk about movies – particularly Nobody 2. She doesn’t seem to hear, because she has moved on to the contemporary US. “In my country, in a democracy, there is a thing that we have to respect the office of the president whether or not you agree with what’s happening. When the president decides to remove democracy, does that remove our agreement to respect the office of the presidency?”View image in fullscreen‘If you don’t like mothers and you don’t like women, you’re not going to get very far with creativity and expansiveness’ … with her eldest son, Roan, in 2021.Photograph: John MacDougall/AFP/Getty ImagesThat’s a good question, I say. What do you think? She says she doesn’t know, that she’s a Buddhist and in Buddhism they call it a koan – a paradoxical riddle that invites deep thought rather than a simple answer. She talks about the way the rights of protected minorities are being removed: “In our current administration, any disability is considered a fuck-off.”Take dyslexia, she says. Her son Roan has it “and he is running three corporations”, including Cahuenga Media Group, a production and licensing company that focuses on music, television and film-related media. Her brother Patrick, who died in 2023, had it and was a “brilliant” master carpenter. She points out that many architects and scientists are dyslexic. “But what we’re looking at now in America, is: ‘OK, no more disabilities.’ Suddenly, nobody with disabilities has value. OK, we’re gonna fire everyone in these scientific jobs. And guess what?France is taking all of our scientists.”Blimey! It’s not easy to keep up with Stone or get a word in (evidence suggests scientists are moving from the US to France because ofthe government’s funding cuts). She’s straight on to misogyny: “The sweetest fruit is at the end of the branch. These are the things that nature tells us, Mother Nature, Mother Gaia, Mother Earth. But if you don’t like mothers and you don’t like women, you’re not going to get very far with creativity and expansiveness.”Does it feel like an anti-women time in the US? She removes her glasses and pins me with her glare. “It doesn’t matter, because we makeyou. And we care foryou. And we raiseyou. And we feedyou. And we houseyou. And we show you where your stuff is, because you couldn’t find your fucking socks without us. So if you don’t have our intrauterine tracking device to help you find your ass in a snowstorm, I don’t know what you would do. So you can be as anti-women as you want to be, and you can make babies in a test tube if that’s the world you want to live in – and have a good time!”I assume she’s addressing Donald Trump, but it feels personal. I don’t want to live in that kind of world, I protest meekly. “Exactly! It’s never meant to be that way, because birds do it, bees do it, even educated fleas do it, so the rest of this stuff is just nonsense. To me. OK? Because I am very much in league with Mother Nature, Mother Gaia.”The young Stone was exceptionally bright, as she’s quick to tell me. She describes herself as “fiercely intelligent” (two well-chosen words) and her IQ is reportedly 154 (genius level). She skipped several grades at school; at 15, she and four boys were sent to Edinboro State College in Pennsylvania as an “experiment”, three years ahead of most of their peers. She majored in English literature and excelled at golf, but left before graduating. “My college professor was furious when I was leaving for modelling,” she says. “He was like: ‘You’re throwing away your career,’ because he really thought my career was in writing.”She moved to New York and became a successful model. In 1980, she made her movie debut as an extra in Woody Allen’s Stardust Memories, dazzlingly Monroe-esque, planting a kiss on a train window. She moved to Hollywood and took lessons from the acting coach Roy London, who also taught Brad Pitt, Robert Downey Jr, Forest Whitaker and Geena Davis. Over the next decade, she played numerous forgettable parts in forgettable films and television shows.View image in fullscreenBreakthrough … with her co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger in Total Recall.Photograph: Carolco Pictures/AllstarIn 1990, Paul Verhoeven cast her opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger inthe science fiction classic Total Recall. When she discovered Verhoeven’s next film was about an enigmatic writer and murder suspect called Catherine Tramell, she was determined to get the part. The problem was, Verhoeven, the screenwriter, Joe Eszterhas, and the male lead, Michael Douglas, didn’t want her, not least because she was largely unknown.Twelve actors(including the top choice, Michelle Pfeiffer, as well as Davis, Julia Roberts, Debra Winger and Kathleen Turner) are said to have turned down the part, which was regarded as risque and risky. Even when she started filming, Stone was convinced they were still looking for a replacement.Basic Instinct was a huge success, becoming theninth-highest-grossing film of 1992and taking more than $350m worldwide. More significantly, it wasthetalking point of the year. LGBTQ+ campaigners picketed it because they believed the depiction of Tramell was homophobic – a rare high-profile lesbian or bisexual character in a blockbuster and a sociopath at best. Critics scavenged over the film’s cultural carrion. Was it exploitative tack or, as the feminist academic Camille Paglia proclaimed, a compelling exploration of sexuality and power dynamics? Paglia said Stone gave “one of the great performances by a woman in screen history”, calling Tramell “a great vamp figure, like Mona Lisa herself, like a pagan goddess”.And then there wasthatimage. Or, at least, the idea of it. A split-second long – too short to fully register. Yet, somehow, almost seeing her vulva as she uncrossed her legs was more scandalous than simply seeing it. Stone said she had been duped into the shot, writing in her memoir that she was asked to remove her underwear to prevent light reflection and told nothing revealing would be shown. She had no idea it would be used as it was. Appalled, she considered legal action against the film-makers, but ultimately accepted the shot because it was true to Tramell’s character and artistic truth trumped personal humiliation. Basic Instinct madeSharon Stoneand, to an extent, destroyed her. Astonishingly, that one image came to define her.‘I didn’t know that this moment would change my life’ … recreating the infamous leg-cross scene from Basic Instinct at the GQ Germany awards in 2019.She’s still proud of the film and regards it as a great performance – one only she could have given. The problem is, she says, casting directors deliberately conflated her with Tramell. “They said I was just like the character, like, somehow, they found someone who was just like that and she slipped into the clothes and it was magically recorded on film. Not that it was a difficult part to play and that 12 other actresses of great fame and fortune turned it down. Then, as it played everywhere on the globe for the next 20 years, people started to go: ‘Do you think this really has anything to do with the fact that we thought we saw up her skirt? I think maybe it’s actually a pretty good performance.’“So it went from me being nominated for a Golden Globe and people laughing when they called my name in the room to people giving me standing ovations and making me the woman of the year. People came to recognise: she’s not going away, the film’s not going away, the impact of the film is not going away.” When she was named GQ Germany’s woman of the year in 2019, she recreated the scene, talked about the importance of empowerment and said, devastatingly: “There was a time when all I was was a joke.”The film didn’t go away, but Stone did. After Basic Instinct, she made one great movie, turning in an outstanding performance as the damaged con artist Ginger McKenna inMartin Scorsese’s Casino. And then, I begin to say …She finishes the sentence for me. “And then I got nothing. I never got any more parts.” Why? “I really wish you could tell me. Sometimes I think it was because I was too good.” Stone is not averse to bigging herself up. Nor is she averse to a conspiracy theory.“Sometimes I think when you get nominated for an Academy Award and the greatest living actor on the planet doesn’t, that’s an imbalance in the male-female dynamic that is not great.” Does she mean Robert De Niro, her Casino co-star? She nods, before suggesting it wasn’t De Niro that was upset, but the powers that be.Stone returns to the “too good” theory, telling me about a party she was at with Hollywood’s glitterati before the Oscars ceremony. “We were in this very small room. Sidney Poitier was there, Woody Allen, everyone. Francis Coppola came up to me and he put a hand on my shoulder, like my dad used to when something really serious was about to happen. And he said: ‘I need to tell you something and it’s really hard.’ He said: ‘You’re not going to win the Oscar.’ And I said: ‘What?’ And he said: ‘You’re not going to win the Oscar, Sharon.’ I went: ‘Why?’ And he went: ‘I didn’t win it for The Godfather and Marty didn’t win it for Raging Bull and you’re not going to win it for Casino.’View image in fullscreen‘I am a big fat loser like Marty Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola’ … with Robert De Niro in Casino, for which she earned an Oscar nomination.Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty Images“I looked at him and he went: ‘They can’t hear opera. And when you lose, Marty and I are going to be in the room, Sharon, and we want you to know you’re going to lose with us and we are there with you. But your performance will stand the test of time. Over the years, no one will remember who won and lost, but they will remember your performance.”The way she tells the story, with such po-faced gravitas, is some performance in itself. She continues, in the voice of Coppola: “‘And what you have to do as an actress is remember you are not a regular actress, you are an opera singer. And not everyone will understand you, and not everyone will understand your ability. You will lose with Marty and you will lose with me, but you will always be in our losers’ circle.’” She finally allows herself a smile. “So that is what I have carried through my life – that I am a big fat loser like Marty and Francis Ford Coppola.”It’s hard to know why Stone didn’t get offered the roles she deserved after Casino, although, aside from the conspiracy theories, there were some other reasons. In 2000, she and her second husband, Phil Bronstein, adopted Roan and she focused on motherhood. A year later, at 43, she had a near fatal stroke. It’s a miracle she survived – she says her brain bled for nine days and doctors gave her a 1% chance of survival. She had to relearn to walk, speak and read.Incredibly, she made a full recovery, but offers of work dried up. “In those days, as a woman, if something happened to you, you were done,” she says. “It was as though you did something bad or wrong. So even when I wanted to come back to work, it was like: ‘Sure, you can do four episodes of Law and Order,’ and that’s it. I did everything I was allowed to do to pay my penance for getting sick.” How long did that last? “That went on and on and on and on and I made nothing. And it just eventually became impossible to work.”Why didn’t I get more parts? I really wish you could tell me. Sometimes I think it was because I was too goodWhen she was offered parts, she says, they were rubbish. “I reached the point where, after my stroke, and nobody wanting me, and people wanting me to do this silly, diminished work, I decided that I’m not going to work any more.” She corrects herself. She decided not to accept roles she didn’t like, which in effect meant not working.She believes she has continued to be punished for Basic Instinct by the industry and in her private life. Stone says that when she and Bronstein got divorced in 2004, the film played a significant role in her losing custody of Roan. “They had my eight-year-old on the stand at one point, asking him if they knew his mother did sex movies.” She claims they reduced her to a soft pornography actor, then suggested that made her an unsuitable mother. She says the battle for Roan lasted 11 years, at which point she was finally given responsibility for Roan again. Nevertheless, at the end of her book, she thanks Bronstein and his wife “for finding a path to a whole, healthy and blending family with me. There is no greater gift.” As she says, she looks for the positive.In 2005, she adopted her second son, Laird, now 20, as a single parent, followed by her third son, 19-year-old Quinn, a year later. With no quality film work coming in, she focused on the art forms she had loved as a child – writing and painting. Her gorgeous impressionist and abstract expressionist paintings now sell for tens of thousands of dollars. The titles (Quaaludes, Hoisted on My Own Petard, If We Make It) could be short stories.I ask what the paintingIt’s My Garden, Assholeis about. “I was with a friend who was in her early 40s and had just had her second baby after losing her first. We were discussing how her in-laws had the audacity to tell her they thought she was a little too fat from the second pregnancy when a drone flew over my back yard. I thought: so many people have a lot of opinions about what we should do with our bodies and our faces while we’re delivering life on this planet, and taking care of everybody, and I was like: ‘You know what, it’s my garden, asshole!’”View image in fullscreen‘I’m having a fun time’ … at Torino film festival in 2024.Photograph: Daniele Venturelli/Getty ImagesStone also became an activist, raising millions for people with HIV. In 2016, at 58, she went back to university to get the degree she had started at 15. “When Hillary [Clinton] was running for president and said: ‘You can do anything,’ I thought: that’s true, I should get my degree.”Since Basic Instinct 2 in 2006 – much disparaged by critics and which she called “a piece of shit” – Stone has made few movies of note. But things are changing. This month, she’s back with Nobody 2, about a nobody, played byBob Odenkirk, who turns out to be a top assassin. “Now, I’m making good films. I was good in Nobody 2 and I know it.” She certainly looks as if she’s having fun as the crime boss Lendina. Stone says when she was offered the part, she insisted on transforming her into a feminist hero. “I said: ‘I need this villain to be more personal to me.’ I don’t want to play villains unless they touch the zeitgeist. So I wanted this villain to feel as if she came out of social media, because that is the most scary thing right now.”Why is she so often cast as a villain? “I think very beautiful, smart people are perceived in very specific ways. Because I’m a woman who is beautiful, it’s easier to have me not be emotionally intelligent, not have me be deep, not have me be tender and full. People don’t really believe that a beautiful woman is accessible to them.” And inaccessibility, she says, is regarded as a form of villainy. “Men don’t even ask you to date because they can’t imagine you are accessible to them. Within society, we have never said a woman can be beautiful and smart. And kind. And nice. And funny. And a mom. And the breadwinner. No, no, no, no. She couldn’t be all those things, because then,oh my God,she would be equal to a man! If I was beautiful and smart andnice,what would happen to society?”‘We don’t need more small-penis energy’… Sharon Stone on why she swapped acting for artRead moreFive more minutes, the publicist says. Stone is on a roll. “I could be UN person of the year, which I was [she was named the UN Correspondents Associationglobal citizen of the yearin 2023 for her humanitarian work]. I could pitch ideas to the United Nations and have them fulfilled and no one may ever know. I could be a Nobel Peace Summit award winner [in 2013 for her HIV and Aids work] and an Einstein winner [she won the Einstein Spirit of Achievement award in 2007, also for her HIV and Aids work]. I could win these awards, but we can’t also have me be nice, or kind, or compassionate, because what would happen?The. World. Would. Fall. Apart.”Actually, I say, one of my favourite films of hers is one in which sheiskind. In The Mighty, she plays the mother of Kieran Culkin’s Freak, a 12-year-old with a terminal condition. She says it’s one of her favourites, too. “And you know why I got that film? I’ll tell you exactly why I got that film. I got that film because I had a production deal with Harvey Weinstein and after years of him paying for my offices and my staff, paying for everything, he realised he wasn’t getting anything he was hoping for. And he turned around and said: ‘I’ve got this children’s book and I have to produce it.’” She stops, briefly. “But I was not going to fuck Harvey Weinstein.”Did he try it on with her? “Well, I’m not the girl he’s going to take into a hotel room naked and I’m not the girl he’s going to grab. Iamthe girl he threw across the room at a cocktail party. And Iamthe girl that he hit. And Iamthe girl whose ass he grabbed, but I’m not the girl he’s going to rape or molest and I’m not the girl he’s going to ask for a massage, right? But I am the girl he’s going to give a production deal to and going to get fed up with and give a children’s movie to deal with.”Stone has been associated with amfAR, an Aids research foundation, for 30 years, hosting many of its fundraising galas. In 2007, Weinstein got involved with the charity. “Harvey then put himself on the board, right? And backstage he would shove me around and yell at me and come on stage and grab the mic from me and try to make these inappropriate deals with his friends, like we’re gonna take that money from that guy on this item. Then I’d take the mic from him and say: ‘Harvey, get off the stage, I call the numbers, we’re not taking that deal.’“I’d come off the stage and he’d shove me across the room and go: ‘Don’thumiliate me,’ and I’d go: ‘You’re a crook, Harvey, get your fucking hands off me.’ He did not try to fuck me, but he was definitely physically violent with me. He slapped me, he threw me across the room, he shoved me around countless times.”Within society, we have never said a woman can be beautiful and smart. And kind. And nice. And funny. And a mom. And the breadwinnerLast question please, the publicist says. Perhaps she’s as exhausted as I am. Stone is over the top, a little unreliable, thoroughly immodest and rather magnificent.But it feels as if she has barely started. There is so much more to talk about. She has not even mentioned the time the producer Robert Evans advised her to have sex with her Sliver co-star, William Baldwin, to save the film and get a better performance out of him. (She was appalled and refused.) Or the time she had her breasts reconstructed after having benign tumours removed and the surgeongave her a nonconsensual breast enlargementbecause he thought she would be grateful.A couple of days before our interview, it was announced that Eszterhas, the Basic Instinct writer,was planning a reboot. Would she take part in it? She laughs. “There’s not going to be a Basic Instinct reboot. I hate to break it to you, but Joe Eszterhas couldn’t write himself out of a Walgreens drug store.”It’s 20 minutes since the publicist told me to wrap up. I’m beginning to feel guilty, but Stone is still happily talking about empty nest syndrome, now that her youngest boys have left for college, and her plans for the future. She says she may lease out her home because she has so many projects on the go in so many places. She mentions her part in the new series of Euphoria and “a beautiful film” called In Memoriam that she has already completed.It sounds like you’re in a good place, I say. “I’m having a fun time. All of a sudden, the kids are out and I’m like:nowwhat am I going to do? I think going back to work is what’s happening.” Despite everything – the abuse, the stroke, the fallout from Basic Instinct, the losses – she says she has always been a glass-half-full kind of gal. Actually, she says, even an empty glass can have its positives. “It can get refilled, right? Sometimes an empty glass is what you need.”Nobody 2 is in cinemas in Australia from 14 August and the UK, the US and Ireland from 15 AugustExplore more on these topicsSharon StoneThe big interviewinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The fans either love it or hate it – and there’s nothing you can do. Working on The Incredible Hulk, for example, took years. So when it’s a new creature, a lot of people get excited.”The guy who portrayed the Bloater got so hot he’d be put in a pop-up tent with air-con on fullThis near-blank canvas led Sims to an unlikely source of inspiration: the snapping mouth of a turtle. “When a turtle opens its jaws,” he says, “it looks like it has rows of teeth – but they’re actually fibres that draw food inward.” He combined this with a Venus flytrap and the result was that uniquely terrifying head that blooms open like a flower, revealing concentric rings of teeth, then clamps down on its prey, usually a screaming child. The Duffer brothers wanted only one modification: no face.View image in fullscreenInspired by a Venus flytrap ... the Demogorgon in Stranger Things.Photograph: NetflixFans of Stranger Things, whichreturns later this year, will find plenty to fear in Alien: Earth, which launches this week. Series creator Noah Hawley has promised a terrifying expansion of the film franchise’s already frightening monsters, introducing new creatures that will rival – and even surpass – the iconic, swoop-skulled, chest-bothering, teeth-within-teeth xenomorphs. “I think we’re giving them a run for their money, certainly,” Hawleyhas said. Alien: Earth, which is a prequel to the first 1979 film, leans heavily into unsettling body horror, too, with new creatures such as the T Ocellus, a jellyfish-like parasite that dislodges the eyes of other organisms in order to seize control of them from within. These newcomers will ensure the series isn’t just recycling established monsters, but introducing fresh causes of terror and revulsion.Like Sims on Stranger Things, prosthetic makeup designer Barrie Gower leaned heavily on nature when he was creating his monstrous designs for The Infected, the term given to humans who get the brain infection in postapocalyptic zombie horrorThe Last of Us. Fungus became an integral part of the creative process, with Gower and his team buying so many bags of “grow your own mushroom kits” for the studio to photograph and 3D print that they soon had 15 species on their hands. “Fungus,” says Gower, “is just such an interesting and beautiful kind of growth. There’s so much to play with.”Gower effectively had a “superpower” for creating monsters out of mushrooms: he hates them, despising everything from their smell to their texture.“It became quite easy to come up with designs that repulsed me,” he says.View image in fullscreenMushroom heavy … one of The Infected in The Last of Us.Photograph: HBOAlong with his mushroom aversion, Gower also has trypophobia, an intense discomfort triggered by the sight of clusters of small holes or bumps. “It gives you goosebumps,” he says. However, rather than avoiding the formations that make his skin crawl, he employed them for maximum grotesqueness in his designs for how The Infected look, finding the perfect guinea pig in his daughter Lottie, who shares his trypophobia. “If she’s like,‘Oh God no dad, I don’t like the look’, I know we’ve succeeded.”The White Walkers, those furrow-faced ice demons in Game of Thrones, required an entirely different approach. Costume designer Michele Clapton envisioned them wearing dark armour that looked salvaged and repurposed, resulting in an austere, unwieldy look. “It was so, so brutal to make,” Clapton says. “The cutting and the bending of the metal was incredibly labour intensive. The armorists just loathed it because they really cut themselves. It’s almost like a huge cheese grater.”The final pieces of armour proved so hazardous that the team actually had to create much safer leather duplicates for fight sequences, meticulously painted to mimic metal. Protecting all the prosthetics also proved difficult, given the sharp edges. Another major challenge, ironically, was keeping the White Walkers warm while filming in near freezing temperatures. “We had hot-water bottles we could place inside the costumes,” says Clapton. “But as there were so many prosthetics, you had to be really careful, because they could easily tear.”View image in fullscreenLike a huge cheesegrater … a White Walker in Games of Thrones.Photograph: Helen Sloan/HBOIn fact, keeping performers comfortable in elaborate costumes and prosthetics is a major headache for monster creators. Gower encountered this with the Bloater – the hulking, spore-spewing, elaborately ridged behemoth inThe Last of Us. “We built this big suit that, in terms of size, was like wearing a sofa,” he says. “It was made out of a very soft foam latex material. It’s like a huge sponge, but split into six sections and zipped on to the performer.” There was one very predictable consequence: “You just got really hot.”The inside of the costume could become so sweltering that, between shots, the team had to unzip the back and fan down Adam Basil, who portrayed the Bloater, sometimes even putting him in a pop-up tent complete with an air-conditioning unit on full blast to cool him down. According to Gower, the huge weight, restricted movement and the need for agility combined to make the Bloater costume ultimately unworkable. The team ended up enlisting the help of Wētā FX in New Zealand, who took detailed scans of all the Bloater’s textures and created a digital version.Such mega-budget productions give creators the luxury of experimentation, with digital backup plans should their monster imaginings go awry. But on shows such asDoctor Who, it’s a different story – as special effects artist Neill Gorton discovered. On the BBC’s cult show, he encountered something every bit as scary as the Time Lord’s weekly foes: a very limited budget.View image in fullscreenSend for the air-con tent! … the Bloater in The Last of Us.Photograph: HBO“It was a comedown in one way,” he says, “coming from working in Hollywood. I had a production design friend who introduced me to Doctor Who. When I asked what it was like, he said, ‘It’s fun – but they just don’t have money.’ I thought, ‘Well, what the hell, I just want to work on it.’ And sometimes it can actually be more fun, because you’ve got to be more creative.”Take the Weeping Angels, those statue-like alien humanoids that are able to send their victims back in time with a simple touch, gorging on the “time energy” this releases. Producers had initially envisioned using numerous statues, believing that costumed performers painted as statues would resemble street performers too closely. But there was a problem. “The sheer number of statues required would have been impossible given the timeframe,” says Gorton. “You would need a different statue for every pose. That would have been a minimum of 30 statues.”Forced to find an alternative, he suggested a design that was part prosthetic, part costume, part body paint. “The producers thought it was ridiculous. But we literally had no choice!” he says. Gorton would paint the actors, attach fabric, then “glue it all together and hope for the best”. At that point, he realised how little time he and the team had left to bring the idea to life – just two weeks, compared to the five they would normally have to prepare for an episode. Sadly, this realisation came too late: Gorton had already talked everyone into his idea.View image in fullscreen‘Total scramble’ … a Weeping Angel in Doctor Who.Photograph: James Pardon/BBC StudiosThe result? “A total scramble!” They discovered that the masks used to create the Weeping Angels’ haunting blank stare left the performers unable to see. Fortunately, this wasn’t a huge issue, since the creatures had to remain perfectly still – a feat the team achieved by having the actors sit on a bicycle seat attached to a hidden pole. “On a bigger budget,” says Gorton, “you would never go down that road. But given no choice, we just had to be smart and quick about it.”Of course, it isn’t just the pressure of budgets and time that lead to human-being-based effects. The Duffer brothers were adamant from the start: the Demogorgon would be portrayed by a performer in a suit. This presented probably the biggest conundrum when it came to designing the creature. “Its legs are unusually long,” says Sims. “It has kind of an extra joint. That makes it very challenging for an actor – to be put into stilts and have to run around and jump. The question was, ‘How do I keep the design the Duffer brothers love – but make it work for a person in a suit?’”Whatever the challenges and the solutions, Sims finds there is always one benefit of working with flesh-and-blood performers: they ground any design in reality. “It’s important to find things in nature the human eye can identify with,” he says. “If you take a human thing that’s scary, then you add all those things to it, that makes it even more scary.”Asked how he makes monsters such as The Infected so deeply disturbing, Gower makes a similar point: taking everyday things like mushrooms and making them seriously creepy is a guaranteed win. “Using realistic source material is the key,” he says. “Keeping things familiar is always going to make them more terrifying. It just gives you goosebumps.”Alien: Earth is on Disney+ from 13 AugustExplore more on these topicsTelevisionStranger ThingsDoctor WhoThe Last of UsFantasy TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Biddy Baxter, the TV genius who made Blue Peter matterBaxter was the sharp – if tough – TV brain behind the beloved children’s show’s most celebrated parts, from the studio pets to the coveted badgesMark LawsonMon 11 Aug 2025 07.45 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 15.26 EDTShareAs a child in Leicestershire in the 1940s,Biddy Baxterwas a devoted reader of the work of Enid Blyton. She sent the creator of Noddy and The Famous Five a fan letter and was so delighted to receive an answer that she replied with follow-up questions. To her dismay, the response was identical to the first.This sense of being let down by an adulated adult proved formative. When Baxter, who hasdied aged 92, was in charge of Blue Peter, the long-running children’s show that she essentially created, she introduced an alphabetical card index – that most efficient pre-digital database – to ensure that viewers received personalised replies.That innovation reflected the gentle side of her professional persona. Some presenters on the show complained of a darker side – domineering, dictatorial – but, if true, that editorial insistence reflected the extraordinary extent to which she wasBlue Peterand Blue Peter was her.It has been rare in the history of broadcasting for one person to mould and own a programme for so long. For 26 years (23 of them as editor) at Blue Peter, she was keeper of the flame and anyone seen as threatening its glow – staff, senior management, TV critics – was at risk of being burned.View image in fullscreenBiddy Baxter reads letters from Blue Peter fans while a lion cub lies on a sofa, in September 1968.Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty ImagesBaxter’s forcefulness may also have reflected the tactics required of a relatively rare powerful woman at theBBCin her time. The corporation was initially less male than many vintage British institutions – Lord Reith, the first director general, appointed three female heads of department in the 1920s – but the balance had shifted by the time Baxter joined in 1955. (As late as 1985, an internal report found that the male-female balance in senior positions was 159 to six.) Tellingly, when Baxter informed the careers department at Durham University that she sought a BBC career, she was steered towards secretarial or receptionist posts rather than the production jobs she envisaged.First employed as a studio manager in radio, she soon graduated to producing before, in 1962, being given a temporary transfer to TV due to a staffing crisis. (Something similar happened to David Attenborough, underlining the extent to which TV, in its early decades, was an accidental, undervalued medium.) When Baxter was given a permanent Blue Peter contract in November 1962, the programme (created by John Hunter Blair) had been running for four years. She made it into one of the most distinctive and significant broadcast brands, changing her own life and those of tens of millions of British children across many generations.Baxter introduced or popularised all the most celebrated elements – the Blue Peter badge for viewer achievement; the pets (most notably, the mongrel Petra and the border collie Shep); the presenters’ summer holiday to film reports in a foreign location; and the “makes”, in which a doll’s house or a fort was created from everyday family refuse such as cereal packets and washing-up liquid bottles.As a perfectionist, Baxter was irritated that the most attention resulted from things going wrong – a girl guides’ campfire threatening to burn down the studio, or Lulu the baby elephant copiously urinating and defecating before treading on the foot of the presenter John Noakes and dragging her zoo keeper through the mess.Although from a generation raised on the wireless, Baxter (like Attenborough) had an instinctive understanding of how television could and should work. The catchphrase associated with the makes, “Here’s one I made earlier,” as the presenter pulled a complete model from under the table, was a practical solution to the time constraints of a 15-minute programme (later lengthened to 25 minutes) now routinely used by craft and cookery shows. Another link phrase, “And now for something completely different” (later satirised by Monty Python), originated in the sudden jumps of subject that were a feature of the series.View image in fullscreenBiddy Baxter, photographed at Bafta.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianBaxter’s reputation inside and outside the BBC for tetchiness partly resulted from her fierce defence of Blue Peter’s legacy. Baxter was infuriated by claims that there had been two Petras (the second substituted when the first one died) and that she had sacked the presenter Christopher Trace in 1967 for getting divorced and Michael Sundin in 1985 for being gay. Baxter always insisted that the two hosts were shown the door for being difficult with the crew or unpopular with viewers, and that before Petra an unnamed puppy had died of distemper.The concept of the presenters being a big brother or sister to the viewers (the target age was six to 14) meant they were replaced as they aged. By 1988 it seemed anomalous to some that a 55-year-old was editing the leading BBC children’s show and it was perhaps convenient to both sides that Baxter resigned when her husband, the musical educationist John Hosier, took a job in Hong Kong. However, on returning to the UK she was tapped as an adviser to director generals for her sharp TV brain. The increasing marginalisation of Blue Peter due to technological trends – it is now screened weekly on a niche channel – was painful to her in later life.Strikingly, at a time when TV was considered disposable even within the industry – few shows were archived due to the cost and space of doing so – Baxter understood the significance of what she was doing, insisting on every show from the mid-60s onward being recorded. It was a declaration that Blue Peter mattered and, largely thanks to her, it did.Explore more on these topicsBlue PeterChildren's TVBBCTelevision industryTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Decades after it was abandoned, Queen Kelly will now be shown at the Venice film festivalPamela HutchinsonMon 11 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 11 Aug 2025 19.16 EDTShareIn the long history of Hollywood excess, there is no tale as torrid as that of Queen Kelly. This lavish silent melodrama starring Gloria Swanson and directed by Erich von Stroheim will screen as the pre-opening event at this year’sVenice film festival, with a new score by composer Eli Denson. The film is an outlandish saga of illicit love in sordid surroundings – and so is the story of its production.Queen Kelly is set in Europe before the first world war and tells the story of Patricia Kelly (Swanson), a convent girl who falls in love with a prince (British actor Walter Byron) who is engaged to a deranged queen. Patricia is sent away to Tanzania, where she is forced into marriage with a vile character called Jan, later earning the nickname Queen Kelly. It’s a far-fetched tale, which sets a curious tone from the beginning with its infamous meet-cute, in which Patricia is so overawed by meeting the prince that her knickers fall to the ground.On the first day of shooting in 1928, Swanson had a premonition that the film would never be finished, and events proved her correct. The screening at Venice consists of a new restoration by Dennis Doros that incorporates previously unseen material, and some inventive methods of recreating the film’s grand finale. He describes this version as a “reimagining”. Viewers of the film have always had to fill in the gaps, as did those who wanted to learn what happened behind the scenes.View image in fullscreenAs immoderate as ever … Swanson believed Von Stroheim had taken the film in a direction that would never get past the censors.Photograph: Courtesy: Venice BiennaleThe story of the film begins with a love affair. In 1927 Swanson was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, married to French war hero Marquis Henry de la Falaise, when she met the married Boston businessmanJoseph P Kennedy, father of the Kennedy clan. The following year Swanson and Kennedy became lovers, and their relationship was soon an open secret in Hollywood. Swanson, who was living beyond her generous means, put her financial affairs in his hands.Kennedy had been in the movie business for some years, and together they planned a lucrative showcase for Swanson’s talent. Making an expensive silent film when the talkie revolution was already in motion was one questionable decision. The next was hiring Von Stroheim to write and direct it. He was anything but a safe bet, known for his censor-baiting storylines, immense profligacy (insisting the extras in 1922’s Foolish Wives be supplied with silk underwear) and epic running times (his original cut of 1924’s Greed was said to be nine hours long).Von Stroheim proved as immoderate as ever. In the third month of filming, with costs soaring, Swanson and Kennedy called the whole thing off. Her objection was that Von Stroheim had taken the narrative in a direction that would never pass the censors. The scenes they were working on in Africa were clearly set in a brothel. She was exhausted by his reshoots and horrified by having to do a scene in which Jan (Tully Marshall) dribbled tobacco juice on to her hand. She called up Kennedy, saying: “Our director is a madman.” For his part, Von Stroheim claimed the shoot was abandoned purely because the coming of sound rendered this expensive silent film obsolete. Whatever the reason, Swanson and Kennedy cut their losses, which totalled a reputed $800,000.View image in fullscreenFar-fetched … Swanson, left, in Queen Kelly.Photograph: Courtesy: Venice BiennaleVon Stroheim was unceremoniously removed from the project. He would never complete a film as director again, although he would continue to find success as an actor, dubbed the “The Man You Love to Hate” for playing German villains, most notably in Jean Renoir’s 1937 classic La Grande Illusion.Swanson and Kennedy tried to complete the film as a talkie and even a musical. A 1932 cut of Queen Kelly was shown in a few countries, but this was essentially only the film’s first half. Fast-forward to 1950, when Swanson staged her own glorious comeback, playing washed-up silent film star Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder’s black comedy Sunset Boulevard. None other than Von Stroheim was hired to play Norma’s butler, the man who keeps her fantasy of enduring fame alive. And when Wilder needed to use a scene from one of Norma’s old movies? A clip of Queen Kelly was chosen.Swanson was back in the spotlight, and one of her most famous follies was once more a talking point. From then on, she did her best to revive the project she once thought was doomed – screening her cut of the film at one-off events and even on US TV, with the words: “This Queen Kelly gal was a child that somehow didn’t want to be born.” Swanson died in 1983, just two years before Doros completed his first reconstruction. He used Swanson’s own prints and outtakes, which had been preserved at the George Eastman Museum. This new restoration, and its red-carpet premiere in Venice, may just be everything that Swanson dreamed of for her lovechild Queen Kelly. Von Stroheim, one suspects, would prefer to try a few more takes.Queen Kelly screens in Venice on 26 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmVenice film festivalFestivalsThe KennedysFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trivium, Machine Head and Gojira headline this edition of the 20,000-capacity gathering, making for one of the most stacked lineups in recent memory.On Friday, Emperor prove why they’re still black metal’s measuring stick, despite having released no new music since 2001. Such tracks as I Am the Black Wizards are masterpieces of infernal majesty, keyboards blaring while singer/guitarist Ihsahn shrieks and makes his instrument wail. No other band combine adrenaline, anguish and ambition this excellently. Charging back after a Bullet for My Valentine co-headline tourended in ugly fashion, Trivium bring every bell and whistle they can. The Floridians cover Black Sabbath and Metallica, then inflate a gigantic mascot, comparable to Iron Maiden’s Eddie, to hammer home the sense of occasion. Guest appearances from Machine Head, Sleep Token, Malevolence and Emperor members reaffirm these 90 minutes as a proud celebration of all things metal.Machine Head returned to the festival circuit after eight years away with an intimate set at Bloodstock 2022, and on Saturday, the thrashers triumph at full scale. Where Davidian blows through presumably the entire pyro budget, Darkness Within gets thousands of phone torches piercing the air. But the most amazing moment is Halo: a nine-minute labyrinth of harmonies and solos, worthy ofthe extreme metal Mount Rushmore. The band’s crowd-surfer count of 1,011 sets a new festival record.View image in fullscreenThe front row for Gojira.Photograph: Abbi Draper-ScottSunday wraps up with a one-two punch of prog metal. Despiteweathering an acrimonious splitwith founding guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds in March, Mastodon haven’t lost an iota of strength. Temporary member Nick Johnston fits right in, to the point that he and co-shredder Bill Kelliher play rock-paper-scissors during one staccato riff, and Blood and Thunder smacks as mightily as ever. And Gojira’s blazing set is more a victory lap than a statement of intent. In 2018, Bloodstock became the first festival to recognise the crusaders’ headline potential, and they return as proven arena-fillers. Flying Whales and Another World are supercharged yet conscious anthems that hardly need the accompanying cinematic visuals to bolster their impact. The most action-packed weekend on 2025’s heavy metal calendar has come to a very apt close.Explore more on these topicsMetalFestivalsMusic festivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The 14-year-old singer-songwriter and granddaughter of Australian rock great Jimmy Barnes had promised herself she’d be strong. But when she found herself surrounded by other young people voicing their fears about the climate crisis, she let the tears fall.“I was really worried people were going to see that and think I was overly sensitive,” she says. “But I was a child. Iama child. And I realised how important it was for other kids to see that it’s OK to feel deeply.”Just 57 companies linked to 80% of greenhouse gas emissions since 2016Read moreRodgers is one of eight children from around the world who are featured in Future Council, a new documentary from Damon Gameau, the Australian director of crusading documentariesThat Sugar Filmand2040. The film follows Gameau and the group of young climate activists on a road trip across Europe in a yellow school bus, on a mission to voice their concerns about the planet’s great environmental challenges in the boardrooms of some of the world’s largest and most powerful corporations. They ask to be heard as a council of children, speaking for their future.It’s a bold premise, and one that invites scrutiny. Can a group of children really influence multinational corporations – or a well-meaning but ultimately futile symbolic gesture?Gameau is aware of the tension. “They’re not here to save the world or understand the complexities of geopolitics,” he says of his young subjects. “But they bring a refreshing creativity and moral clarity that makes adults think differently.”Future Council’s most compelling scenes are not the boardroom showdowns – “You’re not a powerful leader, you’re a disgrace,” 12-year-old Skye tells one multinational executive – but the quieter, more vulnerable moments. One takes place by Lake Geneva, where the children, overwhelmed after a visit to the Nestlé corporation headquarters, are given a moment to sit and offload some big feelings and fears about the future of the planet.A few are in tears. One child walks off, unable to continue filming. It’s uncomfortable viewing. Are these kids being exploited? Is this just there to tug at the viewer’s heartstrings?Gameau is acutely aware of the responsibility he had, and has, to the children. “We didn’t know what was going to happen,” he says of that day by the lake. “It wasn’t about making them cry. It was about creating space for real conversations.” After having watched it with audiences, he believes this scene is “incredibly potent because I think the children actually give permission for adults to let go and have a big cry around this stuff. I feel like so many of us are holding this overwhelm at bay.”View image in fullscreenFilming the movie became ‘a beautiful travelling circus’, says Damon Gameau.Photograph: Madman EntertainmentWhen the cameras stopped rolling, Gameau jumped into the lake, fully clothed, to break the ice and relieve the tension. One by one, the children and their parents followed.“We were carrying so much,” he says. “That moment shifted everything.”The production team took duty of care seriously. Each child travelled with a parent or guardian. A coach full of parents and crew and luggage followed the yellow bus. Daily wellbeing check-ins were held. The children and adults stayed in shared houses, cooked meals together and played outside to unwind, and formed what Gameau calls “a beautiful travelling circus”.Since filming wrapped, the support has continued. Parents received guidance on social media exposure and the children remain in close contact. The group travelled to the United Nations general assembly to screen the film and conduct a global press conference; now they’re in Australia together for the release (only two of the children are Australian).Future Council has inspired a growing youth-led movement, with more than 150 children around the world forming their own councils to collaborate on environmental solutions and advise businesses on sustainable practices. Ten more children joined up at a preview screening on the Gold Coast last week.View image in fullscreenThe Future Council meets with the CEO of multinational bank ING, Steven van Rijswijk.Photograph: Madman EntertainmentCouncil members have already started working with Officeworks to co-design eco-friendly school supplies, with profits going to Future Council regeneration projects where the children vote on how the money is allocated – an arrangement the Future Council hopes to set up with companies around the world in the coming years.The council’s manifesto is clear-eyed. “We will not be used for media stunts, marketing spin or greenwashing,” it reads. “We won’t be adult-washed and we don’t accept money unless there’s honesty and a visible commitment to change.”Still, the question lingers: does Future Council give children a false sense of agency – an illusion of hope?Rodgers doesn’t think so. “We were completely us,” she says. “And I think that’s what made the corporate leaders listen. They went from being a brick wall to becoming more human. We got through to them on an emotional level.”One of the film’s most talked-about scenes takes place at ING, where the children challenge bank executives on their environmental policies. Gameau recalls the shift in the room – from corporate detachment to genuine engagement.“To their credit, ING leaned in,” he says. “They’ve offered to support the Council and introduce [the film] to 40,000 of their clients. Of course, there are limits to what they can do. But they saw that these kids have something to offer.”Rodgers, who is now 15, has since signed a record deal with Universal, released a single inspired by her experience and given a TEDx talk on the film and the movement it has inspired.Her cover of Coldplay’s Fix Youfeatures in the film’s trailer. It’s a haunting, hopeful anthem for a generation grappling with uncertainty.She’s optimistic, but not naive. “It can be scary, especially when people aren’t listening,” she says. “But being in these communities where people truly hear each other, that’s where change begins. I don’t think we’re pretending we have all the power. But we’re not powerless either.”Future Council isin Australian cinemas now.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

James Clements, playing the part of Robert Burns, says something about the weather, and suddenly a streak of lightning cuts down the length of the table top. It has a gash down the middle for that very purpose.It is a sign of the attention to detail in Cora Bissett’s excellent production. What could have been a by-the-numbers tribute to Scotland’s national poet is altogether more subtle, imaginative and contentious. The long, undulating table, designed by Jenny Booth and cleverly lit by Elle Taylor, continues to play an unexpected part: Clements appears from beneath a domed plate cover in a scene of hungover contrition, while a cutlery boat sets sail under its own steam towards the West Indies.Oh yes, the West Indies. One of the inconvenient truths about this people’s poet, the man who wrote the egalitarianA Man’s a Man for a’ That, is that it was only his newfound career as a published writer that stopped him heading to Jamaica to work in the slave trade.Clements’s script, drawing on private letters and recently digitised historical archival material, plus the voices of modern commentators, does not gloss over this, nor the poet’s womanising. Rather, it presents a rounded picture of a contradictory man who could write tender verse one minute and abandon a pregnant woman the next.Burns is embodied with gusto and rounded Ayrshire vowels by Clements, accompanied by Lisa Rigby, singing sweet renditions of favourites such as Ae Fond Kiss on guitar and shruti box. It works as both a primer to the short life of this farmer turned celebrity and a knotty study of his politics, compromises, artistic enthusiasms and colourful love life.At theGeorgian House, Edinburgh, until 16 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalRobert BurnsPoetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

There is tension between the pressure for comedians to bare their souls to achieve success, and McQueen’s conviction that true bravery means taking risks that might not pay off. And it’s all cut through with enjoyably grotesque jokes about McQueen’s online activities, a memorable segment featuring alter ego Professor Franklin, and an uncomfortable encounter with McQueen’s teenage self.There’s a heady mix of introspection and mischief as McQueen pulls the rug multiple times, teasing that we might finally get to see behind the metaphorical (and at one point, literal) mask.

Baring their souls through song, Ohio is introduced as a “death concert” in response to the indie-folk musicians’ young son asking what happens when we die. But this bittersweet story of family, faith and loss is almost ferociously about grabbing hold of life.The Bengsons create harmonies that glide directly to the top of your spine. Both clearly feel the music in their bones, but it’s Abigail who shows it, her body unable to resist moving to the tumbling scales they create together, her bright, beaming face turned up to the sky. Director Caitlin Sullivan helps the pair gracefully shape their story on stage, treading softly between gig, presentation and choir rehearsal.The potted narrative sticks closer to Shaun, who is the drily comic balance to Abigail’s bounding enthusiasm. Guiding us through his repressive Lutheran upbringing, he eases out of the religion’s grasp but holds on to what faith means for his father, and what his father means to him. Narrowing our focus, the show homes in on Shaun’s degenerative hearing loss. In one revelatory scene, their microphones are modulated for us to understand what Shaun hears now, certain tones and consonants absent to him, then thickening and distorting as that blank mugginess will intensify over time. With creative captions that tremble as the sensory experience distorts, this slow theft is devastatingly wrought.Dance People review – join Edinburgh festival’s promenade of protest and playRead moreThe pair create the atmosphere of holding our hands throughout, with angelic, ululating folk song accompanying the thoughtful ways they see and explain life. Their story serves as both a formal introduction to them as a couple as well as a deeply spiritual meditation on the world we live in. A revenant hush accompanies everything they say. A song to Shaun’s choirmistress who helped a shy, almost unspoken child unfurl is shattering. Made freshly aware of time slipping through our fingers, no one wants to miss a moment.AtUpstairs at Assembly Roxy, Edinburgh, until 24 August.

And cult favourite1927mixes real performers and retro animations.Now, with high-intensity colour, psychedelic landscapes and trippy imagination comes visual artist Ornagh and a show unlike any in Edinburgh. In The Ode Islands, she performs while sandwiched between two screens to give three-dimensional depth to her mixed-reality creations. A nightmarish vision of googly-eyed monsters, electric seas and an Alice in Wonderland sense of instability, it takes us on a fascinating digital journey, with Ornagh trapped in the midst of it all. Her stated interest is in freedom, even as she pulls us ever deeper into an imprisoning lair.View image in fullscreenDigital demons … The Ode IslandsShe begins in a gingham dress, a woman trying to conform to idealised images of 1950s American housewives and warped commercials from a materialist culture. From there, it is a Wizard of Oz head trip as her character takes flight, chased down oppressive passageways like the darker corners of her own subconscious. Suddenly, she is talking about a trip abroad for a breast augmentation operation, the neglect of a friend and subsequent regret. Then she is back on the run from her digital demons.‘TikTok is like an old-school variety show’: what’s behind the surprising boom in ventriloquism?Read moreAddressing the audience at the end of the show, she explains the work brings together highlights from a series of previous art installations. That would account for the narrative uncertainty. Never less than fascinating, The Ode Islands hints at the artist’s preoccupations with identity, sexuality and body image, but keeps them opaque.

Chapman is part of a three-person presenting lineup alongside Kelly Cates and Gabby Logan, who will work on rotation this season afterthe departure of former lead presenter Gary Lineker.It is understood Cates will host a programme on Wednesday of Uefa Super Cup highlights and a look ahead to the new Premier League season, while Logan will host Match of the Day’s Sunday night programme this week.The BBC announced on 15 January that Cates, Chapman and Logan would be the new presenting team. It came after weeks of speculation about who would take over from Lineker when he said last year that he was stepping down. The 64-year-old had long intended the final Match of the Day of last season, on 26 May, to be his last, but he was planning to stay on to front the BBC’s live coverage of the FA Cup and 2026 World Cup.However, he announced he was bringing forward his departure after a social media row when he shared a post relating to the Gaza conflict that contained an antisemitic symbol. Lineker, the BBC’s highest-paid presenter and host of Match of the Day since 1999, apologised unreservedly for the post but said it was “best for all concerned” if he left completely.Cates has been a presenter with Sky Sports since rejoining the broadcaster in 2016, fronting coverage of the Premier League.

I don’t think that presents Britain in a particularly good light in the 21st century.”Clive is one of the most controversial figures from Britain’s colonial past. The historian William Dalrymple has called himan “unstable sociopath”anda violent asset stripper.The bronze statue, by the sculptor John Tweed was completed in 1912. It shows him in formal dress with one hand resting on the pommel of his sword, the other clutching papers. The inscription on the statue’s pedestaldeclares him simply as Clive.Lady Debonnaire, a former shadow culture secretary, said the statue and the panels around its plinth gave a false impression.“What it doesn’t do is contextualise or indeed give any honesty about what his presence in India actually did. He extracted a vast fortune. His former home, Powis Castle in Wales, contains hundreds if not thousands of objects that he took.“What the statue doesn’t do is give any honesty about the impact of colonial rule on India. There is still a popular view held publicly across the UK of empire as beneficial to its recipients.”Debbonaire described this as “wholly inaccurate”. “Before colonial rule, India was a very developed country. It understood free trade, it was trading with its neighbours – something the East India Company and the other colonising forces successfully crushed.“Since independence, India has grown economically, scientifically, in engineering terms, in computing terms, artistic, and so on and so forth.”Debbonaire was a Bristol MP when Black Lives Matter campaignerstoppled the statue of the slave trader Edward Colstoninto the harbour in 2020.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Things got better but now things are rapidly and urgently getting worse.“What happens in America always happens here, and as we look down the barrel of a Reform government, we, the gay community, queer community, should be revolting in terror and anger and action.”Reform has promised to ban what it called “transgender ideology” in schools within its first 100 days of government.According to the party’s manifesto, its education policies include plans for a “patriotic” curriculum, tax relief of 20% on private schools and cuts to funding for universities “that undermine free speech”. It has also pledged to replace the Equality Act and said it would scrap diversity, equality and inclusion rules.Davies also said Trump was “literally out to get us” and “would be happier with us invisible and gone, defunded, completely invisible if not biologically altered” to become as straight as him.The Doctor Who showrunner called on the younger generation of LGBT people to organise and fight back against the rhetoric and policies that have emerged on the hard right of British politics.“I hope they’re prepared to fight, that younger generation that has no idea how they got there. And neither should they; they’re busy living their lives. I didn’t spend my youth looking back at World War Two. But I do think: ‘Are you prepared to fight? Because a fight is coming.’”Davies’s next Channel 4 series, Tip Toe, deals with the culture war that has radicalised some people into homophobia, transphobia and prejudice.Channel 4 has said the show will look at “the most corrosive forces facing the LGBTQ+ community today, examining the danger as prejudice creeps back into our lives”.Davies said: “It’s radical, it’s savage, and it’s hilarious. It is the strongest thing I’ve written. I do believe Queer As Folk, Cucumber, It’s A Sin and Tip Toe are the ones that will be on my gravestone.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m 61 years old. I know gay society very, very well, and I think we’re in the greatest danger I have ever seen.”In April, he also hit back at claims Doctor Who was too woke. “Someone always brings up matters of diversity,” he said. “And there are online warriors accusing us of diversity and wokeness and involving messages and issues.“And I have no time for this. I don’t have a second to bear [it]. Because what you might call diversity, I just call an open door.”Explore more on these topicsRussell T DaviesLGBTQ+ rightsReform UKDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Ideally, we’d want to go on to add a third or fourth space.”The Prince Charles had looked previously into taking over the Filmhouse in Edinburgh, which was forced to close in 2022 before itreopened in June this yearafter a refurbishment.Vickery thinks Stratford – an area that has undergone huge regeneration over the past decade,boosted by the Olympic legacy of London 2012– could be an ideal place to open a new outpost.“Stratford has always been a hub,” he said. “There are plenty of students and loads of new-build properties that have sprung up recently. But it also feels like it’s still trying to find its feet and figure out what it is.”‘The city is being hollowed out’: the billionaire landlord locked in a David v Goliath battle for London’s West EndRead moreThe Prince Charles Cinema East would join other cultural institutions such as Soho Theatre Walthamstow, Sadler’s Wells East and theV&A East Storehousein that part of London, while the Theatre Royal Stratford East would be a nearby neighbour.The cinema has high-profile international fans, including the directors Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino and John Waters. It wasopened as a live theatre in 1962and taken over as a repertory cinema in 1991 with cut-price seats.When news broke that the cinema could be forced out of its original location in Leicester Square, a petition against the move generated 100,000 signatures in a single day.Vickery said: “The response was so humbling, I knew we’d have a load of interest in helping us out but the volume of support and speed with which it spread was a surprise.“You feel the responsibility but in the best possible way. You’re not just some pokey cinema in central London, what we do means something to people.”Explore more on these topicsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

I used to have a couple of pints before recording it, to numb my brain for his terrible rhymes,”Brooks told the Guardian in 2017, adding: “Grandmas come up to me and say their grandchildren are fed up with today’s cartoons, but they love the simplicity of Mr Benn, the fact that he’s very moral, always sorting out people’s problems – including dragons.”Brooks went on to appear in a host of different primetime television shows including ITV’s Coronation Street, in which he played Norman Phillips, and EastEnders, where he played Joe Macer, who memorably killed his wife, the long-running character Pauline Fowler.Brooks also starred in the BBC comedy drama Big Deal, which followed gambler Robbie Box as he tried to make a living by betting while also trying to maintain his relationship with Jan, played by Sharon Duce.Brooks earned a number of film credits, including a role in The Knack … And How To Get It, which won the 1965 Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival.A year later he starred in Ken Loach’s Cathy Come Home, a BBC drama filmed like a documentary, which explored the impact of Britain’s housing shortage in the late 1960s. In 2000, a British Film Institute poll of 100 industry figures rated it as the second-best British television programme ever made, after Fawlty Towers.Press Association contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionSoap operaDramanewsShareReuse this content"

A pandemic has since occurred and, appropriately perhaps, The Adversary begins on a dark note of contagion. “There was a killing sickness on the shore that winter and the only services at the church were funerals,” runs the opening line, setting the tone for a book that plumbs the depths of depravity but – thanks to its energy, and its ripe and adventurous language – never loses a black sense of humour. Having now won the 30th annual Dublin Literary award, worth €100,000, The Adversary is proof that Crummey is beginning to garner the accolades he deserves beyond his native Canada.Crummey hails from Newfoundland; all six of his novels are set there. He understands the power of lashing sea, scouring wind, an eked-out existence far from what many consider to be civilisation. In The Innocents he told a kind of Adam-and-Eve story of two children left alone to raise themselves in a shack in the early years of the 19th century. Supplies are occasionally brought in a ship called the Hope; its black-clad captain is known as the Beadle.There is no need to read The Innocents to enjoy The Adversary, but it’s a pleasure to spot the connection. The new novel is set in a town called Mockbeggar, and the Beadle is one of its itinerant grandees. This is the Canadian frontier, the harried edge of wilderness, though in comparison with the world of The Innocents the municipality’s physical comforts seem positively Parisian.Despite the prevalence of funerals, the reader encounters a wedding in the novel’s opening pages. It is between a trembling girl, Anna Morels, brought over from far-off Jersey, and Abe Strapp, one of the grandees of Mockbeggar, the two syllables of his name landing like blows. “He was a fright for a child to look upon as a prospective husband, bacon-faced, with a small full mouth that gave him the air of a greedy infant.” He turns out to be worse than a greedy infant – Strapp is a brutal tyrant whose violent whims are the scourge of Mockbeggar.Crummey has built nuanced portraits of allegiances forged in adversity, and enmities that arrive from scarce resourcesThe marriage will not, in fact, take place: as in a gothic tale, an impediment is presented when another girl, Imogen Purchase, is revealed to have been impregnated by Strapp – or at least such testimony is given – and she becomes his forlorn bride. Neither girl’s fate is enviable. If you ever entertained romantic ideas of what it might be like to live in a wild and isolated place in centuries past, Crummey’s work will disabuse you of such idle fancy.The book’s true mechanism, however, is the rivalry between Strapp and a woman we first meet as the Widow Caines. I am not the first critic to note that, like The Innocents, The Adversary plays on another story in Genesis, that of Cain and Abel; later in the book we find a kind of trinity, too, in the three young people who are the leavening element of goodness and go by the resonant names of Solemn, Bride and Lazarus.The novel’s blurb compares it to Deadwood, David Milch’s brilliant HBO series from the early 00s. It is an apt analogy, and not only because both present a portrait of a society forged under duress. Plot doesn’t, strictly speaking, drive the tale. Rather, Crummey and Milch alike have built nuanced portraits of the allegiances that must be forged in adversity, and the enmities that arrive not only from longstanding hatreds but from scarce resources too.And, like Milch, Crummey luxuriates in vivid swearing and slang. The Widow Caines dresses in her late husband’s clothes to run her business – she dismisses a skirt as a “fucksail”. The madam of the whorehouse, known as the Abbess, refers to the use to which the servant’s room in her domicile has been put: “‘The blanket hornpipe,’ she said. ‘The goat’s jig. Clicket. Making feet for children’s stockings.’” In his acknowledgments the author bows to the 1811 edition of Francis Grose’s Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, now freely available online for all to peruse.

Entering the apartment, out of the Mediterranean sun, visitors would need a minute to adjust to the dimness, gradually perceiving faded curtains and heavy furniture, every surface covered with antiques and whimsical objects. There was no electricity, only candlelight. The host, proffering morsels of bread and cheese from the shadows, was an older man with “enigmatic eyes” beneath round spectacles – the poet Constantine Cavafy.What kind of person might be discerned amid the gloom? This is what Peter Jeffreys and Gregory Jusdanis set out to discover in their deeply researched and engaging biography, the first for 50 years. They brilliantly recreate his world – two chapters about Alexandria are especially good – and investigate his place within it. Cavafy, whose admirers and champions included WH Auden, EM Forster, David Hockney and Jackie Onassis, has remained enigmatic since his death at 70 in 1933. Surprisingly, for a poet who never sold a book in his lifetime – and instead circulated broadsheets, pamphlets and sewn notebooks, building his reputation poem by poem – he now has “a global audience he could never have imagined”, thanks to poems such as The City, Waiting for the Barbarians and Ithaca, which Onassis asked to be read at her funeral.Born in Alexandria in 1863, Constantine lost his father aged seven. His mother, Haricleia, moved the family to England, with periods in Liverpool and London. A short-lived return to Alexandria, curtailed by the British bombardment of the city in 1882, was followed by three years in Istanbul, Constantine’s “urban finishing school”, where he may have had his first sexual encounters. He returned to Alexandria for good in 1885 and published his first poem the following year. To support himself, he worked for three decades as a clerk at the office of irrigation services, a dull job for a bright mind, but one which left plenty of time and energy for his livelier imaginative life.There is no poet quite like Cavafy. His tone is terse, often ironical; his style plain, prosaic, without metaphor, simile, rhyme or rich vocabulary. He is not for everyone. Thom Gunn, writing to a friend, wondered why Cavafy had never interested him. “Is it because the translations haven’t been very good or because I feel pressures on me to like his work simply because he is homosexual?” Cavafy’s best poems have a toughness and detachment that Gunn would have liked; his worst are mired in the same sentimentality that Gunn worried he was perpetuating in his own work.Had he not become a poet, Cavafy once remarked, he would have been a historian instead. His lifelong interest in Byzantine and Hellenic history informed much of his output. He is, as Charles Simic said, “a poet of a lost world”. A poet of lost history, too. Small episodes, forgotten figures and peripheries were his subjects. Caesarion, for example, written on the eve of the first world war, shocked Cavafy’s contemporaries not only because it supposedly demonstrated his ignorance of contemporary events, but also “focus[ed] on an erotic attraction and poetic creation, linking homoeroticism and artistic inspiration”. Bored of Athens and Sparta, Cavafy reached into the lesser known, unheroic past, in search of models.There is a certain unreality to the Cavafian canon, a dreamlike or illusory quality that one cannot help but compare to Cavafy the man, standing, as Forster put it, “at a slight angle to the universe”. The young men in his poems, note his biographers, often “cross the barrier between reality and imagination”.Alexandria, too, shimmers there and threatens to dissolve. Some of his contemporaries criticised Cavafy for eschewing realist descriptions, but he understood, as Jeffreys and Jusdanis write, that “his work’s emotional energy lay in evocations, dreams, allusions and feelings”. Moments from urban life – an attractive shop assistant, the “momentary brush” against him – lend sensual and erotic energy to his compositions. But cosmopolitan Alexandria was also a town of curtain-twitchers and keyhole-snoopers, and Cavafy – fearing social rejection and exile from the city he loved – became more discreet and conventional. “Acknowledging homosexuality in his poetry and censoring himself in life,” the authors suggest, “actually inspired and ‘sustained’ his poetry.”The challenges for biographers are manifold: a lack of surviving letters, an “unremarkable” daily routine, an almost complete absence of information about his romantic life (for this, the poems are our main sources). Jeffreys and Jusdanis suggest that the archive may have been tampered with to remove compromising material, both by Cavafy himself and by his executors, Alekos and Rika Sengopoulos.For a poet whose “captivating” voice and “scintillating” conversation have been widely praised, his surviving letters are mostly terse and bureaucratic. Thanking Forster, a good friend and tireless supporter, for sending A Passage to India, Cavafy wrote merely: “It is an admirable work. It is delightful reading. I like the style. I like the characters. I like the presentation of the environment.”Such obstacles necessitate an unconventional structure, and Jeffreys and Jusdanis eschew the standard birth-to-death narrative. (To compensate for the “hollowness” of the archive and the “deep absence of information”,Jusdanis wrote in 2018, “a biographer of Cavafy has to work like a novelist, conjecturing and recreating scenes, filling in the gaps”.) We begin and end with Cavafy’s death and are given, in between, “a circular narrative through various thematic sequences”– discrete chapters, that is, about Cavafy’s family, friends, city, poetry and his obsessive attempts to launch and secure his literary reputation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionDespite the paucity of material, much is revealed here: Cavafy’s “gargantuan aspirations, a monastic focus on his craft, and a loveless existence”. Eventually, “the self-interested, self-involved poet of middle age” seems to win out over “the warm, loving, affectionate young man”. Yet he remains sphinx-like, just out of reach, and we are left sympathising with the many guests he received in his dusky, eccentric apartment, like the Greek poet Myrtiotissa, who “felt the whole visit had an air of unreality” and, descending the stairs back into sultry, clamorous Alexandria, began to doubt whether she had seen and spoken to him at all.Michael Nott is the author ofThom Gunn: A Cool Queer Life(Faber).

Phones are banned, so the images are often fuzzy and blurred, clips ending abruptly – sometimes with a hiss of “Hide the phone!” or “The guard is coming!”. At times, it can be hard to make sense of what is happening on screen. The voiceover is spoken by Karina Sánchez, who spent more than six years in prison, and she also voices the experiences of other incarcerated women. It’s not immediately clear she is telling multiple stories, however, so the voiceover becomes mildly disorientating.It’s estimated that 95% of women in Chile’s prisons are mothers, and their children can stay with them in jail until they turn two years old. A woman describes staying awake all night the night before her son left, watching him sleep (she had 10 years to serve of her sentence). Mums tell painful stories of losing contact with their children once they leave; one received a notification from the family court that her children had been taken into foster care, relinquished by her sister.Film-maker Tana Gilbert collected the footage for her 74-minute film over six years; the title is Spanish for “badly loved” or “unloved” women. One prisoner describes having to give birth in a hospital in handcuffs, after the doctor refused to believe she wasn’t high on drugs (“All you prison bitches are into drugs”). There are funny moments, too, including clips of women frantically exercising after a fitness craze gripped the prison.We never find out what crimes the women were convicted of, which feels respectful, but there’s little wider context either, of the poverty and inequality that drive up Chile’s female prison population. In the end, the film remains opaque and elusive in ways that audiences (particularly outside the country) might find frustrating.Malqueridas is on True Stories from 15 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsChilePrisonsWomenAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

When her grandmother Júlia died, she left behind a treasure trove of letters, written between 1946 and 1957 when she was living inMozambique, then under Portuguese colonial rule. Read out by actor Rita Durão, this correspondence captures the hopes and dreams of a young woman, newly married and adapting to a foreign land. The voiceover is paired with Ruivo’s footage of present-day, independent Mozambique, images that breathe a second life into these messages from the past.The juxtaposition between Júlia’s writings and the Mozambican cityscapes recallsChantal Akerman’s seminal News from Home (1978), in which Akerman combined her narration of her mother’s letters with languid shots of New York City to reveal the intricacies of the mother-daughter relationship and the rhythm of urban living. My Grandmother Trelotótó doesn’t quite achieve such cinematic alchemy. Júlia’s letters, while seemingly benevolent, betray a colonial gaze that erases the hardships endured by the local population (a fact acknowledged by Ruivo in an artist’s statement). The way Mozambique is framed – quotidian scenes full of anonymous faces – appears merely illustrative; it does little to complicate or push against Júlia’s problematised point of view.The lethargy of the Mozambique section is countered by video glimpses of Júlia’s final years back inPortugal, also shot by Ruivo. Here is where the film feels most reviving; these moments take in the older woman as she is, curious, active, and full of vitality. Ruivo also pays close attention to the rituals of rural life: painstaking scenes of dough being kneaded, and meal preparation. The documentary portrait could have turned into a protracted elegy if not for these sequences, which are filled with a dynamism more powerful than words.My Grandmother Trelotótó is at the ICA, London, from 15 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPortugalMozambiqueColonialismFamily filmsAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

And that’s only 10 minutes into Brando Topp’s directing debut, in which Mika (Mia Danelle) is rocking out to gnarly sounds on her headphones when her body is hijacked by an alien soundwave that was formerly stuck in space listening to the vibrations coming from Earth.That Alien, Sound plays out like a lo-fi LA sweding of The Man Who Fell to Earth. Stupefied at having a body, the wave – later dubbed Sound – bugs Shannon by chucking tissues around the car and trying to grab the steering wheel. Back at her bewildered parents’ house, she marvels at the five senses and, excited by a fried breakfast, burns herself on the pan. Her brother Deyo (Deyo Forteza) takes her to his band’s jam session; a chance for the once-disembodied oscillation to be in the presence of real live music.This cosmic body-swap scenario is infuriatingly loose, with no obvious reason for the soundwave gimmick other than the innate kookiness. Self-infatuated scenes sprawl out for too long with all the discipline of an Echo Park hipster improv group after a long night on the edibles. Sound, indignant at what she finds on terra firma, is increasingly gripped by outraged soliloquies about climate change and human megalomania; these are the kind of trite interventions that give wokeness a bad name.But matters do pick up in the film’s final phase, as Sound, Shannon and Deyo head to a music festival to make a radio transmission that they hope will bring Mika back. As the story coalesces around her and Shannon’s failing relationship, the alien conceit starts to make more sense in terms of a strangeness in his partner he feels threatened by, and the new identity she is seeking. Even some of the heavy quirk – turning up at the jamboree cosplaying as Mozart – starts to seem charming as Topp’s directing locks into place around actual themes. It goes to show: inside every annoyingly tricksy indie comedy is a decent road movie trying to get out.That Alien, Sound is on digital platforms from 18 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Not long out of high school, the best friend with whom she planned to start a business died in a car accident. Then her elder sister, Megan Henneberg, was murdered in 2007 by her husband Brian, leaving Chelli, her parents, siblings and extended family to deal with the harrowing loss.And yet, no matter how much sympathy you might feel for Chelli and her family’s trauma, or interest you might have in her bagmaking skills, or engagement with her as a person, somehow those core components don’t coalesce to make this feature-length documentary feel vital or even especially necessary. A self-described introvert, Chelli herself is a pretty opaque figure although she speaks quite expressively and intelligently about her approach to design. We only get tiny glimpses of her home life with husband David, so she’s not really developed as a “character” sufficiently to carry the film.Meanwhile, the story around her sister’s murder has something of a shroud around it, which is understandable to an extent, but then turns the film into a strange fan dance, alternating revelation with concealment about the facts of the case. In the end, the fact that Chelli found a way to forgive her brother-in-law in a religious sense, seems to be the big takeaway, but the wafty haziness around the whole issue reduces the murder to a brutal but incidental noise off-screen.The most engaging parts of the film are the scenes where Chelli is at work at her fancy industrial Juki sewing machine in her alarmingly tidy, sepulchre-white studio. The hum of the machinery is as seductively lulling as an ASMR video and watching Chelli buy leather hides is pure shopping pornography. Even more visually lush is the sequence where Chelli goes off to Florence to take a course in leatherwork and design to refine her skills, offering the film-makers a chance to shoot one of the world’s more photogenic cities at crepuscular times of the day. All of which makes the surprise ending even more baffling, denying viewers the redemption–through–small-business-ownership ending the film appears to be striving for.Dawn Dusk is on digital platforms from 15 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsHandbagsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Bookended by vivid depictions of the sea, it also brought the chance to hear a piece inspired by a very different body of water: The Rose Lake,Michael Tippett’s swansong, completed by the 88-year-old composer in 1993.The Rose Lake was written after Tippett visitedLake Retbain Senegal, where a particular kind of algae turns the water pink. Spare, translucent music links thickly textured episodes that evoke the idea of the lake itself singing through the day – a slow, expansive melody that changes yet remains essentially the same. It’s not often performed – partly because of the demands on the percussionists and the sheer amount of hardware it requires to create Tippett’s otherworldly soundscape. Ranged along the back of the Albert Hall stage, next to every other percussion instrument you can think of, was a long line of three dozenrototoms: tuned drums a bit like miniature timpani. Two of the LPO’s percussionists darted back and forth along this line, arms whirling and sticks flying, looking from a distance like panicked spiders but hitting their marks to weave gossamer melodic effects. Even if the piece itself has the occasional longueur, it sounded glorious here as conducted by Edward Gardner.Ravel’s song cycle Shéhérazade, conjuring up an imagined, exotic Asia, marked the Proms debut of the recently anointed star mezzo-sopranoAigul Akhmetshina. Her singing shone, riding above the orchestra with seeming ease; and yet for all this power she seemed more the wide-eyed innocent than the indulgent dreamer. Perhaps in this huge hall a more operatic approach would have captured more of the songs’ sensuousness. The orchestra, however, had this covered, here and throughout, Gardner blending sonorities seamlessly with forensic attention to detail. Sibelius’s 1914 tone poem The Oceanides evoked both far horizons and a sense of fairytale; the first movement of Debussy’s La Mer went from uneasy, tense dawn music to a midday blaze. The best music about the sea is not just waves and water but time, space and, above all, light.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

As a player who previously worked as a bookseller, and currently is a novelist, I am poised to be extremely stressed out by a game set in a mobile bookshop. However, Tiny Bookshop is crafted with such care and balance that I found myself losing hours to the gentle pace and tiny puzzles and sheer escapism of the world it presents.The setup is simple, and one that is common to many games in the post Stardew Valley era of“cosy” games. You throw in your old life and open a shop selling tiny things you are passionate about to a bustling little community full of interesting characters who you progressively develop relationships with by providing them with goods and services. Days, weeks and seasons pass, the world grows richer and more interesting around you, the stakes rise and fall, a tiny economy evolves from your business.View image in fullscreenA lush, lived-in community … Tiny Bookshop.Photograph: Neoludic GamesHowever, what is different this time is that you are not selling farmed goods as in Stardew Valley, or tea as in Spirittea orWanderstop, or, in the case of Spiritfarer, shepherding dying souls to the other side via your floating bed and breakfast. You’re selling books. Actual books. From Wilde and Shakespeare and Woolf and Agatha Christie all the way through to Toni Morrison and John Green and Holly Black, you are providing the inhabitants of a sleepy seaside and university town with books that are recognisable and real. Every book that you stock in your little trailer shop is, to my knowledge, a real one.Now, this will place some players at an advantage – if you’re a reader, selling books to people will come easily. You won’t need to study the flavour text to compare books the customers like with books you have in stock: if they’re looking for something scary, romantic, and historical, Carmilla ticks all the boxes. You’ll know what graphic novels feel a little heady, or which ones are for a more casual reader.This feels to me like a rare game made with readers in mind: the puzzle of finding which books suit which customer’s request comes quite quickly, even if the in-game algorithm sometimes didn’t match my personal taste. I think The Great Gatsby would appeal to a customer looking for philosophical fiction, but the game doesn’t. Like working in an actual bookshop, there are genres and categories that serve a watertight function; unlike working in a bookshop, personal taste doesn’t come into it. However, Tiny Bookshop is adept at teaching you its rules, and recommending the wrong title doesn’t come at a high cost. The stakes aren’t too steep. There is no real way to lose.Cosy video games are on an unstoppable rise. Will they unleash a darker side?Read moreI played using the touchscreen on my Steam Deck, which I found deeply pleasing and responsive compared to using the buttons, which were a little tricky. Decorating my tiny bookshop was great: discovering I could acquire a shop dog was a real joy. The local characters are quite a serious bunch and hold some old dramas and pathos – there is a sense of a lush, lived-in community unravelling secrets and context as the seasons pass by. It is the first new game I’ve found myself truly relaxing into in quite some time: the gameplay is rhythmic and mellow, and, dare I say it, genuinely cosy. Tiny Bookshop provides players with a job that doesn’t feel like a job but a lovely escape into words and stories.Tiny Bookshop is out nowExplore more on these topicsGamesIndie gamesRole playing gamesSimulation gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

As I stood knee-deep in the cool Atlantic Ocean, marvelling at the beauty and emptiness of the Plage de Port Lin, I decided this was nonsense: without this little detour, “just to have a look”, I’d never have discovered Le Croisic, on the Guérande peninsula. The downside is that time isn’t on my side: it’s past 5pm and I’m supposed to be at the big resort, La Baule-Escoublac, six miles east by now. But thepresqu’île(a “nearly island”), as the French call it, tucked in the corner where Brittany meets Pays de la Loire, is calling out to be explored.First, though, a late afternoon dip in the sea is too hard to resist, and I wade into the water, sharing a delighted smile with fellow swimmers. Two elderly women in flowery swimming caps nod a cheery “Bonsoir” as I take my first strokes. Afterwards, I wander up the coast a little way. A row of belle epoque villas overlook the rocky coastline, and I climb down on to the sand in front of them to look west at the enchanting view of the small headlands jutting into the sea and scattered black rocks in silhouette.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian GraphicsBack in the car, I hazard that I have just enough time to do a circuit of the peninsula if I delay my evening dinner reservation in La Baule, and so I follow the coast road west, spottingmenhirs, small sandy coves and a golf course along the way. As I approach the town of Le Croisic, there are more people out for a stroll beneath the towering maritime pine trees and I park up again to join them for a while.At the jetty that usually sees passengers boarding thefoot ferryto the islands off the coast, such as Belle-Île-en-Mer and Hoëdic, I notice a crowd of people aren’t queueing, but fishing. Old men and teenage boys are peering over the railings, with nets lowered down on lines; there’s a jolly camaraderie and their chatter carries on the breeze.View image in fullscreenOne of Le Croisic’s squares.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyIn the sea behind them, I spot the Trehic jetty, an 850-metre stone pier that snakes into the bay nearby – its end point marked by a lighthouse – as well as the tip of the Pen Bron peninsula on the other side of the bay, which seems so close it could be within swimming distance. Its proximity reminds me what the two peninsulas embrace: 2,000 hectares (4,940 acres) of marshland and the salt ponds from which the famous Guérande salt crystals are harvested. The thought of sprinkling it on my dinner makes my stomach rumble, and so I head on to La Baule, taking a detour through the main town, along the pretty harbour front with its yachts and quaysides.After checking into theHotel des Dunes, I wander out for dinner. There’s a holiday vibe in the town and restaurants are full of families and friends dining together, black-clad waiters whirling between them with trays aloft. I arrive for my reservation atRestaurant Le M(starter, main course and dessert from €18.90), and tuck into briny oysters from Brittany and grilled fish with Mediterranean vegetables.There’s a holiday vibe with restaurants full of families  dining together, black-clad waiters whirling between them with trays aloftLa Baule-Escoublac first welcomed tourists in the late 19th century, after the opening of the railway line, and became a sophisticated resort. Today, it is a mix of modern apartments, belle epoque-era timber-framed architecture, cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops. Away from the main drags are desirable 19th-century villas shaded by the cypress and pines that were planted in the early 1820s to stabilise the dunes. It is undeniably touristy, but that’s no surprise for a place with such a good beach.The next morning, I wander down to the seafront and inhale the ozone before wandering along the shore, sitting for a while on the golden sand.Some 15 minutes north of La Baule-Escoublac is impressive Guérande – its name familiar from the eponymous salt – with its mighty walls, towers, moats and grand medieval gate,La Porte Saint-Michel. Inside, it is a delight: bunting flutters above streets packed with bakeries, arty boutiques and creperies.View image in fullscreenThe mighty walls and grand gate, La Porte Saint-Michel, in the medieval town of Guérande.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyThe sun is shining, so I take a table in the main square on the terrace of the creperie Chez Lucien and soon I’m tucking into a crispy goldengalette complète, with ham, cheese and a gooey egg at its centre, and a cup of cider. I might strictly be in the region of Pays de la Loire, but the identity here is resolutely Breton, and the salt harvested from the nearby marshes has been a key ingredient in Brittany’s famous salted butter for centuries.To find out more about the fascinating process of harvesting thesel de Guérande, I head out to the marshes. At the shop and visitor centre of theTerre de Selcooperative (salt marsh tours from €10.50), I meet Simon Pereon, apaludieror salt harvester, who has agreed to show me how he and his 220 fellowpaludiersenact the process of salt harvesting between June and September. Salt has been prized in these parts since Roman times, when soldiers were sometimes paid in salt (hence the origin of the word salary), but the marshes as we see them today date from around 1,000 years ago.As we drive to Simon’s ponds, I start to see the appeal of working under the big skies and open air, and the reason he followed in his father’s and grandfather’s footsteps. “The government classes us as ‘farmers’,” he explains, “but we work with seawater and the whole landscape is balanced between the land and the sea.” With a long, toothless rake called alas, he moves the seawater between a labyrinth of shallow rectangular ponds that don’t drain, due to the clay mud beneath, coloured pink by the algae that thrives here. As the water moves between each pond it becomes increasingly concentrated as the sun evaporates the water and leaves the salt behind.View image in fullscreen‘Big skies and open air’ – Marais Salants de Guérande.Photograph: Hilke Maunder/AlamySimon sweeps thelasacross the ponds and the water ripples gently: the process is hypnotic. By the end of each day, he has raked the salt into neat piles on the dykes between ponds. “In summer, we harvest 50kg every day. The job has evolved over the years, with tractors and other machines, but for the actual salt harvesting, we still use the identical process that’s been around for centuries.”The tranquillity has been passed down the ages: I hear little more than the calls from the avocets and ibis in the neighbouring lagoon. “I start at daybreak,” Simon says, “and for the first few hours of the day, I see the sun rise, listen to the birds, and there’s no one around. At the end of the day, too, I just watch the sun go down.”The tranquillity has been passed down the ages: I hear little more than the calls from the avocets and ibis in the lagoonIt sounds like bliss and, after I take another detour later that day through the salt marshes – the clouds in the reddening sky are reflected in the mirror-like ponds – I am reassured that curiosity can only be a good thing.The trip was provided byPays de la Loire Tourism; accommodation provided byHotel des Dunesin La Baule (doublesfrom €65room-only).Brittany Ferrieshas crossings from Portsmouth to St Malo from£229return for a car and two people, including en suite cabin on the outward, overnight legAmuse Bouche: How to Eat Your Way Around France by Carolyn Boyd is publishedby Profile, £10.99.

If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend that you do, and not just for the iconic spiked gazpacho scene. This version is also spiked, but more tamely with watermelon, which lends a wonderful sweetness. You can go as simple or as extra as you like with the toppings: I, of course, like to go extra with cherry tomatoes of varying colours, ice cubes, micro basil, finely cubed cucumber and a swirl of my best extra-virgin olive oil to finish.Watermelon and tomato gazpacho with rosemary croutonsGreen pepper haters, you really must include a quarter of one here – it adds the necessary slight bitterness to offset the sweet tomatoes and watermelon.Prep20 minCook20 minChill1 hr+Serves4-6For the gazpacho350g cherry vine tomatoes650g roughly cut fresh watermelon, rind and seeds removed150g cucumber½ small red onion2 smallgarlic cloves¼green pepper5 slices good-quality white bread, challahideally60ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for serving1tsp sea salt flakesFor the croutons5 slices good-quality whitebread,again, challah ideally, cut into 1½cm cubes1½tbsp olive oil½tsp sea salt flakesTips of 6 rosemary sprigsTo serve (all optional)Halved cherry tomatoes– a mix of yellow and orange looks niceDiced strawberriesFinely chopped cucumberIce cubesSprigs of roasted rosemaryHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. For the croutons, tip the cubed bread into a baking tray with the oil, sea salt and rosemary, mix well to coat, then roast for 20 minutes, until golden brown and crisp.Meanwhile, tip all the gazpacho ingredients into a food processor and blitz smooth. (I hate to add an extra step, but if you transfer this in batches to a high-speed blender and blitz again, you will get more soup and less pulp after the sieving process.)Strain the soup in batches through a coarse sieve into a clean bowl – use a wooden spoon and really push all the liquid through, leaving the bits of pepper skin and tomato seeds in the sieve. Once all the gazpacho has been sieved, chill the lot in the fridge for at least an hour.Serve in shallow bowls topped with your choice of halved cherry tomatoes, diced strawberries, finely chopped cucumber and ice, along with the croutons and rosemary sprigs. Drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil and serve immediately.Explore more on these topicsSoupQuick and easySummer food and drinkSpanish food and drinkFoodFruitVegetablesVegan food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
