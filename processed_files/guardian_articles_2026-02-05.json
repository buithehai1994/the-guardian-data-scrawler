After theGuardian’s writers nominated theirs– including Ramsgate in Kent, Falmouth in Cornwall, Abergavenny in Monmouthshire and Portobello in Edinburgh – we asked readers which UK towns they would put forward.Hastings, East SussexView image in fullscreen‘Culture is woven into everyday life’ … the 2024 Jack in the Green parade in Hastings.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersCulture in Hastings grows out of the shingle and the wind and the friction between past and present. You can feel it in the fishing fleet hauled up on the beach, still part of daily life, and then a short walk away in bold contemporary spaces showing work that speaks far beyond the town. It shows up in events that belong to the people who live there; Jack in the Green spilling through the streets; Pirate Day turning the whole place into a shared act of play; music competitions that quietly bring international talent into a town that never pretends to be grand.There is youth culture that is visible and unapologetic, from skate culture to artists and musicians building scenes without waiting for permission. Naming Hastings as UK town of culture would recognise a place where culture is already woven into everyday life and where investment would deepen something authentic, rooted and alive rather than trying to invent it.David Shopland, LondonGlastonbury, SomersetView image in fullscreen‘Something here for everybody’ … Brad Crowley, Glastonbury town crier.Photograph: Guardian CommunityMy calendar as Glastonbury town crier is packed with events attended by thousands of people, from the ecstatic revelry of Beltane in May, to the emergence of the red and white dragons twice a year to battle for the season, to theGoddess Conference, pilgrimages from church denominations across the globe and academic lectures on occultism coexisting side by side. There are hundreds of other such parades and gatherings throughout the year, and you can climb the Tor to marvel at the splendid views across the Somerset Levels – it’s one of the most stunning sights in the country.The high street and side alleys are filled with independent businesses, with hardly a chain brand to be seen (aside from the Co-op, which sells local produce such as cider and ales brewed within the town). From esoteric bookshops, crystal merchants, leatherworkers, blacksmiths, comic bookshops, record stores and clothing, there is something here for everybody. I’ve never lived anywhere with such a robust and resilient community that genuinely looks out for one another.Brad Crowley, 36, GlastonburyKirkcudbright, Dumfries and GallowayView image in fullscreen‘Like strolling through a painting’ … the garden at Broughton House in Kirkcudbright.Photograph: Simon Whaley Landscapes/AlamyKirkcudbright at the mouth of the River Dee is known as theartists’ town. There are lots of galleries, including a national-level collection, with a range of high quality exhibitions of paintings, prints and ceramics. EA Hornel, one of the “Glasgow boys” group, was raised in Kirkcudbright, and his home, studio and beautiful garden are open to the public. Many other Glasgow boys and girls visited and worked in the town too.The harbour and marina, and the streets of pastel painted houses, with glimpses down alleyways of hidden gardens, make any walk a stroll through a painting. The town centre is packed with a range of open air fairs during the summer – steampunk, anyone? – and the fish and chips from the van beside the harbour is delicious. When the tide is right, wander along to the park at the edge of the town and watch the boats sailing off to the sea. And breathe easy.Anne Clark, Menstrie, ClackmannanshireNorth Shields, Tyne and WearView image in fullscreen‘Import and export of talent’ … North Shields Fish Quay.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PANorth Shields is a small port built 800 years ago on fishing and shipbuilding, which celebrates its heritage yet embraces new ways.

To be officially seen and celebrated as a town of culture would further ensure the import and export of talent through businesses and individuals who see culture and creativity as core values of society.Mark, 62, North ShieldsIpswich, SuffolkView image in fullscreenJack Clarke celebrates scoring for Ipswich Town football club, which has supported the bid for 2029 city of culture.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAAs theoldest continuously inhabited town in England, Ipswich would be the ideal first town of culture in the UK. With its population of around 140,000 and location within easy distance of many other East Anglian towns, the impact would ripple out to other places, not only creating a social and economic benefit for the town itself but also acting as a catalyst to a large area in need of regeneration and motivation.Ipswich and the surrounding area is the birthplace of, among other notable figures, Thomas Wolsey andJohn Constable, and the town has a wealth of cultural landmarks, including its historical waterfront, Christchurch park and mansion, theNew Wolsey theatre,Red Rose Chain theatre,Eastern Angles theatre companyandDanceEast, to name but a few. Music, art and the spoken word all flourish – though often with insufficient financial and community support. Ipswich Town football club is supporting Ipswich’s bid to become the 2029 city of culture, and Ed Sheeran has been linked to the bid – another local lad. Becoming a town of culture would provide the funding to enable far more people to become involved in community events and have a lasting benefit on the whole area.Jacqueline Robson, IpswichScarborough, North YorkshireView image in fullscreen‘A warm heart’ … chalets on the beach at Scarborough.Photograph: Peter Scholey/AlamyI am nominating Scarborough: it’s bursting with art galleries, theatres, libraries, museums and cinemas, and hosts a packed calendar of festivals and fairs. Live music is everywhere – from music and spoken word evenings in bars and cafes, and buskers on the streets, right up to theOpen Air theatre, which hosts a stellar lineup of international artists.The streets of the town are filled with independent shops, bars, restaurants and businesses, plus lots of local crafters, creatives and produce in the market hall. There’s street art, public art and murals, historical buildings and traditional events. If you fancy some peace and quiet, visit the endless forests, moorland, cliffs and beaches. Stop and watch out for the dolphins, who are regular visitors along the coast.Scarboroughis a bit worn here and there, like many seaside towns, but there’s a deep sense of place, pride and community spirit – a warm heart.Dianne, ScarboroughDevizes, WiltshireView image in fullscreenJulie Christie in 1967’s Far from the Madding Crowd, which filmed in Devizes.Photograph: MGM/Studiocanal/AllstarDevizes has so much going for it. It’s a beautiful townscape, which includes the famous pond, the Crammer (supposedly the location of the Moonraker smuggling legend), and the surrounding green. There are lovely old buildings, an internationally renowned museum, an art deco cinema undergoing restoration, theWharf theatreand theDevizes arts festival. Themusic academyteaches, puts on musicals, runs the Big Sound choir (which I sing in) and organises the fabulousFulltone music festivalevery year. And there are lots of independent shops and galleries. The Kennet and Avon canal runs through the town, including the Caen Hill flight of 29 locks which were restored by volunteers and reopened by the queen in 1990.Devizes was the home of 18th-century portrait artist Thomas Lawrence (theLawrence Art Society, which exhibits in the Georgian town hall, is named after him) and was used as a location in the 1967 film adaptation of Thomas Hardy’s Far from the Madding Crowd. It’s surrounded by beautiful vistas and landscapes, including Roundway Hill, which features bronze age barrows, an iron age hill fort known as Oliver’s Castle, a Romano-British water shrine, a civil war battlefield and the coach road from London to Bath. The town itself was founded by the Normans in the 11th century, although the castle fell into ruin and was rebuilt in Victorian times. It’s a vibrant place to live, and I think it thoroughly deserves to be the UK town of culture.Pam Thomas, 73, Devizes, WiltshireCaernarfon, GwyneddView image in fullscreen‘One of the best in Europe – even if it’s a symbol of oppression’ … Caernarfon castle.Photograph: Joel Goodman/the GuardianCaernarfon is home to a world heritage site in the area with thehighest percentage of Welsh speakers.

Caernarfon is home to one of the largest freefood festivalsin Wales and has a thriving music scene that incorporates everything from folk to rock, choir singing to brilliant songwriters. There is a fantastic arts festival calledGŵyl Arall (Another Festival), which has contributors arriving from far and wide to a long weekend of literature and song every summer.We have one of thebest medieval castlesin Europe – even though it is thought of as a symbol of oppression and subjugation locally, it attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors to the town.

No redemption on offer.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/ReutersThe politics sketchPoliticsMr Rules hits tipping point as Mandelson proves the one mistake that can’t be undoneJohn CraceThere is a look of despair in Starmer’s eyes – and a feeling in the room that the endgame has begunThu 5 Feb 2026 10.59 ESTLast modified on Thu 5 Feb 2026 16.12 ESTShareIt’s beginning to feel terminal. Not that there hasn’t been talk of Labour MPs wanting to removeKeir Starmerbefore. Just that this time there’s the sense of a tipping point being reached. No more second chances. No praying for a miracle that will never come in the May elections. A quantum shift of collective despair.You can’t escape the irony. Starmer has always prided himself on being Mr Rules. It’s how he got elected. He might be a bit dull and lack charisma, but you can count on him to be reliable. To play by the rules. And now he has been undone by having given the prime Washington job to a man who was the epitome of Mr No Rules. And he had thought he had been so clever by acting out of character to makePeter Mandelsonthe US ambassador. Many in his cabinet had congratulated him, as had many Tories. A sleazy diplomat for a sleazy president. A match made in heaven.But what was done cannot be undone. This is one mistake that can’t be put right. The sacking of Mandelson last September was necessary but far too little. Mandy was a binary choice. No redemption on offer. No apologies, or promises to cut the cost of living in the coming year, would do. Starmer had been weighed in the balance by his own party and found wanting. Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin.There was a look of despair in Starmer’s eyes as he made his way to the podium at the Horntye Park sports club in Hastings. He was there to make yet another attempt to relaunch himself in 2026 – this time to talk about community values – but he knew this would, like all the others, be dead in the water. No one would remember a word of what he said about the Pride in Place initiative. All anyone wanted to hear about was Mandelson. The group of Labour supporters in the room gave the prime minister a sympathetic clap. Like a football crowd giving a minute’s applause in memory of an ex-player who has recently died.View image in fullscreenNo one would remember a word of what he said about the Pride in Place initiative. All anyone wanted to hear about was Mandelson.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/PAStarmer tried to address the Mandelson situation directly. He, Keir, had come in to politics late. He believed in public service. He wanted to make the country a better place for all. You couldn’t argue with that. Other politicians, such as Peter Mandelson, were just in it for themselves. This would be the first of many times that Keir’s argument collapsed in on itself under the weight of its own contradictions. A form of entropy. Because yes, we all knew that Mandy was that type of politician. He had proved it time and again while in office during the New Labour years. So always the question remained: why did you give him the job?We moved on to a slightly revisionist history of Mandelson’s appointment. “I had wanted to say this at PMQs yesterday,” Starmer confided. “But I was conscious of not wanting to compromise any future police investigation.” Presumably at some time in the past 24 hours he has decided he’s less bothered about the Old Bill’s inquiries. It was like this, said Keir. Yes, he had known Mandy andJeffrey Epsteinhad vaguely known each other at some point, but during the vetting and security clearance procedures, Mandelson had lied through his teeth. And when the extent of their relationship became clear, he had fired him.Except it just can’t have been anything like that. Because long before Mandy got the job it was common knowledge that he was in contact with Epstein and staying in his flat after the sex offender had been convicted of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution. Which should have been a red flag, disqualification immediately. You could have ended the security clearance then and there. But we’re expected to believe the security services just nodded along and ticked the right boxes when Mandy told them he had never heard of Epstein. Had no idea he was staying in a sex offender’s flat. Imagine his surprise. If this is true, Keir would have been better off getting me or any random person off the street to do the vetting. We could have told him Mandelson had always been a wrong ‘un.Starmer apologises to Epstein victims as he seeks to weather Mandelson scandalRead moreThen we got to the apology. Keir wanted to say sorry to the victims of Epstein. For having been yet another person to let them down. Though he wanted them to know it wasn’t really his fault, as he had been misled himself. Which was fine as far it goes. Certainly better than not apologising. But still a category error. Because all that Starmer had needed to do was to say no to Mandelson. A moral choice. It wasn’t even that hard a decision. But the Establishment had yet again fallen over backwards to accommodate Mandy. Even trying to wangle him the job as chancellor of Oxford University. That’s the way of the world. The right people always looked out for Peter.The main body of the speech was more of a prayer. A desire to be heard. A plea for forgiveness. Possibly even existence. But some of it rang hollow. Talk of “our values that bind us together” and the “rules that protect those in need”. Remind me. Just how did those values and rules help the victims of Epstein? It had felt very much as if the government had chosen the best interests of the government, until the shit hit the fan.Inevitably, the questions all focused on Mandelson. The BBC wondered whether the fact he had twice been forced to resign from the cabinet might not have been a clue he was unsuitable. Keir had no answer, yet again trying to claim he had had no idea of the extent of the wrongdoing. Maybe. But surely you had enough. Sky noted the anger in Starmer’s voice. You couldn’t help thinking some of this anger was better directed at himself. This one was on him. He had enough information. We all did. He could have acted differently.The Guardian’s man read out some quotes from Labour backbenchers about the prime minister’s future. You could almost see the tears in Starmer’s eyes. As if part of him also suspects the game is up. This is his tragedy. At heart he is a good man, but he has screwed up. That’s what you get for dealing with Mandelson. He will always make sure to take others down with him.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchKeir StarmerPeter MandelsonJeffrey EpsteincommentShareReuse this content"

They have quit the UK to benefit from the ultra-modern facilities on offer such as 5G telecommunications and state-of-the-art hospitals, to register their businesses, buy vast live-work spaces and trade with the rest of the world.View image in fullscreenAidan Doyle lays out his investment philosophy on YouTube – and says he misses the English countryside.Photograph: YoutubeLast year, the billionaire steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal joined a long procession of wealthy incomers, after saying he was quitting Britain for Dubai in protest against Labour’s abolition of non-dom status – a previously longstanding arrangement that allowed him to keep his wealth offshore free of UK tax.The 75-year-old, who bought a palatial home in a gated community known as the “Beverly Hills of Dubai”, was recently joined by Mukesh Ambani, often referred to as Asia’s richest person.Ambani bought one of Dubai’s most expensive home on the beachfront estate of Palm Jumeirah. The property has 10 bedrooms, Italian marble and a 70-metre private beach, and set him back $163m (£120m). As one local real estate consultant posted on TikTok: “This isn’t a home – it’s a statement.”High-profile celebrities such as the former tennis player Roger Federer and the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo have also bought expensive homes in Dubai.As a measure of the city’s popularity, figures from the international estate agent Knight Frank reveal a frenzied trade in property last year. It reported that more homes worth $2.5m to $10m were bought in Dubai than any other city in the world in the fourth quarter, ahead of New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and London.View image in fullscreenThe artificial islands of Palm Jumeirah.Photograph: Delpixart/GettyIn the $10m-plus bracket, there were 9,050 sales in Dubai compared with 6,577 in New York and 3,089 in London. In 2022, the UK capital was kingpin and sales of $10m-plus homes reached 5,826 against 4,543 in Los Angeles and 3,982 in Dubai.However, legions of middle-income fortune hunters are also swelling the 4-million population by about 200,000 a year.One of Dubai’s main attractions is zero income tax. The local government relies on sales taxes, a modest corporate tax, and substantial administration fees and charges levied by public authorities for the money to provide state services.During the pandemic Dubai became famous as a host to thousands of professionals working virtually, and for the prominent band of influencers who could dispense their advice and services against a backdrop of permanently blue skies and golden sands.While the zero tax on income played a part, so did the relatively short flight from Europe, which compares favourably with travelling to and from places such as Singapore.Professional migrants also like the strict street-crime laws, which keep Rolex and Ferrari theft to a minimum, and the relaxed attitude of the government to residencies, allowing anyone with a visa the chance to use the city as a base from which to mastermind their growing fortunes.To complete the picture, there is the hi-tech digital infrastructure, an abundance of luxury properties, 12 Michelin-starred restaurants, and a growing number of business and cultural events all year round.View image in fullscreenAnyone with a visa can use the city as a base to run their business.Photograph: Andrea Salerno Jacome/The GuardianSuch is the mix of people joining the 200,000 incomers each year that the band Madness jetted into Dubai for a gig last November, while performances of the musical Wicked will occupy the city’s opera house for much of this month. Migrants from Russia make up a large minority, hence the performance last month of the Nutcracker by the Russian State Ballet at the Zabeel theatre.Many of the 1 million or so Russian-born residents arrived after Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine. Flights between Russia and Dubai were maintained well after the war started, and the Gulf city allowed Russian incomers, as with others seeking residency, a visa in return for the purchase of a property or sizeable deposit account.Critics of Dubai say the authorities ignore money laundering, organised crime and crypto-currency trading that would not be tolerated in London or New York.The UAE government denies this and points to a move last year to deport Sean McGovern, a leader ofthe Kinahan organised crime group, which smuggles much of the cocaine that enters European markets. He was flown from the UAE to Ireland in the first extradition of its kind between the two countries.It is understood the gang’s founder, Christy Kinahan, and his sons Daniel and Christopher remain in Dubai and their children attend local international schools.The UAE has put in place financial regulations covering digital money that other jurisdictions, including London and New York, are struggling to piece together, according to the economist Brunello Rosa.Rosa, who counts many central bank executives as close contacts, recently co-wrote the bookSmart Money, which describes how digital money fits into three layers – central bank coins at the base, followed by a layer of money issued by private financial institutions and lastly, cryptocurrencies.View image in fullscreenDubai’s Global Village, a shopping, dining and entertainment complex.Photograph: Fadel Senna/AFP/GettyHe says: “So far, one of the only jurisdictions that seems to have recognised the importance of implementing this ‘pyramid’ of digital currencies is the UAE.”Nigel Green, the chief executive of the investment group deVere, says: “Dubai is what happens when a trading and commercial hub, a tax-efficient jurisdiction, and a future-focused vision all move into the same geographically advantageous location.“You’ve got a city where roughly 85-90% of residents are expatriates, all here to work, build and invest. Capital follows energy like that.”But incomers soon discover a huge disparity in pay between the richest and most other workers, says Azad Zangana, an economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, who has lived in the city for four months.“The level of disparity in pay levels is much higher than in Europe, but there is a range of housing and amenities in surrounding places that reduce the cost of living,” he says.Zangaza says traffic is the main problem across the region. That, and the summer heat, which can rise to 50C. Workers who have returned to the UK have also complained about a long-hours culture that means high pay is diluted.Doyle, an Instagram star since a series of hit videos laying out his investment philosophy, admits he misses the English countryside, but there is a nearby park and the city is becoming more family-oriented. And if he wants to see a greener environment, Oman is not far away.Talk of another property crash has failed to deter him from developing his business in Dubai. He says the demand for homes outstrips the number being built by a large margin.“Dubai sells itself the more you are here. I had a three-year plan to stay before leaving, but that doesn’t exist any more,” Doyle says.Explore more on these topicsDubaiReal estateThe super-richIncome taxBankingUnited Arab EmiratesMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our [former] songwriter and guitar player [Peter Svensson] suggested the name. We were super anglophiles. We loved British music. Our first album is called Emmerdale because the series was shown on Swedish TV every day, titled Home to the Farm. We romanticised something sort of rainy and hazy and woolly … like the cardigan.I like covers that have a new take on the original, so I really enjoyed your lounge-style version ofSabbath Bloody Sabbath. What made you choose that band [Black Sabbath] and song in particular?NotDrivingAMiniMetroWe were big fans – for a heavy band there’s a real pop sentiment in the songwriting – and I think it’s interesting when a cover is a stretch away from your natural sound. As a woman, I thought singing a song done by very manly men gave it a wonderfully creepy aspect. Ozzy [Osbourne] came to see us in Los Angeles and said it was the creepiest thing he’d ever heard, which coming from him is the biggest compliment.View image in fullscreenThe Cardigans in about 1997. From left: Peter Svensson, Nina Persson, bassist Magnus Sveningsson, keyboard player Lars-Olof Johansson and drummer Bengt Lagerberg.Photograph: Andy Willsher/RedfernsWas there something in the water inSwedenin the 90s that gave rise to the Cardigans, theWannadiesandStina Nordenstam– some of the happiest “dark” music I’ve ever heard?DomStocktonThere are a lot of takes on this – the weather, the sparseness of population – and Abba also had that thing of being happy on the surface but darker underneath. In Sweden, artistic expression was encouraged and we were helped to be creative. When you were eight or nine you were given a free recorder and then other instruments on free loans, so a poor child could play the violin without breaking the bank. Also, like in all countries, the traditional music has a sadness, a harmonic beauty with melancholia. All the kids’ TV shows we grew up with were scored by the best jazz players and musicians, so we were exposed to good quality music very early in our lives.TheCardigans’ [1995 album] Lifesounded completely different to the pop music at the time. What inspired that retro-inspired style?MartWolvesThere was a Swedish band called Eggstone who had a studio in Malmö equipped with tape recorders and an old BBC mixing desk. Everything was so aged and clunky but sounded fantastic. When we did our first album there with their producerTore Johanssonit was like a playground for us. We shed our whiny qualities and really found our shape. But when it came out it caused us a bit of trouble because everyone asked us about 60s pop and we didn’t know the references. I was into the Zombies, the Beatles and Nancy Sinatra, but for us it was more about what we could do with that style in the present.I loved the work you did withMark LinkousfromSparklehorse. What memories do you have of him or working together?GalaxyOfTheLostI had a friend crush on him. First I was a straight-up fan. Then he invited me to a concert and I couldn’t believe I had a direct line to my hero. I was really scared, but handed him my demos saying “just listen, whatever”. Then we stayed in touch and became a very odd pair of friends, age wise and culture wise, but something clicked. Musically it sure did. We both appreciated our differences. He was incredibly kind, soft and funny. We had a lovely time, but he also had that side where he was not doing so well mentally, sometimes. He had physical pain in his body and some darkness that wouldn’t leave him alone, for periods, so very early on I felt I had to help him. My husband and I had been struggling to have a baby, then two days after I learned I was finally pregnant,Mark died. It was the biggest win and the biggest loss at the same time, and then we had to perform at that really brutal funeral. I miss him a lot, but we have some of Mark’s instruments from his widow and our son’s middle name is Link, which is really nice because it keeps reminding us of Mark.Long Gone Before Daylightis one of my favourite albums everand hearing it at 14 opened my ears to a lifelong love of Americana. What had you been listening to to inspire the shift in direction?laurasnapesAmericana for sure, starting with Fleetwood Mac and the Band, who we called “beard rock”, then getting more into the wood, sea, bearded side of things. I’d already done the [Linkous-produced] A Camp record, which reflected my love of Americana, and I loved Neil Young and Dolly Parton and got deeper into country music. I was really happy that as a Swedish band the rest of the Cardigans also wanted to go in that direction. Before then, I thought sentimental music was cheesy, but I realised you have to open up to sentimentality and rawness from the heart. After the fun, ironic 90s it was a relief to think: “It’s fine. We’re human beings.”View image in fullscreenPerforming with the Manic Street Preachers at the Hultsfred festival in Sweden, 2007.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesManic Street Preachers are a famously tightly-knit band whohave worked closely together for decades. How did you find collaborating with them and were you able to bring your own input?HoppoThe songYour Love Alone Is Not Enough was already beautifully written and they just wanted my vocals. There was nothing for me to change at all, but James [Dean Bradfield, singer] came over to New York and we recorded it together, so it was really nice to be in the same room rather than just exchange digital files like many collaborations nowadays. Nicky [Wire] really liked our song Holy Love – there’s a certain recklessness, which may be why they chose me. We had a lot of fun. I love spending time with other tight-knit bands. We all understand that nature doesn’t make creators to remain in the same constellation – childhood friends staying together or whatever – so there’s something very strange and fantastic about it.You’ve worked with Tom Jones and Manic Street Preachers – what’s with the big love for Wales? Language, cuisine, or the weather?ParisDaveThere’s also Cardigan Bay [laughter]. I really like Wales, and touring withJames YorkstonI also got to dive deeply into Scotland. I really enjoy the close-knit directness of those communities. Tom Jones [with whom the Cardigans covered Talking Heads’Burning Down the House] is super sweet and had a real curiosity and joy for what we were doing. When we worked with him, his son was his manager and he brought his best childhood friend along – a bit like the Manics, in a way.View image in fullscreenAt the O2 Apollo, Manchester, in 2018.Photograph: Wenn Rights/AlamyI find your story of overcoming cancer inspiring. I live with a chronic illness (MS) and I find it’s made me more sensitive, more creative yet also more pessimistic about the future. How did illness change you?azapataUntil I was around 30 I’d hardly ever had a cold, so it was really weird at that age to face something with a possibly deathly outcome. My cancer was operable – I didn’t have to deal with chemo and stuff or get very very ill – so I’m very sorry to hear that your illness is chronic because that’s a whole different monster. I think the consolation prize for any kind of suffering is that you can appreciate things – art, for example – in a different way. You realise these things can happen to anyone. I’ve had 15 or 20 years of thinking “I’ve beaten cancer” but now I’m over 50 I’m thinking: it can totally happen to me again.It’s been20years sinceSuper Extra Gravity, my favourite album of yours.Was there something about that record that felt like it was time to stop making music ordo you have plans for any more?journowmWe were on a roll making that album and in our enthusiasm decided to make another right away. Then I started to hesitate … Throwing myself into another album and tour cycle would make me another two or three years later in trying to start a family. I said, “Actually, let’s have some time off.” Then I had to go through the cancer as well and we just dropped the ball. The main songwriter eventually lost patience, but the rest of us were excited to keep playing live. Now we have logistics issues – families, day jobs – but do toy with the idea of making new music, whether as the Cardigans or in a different form. We’re all capable of making great music and lately it’s been inspiring to see people like Suede from the 90s making new material. It’s not cringey middle-aged dudes looking hard in leather jackets. It’s really good stuff.‘Some artists thought it was too political’: can Jarvis, Damon, Olivia Rodrigo and Arctic Monkeys reboot the biggest charity album of the 90s?Read moreDid you knowNeil Hannonwas going tonamecheck youin the Divine Comedy’s songSweden?TheManWithoutFearIt was a surprise.

Ryan, who hadworkedfor seven years at the Ethereum Foundation (EF), Ethereum’s de facto governing body, suggested that Ethereum could be on the cusp of an era-defining shift.Since its founding in 2014, the foundation had prioritized technical upgrades and had avoided centralizing power while its user base was growing, but Ethereum had now grown up, and the cryptocurrency world around it had grown up, too. The EF could now “exercise a stronger voice” without compromising its ethos of decentralization, Ryan said – and he was open to leading that charge if appointed as the foundation’s new executive director.Ryan told the Guardian that he could see how political tides were changing “overnight”, which informed his proposal. In part, his thesis drew from personal experience: He’d been served by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2024, only to have the case summarily dropped, which he suspects was a pragmatic move to avoid alienating the tech sector during Joe Biden’s re-election campaign. By November, with Donald Trump poised to return to the White House as the self-appointed “crypto president”, Ryan could identify “a massive American-shaped opportunity”.SEC drops lawsuit against Winklevoss twins’ crypto firmRead moreTrump’s re-election washeavily bankrolledby crypto companies and advocacy groups; the sector had establishedlucrative tiesto the Trump family, and expected a slate ofpolicy changesin its favor. A second Trump administration was likely to bolster the crypto industry’s ability to expand into the traditional financial sector, and vice versa, further buoying up Ethereum’s prospects. These new political and economic realities meant a “stronger voice” from the EF that could mean a windfall for Ethereum – a logic that helped catalyze a high-profile leadership shakeup within the Ethereum ecosystem, and, once the dust settled, anointed new leaders tasked with wooing Wall Street.Despite strong winds at the industry’s back, the value of Ethereum’s proprietary cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), is down 20% from one year ago, part of awidespread slump in crypto’s value. The price has remained almost unchanged since November 2024, when Ryan made his pitch, which is the same as it was in 2022, an asset at risk of depreciating in a world of high risk.ETH’s dual, dueling factionsThe Ethereum blockchain is a hub for hundreds of billions of dollars of financial products. Ether is the world’s second largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization hovering around $400bn. Founded in 2013 by programmer Buterin, ether is also the largest cryptocurrency to have a known leader. The identity of the founder ofBitcoin, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, is not publicly known. Following Ethereum’s launch, Buterin and others established the EF as a non-profit tasked with cultivating the Ethereum ecosystem – a centralized, neutral entity designed to grow a decentralized technological movement – and writing grants to ecosystem participants in line with that mission; the EF holds more than $600m worth of ETH in treasury. Buterin sits on the EF’s board.“In crypto in general, there are two sides of the space: there’s what they call the computer, and what they call the casino,” said Timour Kosters, the founder ofEdge City, a series of pop-up residency programs affiliated with Ethereum. The “computer” side looks to tackle systemic issues by building tech solutions, Kosters explained; the “casino” side leans into finance, including some scams. The two most prominent ideological camps within Ethereum follow this rule of thumb. On one end is Ethereum’s traditional and more libertarian ideological base, the “Cypherpunks”, who see privacy, decentralized protocols and freedom from state power as tools for individual freedom. On the other end, according to Paul Dylan-Ennis, a scholar who studies Ethereum’s subcultures, is a more “pragmatist” and “populist” cadre motivated by the price of ETH and seeking to expand institutional adoption of Ethereum and ETH.Ryan recalled the discussions with Buterin of his proposed strategic plan for the EF as being “positive”, and said the dialogue expanded to include other leaders within the foundation. That included Aya Miyaguchi, the organization’s longtime executive director and astewardof Ethereum’s traditional ideological core. But then news of these discussions was leaked to the public – opening the floodgates on social media.On X, some Ethereum users clamored for Ryan’s appointment, and lobbied for Miyaguchi’s ouster. Eric Conner, a veteran Ethereum developer,suggested“it’s revolt time” if the foundation failed to appoint Ryan as its new executive director. Some social media usersposteddeath threats against Miyaguchi, which incensed Buterin.ETH holders pressure their leadersSome Ethereum community members had been calling for leadership change at the EF over the course of 2024 – long before Ryan’s strategic meetings with EF leadership. Many pragmatists thought the foundation was not proactive enough in growing Ethereum’s adoption, including among financial institutions. Others blamed Miyaguchi for Ether’s relatively static price, as ETH had not skyrocketed in value the way bitcoin and other coins had with Trump’s rise.Paul Brody, who leads blockchain initiatives at Ernst & Young and is the chairman of theEnterprise Ethereum Alliance, a coalition of large businesses adopting Ethereum-based technology, said that, while critiques against Miyaguchi were “tinged with misogyny”, calling for a leadership change because of Ethereum’s static price resembles standard investor discontents.“In some ways, the Ethereum community is behaving a lot like pretty normal shareholders … They want a return on their investment,” he said.In January 2025, Buterin responded to this community pressure, framing the threats levied against Miyaguchi as “pure evil”. He added that the complaints were “decreasing the chance I have any interest whatsoever in doing ‘what you want’”.“The person deciding the new EF leadership team is me,” hetweeted.A former member of the EF, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal foundation matters, said Buterin’s social media post was a “turning point” and “uncharacteristic”, as the founder typically “pretended that [Ethereum] was in the hands of the community”. The former EF employee told the Guardian that EF management organized a foundation-wide retreat “in order to force” Buterin into naming a new executive director quickly, as Buterin “couldn’t really make up his mind”, and Miyaguchi had wanted to step back “for a while”. The source added that, in personal conversation, Buterin dismissed Ryan’s backers as a small but vocal American subset of the global Ethereum ecosystem. By the end, “the old management” was “almost universally hated” by the EF’s employees, they said.Another former EF employee, likewise speaking on the condition of anonymity, similarly noted that Buterin’s tweets were a departure from his typical “cosplaying” that he didn’t control Ethereum. Buterin and Miyaguchi have a close relationship, the former employee alleged, which informed Buterin’s reluctance to find Miyaguchi’s replacement more expediently, the source hypothesized.They claimed Buterin “isn’t over” the rejection of his work visa by US authorities in 2012 and remains “resolutely” against EF staff talking to US politicians. The former employee suspected this disfavor counted against Ryan, an American. Buterin only finalized a leadership change once he realized the extent of dissatisfaction within the EF, not just online, the employee concluded.Change is in the air, finallyOn 1 March 1, the EFannouncedthe appointment of two co-executive directors: one from each strand of Ethereum’s culture, according to Dylan-Ennis, the Ethereum scholar: Tomasz Stańczak, a former vice-president at Citi, and Hsiao-Wei Wang, a veteran Ethereum-focused engineer.The EF’s new leaders were brought on specifically with a “mandate of being more open, communicating more, and [being] responsible to the business world”, which is home to “builders focused on real-world use cases”, Stańczak told the Guardian in November. “Compared to previous years, there is probably much more green light for institutions to adopt Ethereum,” he added. The EF now operatesa landing pagedesigned for institutions interested in understanding and potentially adopting Ethereum technology.Two former EF employees said these basic changes highlight the extent to which the foundation had previously adopted a “defensive posture” and had “worried about the SEC”, using opacity and plausible deniability to avoid legal action. To that end, the EF only published a public-facing organizational chart over the summer, partly anonymizing its employees prior to that shift. The foundation’s growth and clear hierarchy also depart from its longstanding decentralized ethos; during her time as executive director, Miyaguchi hadcalled forthe EF to “subtract” in size and power over time.“The surprising twist in recent times is now the EF is seen as very much directing ‘Ethereum the protocol’ and, to some extent, ‘Ethereum the culture’,” Dylan-Ennis said. “In this sense, [the foundation] has become more important than ever. It is too early to say whether this is for the better or the worse.”‘American-shaped opportunity’Ryan emphasized in an interview that he has “the utmost respect for Aya Miyaguchi”. The public leak of their discussions around the EF’s future led to “a lot of toxicity” that “threw off” their dialogue, he added. Buterin and Ryan decided to amicably “close the door” on their discussions by January 2025. Ryan said this was not solely because of the online campaign, but also due to differences in opinion about the Ethereum Foundation’s next steps – including the “American-shaped opportunity” lying beyond the EF’s interests.Connected to other Wall Street-facing Ethereum evangelists by senior EF leadership, Ryan announced in February 2025 that he was co-foundingEtherealize, an EF-aligned organization building and marketing Ethereum-based products for traditional financial institutions. Etherealize frequently exercises a strong voice for Ethereum as it does the rounds on Capitol Hill and Wall Street.Vivek Raman, a co-founder ofEtherealize, said Ethereum-focused sales cycles with large financial institutions once spanned years and involved frequent rejection, but are now accelerating, a sign Wall Street is warming to cryptocurrency. Major firms like JP Morgan, Fidelity and BlackRock are seeking to offer financial products issued on blockchains, in a process called “tokenization”, he said, predicting that a wave of these products will enter the market in 2026 after December 2025 launches.However, ether, like other major cryptocurrencies, is still crawling back from a sudden drop in value.“The price of crypto has fallen like 40% in the last six months,” said Brody of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. “You don’t see people talking about the current leadership … the way they did about Aya 18 months ago. You just don’t.”Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesBitcoinE-commercefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The current situation is unsustainable.”Karl Turner, the Hull East MP and a vocal critic of the current No 10 operation, said McSweeney staying wouldleave the prime minister’s position “untenable”. “I don’t want the PM to go. What I want is the PM to make changes,” he told the BBC.Downing Street officials pointed to Starmer’s strong defence of McSweeney in the Commons on Wednesday, in which he said nothing had changed. Supporters of the PM are aware that shedding his chief of staff could leave Starmer more directly in the firing line in a future crisis.Amid continued speculation about a possible leadership challenge, Starmer sought to regain the initiative with a speech and media Q&A in Hastings, ostensibly about community values but which was dominated by the Mandelson aftermath.Starmer said he understood the frustration of his MPs, and called on them to rally round the government.Saying the victims of Epstein had “lived with trauma that most of us could barely comprehend”, Starmer went on: “I want to say this. I am sorry – sorry for what was done to you, sorry that so many people with power failed, sorry for having believed Mandelson’s lies and appointed him, and sorry that even now you’re forced to watch this story unfold in public once again.”Pressed on why he had approved the appointment whenMandelson’s post-prison links to Epstein were public knowledge, he dodged the question, blaming what he said were lies by Mandelson and the need to examine vetting procedures.View image in fullscreenThe prime minister has said Morgan McSweeney retains his confidence.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThere is increasing frustration among some ministers about the delay in releasing the documents. None are expected until next week at the earliest, and with officials saying they do not even knowhow many messages and files might be involved, there are concerns the process could take weeks.Starmer had planned to release documents on Wednesday, before the Conservative motion that forced the issue, but he was delayed by a warning from the Metropolitan police that some of the information could affect their investigation into whether Mandelson leaked market-sensitive information as a minister.The Mandelson Scandal: has Starmer finally lost control? – Politics WeeklyRead moreSome in the cabinet believe the government should overrule the police, with one arguing it would show “leadership” to exercise judgment that documents relating to Mandelson’s vetting were not likely to have any links to the criminal investigation.However, of the material the Met has so far been shown by the government, it is understood to have concerns over only a small number of documents being published, believed to be fewer than 10, a small portion of those reviewed by detectives.For the majority of documents, detectives raised no objections to them being released to the public.Wednesday’s Commons motion said any decisions on whether documents should be held back or redacted would be made not by the government but by parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC), a compromise that got Labour backbenchers on board.In a letter to Starmer on Thursday, the chair and deputy chair of the ISC said any material deemed sensitive should be provided in full to them, with the committee deciding what should not be published.The ISC could not say how long its task would take until it knew the number of documents to be examined, said the letter from Labour peer Kevan Jones, the chair, and Conservative MP Jeremy Wright, the vice-chair. The committee, they added, would be “grateful to, now, be told the date on which we will receive those papers”.While Downing Street said it had “begun discussions with the ISC about the process for releasing these documents”, the committee disputes this, saying it was carrying out the wishes of the Commons, not No 10, and that ministers simply had to provide the information.What are files from Mandelson’s US ambassador appointment likely to reveal?Read moreThe vacuum of new information is making itharder for Downing Street to move on from speculationabout Starmer’s future. UK long-term borrowing costs hit their highest level since the budget on Thursday as traders reacted to the possibility of a change in No 10.Asked about mass dissatisfaction among his MPs, Starmer told them to instead focus on key messages like the cost of living, saying: “Every minute you spend not talking and focusing on that is an absolute minute wasted.”But even many sympathetic voices seem to be losing patience. Speaking to Sky’s Electoral Dysfunction podcast, Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, said Starmer should “stop blaming Mandelson”, take responsibility for the appointment and undertake a “reset” of his No 10 team.She added: “I don’t think it’s inevitable that it will bring him down, but it will bring him down unless he takes the action, which is really necessary for him to take.”Opposition parties have called for a no-confidence vote in the prime minister, with the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, raising the issue on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourPeter MandelsonMorgan McSweeneynewsShareReuse this content"

Disoriented and cold, they were dressed in prison-issued tracksuits and carried their few belongings in plastic bags.Hours earlier, they had been sitting with their wrists and ankles shackled on the plush leather seats of a private jet owned by the Florida property tycoon Gil Dezer, a longtime business partner ofDonald Trump.Dezer is also a Trump donor, friend ofDonald Trump Jrand member of the Miami branch of Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.Gil Dezer and Donald Trump at an event in 2011.Photograph: Miami Herald/Tribune News Service/Getty ImagesHis sleek Gulfstream jet – which he has called “my little rocket ship” – was used to transport the men from an airport near a notorious removal centre in Arizona to Tel Aviv. The jet made three refuelling stops en route: in New Jersey, Ireland and Bulgaria.A Guardian investigation has established the flight was part of a secretive and politically sensitive US government operation to deport Palestinians arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to the Israeli-occupied West Bank.One of those deported on the January flight was Maher Awad, a 24-year-old originally from the West Bank, who had lived in the US for nearly a decade. Speaking to the Guardian in the town of Rammun, Maher shared photos of his girlfriend and newborn son in Michigan.Awad is one of several men onboard two recent flights who have been identified by the Guardian and the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine. “I grew up in America,” he said. “America was heaven for me.”On Monday this week, Dezer’s 16-passenger luxury jet was used a second time to transport another group of Palestinian deportees. They landed at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport and also appear to have been taken to the West Bank.Former US officials and immigration lawyers said the flights – and Israel’s assistance in returning Palestinians to the occupied territory – marked a shift in policy driven by the Trump administration’s aggressive mass deportation campaign.View image in fullscreenIsraeli security personnel receive a handcuffed Palestinian deported from the US at Israel’s Ben Gurion international airport.Photograph: Unknown/HaaretzA photographpublishedby the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which first reported the January flight, shows the men were met at Ben Gurion airport by a huddle of Israeli security personnel. From there, according to Awad, armed guards took them to a checkpoint near the West Bank village of Ni’lin.“They dropped us off like animals on the side of the road,” Awad said. “We went to a local house, we knocked on the door, we were like: ‘Please help us out.’”Mohammad Kanaan, a university professor whose house is near to the checkpoint, recalled the moment Awad appeared in the village. Kanaan, who was wearing a red keffiyeh scarf to protect from the cold wind, took a selfie with the men.View image in fullscreenMohammad Kanaan with deported Palestinian men left at the West Bank village of Ni’lin.

The Israeli army usually doesn’t release prisoners at this checkpoint,” he said. “They stayed at my place for only two hours. During that time, we fed them. They called their families who either came to pick them up or arranged transportation for them.”He added: “They did not have any contact with their families for a long time. Their families considered them missing.”‘I was at his wedding.

I was at his wedding. He was at my wedding. We’re good friends. Very proud that he’s in the office. Very proud of the job he’s doing.”Dezer’s aircraft, which he hasdescribedas “my favourite toy”, was chartered by ICE through Journey Aviation, a Florida-based company (which declined to comment on the flights to Israel). Public records show Journey is frequently contracted by US agencies to charter private jets.According to Human Rights First (HRF), which tracks deportation flights, Dezer’s jet made four “removal flights” – to Kenya, Liberia, Guinea and Eswatini – starting last October, before its two recent trips to Israel.In an email, Dezer told the Guardian he was “never privy to the names” of those who travelled onboard his jet when it was privately chartered by Journey, or the purpose of the flight. “The only thing I’m notified about is the dates of use,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe website of Journey Aviation, which is used to advertise Gil Dezer’s luxury Gulfstream jet for private charter.Photograph: Journey AviationHe did not respond to further questions about the use of his jet by the Trump administration to deport Palestiniansthrough Israel.US officials did not answer questions about the cost of the two recent flights to Israel but,according to ICE, chartered flight costs have ranged between nearly $7,000 and more than $26,000 per flight hour in the past. Aviation industry sources estimated the flights to and from Israel would have cost ICE between $400,000 and $500,000.Savi Arvey, HRF’s director of research and analysis for refugee and immigrant rights, said Dezer’s jet was “part of an opaque system of private aircraft facilitating” a mass deportation campaign that “has blatantly disregarded due process, separated families, and is operated without any accountability”.Flown across the world in shacklesAircraft tracking data shows that both the 21 January and 1 February flights to Israel made refuelling stops at Shannon airport in Ireland and at Sofia airport in Bulgaria. Those stops may raise questions for the authorities in those countries about the legal status of the passengers transited through their territory.The eight Palestinians had their ankles shackled on the 21 January flight, according to Awad and another man onboard, Sameer Isam Aziz Zeidan, a 47-year-old grocery worker. Awad said he was forced to wear a body restraint, with his wrists handcuffed to his stomach. Both men said the restraints made it difficult to eat, requiring them to bend their heads forward to put food in their mouths.In an interview, Zeidan’s uncle said he had left the West Bank for the US in the early 2000s and, until he was deported, lived in Louisiana with his wife and five children. He said Zeidan, who served time in prison about a decade ago and failed to renew his green card, was detained by ICE more than a year ago. “Now he cannot go back to the [United] States. His whole family is there,” he said.View image in fullscreenMaher Awad with his partner, Sandra McMyler, in Michigan before he was deported.Photograph: HandoutLike Zeidan, Awad has family in the US, including a four-month-old son whom he’s never met as he was born while Awad was in ICE detention.Awad said he was 15 when he left the West Bank and travelled alone to the US on a tourist visa, joining siblings and extended family. He went to high school in Michigan and later worked at the family’s various businesses – including a popular shawarma shop in Kalamazoo – as well as selling cars.He said he obtained a US social security number, paid taxes, and got a driving licence. He met and moved in with an American woman he planned to marry. “Everything I know, everything I experienced was in the United States,” he said.They had only recently learned they were expecting a child when Awad called the police in February 2025 to report a break-in at their home. When the officers showed up, they apparently arrested Awad in relation to a domestic violence charge from the previous year.View image in fullscreenMaher Awad in the West Bank, on a video call with Sandra McMyler and their baby son, Taj.Photograph: Sufian TahaAwad was detained for two days.

He said when Israeli soldiers stopped him at a checkpoint recently, all he had to show was his Michigan driver’s licence.His life, he said, was in the US. “I don’t want to be here. I’m looking forward to going back as soon as possible.”In Michigan, McMyler told the Guardian she was struggling without Awad and missed his cooking and the way he made every day feel like it was her birthday. “He wants to be able to help me take care of his baby. He wants to hold him, kiss him, talk to him, everything,” she said. “I want my family back together.”A spokesperson for the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not answer questions about the deportation flights to Israel, but said: “If a judge finds an illegal alien has no right to be in this country, we are going to remove them. Period.”The US Department of State declined to comment beyond saying it “coordinates closely with DHS on efforts to repatriate illegal aliens”.

The memo, titled “Investigation into Potential Co-Conspirators of Jeffrey Epstein” and dated 19 December 2019, summarised interviews with victims, witnesses and subjects of its investigation.There is no evidence that prosecutors decided to pursue the allegations. Staley, who has previously denied any wrongdoing, did not respond to requests for comment made over several months, either directly or via his lawyers. He has never been charged with a crime related to the allegations.During a UK court hearing in 2025, Staley admitted to havingsex with a member of Epstein’s staffin New York, but agreed with a lawyer during cross-examination that he would describe the intercourse as “consensual”.The memo refers to one woman’s recollection of events that allegedly occurred “in or around 2011 or 2012”. It says: “Epstein instructed [redacted] to provide a massage toJes Staleyin Epstein’s New York residence. [Redacted] attempted to give him an ordinary massage, but he forced [redacted] to touch his genitals and then raped [redacted].“Afterwards, [redacted] complained to Epstein, who said he left it to [redacted] and Staley to decide whether to engage in sex. After this incident, [redacted] began to distance herself from Epstein.”This allegation was included in a section labelled: “Interviews of Victims Who Were Abused As Adults”.A separate section of the memo again cites allegations against Staley and another financier, Leon Black. “[Redacted] recalled Epstein asking her to massage Leon Black and Jes Staley, both of whom engaged in sexual contact with her against her will during the massages. Moreover, according to [redacted], when she complained to Epstein about the sexual contact, he laughed and told [redacted] that it was up to her whether to engage in sex during those massages.”The final 15 pages of the document, which summarises potential charges and evidence against some of Epstein’s associates and employees, is heavily redacted. It is not clear whether Staley or Black were interviewed or made aware of the investigation.A lawyer representing Leon Black said: “Mr Black asked for an independent investigation of his relationship with Epstein. The Dechert law firm investigated and reviewed more than 60,000 documents, interviewed more than 20 people and concluded that Mr Black paid Epstein for estate planning and tax advice and that he had no awareness of Epstein’s criminal activities. Of the three civil lawsuits filed against Mr Black, one has been dismissed, the other withdrawn and the other is currently facing a case terminating motion for sanctions. There is absolutely no truth to any of the allegations against Mr Black.”Epstein, once a well-connected financier, used “massages” as a method to groom and sexually abuse teenage girls. He initially pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in the early 2000s, and was subsequently handed an 18-month jail sentence in 2008. He died in prison in August 2019 died in while awaiting trial over child sex trafficking charges.Allegations against Staley were also discussed in aninternal email between two staff membersfrom the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York on 14 December 2019, the files reveal. That was sent five days before the 86-page internal memo appears to have been produced. “Don’t know if you caught this but one of the non/minor Epstein victims alleges that Jes Staley (reads in memo as “Jess Daily”) raped her during a massage. P. 31,” the email reads.A separatedocument in the filesmarked “CONFIDENTIAL FOR ATTORNEY’S EYES ONLY”, but undated, suggests a victim was left with body marks after an interaction with the former Barclays boss. “The disgusting Mr. staley if anyone ever calls me tinkerbell again I will lose my mind. He left bloody marks on my arms from his belt and thought he had had the right to call me that when he has ears as big as a dumbo. I should have called him that in return!”Staley was involved in anexchangewith Epstein referring to Disney princesses from 9 to 10 July 2010, details of which have been circulating in the media since 2021. In those emails Staley tells Epstein: “That was fun. Say hi to Snow White.”“What character would you like next?” Epstein laters asks, to which Staley replied: “Beauty and the Beast.” Epstein responded: “Well one side is availble [sic].”A UK court last year heard that Staley had denied knowledge of this exchange, saying “I, honest to God, when I went through the emails I have no idea what this refers to. I have no idea who Snow White is.”Newly unsealed documents show that there wasanother email sent to Epsteinby an unnamed individual, also on 10 July 2010, saying “the snow white was f..ed twice as soon as she put her costume))”.The Epstein files also show Epstein asked an unnamed individual to buy a Snow White costume weeks before that exchange with Staley, on 20 June 2010. “brett ratner ,is going to film a big movie„ Snow White, i would love to take photos of you in a snow white costume. you can get it from the costume store”.“Will get it!”, the recipient replies.Staley’s reputation has been tarnished as a result of his well-documented friendship with the child sex offender.Staley originally met Epstein in 2000 after he became head of JP Morgan’s private bank, where Epstein was a client. Staley later took over as chief executive of one of the UK’s largest banks, Barclays, in 2015 but was forced to step down in 2021 after City regulators launched an investigation into his relationship with Epstein.Staley was eventually banned from taking any job in the UK’s financial sector for playing down those ties. He tried and failed to overturn that banking ban last year in a court battle that revealed intimate details of the pair’s friendship.The Epstein files have thrown up more recent exchanges from June 2023,including a memoproduced by US attorneys’ offices representing different districts of New York, following a call with a lawyer representing Epstein victims.The emailed memo suggests that DANY – probably New York County District Attorney’s Office – “do not doubt her allegations against JE and LB,” believed to refer to Jeffrey Epstein and Leon Black. “They believe she was also abused by Staley. They have not found any independent corroboration,” it says. The lawyer is said to be representing an unnamed victim “in connection with civil claims related to JE and any other individuals related, Black/Staley. And also in connection with criminal matters”.The US Department of Justice, which coordinates responses on behalf of the US attorneys’ offices, did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinJes StaleyBankingBarclaysFinancial sectorJP MorganSexual harassmentnewsShareReuse this content"

These are projected to reach £14bn in two years’ time.The government is expected to publish a long-awaited education white paper in the coming weeks setting out its proposals to overhaul the Send system, which is regarded as broken by parents and schools and financially unsustainable by councils.The Send reforms are regarded as politically fraught, with ministers anxious to slow the growth in spending while avoiding a backbench rebellion and a damagingclash with parents and charitiesoverconcernsthat existingchildren’s rightswill be diluted.The Local Government Association (LGA) said 95% of top-tier councils were operating Send deficits, with four-fifths saying they were having to cut council services or take out loans to meet the day to day cost of financing Send overspends.One council has asked ministers for special permission to raise council tax by above permitted limits to cover the £10m-a-year costs of financing loans needed to cover its Send deficit.Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council has proposed raising council tax by 7.5% from April, breaking the 4.99% limit. Its accumulated Send deficit stands at £184m and it anticipates will rise to £380m by the end of March 2028.The council said it had been technically insolvent since April 2025 when its Send deficit became larger than its available financial reserves. It will borrow £95m over the next 12 months to bridge a shortfall between what it receives from the government for Send services and the amount it is legally required to spend on them.At the end of March 2028, an accounting “override” that allows councils to keep Send spending deficits off balance sheet will come to an end. The LGA survey suggests that if the deficit is not cleared at that point, 79% of councils will in effect become insolvent overnight.Even if the accumulated debts were cleared in 2028, the LGA says failure to reform the system would result in ongoing spending exceeding budgets in 95% of council areas. The Office for Budget Responsibility hasestimated this funding gapat £6bn in 2028-29.Guardian analysis of recent council papers reveals the huge scale of some Send deficits. Hampshire county council, for example, projects an accumulated deficit of £706m by the end of March 2028. West Sussex county council expects a corresponding deficit of £414m, and Suffolk county council £250m.The LGA said that despite record levels of investment and a high rate of assessment and identification of needs, “there was no clear evidence that outcomes for children with Send have been improving”.It is unclear whether government would wipe historical Send debts without guarantees from councils that they will cut ongoing costs partly by shifting a greater proportion of Send provision into local mainstream schools and reducing reliance on more expensive private specialist schools.There are concerns that a no-strings-attached debt write-off would raise fairness issues. AGuardian investigation last yearfound that of the 32 councils with accumulated Send deficits of more than £50m, 24 were in the wealthiest areas of England.Much of the increase in spending relates to the rapid growth over the past decade in children and young people having education, health and care plans, which in theory guarantee support for pupils. Numbers have risen from 240,000 in 2014 to about 640,000.Amanda Hopgood, the chair of the LGA’s children, young people and families committee, said: “Councils are committed to supporting every child and young person to achieve their potential and clearly what is important is that children and young people get the support they need. But under the current system, the rise in support need has left many councils buckling under the strain.”The government was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsLocal governmentEnglandChildrenSchool fundingEducation policyShareReuse this content"

They are then allowed to wait for their turn away from often crowded queues.But the company said disabled visitors with “additional accessibility needs” have said the digital pass “simply isn’t working for them, particularly as demand has grown and queue times for these guests have increased”.People who have “difficulty with crowds” have so far been provided with access to the pass.But under a trial that will run during the half-term holidays from 14 to 22 February, Merlin will reserve the pass for guests who have “difficulty standing”, “level access” or “urgent toilet needs”.People who have difficulty with crowds will instead be given one free “essential companion” ticket and will have access to sensory rooms and quiet spaces at the park.The changes will also be enforced at Chessington World of Adventures and Windsor Legoland, which are also run by Merlin.Christine Flintoft-Smith, head of autism accreditation and projects at the National Autistic Society (NAS), acknowledged “the concerns of autistic people and their families about the changes”, adding that the group “met with Merlin to raise concerns directly and to hear their plans for the future”.Flintoft-Smith emphasised that NAS has worked with “Merlin for many years, so we know how committed the team is to ensuring that their facilities are friendly and welcoming for autistic visitors”.She continued: “We are pleased that Merlin is listening to feedback from autistic visitors to their sites on the changes, and have said they will review the new arrangement after the February half-term.”Rob Smith, chief operating officer at Merlin, also recognised changes “raised concerns for some guests”.“Our commitment to supporting neurodiverse guests and those with mental health needs remains,” he said.“We are listening carefully to this feedback and are committed to keeping this approach under review ahead of our main season openings in March.“We remain deeply committed to creating inclusive experiences and ensuring all guests feel supported when visiting our attractions.”Visitors to Alton Towers can opt to buy a “Fastrack” pass to skip the queues, but these start at an extra £35 on top of the ticket price.The approach will be reviewed after the half-term holidays.Explore more on these topicsNeurodiversityAutismAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderTheme parksDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

It is going to take a seriously good team to beat France in Paris in this year’s championship and ­watching them attack will be an ­absolute treat. Ireland were not so much beaten as outplayed by ­opponents who will be even more dangerous with a dry ball at their disposal.Never mind the argument about brief in-game adverts during ITV’s coverage. Irish fans would probably have preferred a total 80-minute blackout or, failing that, an entire evening of cookery programming. Instead those back at home had to watch the visitors being repeatedly sliced and diced by seemingly ravenous hosts. Talk about eating your greens.France v Ireland: Six Nations 2026 opener – liveRead moreHad it been a drier evening it really could have been messy. As it was the ­spectacularly good Louis Bielle-­Biarrey still helped himself to two sparkling tries and France’s close-quarters passing, kicking game and creative elan were sometimes ­sublime. Ireland arrived with a raft of injuries but, despite a second-half rally, they can now add bruised pride to the list. Their head coach, Andy Farrell, was certainly not looking for excuses afterwards.“You make your own luck in this game and you make your own luck by being ahead of the game in most things that are probably without the ball,” he said. “We certainly lost that battle in the first half. Things like the high balls and winning the scraps on the floor, and running through tackles and ourselves missing tackles, that’s the main part of the game, isn’t it?“We certainly came off second best in that regard in the first half. Our response to that in the second half – and a gallant response – [was good] but it’s not what we want to be, a responding team. We need to show up from the get-go.”France’s performance will also be food for thought for the rest of the field.While the Six Nations holders were without one or two key forwards themselves, you would never have guessed it.Les Bleusare not yet the finished ­article and eased off slightly with the match already won but their promise is unmistakable. Ireland, for their part, were made to look poor for the opening 40 minutes and will be grateful to their bench for bringing a little more second-half energy in this experimental slot for a Six Nations opening fixture.And maybe there is a longer-term future for big-time Thursday night rugby. The light show inside the Stade de France made it feel like a Friday night in everything but name and the Marseillaise was sung with just as much gusto. When they want to put on a show in Paris there are few places quite as dazzling.It was also great to see Antoine Dupont back on Six Nations duty for the first time since wrecking his cruciate ligamentagainst Ireland in Dublinlast year. Like everyone else, though, he was required to deal with ­conditions that were testing in the extreme. A sodden pitch and slippery ball can make life awkward even for the very best playmakers.View image in fullscreenMatthieu Jalibert scores France’s second try despite the efforts of Ireland’s Cian Prendergast.Photograph: INPHO/ShutterstockFrance, though, came close to ­conjuring something miraculous in the opening minutes. A rapid attack down the left was somehow kept alive by Bielle-Biarrey who showed ­exceptional footballing ­ability to ­dribble his side within range of the Irish line. The ball eventually rebounded forward off Charles Ollivon but it was an early sign of the threat this young French side can offer.Ireland had been suitably warned. With only 12 minutes on the clock the hosts had their first try and what a cracker it was. For a moment ­Ireland seemed to have cleared the danger when Sam Prendergast hacked a ball up the touchline like a lower league right-back clearing his lines. France, though, managed to keep it alive and found the lurking Bielle-­Biarrey, who slid out of a tap tackle by ­Prendergast and rounded the last man to add ­further gloss to his already ­shimmering reputation.Ireland’s only option was to dig deep and battle like mad for everything. Even that strategy was barely enough as France poured forward again, denied a second try only when Nicolas Depoortère’s final pass with the line begging ended up in Prendergast’s hands rather than either of the two blue-shirted players outside him.Again it was only a temporary reprieve as France neatly exploited the territorial platform to work the alert Matthieu Jalibert over. The mass rush to congratulate the Bordeaux fly-half said a lot about how the rest of his team see their No 10, regardless of his previously tepid relationship with the head coach, Fabien Galthié.There was also no hiding the ­ability and impact of the young French lock Mickaël Guillard, another with a big international future ahead of him. Time and again he came looking for work, forcing Ireland to soak up a worrying number of early tackles. The 25-year-old Lyon forward can play, too, surging into the line to maintain yet another French counterattack before throwing a deft inside scoring pass to the busy Ollivon,View image in fullscreenNick Timoney scores Ireland’s first try to belatedly put the visitors on the scoresheet.Photograph: Brendan Moran/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesWith Thomas Ramos kicking well it made it 22-0 at the interval with ­Ireland barely in the frame. Apart from one brief moment when ­Prendergast and Ramos were in a shoulder-to-shoulder sprint for a loose ball close to the French line there was barely a moment to make an Irish heart flutter with optimism. Even then it would not have counted, with the referee, Karl Dickson, ruling Prendergast had unfairly impeded his opponent.France did not even concede a single first-half penalty and their fourth try was another collector’s item, Ramos side-footing the ball to Bielle-Biarrey after Dupont’s little chip over the top. Ireland did finally save some face just before the hour mark when Nick Timoney crashed over and, shortly afterwards, his fellow replacement Michael Milne grabbed a second. It massaged the scoreboard pain slightly but did little to alter the wider narrative, a truth further underlined by Théo Attissogbe’s late score in the right corner.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026France rugby union teamIreland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Deportations of foreign national offenders have risen by 32%, with more than 8,700 deported under thisLabourgovernment.TheHome Officealso released footage showing a recent removals flight, with detainees, their faces blurred, being escorted on to a plane destined for eastern Europe.The figures have been released as the home secretary,Shabana Mahmood, said she would “scale up” the number of deportations even further.Keir Starmer’s government, languishing third in recent polls behind Reform UK and the Tories, has pledged to ramp up deportations, end the use of asylum hotels and curb the number of small boats bringing people across the Channel.More than 65,000 people have arrived in the UK by crossing the Channel since Starmer became prime minister.The Home Office is preparing to introduce legislation to stop those facing possible removal from “gaming the system” by using the European convention on human rights to appeal against their removal.The UK is one of several countries pushing for changes in the way the treaty is interpreted, notably in its Article 3 protection against inhuman or degrading treatment and the Article 8 right to a family life.Both articles have been used to challenge deportation and removal decisions. Unauthorised migrants will also be restricted to a single route of appeal, the Home Office outlined.Mahmood said: “I vowed to scale up removals of illegal migrants – and we have. However, we must go further to remove those that have no right to be in our country. I will do whatever it takes to restore order and control.”The government has also pledged to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by the end of this parliament by using more basic accommodation such as military sites instead.Fewer than 200 asylum accommodation hotels remain in use, the government said, compared with a peak of 400 under the previous government.Reacting to the Home Office announcement, Minnie Rahman, the chief executive of the migrant charity Praxis, said: “Many of those labelled ‘foreign national offenders’ have lived in the UK for most of their lives and have a legitimate right to be here.“Yet, while the government has still not implemented key lessons from theWindrushlessons learned review, it continues to promote harmful and racist stereotypes that equate migration with criminality. This is unjust, divisive, and deeply damaging.”Griff Ferris, a spokesperson for the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: “The government continues to perpetrate this cruelty and violence in an increasingly desperate attempt to court the far right. It has gone very far down a very dark road, and this announcement of mass deportations while also seeking to gut rights protections is frightening, alongside the home secretary using openly fascist rhetoric.“Behind these numbers are real people who have had their lives torn apart. We need a compassionate system that puts people first, with the same routes of travel accessible for everyone, and the same good quality, safe housing for everyone.”Natasha Tsangarides, a director at Freedom from Torture, said: “Chipping away at Article 3 of the ECHR is a dangerous game that could trigger a domino effect worldwide. Any attempts to erode Article 3 protections risks undermining our shared right to live a life free from torture and does the dirty work of repressive regimes abroad. This is not who we are as a country.”Explore more on these topicsHome OfficeImmigration and asylumShabana MahmoodLabourMigrationPublic services policyHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

And the risks are very small, according to the systematic review and meta-analysis published inthe Lancet.Statins have been used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide over the last three decades and are proven to reduce heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular deaths. At the same time, millions have been put off the drugs amid long-running safety concerns, with statin labels listing dozens of possible side-effects.The study is the most comprehensive assessment of evidence for listed side-effects of statins. It examined 19 randomised controlled trials involving 124,000 people, with an average follow-up of four and a half years.Of the 66 side-effects currently listed on product labels, researchers found no strong evidence to support statins causing 62 of them, such as memory problems, depression, sleep disturbances and nerve damage leading to tingling in the hands and feet.The results showed the risk of most listed side-effects was minimal while the benefits far outweighed potential harms. As a result, labels should be updated to better reflect the evidence so patients and doctors could make more informed choices about statins, the researchers said.The study’s lead author, Christina Reith, an associate professor at Oxford University, said: “What we were able to show reliably was that statins did not make these commonly experienced events occur more often.“So for example, the percentage of people suffering memory loss per year was similar to those taking statin therapy as those not, equally. The percentage of people suffering sleep problems per year was similar to those taking statin therapy as for those not.“This means that we now have really good evidence that although these things may well happen to people while they take statins, that statins are not the cause of these problems.”While the study also noted the potential for side-effects appearing after statin use for longer than the average follow-up time, Reith said it provided “reassurance that, for most people, the risk of side-effects is greatly outweighed by the benefits of statins”.Prof Sir Rory Collins, emeritus professor of medicine and epidemiology at Oxford and a senior author of the paper, said: “Now that we know that statins do not cause the majority of side-effects listed in package leaflets, statin information requires rapid revision to help patients and doctors make better-informed health decisions.”Prof Bryan Williams, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, which part-funded the research, said: “Statins are life-saving drugs, which have been proven to protect against heart attacks and strokes. This evidence is a much-needed counter to the misinformation around statins and should help prevent unnecessary deaths from cardiovascular disease.”Prof Victoria Tzortziou Brown, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “Those considering taking statins should be reassured by this comprehensive study, which shows that while statins, like any medication, have potential side-effects, the risk for most people is low.“It remains important to note that while statins can have real benefits for some patients, they won’t be appropriate for everyone so the decision to prescribe should always be the result of a conversation between the GP and patient about the various risks and benefits.”Explore more on these topicsStatinsHealthMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

No matter his best efforts to convince his supporter base that there was nothing to see here, the demands for the administration to release every document it had on the child sex offenderJeffrey Epsteinonly grew.Yet even afterthe most shocking revelationsin the latest drop about Trump’s inner circle – involving everyone from Elon Musk to the Maga honcho Steve Bannon to the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, not to mention Trump himself – so far, it seems, the administration has escaped largely unscathed. Nobody has resigned, nobody has been fired, and certainly there is no sign that the US president is going anywhere.The Guardian view on Downing Street in crisis: Keir Starmer’s judgment looks fatally flawed | EditorialRead moreThere is, however, one political establishment that the Epstein scandal has shaken to its core – in the UK, where revelations in the files have sent a shock wave through the governing party that threatens to topple it entirely.Although the former Prince Andrew, the brother of King Charles, is the best known Briton toentangle himself in Epstein’s web, there is another figure who has brought the scandal back home with him.Peter Mandelson is another man with “prince” in his title, though his “Prince of Darkness” nickname was coined to reflect his reputation for being a master of the political dark arts. Few people in British politics have had careers as colourful and turbulent as his. Few people have managed to return from the political wilderness in the way he has.View image in fullscreenMandelson shopping with Jeffrey Epstein.Photograph: US Department of JusticeThere may be no coming back from this latest scandal.Police in Londonlaunched a criminal investigationthis week into allegations that Mandelson – who most recently was the British ambassador to the US, but whose history at the heart of British politics is long and laden with scandal – shared sensitive information with Epstein while serving as the government minister for business in 2009.Mandelson, 72, is accused of leaking government emails and market-sensitive information in the aftermath of the financial crash – including alerting Epstein that the British government would soon act to prop up the flagging euro. Separately, Mandelson and his now-husband apparently received several payments totalling at least $75,000. The whiff of selling government secrets is acrid.He has now quit the ruling Labour party, but the bleeding may not stop there:Keir Starmer, the prime minister, faces serious questions about why someone as clearly risky as Mandelson was ever allowed back into the fold.To many in the UK, Mandelson is the long-running embodiment of the New Labour movement, having held high-profile roles in the Labour party over four decades, from strategist to government minister. Perhaps most crucially, he is perceived as a key figure during the remarkable run of electoral success under Tony Blair’s centrist turn in the 1990s that helped bring Labour back in from the cold of the Conservative party’s 18-year grip on power.In an attempt to distance himself – and explain why he hired Mandelson despite having some knowledge of his links to Epstein – Starmer told parliament in London on Wednesday that the politician had “betrayed our country”.View image in fullscreenMandelson (right) was a key figure in Tony Blair’s (left) centrist turn that helped bring Labour back to power in the 1990s.Photograph: Paul McErlane/Reuters“He lied repeatedly to my team, when asked about his relationship with Epstein before and during his tenure as ambassador,” the British leader said. “I regret appointing him. If I knew then what I know now, he would never have been anywhere near government.”Yet Mandelson had already been forced out of government twice before: in 1998, when he resigned as trade and industry secretary after failing to disclose that he secretly received £375,000 to buy a house in London from a colleague who was being investigated over his business dealings; and in 2001, when he stepped down as Northern Ireland secretary after being accused of pulling strings to get a British passport for an Indian billionaire who had pledged £1m towards the Millennium Dome project that Mandelson was heading.What are files from Mandelson’s US ambassador appointment likely to reveal?Read moreStarmer brought him back to advise on how to win the 2024 election anyway, and after Labour’s landslide victory the prime minister chose Mandelson to head the British embassy in Washington. Within a year,Mandelson was firedafter emails were published showing he maintained a friendship with Epstein. The latest cache of Epstein documents released by the US Department of Justice makes the previous allegations seem almost quaint by comparison.Still, with Mandelson being such a long-running presence in the Labour party, the impact of his fall from grace has been widely and deeply felt. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, who has made public his own designs on theleadership, said on Wednesday that he felt personally shaken by the revelations about Mandelson, who had mentored and backed him as a rising parliamentarian.“I cannot state strongly enough how bitterly that betrayal feels for those of us in the Labour party,”he said, “who feel very personally let down and also feel that he, as well as betraying two prime ministers, betraying our country and betraying Epstein’s victims, has fundamentally betrayed our values and the things that motivate us and the things that brought us into politics, which is public service and national interest, not self-service and self-interest.”Even his own MPs have warned that Starmer’s days as prime minister are numbered, particularly after he admitted in parliament that he knew about Mandelson’s friendship with Epstein before his appointment. “The most terminal mood is among the super-loyal,” said one MP, while another said of Starmer’s admission: “You could feel the atmosphere change; it was dark.”1:32‘Sorry for having believed Mandelson’s lies’: Keir Starmer apologises to Epstein victims – videoBut while calling Starmer’s judgment into question, the scandal also appears to have set alight a more fundamental anger at his leadership. His internal critics accuse him of lacking a political and intellectual core, enabling others to manipulate him to their own ends. The tale of how Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s chief adviser, persuaded him to appoint an already compromised character to one of the most sensitive jobs in government, only to see that decision go spectacularly but foreseeably wrong, is held up as another piece of evidence against him.All this discontent plays out as Nigel Farage, the Trump supporter whose hard-right Reform party has led polls for months, looms in the wings.The main message that permeates to voters not following the intrigue in Westminster could be simply that the rot in the British establishment runs deep.Epstein killed himself in a jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on US federal sex-trafficking charges, but his death has done nothing to quell the questions about the high-profile and rich elite he mingled with on both sides of the Atlantic. Richard Branson referred in an email to Epstein’s “harem”. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor had already beenstripped of his titleslast year after the posthumous publication of a book by Virginia Giuffre, an Epstein accuser who died last April, but the latestphotos, showing himsmiling and kneeling on all fours over an unidentified woman on the floor, are a further blow to the British monarchy’s respectability. (Mandelson himself served in a royal position until just recently, on the privy council, a largely ceremonial committee of senior officials that advises the king.)In the US, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general (and Trump’s former personal lawyer), has declared that last Friday’s dump of roughly 3.5m files – out of an estimated 6m total – means prosecutors’ review into the Epstein case “is over”, though survivors beg to disagree. In the UK, the fallout may have just begun.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonJeffrey EpsteinKeir StarmerAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorWes StreetingnewsShareReuse this content"

As the3m emails and 1,800 photos released on Friday by the US Department of Justicestart to percolate across the continent and through to national media, questions about the moral fibre of this elite are starting to be asked at markedly different levels of intensity.Squirming businessmen, bankers, politicians, royals, academics, tech bros and partners in law firms have become entangled in Jeffrey Epstein’s interlocking circles of money, power and sex. It seems there was no one in a position of power that Epstein was not in email contact with, and that there was little limit to what this networking elite was prepared to do in return for a gift, a contact or an invite to a sexually charged party. Elon Musk was right when in July 2025 he tweeted – only to quickly delete it – that “so many powerful people want that list suppressed”.It says something about Britain’s media and political culture that the most heated inquest under way about Epstein is not in the US, but in the UK, and the political leader that may first be required to resign is not Donald Trump, but the owlish and PooterishKeir Starmer.The risk in appointing Peter Mandelson to represent the UK as ambassador in the US, knowing he had been in close contact with Epstein after he had been convicted of sex offences, should have been clear, and sent warning lights flashing on any politician’s dashboard.For Starmer, a leader who has already developed a reputation for weakness in public office, this is a grievous blow. He looks as if he was either rolled over, or lacked the necessary integrity to reject the appointment.The more straightforward charge facing Mandelson is one that may see his career end not just in failure, but in jail. Epstein’s donations to Mandelson, and the business secretary’s supply of commercial sensitive information from the heart of government to Epstein are of interest to the Metropolitan police.For good measure, the judgment of Starmer’s increasingly beleaguered chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, is also in question, something will delight those Labour MPs that have long disliked McSweeney for his pursuit of the Reform vote. Those on Labour’s soft left, and Britain’s hugely competitive press, have a powerful figure essential to Starmer in their sights.By contrast, in the US, Trump, his wife and his Mar-a-Lago club are referred to 38,000 times, but the constitutional lines of accountability to control a president seem to have long gone, while the public seem inured to Trump’s moral flaws. Steve Bannon, a close Epstein friend, also seems immune to criticism. Congress did play a role in eventually forcing Trump to release the documents, but it has shown little interest in pursuing what they show, except if it might ensnare the Clintons.The most high-profile US figure to face reprisals over his friendship with Epstein may be the former treasury secretary Larry Summers. The one-time president of Harvard University stepped back from public commitments last year saying he was “deeply ashamed” after emails with Epstein showed him making sexist remarks and asking for romantic advice.Otherwise, the gossipy fallout between the tech bros, and between Bill and Melinda Gates, has attracted the most interest. Brad Karp, the chair of Paul Weiss, one of the country’s most prominent corporate law firms, quit his post after his email exchanges with Epstein emerged.Also do not expect a hot pursuit in the Saudi press of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Photographs show him smiling and hugging Epstein. Equally, the Emirati press is likely to have little to say about the email exchanges between Epstein and Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, the head of DP World, the giant Dubai ports group.The European country most badly affected is upright Norway, where the royal family, as in the UK, is reeling. Norway’s crown princess, Mette-Marit, has come under scrutiny after documents showed years of contact with Epstein. The unsealed files contain nearly 1,000 mentions of Mette-Marit, including numerous email exchanges between 2011 and 2014. She said in a statement issued by the royal palace: “I showed poor judgment and I deeply regret having had any contact with Epstein. It is simply embarrassing.” Mette-Marit married Crown Prince Haakon in 2001.There is interest, too, in why the children of high-profile Danish diplomat couple Terje Rød-Larsen and Mona Juul were due to receive $10m in a will Epstein signed two days before he died.Børge Brende, another former Norwegian diplomat and now in charge of the World Economic Forum, is also in hot water over 100 text messages and emails including three meetings with Epstein. The extent to which he informed the WEF board of his connections is now under review. Brende said: “I was completely unaware of Epstein’s past and criminal activities.”In Sweden, Joanna Rubinstein, a biologist and president of Sweden for UNHCR (a fundraising foundation for the UN Refugee Agency) has resigned. She visited Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean with her family. “I was aware of the [2008] judgment at the time of my visit. What was subsequently revealed about the extent of the abuse is horrific, and I firmly distance myself from it,” she said.In France, Le Monde has been investigating the links between Epstein and a smattering of French celebrities, including Jack Lang, the 84-year-old former culture minister. In his case there were loans of planes and villas, and links to an offshore company in the Virgin Islands. Lang said: “I meet a lot of people; I’m drawn to the unexpected. Jeffrey was a generous man, a pleasant businessman. He loved art, cinema.”In every country and every language, there is an excuse.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinDonald TrumpKeir StarmerEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Glencore had faced scrutiny over its tax affairs andenvironmental record.Mandelson files will be published even if embarrassing to No 10, says ISC chairRead moreThe pair also discussed the possibility of Mandelson taking a lucrative job as a “fireman”, helping BP to manage the reputational and financial fallout of the 2010Deepwater Horizon oil spill and environmental disaster.Mandelson’s post-parliamentary job hunt appears to have begun in earnest on 22 May 2010, 11 days after Labour lost power, the latest tranche of Epstein files suggest.Days after losing his role as a cabinet minister, Mandelson wrote to Epstein to say that he was due to meet Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore’s billionaire chief executive, later that day. Mandelson highlighted Glasenberg’s 30% stake in another mining company, Xstrata, which he said “may be looking [for] a chairman”.Mandelson said that throwing his hat in the ring was “Nat[’s] idea”, understood to be a reference to his friend, the financierNat Rothschild, who was an investor in the mining industry and knew Glasenberg.Sources close to Rothschild said he spoke to multiple people about the role and that they may have included Mandelson.The following month, Mandelson wrote to Epstein, saying: “No call from Glasenberg. Cross.”View image in fullscreenMandelson (left) and Epstein (right) in an image released by the US justice department.Photograph: US Department of Justice/ReutersThe friends appear to have begun considering other options, including an opportunistic bid to take a senior role at BP, which was mired in crisis asoil from its doomed Deepwater Horizon riggushed into the Gulf of Mexico.Epstein told Mandelson that he should offer to “be in charge of this crisis, in all aspects”.Mandelson responded: “Just to be clear […] I come in fireman role as highly paid adviser etc?”But emails between the pair indicate that their priority was Glencore, as it geared up for a stock market float that was expected to make tens of millions of pounds for its directors and investors.In June, as they discussed a separate job offer that the former Labour cabinet minister had received from Deutsche Bank, Epstein advised that “we can leverage against Glencore”.A day later, the disgraced financier added: “My suggestion is for you to tell Nat, so that he can tell Glencore,” apparently indicating a plan to get Rothschild to inform Glencore that Mandelson had other offers.Then, in July, Mandelson pitched his services directly to Glasenberg in a lengthy cover letter that referenced the two men having met in London.Mandelson described himself as an “experienced pair of hands” with a lot to offer Glencore ahead of its stock market float, planned for 2011.“I am keen aged 56 to re-tooll myself to one major opportunity and not pursue a wide range of interests like many people in my position tend to do,” he wrote in one typo-ridden email.“But the more specific value I beliieve I can bring to Glencore is a knowledge of politics, government and regulatory trends which are ggoing to have more and more bearing on a company like Glencore.”“In the coming decade and beyond, business is goiing to have to face a lot more government attention and interference,” he added, highlighting the risk to businesses with “environmental and political impact”.Glencore would go on to attract significant scrutiny with regard to its tax affairs, environmental impact and relationship with communities in the often remote parts of the world where it owned mines and trade commodities such as oil and metals.Glasenberg wrote back the same day to say he would be having a meeting with Glencore’s partners that week regarding the float and “you joining our company as the chairman”.On 10 April the following year, Epstein asked Mandelson for an update on progress with Glencore, prompting the response: “No word.”Days later, the former French foreign legionnaire Simon Murray was announced as chair.Sources familiar with the selection process indicated that, in fact, Mandelson had never been in with a chance of chairing Glencore during the flotation.However, Mandelson did go on to secure a role for his own company, Global Counsel, providing Glencore with “strategic advice”.The former Labour peer, who once said he was “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich”, followed his former boss Tony Blair by taking paid work for Glencore.Blair is thought to have earned more than £250,000 in 2012 for a cameo role, lasting just hours, in helping to negotiate a settlement between Glencore and the Qatari state to secure a £45bn merger with Xstrata.The Guardian has approached Mandelson for comment.

Inclusion in the files does not imply wrongdoing or knowledge of Epstein’s wrongdoing – but a sampling of some of the details they include provides extraordinary detail on the extent of his network.1.Norway’s crown princess and Epstein’s ‘wife hunt’The latest tranche of files has linked Norway’s Crown Princess Mette-Marit to Epstein, appearing to show her extensive contact with the disgraced financier from 2011 to 2014.According tothe Norwegian daily VG, Mette-Marit told Epstein that “you tickle my brain” in onemessageandcalledhim “soft hearted” and “such a sweetheart”in others.In 2012, Mette-Marit told Epstein he was “very charming”and askedif it was “inappropriate for a mother to suggest two naked women carrying a surfboard for my 15 yr old sons wallpaper?”Weeks earlier she and Epsteinhad exchanged emailsabout him being on a “wife hunt” in Paris. She replied that the French capital was “good for adultery” and added that “Scandis (are) better wife material”.The files include a 2011exchangein which Mette-Marit told Epstein that she had “Googled” him, adding “it didn’t look too good” along with a smiling emoji.Mette-Marit, whomarriedthe future king of Norway in 2001, has said that she “showed poor judgment and “deeply regret[ted] having had any contact with Epstein”. A spokesperson for Norway’s royal family said Mette-Marit had ended written contact with Epstein in 2014 as she felt he was “trying to use his relationship with the crown princess as leverage with other people”.2.Deepak Chopra’s view of alleged victimView image in fullscreenChopra attended intimate dinner parties at Epstein’s New York residence, in the presence of Woody Allen, and called his nights out ‘a blast’.Photograph: Astrid Stawiarz/Getty ImagesEpstein appears to have taken great pride in improving his spiritual health. The papers detail his long relationship with holistic healer and new age wellness guru Deepak Chopra, whom he met at least 12 times between 2016 and 2019 for “meditation and funding meetings” for alternative science health projects. Chopra attended intimate dinners parties at Epstein’s New York residence, in the presence of Woody Allen, and called his nights out “a blast”.In November 2016, Epstein sent Chopra a report saying that a “troubled woman with a history of drug use” made up allegations that she was assaulted by Trump and Epstein, aged 13. When Epstein passed on that she had dropped the civil charges against him, Chopra replied: “Good.”In a statement,Chopra said: “I hope that all of the truth comes out after ongoing and proper investigations. I’m happy to share whatever I know with authorised officials.”3.Epstein’s warning over Mandelson’s memoirPeter Mandelson, the former UK ambassador to the US, is now under police investigation for misconduct in public office over revelations in the Epstein files. He described Epstein as his “chief life adviser”, and appears to have sent him a draft of his memoir, The Third Man: Life at the heart of New Labour in May 2010.The financier was concerned that the gossipy nature of the manuscript would damage Mandelson’s potential for dealmaking in his post-political life.He wrote: “I think we should speak about this book … I have finished my first read. (yes, that fast, that’s what i do) … I find it troubling.”Epstein said the book risked driving “a commercial stake through your heart” as “the deals you want to be involved in require, discretion, trust, handshakes, privacy”.He went on: “This book announces that you are willing to sell all of these for a farthing. Your friend, and boss, Tony is more often described as frail, flustered, tired, weak, and Gordon [as] flawed, demanding, pig-headed, irrationally determined, and you, yourself as – wanting to “come clean”, humiliated, distraught, surprised, pleased, thoughtful, aggressive, hurt … My view is that businessmen will revolt … It is not uplifting, it is gossipy and defensive.”Mandelson appears not to have agreed: “You have read it too fast. It is not those things. Nor is it finished.”He maintains that he has not acted criminally, and was not motivated by financial gain. He has said that he was deceived by Epstein, whom he characterises as a “master manipulator”.4.Former Israeli PM’s admiration of defence dealsEhud Barak is mentioned repeatedly in the files, which make clear the former Israeli prime minister and special forces soldier stayed in regular contact with Epstein for many years after the financier’s 2008 guilty plea for sex crimes in Florida.Among the correspondence are plans for a 2017 stay at Epstein’s New York residence. Other exchanges discussmundane logisticsfor other visits, dinner dates, meetings and phone calls with Epstein.View image in fullscreenEhud Barak has acknowledged regularly visiting Epstein on his trips to New York and flying on his private plane.Photograph: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty ImagesInone letterto Epstein among those reportedly compiled as a birthday gift for the convicted criminal’s 63rd birthday in 2016, Barak and his wife wrote “there is no limit to your curiosity”.“You are like a closed book to many of them but you know everything about everyone,” they wrote, describing Epstein as “A COLLECTOR OF PEOPLE”.Epstein also mentioned Barak to others, saying that he was “next level” when it came to arranging deals in the defence industry.Barak has acknowledged regularly visiting Epstein on his trips to New York and flying on his private plane, but maintains he never saw or learned of any inappropriate or unlawful behaviour.5.Billionaire CEO’s request for Jared Kushner meetingThe files suggest that Anil Ambani, the billionaire CEO of the sprawling India-based multinational conglomerate the Reliance Group, first contacted Epstein in early 2017. For more than two years, the two immensely wealthy men exchanged messages on Skype, email and SMS on topics ranging from geopolitics to how to choose a jacket.Ambani, 66, appears to have been introduced to the late child sex offender by a Gulf-based businessman, according tothe News Minute, an Indian news website.After possibly meeting in France in February 2017, they then exchanged emails full of mutual compliments and talk about potential deals and useful contacts.In March 2017, Ambani told Epstein that “Leadership [in Delhi]” wanted access to Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, and Steve Bannon, the far-right ideologue who was then the president’s adviser, before a proposed visit to Washington by Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister. There was also discussion of Modi’s forthcoming trip to Israel.The Indian Ministry of External Affairs has denied any official knowledge of any consultation of Epstein by Ambani, tellingthe Hindunewspaper that the “allusions in the email are little more than trashy ruminations by a convicted criminal, which deserve to be dismissed with the utmost contempt”.There is no evidence from the files that Ambani knew of or had any involvement in Epstein’s unlawful activities.6.Rulebook for Epstein’s Florida mansionView image in fullscreenJeffrey Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion.Photograph: Miami Herald/TNS/Getty ImagesGlimpses of this document were revealed at Ghislaine Maxwell’s 2021 trial, but Epstein’s full “household manual” was included in the latest release, detailing strict, cult-like requirements for his Florida mansion staff, who were expected to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing”.Other rules said that air conditioning should be kept at 60F at all times, guns should be provided in bedside drawers, required large quantities of tissues and toothpaste to be kept in bathrooms, and mandated a “vibe check” – specific rules for the provision and placement of sex toys.7.Epstein’s definition of ‘freedom’Mandelson has said he regrets not believing the women abused by Epstein. The financier’s behaviour does not seem to have been that well concealed.It was July 2009, and Epstein had just been released from Palm Beach County Jail after serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence after being convicted of soliciting prostitution and soliciting prostitution from a child. “How is freedom feeling?” asked Mandelson. “She feels fresh firm and creamy,” Epstein said.“Naughty boy,” Mandelson responded. The Labour cabinet minister went on: “How shall we celebrate?” Epstein wrote back: “With Grace and Modesty (those are the names of two strippers).” Mandelson responded: “From now on grace and modesty [should] be discovered in London.”8.Epstein’s ‘friend’ for AndrewView image in fullscreenThe then-Prince Andrew, pictured in the summer of 2010, when Epstein suggested the royal might enjoy having dinner with a 26-year-old Russian woman he described as ‘clever, beautiful, trustworthy’.Photograph: Steve Parsons/PAIt was the summer of 2010, and Epstein had an idea for the then-Prince Andrew – now Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor after he was stripped of his royal titles over his relationship with Epstein.“I have a friend who I think you might enjoy having dinner with,” Epstein wrote. “Her name is Irina, she will be in London 20-24.” The royal was only too pleased to accommodate, appearing to have written that he would be “delighted to see her”. “Will she be bringing a message from you?”, he asked. “Please give her my contact details to get in touch.”Andrew apparently recognised that the woman might not be a close friend. “Any other information you might know about her that might be useful to know? Like what have you told her about me and have you given her my email as well?” he asked. Epstein reassured him: “She is 26, Russian, clever, beautiful, trustworthy and yes she has your email.”9.Woody Allen’s Downing Street invitationEpstein offered to make dreams come true. His common refrain: “Is this important to you?” It was a deal with the devil, but the financier appeared able to deliver on what people wanted.In the summer of 2011, Ian Osborne, who ran a press relations and business development consultancy business, appears to have forwarded an email to Epstein from 10 Downing Street. “Hi – a funny one this. But Steve and I are really keen to meet up with Woody Allen. I doubt (sic) suppose you know someone who knows someone who knows him, do you?”In an email, Osborne explained the context to Epstein: “Just in case your friend Woody Allen is interested … this is from David Cameron’s office… Rohan Silva, head of the prime minister’s policy unit and Steve Hilton, director of strategy.”“Would Cameron be there?” Epstein responded. Osborne appears to have said this would be organised. “Yes, we would arrange it so that Cameron would be there for at least part of his time at No 10”. Epstein was happy to pull some strings. “If it’s important to you, I will strongly encourage,” he wrote.10.Bannon asks: ‘Do you think you’re the devil himself?’The documents provide a high level of insight into Epstein’s close relationship with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, in which Bannon acted as a mentor for Epstein’s upcoming appearances in a documentary series designed to salvage his public image.Bannon would advise on personal grooming, including the length of beard he felt Epstein should have. In return Epstein provided Bannon with high-end gifts, including a Hermès Apple watch.1:43'Do you think you're the devil himself': Epstein defends philanthropy in Bannon interview – videoIn one 2019 exchange, Bannon appears to have offered his advice on how to change Epstein’s reputation, apparently writing: “First we need to push back on the lies”, “crush the pedo/trafficking narrative”, and “rebuild your image as philanthropist”.Ina video of an interviewreleased as part of the new files, Bannon asks him: “Do you think you’re the devil himself?” Epstein replies: “No, but I do have a good mirror.” When told he has “all the attributes of the devil” and pressed further, he says: “The devil scares me.”Bannon has not yet commented publicly on the latest files.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinSteve BannonPeter MandelsonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There was the swipe at “transgender insanity”, a rant against bird-killing wind farms, an account of Greenland as “the biggest piece of ice in the world” and a boast that “we have a military where they all look like Tom Cruise only bigger”.There were insults too. Thomas Massie, the Republican representative of Kentucky, was dismissed as a “moron”, and there was the eternal dilemma of whether to call Trump’s predecessor “Sleepy Joe” or “Crooked Joe”. Trump described Barack Obama as “divisive”yet also observed: “I don’t know how a person of faith can vote for a Democrat.”There was the obligatory lie that the 2020 election was “rigged” and some crowing about 2024: “I had to win it. I needed it for my own ego. I would have had a bad ego for the rest of my life. Now I really have a big ego. Beating these lunatics was incredible.”There was also a glimpse into Trump’s sleeping habits. Recalling a past trip to Iraq during his first term, he mused: “I don’t sleep on planes. I don’t like sleeping on planes. You know, I like looking out the window watching for missiles and enemies, actually.”And Trump, 79, welcomed two special guests. He described Bukele, 44, the self-styled world’s coolest dictator, as “one of my favourite people” and “a great ally”, noting: “He operates rather large prisons.”Then Trump said: “We’re joined today by a very, very brave and wonderful man. The president of the Congo. President – ” It was a dying fall.Trump very evidently couldn’t rememberFélix Tshisekedi’sname, which at least spared everyone from a mangled pronunciation. Instead he went with: “The president, would you stand up please?” Tshisekedi, placed next to Mike Johnson, the House speaker, at the top table with a golden tablecloth, rose as people clapped. “You’re a brave man,” Trump said, clearly still clueless as to the president’s name.So far, so secular. But once in a while the most notorious liar in politics does turn out to be the way and the truth and the life.At one point on Tuesday he recalled how, when he ran for president a decade ago, the southern Baptist pastorRobert Jeffressoffered this frank assessment of him: “He may not be as good with the Bible as some of them. He may not have read the Bible as much as some of them. In fact, he may not have ever read the Bible, but he will be a much stronger messenger for us and he will get things done that no other man has the ability to get done.”Trump added: “You know, I didn’t want to admit anything, but that was very interesting and I think we’ve gotten more done than anybody could have ever gotten done.”There, in a nutshell, was the devil’s pact thatRepublicansand rightwing evangelicals have made. Trump is the Persian king Cyrus the Great, who might not embody Christian values yet is God’s chosen instrument to achieve a particular purpose – namely, turning the tide against liberal, godless America. No matter if some of the Ten Commandments get smashed up along the way.Forty years ago, the then leader of the Republican party, Ronald Reagan,said the late crewof the space shuttle Challenger “slipped the surly bonds of earth” to “touch the face of God”. Trump’s theology is somewhat different.“Religion,” he mused. “You have to believe in something. You have to believe that what we’re doing, there’s a reason for it. There has to be a reason for it. We’re all working and we’re doing, we’re behaving. I mean, I behave because I’m afraid not to, OK, because I don’t want to get in trouble.”In a creepy,recently released video interview, Steve Bannon asked Jeffrey Epstein if he was the devil. None of the true believers at Tuesday’s prayer breakfast dared ask that about Trump, who may not have read the Bible but has convinced himself he is on messianic mission and will ride the golden escalator to heaven. “I really think I probably should make it,” he said. “I mean, I’m not a perfect candidate but I did a hell of a lot of good for perfect people.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe US politics sketchEl SalvadorChristianityReligionRepublicansUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

More than 30 Iranian military commanders were killed, and 160 strikes on Iranian military targets undertaken.On 22 June the US, using B-2s and 30 Tomahawk missiles, hit Iran’s three major nuclear sites at Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz, eviscerating its nuclear programme. In September UN-wide sanctions were reimposed on the country after the European powers ended their objections to this step. In January Trump tightened the screw by imposing a tariff of 25% on goods from countries that trade with Iran.War, a Trump-imposed deal or internal regime collapse: for Tehran, none of the options are good | Sanam VakilRead moreAll this has had a real-world impact. Since June Iran’s currency has more than halved in value against the dollar, and food inflation is heading towards three figures. These were two of the factors that sparked the nationwide protests in January that revealed the willingness of the security services to slaughter thousands of fellow Iranians. Such is the government’s anxiety at the public mood, it is still filtering the internet more than a month after the censorship started.Iran’s diplomats are hardly behaving as if the government was last month on the brink of collapse, or even now fears a return to a conflict with the US that might bring the protesters back on to the streets for the final battle. Instead it acts as if it can dictate the parameters of the talks with the US,their venueand their main topic.Iran’s negotiators are hugely experienced and never show a trace of weakness. Anything negotiable is negotiated. “One more thing” is their favourite phrase, according to Wendy Sherman, the chief negotiator for the US nuclear deal in 2013-15. Iran’s negotiating team was legalistic, full of stamina, well prepared and tough, Sherman recalled.Nevertheless, it is surprising how confident Tehran seems that the Oman talks will not immediately collapse, and if they do that the government will survive.The simplest explanation for Iran’s hardball tactics is that the regime simply does not believe Trump will carry out his threat to attack given the perils of doing so. The reprisals by Iran on Israel and US military bases could be disproportionate, and lead to fresh tensions between Washington and the Gulf states angry that the US has destabilised the region.Hamidreza Azizi, a visiting fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, said: “There seems to be a consensus among the Islamic Republic security elite that President Trump doesn’t want prolonged and messy wars at high cost. So the only thing they have to do is to make sure that it’s going to be as unpredictable, as messy and as expensive in terms of human cost and economic cost as possible.”But there is a further explanation. Iran does not believe Trump has a strategy for change inside Iran, or any interest as yet in linking up with the opposition inside and outside Iran.It is unlikely a politician as instinctive as Trump would ever have something as elevated as theory of change in a society as complex as Iran, but the administration seems to have little idea how the political gravity on the ground might shift if the US bombs start to drop.As recently as last week Marco Rubio was disarmingly frank that the US did not have a plan. “I don’t think anyone can give you a simple answer as to what happens next in Iran if the supreme leader and the regime were to fall, other than the hope that there would be some ability to have somebody within their system that you could work towards a similar transition,” he told the Senate foreign relations committee.Comparing Iran with Venezuela, he said: “I would imagine it would be even far more complex than the one we’re describing now, because you’re talking about a regime that’s been in place for a very long time.”Supporters of Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed Shah of Iran, and other figures in the diaspora, insist a US attack can galvanise the masses to return to the streets, and despite the thousands arrested and killed, the crowds, their resolve hardened by the loss of loved ones, will be better organised and prepared.“Iranians want the regime to be bombed,” said one of Pahlavi’s closest supporters, Saeed Ghasseminejad. The security forces will, under this theory, lose the political will to commit a second massacre, especially if the Iranian government was shown to have spurned a chance to strike a nuclear deal.Other dissidents inside Iran can see the case for foreign intervention even if they would prefer if it was endorsed by the UN. The human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh told Iranwire: “As for public sentiment inside Iran, many people are waiting for this strike. Many who have been driven to the brink see it as their last hope. When a society feels completely powerless against tyranny, it begins to look outward.”Many of the strongest statements from dissidents inside Iran reject external intervention. They include those by Mir Hossein Mousavi, the former Iranian prime minister and Green Movement leader, as well as the collective known as Group of 17, including the Nobel prize winner Narges Mohammadi and Mehdi Mahmoudian, the Oscar nominated screenwriter. Mousavi, 83, who is under house arrest, said he wanted a peaceful and democratic transition of power. He is less clear how that can be achieved given the repression under way.Mahmoudian told the BBC that no patriotic Iranian would ever support an external attack on their country. He warned that war would undermine domestic democratic agency, deepen social divisions and prevent a domestic democratic transition built round a referendum.But this does not mean these opponents of foreign intervention are passive or defeatist.The statement of the 17 issued on 2 January was unequivocal in demanding change that was neither reformism or revolution. “Iran can only be saved by prosecuting those responsible for the repression, ending this inhumane system, and enabling the people to determine their political future in a democratic manner,” the statement said.Three of the 17 signatories have now been arrested on charges of helping Mousavi draft his statement. Vida Rabbani, one of the three arrested, is said to be refusing to cooperate with the authorities in jail. Mohammadi, arrested separately, says she is on hunger strike.Even longtime advisers to Pahlavi worry that the call for the population to take to the streets was a mistake.Trump, for the moment, seems to have lost interest in those in jail or seeking radical change inside Iran. That may change, however, if the Iranian negotiators overplay their hand in Oman.Explore more on these topicsIranUS foreign policyDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

She is the silent but terrifying snake-headed Medusa, and one of the surprises in an exhibition at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam revolving around Greek and Roman myths.View image in fullscreenForce of nature … room inspired by Leda and the Swan in the Metamorphoses exhibition.Photograph: Albertine Dijkema/RijksmuseumWhile the show features rarely lent works from masters such as Caravaggio, Bernini, Rodin and Brâncuși, it marries them with modern artists who reinterpret the legends where male gods do all they can to get their wicked way and the powerless are punished. Transgender bodies, bare breasts and even a volcanic vulva appear in artworks inspired by Roman poet Ovid’s masterpiece, Metamorphoses.Taco Dibbits, general director of the Rijksmuseum, believes the 200 myths and legends from this ancient epic poem still speak to our uncertain times. “The Metamorphoses have inspired artists for over 2,000 years and the subject is very relevant today, when everything is changing,” he says. “Things are morphed into other forms. People morph into other people. It’s about the force of nature and giving an explanation to our passions, to our sadness, to our fears. That’s what makes it so intensely human.”The show features plaster models by Auguste Rodin, with figures emerging from crude rock like the female sculpture created by Pygmalion in Ovid’s legend, who comes to life. There is a room inspired by Leda and the Swan, with Zeus “seducing” the Spartan queen by taking the bird’s form.It also includes a rare loan from the Louvre. Gian Lorenzo Bernini’s 17th-century carving of Sleeping Hermaphroditus – which sets an ancient Roman sculpture of a hermaphrodite with male and female sexual organs on a lifelike marble mattress – was inspired by Ovid’s story of a couple’s bodies merging in sexual union.There are some uncomfortable outcomes for women in the tales. Jupiter assumes the form of a cloud or shower of gold to impregnate his female target. As one explanatory board admits: “His loves are rarely tender – more often coercive and one-sided.”View image in fullscreenFluid gender … Gian Lorenzo Bernini’s 17th-century carving of Sleeping Hermaphroditus.Photograph: Amie Galbraith/RijksmuseumModern artists, particularly women, give another point of view: South African sculptor Nandipha Mntambo’s 2009 bronze of Jupiter as a bull is cast into a powerful, female form. The story of Arachne, who challenged the goddess Minerva to a weaving contest and was eventually transformed into a spider, becomes a massive bronze spider statue created by the late French-American artist Louise Bourgeois.A room about chaos and creation features Cuban-American artist Ana Mendieta’sBirth (Gunpowder Works). It depicts a female body made from earth and water, with what the gallery describes as a large “vulva-like form containing smouldering ash”.View image in fullscreenFresh point of view … Nandipha Mntambo’s 2009 bronze of Jupiter as a bull seen through a Louise Bourgeois spider.Photograph: Albertine Dijkema/RijksmuseumFrits Scholten, senior curator of sculpture, says there is a level of modern discomfort with the sexualisation of rape in some of Ovid’s stories and the art they inspired. “All these early stories in Ovid were reinterpreted by each generation and our generation looks at them in a different way,” he says. “We do address the fact that it’s often not very friendly to women.“At the same time, we say that you have to be nuanced in your view: these were scenes from fantasy, from ancient fairy tales, and they were often symbolic. I’m not saying that they are OK, but they exist, they are part of our culture and part of our history.”Scholten points to a copy of a painting of Leda and the Swan, once created by the Italian Renaissance master Michelangelo. “That’s a bedchamber piece,” he said. “You can be fairly sure that it hung over a bed in a palace in Italy. The original one by Michelangelo went to France and was destroyed by the French queen – she didn’t like it. So it is about power.”In celebrating these stories of change and transformation, Dibbits says the exhibition is ultimately about hope. “It gives a form to our fears, to the violence change often brings forth, but also the softness and the sweetness of it,” he says. “Everything undergoes a metamorphosis but the soul stays. That’s the hope: we haven’t lost our souls.”Metamorphoses is at the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam,from 6 February to 25 MayExplore more on these topicsMuseumsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Consider, however, that multiple actors have won more than one Oscar. (Emma Stone, one of this year’s best actress nominees, won twice in the past decade.) Only a single cat, meanwhile, has twice won the Patsy – the Picture Animal Top Star of the Year. (The award, given by the American Humane Association, not to be confused with the Humane Society, was discontinued in 1986.) That cat is Orangey, the subject of a small retrospective at New York City’s Metrograph cinema. Plenty of rep houses will play a movie like Breakfast at Tiffany’s around Valentine’s Day; the Metrograph is going deeper into the Orangey catalogue for a wider variety of titles and genres.‘I’m so co-o-old’: ahead of Wuthering Heights, the 20 best films with dreadful weather – ranked!Read moreBreakfast at Tiffany’s does offer Orangey his most famous role: the rather less colorfully named Cat, pet of Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), who calls him a “poor slob without a name”. Orangey features heavily in the film’s climax, when Holly releases her pet into an alley as she prepares to leave town, only to have Paul (George Peppard) rush to retrieve him. It completes a running thread that Cat is a part of Holly’s wildness as well as her potential domestication. What better animal, of course, than one equally prone to draping himself over his makeshift mistress and making yowling leaps around her apartment?The Audrey Hepburn classic won Orangey his second Patsy; his first was for a bigger role in Rhubarb, a comedy from a decade earlier about a cat that inherits ownership of an eccentric rich man’s estate, including a Brooklyn baseball team. This sounds like a proto-Air Bud – there’s nothing in the rulebook that says a cat can’t own a baseball team! – but Rhubarb appears to have been made with adults at least nominally in mind. It’s a 50s screwball comedy, which is to say it’s pokier than its classic-era counterparts from a decade earlier, and feels padded out (if still amusing) at 95 minutes. Still, Orangey steals plenty of scenes; even more than in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, this cat leaps heedlessly between furniture items, at one point parking himself atop a chandelier. He’s far more memorable than his agreeable two-legged co-stars.View image in fullscreenJan Sterling, Orangey and Ray Milland in Rhubarb.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyHuman stars do maintain one advantage, though. There is only one Audrey Hepburn and there are, admittedly, somewhere between two and 40 Orangeys. At least two cats actually played Cat in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, and in general it’s difficult to draw any straight lines across Orangey’s biologically feasible but logistically questionable 16 years of credits. Deeper research into his career tends to lead to conflicting reports. Film-maker and critic Dan Sallitt wrote a bit about Orangey forFilmmaker Magazine, locating a passage from the book Amazing Animal Actors explaining that the making of Rhubarb actually involved recruiting a whopping 60 different-but-similar-looking cats – the movie is in black-and-white, so perhaps a precisely matching hue was not a great concern – and selecting 36 particularly trainable cats, each doing an assigned trick, to create a single composite performance. (This only defies belief in that, as much as Rhubarb the cat does in the movie, I’m not sure we see 36 distinct tricks.) A contemporaneousNew York Times articleputs the number of Rhubarbs at 10, though director Arthur Lubin does describe a “principal” cat who bit him, prompting the director to “retaliate with a shrewd kick” while the Humane Association representative wasn’t looking. This does seem compatible with the Rhubarb character, who is largely disagreeable at first.Feed them, love them and play them drum’n’bass: vets’ tips for keeping pets happy and healthyRead moreWatching the cat performances both within the movies and across the different titles certainly lends credence to the idea that Orangey was more a cat type, provided by trainer Frank Inn, than a specific animal. Two films in the Metrograph retrospective showcase Orangey’s genre versatility: he supposedly has a small part in the western Stranger on Horseback, and more of a supporting role in the horror goof The Comedy of Terrors – both films directed by Jacques Tourneur, who also, appropriately enough, made the 1942 classic Cat People. (That was before your time, Orangey.) But despite the shared director, these two cats seemingly aren’t much alike in temperament or performance style. The animal in Horseback lounges around a lawman’s office like an unbothered and casually cuddly bodega cat; the one in Terrors (made when Orangey would have been at least 13) zips around with the vigor of a cat half his age. Maybe he was invigorated by the prospect of sharing scenes with an all-star cast of horror icons; with Vincent Price, Basil Rathbone, Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre on hand, this may be Orangey’s most stacked ensemble (due respect to Ms Hepburn).It’s more fun, of course, to imagine Orangey embarking upon a singular 16-year career, rather than flitting in and out of random scenes from various films. In that sense, his spiritual successor is the orange-ish cat fromInside Llewyn Davis, also played by several felines, described by director Joel Coen as“a pain in the ass.”As Coen says, dogs often want to please people; cats have little such interest, which of course only winds up drawing our attention further. It’s like watching a baby in a movie; you’re struck by the cuteness and then, perhaps, by the uncanny sensation that for a moment you’re watching someone on screen who cannot actually be acting in the traditional sense. For the babies and the cats, the scenes are real, regardless of whether they involve absurd plots, murderous funeral directors or fake socialites (and also regardless of whether the cat in question cares at all). Even the most intense adult human actors are pretending. Orangey, in all of his indeterminate forms, actually lives the movies.Explore more on these topicsFilmCatsBreakfast at Tiffany'sAudrey HepburnPetsAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cardiff’s National Museum has put together a superb, daunting retrospective of the woman who is now, perhaps, the most famous Welsh artist. It is not a blow-by-blow biographical story of how she was born in Haverfordwest in 1876, how she and her brother Augustus both loved art as children, how she insisted on going to the Slade School of FineArtlike him then made her life in bohemian France. Instead, the moment you enter the show, you are plunged into her spiritual, austere existence. We meet her in the glory of her solitude, painting cats and the sparse rooms she rented in Paris and women alone in moments of calm thought.There is a row of variants of a young woman in a blue dress with long dark hair sitting weakly in an armchair, a table at her elbow, all painted in about 1920. In most there’s a cup and teapot on the table, in one it’s a bowl of soup. She looks down as she reads a letter, occasionally a book. Their titles vary too – The Letter, The Seated Woman, The Convalescent.Their brilliance lies in what they don’t show. There are no hats covered with fruit, no chatting crowds, no omnibus, none of the anecdotal details other British artists of her generation tended to get distracted by. John cuts out the social flab and paints the essence of inner experience, the woman’s sorrow, illness, despair, recovery as she sips and reads.View image in fullscreenBattered by life … Portrait of Mrs Atkinson, 1898.Photograph: AlamyIt took enormous intelligence and decisiveness to paint so purely. Her earliest works are hardly more crowded than her maturest ones. Mrs Atkinson, painted in about 1898, sits in Victorian black, her elderly face battered by life, her eyes unsmiling, the precise details of hearth and wallpaper behind her underlining the bleak truth. Portraits of John’s friend Dorelia on their first trip together to France are already pared down, purified, mystical. John has begun her great renunciation. She will only paint what is essential.Not that she’s an artist without passion or desire. She was more than a little in love with Dorelia, whom she portrays in a warm golden lamp glow at night in Toulouse. When John stayed on in Paris, getting work as a nude artist’s model including in the studio of Auguste Rodin, she started an affair with the already world-famous pioneer of modern sculpture. Her study of Rodin’s leonine face is here. So is Rodin’s portrait of her, a bronze head craggily textured by inner turmoil. He didn’t just look at her body after all.View image in fullscreenThe glory of solitude … Seated Tortoiseshell Cat.Photograph: Robin Maggs/By permission of Amgueddfa Cymru – Museum WalesFor an artist interested in stripping reality to basics, it made sense to dispense with clothes. She may have been a child of VictorianWalesbut she saw nudity as natural. The two versions of her Self-Portrait, Nude, Sketching, from about 1908-9, use brownish paper and in one case white gouache like Rodin’s drawings, but here the nude is the artist. John is cool and unabashed as she stands naked with sketchbook in hand, studying herself in a mirror.She has the same drive to escape the repressive, claustrophobic dishonesty of the world she was born into that drove male modernists of her time – Rodin but also Matisse, Klimt, Schiele. Clothes symbolise social trappings, hierarchies, lies that define and oppress. Better to be free and truthful, if a little chilly in an unheated Paris room. Yet in her search for a simplicity beyond social fuss, John was also attracted to the opposite, represented in a stunning row of portraits of nuns, their faces framed by white triangular headdresses.View image in fullscreenThe only smile in the show … Mère Poussepin Seated at a Table, 1913-1920.Photograph: By permission of Amgueddfa Cymru – Museum WalesThese nuns were members of a Catholic religious community at Meudon, in the Paris suburbs, where John moved in 1911. She converted to Catholicism and was keen to serve the church artistically. Her nuns are paradoxically individualist: each woman comes across as characterful and unique inside her religious uniform. One, based on a print of the community’s 17th-century founder Mother Marie Poussepin, even smiles – the only smile in the show.John’s mysticism doesn’t stop at nuns. The blue her young women wear so often is, in Christian art, the colour of purity and heaven. In The Pilgrim, a woman sits meditatively in a huge blue cape as if ready to set out on a sacred quest that will be hard, lonely, necessary.In 1935 she wrote from Meudon to a curator at this museum after it bought its first work by her. “I am very happy and honoured that you have bought one of my little paintings for the museum,” she says in a note that is framed here. And they truly are “little”. This is an exhibition of small pictures in pale colours, so subtle they are almost spectral, a misty gathering of silent women in small rooms and long-dead cats. But in its emotional power, the art of Gwen John is enormous, heavy, even crushing. Wales does full justice to its great modern artist.Gwen John: Strange Beauties is atNational Museum, Cardiff, from 7 February to 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingWalesreviewsShareReuse this content"

The founders of the startup Superpower store vials of peptides in theiroffice fridgefor convenient, lunchtime backside injections, and at least one San Francisco “peptide rave” has seen partygoers entertained by a lab-coated man demonstrating how to inject liquid peptides.What are injectable peptides, exactly?Peptides are short chains of amino acids – smaller versions of proteins – that play a role in regulating hormones, releasing neurotransmitters and repairing tissue, explains Adam Taylor, director of the Clinical Anatomy Learning Centre at Lancaster University. More than 100 Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs are peptide-based, including insulin and newer GLP-1 medications like Ozempic.Black sesame is growing more popular in the US. Is it actually good for you?Read moreGrey-market injectable peptides, on the other hand, are unapproved by the FDA. The unregulated, experimental compounds lack reliable safety data and quality control. Sometimes, these substances are essentially bootleg versions of approved drugs, like semaglutide, but are procured for a fraction of their market price from dealers online.While some injectable peptides are entirely foreign to the human body, others, like BPC-157 and TB-500, are synthetic versions of proteins that naturally occur in us, where they play a role in tissue and cellular repair.“Those two are popular because when you combine them, they’ve been given the exciting name ‘Wolverine stack’, based on the supposed similarities to the film character’s regenerative properties,” says Taylor.But just because a protein has a natural role in the body doesn’t mean that a lab-made version will confer extra benefits. “Those two compounds alone have never been shown to have any benefit to justify them being used therapeutically in humans,” says Taylor.While preclinical animal and in vitrostudiessuggest some peptides may help speed recovery from musculoskeletal injuries like fractures and torn ligaments, animal studies don’t always translate to humans.“We’re not seeing data that’s setting the world alight,” says Taylor.So far, research trials haven’t prompted regulatory agencies to approve these substances or convinced companies to invest in further development. “Obviously [pharmaceutical companies] don’t see it as a market worth the research and development costs,” Taylor says.What are the risks of injecting grey-market peptides?The FDAwarnsthey pose “serious safety risks”, including allergic reactions. The federal agency has banned their production by US compounding pharmacies, though personal use is legal.The risks of injecting grey-market peptides begin with their lack of precision. These substances can’t be targeted to a specific area and may instead “activate pathways in tissues and systems that are actually detrimental to health”, says Taylor.Because these proteins are associated with tissue growth, there is a risk that if you’ve got an early-stage cancer developing that you didn’t know about, peptides could accelerate its advancement, he says.Other risks include acromegaly, an excess of growth hormone that leads to the problematic enlargement of bones, cartilage and organs. And botching a DIY injection can cause muscle paralysis, scarring and sepsis.Furthermore, the “label of chemically identical is often misleading”, says Nitai Gelber, a Toronto-based sports medicine physician. A peptide may contain a portion of protein chemically identical to something our bodies naturally produce, but “there’s often other components that are added to that molecule as well,” Gelber said, to aid in absorption, its mechanism of action or to prevent degradation. Those additions raise the risk of allergic or adverse reactions.Anecdotally, Taylor has heard complaints from people linking their grey-market peptide use to rashes, numbness and mood shifts.In July, two women werehospitalizedwith swollen tongues, breathing problems and elevated heart rates after peptide injections at a Las Vegas anti-ageing festival. The exact peptides involved are unknown.How are people getting them if they’re banned in the US?Grey-market peptides are typically sold online and labelled “for research purposes only”, as a legal loophole.A large proportion come from China, where imports of hormone and peptide compounds have increased dramatically: US customs data shows they hit $328m in the first three-quarters of 2025, up from $164m in the same period the previous year, the New York Timesreported.Some people source their peptides through stateside “wellness clinics” that import and redistribute the substances, potentially advertising purity testing as an add-on for safer supply.But at this point, such promises mean little. “People are signing the paperwork that says they understand the risks,” and that removes the supplier’s liability, explains Taylor. As research on peptides advances slowly, in the meantime, “people are actually converting themselves into the guinea pigs or the lab rats,” Taylor says.Who is seeking them?Gelber says he’s seen a sharp rise in interest from both athletes and non-athletes, younger and older patients alike, though predominantly men and teenage boys seeking more muscular physiques. “Over the last year it’s been nonstop,” he says of patients asking him about injectable peptides, which rarely came up before 2023, he says.Dr Avinish Reddy, a longevity-focused concierge physician based in Los Angeles, notes a similar increase in interest. “It’s become very common for patients to tell me they have friends taking a certain peptide and that they ‘swear by it’,” he says.Both doctors believe social media promoting unrealistic body aesthetics, hype from influencers such asGary BreckaandJoe Rogan, and frustration with the slow pace of conventional injury recovery are factors behind interest in products.When patients come to Reddy and Gelber using grey-market peptides, both doctors recommend they stop, and offer harm reduction advice to those who won’t. “If you’re using something experimental, your doctor needs to know so side effects aren’t missed or blamed on the wrong thing,” Reddy says.Additionally, he advises them to watch for warning signs. “If you develop fevers, reactions at the injection site, chest symptoms or new neurologic symptoms, stop immediately and seek medical care,” he says. He also warns against stacking multiple experimental products, which makes it “much harder to know what’s helping or harming you”.Injuries are often best managed via proper diagnosis, rehabilitation, training, sleep and nutrition, Reddy says. The dubious promise of peptides as cure-all supersubstances can distract patients from the fundamentals of long-term care.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealthBeautyDrugsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But what happens when the families want them back?ByAdaobi Tricia NwaubaniThu 5 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 5 Feb 2026 00.19 ESTShareEsther Stevens’ life nearly ended as soon as it began. She was born in 2007, in a village on the outskirts of Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city. Her mother died giving birth to her, and in the eyes of some villagers, that meant the baby was cursed. According to tradition, there was only one way to deal with such a child. The villagers tied the newborn to her mother’s lifeless body and prepared to bury them together.When word reached a Nigerian missionary living in the community, she rushed to the burial site and pleaded for the baby’s life. After the villagers and relatives refused, she appealed to the traditional priest who had been called on to perform the rite. “Finally, the priest agreed and said, let them give her the evil child and see what the child will become,” Esther said. “The child, that’s me.”The missionary took Esther to a children’s home in Abuja run by a Christian couple, Olusola and Chinwe Stevens, who brought her up as their own. Today, Esther is 18, tall, with a broad smile. She laughs easily and has a quick sense of humour.In Nigeria, children are widely regarded as gifts from God or the spirit world, but according to some traditional belief systems, certain children were once thought to bring misfortune. Children born with albinism, visible deformities or disabilities were said to bring curses, or to be omens sent from ancestors or deities. In parts of southern Nigeria, particularly among the Igbo, twins and triplets were feared. Although these beliefs have largely faded, in isolated pockets of the country, they persist. In some of these communities, says the human rights activist Leo Igwe, the death of the mother in childbirth is believed to be the fault of the child.The couple who run the children’s home where Esther grew up have been confronting these practices since 1996. Sent by the Christian Missionary Foundation to Abuja, the Stevenses discovered that some children were still being killed: poisoned, abandoned to starve or buried alive. In 2004, they created the Vine Heritage Home Foundation, a refuge for vulnerable children. Twenty years later, they provide a home for more than 200 children.When Nigeria moved its capital from Lagos to Abuja in 1976, the new site was presented by the government as a neutral location, symbolically distant from centres of ethnic and regional tensions. But less than 40 miles away from this gleaming modern capital, with its wide boulevards and high-rise buildings, are communities that become nearly impassable in the rainy season. Many of these communities depend largely on subsistence farming, and the few healthcare facilities are poorly equipped and understaffed. According to Olusola, 75% of the children living in Vine Heritage are there because their mothers died in childbirth. (Nigeria is “the most dangerous country in the world to give birth”,according to UN data from 2023, which shows that one in every 100 women dies during childbirth or shortly after, many from postpartum haemorrhage.)After their shocking discovery, the Stevenses began going around the communities, begging the families to hand over to them any of the “cursed” children rather than kill them. Then they began to speak with other local missionaries, asking them to spread the word that they were willing to take in any child deemed evil.One of their contacts, missionary Andrew Tonak, told me that Chinwe is one of the most open-hearted people he has met, a mother and leader whose counsel, generosity and instinct to give have touched countless lives. Tonak is 61, and has lived in Kaida village, about 40 miles west of Abuja, since 2000. He recalled visiting women who had just given birth to twins. On his next visit, he would often be told, “The children are no more. They died.” Over the years, he says he has rescued 20 children from the village and neighbouring communities.By the time some of the children now at Vine Heritage were rescued, they were already weakened by poisoning or severe malnutrition. Most required urgent medical attention. But increasingly, communities are becoming aware of the Stevenses’ work and now bring newborns to them directly, before harm can come to them.Olusola said: “On their own, they come asking, ‘Please, where is that house where they keep the children?’ And then they bring them.”Today, Vine Heritage is home to more than 200 children, from newborn to young adults. The oldest, Godiya, is 21 and has been at Vine Heritage since she was a baby. The newest arrival before my visit, a baby born on 27 May 2025, has been fighting for her life in a hospital crib since the day she was brought to the home.About four years ago, Vine Heritage moved from a cramped facility that was originally designed to accommodate 55 children, to a much larger compound in Gwagwalada, built with funding from the EU in partnership with global charity ActionAid. The home has 18 dedicated staff working in shifts to provide round-the-clock care for the babies and toddlers. In a spacious hall, everyone gathers for morning prayers, group meetings and TV time. (Like any home full of children, there’s a constant battle for control of the remote.)As I followed Olusola on a tour of the neatly laid-out grounds, he moved in a sprightly fashion, his greying beard framing a warm smile. At the youngest children’s dormitory, a chorus rang out: “Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!” They are not allowed out unaccompanied, and their small faces were pressed against the windows.View image in fullscreenEsther Stevens, 18, who has been living at the home since birth.Photograph: Adesegun Adeokun/The GuardianThe multiple-birth siblings all have names that sound alike: Victor and Victoria, Mabel and Bethel, Zion and Zipporah. Among the youngest residents are triplets named Paul, Pauline and Paulina. Their parents arrived at the home one morning about six months ago, cradling the newborns in their arms. “I asked, ‘Why did you bring them?’ They said, ‘We don’t want them to die,’” Olusola recalled. The parents have visited once since then. They love their children, but fear that if the babies remained in their village, they would be killed.Esther is clearly a favourite among the younger children. They love to follow her around and clamber on to her back, and as she and I chatted, they hovered close by. Esther knew nothing of her true origins or how she had come to live in the house until she was 14. She had been among the first children to arrive, joining the household in 2007 when there were only nine or 10 others. Olusola and Chinwe have one biological child, Praise, now 24 and studying at university. In those early years, Esther assumed she was also their biological daughter. As more children joined over time, she believed she was simply growing up in an orphanage run by her own parents. All the children bear the surname Stevens. “I knew it was an orphanage home, but I thought I was their real child. I look like mummy,” she said, and she does share some resemblance to Chinwe, with the same complexion.Esther’s illusion was shattered when members of her biological family unexpectedly arrived at the home. At the time, the missionary who had rescued her as a newborn was preparing to leave the community. Before departing, she contacted Esther’s biological family to ask if they wanted to see where she had taken their child, knowing that once she left, they might never have the chance. “My grandmother came from the village and said she wanted to see me,” Esther recalled. “She wanted to see if I was still alive. When she told my father I was alive, he came to see with his own eyes.”To prepare her for the meeting, Olusola sat her down and told her the truth about her past. “I was more than shocked,” she said quietly. “I felt sad. I felt bad.” Wanting to know more, Esther asked for her file. She read it cover to cover. What hurt most was discovering that her family had never come for her in all the 14 years she had been there. “Finding out about my parents’ true identity … It was just … I shed tears because they didn’t even care.”Kaida, a village in Gwagwalada, is the closest community to Abuja’s city centre where there is evidence that infanticide may still sometimes take place. There are no tarred roads to the village, and the route is rough and bumpy, but it is better connected than most. There is a patchy phone signal here.In Kaida, I met Abubakar Auta, a father of 13 and a husband to two wives. His twins Eric and Erica were sent to Vine Heritage about seven years ago. Like almost every adult in Kaida, Abubakar and his wife, Amina, farm for a living. To supplement their income, Amina digs sand from the river to sell to builders. She arrived to meet me straight from her work, dripping wet, sand clinging to her bare feet. Of her husband’s 13 children, seven are hers. Abubakar said he sent the twins away to “save their mother from suffering”. He believed they would not be safe in Kaida. Speaking to me in Hausa through a interpreter, he explained, “If I had left my children here, people would keep their eyes on them, and that would make them a target.” (Eric later died at the children’s home after falling ill.)Kaida village has solar power, which provides a few hours of electricity each day for its two clinics: one government-run, the other operated by missionaries trained in community health. The government facility stands silent and empty. Locals say its staff are rarely present. The missionary clinic, by contrast, is alive with activity.While I was there, a community health worker tended to a woman whose young grandson had a toe injury, the wound still raw and red. The woman had told me earlier on, in her home, that she had previously given birth to three sets of twins. All of them died within months. “They just fell sick,” she said. “In a short time, they were dead.”View image in fullscreenOlusola Stevens with some of the children at Vine Heritage Home in Gwagwalada, July 2025.Photograph: Adesegun Adeokun/The GuardianHer eldest child in his early 20s, sitting nearby, looked up and interrupted. “It was an evil hand that killed them,” he said, his tone defiant. At his words, his mother fell silent and turned her face aside, making it clear she wanted no part in that line of conversation.The village head described the killing of children as belonging to “a time when people did not know these children were human beings”. He repeatedly used the phrase “in those days” to explain that their “eyes are now open” and such killings no longer happen. (He confirmed that the practice continued until at least a little more than 10 years ago, and that his “those days” referred to the years before then. Lakai has served as village head for the past 26 years.)Community members are reluctant to speak openly, whether out of fear of stigma, distrust of outsiders, or the sensitivity of exposing cultural taboos. What I was able to piece together from these guarded, euphemistic conversations suggests that decisions involved a mix of family elders and traditional religious leaders. Leo Igwe, the human rights activist, acknowledged the role of patriarchy in situations where women surrender their babies to die. In 2019, ActionAid ran a survey in 57 villages around Abuja in which 16% of male respondents openly expressed support for the practice.The shroud of secrecy has made it hard to tackle these beliefs. When I contacted various government officials, each one said they had never heard of such practices. Infanticide is against the law, but enforcement is hampered by secrecy and denial. Arinze Orakwue worked for nearly 20 years for the state body responsible for rescuing vulnerable children. From the early 2000s, he visited many communities where infanticide is practised, meeting with traditional chiefs and local leaders in an effort to change entrenched beliefs. “Many of them are living in denial. They tell you that it used to happen in their community a long time ago but it doesn’t happen any more.”As more children were brought to their home, the Stevenses realised the scale of the problem. In 2013, when they decided to speak publicly about infanticide, the Federal Capital Territory government summoned them, accusing them of spreading falsehoods and damaging Nigeria’s image, just to attract attention and donations. Yet this scepticism faded after officials were shown clear evidence. The government eventually commissioned the couple to run awareness campaigns in the affected communities. They have built new partnerships, most notably with ActionAid. “The greatest problem is denial,” said Andrew Mamedu, ActionAid’s Nigeria head. “The community will insist, ‘Oh, there’s nothing like that.’ But when you go there, you see the evidence. You see the altars to the dead twins. Sometimes, the parents can’t account for their children. They are pregnant and before you know it, they’ve given birth and the baby is gone.”ActionAid’s approach to the problem was patient, practical and deliberately indirect. Staff set up committees in each community – made up of men and women, young people, traditional rulers and religious leaders – and framed their aim as community development. “We don’t start with infanticide because they would just drive us away,” Mamedu said. The teams began by focusing on livelihoods, education, hygiene and access to healthcare, and only then moved on to tackling infanticide, under the broader banner of maternal and child health. Committee members acted as local advocates. One of their most effective tools was radio, still the most widespread and trusted source of news in northern Nigeria.View image in fullscreenChinwe Stevens at home.Photograph: Adesegun Adeokun/The GuardianThe strategy produced some measurable gains. In two communities ActionAid’s advocacy helped secure government investment in health centres. In four communities, the killings gradually stopped. Parents who had handed over children returned to the home to ask for them back. New local “champions” began to emerge, ordinary people willing to speak up. Still, the effort had its limits. Resistance from influential elders persisted, and when funds ran short in 2022, much of the work was left unfinished.The Stevenses continue to work closely with missionaries stationed across the area. But not all rescues come through Christian networks. In Godiya’s case, it was a Muslim cleric who stepped in. “The Islamic preacher went to the community to preach and make converts, just like I do,” Olusola recalled. “He saw a child strapped to the dead body of her mother. They were preparing the grave. He asked, ‘Please, this child, what happened?’ They told him she was an evil child, and that their culture was to bury such children with their mothers. He said, ‘Can you permit me? Let me call my pastor friend so he can come and pick up the child.’ So he called me, and we went to the community and took her.”When the Stevenses first established the Vine Heritage Home, their vision was simple: to raise the rescued children as their own and, once they were older, return them to their communities so they could become agents of change in the very places that had once rejected them. In recent years, 36 children have been returned to their families. In each case, the families themselves came asking for the children. But reintegration is rarely smooth. For one thing, many of these rural communities speak local languages understood by few outsiders.When Esther visited her family in Dako village for the first time in December 2021, she met her siblings: two older brothers, two older sisters, and a younger sister. She was the only child from her mother, who had been the last of her father’s three wives. Two of her siblings were already married with children. They were glad to see her, but communication was difficult. “I couldn’t talk with them because they speak Basa,” she said. Only her elder brother could speak English, because he was in school.The contrast in education was stark. When Esther told them she was in her third year of junior secondary school, they thought she was lying; most of the people her age in the village were still in primary school.At Vine Heritage, every child goes to school. Of the current residents, 182 are enrolled, from primary and secondary pupils to university students like Godiya, who is studying sociology at Nasarawa State University, just across the border from Abuja. Godiya dreams of a career that comes with a uniform – any one will do. Esther has just finished secondary school and hopes to begin university later this year to study law. For many like her, returning to their villages would probably end those dreams.Sometimes, a compromise is possible. Fifteen-year-old Mabel and Bethel spend their school holidays in Kaida village with their family, then come back to the home once classes resume. Their family first came to reclaim them when they were 10 years old. “I was happy, but I was not happy,” Bethel said. “I was happy that I had seen the place where they gave birth to me, but I was not happy to leave here,” she added. “Whenever I go there, nobody disturbs me, but I always want to come back.”Beyond communication difficulties, the adjustment to rural life can be harsh. Children accustomed to running water, electricity and regular meals must fetch water from streams, adapt to harder living conditions, and endure the curiosity or suspicion of villagers.The Stevenses usually wait until they consider the children old enough to understand before telling them how they came to the home. When Godiya turned 17, in 2021, her people came looking for her. “At first I said I was not going to see them because for how many years they did not come,” she recalled.View image in fullscreenGloria, 11, playing with other children at Vine Heritage Home.Photograph: Adesegun Adeokun/The Guardian“It took us two hours to convince her,” Olusola said. “I pleaded with her, telling her that their coming was a sign of progress.”Since then, Godiya has stayed in touch with her family, but she only made her first trip back in January 2025. Without proper roads, the only way to reach Bari village was by motorbike. Hours after leaving Gwagwalada, she finally arrived exhausted, and the entire village gathered to stare. “Everybody was just looking at me,” she said. “I didn’t understand the language and the journey was stressful. They were speaking, but I didn’t understand them.”The youngest of nine children, Godiya was welcomed with joy by her older sisters, who embraced her through tears. They urged her to come back for Christmas, but she was dismayed by the lack of electricity or phone network, and currently has no plans to return.Esther’s experience in Dako was similar. “When I went to the village, everybody came to see me,” she said. Some of the stares unsettled her. “The community was scary. The way some villagers look at you, as if there’s some evil thought in their mind. I was so scared because I didn’t want anything to happen to me.”Sometimes, the danger is real. Four years ago, eight-year-old Monday was sent back to his village at his grandfather’s request. Monday’s mother had died giving birth to him. The family had recently converted to Christianity, and after Monday’s father remarried, the grandfather felt it was the right time to bring home the boy once deemed “evil”. But just two weeks later, Monday was returned to Vine Heritage. The elders in the village had been resentful, asking the grandfather how they should feel when others had killed their own children but he had brought his back alive. Fearing for the boy’s safety, the grandfather decided it was better for him to leave. “He called me and said, ‘I am returning your child to you,’” Olusola said.When a family asks for their child back, the Stevenses try to find out if it is safe for them to return. But they cannot prevent every tragedy. About eight years ago, the Stevenses visited a mother who had recently given birth to an albino girl. She assured them that attitudes towards albinos in her community had changed in recent years, so they did not insist on bringing the new baby to the home. “I was asking questions: has anybody threatened you or the child? She said no,” Olusola recalled. Shortly afterwards, word reached him that the baby had died without explanation. He has never been able to discover what happened.The years have taken their toll on Chinwe and Olusola. About two years ago, Chinwe’s health began to deteriorate, and Olusola urged her to move into a small flat nearby so she could focus on recovery. During school holidays, two of the oldest children, including Godiya, take turns staying with her, helping with everyday needs, while the others visit in small groups from time to time.Chinwe has had a stroke, developed high blood pressure and undergoes regular dialysis. I visited her in the modest flat where she lives alone, after spending her entire married life surrounded by dozens of children. She spoke candidly about how she poured herself into caring for others while neglecting her own health. Apart from the small income the Stevens received as missionaries, they earned nothing, relying entirely on donations to care for the children. Now, Chinwe herself depends on donations to cover her medical expenses.On the walls hang photographs of her in a graduation gown, taken when she earned her doctorate in agriculture from the prestigious University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Another, from two years ago on her 59th birthday, shows her nearly three times her current, frail size. Pointing to one, she said softly, “Look at me then, and look at me now.” She managed a wry laugh.Olusola said the home had its future leaders among the older children, those willing to step up and already involved in administration and management. Some, he explained, had made it clear that even after graduating from university, they intended to remain committed to running the home. Whenever he was away for meetings, they kept things running. Unless visitors specifically asked to see him, the children received guests, handled day-to-day operations, managed money and accounts, and reported back to him. “The only thing they can’t do is sign cheques,” he said. “I have already told them that in the next 10 years, I will sit back and the home will be in their hands.”Most donations to Vine Heritage come from individuals. On the day I visited, a donated cow stood in the compound. But with Nigeria’s soaring inflation, now at its highest in nearly three decades, many longtime supporters have cut back or stopped entirely. “Sometimes, when you phone people to remind them of their promise to pay school fees, they get irritated,” Olusola said. “Because of Nigeria’s economy, some of the people that used to support the home before are now finding it difficult.”Mamedu, at ActionAid, believes the issue is more complex. The challenge, he says, lies in how the home is run. It is neither a formal organisation nor a business. There is no business plan, governance structure, or consistent paperwork like a typical NGO or charity would have. It is registered as a foster home. There are no clear systems for tracking how funds are spent or how accounts are managed.‘For five years we dreaded every meal’: my infant son’s struggle with foodRead more“We supported the home to try to institutionalise the process,” Mamedu said. “We trained the staff on hygiene, childcare, some record keeping, even partner management. From the start, we told Olusola, let’s have a central way to account for every fund that comes in, so that when we say we don’t have money, it’s backed by proper records. But he tells us that this is not an orphanage; it’s a home.”ActionAid still supports the home, providing monthly funds for food and covering urgent medical bills for the children. But the future is uncertain. The Stevens’ family-first approach has undoubtedly saved lives and nurtured emotional bonds among the children, Mamedu believes. But the original vision of reintegrating children into their communities appears to have faltered, which means the home keeps growing. Olusola admits that he once believed those communities would be more developed by the time the children grew up. He had expected more progress.I asked Olusola if he would have done things differently. “When God asks you to do something you only obey,” he said. “It never occurred to me that we would ever have more than 20 children. After saving seven children, we had a pause of about one-and-a-half years, and we thought that would be all. We made our decision that whatever we gave to our biological child, we would give the rest.” But after the seven-year hiatus, Olusola recalled, “the floodgates opened, and more children started coming”.View image in fullscreenThe best stories take time.

We must offer a positive vision that will improve the lives of AmericansThu 5 Feb 2026 11.30 ESTLast modified on Thu 5 Feb 2026 13.47 ESTShareAt this difficult moment in American history, it’s imperative that we have the courage to be honest with ourselves.The United States, once the envy of the world, is now a nation in profound decline. For the sake of our children and future generations, we must reverse that decline and change, in very fundamental ways, the direction of our country.Not so long ago, the US was admired for its democracy, constitution, rule of law, strong middle class and an American dream which promised that our kids and grandchildren would have a better life than their parents.Tragically, that is no longer the case.We used to have the strongest and most vibrant middle class on Earth. Not any more. Today 60% of our people are living paycheck to paycheck and we have more income and wealth inequality than any other major country. Despite huge advances in technology and worker productivity, real weekly wages for the average American worker are lower today than they were 53 years ago.Donald Trump is making China great again | Steven GreenhouseRead moreWe used to be the best-educated country on Earth, with an excellent public school system and the highest percentage of young people graduating from college than any other country. Not any more. Today, the US ranks well behind its peers in overall educational attainment, our childcare system is broken and millions of our young people are unable to afford a college education.We used to have the best healthcare system in the world. Not any more. Despite spending far more per capita on healthcare than any other nation, 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured, our life expectancy is lower than most wealthy nations and we have a massive shortage in doctors, nurses, dentists, mental health counselors and other healthcare professionals.We used to be a country with decent, affordable housing. Not any more. Since the pandemic, the median home price has risen by 55% to more than $410,000. Today, more than 20m households are spending more than half of their limited incomes on housing and nearly 800,000 people are homeless. Today, young couples are buying their first home, on average, 10 years later in life than their parents.We used to have a reasonably nutritious food system. Not any more. Today, as a result of corporate agriculture and the greed of the food and beverage industry, many of our kids are addicted to ultra-processed foods and we have the highest rate of obesity and diabetes of any major country on Earth.We used to have the most advanced transportation system in the world. Not any more. Our public transportation and rail systems lag far behind most other developed countries and millions of people spend hours a day in traffic jams.But the decline we are seeing in our country is not just in economics. Our political system is corrupt, dominated by an extremely greedy billionaire class that is able to buy and sell politicians.Even more troubling, our country is rapidly descending into authoritarianism under an unstable, narcissistic leader who wants more and more power for himself.Donald Trump is usurping the powers of Congress, attacking the courts, intimidating the media, threatening universities, and prosecuting and arresting his political opponents.We are living through one of the most difficult moments in the history of our countryAnd then, on top of all that, there is Trump’s domestic army, ICE, an agency which, every day, is acting in outrageous and unconstitutional ways.ICE is occupying and terrorizing communities, kicking down doors without due process, sending five-year-old children to detention centers, illegally deporting people and shooting down American citizens in cold blood.Further, Trump’s authoritarianism extends far beyond our own borders.Today, we have a president who feels far more comfortable with the dictatorships of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE than with the democratic nations in Europe, a president who, along with Elon Musk and others, is supporting rightwing extremist parties throughout the world.We have a president who has given unconditional support to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, a war criminal who is under indictment by the international criminal court for his genocidal policies.We have a president who violates international law with impunity by illegally attacking Venezuela, absurdly suggesting that Canada become our 51st state and, insanely, threatening to seize Greenland from Denmark.So where do we go from here? How do we reverse America’s decline? How do we create an economy that works for working people and not just billionaires, a vibrant democracy and a foreign policy based on international law?The answer is not complicated. We do it by building a national grassroots movement that fights for the needs of the American working class. We do it by bringing people together – Black, white, Latino, Asian, gay and straight – around an agenda that takes on the greed of the oligarchs and is based on the foundation of economic, social, racial and environmental justice.Is this an impossible dream? Can it be done? You bet it can.Zohran Mamdani’s successful grassroots campaign in New York City has given us the roadmap.Starting at just 1% in the polls, Mamdani had the guts to take on the Democratic establishment, the Republican establishment and the oligarchs. And he won by organizing a grassroots campaign of more than 90,000 volunteers knocking on doors behind a strong progressive agenda.Yes. What Mamdani accomplished in New York City can and should be replicated in all 50 states.The lesson of Mamdani’s campaign is clear: it is not good enough just to be critical of Trump and his destructive policies. We must bring forth a positive vision that will improve the lives of ordinary Americans.Here are just a few of the issues that must be addressed:We must create a vibrant democracy by ending Citizens United and preventing billionaires from buying elections.Whether the Democratic establishment likes it or not, we must guarantee healthcare as a human right through Medicare for All.We must build millions of affordable homes and apartments and give our younger generation the opportunity to own a home of their own.We must make public colleges, universities, trade schools and medical schools tuition-free and have the best childcare and public school system in the entire world.We must expand social security and bring back traditional pension plans so that every senior in this country can retire with dignity.We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage and guarantee every worker the right to join a union.We must demand that the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations in America pay their fair share in taxes.We are living through one of the most difficult moments in the history of our country. But the truth is that, throughout our nation’s history, we have faced great challenges before. From the revolutionary war to the abomination of slavery, from the Great Depression to the second world war, and from the century-long struggle for civil rights to the struggles for women’s rights, workers’ rights and LGBTQ+ rights, the people of our nation fought for justice – and prevailed. And we can do it again.In times of great crisis, the American people came together and chose democracy over authoritarianism, justice over greed, solidarity over division. They understood in the past – and we understand today – that when we stand together, no matter how much money and power the oligarchs have, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish.That is how we reverse America’s decline, renew our democracy, and build a future worthy of our children and generations yet to come.Bernie Sanders is a US senator, and ranking member of the health, education, labor and pensions committee.

When he runs the country, he says, he will cut child benefit for those with more than two children and switch the £3bn saved tokeep down the price of beer.The art of populism lies in headlines. It is about the way you tell it. Farage also says he would still give benefits to “British working families”, meaning about 3,700 households with two British-born parents who both work full-time. It seems a gratuitous discrimination. As for cutting VAT on pubs to 10%, it would apply not just to pubs but to the entire hospitality sector. It was for effect that he decided to make the announcement in a pub rather than McDonald’s.The truth is that no national tax is hypothecated, other than the BBC licence fee. Farage’s family benefits would be as likely to go to bombers as to beer. He just wished to show some glimmer of fiscal responsibility. But his choice of pubs for special mention is significant. The government’s handling ofBritain’s high streetsis causing devastation.Higher taxes on jobs and higher minimum wages, an end to rates relief and soaring energy bills have crippled small retail businesses. The assault on casual labour in theEmployment Rights Actis another impending black hole. On top of this is the previous government’s easing of change-of-use from pubs to housing. Hence a perfect storm for the old Bull and Bush. Britain haslost a quarterof its pubs since 2000 and they areclosing at a rateof one a day in England and Wales. It is a real tragedy.The role of the pub as a local hub, whether in town or country, is hard to exaggerate. It is unlike an ordinary shop or cafe. It is usually the most historic and well-known local building after the church. A pub’s walls can be a local museum. The bar is open to all adults, rich and poor, friend and foe, gregarious and lonely. It is somewhere they can meet, watch television or merely pass the time of day. For many old people it serves as a day centre. None of these uses appear on planning documents.The pub’s proprietor is often a well-known local character, his or her building a place of security and even refuge. Since Covid, pubs have been allowed to spill into the street, where they serve as a centre of neighbourhood activity. At my local pub in central London a bunch of morris dancers once turned up to perform outside. They caused chaos. It was great. A high street without a pub is dead.As such, these places are not just hospitality outlets but unique social institutions. Their future should be discussed in these terms. This is why Rachel Reeves’sattack on pubs– despite herminor U-turn– is an act of social debilitation. Farage was right to focus attention on them.The nearest parallel to the pub is the one-time status of the parish church. It too was a place of local resort and comfort. Its leadership signified communal continuity and cohesion. That is now rarely the case. Some churches still offer support to those in need of company. But they operate on the fringes of communities, compared with pubs. Since their buildings mostly cannot be demolished, it would at least be good if, sometime in the future, the pub and the church could marry. The church pub should become the architecture of a united community.The prime minister this week announced an£800m extensionto his £5bn Pride in Place scheme. This was allegedly aimed at boosting an ever-increasing number of “communities”, selected by Whitehall as locations in which Reform is alarmingly strong. Note how to get cash out of today’s Treasury. The communities secretary, Steve Reed, suggested local boards would have powers and cash compulsorily to purchase properties left empty too long in the hands of property companies. We await the first one.U-turn on pubs has not solved the government’s mess on business rates | Nils PratleyRead moreOne proposal is to turn ailing retail and hospitality sites intonot-for-profit social enterprises. This is one expanding sector of high-street activity, with some130,000 social enterprisesreportedly already up and running across Britain. The village shop in the Archers’ Ambridge is now such a business, as is the famousPlough pubin Fadmoor on the North York Moors. Every village should have a social enterprise, but it requires an active community to operate it, not just one feared by Labour as pro-Reform.When Starmer came to power he pledged, as does every incoming prime minister, to devolve power by giving it back to communities across the UK. They would have “a right torequest more powers”. Like every prime minister, he then did the opposite. He stripped local communities of virtually their last true area of discretion, over local housing and planning. It was an act of ultimate centralism.If Starmer now means to U-turn on this, so well and good. He might help by relieving high streets of the looming bureaucracy of his new employment act. He either means what he says or he is just descending to Farage’s level. The communities in which both are taking an interest are having the blood drained from their veins.The blood is that of local institutions that bring people together, that serve other purposes than those of money. One of them is the pub.

The animal kingdom could give us some cluesElle HuntAs fewer people choose to pair up, let alone marry, it could be that our species’ mating patterns are moving closer to the natural orderThu 5 Feb 2026 10.29 ESTLast modified on Thu 5 Feb 2026 13.31 ESTShareMonogamy, you may have heard, is in crisis.Fewer people are in relationships, let alone opting to be in one’til death. And even those who have already exchanged vows seem to be increasingly looking for wiggle room. “Quiet divorce” – mentally checking out of your union, rather than going through the rigmarole of formally dissolving it – isreportedly on the rise, as is “ethical non-monogamy” (ENM) and opening up a relationship to include other partners.This is borne out by my experience on mainstream dating apps. About one profile in every 10 I come across seems to express a preference for “ENM” or polyamory, or mentions an existing wife or girlfriend. The best you can hope for, if you’re prepared to accept those terms, is that the “primary partner” really is across the arrangement as described.From Lily Allen’sheadline-grabbing albumspilling the gory details of how her glitzy marriage came undone, to Haim’s Relationships, a song that expresses fretful ambivalence about the mere concept of monogamy itself, pop culture narratives seem to be just as cynical about our capacity to commit to one person. No wonder it is hard to feel optimistic about monogamy.A survey in May last yearof 1,000 Britons found that nearly a third (31%) believed monogamy was no longer a “realistic” ideal; among 18- to 24-year-olds, that rose to 42%. A larger pollin 2023 by YouGovfound respondents were nearly exactly split on whether humans were “naturally monogamous” or not (with nearly a third not being sure).For conservatives, of course, all this is deeply troubling, and evidence of the erosion of good Christian values and the traditional family unit. But what if this uneasy reckoning with monogamy is not society acting out against the natural order, but moving us closer in line with it?Late last year,a studyfrom the University of Cambridge shed light on how humans’ tendency towards monogamous pairings compared to that of other mammals. This “monogamy league table”, ranking the proportion of half and full-siblings in 35 species, put us comfortably in the top 10 – but not at No 1.In fact humans ranked below African wild dogs, moustached tamarins and Eurasian beavers, and with a “monogamy rate” just above that of white-handed gibbons and meerkats. Placed bottom of the species studied was the Scottish Soay sheep, reflecting each ewe’s mating with several rams; at the top was the California deermouse, which, once mated, stays paired for life.So what does this tell us? That we should be looking to beavers for secrets to a happy, lasting marriage? That traditionalists should take up the California deermouse as a mascot for monogamy (it is admittedly quite cute)? Or that efforts to loosen the marital tie, “ethically” or otherwise, are at odds with our species’ essential nature?Though the study establishes monogamy as “the dominant mating pattern for our species”, its takeaways for us are of course limited,as acknowledged by its authorDr Mark Dyble, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of Cambridge. It measures reproductive monogamy, that is, whether an animal procreates with multiple partners, because “in most mammals, mating and reproduction are tightly linked”. But humans haven’t been so bound for a long time, especially since the development of birth control.Unlike other animals, complex cultural norms have always influenced our approach to sexual and romantic pairings. Marriage itself – a relatively recent institution in our species’ 300,000-year-long history, thought to beroughly 4,300 years old– served to bind women to men (for a long time as property), ensure paternity and protect the male line.Christianity began to become involved from the eighth century, and then the state added more layers of baggage, regulating interpersonal unions in order to govern property and inheritance.Monogamy (reproductive or otherwise) has never been guaranteed through any of these permutations of pair-bonding. It certainly hasn’t always been uniformly expected: women have historically faced greater social and personal repercussionsfor infidelitythan men.And to focus only on the western approach to pairing and reproduction actually elides huge diversity among humans. Only a minority of societies globally (a reported 17%) are strictly monogamous, according to a 2013 study. As a species we have come up with a range of potential approaches to partnership, “from serial monogamy to stable polygamy”, as Dyble notes in the Cambridge study, and within all of them created conditions for committed parenting.This is all the more remarkable in comparison with our primate relatives. Mountain gorillas and chimpanzees rank very low in the “monogamy league table”, instead living in non-monogamous groups. Yet our own preference for monogamy is likely to have developed on from that arrangement.Viewed in this context, the recent second-guessing of monogamy seems less like an affront to our nature, or a threat to our societies, and more like another step in our evolution. Not only has it always tolerated different kinds of pairings; it has always been in flux, negotiated not just between individuals but in line with our society and times. Indeed, given the tremendous baggage we’ve wrapped up with our “mating system”, it’s somewhat remarkable that it’s proved so load-bearing yet so flexible.We may be nothing but mammals, but the Cambridge study is a timely reminder of the diversity not just between species but within them. The state or health of monogamy can’t be assessed separate from the effects of politics, religion, culture, economics and – lately, increasingly – technology.As such, it will continue to evolve. Perhaps it’s no wonder the California deermouse manages to mate for life: its average life expectancy in the wild is less than two years.Elle Hunt is a freelance journalistExplore more on these topicsEvolutionOpinionAnimalsMarriageBiologyFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Start thinking like a developing countryLarry ElliottSince the 70s, China has turned around its economy – from introducing subsidies to mining untapped talent, these are the lessons Starmer must take note ofThu 5 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 5 Feb 2026 13.33 ESTShareMargaret Thatcher and Deng Xiaoping were both on a mission when they came to power within months of each other at the tail end of the 1970s. Thatcher wanted to reinvigorate capitalism in Britain, while Deng launched a programme of reform and liberalisation that he calledsocialism with Chinese characteristics.Since then, the economies of Britain andChinahave been transformed, but in different ways. China was essentially a peasant economy when Deng took control, but it has since become an industrial powerhouse, while Britain has ceased to be a major manufacturing player and instead became a country dominated by services.As Keir Starmer may have noticed on hisvisit to Chinalast week, somewhere along the way the two countries have swapped places. In the early days of Deng’s reforms, there was a concentration on mass-produced goods where China’s much lower labour costs gave it a competitive edge. That is no longer the case, with China the dominantproducer of electric vehiclesand vying with the US in artificial intelligence.To be sure, there are many good things about Britain, just as there are many bad things about China. Yet if the comparison between China’s manufacturing prowess and the service-sector dominated British economy makes Starmer uncomfortable, then so it should. China is what a country that still cares about making stuff looks like.The prime minister’s trip to China has quickly been overshadowed by the latest revelations about Peter Mandelson, yet there are threeimportant lessonsfrom the visit. The first is that manufacturing matters. Britain will not prosper again without rebuilding its productive base. The alternative to a strong and thriving manufacturing sector is not an economy dominated by highly paid “knowledge workers”, but a low-tech service sector in which finance dominates.Services now account for about80% of the British economy, 10 times the size of manufacturing. Yet it is much harder to improve the efficiency of a labour-intensive service-sector job than it is a job in a factory. Britain’s weak productivity performance since the financial crisis of 2008 should not really come as that much of a surprise.The essence of Thatcherism was that market forces should determine which businesses thrived. If Britain excelled in financial and business services, then so be it. That’s what the country should concentrate its efforts on, while other nations made the ships and the machine tools. Yet services are not separate from the productive side of the economy; rather they depend on machinery, transport systems, data infrastructure and energy systems. If a country doesn’t manufacture these things, then it has to import them, which is precisely what Britain does. Exports of services do not compensate for atrade deficit in goodsthat has persisted since the early 1980s. What’s more, the dangers of an over-reliance on imported manufactured goods were brutally exposed during the pandemic of 2020 as global supply chains froze up.The second lesson is that, despite the dismal record of the past 50 years, it is not too late to rebuild Britain’s industrial base. This is a rich country with abundant reserves of untapped talent. Denmark’s successfulwind-turbine sectorshows that small, rich western countries can still enjoy industrial success. It is over-pessimistic to assume that the manufacturing ship has sailed and that the best Britain can do is rely on the City and the few remaining pockets of industry, such as pharmaceuticals.The final lesson from Starmer’s visit to China is that rejuvenating the manufacturing sector will require a colossal effort. Clearly, Britain is never going to be the workshop of the world again – as it was in the 19th century – but even the more modest target of raising manufacturing’s share of the economy from 8% to 10% of gross domestic product would be no mean feat. Industrial strategies designed with that in mind have come and gone with depressing regularity.The Guardian view on high-street decline: a symbol of failure in a discontented nation | EditorialRead moreCharting a course and sticking to it for longer than a couple of years matters. A dedicated economic ministry with the power to face down the bean counters in the Treasury would help greatly, because investment – public and private – will be vital. Any industrial strategy will struggle unless the right foundations are put in place, so it is hard to see how manufacturing can be rebuilt without a thriving domestic steel sector.Problems are immediately apparent. Even if the UK puts serious effort into building industrial capacity, won’t the new factories face being strangled at birth by already well-established overseas competitors? How, for example, could a UK company making electric vehicles prevent itself being undercut by cheaper Chinese models?The answer is that there is no way of preventing such an outcome without active steps being taken by the government. This could involve stipulating a domestic component for goods sold in Britain. It could involve a “buy British” procurement policy. It could mean subsidies and tax credits for UK manufacturing plants of the sortJoe Biden introducedin the US. There is a whole range of measures – from tax to tariffs – that developing countries regularly use to protect their infant industries as they find their feet.Despite becoming the world’s second biggest economy, China still picks winners and has strict controls on capital. If Britain is ever to emerge from its post-industrial decline, the same approach would not go amiss. The bottom line is that to rebuild manufacturing Britain has to see the world through the prism of a developing country not a developed one.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsManufacturing sectorOpinionServices sectorEconomic policyChinacommentShareReuse this content"

This was a surprise for two reasons: I’m chronically online so I usually see everything first, and also there are no good news stories any more in this life. But it was real, and for many people, including me, this one piece of blessed news was equal to three or four regular pieces of good news.It is a rat king of good news, a fatberg of good news clogging up my pipes. It had beenannounced that*trumpets heralding**doves released*the iconic Nigella Lawson is joining the iconic The Great British Bake Off!!!!!! (I don’t know how many exclamation marks are allowed in the Guardian style guide, I might be pushing it.)Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsMy reaction might seem over the top, but I won’t allow you to Debbie Downer this news that has turned my frown upside down. One of my favourite people on the planet to watch on TV, joining a TV show I love and watch every season of. As a TV lover, nothing could be better. Bake Off is a wonderful, cosy, sweet, fun and delicious show. Unlike other reality competition shows (which I also love), the contestants on the showarethere to make friends. I’ve enjoyed Prue Leith’s reign on the show, she is an experienced and polite woman, but I am filled with delighted anticipation about what the new season will look like with the addition of the eponymous Nigella.Changes to judging lineups are inevitable in long-running reality shows, and the shift in dynamic can sometimes cause issues, but in this case I feel as chill as puff pastry between laminations. The show has already been through several host and judge shake-ups over the last few years, and the previous change was one of the best, replacing Matt Lucas (I used to shut one eye and try to pretend he wasn’t there) with the delightful Alison Hammond. Alison is a hilarious presence who also says “bake” like “BIYKE”, forcing you to repeat it in your own home every time. I respect Prue, but I can’t wait to see how Alison and Nigella vibe. I think, like Alison, Nigella will be an extremely warm presence, which will work well with Paul Hollywood’s statue-like husky-eyed, semi-evil demeanour. I suspect we may see a slight rise in double entendres, but if anyone disrespects Nigella, they will be facing the wrath of a global audience. Just because we like watching sweet baking shows doesn’t mean we can’t get revenge.Vertigo has turned my world upside down. But knowing there are famous people suffering steadies me | Rebecca ShawRead moreI was curious about whether Nigella would bring the cosy and intimate vibe she is most known for, or if she would switch it up for the show and become a stringent judge. Then Iread thisinterview:“I’m not someone who looks for fault, I look for pleasure,” she said, positioning herself as the counterbalance to Hollywood’s famously technical lens. “I’m all about the eating,”she added.Thank God. Actually, this is the only area I can see Nigella causing an issue. The tent they bake in is not temperature controlled, which can cause big issues with baking and also with English people, who aren’t able to cope above 25C. Everyone is already sweaty and stressed, and thenNigella Lawsonappears? To judge you? I’d be afraid of becoming incapacitated. I know there are already a lot of shows to watch Nigella do her thing, but I’m most looking forward to watching her interact with the contestants.Bake Off is quite often a really diverse show, especially compared with scripted television. It’s hard to predict who will be more obsessed with her – the queer women? The gay men? The underappreciated mothers? The straight lads with a heart of gold? The straight dads with a heart of gold? Nigella is funny, charming, warm, smart and beautiful. She is relaxed with all sorts of people, seems down to earth, and her dynamic with each of the unique individuals on the show will be a really fun part of the viewing experience.The decision to hire her makes complete sense. She has the skills, the temperament, the fans. In my mind, she should already be spending her life where random people just prepare delicious things for her to have bites of. If she was carried around the tent on a palanquin by big strong men and fed peeled grapes as a palate cleanser between each tasting, that would also feel completely right to me. It’s got all the ingredients for a perfectly baked show.It might not seem like much, but more and more we have to celebrate the small wins, the nice things, the things we can look forward to. In these grim and bleak times, I can picture a future of Nigella eating things with a little fork in the Bake Off tent, and that’s enough to keep me going.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsThe Great British Bake OffOpinionNigella LawsonFood TVTelevisionReality TVcommentShareReuse this content"

You may well have lamented this, too, especially if you’ve ever been cornered by an enthusiast at a party. India pale ale (IPA), for example, which was once a distinctly British style of ale designed for export, has, in the hands of American craft brewers, become a sort of standard-bearer forcomplicatedbeer: aggressively hopped, often startlingly bitter and/or sour, and redolent of a bygone era of millennial hipster striving.The very term “craft beer” itself is confusing enough. It was originally used bythe Colorado-based Brewers Associationto denote “small, independent and traditional” breweries, but many of the movement’s trailblazers (Goose IslandandBrooklynto name just two) have since been snapped up by multinationals, while theactualAmerican craft sectordeclined last yeareven as IPA tightened its grip.Still, every trend has its counter-trend and, in retrospect, the moment whenBeavertown Neck Oilbecame available on draught at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium may well have been a turning point. And the unashamedly mass-produced Guinness is famously the order of choice for gen Z. Meanwhile, I’ve noticed a definite uptick in “Erm ... lager?” when ordering rounds with my friends (often accompanied by complaints about the dire effects of IPAs on the middle-aged stomach).There’s also a subset of British brewers who are pushing to make beer, well, beer again. “You can now see these American-style IPAs in every pub around the country,” says Adrian Peskin ofWoodshedding Breweryin Shepton Mallet, Somerset. “So, the craftiest thing you can do now is to turn 180 and go back to where it was before.” Peskin, who is of dual English-German heritage, typifies this new generation. He runs a genuinely small operation out of an old milk barn where he concentrates on “simple beers from complex soil”– old-world styles that have either been neglected or forgotten. Among his beers isStubn, a rich, ruby alt beer, a style popular in Düsseldorf before Bavarian-style lager came to dominate; he also champions the slept-on British beer styles made “since for ever” by medium-sized regional breweries such asTimothy Taylor’sin West Yorkshire andHarvey’sin East Sussex.Peskin reckons it’s also about appreciating beer’s role in society: “The craft beer movement really shifted the focus on to the beer itself,” he says, “whereas, traditionally, beer was more like a conduit for other stuff – good chat, gathering people together. It was never meant to be as divisive as it’s become.” Amen to that!Four old world classicsEcks Victorian Mild Ale£28.80 (6 x 440ml cans) woodsheddingbrew.com, 5.7%.

Mandelson “portrayed Jeffrey Epstein as someone he barely knew” and was sacked as soon as it became clear the relationship had beenmuch closer.Addressing the scale of the deception on Thursday, the prime minister sounded authentically outraged. Mandelson had failed a “basic test of honesty” and “such deceit is incompatible with public service”. Credulity is not a great defence. Focusing on the lies obscures the extent of what was already known to be true when the fateful appointment was made.It was not a secret that Mandelson had some kind of friendship with Epstein. Evidence of it was in the public domain. The necessary question that followed was what level of intimacy with a man who had trafficked underage girls for sex might be tolerable in a potential ambassador. The only good answer was zero.Downing Street failed to apply that test. One explanation is that Mandelson was deemed to possess unique qualities that made himsuitable as an emissaryto the court of Donald Trump. The cupidity that brought him into Epstein’s orbit in the first place, his social facility in that sleaziest of milieux, may even have been a perverse recommendation, given the character of the US president.The risk of some scandal erupting – high in any event, given Mandelson’s record of ignominious resignations dating back decades – was deemed worth taking for the perceived benefit of influence in the White House.If that was indeed the reasoning, it speaks to more than just a malfunction of political antennae. To weigh the downside of association with a convicted sex offender against an upside in diplomatic access is a calculation that would not even have occurred to people who kept care and respect forEpstein’s victimsuppermost in their minds.Sir Keir has apologised to those victims, but his regret is expressed in self-exculpatory terms – contrition for having been deceived into allowing Mandelson’s appointment. There is a strain of self-pity in that formulation, as if the salient offence that needs addressing is a fraud perpetrated against the prime minister and he, too, is a victim. The more profound apology owed by theLabourleader to women and girls exploited by Epstein is for not having given them enough thought before the scandal started to threaten his position.It is feasible that Sir Keir did not interrogate the ethics of choices being made in his name regarding the ambassadorial appointment because he had outsourced much of his political judgment to Morgan McSweeney, his chief of staff and a protege of Mandelson.Many Labour MPs suspect that Mr McSweeney has had toostrong an influencein Downing Street for too long. His position already looked vulnerable given the party’s dismal polling andlikely maulingin May’s local and devolved elections. It looks increasingly untenable given the Mandelson association. But criticism of an adviser is usually a proxy for dissatisfaction with the leader. Overreliance on bad advice is another symptom of deficient judgment. Unless there is some drastic change in the political weather, the tide of Labour frustration with poor decisions made in No 10 can only rise, sooner or later sweeping Sir Keir from office.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Their de facto leaders – the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and Abu Dhabi’s then crown prince, Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, now president of the UAE – hadforged a close alliance. The older man had eagerly promoted the younger Saudi royal in Washington and elsewhere, and was seen as his mentor. Riyadh borrowed aspects of the UAE’s model, and the countries together intervened – at huge cost – against Houthi rebels in Yemen. Together they sought to contain the Arab spring and backed authoritarian rule in Egypt, Bahrain and elsewhere.Yet by 2023the relationship had soured: the Saudi crown prince reportedly accused the UAE of“stabb[ing] us in the back”. Late last year the disputes became spectacularly public. In Yemen, Southern secessionists backed by the UAE made dramatic advances in oil-rich areas – before being forced out by Saudi-backed forces. Riyadh effectively described the UAE asthreatening its national security. Saudi commentators voiced increasing contempt for the kingdom’s former partner. In turn, a senior Emirati officialcomplained of “wickedness”in the media campaign against it.Profound strategic differencesand economic and political rivalry have severed the partnership. Saudi Arabia is focused on internal transformation and wants a stable region, conducive to investment. Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine ended Riyadh’s isolation by the west for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, broadening its diplomatic options.The UAE has been far more activist in its foreign policy, convinced that fundamental changes – particularly in containing Islamist parties – are needed for long-term stability. It has also, increasingly, aligned itself with Israel. It has chafed at Saudi pressure to limit Opec production – and at companies decamping next door after Riyadh said government contracts were limited to those with regional headquarters inSaudi Arabia. There is competition for US favour; both countries have growing financial ties with the Trump family. Saudi Arabia seeks a mutual defence pact with Turkey and Pakistan; the UAE wants one with India.No one expects this rupture to lead to the sort of full-blown confrontation seen with Qatar. Some analysts already detect a desire for de-escalation. Yet the impact is still likely to be profound.Proxy politics are the norm for Gulf powers. But the UAE has appeared especially enthusiastic. It supported the warlord Khalifa Haftar in Libya to devastating effect, and despite its denials there is increasing evidence of itsbacking for the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in Sudan’s brutal war. Some fear that it may escalate support for the RSF, with its record of atrocities, deepening Sudan’s fragmentation. There are concerns too about its role in Syria. Last month, Somalia accused the UAE of “hostile and destabilising actions” thanks to its growing ties with breakaway Somaliland.Even if this rift can be contained, Saudi and Emirati interests are diverging. While their partnership alarmed many, the risk is that peace and reconstruction may becomeeven harder to achievein the Middle East and the Horn of Africa. Without a cohesive regional strategy, the already fraught prospects for Palestinian statehood look even frailer. Gulf states are not the only ones who shouldfear the repercussionsof this split.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As a church minister who has been involved in dealing with a small number of historical allegations of abuse, may I make the following observations. The Methodist church has a robust safeguarding policy, with mandatory training for everyone who works or volunteers in the church, and there is much work being done to help us hear the voices of those abused.Despite all this, when an allegation of historical abuse is made, congregations find it almost impossible to believe that the elderly man they have known, loved and respected for decades could be guilty of such a crime. The accuser is often younger, female and had left the church decades before, so is a stranger. I have also observed families of the accused, especially wives, absolutely deny that their loved one could be capable of such things, despite evidence, court cases and convictions.In conversations with professionals who have far more experience than I, my observations have been accepted as common in many safeguarding cases. If ordinary church folk – intelligent people, many of whom work or have worked in the caring professions – find it so hard to comprehend and accept the evidence, why are we surprised that wealthy, powerful men have ignored the evidence against Epstein?It is not enough to say we must hear the voices of the abused – we must also listen, and believe their words, when our gut reaction is to deny the allegations against people we know. That is a very hard thing to do and needs intention.Rev Glayne WorganSale, CheshireMarina Hyde’s last sentence, about women and girls learning that Epstein’s helpers didn’t care about the exploitation, is key. Epstein’s survivors, and others like me who were sexually assaulted and trafficked as children, will always carry the pain of recognising that so many others knew about the crimes but said nothing. We didn’t matter. Child exploitation is just sex in many adult men’s eyes.For me, there is a silver lining in now being clear-eyed about how society views the sexual abuse of children. I can let go of any guilt that I carry about not having tried hard enough to stop the assaults. Had I spoken out, it would have been hard to find someone brave enough to listen, justice would not have been pursued, and I would have endangered myself further.Name and address suppliedThanks to Marina Hyde for cutting through the noise engulfing the fallout from the latestJeffrey Epsteinfiles release. It’s been sickening to hear these grotesque revelations. But almost as sickening is the immediate rush in some quarters to use this violation and exploitation of young women and girls as a convenient springboard for an attack on certain political or constitutional bogeymen.For some, it appears more important to see this horror show as a means to call for the abolition of the royal family, or to attack a particular tribe in theLabourparty, or even to pontificate about some other political cause de jour. Some newspaper comment threads were a disgrace; the victims were reduced to mere proxies for righteous rage about this, that or the other – in effect, dehumanised all over again.Surely we’re better than this? For the sake of Epstein’s victims, I bloody well hope so.Colin MontgomeryEdinburghHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

He is studying biochemistry and is in the final year of a four-year course. He is job-seeking. In that endeavour, he has had the misfortune to have been born to professional parents.His mother (me) is a solicitor and his father an accountant. He went to a selective state grammar school – the very type of school designed to create social mobility. He lives in a “good” postcode and never had free school meals. As a result, his job opportunities seem to be limited. The eligibility requirements of many job advertisements in biosciences exclude him because of his selective school. For some applications, he must give his parents’ postcode, their job titles and level of education. It seems designed to exclude him from the first sift.The injustice is that both of us (his parents) strived hard from working-class backgrounds. We started from nothing and used vigour, drive and determination, together with a strong work ethic, to gain the returns we have made. Our son is instilled with the same ethics and drive, but he will be excluded from the same chances, because of our efforts.Bring on “class” as a protected characteristic. The only problem will be defining what that is. We might be professionals, but we are definitely working class – and so is our son.Name and address suppliedThe problem of declining representation of the working class at top levels extends far beyond the arts (Report sets out ‘blueprint for change’ to increase working-class representation in the arts, 26 January). It is no coincidence that the decline is contemporary, with the introduction of comprehensive education in the 1970s.In the early 1960s, I attended a leading independent school, where about half the pupils were fully funded by the county council. I then attended an Oxford college where a majority of students came from state grammar schools, mostly in the north of England. These students went on to play leading roles in society. Such opportunities no longer exist.A well-intended reform to improve opportunity for all seems to have had the opposite effect. To have any chance of lasting success, the “class ceiling” movement will have to bite the bullet and undertake a radical review of secondary education in the UK.David BellHarrow, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But violence is part and parcel of how prisons function.Hundreds of people die in prison each year, the majority by suicide, medical neglect or drugs. Even if we focus on homicides, they reveal how violence operates at an institutional level. Last year, the inquest ofSundeep Ghumanexposed how it was multiple failures by the prison, not just the actions of his cellmate, that led to his unlawful killing. The jury concluded that by forcing Sundeep to share a cell with a known racist, the prison contributed to his death. The inquest also found that placing three men in a nine-square-metrecell designed for two increased tensions.Deaths like Sundeep’s reinforce how prisons should be seen as perpetrators of harm and death. They subject people to restraint and tasers, daily 23-hour lockups in cells, indefinite segregation and the denial of basic necessities including food, medicine and even underwear.Further, the article is wrong to frame prison homicides as a new crisis. Since records began in 1978, there has been no year-on-year increase, with homicides oscillating between zero and eight annually. South asserts that “violence is not inevitable”, but Inquest’s casework exposes how prisons inherently enforce violence, degradation and dehumanisation on those trapped inside.There are no “good prisons” and there never will be. Research has long proven that prisons do not rehabilitate or deter crime. Rather, they exacerbate existing societal issues. To end the cycle of violence, the government must cease prison building, reduce the prison population and invest in community-based services to prevent contact with the criminal justice system in the first place.Jessica PandianSenior policy and communications officer, InquestExplore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceCrimelettersShareReuse this content"

Which makes the prediction of Eve Muirhead, Britain’s chef de mission at the Milano Cortina Games, rather extraordinary.“I believe that we are taking one of the most potent teams of athletes that we have taken to a Winter Olympic Games,” she says. “We have the capability to disrupt the norm.”‘Penis injection’ claims in Winter Olympics ski jumping investigated by WadaRead moreThat norm, between 1952 and 2010, was just 12 medals in 16 Winter Games. Then came a surge, withfive medals in Sochi in 2014and five inPyeongchang in 2018, beforeBritain won just two medals in Beijing. But Muirhead, who led thewomen’s curling team to Team GB’s only goldfour years ago, senses that new ground will be broken by the 53 British athletes over the next 16 days.“I see a set of athletes with a real pedigree in terms of recent results in the winter circuit,” she says. “And while we are a nation that already punches well above our weight, given the relative lack of snow and ice, I believe this team has the potential to really disrupt the natural order of big winter nations.”UK Sport, which has invested £25.5m across winter sports for the 2022-26 cycle, has set a goal of four to eight medals. But it is clear that Muirhead wants to be right at the top end of that target.“As a nation we are still an emerging challenger in many winter sports and part of our ambition at the Games is to show we are a credible team across all disciplines,” she adds. “And I firmly believe we will be.”There is certainly significant evidence behind her optimism. In the weeks before the Games, GB Snowsports’Mia Brookes, Kirsty Muir andZoe Atkinall won X Games titles, while Charlotte Bankes won her first World Cup race since breaking her collar bone.View image in fullscreenNow chef de mission for Team GB, Eve Muirhead is hoping several of Britain’s competitors can emulate her gold medal at the 2022 Winter Olympics.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAIn the men’s skeleton,Matt Weston and Marcus Wyatthave won all seven World Cup races this season and, according to the bookies, the men’s and mixed curling teams are also favourites to win a medal.It helps that additional resources have also been pumped into technological innovations. At the University of Bath a flight simulator has been converted to simulate any skeleton track across the world, allowing the team to get hours of extra practice on the run they will encounter in Cortina.Weston and Wyatt are also waiting to see whether they will be able to usetheir new aerodynamic helmets, which could give them an even bigger advantage. “We try to push the boundaries and find those gains, this is just one of the parts of innovation we do as GB and I think we do it pretty well,” says Weston.Wyatt, meanwhile, is hopeful the helmet will be cleared. “We believe it is legal, it’s currently being debated. All of our success has been with our current helmet, so for me it is the tiniest little thing in the background.”Meanwhile, in sports where speed is the major factor, special tech skinsuits have been introduced to reduce drag in competition, allowing athletes to go faster.The great unknown, of course, is what other nations have planned. “We know that in some of those sports, particularly the sliding sports, the Germans run an R&I programme which is worth millions,” says UK Sport’s head of performance, Kate Baker. “They could pull something out on the day.“I think if you spend any time hanging around any of our sports, not just the winter sports, you will see that they are all constantly looking at what everybody else is doing. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that it’s an arms race. It is definitely an expertise race, though.“Where other nations have a sliding track, or a ski slope on their doorstep, they are able to do the kind of behind-closed-doors stuff that we can do more easily in cycling than we can in winter sports.”But for all the emphasis on tech and talent, those competing know their chances could come down to a lucky break or how they handle the pressure.“None of us really want to make the Olympics a big thing, but it is in reality and there’s no hiding that,” says Brookes, the 19-year-old who could end up winning two medals and being Britain’s biggest star at these Games.“I’ve been scared that I’ll go to the Olympics, do the best I can, and it not be enough. You know the whole world’s going to be watching, and that definitely adds more pressure.”Muirhead agrees. “A lot of these athletes have 20-30 seconds of competition. Then there’s the jeopardy of winter sports. A wrong edge, that could be it over. It comes down to millimetres, milliseconds. But let’s just kind of hope we’re on the right side of the inch.”Team GB will hope to get off to a strong start on Monday with Muir and Brookes going for gold in the ski slopestyle and snowboard big air respectively, while the mixed curling team will aim to be competing in the semi-finals.Whatever happens, Muirhead expects the nation to quickly renew its once-every-four-year fling with winter sports. “What does the Winter Olympics not have?” she asks. “You’ve got speed, flair and I guess a bit of chaos thrown in as well. And that’s what people love to watch on TV.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBnewsShareReuse this content"

The Premier League champions did move for the Netherlands international Geertruida, who is on loan at Sunderland from Leipzig and wanted the transfer, but the deal was called off because Sunderland were unable to secure a replacement.England’s late 2026 World Cup start gives FA headache over warm-up matchesRead moreSlot is without two defenders for the remainder of the season in Conor Bradley and Giovanni Leoni, and Jeremie Frimpong is sidelined with a hip injury. Joe Gomez has missed the past two games with a hip problem but could return to the bench against Manchester City on Sunday.TheLiverpoolhead coach believes his squad will improve but would struggle to withstand further injury setbacks. “I’m very happy with the squad, let that be clear,” Slot said. “But it’s obvious we have three long-term injuries. That’s why we tried to strengthen in the winter break and the player you mentioned, in the end, wasn’t available.“I think there’s more to come from this group of players for obvious reasons. Some reasons I probably blame myself for a bit, but some things I cannot do anything about: injuries, a player not ready to play three games a week. But it’s clear if we have an injury crisis, even more than we already have, then that makes things even more difficult. We have 16 players available and Trey [Nyoni] and Rio [Ngumoha] are two of them.“This squad is able to do better and more than we’ve done until now, in my opinion, but then they all need to stay available. That’s going to be a hell of a challenge because we have three games in seven days coming up.”Liverpool beat Chelsea to the signing of Jacquet, who was also coveted by Bayern Munich, and Slot insisted he agreed with the club’s longer-term transfer strategy. “I always want the best for the club even if in the short term it is not ideal for me,” he said. “I am not saying it is [not ideal] but if it means this, I would always go for the signing that is best for the club. I knew which club I went into. This club has a model of signing talented players younger. I have always liked to work in that way.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

A single person, making it crystal clear where they stand and what for, can be the light in the darkness that helps you navigate today’s turbulent waters.That’s why I’m so grateful forGianni Infantino. The man is the ultimate guide to geopolitics, and a waypost for anyone confused by the moral labyrinth they find themselves living in. Whichever way he’s pointing, you can feel confident you should be headed in the opposite direction.Take Russia’s ongoing exclusion from international events such as Fifa tournaments and the Olympic Games. The efficacy and implementation of sporting bans and boycotts may seem a near-impossible conundrum, to be debated by wiser heads than our own. Then this week you hearFifa’s president say he wants Russia’s ban liftedbecause “it has just created more … hatred”. And you remember that in Decemberhe awarded a peace prizeto a man who immediately seized a Venezuelan president and threatened to invade Greenland andattack Iran.IOC president gives clearest signal so far that Russia could be at 2028 OlympicsRead moreSo it’s helpful to remember the upside down nature of the times we’re living in – as well as the pusillanimous servility of those running some of the planet’s most powerful sporting organisations. Because otherwise it might be quite difficult to resist the plausible arguments to let Russia return to international competition, especially as they begin to be echoed back and forth between football and the Olympics.A day after Infantino’s comments, the International Olympic Committee president, Kirsty Coventry, gave a coded message to the same effect, insisting sport should be a “neutral ground” where athletes “compete freely, without being held back by the politics or divisions of their governments”. As statements go, it registers about as much shock value asLucas Paquetá’s return from West Hamto Brazil.At surface level, you can’t argue with the idea that sportspeople from different countries and cultures should be encouraged to forge relationship across the political barriers that divide them. The world does indeed need to recognise its shared humanity. And this was the same argument for granting Russia the 2014 Sochi Olympics, right beforeVladimir Putin turned it into an opportunityfor systemic state-sponsored doping, crackdowns on LGBT rights, and, oh yes, the annexing of Crimea.Coventry is vocal about the Olympics’ commitment to EDI, so presumably welcoming Russia back is a big tick for her equality, diversity and inclusivity agenda. After all, it’s not anyone’s fault if they’re born in a country with a belligerent authoritarian regime. Unless they’re the child of a United States immigrant, in which case it very much is their fault and they deserve to beseparated from their parents and detained.As for Infantino, he just wants everyone to know that sporting bans don’t work, which is obviously why Russia has been petitioning him so hard to lift theirs. Poor Gianni, he just wants everyone to get along. He still has theOrder of Friendshipthat Putin awarded him in 2019, after Russia had hosted the World Cup the year before. And what kind of a friend would you be if you gave up on someone just because they invaded a neighbouring country?One of the odder things that sport encourages us to do – along with standing in the winter cold en masse, screaming obscenities at people whose shirts are a different colour to ours – is to ask us to take it seriously. We outsource our moral judgment to its quasi-religious sense of neutrality. We believe that because it contains and focuses our most competitive, survivalist and even violent instincts within a 100-yard box, it raises us above our baser instincts and to a higher plane.On the field, everyone stands supposedly equal, even while committing themselves to codes and behaviours formed by European countries when they were still stealing other people’s land for the good of mankind.And as sport has commercialised into a mega-industry, there’s a correlative inflation of its spiritual – or humanist, as you prefer – significance. And that remains even as its own fixation on growth tips the balance of its purpose – from making money to function, to functioning to make money. The Olympics remains one of the greatest shows on Earth; but you can admire theathletes’ efforts in Milanthis month while remembering that even since the nadir ofSalt Lake, bribery and bid-rigginghas continued to dog the organisation that stages it.As for Fifa, one of the world’s most lucrative not-for-profit organisations, its recent history of corruption needs no letter of introduction – although a group of whistleblowers and academics did provide one last year. It argued the organisation iseven more poorly governed than it was a decade ago, when its officials were being arrested for fraud, racketeering and money laundering.In the meantime, they have actively hollowed out their own stated values, be those anti-discrimination, solidarity or human rights. They continue to give World Cups to nations where homosexuality is punishable by death and ban on-field LGBT+ advocacy. As for theexploitation of migrant workersduring the construction of the Qatar World Cup, well, in 2024Fifa rejected the adviceof its own committee to accept its part and help compensate them.The ultimate evidence of the hollowness of Fifa’s values is, of course, the frankly creepy gold bauble that Infantino presented to Donald Trump in lieu of the Nobel that his dear friend wanted. A man standing in front of an ugly naked guy, telling him he’s wearing the finest raiments. Let’s bear this in mind when the same man confidently tells us how playing youth football against Russia can help repair a geopolitical fracture threatening the stability of the entire planet.Sport’s soft power is curdling in the hands of its supposed leaders. Actual leadership requires people prepared to say the things that the powerful, the rich, and the committers of crimes don’t want to hear.This weekPep Guardiola has spoken passionatelyabout the horrors of conflict on innocent people, from Ukraine to Sudan to Palestine. The IOC and Fifa would rather not. You can’t trust politicians to do the right thing, says such silent, neutered morality. But here we can promise you that we will do absolutely nothing at all.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A more radical option would be to move Freddie Steward to the wing and select Marcus Smith, who has been named on the bench, at full-back. Cadan Murley of Harlequins was also named in the squad, but is due to appear for England A against Ireland on Friday night.Six Nations 2026 predictions: our writers on who will win and whyRead moreLosing Feyi-Waboso would be a blow given his form for England and Exeter this season. He started all four of England’s autumn internationals, scoring two tries, and was a constant threat on the wing, reintroducing himself to the international stage after missing last year’s Six Nations with a shoulder injury.For Feyi-Waboso it would be a desperate shame given he is yet to appear for England against Wales, having had the opportunity to choose which of the two nations he would represent. “He’s really keen to be as good as he can be,” said the defence coach Richard Wigglesworth, who confirmed the 23-year-old is a fitness concern. “He’s really coachable, takes feedback really well, wants to learn and he’s got incredible physical commitment as well.”Jamie George, meanwhile, has said that he did not expect to captain England again after he was restored to the role for Saturday’s match with Maro Itoje named on the bench. Itojemissed the start of England’s training campin Girona after travelling to Nigeria to attend his mother’s funeral.As a result Borthwick will start Itoje on the bench, with George leading the side on his own for the first time since his Saracens clubmate was appointed captain last January, before the 2025 championship.“It’s a privilege, I love this job, it’s the best thing in the world, being able to do this,” said George, who co-captained the side with George Ford on last summer’s tour of the Americas. “It’s an incredible opportunity to be doing it again. It’s probably for one week and one week only, so I’m making the most of it. Not a huge amount has changed, the leadership meetings that we have – myself, George, Ellis, Maro – we’re having conversations, I’m speaking to Maro constantly.”England, after 11 straight victories, are red-hot favourites to beat a Wales side who have not won a Six Nations match since 2023. With some bookmakers England are 66-1 on to put Wales to the sword and, while George believes that gives England’s opponents a “free hit”, the 35-year-old hooker has called on his side to embrace the expectation.“While we are looking to use the momentum of the last 12 months we’ve made it very clear that we need to start big and start fast and set the markers down about what this team is going to be moving forward,” he added. “We haven’t shied away from it.“It’s a free swing [for Wales]. When you’re a leader of a team you go looking for what’s going to drive us and I’ve no doubt they’ll be using all the stuff that’s going on in the background, the fact that it’s England v Wales, if I was in their camp I’d probably be saying the same thing.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSix Nations 2026Six NationsRugby unionWales rugby union teamnewsShareReuse this content"

He wants to ensure he’s not the lastMelissa Jacobsin San FranciscoThu 5 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 5 Feb 2026 06.07 ESTShareMidway through the 2023NFLseason, Dallas Cowboys star edge rusher Micah Parsons was frustrated. Asked about the source – a feeling of being held by opponents all the time – Parsons credited his defensive line coach Aden Durde with keeping him in check.“[Coach Durde] pulled me aside and said, ‘You gotta remember, you’re Micah fucking Parsons,” he recalled. “‘This shit is going to happen. You just gotta keep going. Fuck all the other stuff.’”Durde is hardly the first NFL defensive coach to deliver a fiery pep talk, but he is the first to deliver it with an English accent. And come Sunday, Durde will be the first coach from the UK to grace the sidelines of a Super Bowl, when hisSeattle Seahawksface the New England Patriots.Sam Darnold: after five teams and plenty of mockery, ‘Ginger Cuz’ reaches the Super BowlRead moreSeahawks cornerback Devon Witherspoon both respects and gets a kick out of Durde, now in his second season as Seattle’s defensive coordinator.“His accent is pretty dope. I’m intrigued by it. I want to learn to talk like that,” said Witherspoon earlier this week. Witherspoon wasn’t comfortable attempting the accent outside the confines of the Seahawks locker room but excitedly offered a referral.Seahawks safety Coby Bryant lit up at the mere mention of Durde, who hails from north London. After nailing “we’re going to win the Super Bowl” in Durde’s accent, Bryant explained his kinship with his coordinator.“He’s the ultimate competitor,” Bryant said. “People say we’re similar. They think we’re serious and always about work. I respect how he always wants to get better.”To call Seattle’s defense better since Durde and head coach Mike Macdonald came to town two years ago is an understatement. The duo have transformed Seattle’s defense from 30th overall in 2023 to sixth this season. The juggernaut unit allowed a league-best 17.2 points per game, rightfully drawing comparisons to the punishingLegion of Boomof the mid-2010s. Macdonald calls the plays, while Durde works on implementation and individual player development. It’s a partnership that was born the moment they met.“Just listening to him talk about how he sees the game was very similar to how I saw it,” Macdonald said in 2024, “in terms of what you needed to do to be able to defend offenses these days, and he had some really interesting perspective. So we felt like, shoot, we gotta get this guy here in person. Brought him in, [he] did a great job and it just kind of took off from there.”View image in fullscreenUnder Aden Durde and head coach Mike Macdonald, Seattle’s defense has become one of the NFL’s best.Photograph: Lindsey Wasson/APLong before Durde was preparing to coach in the Super Bowl, he was just a kid in Middlesex who liked a different kind of football than most of his neighbors. He grew up a West Ham fan, but American football became his obsession.Well before streaming – and before four games, let alone one, were played in London each season – Durde watched whatever game was on Channel 4. He became a Chicago Bears fan, watching as a six-year-old as they won the 1985 Super Bowl. Childhood heroes such as Richard Dent and Mike Singletary were more than enough to reel him in.“I fell in love with football,” Durde told the Guardian. “One day me and a kid down my street decided we wanted to play so we did. We loved it and found a team.”The rest might not be history, though, had Durde not grown to have the frame for football. Even now at 46, Durde, who stands at 6ft 1in and 240lb, doesn’t appear to have missed many lifting days at the gym.The rest might also not be history, though, without an outlet to play. Durde joined the British American Football League, which was the primary way for Brits to play American football from 1998 to 2010. There he excelled as a linebacker for the London Olympians before moving on to NFL Europe. After the 2005 season, Durde was allocated to the Carolina Panthers as part of the NFL International Development Practice Squad program – an initiative he would later transform.It was a short-lived stint; Durde was released after testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug. He went on to play for the Hamburg Sea Devils of NFL Europe, before being invited back to the NFL as a preseason practice squad player for the 2008 Kansas City Chiefs.View image in fullscreenAden Durde (No 54) played with the Hamburg Sea Devils of NFL Europe.Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Bongarts/Getty ImagesDespite the opportunity, it was clear he wasn’t going to be the next Singletary, let alone land on a full-time NFL roster. He pivoted away from the world of football for a few years before he felt the itch to coach.From 2011 to 2016, he served as the defensive coordinator for the London Warriors working under Tony Allen, who is still considered one of the most influential forces for American football development in the UK. While it was clear Durde had a knack for motivating players, he kept any dreams of coaching at a higher level in check.“If you look ahead to something you want to get, you won’t be doing your job particularly well,” he said. “Just really enjoy what you do and let people notice you.”People took notice. From 2014 to 2015, Durde worked as a coaching intern with the Dallas Cowboys through the NFL fellowship program. It was coaching grunt work, but the experience and exposure would prove invaluable.Meet the NFL outsiders: the players and coaches not born in the USARead moreAfter his internship, Durde returned to London, where he worked as a director of football development at the NFL UK office. Serendipitously, the desk next to his was occupied by a new co-worker: two-time Super Bowl champion and fellow BritonOsi Umenyiora.“It was a very random thing, but we spoke about how we could elevate the game by finding international players. He wanted to do the same thing, and we found an opportunity to present it to Roger Goodell and we did,” Durde said.What began as NFL Undiscovered quickly morphed into theInternational Player Pathway (IPP), a program to identify elite global talent with the aim of offering selected athletes the opportunity to earn a spot on an NFL roster. Seventy international players have signed with NFL teams, with 22 IPP athletes currently on NFL rosters. Since 2017, 11 of these players have been elevated to active rosters, includingJordan Mailata, an Australian rugby player turned starting left tackle for the Super Bowl-winning Philadelphia Eagles.It was a different program that connected Durde with Dan Quinn, another key figure in Durde’s rise. Durde arrived in Atlanta in 2016 via the Bill Walsh Coaching Fellowship and quickly impressed Quinn, then the Falcons’ head coach. Quinn hired Durde as a defensive quality control coach two years later, making Durde the first British full-time coach in NFL history. He studied under Quinn, one of the league’s top defensive minds, for four seasons, rising to outside linebackers coach in 2020.View image in fullscreenAden Durde worked alongside head coach Dan Quinn, one of the NFL’s top defensive minds, with the Atlanta Falcons.Photograph: Carmen Mandato/Getty ImagesAfter being ousted in Atlanta, Quinn became the defensive coordinator in Dallas. Durde joined to coach the line and thrived – in that 2023 season, he helped Parsons record a career-high 14 sacks.Now days from coaching in the Super Bowl, Durde takes a quick break from the stoicism, calling his journey “surreal” and being here “crazy” before noting the games leading up to Sunday have also been important.He knows what it means to be the first British coach in the Super Bowl but wants to ensure he’s not the last. “Yeah, the more opportunity for more people to get seen is real. Look at how the game is growing internationally. That’s how I can see,” he said, “Why limit it?”Durde remains the only full-time British coach, but there is another up-and-comer in the league: His son Kane, a scouting assistant for the Cowboys.“He’s making his own path. I do my best job to not get involved in that,” Durde said. “He is doing his own thing, and he’s building his own way of doing things. I’m so proud of him.”Despite not being Seattle’s playcaller, Durde is a hot commodity. The Falcons and Browns interviewed him for their head coach openings. There is speculation that he’ll be asked to join Klint Kubiak’s staff in Las Vegas when the current Seahawks offensive coordinator is named Raiders head coach next week. Quinn, now head coach of the Commanders, may try to poach him too. His future is clearly bright.From Evil Empire to Super Bowl underdogs: is it OK to like the Patriots now?Read more“He’s just one of the best coaches I’ve played for. It’s just the way he motivates me, the way he allows me to play my style of football, makes me play comfortable,” Seahawks defensive tackle Leonard Williams told theSeattle Times last month. “After a while, he just breathes so much life into you that it just makes you feel confident as a player, makes you trust yourself, makes you trust your teammates, makes you trust your coaches.”This week, Durde is happily in the Bay Area, analyzing Seattle’s defensive Super Bowl plan for thePatriots, keeping his players on track and letting his serious but friendly demeanor keep him grounded. And while he’s focused on coverages and matchups, he knows if the Seahawks players are nervous or tight on Super Bowl Sunday, he can break out the secret weapon.“When I speak with more of an English accent, I think they laugh,” he said. “If you can help people do that, that’s what coaching’s about.”Explore more on these topicsSuper BowlSuper Bowl LXSeattle SeahawksNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The punishment, determined by an independent disciplinary commission, leaves them outside the Championship relegation zone only on goal difference.A hearing took place in November after Leicester were alleged to have breached profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) for the three-season period ending with 2023-24. There were also two further charges against the club for failing to cooperate and failing to submit their financial accounts on time.Frank says Romero ‘dealt with internally’ for latest volley at Spurs ownersRead moreLeicester drop to 20th in theChampionship, level on points with West Bromwich Albion, who occupy the final relegation spot, and Blackburn.With Leicester outside the Premier League, the EnglishFootball Leagueissued the punishment with immediate effect. The EFL board met on Thursday to apply the sanction as per regulation 87.7 in its rules, which states the league “has the power to implement sanctions equivalent to those recommended by any independent Premier League commission or appeal board”.Leicester are considering an appeal. In a statement the club said: “It is with disappointment thatLeicester Cityacknowledges the independent commission’s decision and the club will use the time available to consider its next steps.”They deemed the penalty “disproportionate”, saying: “We are now reviewing the decision in full and considering the options available to us. We remain committed to engaging constructively and ensuring that any action is fair, proportionate and determined through the appropriate processes.”View image in fullscreenInterim manager Andy King will be in charge again this weekend when Leicester go to Birmingham.Photograph: John Mallett/ProSports/ShutterstockThe Premier League, which said the commission had recommended a six-point penalty, revealed that Leicester’s “improving financial position” across the period was used in mitigation during the week-long hearing.Leicester were found to have breached the relevant PSR threshold by £20.8m across the three-year period. The maximum permitted losses across the timeframe, taking in two seasons in the Premier League and one in the Championship, were £83m.The Premier League said: “The commission found that the club’s refusal to provide its annual accounts to the Premier League by the relevant deadline was a breach of Premier League rules.“It also dismissed a claim by the club that it had demonstrated exceptional cooperation throughout the proceedings. Following agreement by the parties, and consistent with the relevant guidelines, the commission agreed that the club’s improving financial position over the relevant assessment period was a mitigating factor.”Leicester, who have lost three of their past four league matches, are searching for a new head coach after sacking Martí Cifuentes last month, with their former midfielder Andy King – part of the squad that won the Premier League in 2016 – continuing in interim charge for Saturday’s trip to Birmingham. Leicester are close to appointing a technical director, to work alongside the longstanding director of football, Jon Rudkin, and a new chief executive.Cifuentes was removed from his role six months into a three-year contract. In a statement on Thursday, the Spaniard said: “From the moment me and my staff arrived we gave everything to try to help the club in building a fresh culture and set new standards during a challenging period … I wish everyone nothing but the best for what lies ahead in the future for your club.”Explore more on these topicsLeicester CityPremier LeagueChampionshipFootball LeagueFinancesnewsShareReuse this content"

Each side has the same chance of being pitted against any other club and, for those few moments, there is a special feeling. Hope.Women’s FA Cup to have seeded teams and no draw after last 32 under radical proposalsRead moreYet even this most innocent of simple traditions is no longer safe from the claws of commercialisation.Proposals put forward by the Football Associationrevealed in the Guardian, include a controversial plan to seed the top-four Women’s Super League sides from the previous season so they avoid each other. This seeding would create a road-to-Wembley bracket from the round of 32 onwards, doing away with draw ceremonies for last 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals altogether.The FA’s justification is that it would help the competition generate move revenue from broadcasters and commercial partners and, to be fair, there is nothing wrong with the FA wanting to innovate to address a lack of income for this competition. However, giving a leg-up to the four wealthiest clubs is certainly not the right way.Only four clubs have managed to win the Women’s FA Cup in the past 13 years (you’ll never guess which four would be seeded if these rules were in place this season). The implication is that the organisers feel only semi-final showdowns between the big four make the final commercially viable, but do they not realise how insulting that is to every other club taking part?Instead, why not do a better job of telling those human stories that make the earlier rounds of the competition so special?Seeding four clubs would be a “temporary adjustment” but it is not clear for how long. The FA, in its summary document – seen by the Guardian – appears to contradict itself. At first it says: “This proposal creates the highest chances of consistent high-quality matches throughout the later rounds of the competition.” But then later in the same paragraph, claims if would offer “a chance of a variation of fixtures”.View image in fullscreenManchester United supporters before the Women’s FA Cup final at Wembley.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAEqually, let us not pretend everything is rosy with the current situation. Having covered the competition since 2015, reporting on more than 50 ties, this reporter has never witnessed a giant-killing.There have been occasional upsets, but they are scarce. Since the WSL was founded in 2011, no top-flight side has been knocked out by a club from below the second tier, and even instances of WSL2 sides eliminating top-tier clubs are rare. Second-tier Birmingham’s 1-0 win at Everton in January 2023 was the last time that happened, and is one of only two since 2019.Mismatches, such as WSL2 leaders Charlton’s 10-0 victory over fourth-tier Swindon in this season’s fourth round, are not uncommon. Last year, Aston Villa thrashed Bristol Rovers 9-0, such is the chasm in resources between elite clubs and part-time or amateur sides in women’s football.The solution to that, though, is surely to filter more money and support down the pyramid to help lift the lower tiers rather than to boost the top four by further enhancing their chances of winning the £430,000 prize, a cash injection that is not needed by Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City or Manchester United but could do wonders for local community facilities.Overwhelmingly, fans’ reaction has been one of anger and bafflement. Of the 51 X users who had replied to this writer’s post about the proposed changes between Tuesday morning and Thursday morning, 50 were negative. In a powerful statement of opposition, the Manchester City Official Women’s Supporters Club “vehemently oppose these ideas”.“We feel it goes against the very ethos of what the FA Cup represents. The whole idea of being able to draw anyone, home or away, throughout the entire competition, gives it a unique magic that supporters of all clubs appreciate and embrace. Seeding the top four clubs would remove that magic and we feel strongly that it should not happen.”A spokesperson for the Football Supporters’ Association said: “The FSA is taking part in ongoing discussions with the FA as part of their review of the competition, during which fan representatives have expressed concern about proposals around seeding – something which fans feel goes against the traditions of the FA Cup.”Outlining its position, an FA spokesperson responded: “We committed in our women’s and girls’ game strategy, Reaching Higher, to review the Adobe Women’s FA Cup, recognising the need to evolve the competition and strengthen its commercial potential. This would enable us to reinvest more funding into both the competition itself and the wider women’s football ecosystem, which is vital for long-term, sustainable growth.“While a comprehensive review of the current format has been completed, no decisions have been made at this stage. Any future changes will be shaped in close consultation with stakeholders across the entire pyramid, including clubs, players, fans, and our broadcast and commercial partners.”The manager of Hull City Ladies, Chris Hames, whose third-tier side reached the fourth round, said: “I’m concerned by the direction they are trying to take the wider game, this being just another example of how there [are] only five or six clubs truly cared about in the women’s pyramid.”View image in fullscreenIpswich Town and Sheffield United players walk out on to the pitch for their fourth-round match in January, won 2-1 by the Blades.Photograph: Stephen Pond/The FA/Getty ImagesThere are other areas of concern within the FA’s proposals too, not least an “entry tier review” about which, in a leaked document, the organisers say: “We recognise the impact that this change would have on clubs playing in tier 7.”Additionally, bunching the latter rounds closer together in the calendar could have wider implications on league fixtures and sources at two WSL clubs have already raised concerns about potentially not being able to stage their derby fixture in its usual window during the men’s March international break.It is important to emphasise that no final decisions have yet been made – a period of consultation is taking place, before a final plan will be put to the FA board in April, so there is still time for stakeholders’ feedback to matter.The FA review’s wide-ranging scope, which has preceded these conversations, should be applauded for its breadth, and it does include some better conclusions, not least that the final should remain at Wembley. But fans have made it clear, , they want the proposal to seed four clubs eliminated.Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free email about women’s football, Moving the Goalposts.

Thursday, however, surely marked the first time it was asked whether ski jumpers were injecting their penises with hyaluronic acid in order to fly further.TheWadapresident Witold Banka’s reaction? “Ski jumping is very popular in Poland [Banka’s home country] so I promise you I’m going to look at it,” he said, with a wry smile.Heated rivalries and curling couples: 10 things to look out for at the Winter OlympicsRead moreAs crazy as it sounds, there are broader concerns surrounding this issue – which has been dubbed “Penisgate” – after they were first reported by the German newspaper Bild.Last year two of Norway’s Olympic medallists, Marius Lindvik and Johann André Forfang, were given three-month suspensions after the team was found to have secretly adjusted the seams of their suits around the crotch area at the 2025 World Ski Championships.Norway’s head coach Magnus Brevik, assistant coach Thomas Lobben, and staff member Adrian Livelten were also banned for 18 months for their involvement in the scheme, which made the jumpers’ suits larger and therefore reduced their descent rate due to the bigger wingspan.One study in the scientific journal Frontiers found that every 2cm in suit size circumference reduced drag by 4% and increased lift by 5%. It said that a 2cm change in the suits was equivalent to an extra 5.8 metres in jump length.However Bild has now claimed that jumpers have switched to other methods to game the system when they are measured for their suits, data for which is taken by a 3D scanner from the lowest point of their genitals. They include injecting acid into their penises or putting clay in their underwear to make their measurements temporarily bigger and therefore their suits looser for when they compete.The newspaper quoted a doctor, Kamran Karim, who said: “It is possible to achieve a temporary, visual thickening of the penis by injecting paraffin or hyaluronic acid. Such an injection is not medically indicated and is associated with risks.”These extraordinary rumours are yet to have been matched with any hard proof, although under Wada rules a method that endangers the health of an athlete and goes against the spirit of sport would be banned.Asked about the rumours, Olivier Niggli, the director general of Wada, said: “I’m not aware of the details of ski jumping – and how this can improve – but if anything was to come to the surface we would look at anything if it is actually doping related.“We don’t do other means of enhancing performance but our list committee would certainly look into whether this would fall into this category. But I hadn’t heard about that until you mentioned.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsWadaDrugs in sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Withreturning superstars, brand-new events and Italy leaning hard into its Olympic heritage, these Games may feel like they’ve arrived quietly – but there is a lot going on. From how and when to watch, to who matters and why these Olympics could look very different, here are your most pressing questions answered.Wait – there’s an Olympics happening?Yes. The 2026 Winter Olympics officially start on Friday and run through 22 February. Given where they land in a crowded sports calendar – withSuper Bowl LX on Sunday, the Premier Leaguein full swingand theAustralian Open having just finished– and considering it’s been less than 18 months since the Paris Summer Games ended, it’s easy to see how the Games might have snuck up on some fans.When do the Winter Olympics start?The Games officially begin on Friday with the opening ceremony, though several competitions will already be under way before then, including curling, ice hockey, luge, ski jumping, snowboarding and figure skating. As the Winter Olympics have grown – with longer schedules, more athletes and heavier broadcast demands – starting certain events early has become the only way to fit everything into the official Games window.Who is hosting the Winter Olympics?Italy is hosting the 2026 Winter Olympics. The Games are officially branded Milano Cortina 2026 and are spread across northern Italy, with Milan serving as the primary city host and Cortina d’Ampezzo anchoring the mountain events.What are the main Winter Olympics venues and locations?These Olympics are spread across northern Italy, with events clustered by geography and sport. Milan will host most of the indoor ice competitions – including ice hockey, figure skating and speed skating – and will also stage the opening ceremony. Cortina d’Ampezzo is the centerpiece for alpine events, hosting alpine skiing along with the sliding disciplines. Snowboarding and freestyle skiing will take place in Livigno. Biathlon events are based in Antholz, while ski mountaineering will be contested across multiple Alpine mountain courses designed for uphill-and-downhill racing.Olympic venues mapThis feels unusually spread out. Is it?Yes. Organizers have described it as the most geographically dispersed Winter Olympics ever. The upside is scenery and sustainability; the downside is complicated travel and logistics for athletes, media and fans.Why Italy, and why now?Italy last hosted the Winter Olympics in Turin in 2006, whileCortina d’Ampezzo hosted in 1956– the first Winter Games broadcast to an international audience. Milano Cortina leans heavily into that history while emphasizing existing venues, iconic mountain settings and fewer purpose-built stadiums.Where can I watch the opening ceremony?The opening ceremony takes place on 6 February at the San Siro stadium in Milan. In the US, it will air live on NBC and stream on Peacock, with primetime replays later that evening. In Australia you can watch on the Nine Network and Nine Now or stream it on Stan Sport. The BBC and CBC are the host broadcasters in the UK and Canada respectively. And, of course, the Guardian will be live blogging the ceremony – and the entire Games – for the next few weeks.Will Céline Dion be performing again?No, sorry to say. Instead, Mariah Carey is scheduled to headline. She will be joined by pianist Lang Lang, mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, tenor Andrea Bocelli, pop star Laura Pausini, and actors Pierfrancesco Favino, Sabrina Impacciatore and Matilda De Angelis. Organizers say the ceremony’s theme, Armonia (Italian for “harmony”), will focus on Italian culture, history and the country’s connection to the Olympic movement.View image in fullscreenMariah Carey is seen arriving at the airport on Monday ahead of the Milano Cortina Olympic games where she is set to perform at the opening ceremony.Photograph: Civetta/GC ImagesWhere can I watch the Winter Olympics 2026 online?Peacock is the main streaming destination in the US, offering live feeds, replays and event-specific streams across all sports.Will the time difference be an issue for audiences in North America?Not really. Italy is six hours ahead of the US east coast, meaning many finals will air live in the morning or early afternoon and replay in prime time. It’s a much friendlier schedule than the past two Winter Games in Asia.How do I find the Winter Olympics 2026 schedule?The timings for every Winter Olympic event can be foundhere.How is Team USA looking?The US has named a 232-athlete roster with an almost even gender split (117 men, 115 women). Ages range from 15-year-old freeskier Abby Winterberger to 54-year-old curler Rich Ruohonen.What are the big US storylines heading in?Besides Mariah Carey? Lindsey Vonn is attempting a remarkable comeback at 41 on her favorite mountainwith a completely ruptured ACL, while Mikaela Shiffrin chases redemptionafter a difficult Beijing Games. Speed skater Jordan Stolz is targeting a rare treble in the 500m, 1000m and 1500m. Ilia Malinin, America’sQuad God, is hotly tipped to win figure skating gold on the strength of his quadruple Axel, the dangerous four-and-a-half-revolution jumpno other skater in historyhas landed in competition. The US women’s figure skating teamdubbed the Blade Angels– led by Amber Glenn, Alysa Liu and Isabeau Levito – is chasing the country’s first women’s singles gold since 2002.View image in fullscreenSpeed skating sensation Jordan Stolz could become the second American to earn three gold medals at a single Winter Olympics.Photograph: Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty ImagesWho else should casual fans recognize?Chloe Kim, atwo-time Olympic gold medalistand one of the Games’ biggest crossover stars, is bidding for a historic third straight halfpipe gold amid injury concerns. Jessie Diggins and Alex Ferreira are also multiple-time medalists. Speed skater Erin Jackson, who became thefirst Black woman to win goldin any individual event at the Winter Games by winning the 500m in Beijing, will be defending her title.How about non-US stories?The return of NHL playersfor the first time since 2014means global superstars such as Connor McDavid, Sidney Crosby and the deep European powers will turn the Olympic tournament into something closer to a Stanley Cup-level competition. On home ice, Italy have multiple emotional centerpieces: ice dancers Charlene Guignard and Marco Fabbri chasing a long-elusive Olympic medal in what is likely their final Games, and short-track legend Arianna Fontana attempting an extraordinary double by racing both short track and long track.Elsewhere, Norway’s Johannes Høsflot Klæbo arrives chasing cross-country immortality with a potential multi-gold sweep. In sliding sports, the married skeleton duo of Belgium’s Kim Meylemans and Brazil’s Nicole Silveira are both realistic medal threats for nations that have never reached the Olympic podium in the event. And in curling, Italy’s defending mixed-doubles champions Amos Mosaner and Stefania Constantini return to compete in Cortina, at a historic venue, with the pressure and opportunity of defending gold in front of a home crowd.Which countries usually dominate the Winter Olympics?A small group of countries consistently dominates the Winter Games. Norway leads historically, driven by cross-country skiing, biathlon and Nordic combined, where medal opportunities are plentiful. Germany excels across biathlon and sliding sports like luge and bobsleigh. The United States thrives in alpine skiing, snowboarding and freestyle events, often peaking with generational stars. Canada is strongest in ice sports, particularly hockey and speed skating. Austria, Sweden and Switzerland round out the usual suspects, reflecting how climate, culture and deep development systems shape Winter Games success.What sports are in the Winter Olympics?There are 16 Winter Olympic disciplines, including alpine skiing, biathlon, bobsleigh, cross-country skiing, curling, figure skating, freestyle skiing, ice hockey, luge, Nordic combined, short track speed skating, skeleton, ski jumping, ski mountaineering, snowboarding and speed skating.Are there any new sports at the Winter Olympics?Yes. Ski mountaineeringmakes its Olympic debut.Skinning, boot-packing and downhill skiing: welcome to skimo at the Winter OlympicsRead moreWhat is ski mountaineering?Ski mountaineering blends uphill endurance racing with downhill speed. Athletes climb steep alpine terrain using skins attached to their skis, then descend at race pace. Long popular in Europe, it enters the Olympic program for the first time in 2026.Anything new within familiar sports?New medal events include dual moguls in freestyle skiing, men’s and women’s doubles in luge (replacing the open doubles event), team alpine combined for men and women, women’s large hill ski jumping, plus a mixed team relay in skeleton.What events should casual fans prioritize?Downhill skiing, figure skating, snowboard halfpipe and speed skating have typically been the blue-riband events, at least from the American perspective. And, later, ice hockey once the knockout rounds begin.Is the Winter Olympics hockey rink really smaller than the NHL?Yes – slightly. The main hockey rink in Milan is smaller than a standard NHL surface, which could lead to faster play, tighter spacing and more physical games, particularly in the medal rounds.View image in fullscreenA general view of the work at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena on Thursday, one week before the start of the competitions of the Winter Games.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesIs Russia in the Winter Olympics?Yes – but only in limited form. Russian athletes are allowed to compete only as Individual Neutral Athletes.What does neutral status actually mean?Neutral athletes cannot compete under Russia’s flag, wear national symbols or hear their anthem if they win. Team sports such as hockey are excluded entirely, meaning no Alexander Ovechkin or other Russian NHL stars. Athletes must also pass strict eligibility checks set by the International Olympic Committee, including showing they have not publicly supported the war in Ukraine or had ties to military or security services.Russian officials have suggested as many as 15 to 20 could qualify, though far fewer have been approved so far. The total is expected to be lower than the 15 who competed at the Paris Olympics.What’s the Olympic village like?Milano Cortina 2026 will not have a single Olympic village. Instead, organizers are using a decentralised, six-village model spread across northern Italy, reflecting the wide geographic spread of venues. Athletes will be housed in villages in Milan, Cortina d’Ampezzo, Livigno, Bormio, Predazzo and Anterselva, using a mix of new construction, temporary structures and existing hotels.The largest purpose-built site is in Milan’s Porta Romana district, where a new village will later be converted into student housing. In Cortina, athletes will stay in a temporary village of 377 mobile homes housing about 1,400 people, located north of town. The units are compact and functional, with shared facilities and exposure to alpine weather, and will be dismantled after the Games. Most teams plan to use the villages, though Norway has opted to house its athletes in hotels instead.Do they really have a lot of sex in there?Yes, but it’s more mundane than the legend suggests. The Olympic Villagehas a long-running reputationas a hookup hotspot, and there’s some truth to it: thousands of young, elite athletes in close quarters, away from home, riding adrenaline highs. Organizers don’t discourage it – free condomsare a standard fixture– but the reality is lessCaligulaand morecollege dorm during finals week. Many athletes are exhausted, intensely focused on competition or sleeping at odd hours, and teams often impose curfews, room rules and monitoring, especially before events.Milano Cortina’s decentralized setup may further temper the lore. With athletes split across six villages – from dense urban Milan to remote alpine bases – there’s no single social epicenter. Some competitors avoid the Village entirely until they’re finished competing, others bring partners or family, and most are far more concerned with recovery, routines and avoiding illness than living out the stereotype. Sex happens, but for most Olympians it’s a side note, not the point.How much do tickets cost for the Winter Olympics?Prices vary widely. Some early-round events start at under €30, while high-demand events such as figure skating finals and hockey medal games can cost several hundred euros.Will ICE agents be at the Winter Olympics?Yes, but with limits. A small unit from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement will have a security support role at the Milan–Cortina Winter Olympics, US and Italian officials have confirmed. ICE agents from its investigative arm, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), will assist the US State Department’s Diplomatic Security Service and liaise with Italian authorities on threats such as transnational crime.1:58Why are ICE agents going to the Winter Olympics in Italy? – video explainerThey will not carry out immigration enforcement or police operations, and all security remains under Italian control. Italian officials stressed the agents will work from operations rooms – including a US-run centre at the Milan consulate – rather than patrol streets or venues.The confirmation has sparked protests and political backlash in Italy, with critics calling ICE’s presence unacceptable. Several local leaders and opposition parties have launched petitions opposing the deployment. Italian ministers have sought to calm tensions, emphasising that ICE’s role is advisory and investigative, not operational.So, bottom line – why should I care?Because Milano Cortina brings together star power, history and real competitive stakes in a way the last Winter Games in Beijing – staged largely in empty venues because of Covid – simply couldn’t. This is shaping up to feel like a full, proper Olympics again.This article was amended on 5 February 2026.

Two of their gold medal-winning athletes from Beijing 2022, including the defending Olympic champion on the long hill, were banned for three months after a whistleblower published a video of their coach tampering with the (strictly regulated) crotch stitching on their jumpsuits at the Nordic world championships last year, in an attempt to make them more aerodynamic by adding padding. Groin-gate led to a national debate about ethics in sport and a complete overhaul of the rules. We’re told doctors are now using “3D measurements” to carefully scrutinise all competing athletes before competition.View image in fullscreenAll eyes on Norway’s defending Olympic large hill ski jump gold medalist, Marius Lindvik.Photograph: Tom Weller/Getty ImagesFrosty US-Canada relationsAfter a 12-year holdout, the National Hockey League has finally agreed to let its players participate in the Olympics again, which means the ice hockey tournament at Milano Cortina is going to be a proper test of the world’s best for the first time since Sochi in 2014. Russia have been banned from the competition, but given the current state of relations between Canada and the US there’s still going to be plenty of geopolitical needle. The opening match between the two during the Four Nations last year started withthree fights in the first nine seconds, and any game between them in the knockout rounds is going to be the single hottest ticket of the Olympics.Elbows up.Skeleton sabotage?But before all that, the two countries have things to thrash out on the ice track. The run-up to the Games has been dominated by a row over the women’s skeleton, after the Canadian coach Joe Cecchini gerrymandered the final qualification event by withdrawing several of his own competitors to ensure one of them made it to the Games ahead of USA’s Katie Uhlaender. According to Uhlaender, who would have been competing in her sixth and last Olympics, Cecchini was entirely unrepentant about it. He’s been cleared of any wrongdoing. But Uhlaender has pursued her case through a tribunal all the way to the court of arbitration for sport, and has even been calling on the US vice-president, JD Vance, to intervene for her at the IOC.View image in fullscreenKatie Uhlaender’s absence from the Games has caused a scandal in the skeleton bob world.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty ImagesHeated Rivalry takeoverThe Canadians are also making a fine display of their soft power. They roped in Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie, stars of theworld’s favourite ice hockey themed gay romance Heated Rivalry, to carry the Olympic torch. Apparently it just wasn’t hot enough already. The Canadian team have a history of turning out the Games’ iconic merchandise. In 1998 it was the baggy poor boy hats, in 2010 it was the big red mittens. This year’s gear is being provided by Lululemon, but everyone’s really after a replica of the Heated Rivalry national team fleece Williams’s character, Shane Hollander, wears on the show. Province of Canada have just announced they’re making it available for sale.Mark Carney’s already wearing his.‘Neutral’ Russian athletesThirteen Russian athletes will be competing, along with seven Belarusians. They’ll be registered as neutral athletes, having apparently satisfied “background checks” that they don’t publicly support the invasion of Ukraine, conducted by a three person-panel, who are, bizarrely, made up of a retired Japanese gymnastics coach, a retired synchronised swimmer from Aruba, and the former Memphis Grizzlies forward Pau Gasol. Their combined expertise hasn’t done anything to reassure the Ukrainian athletes in alpine, cross-country, and freestyle skiing, speed and figure skating and the luge, who now have to compete against “neutral” representatives of the nation waging war on them.Klæbo’s bid for historyWhile everyone else’s attention is elsewhere, Norway’s Johannes Høsflot Klæbo will be skiing, slowly, into the history books. Klæbo may just be the greatest endurance athlete on the planet. He has already won seven Olympic medals, but he reached entirely new heights at the world championships last year when he won all six of his events across 12 days of competition, from the 1500m sprint through to the 50km slog. The clean sweep had never been done before. If he can repeat the feat across 15 days of competition in Italy, he would become the first athlete in history to win six gold medals at a single Winter Games, as well as one of the most decorated Olympians in history.View image in fullscreenOff goes Johannes Høsflot Klæbo!Photograph: Leo Authamayou/NordicFocus/Getty ImagesSay hello to skimoIt wouldn’t be the Olympics without an obscure new sport being included on the roster; this year it’s ski mountaineering (“skimo” to those in the know) in which athletes run up a mountain and ski back down it again in what may or may not be best understood as an elaborate metaphor for the human condition. Competitors wear skins on their skis for the uphill, before taking the skis off to trot up the steepest bits, and then putting them back on to come down again. The whole thing takes three minutes. We can only hope its does as well as ski ballet, bandy, and military patrol, and some of other sports the Winter Games has offered over the years.All downhill for ItalyThe hosts have set themselves a target of winning 19 medals, which is looking pretty steep after a series of recent injuries. They still have high hopes of Stefania Constantini and Amos Mosaner in the mixed doubles curling, and the double Olympic champion Arianna Fontana in the short track skating, but the one the nation will stop for is the women’s downhill, where the implausibly brave and impossibly quick Sofia Goggia is to go against her friend, and mentor, Lindsey Vonn, who had come out of retirement and is confident of competingdespite a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament. Goggia won their last Olympic head-to-head, taking the gold medal in 2018.View image in fullscreenHome favourite Sofia Goggia.Photograph: Alain Grosclaude/Agence Zoom/Getty ImagesCelebs go skatingAnd just when you thought the Games might give you a chance to get away from all this sort of thing, up pops Jake Paul. His fiancee, Jutta Leerdam, will be competing for the Netherlands in the long track speed skating. She was already a celebrity in her home country, where the sport’s a national obsession, after she won six world championships and an Olympic silver in Beijing, but her relationship with Paul, which – like all great 21st-century romances – started when he sent her an Instagram message inviting her to appear on his podcast, has turned her into one of the highest-profile athletes at these Olympics.Curling power couplesThe great love stories of the Games, though, are in the mixed doubles curling competition, which features not one but two married couples. The Canadian pair of Brett Gallant and Jocelyn Peterman fell in love when they teamed up to try to qualify for the event in 2018. They failed that time. And again in 2022. Eight years later, now married with a kid, they finally made it. Their match on 5 February will pit them against another couple, Magnus Nedregotten and Kristin Skaslien from Norway, whose marriage has, amazingly, managed to survive the fact that they lost the gold-medal match against Italy four years ago.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As director of national intelligence, she has no domestic law enforcement authority, making her presence at an FBI raid out of the ordinary.Trump’s account at the prayer breakfast marked a departure from remarks in aninterview with NBC Newson Wednesday. “I don’t know,” Trump said when asked why Gabbard was present, before suggesting, without offering evidence, that China had interfered in the 2020 election.Asked about the apparent discrepancy at a White House briefing on Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed Trump’s remarks in the NBC interview had been taken out of context.“He just said exactly what I told you, which is that election security is essential to national security. We need to ensure that our elections are free and are fair and are free of foreign interference,” Leavitt said.“So you’re taking the first three words he said to one question and not looking at his entire response.”Her explanation, however, blurred a key distinction: while Gabbard has authority to oversee intelligence assessments related to election security, she has no formal role in domestic law enforcement operations.The statement also conflicted with a letter Gabbard sent on Wednesday to senior lawmakers in the House and Senate, in which she said she had attended the raid at Trump’s instructions and had been present only briefly.“My presence was requested by the president and executed under my broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyze intelligence related to election security,” Gabbard wrote.The Guardianhas previously reportedGabbard is conducting her own review of the 2020 election through her office with Trump’s approval – working separately from the justice department investigation – and that she was sent to observe the raid as part of that effort.That review comes as Trump has renewed his focus on the 2020 election nearly six years after his loss to Joe Biden. Two administration officials familiar with the matter said Gabbard, for months, has been briefing Trump and top advisers every few weeks.The two investigations – by Gabbard and the justice department – into the 2020 election underscore its importance to Trump, and Gabbard being sent to the raid showed the interest on voting machine manipulation claims that Trump has cited as evidence the election was stolen.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS elections 2020FBIGeorgianewsShareReuse this content"

The board estimates this option would last 19 to 24 years and cost up to £15.6bn.A “staged decant”, which would vacate theHouse of Lordsfor between 8 and 13 years while the Commons would move to the Lords Chamber for up to two years, would take 38 to 61 years and cost up to £39.2bn.MPs and peers have also been asked to agree to the initial £3bn restoration works at the Houses of Parliament, which would include refurbishing the inside of the Victoria Tower, building a jetty on the Thames for deliveries by river and commencement of underground tunnel shafts. The works would last seven years, and could start in 2026 if approved. The board will then ask them to choose between the final two options by mid-2030.MPs, peers and senior parliamentary officials are divided on the best way to carry out urgently needed reparation works to the mainly Victorian building, despite widespread misgivings that ancient wiring, asbestos and unsafe masonry could result in a catastrophic incident at the Unesco Westminster world heritage site.Fire could ‘burn down’ UK parliament and asbestos is rife, surveys showRead moreThe House of Lords has frequent heating failures, problems with its sewerage system and forced closure of toilets because of the presence of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC). Since 2016, there have been 36 fire incidents, 12 asbestos incidents and 19 stonemasonry incidents on the estate.The report from the restoration board argues that the state of the Palace of Westminster has become critical, with £1.5m spent every week on maintenance and repairs. The number of maintenance jobs increased by 70% between 2021 and 2024.But the shadow speaker of the house, Jesse Norman, warned that despite more than a decade of delays, key decisions were being made behind closed doors with no individual or body held responsible for a budget “more appropriate to HS2 than to parliament”.“The costed proposals report is asking parliamentarians to approve eye-watering expenditures […] on a project with unclear governance, limited scrutiny and low confidence of effective project or cost management,” he said.Norman, a member of theHouse of Commons commission, which is responsible for the palace’s maintenance, wrote to the board in December and criticised a proposal for a new three-board structure to oversee the project.“It is not hard to see how this could increase bureaucracy, delay, dispersion of responsibility and confusion,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPalace of WestminsterHouse of CommonsHouse of LordsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

His brother, David Zini, is the head of the Shin Bet, the domestic intelligence agency. He was appointed by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, last May and began the job in October.Israel has long controlled all goods going into Gaza and enforced a total blockade at the height of the war thatled to widespread famine. Smuggling was rife under blockade, and cigarettes were a luxury for the very few. At the peak of the conflict, a single cigarette could sell for $15 (£11) and a carton of 50 packets could cost nearly $15,000 (£11,060).It is alleged that some Israeli soldiers taking part in the devastation of Gaza, in which more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed, were also profiting from a campaign that is considered by aUN independent commissionand human rights organisations to be a genocide.According to his indictment announced on Thursday, Bezalel Zini, 50, is suspected of smuggling approximately 14 cartons of cigarettes intoGazaon three separate trips into the occupied territory, for which he allegedly received roughly $120,000 (£88,700).View image in fullscreenDavid Zini was appointed as head of the Shin Bet last May and began the job in October.Photograph: Olivier Fitoussi/AFP/Getty ImagesThe justice ministry accused Zini and his co-defendants of “assisting the enemy in wartime, performing transactions in property for terrorist purposes, obtaining something by fraud under aggravated circumstances, and taking bribes”.“A central category of prohibited goods smuggled into the strip was tobacco and cigarettes, which have put a total of hundreds of millions of shekels into Hamas’s coffers since the start of the war,” a ministry statement said.The ministry said the network had also smuggled iPhones, batteries, car parts and other goods into Gaza, alongside cigarettes, in an operation it said began last year.Zini’s defence lawyers said their client denied the charges. “Regarding the offence of aiding the enemy during wartime, it is a complete inversion of reality,”Haaretz quoted the legal teamas saying. The lawyers played down the severity of the alleged offences, arguing: “It’s only about cigarettes [and] any claim of aiding the enemy is baseless.”Zini is officially an Israeli army reservist but was also part of a small semi-official unit known as the Uriah Force, substantially made up of rightwing extremist volunteers, who reportedly brought bulldozers and other heavy equipment into Gaza and took part in widespread demolitions during the war. According to aninvestigation last September in Haaretz, the Uriah Force operated outside the official army chain of command.The indictment accuses Zini of “exploiting his position” and using the cover of moving Uriah Force equipment in and out of Gaza to smuggle the cigarettes.The rightwing newspaper Israel Hayom criticised the silence of the Shin Bet chief, David Zini, over his brother’s involvement in the affair.“Zini should not be punished for his brother’s actions (assuming he is convicted),” the newspaper said. “But he must tell the Israeli public the truth about treason allegations and other conspiracy theories, including in connection to the current affair.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But bull sharks – known for their ability to tolerate freshwater, as well as their adaptability to near-shore waters and river mouths – are among the most commonly implicated in attacks in the region.Bull shark encounters tend to occur when conditions favour feeding activity including warmer water temperatures, murky seas after heavy rainfall and periods of low visibility such as dawn and dusk.Other shark species commonly involved in attacks across Australia include tiger sharks, which – like bull sharks – prefer tropical waters, and great white sharks, which favour cooler, more temperate waters.Other states that have reported shark attacks over the years includeQueensland, especially around areas such asthe Whitsunday Islands, where proximity to tropical waters increases shark activity.Western Australia, known for its rich marine biodiversity, has also recorded shark activity over time, includingfatal attacksin the state’s south, aroundEsperancein2025and 2020, inPerth in 2023and2021, and recent interactionsat Margaret Riverand further north near Exmouthin 2025.Are there specific conditions when shark encounters are more likely?Speaking to the Guardian, Jodie Rummer, a marine biology professor at James Cook University, said; “Shark behaviour is driven by food availability, temperature and environmental conditions … Sharks respond quickly to these ecological cues because they are following prey, not people.”Rummer added: “Warmer water increases a shark’s metabolic demand, meaning they need to spend more time actively foraging. As climate change warms coastal waters and increases the frequency and intensity of storms, the environmental backdrop is shifting. This does not change the nature of sharks, but it can influence when and where encounters are more likely.”In which months are sharks most active in Australia?Sharks have been known tofollow whale migrationsalong Australia’s east coast, which generally take place between April to October or November.Bull sharks, which prefer temperatures above 20C, aremost activeacross Australia’s southern coastlines during warmer months, particularly from January to February.Meanwhile, great whites favour slightly cooler waters, mostly ranging from 20C or below. As a result, these sharks are often most activeduringlate winter and spring across NSW with peaks in activity from August to November.In WA, great white sharks are typically most activebetweenSeptember and December, as warmer waters and increased prey availability draw them closer to shore.In Queensland, highest levels of shark activity are usuallyreportedaround the summer months of December to February, largely due to the warmer waters.Is it riskier to swim at dawn, dusk and at night?Yes. Experts warn that swimming in low light conditions including before dawn, after dusk and at night carries added risk, due to lower visibility for both people and sharks.Speaking of bull sharks, Christopher Pepin-Neff, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney who studies shark encounters and policy responses said: “They can’t really see what they are biting into in those periods so people get bitten more often when we bump into them.”How do weather events such as heavy rains or floods affect shark activity?Pepin-Neff noted that bull sharks often hide ahead of intense weather events, which can increase the likelihood of shark-human encounters in rivers and estuaries.“If you live on a river and a storm is coming in three days, they would have gone up that river three days ago so the river would have been more dangerous three days before the storm … Animals are hiding because the storm is coming and they may be agitated, they may be stressed,” they said.Murky waters after heavy rainfall or cyclones can also further raise the risk of encounters, with Pepin-Neff describing the “quarter of inch or rain on top of saltwater” as a “little biodiversity explosion.”“They’re looking for the baitfish that follow those biodiversity explosions,” they said, with Rummer adding that since bull sharks can tolerate brackish and freshwater for “extended periods … they frequently move through estuaries and river systems, especially after heavy rain when food availability can increase.”View image in fullscreenA general view of the beach at Nielsen park, also known as Shark beach, in Sydney.Photograph: Sitthixay Ditthavong/EPADo activities like surfing or wearing certain colours increase risk?“Often around those times where there’s a flooding incident, there’s also a great surf so surfers tend to just want to go out,” said Rebecca Olive, a marine research fellow at RMIT University in Melbourne.“Surfers are really interested in waves rather than water quality,” said Olive, who urged surfers, swimmers and other beachgoers to assess water conditions first, undertake first aid training and keep a first aid kit in their car.Beachgoers are also advised to avoid high-contrast colours, as some sharks, including bull sharks, are more sensitive to contrast than colour.“We don’t wear yellow,” said Pepin-Neff, referring to the colour as “yum yum yellow,” a term used by divers and experts. “Underwater, [yellow] looks like opportunistic flesh,” they said, adding: “I’d rather have black and be mistaken for a seal than wear yellow and be mistaken for a flesh pop.”What is the safest place to swim at the beach in Australia?Swimmers should stay between the red and yellow safety flags on the beaches, Robert Harcourt, a marine ecology professor at Sydney’s Macquarie University, advised. He said: “[Beach patrollers] also use drones to look for sharks on patrolled beaches and they focus on the red and yellow flags to make sure people can be pulled out … The lifeguards are also looking for sharks, as well as making sure people don’t drown.”Harcourt also advised surfers to surf in groups, saying: “If there’s 50 of you, one is much more likely to see a shark coming … as well as the confusion effect – there’s a lot of things kicking around, actually, it’s more intimidating for sharks.”At the same time, Olive urged for greater ocean awareness, acknowledging both the concerns people have towards sharks as well as the importance of understanding marine environments.“I think if you are using a place regularly, it’s good to learn something about it. You could do that by asking the people you swim or surf with … go see your local dive centre, ask when you’re buying fish at the fish shop, you can talk to the fishers about what’s going on in the bays,” she said.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsSharksMarine lifeexplainersShareReuse this content"

In real terms, accounting for inflation, this would represent a cut of about 40% in spending power since 2021, when the £11.6bn budget was agreed.The slashing of climate aid, imposed by the Treasury, is planned despite recentwarnings from the UK’s spy chiefsthat the collapse of ecosystems such as the Amazon or the Congo would inflict serious damage on the UK’s national security,including soaring food prices and the risk of war.It comes just a year afterthe UK and other rich countries promised to triple global climate finance to the poor worldto $300bn (£220bn) a year by 2035, in recognition of the disasters countries are already experiencing. Although that deal did not specify how much must come from each, a reduction from the UK will make the total harder to reach.Mohamed Adow, the director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: “For vulnerable countries, UK climate finance isn’t an abstract budget line – it’s the difference between resilience and disaster. Cutting it at this moment will cost lives and livelihoods.”View image in fullscreenPeople cycle on the dried out Lake Chilwa in Malawi.Photograph: Amos Gumulira/AFPDonald Trump is withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement and its parent treaty,the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and hasscrapped the US’s climate finance targets. Adow said: “If the UK breaks its commitments, it gives cover for others to do the same, with devastating consequences for global climate action.”Ministers are still arguing over the details of the new round of international climate finance, called ICF4 within the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, the fourth such round of financing since 2010. The money comes from the overseas aid budget, which wasslashed last year to 0.3% of gross national income(a measure similar to GDP). Until 2021, when it was cut to 0.5% by Boris Johnson, the UK devoted 0.7% of GDP to foreign aid.The £9bn climate spending pledge is likely to equate to £2bn a year over the next three years, then £1.5bn a year in 2029-30 and 2030-31, which is beyond the current parliament. The Treasury is understood to be reluctant to commit cash beyond the current three-year plan for all government spending, but other departments, and several committees of MPs, have argued that a five-year period is necessary.Chart showing UK's international climate finance spending from 2012 to 2026 and forecast figures up to 2031In addition to the headline cuts, the Guardian has learned that civil servants are scrambling to “rebadge” existing projects focused on issues such as education or health under the climate finance umbrella. Some officials claim that up to 30% of aid to the least developed countries can be counted as climate finance, even though the projects involved may have little or no influence on the climate crisis.Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, did not attend the Cop30 summit in Brazil last November, and is said to have received her first major briefing on the climate only last December. While David Lammy, the previous foreign secretary, attended Cop meetings, made prominent speeches on climate issues and appointed a climate envoy and a nature envoy, Cooper is said to be more interested in issues such as girls’ education.Funding for nature conservation could also be slashed, and arguments are ongoing over the future of the ringfence around £3bn of the ICF budget for nature spending. Flagship projects such as theBlue Planet Fund, set up to help protect the oceans after public concern raised byDavid Attenborough’s TV series, are likely to be kept in place but are set for a “haircut”, according to sources.View image in fullscreenPeople cross an area flooded by the Chenab River in Punjab Province, Pakistan, last year. Millions of people were affected after heavy monsoon rains, melting glaciers and water releases from Indian dams caused three rivers to overflow.Photograph: Mansoor Abbas/EPADeveloping country experts told the Guardian that slashing the climate budget would harm the UK’s national interest, as well as hurt the poor. Harjeet Singh, the cofounder of the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation, said: “The UK cannot claim to be a climate leader while retreating from its finance commitments. This move shreds the UK’s standing on the world stage, proving to the global south that British promises are hollow, and that its ambition is shrinking, not leading.”Jonathan Hall, the managing director of Conservation International UK, said therecent report by the Joint Intelligence Committeeshowed that failure to help poor countries protect nature would affect inflation and national security in the UK. “If you care about food prices you should care about the potential collapse of the rainforests, if you care about global security you should care about the melting of the Himalayan glaciers,” he said, using examples cited in the report.He said theringfence on spending for naturemust remain. “Protecting nature and our climate are not just nice things to do – they are essential to the social and economic stability and national security of the UK. That is why it is essential that the government commits at least one-third of our climate budget to programmes that protect nature for people.”Several experts also said that one of the biggest problems with UK climate finance was the lack of transparency over its spending, exacerbated since Brexit as the UK no longer abides by the EU’s reporting standards. “We could get to a situation where thelabel ‘climate finance’is meaningless, as we will have no idea what it is really spent on and where,” said one.A government spokesperson said: “The UK remains committed to providing international climate finance, playing our part alongside other developed countries and climate finance providers to deliver our international commitments. The UK is on track to deliver £11.6bn in international climate finance by the end of this financial year. We are modernising our approach to ensure we focus on greater impact – ensuring every pound delivers for the UK taxpayer and the people we support.”Explore more on these topicsClimate aidClimate financeClimate crisisForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Last year, the UN adopted an indicator of progress known as total applied toxicity (TAT), which factors in the different levels of harm that chemicals cause different species.To monitor progress toward the biodiversity pledge, the researchers used the TAT framework and safety thresholds from seven regulatory authorities around the world to develop a globally consistent measure of damage from 625 pesticides.Jakob Wolfram, an ecotoxicologist at RPTU University Kaiserslautern-Landau and lead author of the study, said he was “highly concerned” by the trend, especially in developing countries and regions with high biodiversity.“It should be a stark warning that applied toxicities are still increasing in many regions, particularly for species groups that serve vital ecological functions,” he said.The study, which examined 65 countries representing almost 80% of farmland on the planet, found total applied toxicity fell in Europe, which began to phase out neonicotinoids in 2013, and China, which introduced a zero-growth-pesticide policy in 2015.However, toxicity increased considerably in much of Africa, India, the US, Brazil and Russia. Chile is the only country on track to meet the UN target of reducing pesticide risk by 50% by 2030, the study found.View image in fullscreenInsects have suffered the greatest increase in harm from synthetic farm chemicals between 2013 and 2019, the study shows.Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesMónica Martínez Haro, a wildlife toxicologist at Spain’s National Research Council, who was not involved in the study, described the research as “highly relevant and high-quality” but said the results may be partly underestimated given limitations in the data.She said pesticides were designed to act lethally on target organisms but could also act “sub-lethally and silently” on other organisms, masking some of their effects on ecological health.Martínez Haro said: “This is a key study that highlights the urgent need for substantial measures at a global level – such as agricultural diversification, less intensive soil management, greater conversion to organic farming, and the switch to less toxic pesticides – if the United Nations’ goal of safeguarding biodiversity is to be achieved.”Synthetic chemicals that kill pests have increased the productivity of farmland, allowing more food to be grown on the same area, but have harmed the ecosystems in which they are used.The researchers studied 2013 to 2019 because it had the best global data coverage, but said applied toxicity had probably continued to rise as pesticide application trends have continued. Farmers around the world spray about 4m tons of pesticides each year, nearly double what they did in the 1990s.Wolfram said the global rise in applied toxicities of pesticides for most species groups suggested that ecosystems had become “increasingly impaired” by pesticides. “[This] directly counteracts the risk reduction target set out by the UN’s GlobalBiodiversityFramework.”While the new tool allowed the world to gauge progress towards the target, Wolfram added, the pesticide application data needed was sparsely available for most countries, and often of insufficient quality. “One central call from our study is that long-term, high-quality data is needed globally to assess the current status and trends of applied toxicities.”Explore more on these topicsPesticidesInsectsFarmingBiodiversityConservationWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

It added that this information was already available in sectors such as rail, and a standard framework would help aviation’s ambitions to become net zero for carbon emissions by 2050.The CAA director, Tim Johnson, said: “Airlines providing understandable and comparable emissions data will enable passengers to make more informed travel decisions. We encourage all airlines and travel companies that advertise or sell flights in the UK which depart from or arrive at UK airports to follow this guidance.”Emissions per passenger are typically lowest on short-haul, fuel-efficient modern fleets with large numbers packed into economy seats – a fact that has encouraged airlines such as Ryanair and Wizz Air to regularly publicise their CO2per head figures.Airlines were broadly accepting of the move duringa consultation held by the CAA in 2024, although questions were raised about the limits of the data, with factors such as changes to flight paths, aircraft and bookings all affecting accuracy.The environmental campaign group Cagne, which was among those lobbying for the change, said the guidance was welcome but it was “imperative that there is transparency” and that consumers could understand the magnitude of emissions released, per passenger per flight.A spokesperson for Cagne said the airlines should “provide comprehensive data in the simplest form to the consumer in the same way that smokers are told how they are damaging their health by smoking”.Explore more on these topicsAirline industryAirline emissionsRegulatorsAir transportAir pollutionPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

He also claimed the deal was one of many “national security reasons” why the US should acquire Greenland.Under the deal, Britain would cede control over the islands toMauritiusbut lease the largest, Diego Garcia, for 99 years to continue operating a joint US-UK military base there.Trump endorsed the handoverwhen Starmer visited the White House last year.But posting on Truth Social last month, Trump wrote: “There is no doubt that China and Russia have noticed this act of total weakness.“The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.”But after a “very productive” phone call with Starmer on Thursday, Trump appeared to backtrack to a position of approval for the deal.The US president wrote on Truth Social that Diego Garcia was “strategically situated in the middle of the Indian Ocean and, therefore, of great importance to the National Security of the United States”.He added that US military operations have succeeded over the past year “because of the strength of our warfighters, modern capability of our equipment and, very importantly, the strategic location of our Military Bases.“I understand that the deal Prime Minister Starmer has made, according to many, the best he could make.”But Trump added: “If the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers U.S. operations and forces at our Base, I retain the right to Militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia.“Let it be known that I will never allow our presence on a Base as important as this to ever be undermined or threatened by fake claims or environmental nonsense.”After Starmer and Trump’s phone call, a Downing Street spokesperson said they “agreed on the importance of the deal to secure the joint UK-US base on Diego Garcia, which remains vital to shared security interests”.The pair also agreed that the “UK and US will continue to work closely on the implementation of the deal”, the spokesperson said.The Conservative party and Reform UK have been highly critical of the Chagos Islands deal. Reacting to Trump’s announcement, Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “The president’s statement today recognises a critical weakness in the surrender deal – the lease could fall apart, leaving our national security and that of our allies in even greater doubt. The deal is clearly a threat to our national security and is a massive strategic blunder.“The Conservative party’s view is unchanged. We have led the fight against this appalling surrender and we will continue fighting it to the end.”Trump’s reversal comes after he softened his plan to take control of Greenland, which is a semi-autonomous territory belonging to Denmark, a Nato member.After talks with Nato’s secretary-general, Mark Rutte, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum last month, Trump announced that a “framework of a future deal” on Greenland had been reached after weeks of escalating threats.Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsDonald TrumpKeir StarmerForeign policyUS foreign policyMauritiusnewsShareReuse this content"

Emails released by the US Department of Justice show Mandelson sought help from Jeffrey Epstein to find “rich individuals” as clients.Mandelson’s links with US tech firm Palantir must be fully exposed, campaigners warnRead moreThe government has for months blocked attempts by MPs and campaigners to scrutinise Palantir’s deals. Requests for information about meetings between the company’s leadership with Keir Starmer and the former prime minister Boris Johnson were among those that have been refused.With Palantir now expanding its AI-powered technology into British policing, the government is facing calls to freeze its involvement with theDenver-based company, which was co-founded by the Donald Trump-backing billionaire Peter Thiel, who also had a relationship with Epstein. It also provides its military technology to the Israel Defense Forces and to Trump’s ICE immigration crackdown.On Thursday, Martin Wrigley MP, a Liberal Democrat member of the Commons technology select committee, called for a parliamentary debate on “the suitability of Palantir” as a supplier to critical national infrastructure. Wrigley told the Guardian: “I would halt any further contracts with Palantir until we have a clear picture of how these [existing contracts] came about.”The Green party leader,Zack Polanski, wrote to the health secretary, Wes Streeting, urging him to break a £330m contract between Palantir and the NHS. The deal to run a “federated data platform” has faced opposition from the British Medical Association, with some NHS trusts having raising doubts about its effectiveness.Polanski said Palantir “has absolutely no place in the NHS, looking after patients’ personal data … I understand there is a break clause in the contract this year and I would urge you not to renew the contract of such a disreputable corporation”.A spokesperson for Palantir said its “software is helping to deliver better public services in the UK. That includes delivering more NHS operations, helping Royal Navy ships to stay at sea for longer and helping the police to tackle domestic violence”.On Wednesday, Starmer announced plans to release documents relating to Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador to the US, with exemptions for material that may affect national security and international relations.The government has previously blocked several attempts to use freedom of information laws to investigate Mandelson’s appointment and Palantir’s contracts. In June, Downing Street rejected a request from the fair tech campaign Foxglove to publish briefings to Starmer before his visit with Mandelson to a Palantir showroom in Washington DC, where they met the tech company’s chief executive, Alex Karp. Palantir signed a £241m deal with the MoD last month.View image in fullscreenAlex Karp. An FoI request to see briefings to Starmer before his meeting with the tech company’s chief executive were rejected.Photograph: Gian Ehrenzeller/EPAThe visit did not appear in the prime minister’sregister of visitsand Downing Street rejected an FoI request. In October, Downing Street responded to a similar request saying there were no briefings or minutes “as this was not a formal meeting”.A government spokesperson said: “Ministers engage with a range of companies as part of their international travel and Palantir is a longstanding investor in the UK.”Palantir: the world’s ‘scariest company’? – podcastRead moreIn July, the Foreign Office was asked by Democracy for Sale, an investigative newsletter, for information about Mandelson’s declaration of interest before his appointment as ambassador. It also wanted to see any official assessment of potential conflicts of interest. Again the government refused, on this occasion citing “prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs”.It admitted there could be “a strong public interest in understanding if any conflicts of interest may impede his work on behalf of [the government]”, but said release would undermine confidentiality which is supposed to encourage senior officials to “provide the fullest possible disclosure”. Starmer this week told parliament Mandelson “lied repeatedly to my team when asked about his relationship with Epstein, before and during his tenure as ambassador”.The information commissioner is now investigating the Foreign Office refusal as well as another refusal by the Department of Health and Social Care in June to release copies of official reports about Palantir’s NHS federated data platform. It withheld these documents on the grounds confidentiality was needed to allow the formulation of government policy.In December the MoD refused to release a partnership agreement signed by the defence secretary, John Healey, and Palantir’s Karp in London, which preceded last month’s £241m contract with Palantir. The MoD said a release could compromise the defence of the UK and prejudice the MoD’s ability to secure value for money from contractors.Wrigley said: “The lack of transparency in the deals with Palantir is concerning. It is essential that we have full transparency before any more back-room deals are struck. Palantir must prove its value in operational conditions, and that it isn’t just slick salesman’s promises.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsPalantirLabourPeter MandelsonPeter ThielZack PolanskinewsShareReuse this content"

In written submissions, ANL’s legal team said all the claims made in relation to Furnish and John were “groundless and unsupported by the evidence before the court”.It said the articles being challenged were sourced variously from journalists’ contacts, the couple’s spokesperson, statements issued by their office, freelance journalists, photographers, news agencies and previous articles.Furnish, who gave evidence to the high court via an occasionally faulty video link, said he initially assumed stories must have come from leaks. However, he said he was approached byhis friend, the actor Elizabeth Hurley, in February 2021 about allegations relating to the Mail’s use of unlawful tactics.“We are very grateful that Elizabeth called us,” he said in a written submission. “If she hadn’t, we wouldn’t know what had happened and would never have known that the law had been broken and our private home and private lives barged into, violated by the Mail.”Hurley told them of allegations that a private investigator, Gavin Burrows, had admitted intercepting and recording live telephone conversations at their Windsor home for the Mail on Sunday.However, ANL said Burrows had now stated that he was “never involved in any investigation work in relation to Elton John” and “never intercepted communications relating to … anyone else who had anything to do with Elton John”.John and Furnish are alleging voicemail interceptions and other unlawful information gathering techniques were used in 10 articles, published from 2000 to 2015. They also allege two separate episodes of unlawful information gathering, which did not lead to an article.The couple allege that one 2009 article about John cancelling tour dates because he was unwell was developed with unlawful access to John’s medical information. However, Catrin Evans, a barrister for ANL, said the information was taken from a medical statement from John’s “own website” and from statements made by their spokesperson.However, Furnish said they were concerned by the “specific detail” about his treatment in the article.The pair claimed another article from August 2015, about John being taken ill in Monaco, also contained private information. However, Evans said similar information had appeared in the French press.Evans suggested Furnish’s social circle would give information to journalists. Furnish said his friends knew not to share private information about his family. He said that while he may engage in “harmless chitchat”, he had mastered “the art of saying nothing” when confronted with journalists.ANL also said John’s former spokesperson and publicist, Gary Farrow, “regularly provided the media, including Associated journalists, with information about their lives”. It said that included health and medical-related information that the couple were now complaining about.It said the claimants’ researchers and legal team were simply trying to link records of payments to private investigators with articles “loosely proximate in time to the payment record”, which they claimed to believe contained “hallmarks” of unlawful activity.ANL’s legal team said this approach was “unsupported by any evidence before the court and utterly baseless”.The case continues.Explore more on these topicsDavid FurnishElton JohnDaily MailNational newspapersNewspapers & magazinesMedia businessNewspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

Any investment would depend on the mine supplying tin to the US, which considers the metal to be a critical mineral.Tin is used for soldering and is found in most electronic devices, as well as electric cars and solar panels. The metal is important for connecting semiconductor chips to circuit boards and its value has surged amid the boom in investment in datacentres that will power the AI industry.The metal’s price has risen sharply over the last decade, from $16,000 a tonne in 2016 to more than $50,000 at the start of this year.However, about two-thirds of the tin mined today comes from China, Myanmar and Indonesia, where there arelong-running concernsabout fragile supply chains and the use of child labour.Don Turvey, the chief executive of Cornish Metals, said the US interest was “a testament to the quality and strategic importance of South Crofty and its potential to become the first new tin producer in the western world”.Shares in Cornish Metals jumped nearly 7% on Thursday.South Croftyreceived a £28.6m investmentfrom the UK government in 2025 to support efforts to reopen it. Last summer, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, estimated the mine the could support 1,300 jobs in the wider region.Separately, a US-led critical minerals summit on Wednesday involving 50 countries produced a slew of agreements aimed at loosening China’s grip on more than 25 key elements, in their raw form and processed.The EU and the US announced joint intentions to work closer together, committing to a memorandum of understanding in the next 30 days. The two will also work with Japan on building additional supplies, after a separate US-Japan arrangement signed in October.The US state department said it had signed 11 bilateral deals on critical minerals at the summit, convened by the state secretary, Marco Rubio.Patrick Schröder, a senior research fellow at Chatham House’s Environment and Society Centre, said speeches by Rubio and the US vice-president, JD Vance, had made it clear the driving interest was that the US wanted to secure supplies for AI development.“Although they didn’t say it explicitly, it is still America first. It was framed as ‘America needs your help’. There was no mention of renewables,” Schröder said.Explore more on these topicsMiningCornwallUS foreign policyTrump administrationCommoditiesTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

The study sheds light on this, suggesting newborns can detect and predict patterns relating to rhythm, but not melody.Bianco said previous studies suggested macaque monkeys also showed a greater sensitivity to rhythmic patterns than melodic ones.“Rhythm seems to be built on very ancient auditory abilities that we share with other primates, while melody appears to depend on human brain specialisations that are shaped by learning after birth,” Bianco said.“In other words, rhythm may be part of our biological toolkit, while melody is something we grow into. This [may] help to explain why melodies vary so much across cultures, whereas rhythm tends to follow more universal patterns.”Writing in the journal PlosBiology, Bianco and her colleagues describe how they used electroencephalography (EEG) to collect brain activity data from sleeping newborns fitted with earphones.The babies were played, in random order, original pieces of music composed by Bach, as well as versions where pitches and note timings were shuffled.Bianco said the team used computer models to estimate how surprising each note in a piece was based on the preceding rhythmic or melodic structure of the music.They then analysed the EEG signals from 49 newborns to see if the surprises were reflected in their brain activity.The team found this was indeed the case for surprises in rhythm in the original pieces, suggesting babies can track and predict rhythmic patterns in real music. However, surprises in melody were not reflected in the brain activity.In addition, newborns’ brain activity did not reflect surprises in rhythm or melody in shuffled music.Bianco said: “Since the order of pitches and time intervals were randomised within a piece, the brain can’t extract regularities to build expectations upon.”Bianco said the findings suggested the human brain was biologically tuned to make predictions when listening to music, especially about rhythm.“Importantly, these predictions go beyond simply anticipating a regular interval: they involve detecting patterns in the music and learning how those patterns unfold over time,” she added.Bianco said such abilities in newborns probably had their roots in very basic biological and sensory experiences. “Before birth, the foetal environment is dominated by regular rhythms, such as the mother’s heartbeat and the repeated motion associated with her walking,” she said, noting such rhythms may provide the brain with an early sense of timing and predictability.Dr Giovanni Di Liberto of Trinity College Dublin, who was not involved in the work, praised the study but said it did not fully take into account whether mothers played music to their babies before they were born, although he said the study opened up the possibility of studying this.Bianco noted babies could hear music in the womb during the final trimester, adding that while melodies were distorted, rhythmic structure remained relatively intact.Prof Usha Goswami of the University of Cambridge said the study’s conclusions aligned with her own work with infants that suggested language acquisition began with speech rhythm.“Individual differences in children’s speech processing seem to depend on speech rhythm perception and not pitch structure perception, and this paper also proposes an evolutional perspective on this,” she said.Explore more on these topicsScienceChildrenBiologyPregnancynewsShareReuse this content"

The document charges Ford, 64, with aggravated rape of a child; raping a person suffering from a physical disability preventing resistance; two counts of molesting a juvenile; another three of indecent behavior with a minor; and kidnapping.Ford is only the latest figure to come under authorities’ scrutiny during the longstanding clergy molestation scandal within the New OrleansCatholic church. Prosecutors allege that he committed the offenses cited in the indictment between 2006 and 2008, victimizing a boy who was between the ages of 12 and 14.Arrest of priest for indecent behavior with a child reignites scandal in Louisiana dioceseRead moreHe would face mandatory life imprisonment if convicted as accused in the indictment, through which the office of theNew Orleansdistrict attorney, Jason Williams, filed formal charges against Ford in connection with his earlier arrest.Ford’s attorney, Ralph Whalen, did not immediately comment on Thursday.Court records generated by Ford’s arrest allege that he positioned himself as a mentor to the victim in the case while the boy grieved two family deaths. Ford then allegedly exploited that proximity to abuse the boy, whom he met through a church program for youth who are disabled.The name of that program was God’s SpecialChildren, and it was co-founded by Ford.As police tell it in a sworn statement filed in court, the boy was mourning his grandmother’s and father’s deaths when Ford – who was a Catholic priest from 1992 to 2007 – grew close to him, visited him at home to play video games with him and gave him guitar lessons.Then, police alleged, Ford began showing pornography to the boy, who is on the autism spectrum and has a degenerative spinal condition, which occasionally requires him to use a wheelchair. Ford allegedly ignored the boy’s pleas when the child expressed discomfort with the explicit content, eventually sexually attacked the boy on several occasions and told him his family would never believe him if he reported the abuse.Legally ruled to still be a minor despite having reached the age of majority, the victim came forward to police in November 2024, court documents say. He subsequently underwent two forensic interviews, and police obtained a warrant to arrest Ford in early September.Authorities arrested Ford in Portage, Indiana, where he was residing, later that month. He was transferred to New Orleans’ jail in October and ordered detained there without bail pending the outcome of the case.Williams’s office has previously said the case against Ford is “deeply serious and disturbing”.“He is accused of using his position to commit violent and reprehensible acts against a child with a disability,” a prior statement from Williams’s office said. “These allegations represent an unacceptable breach of trust and a level of vulnerability that should never be taken advantage of.”Ford is among several men who have worked as Catholic clergymen in New Orleans to have been arrested by authorities in connection with child sexual abuse allegations both before and after the city’s archdiocese filed for federal bankruptcy protection in 2020.Admitted child rapist and retired priest Lawrence Hecker dies aged 93Read moreThe archdiocese and its insurers in early December agreed to pay $305m collectively to settle with abuse survivors whose claims were ensnared in the bankruptcy case. Almost a year to the day before that agreement, the retired New Orleans Catholic priest Lawrence Hecker pleaded guilty to decades-old rape and kidnapping charges and received a mandatory life sentence. He died in prison at age 93 soon thereafter.Ford belonged to the Catholic religious order known as the Vincentians, and he was assigned to various churches within the archdiocese of New Orleans as well as the dioceses of Dallas and Gallup, New Mexico, during his clerical career. He helped found God’s Special Children while at New Orleans’ St Joseph church, which the Vincentians have run since 1858.The Vincentians sayFordeventually successfully asked the Vatican to remove him from the Catholic priesthood. An online profile of Ford said he worked for Louisiana’s government beginning in 2006 as assistant director of disability affairs, and later, in a separate role, aided efforts by the state’s Native tribes to recover from hurricanes.More recently, Ford was reported to have joined the US hunger relief non-profit Feeding America with positions in Phoenix and Chicago. And he was listed as a board member of the American Indian Center in Chicago.The church watchdog groupBishopAccountability.orghas previously said the 1994, 1999, 2002 and 2003 editions of the Official Catholic Directory failed to list Ford among active clergy members. Such disappearances can often signal “problems in ministry that are not being managed in a transparent way, and/or periods during which the priest has been sent to a treatment center”, the group said.Yet, as the website noted, only the earliest of those interruptions in ministry was publicly explained. The Dallas Morning News reported in 1997 that Ford had entered a program in New Mexico to be treated for problems managing money while working at two churches in Arizona for the Gallup diocese.In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visit their website for more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help.

The man, a former truck driver from the northern Italian region of Veneto, is the first suspect to be placed under investigation since the inquiry began in November.According to reports in theItalian press, he is alleged to have bragged about “conducting a manhunt”.Milan prosecutors investigate alleged ‘sniper tourism’ during Bosnian warRead moreMore than 10,000 people were killed in Sarajevo by shelling and sniper fire between 1992 and 1996 in the longest siege in modern history, afterBosnia and Herzegovinadeclared independence from Yugoslavia.The snipers were perhaps the most feared element of life under siege because they would pick off people on the streets, including children, at random. Sarajevo is in a basin surrounded by mountains, which made cutting it off and attacking it particularly easy.Groups of Italians and people of other nationalities, so-called “sniper tourists”, are alleged to have participated in the massacre after paying large sums of money to soldiers belonging to the army of Radovan Karadžić, the former Bosnian Serb leader who in 2016was found guilty of genocideand other crimes against humanity, to be transported to the hills surrounding Sarajevo so they could shoot at people for pleasure.The investigation inItalyoriginated from a legal complaint submitted by Ezio Gavazzeni, a Milan-based writer who gathered evidence on the allegations, as well as a report sent to the prosecutors by the former mayor of Sarajevo Benjamina Karić.Gavazzeni said he had first read reports about the alleged sniper tourists in the Italian press in the 1990s, but it was not until he watchedSarajevo Safari, a 2022 documentary by the Slovenian director Miran Zupanič, that he began to investigate further.In the documentary, a former Serbian soldier and a contractor said that groups of westerners would shoot at the civilian population from the hills around Sarajevo. The claims have been vehemently denied by Serbian war veterans.Speaking to the Guardian in November, Gavazzeni said the Italian suspects would meet in the northern city of Trieste and travel to Belgrade, from where the Bosnian Serb soldiers would accompany them to the hills of Sarajevo. “There was a traffic of war tourists who went to there to shoot people,” he said. “I call it an indifference towards evil.”Probably the most high-profile deaths by sniper fire were Bošco Brkić and Admira Ismić, a couple documented in the film Romeo and Juliet in Sarajevo, who were killed by a sniper in 1993 while trying to cross a bridge. Their bodies remained in no man’s land between the Bosnian and Bosnian Serb positions for several days. Photographs were published widely and became symbolic of the randomness and inhumanity of the war.Explore more on these topicsBosnia and HerzegovinaItalySerbiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The fourth-quarter earnings of the e-commerce and cloud-computing giant came in slightly below Wall Street estimates even as sales and growth surged.‘It’s an absolute bloodbath’: Washington Post lays off hundreds of workersRead moreAmazon will increase capital spending to $200bn this year from $125bn, CEO Andy Jassy said in a press release. Wall Street analysts were expecting spending to rise to roughly $147bn, according to FactSet.“With such strong demand for our existing offerings and seminal opportunities like AI, chips, robotics, and low earth orbit satellites, we expect to invest about $200 billion in capital expenditures across Amazon in 2026, and anticipate strong long-term return on invested capital,” Jassy said.Amazon’s investment is the latest sign that cloud-computing giants will not be hitting the brakes any time soon on hefty AI investments. Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet’s Google and Meta are expected to collectively spend more than $630bn this year.Revenue at Amazon rose 14% to $213.4bn in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, compared with $187.8bn in the year-ago period. The company reported net income of $21.2bn, or $1.95 per share, for the three-month period ending on 31 December. That compares with $20bn, or $1.86 per share, in the year-ago quarter.Mass layoffs fuel fears of ‘death spiral’ at Washington PostRead moreAnalysts had expected $1.97 per share on sales of $211.4bn, according to analysts polled by FactSet. Amazon reported the fastest growth in its prominent cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), in 13 quarters, with revenue increasing 24% to $35.6bn. Advertising revenue rose 22%, per a press release.Bezos, owner of the Post, is the executive chair of Amazon’s board of directors, a role he assumed in 2021 after founding Amazon in 1994 and serving as CEO for the better part of three decades. He purchased the Post for $250m in 2013. Amazon stock makes up the majority of his $235bn net worth, whichForbesestimated sank by $9bn, just 3.7%, after Amazon’s disappointing earnings.

Instead, it features an unlikely friendship between two animals whose blood runs red, white and blue: a bald eagle and a Clydesdale horse, the Budweiser icon. An adorable foal trots out of a barn, and the viewer is injected with a single minute of American iconography so pure that it would make Lee Greenwood nauseous.The horse meets a struggling baby bird who gets caught in the rain, prompting the horse to stand over the bird as a roof. The pair become pals and grow up together, the bird riding on the horse’s back as it grows larger. It falls off a few times, but, like George Washington at Valley Forge, it never gives up. Finally, the horse jumps over a log while the bird spreads its wings above, and we get a slow-motion image of something like Pegasus. We realize the bird, now fully grown, is a majestic bald eagle, taking to the sky as Lynyrd Skynyrd’s Free Bird reaches its climax. Two farmers look on while drinking Budweiser, as the words “Made of America” appear on the screen. “You crying?” one asks. “The sun’s in my eyes,” says the other.Budweiser are hoping it will cause a similarly teary reaction in viewers. They might be right: animals and nostalgia are key elements of a winning Super Bowl ad, according to ananalysis of 500 adsat the University of Virginia, andForbes’s Pamela N Danzigerexpects the Pegasus ad – officially titled American Icons – to be the Super Bowl’s most popular.The focus on a universally beloved phenomenon –unlikely animal friendships– comes after a Bud Light promotion in 2023 led to one of American history’sbiggest brand boycotts. Dylan Mulvaney, a social media star who is trans, talked up the beer in a 60-second video posted only to social media. Afterwards, rightwing personalities includingBen Shapiro,Ted CruzandMarjorie Taylor Greenelashed out; Kid Rockfired a gunat cans of Bud Light. In the four weeks ending on 3 June,sales of both Bud Light and Budweiserplummeted 24.6% and 9.2% respectively; to add insult to injury, Modelo, Bud Light’s Mexican rival, took over as America’s bestselling beer, with 8.4% of the US market share to Bud Light’s 7.3%. Within weeks, Budweiser returned to horse-forward, aggressively American marketing, releasing an ad featuring aClydesdale visiting the Lincoln Memorial.Since then, Budweiser’s Super Bowl commercials have stuck with the equine theme. A2024 spotalso plays the hits, with a dog-horse alliance and several hardworking white men in baseball caps.In 2025, a horse who understands beer’s symbolic value delivered a forgotten keg to hardworking white men in baseball caps.Women drinking beer clothed: why are rightwingers melting down over Miller Lite?Read moreThe Clydesdales are nothing new, of course; they’ve beenpart of the Super Bowl for decadesandassociated with Anheuser-Busch, Budweiser’s manufacturer, for even longer. But a look through recent Super Bowl adspre- and post-boycottdoes suggest a shift: a 2019 ad celebrates wind power, while ads from2021and2023, before the controversy, want us to know that diverse people from all walks of life love a Budweiser. Bud Light, meanwhile, followed the Mulvaney backlash with an adfeaturing a bunch of men grunting. One of them was Travis Kelce, and another NFL star, Peyton Manning, returns to advertise the brand forthis year’s Super Bowl. He’s joined by the comedian Shane Gillis, “who’s about the opposite of Dylan Mulvaney”, as Anson Frericks, a former Anheuser-Busch executive,told Fox Businesslast year. (Gilliscame to national attention in 2019after he was dropped from Saturday Night Live over racist remarks on a podcast.)As the US is torn apart, the year’s ad reads like a parody of patriotic imagery: the bird, the beer, the great American song that has become thebutt of classic-rock jokes. The mythical vision of America so many of us were raised on feels like a surreal relic in 2026.Perhaps it’s brilliant marketing: America’s hardcore fans can take it literally, while those dismayed at what’s happening all around us can take it as satire. And then we can all have a beer.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryAdvertisingSuper BowlBeerFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, Rio rejected Glencore’s merger approach in 2014, while another round of talks in 2024 also came to nothing.The most recent talks between Rio and Glencore resumed following the$53bn mergerof the London-listed miner Anglo American with its Canadian rival Teck in September, which combined two of the world’s largest copper producers.A Rio-Glencore merger would have created a global leader in metals including iron ore, copper, cobalt and lithium. The resources are critical in theproduction of technology products, including smartphones, at the centre of the boom in AI.Copper prices have been extremely volatile in recent days, at times recording all-time highs above $14,000 a tonne, as analysts predicted there could be a supply shortfall of as much as 10m tonnes by 2040.In December, Gary Nagle, Glencore’s chief executive, said the company’s aim was to become “the biggest copper producer in the world”. It is the world’s sixth-largest copper producer and the largest listed coal producer.Explore more on these topicsMiningRio TintoGlencoreMergers and acquisitionsCommoditiesnewsShareReuse this content"

If businesses and households were hoping for loans and mortgages to be a little cheaper this week, they were disappointed.Businesses need loans to invest in new equipment. Households need to remortgage to keep a roof over their heads. Both face a financial squeeze that might have eased if the MPC had more closely followed the evidence.That’s the view of Prof Alan Taylor, one of the nine members of the MPC, who said in a personal note attached to the Bank’s main monetary policy report that the weakening of the economy has been obvious for at least a year.Taylor shows his obvious frustration when he says there was little evidence of persistent inflation and “this supports my previous outlook”.In line with Taylor’s outlook, the latest health check on the economy from Threadneedle Street ditches previous concerns that the labour market has undergone a structural shift – one that has permanently improved the power of workers to demand higher wages.It says wage growth will moderate from 3.4% last year to 3.25% by the end of the year as inflation tumbles.On inflation, the Bank will no longer consider the UK to be an outlier, with food and services inflation declining to levels seen in other European countries.Inflation in the UKrose for the first time in five months to 3.4% in December, up from 3.2% in November.In a dramatic overhaul of its previous view, the monetary report says inflation is going to tumble by one percentage point by April compared with a forecast in November. That means the Bank will reach its target of 2% earlier than expected, falling into line with France, Germany and the EU average.Some of the reduction can be attributed to Rachel Reeves and last November’s budget. She cut energy bills and froze regulated rail fares. The Bank says Reeves can take credit for half of the post-November revision.However, it is the underlying trend that is important – and this is also weakening.The unemployment rate,which was 5.1% in December, will peak at 5.3%, the Bank said, above it previous estimate of 5% this year. The economy will expand by 0.9% this year rather than the estimate in November of 1.2%. Housing investment will be lower in 2026 and so will exports, the Bank’s experts believe.The Bank’s governor,Andrew Bailey, wielded the casting vote in a 5:4 split on the MPC in favour of holding rates, arguing that while he recognised the inflationary trend was weakening and there was a strong case for a cut in interest rates, he was minded to wait and see.As the chief waverer in the committee, he commands huge power. From his statements, it would appear that an interest rate cut at the next MPC meeting on 19 March is almost certain.For many it will be a long wait.Explore more on these topicsInterest ratesMonetary policy committeeAndrew BaileyEconomic policyEconomicsBank of EnglandInflationanalysisShareReuse this content"

Frozen (2013)Pathetic fallacy is the literary device in which the environment reflects a character’s mood. It is central to Disney’s animated classic, which is about a woman who gets so annoyed that she literally turns her surroundings into a perpetual winter. As such, she is responsible for untold miseries, not least the fact that her stroppiness directly caused the invention of Josh Gad’s annoying snowman.19. The Shining (1980)Perhaps the defining movie on seasonal affective disorder. In The Shining, Jack Nicholson’s family suffer as he succumbs to the madness of snowbound isolation. Although the interior scenes are what really give the film its terrifying reputation, it’s worth remembering that none of the events would occur if the Overlook Hotel was easy to escape. Also a timely reminder that snow really takes the fun out of mazes.18. Blade Runner (1982)Ridley Scott’s classic is a masterpiece of design, with its rain-drenched futuristic cityscapes playing as much of a role as any of the actual characters. Does the constant rain affect the plot? No, not really, although you’d have to imagine that everyone would be a lot less grimly miserable if the sun came out now and again.17. Force Majeure (2014)View image in fullscreenThe life-changing avalanche in Force Majeure.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyRemade in 2020 as Downhill, Ruben Östlund’s Force Majeure is more about how people react to perceived weather than the weather itself. It follows the repercussions for a man who, upon believing that an avalanche is about to hit, abandons his family and runs away. Everything is immediately undone, and what follows is excruciatingly hard to watch.16. The Thing (1982)Ultimately weather isn’t the first thing you think about when you think about The Thing, because that would be the thing itself in all its nightmarishly grotesque glory. However, try to imagine the film in a lovely springtime meadow and it instantly loses all its power. Its Antarctic setting means that all the characters are isolated and visibility is constantly low. This is what makes the film such a claustrophobic classic.15. Hard Rain (1998)A notorious flop upon release, Hard Rain is a film where a criminal gang attempts to conduct a heist, only to be outdone by – you guessed it – some pretty hard rain. The film tries so hard to be serious that it eventually becomes enjoyably silly, although Morgan Freeman is miscast as a baddie and Minnie Driver complained that she wasn’t allowed to wear a wetsuit because the producers wanted her nipples to be visible.14. Everest (2015)Although it has now essentially become a theme park for the rich and reckless, it’s important to remember that multiple people die on Mount Everest every year. Everest – an all-star Poseidon Adventure-style ensemble piece – tells the story of a real life disaster that befell climbers in 1996, when eight were caught in a blizzard and died during their descent. The film does a good job of showing how unsurvivable conditions are there. Indeed, just five months before the film was released, 22 people were killed when the mountain was struck by an avalanche.13. Take Shelter (2011)Few partnerships in film are as satisfying as the one between Jeff Nichols and Michael Shannon. Take Shelter is a perfect example. Shannon plays a man plagued with visions of terrible storms. Are they premonitions or is he mentally ill? It’s a premise that allows both parties to work to their strengths; Shannon is tortured and haunting, and the amount of psychological tension that the writer-director Nichols can wring from the story is astonishing.12. Into the Wild (2007)Sean Penn’s retelling of the story of Christopher McCandless, a young man who ventured unprepared into Alaska, has long inspired a small army of copyists, many of whom end up having to be rescued. Which makes you wonder what film they were watching, since Into the Wild is a tale of a man showing up unprepared for all manner of storms, floods and ice. It’s beautifully done, but probably better to just stay at home.11. The Impossible (2012)Those who remember the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami will long be haunted by the news footage of its aftermath, with bodies piled up outside hospitals. The Impossible is a dramatisation of that event. And while not universally well received upon release – it was just eight years after the disaster, and since its stars were Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts, some accused it of whitewashing what really happened – it remains a profoundly upsetting watch.10. The Revenant (2015)View image in fullscreenLeonardo DiCaprio in his Oscar-winning performance.Photograph: APBack in 2015, Leonardo DiCaprio was so desperate for an Oscar that he ended up subjecting himself to The Revenant, a film where an endless litany of awful things happen to his character. And while it does get a bit slapstick at times – occasionally veering into Mr Bean cosplay territory – he does end up being relentlessly clobbered by the weather. There are storms. There is rain. It gets so cold that his beard freezes. It is all tremendously unpleasant but it did the job, proving that nothing gets you an Oscar faster than a bit of inclement weather.9. Twister (1996)Twister – and to a lesser extent its recent sequel Twisters – speaks to a deeply American fascination with storms. Where other films paint tornadoes as things to hide from at all costs, Twister turns them into a spectacle. All the characters here are determined to chase them no matter what, whooping and hollering as they go. It respects the severity of storms, which demolish houses and vehicles, but is such a mid-90s blockbuster that only bad guys and side characters die. It is a good tornado movie, but is it the best tornado movie? No, and that’s thanks to …8. Sharknado (2013)Because, while Twister is fun, it has to lose points for the tornadoes not being stuffed to the gills with legions of murderous sharks. This is not an accusation you can level at Sharknado, which is explicitly a film about a tornado stuffed with murderous sharks. Made on the cheap, in order to maximise on the ridiculous trend for knock-off creature features that began with Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus, Sharknado is deliberately extremely preposterous from start to finish. While it deserves to be watched, the same probably cannot be said about all its sequels, especially the one starring Jedward.7. Magnolia (1999)Paul Thomas Anderson’s film is the director’s attempt to process his father’s death, but it is so ambitious and sprawling that it essentially ends up being about everything. This includes freak weather events. The film’s emotional climax comes in the form of millions of frogs falling from the sky. At first it is absurd. Then, as the frogs hammer down, breaking windows and causing car crashes, it becomes terrifying, then upsetting, then awe-inspiring. It is also much more of a logistical nightmare than many of the films in this list, since it is much harder to mop up a citywide ankle-deep deluge of frogs than it is some snow.6. The Day After Tomorrow (2004)It would be astonishingly easy to fill this entire list with films made by Roland Emmerich, a man who has dedicated his entire career to making films where loads of people get punished by incredibly crap weather. However, The Day After Tomorrow is perhaps the best microcosm of his oeuvre. There’s a hailstorm. There’s a hurricane. There’s wind and rain. There’s the sudden appearance of a new ice age. There’s a pack of loose wolves, which isn’t traditionally meteorological but deserves mention. It is Emmerich’s climate crisis movie; a grand warning that, unless we change our ways, we’re going to either freeze to death or get eaten by wolves.5. The Poseidon Adventure (1972)Fair warning: from this point onwards, the list starts to skew heavily towards people having a rubbish time on a boat. And with this in mind, it would be wrong to ignore the ur-text of people having a rubbish time on a boat. A film about a luxury cruise liner being undone by a tsunami, it features a murderer’s row of performers, including Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Carol Lynley and Roddy McDowall. The disaster movie that other disaster movies aspire to be, it was the highest-grossing movie of 1973 and won two Oscars. Bit weird to describe a film about mass death as an adventure, though.4. Noah (2014)View image in fullscreenNoah.Photograph: Paramount /Sportsphoto/AllstarDarren Aronofsky has made a career of depicting terrible things happening to people, so it stands to reason that he would eventually make a film about an incredibly terrible thing that happened to everyone at once. Noah, his retelling of the story of Noah’s Ark, is his highest-grossing film to date, but also possibly his least well remembered. Did you know Ray Winstone is in it? Did you know Emma Watson is in it? Did you know that several countries banned it on religious grounds? Either way, you have to agree that it is a film about some absolutely dreadful weather.3. The Mist (2007)This will be contentious because, when it comes to films about droplets of water that are suspended in air, some people get absolutely furious. In one corner there are fans of John Carpenter’s The Fog (about some spooky things hiding in some fog), and in the other are fans of Frank Darabont’s The Mist (about some spooky things hiding in some mist). There is only room for one of these on this list and, for me, The Mist just about edges it. This is partly because it’s based on a Stephen King novel, and partly because it has one of the most hilariously overwrought endings of any film in history. I welcome your emails.2. The Perfect Storm (2000)You know a film has hit a nerve when it becomes part of the lexicon. We live in an age where almost everything is described as a perfect storm, and it’s all because of this film: a story of some fishermen off the Massachusetts coast who found themselves tragically caught up in a nightmarish combination of high pressure, a cold front and a hurricane. It’s a good film, with strong performances by George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg, but the knowledge that this really happened (in 1991) makes it all the more heartbreaking.1. All Is Lost (2013)What a thing of beauty this is. The only actor in All Is Lost isRobert Redford, and only 51 words are spoken aloud in the entire film. All Is Lost is the story of a sailor who realises that there is a hole in his boat, with a storm approaching. The boat flips. He’s thrown overboard. He gets in a raft. There’s another storm. Things do not altogether go great. It might just be Redford’s best film, his face gradually transforming into a gritty monument of stoicism as he quietly accepts his fate. It might not be a perfect storm, but it’s a perfect film.Explore more on these topicsRankedRobert RedfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They wanted to record their debut album, 2023’s I’ve Seen a Way, in a Peak District cave known as the Devil’s Arse, although budget restrictions meant they had to settle for one day in Somerset’s Wookey Hole caverns. The Manchester/Berlin-based four-piece’s new album, Urgh, was written in what they’ve called “an intense residency at an eerie studio house” near Leeds; at the time, singer Valentine Caulfield and drummer Alex Macdougall were both undergoing multiple rounds of surgery. Given the industrial, siren-like intensity of their music, in which Caulfield chants about personal and societal horrors in her native French, impounding themselves in such a place might have seemed unnecessarily masochistic.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for UrghMandy, Indiana seem to feel a moral imperative to embrace extremes. Caulfield has often reiterated her (accurate) stance that “if you’re not angry, then you’re not paying attention”; her incantatory lyrics to new song Dodecahedron indict complacency in the face of a burning world. Given the grievous state of things, the band’s short-circuiting assault may hold about as much appeal for some listeners as sticking your fingers in a live socket – but for those inclined to catharsis, they also fully understand the imperative to push beyond merely observing injustice to viscerally embody its head-spinning force. Otherwise, what’s the point?That instinct places them alongside Model/Actriz, YHWH Nailgun, Moin, Kim Gordon and Gilla Band, the latter arguably the forebears of all this. (The band’s Daniel Fox mixed Mandy, Indiana’s debut and co-produced Urgh.) Each of these acts has disassembled rock down to its mechanical bones, Frankenstein-ing it with the DNA of techno and trap to make it seem shockingly new. In this grimy, purgative company, where everyone is mutating in a different enough direction for each act to remain compelling, Mandy, Indiana’s distinctiveness comes from their limber rhythms. Powered by Macdougall’s incredible versatility and Caulfield’s staccato delivery, many of their songs are alive with an addictively free, bodily lope, which is often stalled by squalling winds and thrashing noise: threat lurking around every corner.Mandy, Indiana: Sicko! ft Billy Woods – videoUrgh, their first album for Sacred Bones, has a few obvious differences from their debut: Cursive’s percussive churn redirects into rudimentary electro appealingly reminiscent of Paul Hardcastle’s 19, and US rapper and kindred spirit Billy Woods adds guest verses to Sicko!, sounding typically unruffled as the track lurches queasily between gargled fuzz and pointillist artillery fire. But the main evolution is into a harder, thicker sound, a contrast of extreme physicality and hyper-detailing that feels like getting dragged under by a strong wave and marvelling at the flotsam caught up in its swell.It’s impressively hard to tell where guitarist Scott Fair ends and synth player Simon Catling begins. Magazine’s ferocious peak hits like a pile-driver that pauses to recharge only to renew its obliterating attack, while Macdougall’s drumming evokes shuddering glass jars one minute, booming Japanese taiko drums the next. Standout Ist Halt So (the shrugging German phrase meaning “that’s just how it is”) seems to pack about four different movements into as many minutes – taunting, staticky, howling, blizzard-like chill – and has a Nine Inch Nails-worthy way with making the mechanical sleazy and earwormy, to disgusting, brilliant ends.Gilla Band on their nightmarish new noise album: ‘Reality gets distorted in a dream’Read moreCaulfield has said that she enjoys that most listeners don’t understand her lyrics; that non-Francophones’ conception of the language as beautiful means she can, as on early single Nike of Samothrace, sneak in lines about stabbing rapists. “I’m trying to pass my intentions to you in the way that I perform and in the way that I use those words, and let’s see if you can get some of it,” she has said. Whatever your Duolingo level, there’s no mistaking the impression of someone feeling trapped amid the smashed mirror sounds and ricocheting percussion of Try Saying, a song about wishing for a life of ease. A Brighter Tomorrow weds a slow siren to a heavy slither of bass, creating a suffocating effect even before you realise Caulfield, at a disembodied remove, appears to be singing about a faltering real-time effort to process sexual assault.For the final song, I’ll Ask Her, Caulfield sings in English for the first time, evidently intent on being heard as widely as possible: “They’re all fucking crazy, man,” she repeats in a frenzy, between convincingly parroting the way men casually dismiss sexual assault allegations against their mates. Laced with dogs barking, incredible splintered sound design and an angle grinder’s unrelenting moan, it overheats until it sounds like a panic attack.#MeToo is vanishing in culture’s rear window, and in turn songs explicitly confronting rape culture have become less headline-grabbing. You think ofDominique Pelicotand former Conservative councillorPhilip Young– who spent years drugging and raping their wives – and of every scumbag with an Epstein island stamp in their passport, of the bros watching each other’s backs closer to home, and remember that it feels extremely good to hear someone raging about this like the emergency it still is.This week Laura listened toRolling BlackoutsCoastal Fever – Sunburned in LondonLove, disconnection and the shadow of colonialism weave around each other in the Melbourne band’s return, the beauty of it being how lightly they weigh those subjects amid a perfect slice of Aussie indie.Explore more on these topicsMusicExperimental musicIndiereviewsShareReuse this content"

So here goes …The Smashing MachineView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Everett/ShutterstockIt was Safdie versus Safdie this past autumn with the directing duo splitting to do their own thing even if their own thing ended up being kind of loosely the same. The brothers both picked to make a sports biopic just not in the way many of us traditionally expect – A24-released, focused on a figure many of us don’t know, more vibes than arc-led – and it seemed like Benny might have the more obvious awards play with The Smashing Machine. He had a Hollywood heavyweight in Dwayne Johnson doing the serious transformative thing the Academy have long loved, he had Oscar nomineeEmily Bluntin support and a big Venice film festival premiere complete with a 15-minute standing ovation and a leading man in tears. But the film was a little too inside baseball, not just for the public (it staggered to a puny $21m global gross) but for critics and voters who brushed it aside for Josh’s still unconventional but far more grabby Marty Supreme. Johnson will return in Jumanji 3.The Smashing Machine reviewAfter the HuntView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Amazon Content Services LLC/PAAfter both Challengers and Queer failed to seduce enough of the Academy, it seemed like director Luca Guadagnino would be on safer ground with After the Hunt, an older-skewing, campus-set drama about a #MeToo fallout. Weinstein reportage drama She Said might not have set the Oscars alight but this one was led by Oscar-winning American sweetheart Julia Roberts, supported by Oscar nomineeAndrew Garfieldand The Bear’s awards magnet Ayo Edebiri. It also had a Venice premiere, and with its provocative subject matter there was an expectation of impassioned debate on the ground. Sadly the main question being asked was less how could she/he? and more huh? The film dropped out of the race almost immediately, an equally unimpressed audience greeting its New York film festival premiere before audiences showed zero interest in getting involved (the $80m production couldn’t even make it to $10m worldwide). Roberts might have scored a Golden Globe nod but her Oscar chances were dead in the water and Guadagnino remains out in the cold for the Academy.After the Hunt reviewA House of DynamiteView image in fullscreenPhotograph: NetflixIf the majority of reactions from Venice were to be believed,Kathryn Bigelowhad another slam-dunk on her hands with clammy nuclear weapon thriller A House of Dynamite. It was showered with praise and seemed like Netflix’s surest awards play given the director’s history with the Academy, winning an Oscar for The Hurt Locker before Zero Dark Thirty received five nods. But then it landed at the New York film festival with a thud, a notorious press screening that led to laughs and groans and suddenly its chances started to fade. It eventually had a similar reaction on Netflix, baffling those who bothered to watch the whole thing, and the streamer’s overall campaign strategy started to de-prioritise the film which deservedly ended up with zero nominations.A House of Dynamite reviewDeliver Mefrom NowhereView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Macall Polay/PAThis should have been one of the easier wins of the season – or at least nominations. A Bruce Springsteen biopic made by a director who previously led an actor to a win (Jeff Bridges for Crazy Heart) starring someone with a history of impressing awards bodies (The Bear’s Jeremy Allen White) released the year after another drama about an older musician was a critical and commercial success (A Complete Unknown) pushed by the same studio (Disney) and launched at a prestige festival (Telluride). So how did Deliver Me from Nowhere fail? The film, later given the panicked IP-aware retitle of Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere received polite reviews upon its premiere, polite enough to suggest White would be in the race but it fell fast, never giving fans enough of what they wanted (it made a shocking $22m in the US, over $50m less than the Dylan biopic) while also failing to transcend well-known formula. In a year that saw initial best actor predictions revised right after the fall festivals, this was one of the more surprising misses.Deliver Me from Nowhere reviewChristyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Eddy Chen/Black BearIn the overly schematic strategy of Sydney Sweeney’s career, a film like Christy made perfect sense. The Euphoria breakout had graduated to small, well-reviewed proof-of-talent drama Reality to glossy romcom Anyone But You to final girl horror Immaculate and inevitably, an awards play was next. Christy managed to tick a number of go-to boxes – true story, de-glammed transformation, boxing – and after a fall festival premiere was set, at the more commercially leaning Toronto, and with a best actress category that was, at that stage, lacking in surefire contenders, it seemed like a win for Sweeney (and after that American Eagle ad, she really needed one). Some initially, over-excitedly, labeled her a contender but the film was a box office disaster, one for the history books, and with some middling reviews, she couldn’t even score a nod at the more celeb-thirsty Golden Globes. As the best actress race became more competitive, she become a distant outsider.Christy reviewJay KellyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: BFA/AlamyWhile The Squid and the Whale might have scored Noah Baumbach an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay, the writer-director did not make for an obvious Academy darling. His following films Margot and the Wedding and Greenberg, which found him at his most sour, pushed him even further away and it took his most personal film, and arguably his best, Marriage Story, to suddenly turn him into a real Oscar favourite. The film was nominated for six, winning one for Laura Dern, and while White Noise might have landed with a thud, Baumbach was nominated once again for his Barbie screenplay with Greta Gerwig. Jay Kelly, with a starry cast led by George Clooney, film industry plotline and splashy Venice premiere, seemed like it could help Baumbach get his first Oscar and maybe Adam Sandler his first. But reviews were mixed with some more scalding (the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw opted forone star) and the Clooney comeback narrative folded, a film of old-fashioned American sentimentality that failed to impress the new, more international Academy.Jay Kelly reviewWicked: For GoodView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Universal Pictures/APWhile Wicked might not have swept the board last year in the way that many ardent fans had hoped, the coulda-gone-either-way big bet was still a major contender, nabbing two wins and another eight nominations. It was naturally assumed that the follow-up, released a year after, would do the same and even after reviews were less enthused, downgraded expectations still had experts predictingAriana Grandewould secure her second best supporting actress nod in a row along with recognition in a ton of craft categories. But the film was entirely shut out, a staggeringly precipitous fall that had some questioning whether releasing the films so close together was such a great idea after all (the sequel was also down $250m on the original’s global box office). It was in some ways reassuring, voters refusing to automatically, and lazily, put a lesser sequel on the ballot just because (there was also a 22% drop on Rotten Tomatoes), allowing for some less by-the-book picks instead.Wicked: For Good reviewThe Ballad of a Small PlayerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: APNo one quite saw Edward Berger’s All Quiet on the Western Front coming. The third adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel was given a quiet Toronto premiere from Netflix in 2022 and in its awards campaigning that year, the film was de-prioritised in favour of The Good Nurse, White Noise and Blonde. But it slowly became their safest bet with 14 Bafta noms and nine at the Oscars (it ended up winning four). Berger became an in-demand director and all eyes were on his adaptation of Robert Harris’s papal thriller Conclave. But again no one expected that to be the force it ended up becoming, making $128m globally and garnering eight Oscar noms (it won one for best adapted screenplay). Could he make it three for three with The Ballad of a Small Player? Despite everything in place – Oscar nominee Colin Farrell, Oscar winnerTilda Swinton, Telluride premiere – the film just didn’t connect – too flashy, too loud, too messy – and almost immediately became a low priority for Netflix and voting bodies.The Ballad of a Small Player reviewIs This Thing On?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Searchlight Pictures/PAWhenBradley Cooperfirst broke out, even his most supportive family members could not have predicted that the guy who mostly played jockish dudebros would become a 12-time Oscar-nominated actor-writer-producer-director. His directorial debut A Star Is Born was a $436m-grossing award-winning smash and even if his follow-up Maestro didn’t find as many fans, it still received seven Oscar nods and it seemed like whatever he went on to make would automatically be in the conversation. Except no one ended up saying much about his smaller-scale third film, divorce comedy drama Is This Thing On? which premiered at the New York film festival and couldn’t make enough noise at a time when the race was seeming to firm up. It was lost within the fall festival circuit before it was lost within the December stampede of qualifying releases, another tough break for Searchlight, which couldn’t find love for this, The Testament of Ann Lee or …Is This Thing On? reviewRental FamilyView image in fullscreenRental FamilyPhotograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyThe Brendan Fraser comeback narrative was powerful enough in 2023 to score the actor his first Oscar for a film that was otherwise deemed a bit of a disaster. The Whale, a film the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw generouslycalled“vapid, hammy and stagey”, gave Fraser an Academy-friendly transformation and his off-screen story was persuasive enough, although his inevitable Oscar-primed follow-up couldn’t quite make the distance. Rental Family, which premiered at Toronto, was a more obviously feelgood story and actually scored better reviews than The Whale, but in a best actor category that was becoming increasingly competitive, Fraser – like Clooney, Johnson, White and Farrell – was another well-known name who didn’t feel like an indispensable part of the race.Rental Family reviewExplore more on these topicsOscarsOscars 2026George ClooneyDwayne JohnsonJulia RobertsNoah BaumbachEmily BluntfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s an austerely challenging reading and incidentally, right about now, nothing could be further from the richly empathetic and redemptive approach ofChloé Zhao’s Hamnet, about the play’s imagined origins.The setting is modern London’s world of shady family business and family dysfunction, wedding parties, blandly scheming associates and SUVs speeding through the night-time streets. Hamlet looks here like no one as much as Kendall Roy from TV’s Succession.Riz Ahmedplays the prince, horrified by a ghostly vision of his dead father (Avijit Dutt) who, in a chilling scene, summons him to a bleak urban rooftop to announce he was murdered by his brother Claudius (Art Malik). Claudius now is a hard-faced property speculator who has evicted a tented community of people led by Fortinbras from some prime real estate, and who now intends to marry Hamlet’s mother, Gertrude (Sheeba Chaddha).Hamlet retreats into shocked, enraged indecision and a kind of confrontational madness intended to embarrass the wrongdoers while exempting him from actual punitive action; it creates a growing miasma of authentic tension. Timothy Spall is the ingratiating, menacing Polonius, whose murder is brutally explicit and violent, and deliberate in a way it isn’t in the original.Morfydd Clarkis Polonius’s daughter Ophelia, now deeply hurt at her former suitor Hamlet’s sudden and fanatical coldness to her, and Joe Alwyn is her brother Laertes.Ahmed carries the production with his performance of someone convulsed with weakness and self-hate. This film loses most of the soliloquies (including “Alas, poor Yorick” and the skull), which traditionally get the audience on Hamlet’s side, though “To be, or not to be” stays;Hamletvirtually screams it at the wheel of his car. Ophelia’s importance to Hamlet is fractionally increased by rerouting some of Hamlet’s dialogue with Horatio to her, although we lose Ophelia’s mad scene, which is a misjudgment, I think.Overall, this is an intelligent and focused account and one which, at least at first, allows you to ask the question: what if Claudius, however unscrupulous and predatory, is in fact innocent of murder? What if the ghost and his accusation is Hamlet’s hallucinatory delusion, a psychosexual projection of his own disgust? There’s a rigorous chill to this Hamlet.Hamlet is out on 6 February in the UK and on 10 April in the US.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsWilliam ShakespeareHamletRiz AhmedTimothy SpallMorfydd ClarkreviewsShareReuse this content"

Andrea Arnold’s 2011 film was criticised for its grit and gloom while Emerald Fennell’s new version, which arrives in cinemas on Valentine’s Day, was described as “aggressively provocative” after test screenings. Perhaps now is the time to return to the source material. In the audioverse, there have already been readings by Michael Kitchener, Daniel Massey, Juliet Stevenson, Patricia Routledge and Joanne Froggatt, though I favour this 2020 edition narrated by Aimee Lou Wood, of Sex Education and The White Lotus fame.Set in Yorkshire, Emily Brontë’s tempestuous novel opens with Mr Lockwood, the new tenant at Thrushcross Grange, visiting his sullen landlord, Heathcliff, at his remote farmhouse where he gets snowed in. Bedding down for the night, he stumbles upon the diaries of the late Catherine Earnshaw, who writes of her love for Heathcliff, an orphan brought by her father to live with the family. Later Mr Lockwood has a nightmare in which the ghost of Catherine begs to be let in through the window (a scene immortalised in song by Kate Bush). The following day he returns to Thrushcross Grange where he asks the housekeeper, Nellie, to tell him about the Earnshaws. Nellie shares a dark tale of abuse, revenge and doomed love.Wood breathes fresh life into this tempestuous novel, capturing Nellie’s gossipy tone and the early wildness of Catherine and Heathcliff. As circumstances pull these once inseparable youngsters apart, that wild abandon curdles into desolation and discord that is carried down the generations.Available via Penguin Audio, 13hr 58minFurther listeningSimply MoreCynthia Erivo, Macmillan, 3hr 43 minThe singer, actor and star of Wicked tells of her path to stardom and shares tips on how to stay focused on your goals in a book that is part memoir, part empowerment manual.

Yet it’s good to find his interpretation wasn’t set in stone.

There are touches of playfulness too – when in a couple of the variations he switches to a higher octave, the music sounds like it’s on helium, lighter than air. The slow variation halfway through is deeply felt, the long 25thvariation touchingly done without quite staring into the abyss in the way that some performances do. It will be interesting to hear how Lim’s interpretation of the Goldbergs develops over the years, but this is a fine account to start with.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

However, it is an intimate, and sometimes moving, family portrait as well as a social history of race, class and aspiration in late 20th‑century Britain.The opening chapters, with their ubiquitous skinheads and “Run, Paki, run” taunts, contain the book’s most arresting scenes. Racism is continuous and targeted: from graffiti on his father’s shop windows to the everyday humiliations at school, and on the buses where his father had bravely fought an informal colour bar to become a bus driver.Javid doesn’t shy away from showing the cruelty of 1970s and 80s Britain for brown and black kids. White neighbours and co‑workers help the family inhabit the same space as racists, and the book makes it clear that the system is hostile even when individuals can be kind.The Colour of Home is an affecting study of Javid’s parents, particularly his indefatigable mother. Her illiteracy sits in counterpoint to her fierce commitment to her sons’ education: spotless uniforms, regimented homework and trips to Rochdale Library. Javid’s father is shown as a man of energy but limited luck: a bus driver who repeatedly launches small clothing businesses that almost always fail.School is a site of trauma. Javid does not airbrush the brutality of playground racism – from the boy trying to “rub the black off” his own arm with sandpaper, to Javid’s shame‑soaked rejection of a black classmate in order to fit in.Alongside these scenes is the story of intellectual ignition: the tutor who continues to teach him for free, the pink pages of the Financial Times abandoned on a bus, the sense that reading could be a reliable means of escape.Javid is not a natural writer; the prose is a bit “Jack and Jill”, and it could have done with a sharp edit. It is at its best when it occupies a Dickensian domestic precariousness, the presence of bailiffs, the stock that never sells, the children in trouble. These short, vivid chapters – “Dettol and determination”, “Britain’s most dangerous street” – carry a clear narrative. The memoir’s argument about meritocracy is more nuanced than Javid’s political slogans ever were.Racist rhetoric and policy have become defining features of mainstream British politicsPolitically, the memoir compels because it refuses to tidy away contradiction. Javid’s father moves from scepticism about Margaret Thatcher to voting for her, even as his own life is crushed between property developers, debt and deregulated markets. Javid is clearly inspired by his father to rise through the Conservatives, but this sits disturbingly next to the book’s record of racism.In fact, reading his story in the context of the past decade of Tory rule illustrates how his party exploited the narratives of children like him while entrenching policies that brutalised people who look like his parents. For instance, when he was home secretary in 2019, Javid shamefully revoked Shamima Begum’s British citizenship shortly after she was discovered in a Syrian refugee camp. Begum had been trafficked to Syria as a 15-year-old in 2015.Similarly, his successor Priti Patel’s posture as a child of immigrants “taking back control” functioned as political cover for policies that coerced people into destitution. The “hostile environment” approach to immigration enforcement, initiated by Theresa May, but a persistent feature of Home Office culture after her departure, fostered racist practices and contributed directly to the Windrush scandal, in which black Britons were detained and threatened with removal from a country they had the full legal right to call home. Javid later claimed hedidn’t likethe term “hostile environment”, but nevertheless defended and maintained the structures that perpetuated it.Suella Braverman’s stint as home secretary took this fusion of identity politics and punitive policy even further, marrying the image of a British Asian woman in one of the great offices of state to apocalyptic language about “invasions” of small‑boat arrivals. Her speeches repeatedly framed a “law‑abiding patriotic majority” against desperate people crossing the Channel. In both cases, the presence of non‑white women at the top of the Home Office did not soften the edge of Conservative immigration policy; it helped insulate a hardening border regime from charges of racism while it continued to inflict racialised harm. And while Javid might not have been a member of the government by then, he remained a member of the party for which these were official positions.Racist rhetoric and policy have now become defining features of mainstream British politics. Recent reporting about Nigel Farage’stime at Dulwich Collegeunderlines how little distance there is between the corridors of elite education, racist language and political success. Taken together with The Colour of Home’s scenes of playground racism, these testimonies show continuity rather than rupture: the same casual dehumanisation of Jews, black people and Asians.In this context, its portrait of a boy learning to survive and outthink that environment – and his insistence that education, solidarity and institutional self‑scrutiny are the only real antidotes – feels less like a nostalgic political origin story and more like an urgent warning about the Britain that comes next. Javid, cheerfully now in the “Big House”, can at times sound like an Uncle Tom: his narrative minimises structural barriers and suggests minorities simply need to work harder in order to succeed.His decision to concentrate on his early years and write little about his rise through the Tory party represents a serious omission. Surely he has much to tell about the inner workings of the now imploded Conservatives. But perhaps he’s saving that for another volume. It would be fun to read if he can be as honest about that as he is about his childhood.The Colour of Home: Growing Up in 1970s Britain by Sajid Javid is published by Abacus (£25).

And the aim on their part, of course, is always to beguile, and often to deceive.And yet the temptation is sometimes too great to resist.Mark Haddon, whose blistering memoir details a mainly miserable and loveless childhood and an adulthood studded with significant hurdles, hit the literary jackpot with The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time in 2003. In it, a teenage protagonist who struggles to communicate with the world around him uncovers a world of lying adults – most egregiously, he has been told his mother has died, rather than absconded with the nextdoor neighbour – and runs away from home. A more recent novel, The Porpoise, opens with a fatal air crash before morphing into a reworking of Pericles; in Leaving Home, we discover that Haddon is terrified of flying. We also learn that he borrowed heavily from childhood holidays in Brighton to create the atmosphere and texture for his story The Pier Falls, a merciless, documentary-style narration of a cataclysmic seaside disaster.It’s not a stretch, then, to note that the raw material of his upbringing is vitally important; specifically, a near-total absence of love or affection, his mother’s apparent withdrawal – to bed, or to drink – from family life, a continual thrum of undermining. What’s more fascinating is to consider the variety of modes he uses to achieve a kind of creative elasticity. Haddon’s work moves between strikingly plain reportage, as if to say “this happened”, and flights of fancy and fantasy, often rooted in classical mythology with its possibilities of shape-shifting and other mutations. As this memoir makes clear on almost every single page, he is as much interested in images as words; there are hundreds of illustrations, from the wincingly explicit photographs of his elderly mother’s open foot wound or the scars of his own heart bypass surgery, to his puckish collages and phantasmagorical paintings and sculptures. His work, whether verbal or visual, is a reclamation yard. In one crude cartoon, a rugby-playing father rebukes his weeping son with the words “I have sired a weakling child”. Beneath runs the son’s riposte: “But he will draw pictures of you when you are DEAD HAHAHAHA HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA.”The question remains: can you recover from – or even avenge – an unhappy childhood by dismantling and remaking it differently in adulthood? In one demonstrable sense, yes: not only has Haddon made a life in literature, he has his own family, and a strong and continuing bond with his sister, Fiona. But alongside the evident joy he finds in acts of creation, in personal relationships and in activities such as running, there is damage that the book suggests he needs to examine and catalogue, to somehow fix in place.‘To say I was the favourite would imply I was liked’: Mark Haddon on a loveless childhoodRead moreHe does not gloss over it. Early on, the reader comes face to face with a photograph of a newly sutured arm; above it, a doodle of a dog, with bleeding forepaw, and the caption “And what, precisely, is this going to solve?” Two matter-of-fact paragraphs opposite describe Haddon’s visit to A&E: he cut himself deliberately, but “accidentally” chose a new scalpel “instead of the scissors I might normally use” and went too deep. He cuts when he is “uncontrollably angry” with himself; calm returns quickly, leaving him “embarrassed” (an emotion that recurs frequently) and “apologetic” to the hospital staff who care for him. Perhaps the most shocking thing for the reader is that this particular event happened in 2024; there is no statute of limitations on feeling desperate.What, then, to do with the nostalgia – the sense of longing for the sights, sounds, smells and artefacts of the 1970s – that grips and confuses him? One answer is to put those thoughts and feelings into a work like this – an incredibly detailed, painful, funny, horrifying and exhilarating record of how to live beside what has happened.Leaving Home: A Memoir in Full Colour by Mark Haddon is published by Chatto & Windus (£25).

It doesn’t quite cover it. Often regarded as his finest, Arcadia is about life, the universe and everything, to borrow a phrase.It takes place in a single room, across time, alternately filled with a 19th-century past and a parallel setting in the 1980s. Director Carrie Cracknell suggests these worlds are a hair’s-breadth away from an encounter, virtually brushing past each other as they go. It opens with teenage prodigy Thomasina Coverly (Isis Hainsworth) conversing amicably with her tutor Septimus Hodge (Seamus Dillane). The ping-pong of their dialogue is amusing but heartfelt. The mysteries of the world that Thomasina seeks to solve through algebraic equation are accompanied by a slow flirtation between them and the romance that grows is tender, sparky and moving.Their scenes are set beside academics in the play’s present-day, hunting for Thomasina’s lost story and a strand involving the roguish Romantic Lord Byron, as well as the estate’s unknown 19th-century hermit.View image in fullscreenEveryone here is so clever … Holly Godliman, William Lawlor and Angus Cooper.Photograph: Manuel HarlanStoppard, in the same interview, spoke about the sense of a detective story at play in Arcadia and Cracknell’s production carries a lovely searching quality so it seems like a twist on the country-house drama with cerebral intrigues and intellectual piques – even if the story builds towards a conclusion that never arrives.There is an off-stage garden that insinuates itself in the room and the off-stage figure of Byron too, never seen but often referred to in connection with a stinking literary review, a duel and subsequent disappearance.Alex Eales’ elegant set turns the single room into a galaxy with overhanging planetary ellipses and oversized atoms. Staged with a barely perceptible revolve, its movement seems to mimic the turning of the Earth in miniature. Characters discuss thermodynamics, Euclidian geometry, poetry versus science, the algebra of a leaf, and so on. These ideas glimmer like conceptual holograms, wavering before you, just out of reach. Actors bring even the most arcane lines to life with a spirit of playful romance between them.This is a drama about knowledge, and hermeneutics, in which some of its science feels just beyond your understanding. Rather than raising frustration, the unknown languages of Newtonian physics and mathematics gleam with the sense of a playwright tossing about complex ideas with such excitement, dexterity and depth that it doesn’t matter whether you understand them.Joe Wright on Tom Stoppard: ‘He loved sweets, smoking, words and women – in the reverse order’Read moreOr up to a point, at least. Everyone here is so clever, from the winningly precocious Thomasina to Stoppard himself that it can make your head hurt with its abstraction, intelligence and cerebral intensity.The present-day scenario is weaker in its drama and more glib by contrast. “This is not science, this is storytelling,” says Septimus, but it does not always feel that way in these scenes. They stall the pace of the play, which stands still as characters talk out ideas on scholarship. There is not the same tender chemistry in the modern world of academic jousting and flirtation either, despite (or maybe because of) the crass passes made by bombastic scholar Bernard Nightingale (Prasanna Puwanarajah) on star academic Hannah Jarvis (Leila Farzad). Worse are his jokey put downs: “silly bitch” and “silly cow”.This aside, the production has an inbuilt exuberance and is invigoratingly realised. It’s like a complicated piece of algebra, exquisite in its difficulties, unsolvable to the end.At theOld Vic, London, until 21 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageTom StoppardTheatreOld Vic TheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Whitney White’s gig-theatre quartet isn’t so much exploding Shakespeare as needling at it. The writer-composer-performer has a love for these plays and their musicality, but she also wants to ask difficult questions about them. Who’s allowed to take up space in these works? Who gets to perform in them? And why do so many of the ugly things in these plays continue to speak to us today?To grapple with these ideas, White takes on four of Shakespeare’s characters: Lady Macbeth, Emilia from Othello, Juliet, and Richard III. As a Black woman, she questions which parts of the canon are open to her, trying out a series of the playwright’s women before claiming one of his male leads. She is joined in her storytelling by a glorious, shape-shifting chorus of witches (Renée Lamb, Georgina Onuorah and Timmika Ramsay), a white male performer (Daniel Krikler) who is the ever-present “he” to her “she”, and a white female foil (Juliette Crosbie) representing the sorts of actors who will for ever be Juliets.View image in fullscreenRefrain tonight… Whitney White in All Is But FantasyPhotograph: Marc BrennerThe show takes some time to hit its stride. White begins by stepping into the boots of Lady Macbeth, a role offering plenty of swagger. She reframes the character as a woman pursuing her only path to power, before finding that power alone isn’t enough. But it’s in the second part, Emilia, that White’s creation gets real teeth. Here, female solidarity and white allyship are unpicked, and we’re challenged to consider the cost of reproducing violence against women on stage.In Juliet, White reluctantly takes on a role that has never felt like hers, while simultaneously questioning the version of youth, innocence and star-crossed love that Romeo and Juliet has bequeathed to contemporary culture. And finally, fed up with all these women who suffer and die, White decides to play one of the most villainous of Shakespeare’s men: Richard III. But is shrugging on the mantle of masculinity really a solution?‘To me, Lady Macbeth sounds like Tina Turner’: the musical mashup about to rock the RSCRead moreThe riffing on these texts sometimes threatens to become repetitive, circling around similar questions. But it’s a performance that also problematises itself, with the interrupting voices of the other performers adding complexity. And then there’s the music, bringing texture and passion to what could be a dry intellectual exercise. Each character or play has its musical signature – rock for Lady Macbeth, blues for Emilia – with refrains and echoes across the four parts, all brilliantly performed by the ensemble and the onstage band.White’s most compelling intervention is to turn the idea of “timelessness” on its head. We’re used to hearing that Shakespeare’s work transcends its time, but what does that say about our time? Or why – as White puts it – are we still lapping up stories of sexy men killing sexy women? Those looking for answers might be frustrated. But White leaves her audience sitting with the discomfort – perhaps to carry with us the next time we see one of these plays.AtThe Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon,until 21 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreRoyal Shakespeare CompanyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Forced together by the death of their mother, they each have a child’s neediness. They are divided, however, over what – or whom – it is they need.What Teresa, the eldest, needs is respect for her devotion, especially as the primary carer in their mother’s final days of dementia. Played by Victoria Brazier, austere and brittle, she is trapped in a narrative of martyrdom, a woman forever convinced she is second-best and overlooked.As the baby of the family, 33-year-old Catherine is in permanent need of coddling. Played by Helen Flanagan, babbling and self-absorbed, she is hungry for reassurance – about her looks, her health and her desirability.Then in the middle, and at the play’s centre, 39-year-old Mary needs to be understood. Played by Polly Lister, wise and yet vulnerable, she is the clever high-flyer, the one who became a doctor, receiving admiration, yearning for love.View image in fullscreenHaunting the family home … Vicky Binns as Vi.Photograph: Pamela RaithThese unrequited desires are focused on the same woman and Stephenson has the good sense to bring her back to life. Played by Vicky Binns, Vi haunts the family home with needs of her own, not least the need to be valued by her daughters. In a play about memory, she has quite a different account of the past from their self-justifying childhood tales.Like the patient in Mary’s care, a young man rebuilding his history after suffering post-traumatic amnesia, the daughters have constructed their memories in a way that suits them. The play is not sentimental about Vi’s death – it is too blackly funny for that – but it does show that, in her absence, with none of the old grievances to fall back on, the sisters must now endure the pain of redefining themselves.These themes keep The Memory of Water from sinking into sitcom blandness, a bulwark to resist the pull of low-stakes character comedy. But even if the play is more cosy than explosive, lacking a big dramatic moment around which the ideas could coalesce, in Lotte Wakeham’s well-acted production, a collaboration with the Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse, the to and fro of emotions has a reflective, bittersweet appeal.AtOctagon, Bolton, until 21 February; thenEveryman, Liverpool, 25 February to 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

There is one at the centre of this play, too, about the power struggle and culture clash in a mixed Cypriot-British family after its patriarch dies.In 2009, in Nicosia, Aristeia (Lucy Christofi Christy) insists her late brother be buried in the Cypriot mountains, in a practice that goes back generations. But his British wife, Jennifer (Ruth Lass), demands her late husband’s body be taken to England, as was his dying wish, she claims. So Aristeia’s keen sense of sacred tradition is pitted against Jennifer’s arguments on freedom from a cultural rite that her husband did not value. Both attempt to reel in the younger generation: Jennifer’s daughter, Penelope (Han-Roze Adonis), and Aristeia’s niece, Xenya (Chrisanthi Livadiotis).The backdrop features a more public sacrilege – the interred body of the former president, Tassos Papadopoulos, has been stolen, we hear. The legacy of British colonial rule also hovers between the warring women.It has the makings of a highly charged drama, with echoes of Antigone and a face-off between Jennifer and Aristeia as the last will and testament is read out. But it does not quite work out that way. De Voni’s debut play has ambition and weaves big, original ideas together around our ownership of the dead and the intersection of belonging, culture and the land. But you do not feel the force of these ideas, and the characters are flimsily built. Some are barely there, such as Jennifer’s second husband, Dominic (Sam Cox), who is little more than a vehicle of the plot.Meanwhile, Penelope carries echoes of Odysseus’s patient wife, left behind for his adventures. She feels her own sense of parental abandonment and it slowly becomes her story, along with that of her mother’s responsibility and guilt, but you never feel as much for her, or any of the characters, as you should.The Rat Trap review – teenage Noël Coward’s jaundiced marital portraitRead moreDirected by Kerry Kyriacos Michael on Cory Shipp’s stark traverse stage set, some scenes are effective, particularly the clashes between mother and daughter, and Jennifer and Dominic’s discussions about love, death and togetherness. And there are some deftly written scenes, full of complicated emotion, but the actors do not quite do them justice.Soupy musical interventions do not help, bluntly dictating mood changes to give the drama the sound of a TV melodrama. Where this play excels is in the smooth tying of the ancient and modern. It is a shame it feels so static and ponderous, too much a discussion of ideas. At over two hours, the play’s promise and potency are ultimately dragged down by its pace.AtTheatro Technis, London, until 22 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

You must know them. Melania” and “Does Melania wear Prada? Find out on Friday!”Writing on the cinema’sInstagram, Jordan Perry said: “Got a call that the higher ups (ie, at Amazon) were upset with how our marquee marketed their movie (ie, Melania), that, per them, Sunday would be its last day here.”Melania debuts at No 29 at the UK box officeRead morePerry added that he hoped Amazon wouldn’t cancel his Prime membership and directed devoted Amazon fans to “show your support at Whole Foods instead”. The cinema owner also addressed those who had criticised his decision to show the film in the first place.In a post titledWhy I, Jordan, Got Melania Here,”Perry wrote that his overriding instinct was that the programming “would be funny”. There was also a financial imperative, he added: “The film marketplace this week and next were a desert … So, to fill a screen, why not get this inexplicable vanity piece from the current president’s wife? I mean, it just seems so weird that it even exists (who wants a movie about Melania lol?), and wouldn’t it then be exponentially weirder, to the point of being funny, to show it here, at your obviously anti-establishment, occasionally troublemaking, neighbourhood cinema?”Amazon’s cancellation of the film in theOregoncinema comes as some in the US have flagged the incongruity of healthy ticket sales and apparently empty cinemas.The film took $7m (£5.1m) over its opening weekend domestically and opened at No 3 in the US box office charts.The Daily Beastreports that there have been accusations of “fake tickets sales” to boost the box office totals.View image in fullscreenA man puts up a poster for the screening of Melania, in Ljubljana, the capital of the first lady’s native Slovenia, the film’s best peforming international territory.Photograph: Darko Bandić/APCiting theSubstackof industry pundit Tom Brueggemann, the article claims: “Industry sources say there were signs that blocks of tickets were purchased for the weekend, then distributed to senior citizen homes, Republican activitists, other interested parties for free to help boost audiences.”Meanwhile Puck reporterMatthew Belloni saidAmazon and cinema chains AMC and Regal told him that they “did not experience unusual block purchases of tickets” for the film, while adding “the theatre chains might not necessarily know, of course”.One adult for the 9.40am in Sittingbourne: a front row seat for Melania’s ominous UK openingRead moreExit reports from weekend screenings in the US suggested that “older white women” were the demographic most responsible for propelling it to success.In the UK, where Melania opened across 155 screens, takings were considerably softer. The filmopened at No 29in the UK charts, for a weekend screen average of £212.The US takings for the film currently account for some 98.8% of its box office total, from a 30% share of the screen total (some 1,500 of the total 5,000 cinemas). At present, Melania’s native Slovenia proving the best-performing international territory. Overall, the film opened in 26 countries globally last Friday, after the South African release was abruptly cancelled the day before, with local distributors citing “the current climate” and “recent developments”.In the UK, some industry insiders questioned whether the unusually wide rollout of the film could be an indication of “four-walling”: the release strategy by which distributors pay cinemas to screen the movie.Explore more on these topicsMelaniaMelania TrumpOregonFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

But what she’d really like to get her teeth into is a certain dino franchiseThu 5 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTShareStacy Martin is “not a religious person”. Still, the actor insists things have happened in her life that have made her realise there’s “a whole expanse of things that are unexplainable”. Once, at home in north London, she noticed a lightbulb flickering. She couldn’t solve the mystery: no matter how many times she changed it, the bulb continued to blink. Instead of consulting the internet, Martin went to see her psychic, a tea leaf reader she meets annually, booking in under a fake name.The psychic suggested that someone was trying to communicate with her. “I was like: ‘What if I just start talking to this person that apparently wants to talk to me?’” says Martin. “And so I did. And that light never flickered again.” Martin prefers not to use the word ghost, but she’s aware there are things the mind can’t make sense of; things the body somehow knows.In her new film, The Testament of Ann Lee, her body is a vessel for the divine. Mona Fastvold’s wild movie musical tells the story of the 18th-century religious leader and mother of four who swore off sex with her husband but gave her body over to God. Ann Lee (Amanda Seyfried), founder of the Shakers, expresses devotion through song and dance, writhing, trembling and shaking her way to deliverance. Martin plays a key part as Jane “Mother Jane” Wardley, leader of the Shaking Quakers and the woman “who showed Ann Lee who she could become”, says Martin.Co-written with Fastvold’s partner Brady Corbet (director of The Brutalist), scored by the Oscar-winning experimental musician Daniel Blumberg and featuring hypnotic, ecstatic choreography by Celia Rowlson-Hall, the film is unlike anything I’ve ever seen.No one would ever think of me in a musical. I like the idea of transgressing expectationsSince her breakout role in Lars von Trier’s Nymphomaniacin 2013, Martin has worked with arthouse provocateurs including Michel Hazanavicius, Ben Wheatley and, on three different occasions, Corbet. On screen, the half-French, half-British actor and model appears coolly intelligent and, sometimes, a little stern. “No one would ever think of me to be in a musical,” says Martin, “and so I like this idea of transgressing expectations.”Barefaced and wrapped in a fuzzy grey jumper, she is video calling from the study of her home in Beachwood Canyon, Los Angeles, which has the appearance of an oak-panelled library. “A lot of my books are still in London,” says Martin, who is now living between the two cities, and has been contemplating whether she should simply buy all her books twice. “Is that outrageous?” she asks, eyebrows furrowing. “I think it is.”Martin is quick-witted with a surprising, dry sense of humour. Lately, she has been reading “this great David Lynch biography” and getting into quantum physics. “Some of my dear friends love it and I have no idea what the hell they’re talking about, so I’m trying to wrap my head around it.”When she was researching the Shakers, Martin found little information about Mother Jane, except for “what she says to Ann Lee about not having relations with her husband”. Today, the Shakers are best known for the integrity of their minimalist wooden furniture. But the dwindling Protestant sect are also notorious for their celibacy, with just three remaining members alive today. Martin was amused by the seeming contradiction between her character’s chaste marriage and her passionate spiritual reveries. “For the movement to be so visceral, and about catharsis, and worshipping … I was just quite surprised that she decided not to have sex with her husband,” she says with a chuckle. But Martin was interested in the idea of abstinence as a potent form of power. At that time, she says, “it probably made sense for women, because it was the only way they could really gain status”. The Shakers believed in gender equality and so by removing desire, “it wasn’t about women and men being part of a hierarchy that I think sex will always shape”.She was also curious about the shaking. She was mesmerised by the “tender violence” of Rowlson-Hall’s expressive, instinctive choreography. Learning the film’s dance sequences over a two-week rehearsal period was “like summer camp”, she says. “Not that I’ve ever been to summer camp.”Martin first met Fastvold in 2015, in “freezing Budapest” on the set of Corbet’s debut film, The Childhood of a Leader. The married couple direct their own films but write together, working with a recurring cast of collaborators. “In French, it’s atroupe,” Martin says, slipping into a perfect accent. “T-R-O-U-P-E, that sense of working with the same people, in a space where you’re being pushed because they all know you so well.” Fastvold and Corbet’s troupe includes Martin, Blumberg (Martin’s ex-partner of 14 years), who scored The Testament of Ann Lee as well as The Brutalist, Rowlson-Hall (who also choreographed Natalie Portman in Corbet’s Vox Lux) and the actor Christopher Abbott, who plays Ann Lee’s despicable husband and has appeared in all of their films.Fastvold and Corbet are “very in symbiosis”, says Martin. “They’re both committed to writing a story that is bigger than them, that also feels very close to their heart.” In The Testament of Ann Lee, Martin reckons Fastvold is exploring her own relationship to motherhood. “Not just in terms of having children, but creating a space for people to thrive, and for artists to come together and be greater than what society’s told them.” A natural matriarch and “force of nature” on set, Fastvold has also spent the last decade as a kind of mother figure to Martin. “She met me when I was a baby! I’ve been in all their films, I’ve lived with them, they’ve lived with me. I’ve seen their daughter grow up,” says Martin. “She understands that sometimes there isn’t a solution, we just need a rant. That is an incredible friend to have.”The Brutalist was arguably the surprise critical darling of last year’s awards season and went on to win three Oscars. Martin says the film’s success felt like an affirmation “of all the decisions and instincts I’ve had about film-makers”. The actor has, by her own admission, actively pursued a career in independent cinema. After Nymphomaniac, “making sure I worked with artists and I worked on films that were director-led, that was a big thing for me”, she says.At the Oscars they give you alcohol under your seat – I think it was tequila. It’s useful, because it is quite longIt was a particularly special moment, then, when at the end of The Brutalist’s long awards campaign, Martin attended the Oscars with Fastvold and Corbet. “They give you alcohol under your seat – I think it was tequila,” she says, deadpan. “It’s useful to keep people’s spirits up, because it is quite long.” The spectacle of the ceremony was a little strange, she says, but entertaining to witness. “I just thought: You’ll probably never go back, so make the most of it,” she says.Over email, Fastvold describes Martin as “a true cinephile” with “an instinctive understanding of the larger vision of a film”. Martin is a regular at east London’s Close-Up, a tiny cinema and lending library just off Brick Lane, and a collector of DVDs. “There was an amazing guy in Stoke Newington,” she says, who used to run The Film Shop, a video and DVD rental shop specialising in world cinema. “It was all from the Criterion Collection and Second Run. I’d go there and take a film from a director I knew and then he would recommend another film. It was so great,” she says wistfully. “The ritual of it, I really loved.” When it closed, she was so devastated she ended up buying half the shop. “I was like: ‘What are you gonna do with all these films?!’”The Testament of Ann Lee review – strikingly strange portrait of radically ecstatic Shaker leaderRead moreLast year, impatient between projects, Martin wrote and directed her first short film. “I didn’t realise, as an actor, just how shielded you are from the whole experience.” Being behind the camera, she says, “was like an on-set experience on steroids”. One of her next films, The Queen of Fashion, about avant garde fashion editor Isabella Blow, will see her step into designer Daphne Guinness’s hoof-shaped platform shoes. When Blow died, Guinness bought almost all of her clothes. Guinness lent her archive to the production. “We had original McQueen pieces, we had Philip Treacy’s lobster hat, we had original Marc Jacobs pieces that still had soup on them,” she remembers.“I don’t want to do the same thing over and over again,” Martin says. Over the summer, she shot a studio adaptation of Sense and Sensibility, in which she plays formidable Jane Austen villain Fanny Dashwood. She says she hasn’t steered away from Hollywood blockbusters, but that “they just never came to me”. Now having carved out an enviable career in indies, the mainstream is firmly in her sights. Still only 35, she is “trying to manifest being in the next Jurassic Park”.

Its arrival at Greenland’s largest outpost was newsworthy enough to merit a large picture in the local newspaper.The clipping, published in 1861, comes from the pages of the Atuagagdliutt, a Kalaallisut-language weekly that was the first in the world to use colour illustrations.The image of early US interest in Greenland forms part of a newly opened exhibition on 19th-century Arctic exploration at the University of Toronto’s Thomas Fisher rare book library.Arctic Fever, which draws together lithographs, books, maps and ephemera, offers some uncanny parallels to today’s scramble for the north, showcasing the ambition, hubris and hunger for territory and resources that still drive much interest in the region.View image in fullscreenEskimaux Chart No 2, with “shaded parts drawn by Iligliuk at Winter Island, 1822”, from William Edward Parry’s Journal of a Second Voyage for the Discovery of a North-West Passage From the Atlantic to the Pacific, 1824.Photograph: Thomas Fisher rare book library“A lot of people see the news and are confused by president Donald Trump’s desires for Greenland. He’d said it in his first term. He voiced it last year,” said Isabelle Gapp, an art historian at the University of Aberdeen, and co-curator of the exhibition. “But people often don’t quite understand just how long a history the US has with Greenland.”The view held by senior officials in the current White House was also held in 1867, when secretary of state William Seward formalized a desire to acquire Greenland and Iceland, citing the two islands’ immense strategic value.Donald Trump has said he would not take Greenland by force, but the White House suggests that it remains keen to control the island. Jeff Landry, the US special envoy to Greenland, called it“one of the world’s most strategically consequential regions” in a recent New York Times op-ed, and called American dominance in theArctica “non-negotiable” reality.View image in fullscreenFirst Communication with the Natives of Prince Regents Bay, as Drawn by John Sackheouse and Presented to Capt Ross, Aug 10, 1818, from John Ross’s A Voyage of Discovery, 1819.Photograph: Thomas Fisher rare book library“It’s lucky for us – in a kind of nasty way – that politics would make this collection so resonant. But I’m hopeful it gives us a chance to think about more than just politics,” said the exhibition’s other curator, Mark Cheetham, an art historian at the University of Toronto. “It’s also the place where the themes of environment and migration and resource extraction are so dominant. We’re hoping though to be able to give the public a fuller view of a place that has long been the source of obsessions.”Few regions of the world have captured the public imagination as the Arctic, buoyed in part by accounts of successful expeditions –and the horrors associated with failure. The exhibition’s title comes from the 19th-century US adventurer Walter Wellman, who wrote: “The arctic fever is in our blood, and there is no cure for such patients but to put them on ice.”By focusing their collection during the zenith of exploration in the region, the team at the library are hoping to reshape how people understand the human presence in a vast, culturally and geographically diverse region of the planet.“We tried to push against the narrative that this was a barren, inhospitable wasteland. Wilderness implies a space in which there is kind of nothingness, that one is travelling to a place where no one has been before. But this is obviously untrue when you look at the people who have long lived there,” Gapp said. “But even today, there’s a narrative that is a place where this man overcomes nature. And this idea very much comes from the 19th century.”Grant Hurley, a librarian who helped acquire many of the works, said the collection showed the evolution of how nations slowly changed their views of the north.“For European and American explorers, the Arctic was once thought of as a place to be transited successfully. It was simply a place to pass through,” he said. “Once that was accomplished, it then became a place to colonize and claim as your own territory.”But for Indigenous peoples, the lands and waters were long a place to live, hunt, travel and explore. Threaded through the exhibit is a recognition that they understood how to thrive on the region’s land and waters – and attempted to share that knowledge with outsiders.View image in fullscreenMartin Engelbrecht’s Whaling at Spitsbergen, circa 1760, lined up with depth as it would have been viewed in a wooden peepshow case, without the front proscenium.Photograph: Thomas Fisher rare book libraryThe British explorer William Parry spent a winter learning from Inuit in the 1820s when his search for the fabled Northwest Passage was foiled by ice. Parry grew enamoured with an Inuk woman called Iligliuk, who displayed a “superiority of understanding for which she was so remarkably distinguished”.Early attempts to have locals sketch maps of the region “did not produce any very satisfactory information”, Parry wrote in his journal. But soon the British began to “appreciate the geographical knowledge which they possessed”.Iligliuk’s ability to translate her knowledge of the land into something sailors could use was both accurate and detailed. Her skills were called “astounding” by the English geographer John Barrow, who was serving as the second secretary of the admiralty.Iligliuk’s maps reflected generations of interaction with the environment. Instead of a compass, she was guided by winds, the movement of ice and the contours of the land. She identified spots where caribou were plentiful and where one could rest, displaying a very different relationship with the region than the one envisioned by European and American explorers.“What strikes me over and over again is how militarized the Arctic has been [since] the first excursions in the 1500s. Parry wanted to find the Northwest Passage. Why? Because it was an economic and military advantage,” Cheetham said. “Iligliuk’s views reflected a wholly different measure of time and space.”While none of his items are present, the curators admit that Sir John Franklin, the famed explorer, is the “ghost” of the exhibition. His 1845 expedition in search of the Northwest Passage ended in disaster, with all 129 crew members succumbing to the hostile elements.From 1847 to 1859, at least 36 expeditions set out in search of Franklin’s lost ships. All ended in failure, but produced both an unprecedented stream of detailed studies of the region. The collection also includes other, more human artefacts from the search, including elaborate playbills printed on silk commemorating the theatrical showcases put on as entertainment during the long winter nights. One such performance, aboard the HMS Assistance in 1851, promised a “grand farcical, tragical, melo-dramatical, serio-comic” play, with a “lady … engaged at an enormous sacrifice, it being her first appearance on any stage” – a nod to the extensive catalogue of costumes brought along for the voyage.Inuit oral historian who pointed way to Franklin shipwrecks dies aged 58Read moreIt wasn’t untilresearchers turned to Inuit oral historythat they were able to locate the final resting place of the Erebus and the Terror in the past decade.Climate change has battered swaths of the Arctic and will inflict further damage to delicate ecosystems. As permafrost thaws and ice melts, the rush to extract immense resource wealth is only beginning. Nations andIndigenous peoples are bracing once morefor a feverish push into the region.“As the focus intensifies once more on the Arctic, it’s important to remember there isn’t one history, there are many histories. People have long moved in all directions, from all places. They have traveled and they have lived there,” Gapp said. “The history of the Arctic is long, rich, varied, and so too is its future. Where we are today is just another brief moment in its history.”Explore more on these topicsGreenlandHistoryExplorationCanadaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Of course I didn’t, because she’s braver than me. She asked me.”However the decision to cast Robbie in the role of Cathy has led to much scepticism and scrutiny ahead of the film’s release, specifically for its departure from the original 1847 novel byEmily Brontë.View image in fullscreenJacob Elordi in Wuthering Heights.Photograph: Photo Courtesy Warner Bros. PicturesRobbie, 35, will play Catherine Earnshaw who is written to be in her late teens in the original novel. The casting ofJacob Elordias Heathcliff has also been criticised. In the book, the character is described by Brontë to be of “Gypsy” and “Lascar” (South Asian) descent, which accounts for the prejudice against the him in the book.However Fennell defended her decision. “I can’t adapt the book as it is but I can approximate the way it made me feel,” she said.The casting director Kharmel Cochrane also defended the choice at the Sands film festival in Scotland last summer, saying that “there’s no need to be accurate” and it’s “just a book”.Robbie co-founded the production company LuckyChap Entertainment in 2014 with her husband, Tom Ackerley, as well as producers Josey McNamara, and Sophia Kerr. The company produced Fennell’s previous two films, Saltburn and Promising Young Woman.The adaptation of Wuthering Heights will premiere on 5 February in London’s Leicester Square and will be released in cinemas in the UK on 13 February for Valentine’s weekend.View image in fullscreen‘She’s braver than me’ … Margot Robbie in Wuthering Heights.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyThe film first premiered in Los Angeles on 28 January, withcritics calling it“intoxicating, transcendent, tantalising, bewitching, lust worthy, hypnotic” – although full reviews are embargoed until 8 February.Fennell’s directorial style has been characterised by her daring, provocative and at times indulgent social commentary. Speaking about how this style will continue in her latest feature she said: “Wuthering Heights needs to provoke a sort of primal response.”The director also spoke about the background behind the set design in the film, revealing that the wallpaper in Cathy’s bedroom was inspired by images of Robbie’s skin.“We asked her to send us all her veins and her freckles, and then we printed it on silk and stuffed it and put latex over it so that it could sweat,” she said. “At first glance, you don’t see any of it, it’s just a beautiful pink room.”“It’s like a visual example of what it feels like to be made a wife, to be made an object of beauty, to be a collector’s item.”Other unconventional behind the scenes activity involved shrines Fennell made of Elordi and Robbie as a way to mimic the infatuation their respective characters have with one another in the film. “I was like: ‘I’m going to go through the internet, I’m going to find their best photos and then I’m going to make shrines in their bedrooms for each other,’” she saidView image in fullscreen‘I can’t adapt the book as it is but I can approximate the way it made me feel’ … Emerald Fennell speaks at BFI Southbank.Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images for Warner Bros.“So when Jacob went into his room, he had an insane shrine to worship not just Cathy, butMargot Robbieand then she had the same thing. There’s nothing more humanising than somebody’s first press photo.”Fennell also spoke about the process of getting Charli xcx onboard to create the soundtrack for the film: “I sent Charli the script. Even though she was in the middle of the brat tour, the most busy person in the entire world, she read it immediately.”“She called me and said: ‘What do you want?’ I said: ‘Well, a song would be nice.’ And she said: ‘How about an album?’ And I was like: ‘Yeah, cool.’”“It’s so dorky, but it is my favourite album I’ve ever, ever heard in my life.

But while this can provide time to think, it is fraught with emotional complexitiesEmily RetterThu 5 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 5 Feb 2026 06.48 ESTShareWhen her mum called her, stress would ring through Marie’s body like an alarm going off. So “I stopped answering the phone,” she says. She forms the words purposefully, as if reading from a script. This was one of the “boundaries” she discussed carefully with her therapist three years ago when she reached a point of crisis in managing her maternal relationship.She has never explained her decision to her mother, but it followed a lifetime of what Marie, who is in her 40s, feels has been rejection, shaming and feeling like the “black sheep of the family”.Marie’s mother, she says, would always make everything about herself. “Everything I did was just … everybody has it worse. You know, I’d say, ‘I don’t feel very well’ and she’d reply: ‘Yes, well, I’ve got diabetes.’ I was scared to have a voice.”One day, Marie phoned her mum and told her she had received a diagnosis of autism. She was met with a dismissive “hmm”. “My therapist said to me: you can’t control their behaviour, but you can control what you allow in and how it affects you.”So as well as stopping answering the phone, she decided that she, her husband and her children would no longer visit her mother, who lives a few hours away. She will also only call her mum when she has a clear purpose; to check on a grandparent, or reveal necessary news. “I call when I need to,” she says. “If I told her something personal, she would tell everybody in the family … there was no emotional security.” And if her mother complains? Marie reverts to that script again. “I don’t even apologise,” she says. “I say, ‘Oh, I’ve just been busy. How are you?’ And deflect.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Daria Lada/The GuardianIn the world of family estrangement, the approach Marie is describing is known as “low contact” or LC. While complex to navigate, it avoids the absolute cutting all ties of “no contact” (NC) – a subject that has been widely discussed thanks to the very public approach adopted byBrooklyn Beckhamtowards his parents – and between princesHarry and William. TikTok is awash with users proclaiming the benefits of no contact. The 400,000 posts on the topic include lines such as “Take back your power!” and “No contact is self-respect”.But Marie did not want no contact. “The love I have for my mother will always be there,” she says. She wanted to ensure her children were able to see their grandmother and didn’t want to risk severing ties with her wider family. For her, low contact is “easier to live with” than none, with “less guilt”. And while the relationship has not dramatically improved, Marie feels the door has opened slightly for a potential conversation in the future.Georgina, who is in her 30s, has also gone low contact. “The whole household when we were growing up was about not upsetting my mum,” she says, adding that she often felt like the subject of her mother’s “volatility”. Finally, a family fallout prompted her to choose “very low” contact with her parents and siblings.View image in fullscreenEstranged … the Prince of Wales and Prince Harry.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesBut like Marie, she wants her children to have a relationship with her parents and siblings and their children – and for her kids to build their own relationships with their cousins. Her mother looks after her grandchildren once a week and returns them home, but Georgina keeps the conversation short. When her siblings are nearby, she meets them so the children can see each other. “It is very child-focused,” Georgina says.Georgina never told her mother she was reducing contact. “My mum came to my door after I hadn’t spoken to her for weeks and she said some awful things,” she says. It was difficult to remain firm, but she agreed to contact with the grandchildren – enough to make her mother “feel OK”.Katherine Cavallo, a family and couples psychotherapist withmore than 25 years’ clinical experience, often works with clients experiencing family estrangement. She says low or no contact has become more prevalent in recent years, which some figures back up. A recentYouGov pollfound that 38% of American adults are estranged from a family member. Cavallo believes this is due to an increased awareness of unhealthy relationships and the impact of childhood experience on mental health. “Obviously, that’s a positive,” she stresses, but “there’s also quite a lot of misinformation out there, and a lot of over-pathologising of family and friends as abusive or narcissistic” when perhaps they might not be.View image in fullscreenPsychotherapist Katherine Cavallo.She says that younger generations often do not share the same sense of “duty” towards their family as older ones do – which is not always a negative thing. But culturally, she describes “a growing trend towards emotional growth associated with individualism and a lack of tolerance of relationships that might interfere with that”.“I think the push for estrangement has been damaging for a lot of families,” she says. She adds, however, that she would recommend no contact if there were significant risks, such as violent or abusive behaviour. Cavallo does a risk assessment before any kind of family reunion work is considered.But low contact, she says, “is a good example of a kind of compromise. It gives an opportunity to explore what is possible without making a final decision and can be helpful in taking off the pressure.”It’s worth bearing in mind that no contact can simply be avoidance of difficult feelings. “Some people tend to think going no contact will make the challenges go away,” she says. “But, you know, your mother’s always going to be your mother, your brother’s going to be your brother. The relationships don’t go away by not having contact. And this is about finding ways to manage that which are a bit more nuanced, and can hopefully be more helpful.”Before mobile phones, the idea of calling a parent once a fortnight was seen as normal – and in some ways was healthierBoundaries can be creative, too. As well as focusing on length of contact and frequency, “I often suggest doing an activity rather than talking,” she says. “It might be helpful to meet in a neutral place, go bowling or play mini golf, particularly if there are children involved, without there being dialogue or opportunities for disputes.” Or you could “send each other photos, so you can maintain the relationship without there being dialogue”.There is also the potential regret to consider. Philip Karahassan is a psychotherapist with experience working with bereavement. He says many struggle to manage grief after the death of a family member with whom they had no contact. He highlights one person who did not even know their family member had a terminal illness: “The amount of clients that came to me and said, ‘I never got to say goodbye.’ While Karahassan is clear that every family is different, he is generally supportive of going low contact. “By taking that approach,” he says, people “are taking more control because they’re creating the boundaries that they want in that relationship.”View image in fullscreenPhilip Karahassan: ‘People are creating the boundaries they want in their relationships.’It is useful to remember that, not so long ago, lower contact between families was considered normal. Dr Lucy Blake, senior lecturer in psychology at the University of the West of England, explains the mainstream view within family therapy from the 1960s onwards was that “a typical family relationship is one where people have infrequent contact”. It is largely due to technological advances that people so often get in touch – if not through a visit or phone call, then via messages or social media or WhatsApp groups. Before mobile phones, the idea of calling a parent once a fortnight was seen as perfectly normal, and in some ways was healthier, she says.Low contact could be a way of countering the “idyllic” families presented on social media, she says, and for “easing those expectations”.Caroline is in her 50s and decided to go low contact with her mother three years ago, after a “tumultuous” lifelong relationship. After a lunch in which her mother was highly critical of her, Caroline was taken to hospital with a suspected heart attack – which turned out to be a panic attack. She decided she could not continue the relationship as it had been.She was clear with her mother about what she was doing. “I said, ‘Mom, I need to take some space.’ I set up all the support systems around her, and then I backed off. I told her I would contact her when I was ready to talk.” Crucially, she avoided saying her mother was the issue. “Me telling her it’s her would just create a bunch of stuff.” She still calls her every day, but her boundary is five minutes. “I have to keep it very limited, otherwise something comes up that really bothers me.” She sees her mother once a month. The space, without total avoidance, has led to self-reflection. “In going low contact I recognised some of this was triggers inside me that I needed to heal, not my mom,” she says.Caroline’s perspective on this is nuanced, seeing as her own adult children went no contact with her in 2024 after fallout from her difficult break-up with a partner. Today, her eldest son is still doing low contact. While she says this is incredibly painful, she is aware of her own “emotional immaturity”, due to her relationship with her mother. “Do I think time is passing us by and hope it doesn’t last for ever? Yes, but I’m not going to guilt him, because I know how he feels.” She adds: “For me, low contact is a tool that allows us to get the help we need, so we can decide if we want a full-time relationship with a person or not.” She advises parents: “Use this time wisely, because your child is probably going to come back and see if you have made any changes.”Adolescence lasts into your 30s – so how should parents treat their adult children?Read moreClearly, this level of self-reflection is the ideal, and not possible for all. The author and life coach Harriet Shearsmith says that some people find it difficult to maintain boundaries – and that doing so can take a toll emotionally. While, for some, low contact relationships can work, others experience pushback from relatives, such as a family member exploding and angrily asking, “Why aren’t you calling me?” or “playing the victim”. Others report silent treatment, or being talked about negatively to other family members. “It is not always a safe option,” she says.Like families themselves, low contact is complicated. For Marie, in a difficult patch of her own low contact, her overriding advice is clear: build up your support. “I would definitely advise having therapy while you’re doing it,” she says. “And try to find people around you who matter, relationships you can pour your all into.” As you attempt to reduce one bond, others become paramount.Explore more on these topicsFamilyParents and parentingPsychology (Science)Psychology (Education)ChildrenCounselling and therapyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We should use them so we can enjoy more of our destinationI hate walking anywhere. Whenever we explore Berlin, where we live, I prefer to cycle. It’s easier, it’s more fun, and it saves time. My husband disagrees. Frantz loves walking and I always end up trailing behind him by bike, which is uncomfortable because I have to pedal slowly to keep at his pace.Walking is boring; I find it monotonous. I don’t like how you take the same routes when walking, going up and down the same roads. When you go by bike you often find new trails and parks, and end up discovering new things. Frantz says the opposite, that walking helps you uncover neighbourhood gems, but I guess it depends what you’re looking for.We don’t have a car, and even though cycling can be hard in the snow and wind, it’s better than walkingI also prefer cycling because it frees up more time by reducing our commute. Berlin is a very walkable city, but in the winter it’s too cold to dawdle. We don’t have a car, and even though cycling can be hard in the snow and wind, it’s better than walking.Frantz always says I’m late for everything and biking is my attempt to be on time, but that’s not true. Cycling is my attempt to make the most of every moment. I don’t want to waste time pretending that slowness is a virtue. Sometimes at the weekend I can persuade him to join me, but other times he insists on walking, and this attempt at compromise pleases no one. He also still ends up waiting for me to lock up the bike whenever he wants to stop and look at something, or I end up waiting in the cold for him to come out of a shop and think: “I should have just walked.”We moved to our part of Berlin 12 years ago and only got our bikes two years ago, so really I am in the right because the bikes are still a novelty and we have walked around enough of our city as it stands. A walk can turn into a meander; with a bike you have a fun, quicker journey and get more time to enjoy the destination. It’s a far superior mode of transport.You be the judge – send us your domestic disputesRead moreThe defence: FrantzWalking is how you discover new things – Frida only prefers cycling because she’s always lateFrida is notoriously slow to go anywhere. Whenever we have a plan, she is always five or 10 minutes late. I used to get annoyed but it didn’t make her change, so why bother? I am on the one who keeps track of timings whenever we need to go out, and Frida only ever starts getting ready on the final call. When she reaches for her bike I sigh, because that adds another 15 minutes on to our timings.We each have foldable city bikes, and she needs to lug hers out of the apartment and down the steps, and get all her gear ready, whereas I am just good to walk out the door. I prefer walking because you can really discover things in the city. You can stop and say, “Let’s grab a coffee,” or “Can we buy a book here?” because you’re moving at a slow enough pace to notice things like the shops and the character of a neighbourhood. To me, it never gets old even though we’re not new to our city.Frida’s constant lateness is funny because German people are known for being rigid timekeepersI agree you get to your destination faster on a bike, but you don’t get to stop and smell the roses. Frida wants to go quickly to make up for being too slow to leave, but that’s her problem, not mine. If we have plans for dinner or a show, she will take the bike because she thinks it will help her get there faster, but it’s often too late to make up for lost time. Plus, I want to enjoy the journey, not rush to the destination.I think our upbringings have made us look at time differently. Frida’s constant lateness is funny because German people are known for being rigid timekeepers. I joke and say she’s not really German. We are both Afro-German, but I grew up in a white family, which I believe has made me more time-conscious. Frida grew up with her Caribbean side, and we joke that it’s made her too relaxed.I’m happy to cycle a little more to keep the peace but I also think Frida needs to speed up in general. A bike will not save her. We are in our 50s and have been together since we were 25, so I can’t see her internal pace changing – but a man can dream, can’t he?The jury of Guardian readersShould Frantzgive Frida’s idea a spin?Frantz is happy to cycle sometimes, which is a reasonable compromise. Frida is inconsistent, saying you find new trails by biking, and then complaining that walking leads to meandering.Josquine, 80Some people are punctual and some aren’t. It has nothing to do with upbringing, nationality or ethnicity, and it’s wrong to impose your personal preferences on your partner. As long as you both get to where you’re going, does it really matter how you get there? Being married doesn’t mean being joined at the hip.John, 69None of the stuff about being on time seems pertinent in this case, because the accuser is allegedly going to be late whatever form of travel she uses. They could compromise and both use bikes, but sometimes take indirect routes at a slow pace to explore less trodden paths.Eddie, 46Frantz shouldn’t have to sacrifice his walks because Frida can’t be on time. Maybe if they agree on set times to cycle, and other times to go on a walk, they could try to enjoy each other’s modes of transport.Ruby, 24Frantz and Frida have different preferences which are equally valid. I suggest taking turns: both cycle one day and walk the next. If they use different modes of transport, Frantz should start walking first, and Frida will easily catch up on her bike.Friederike, 60Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us:should Frantz get on his bike?The poll closes on Wednesday 11 February at 9am GMTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherEdwin should stop expecting his wife to attend all his family gatherings.95%of you said yes –Edwin is guilty5%of you said no –Edwin is innocentExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Whatever your motivation, there’s never been a better time to look for alternatives to the hard stuff.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The low- and no-alcohol categories are improving; these days there’s no excuse to serve you a sad lemonade just because you’re the designated driver. The world of low-alcohol beer is particularly noteworthy, with loads of brilliantly brewed lagers, pilsners, stouts and ales that are just as exciting and tasty as their alcoholic counterparts.Spiritsare good, too, with delicious agave-based liquids and dozens of gin-adjacent spirits I’d be happy to drink in a 0% G&T. Wines can be more challenging, I find, but there are some that taste more than passable, and sparkling wines, teas and the like are often excellent.Whether you want an alcohol-free fizz, fancy trying some award-winning cider without the headache or need a thoughtful gift for a teetotal friend, there’s plenty of great stuff out there.I’ve worked my way through 75 different booze-free beers, wines, spirits, kombuchas, premixed drinks and pretty much everything in between to find the best that’s on offer.Mid-strength drinks are having a moment. Here are 10 of the best lower-ABV beveragesRead moreTo make it into this list, I was looking for drinks under 2% ABV (the mid-strengthcategory hovering above this volume is also better than ever, but not so good for expectant mothers, drivers etc) that tasted delicious and worked as an alcohol alternative. While there are plenty of tasty shrubs, juices and sodas that can make sobriety a doddle, I didn’t consider them for this list.Here, then, is my pick of the best low- and no-alcohol drinks to raise a glass to, safe in the knowledge there’s no hangover imminent.The best non-alcoholic and low-alcohol drinks in 2026View image in fullscreenCheers to enjoying a tipple without paying for it the next day.Photograph: wilpunt/Getty ImagesBest low-alcohol red wineView image in fullscreenModerato merlot-tannat cuvee revolutionnaire, 0.5%£14 at Wise Bartender£14.50 at MajesticOf all the low-alcohol alternatives, a decent red wine is probably the hardest to find. Some taste like plasticky grape juice, while others try to replicate the complexity of an alcoholic red by introducing rogue flavours, such as beetroot and herbs.No one will mistake this Moderato for a fully fledged merlot, but it does have the characteristic dark fruit notes of that grape, and its structure puts it firmly on the wine spectrum, rather than juice. Overall, it tastes extremely pleasant. Using grapes sourced from vineyards in south-west France, this wine is cold-distilled in the country’s first dealcoholising centre, where they keep a careful eye on retaining the structure and aroma of the original wine. A decent food wine with rich casseroles and warming tagines, or enjoyed alone.Best alcohol-free ginView image in fullscreenCygnet Infinity, 0%£32 at Master of Malt£32 at CygnetWelsh gin brand Cygnet (co-founded by singer Katherine Jenkins) recently launched an alcohol-free expression. It’s created using the same 22 botanicals asCygnet 22 gin– though the brand insists it’s a standalone spirit rather than a gin imitation. It’s then further infused with all sorts of health buzzword ingredients, such as lion’s mane and Siberian ginseng, along with the manuka honey the gin is known for. The overall taste is honey-led with delicate florals and berries; deliciously light and botanical, and definitely nothing like a gin. It’s designed for sipping or mixing with soda, and I vastly prefer the latter of the two serves; drink with plenty of ice, a splash of soda and a berry garnish.Best sparkling teaView image in fullscreenFortnum & Mason sparkling tea, 0%£19.95 at Fortnum & MasonI’m a big fan of sparkling teas – they have a good level of complexity and tend not to be too sweet. This one from Fortnum’s is a favourite I return to often for giving as a gift and for celebrations. It’s dry and tannic, thanks to the blend of rare black, white and green teas, while being fresh, fruity and fragrant with herbaceous notes. It tastes properly luxurious.Rose Pouchong sparkling teais a new addition to the range,brewed with a single black tea and rose petals; if you like things sweeter and deeper, then this won’t disappoint.Best dealcoholised sparkling wineView image in fullscreenBolle blanc de blancs, <0.5%£19.99 at Drink Supermarket£20.50 at Mind Your WinesSparkling wines are probably the safest bet in the low and no categories. WhetherNozecoorVilarnau, I liked almost all of the low-alcohol fizzes I sampled, and many were truly excellent. This one edged ahead because of how expensive it tastes. It’s made in Spain using chardonnay grapes and is double fermented (as with champagne and cava) before being dealcoholised, and it’s a real treat however you look at it. It had a recognisable blanc de blancs profile – crisp orchard fruit and brioche notes – along with a properly persistent champagne-like mousse and a dryish finish. I’ll be buying this again.For morebooze-free bubbly, read our guide on thebestlow-alcohol prosecco, champagne and sparkling winesBest mocktailView image in fullscreenBelvoir Farm non-alcoholic lime and yuzu mojito, 0%£3.50 at Tesco£3.65 at WaitroseBelvoir Farm is better known for its nice cordials and soft drinks, but it now also has one of the biggest mocktail ranges in the UK. There’s passion fruit martini, peach bellini and more to choose from, but my pick is the Great Taste Award-winning lime and yuzu mojito, which is fresh, zesty and aromatic. Luscious-tasting and cooling, this mocktail is good on its own, but when muddled properly with fresh mint and lots of ice, no one would miss the real thing. I loved the unexpected edge that the yuzu brings.Best alcohol-free spiritView image in fullscreenThe Pathfinder hemp and root non-alcoholic spirit, <0.5%£29.75 at the Whisky Exchange£34.99 at AmazonSmoky, medicinal, herbal, bitter, citrusy, spicy: just some of the words I’d use to describe the taste of the Pathfinder, and I wouldn’t come close to defining its flavour. Darkly complex and intriguing, this new US-based alcohol-free spirit uses hemp, angelica root, juniper, saffron and other wild botanicals distilled into a liquid that works alone or in cocktails – as seen at the London cocktail bars Lyaness and Satan’s Whiskers. If you’re a fan of negroni, fernet or other amaro, then this is likely up your street. Try stirred with bitters, ice and a twist of orange for an alcohol-free twist on your favourites.Best alcohol-free tequila-style spirit (yes, really)View image in fullscreenAlmave Blancoblue agave spirit, 0%£22.05 at Master of Malt£21.39 at AmazonA zero-proof tequila-style spirit may not be the first thing you’d think to turn to when you’re not drinking, but this was an unexpected hit. Almave was founded by Lewis Hamilton in partnership with Mexican spirits group Casa Lumbre, and it has an immediately distinctive agave aroma, smelling and tasting extremely convincing. It’s genuinely nice even for sipping straight, but when made into a spicy margarita or mixed with grapefruit in a paloma, it’s fantastic.Best low-alcohol lagerView image in fullscreenBero Kingston golden pils, 0.5%£2.80 at Wise Bartender£22.99 for six at AmazonBeer is one of the best places to explore the no- and low-alcohol lifestyle from: there are more good 0% beers than there are bad these days. Bero Kingston pils is a newcomer that’s well worth a look if you fancy something fresh. It’s a big, bold malty lager, with enough bitterness and richness of aroma for you not to mind the lack of alcohol. Founded by actor Tom Holland,who has been sober since Dry January 2022, when he couldn’t find something to fill his Dry January with, Bero has a range of styles, fromhazy IPAtowheats. This full-bodied and flavoursome pils variety was my testers’ favourite.Best low-alcohol aleView image in fullscreenFirebrand Brewing Co Shorebreak hazy pale ale, 0.5%£3 at Wise Bartender£3.95 at Alcohol Free DrinksWhen summer finally arrives, you’ll be hard pressed to find a better drink to enjoy on the beach than this Cornish IPA. Ridiculously smooth, light and zingy with hoppy flavours, Firebrand Brewing’s Shorebreak bursts with hazily chilled tropical fruit flavours, such as pineapple, guava and banana. You might struggle to tell if it’s alcoholic or not – and when it tastes this great, with just 32 calories a can, who cares?I tried 40 tinned drinks: here are my favourite canned cocktails, wines and seltzers for sunny daysRead moreBest low-alcohol ciderView image in fullscreenChance Clean cider, 0.5%£3.06 at Alcohol Free Co£19.95 for 12 x 330ml at AmazonThe alcohol-free cider category has gone from strength to strength. I’m impressed with new brand Chance, which joins the lineup of great-tasting low-alcohol ciders that don’t just taste like apple juice. This is the UK’s first dedicated alcohol-free cider and has won a slew of awards for its crisp, citrussy taste. It’s bursting with British apple flavours and has a woody, grownup aftertaste that sets it apart from many others. Made by removing the alcohol from a punchy 8.2% cider, Chance manages to taste light yet retain the mouthfeel of a real alcoholic cider. It’s low in sugar, too.Best nootropic drinkView image in fullscreenSmiling Wolf functional mocktails, 0.5%£36.50 for 12 x 250ml at Smiling Wolf£24.50 for 8 x 250ml at AmazonAlcohol-free alternatives tend to either try to replicate the alcoholic counterpart or go the other way in the form of functional health drinks, sometimes known as nootropics, that don’t resemble booze at all. These new Smiling Wolf mocktails are a bit of a middle ground. Four flavours – mojito, negroni, G&T and aperitivo spritz – come in cool-looking ready-to-drink cans, taste good (though not quite close enough to convince you of the real thing) and all contain the Smiling Wolf proprietary blend. That is a combination of vitamins B3, B5 and B6, plus caffeine and the amino acids L-theanine, L-glycine and L-arginine, and it may help aid relaxation, energy and mood – never a bad addition. I liked the G&T a lot, and that’s what I’d normally drink, but the mojito had a lovely clean botanical flavour and I enjoyed the peachiness of the negroni.For more:The best no- and low-alcohol winesThe best mid-strength drinksJoanne Gould is afood, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Where they were once a simple rolling deck, treadmills today are often glossy pieces of interactive tech. Many now offer on-demand, real-time workouts (pioneered by Peloton) and the latest blockbuster movies via streaming services. Even if your treadmill doesn’t sport a whopping touchscreen display, it probably works nicely with heart-rate monitors, smartwatches and smartphone apps to track workouts and offer performance statistics after every session.Runningdecks have become more cushioned to offer better joint protection, and motor technology is now quieter and more efficient than ever. A treadmill still takes up a fair amount of space, but there are now compact folding options to help address this.The best treadmills on sale now are a far cry from those torturous devices designed to make the incarcerated sweat away their sins, offering ingenious ways to keep fit and, perhaps more importantly, makefitnessmore fun.At a glanceBest treadmill overall:Peloton Tread£3,499 at AmazonBest budget treadmill:JTX Slimline£549 at JTX FitnessBest for gym quality:JTX Sprint-9 Pro£1,549 at JTX FitnessBest folding treadmill:ProForm Pro 9000£1,429 at ProFormWhy you should trust meAs a fitness fan partaking in gym-based strength training, outdoor trail runs, kickboxing classes and cold-water surfing, I have long been tasked with testing exercise gear for leading fitness and technology magazines.Whatever I’m testing, I’ve always been one to get stuck in, whether that’s surfing with the latestsmartwatchin cold weather or feeling the burn with a set of connected kettlebells.I’m a strong believer in living with new-fangled tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I’ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the right environment. When it comes to treadmills, that has been to the detriment of any additional storage space my terrace house offers.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I aimed to rack up as much mileage as possible.’Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianWithout wanting to become a “first-world problems” meme, testing treadmills isn’t easy. They’re massive, for one, which means logistical management in having them delivered and then collected.I tested all the treadmills on this list over several months, trialling some systems for weeks, and others over a couple of arduous sessions. Where I could introduce a model to my home, I did. If it didn’t fit there, it was shoehorned into an office space I rent.Failing that, I arranged to get hands-on (or should that be feet-on?) with a model at the manufacturer’s headquarters or a dedicated showroom. One of the treadmills was handily used by my local gym.With every treadmill, I aimed to test all the connected features, typically pairing a smartwatch (AppleandGarmin) and a chest-based heart-rate monitor, as well as trialling any on-demand video and audio services. Where relevant, I tried live and on-demand workouts on any subscription packages and any gamified content available.During each test, I aimed to rack up as much mileage as possible, sweating it out over longer runs and more intense sprint sessions. If an elevation feature was available, I activated it, and if there was sled or resistance training, I’d dive into that too.Most of the treadmills were tested in a space where I could assess how much noise they made when in use, rather than trialling them in a busy gym where the thump of a deck or the whine of an electric motor is typically drowned out by background noise.All of the units were only ever offered to me on a loan basis, so they’ve made their way back to their respective suppliers. Due to this, it would be wrong of me to comment on their longevity or ability to withstand years of abuse, although I did get a good feel for build quality in the time I spent with them.The best treadmills in 2026View image in fullscreen‘Opens up a world of on-treadmill training sessions, live classes and in-depth programmes’: the Peloton Tread.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianBest treadmill overall:Peloton TreadPelotonTreadfrom£3,499£3,499 at Peloton£3,499 at AmazonWhat we loveWorkouts are engaging – and addictiveWhat we don’t loveIt’s expensive, and so is the subscriptionPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£3,499 at Peloton£3,499 at AmazonPelotonarguably dragged the treadmill into the 21st century when it launched the Tread. The brand ushered in an era of on-demand classes led by real instructors, accountability in the form of live leaderboards and a plethora of engaging workouts able to be performed anywhere and at any time.Who knew that bolting a big touchscreen to a fairly standard treadmill would cause such a stir? However, Peloton sales soared during the pandemic, and it continues to be one of the best products for most people, beginners and seasoned runners alike. As a result, it has spawned several rivals.In terms of cushioning, noise levels and deck comfort, the treadmill experience offered by the Peloton Tread is good, but it’s not the best out there. In fact, there are better for the money. But what makes Peloton worth the cost is that its fitness ecosystem of live and on-demand classes is so good. There’s very little else out there that’s as fun, engaging and supportive, helping not only those at the beginning of their fitness journey but also improving performance in more serious athletes.Why we love itPeloton’s treadmill itself is a neat piece of equipment, with its compact and easy-to-live-with design slotting into most domestic settings. The unit is competitive in terms of its top speeds and max incline (20km/h and 12.5% grade), while two simple roller mechanisms control both. During some sessions, the Tread will automatically adjust, depending on the goals.Although neither the quietest nor the most cushioned deck to run on, this machine majors in its expansive All-Access membership. This opens up a world of on-treadmill training sessions, live classes hosted by instructors who have now gained quasi-celebrity status, and in-depth training programmes covering everything from couch to 5K up to marathon prep.Should you not feel like being instructed by a bubbly, gorgeous and irritatingly tanned personal instructor, you can always binge movies, audiobooks and live and on-demand TV shows by harnessing the Peloton Entertainment app offering, or pump a popular music playlist from the impressive 26W front-facing speakers. This is all delivered via the crisp 23.8in full colour, high-definition touchscreen.Although there are now rivals that offer a similar level of interactivity and technology, few have managed to nail the execution quite like Peloton. It’s fun, highly polished and motivating, all at the same time. Above all else, it’s addictive – and surely that’s all you can ask for in the quest to keep fit.It’s a shame that …it’s expensive, and membership to online classes costs an additional £45 a month.Dimensions:84 x 173 x 157cm (WLH)Weight:132kgRunning area:50 x 150cmMax speed:20km/hMax incline:12.5%Folding:noBuilt-in entertainment:yes, through Peloton’s dedicated Entertainment appPelotonTreadfrom£3,499£3,499 at Peloton£3,499 at AmazonWhat we loveWorkouts are engaging – and addictiveWhat we don’t loveIt’s expensive, and so is the subscriptionBest budget treadmill:JTX SlimlineJTXSlimline£549£549 at JTX FitnessWhat we loveCompact, lightweight and affordableWhat we don’t loveNot sturdy enough for intense workouts£549 at JTX FitnessIf you can overlook the fact that this doesn’t feel as robust as its larger, static rivals (see below), this Slimline model from JTX is perfect for those who lack the space at home for a full-size treadmill – it folds flat and can easily be moved into storage when not in use.The company also offersan incline version(about £699), which feels surprisingly stable at maximum incline when running, but this cheaper and more basic option is perfect for those who prefer jogging, lower-impact training or simply those who want to increase their daily step count.With a 16km/h top speed, it’s no slouch, but the narrow deck and 1.75hp motor won’t suit those hoping for a more punishing workout.Why we love itUnlike so many treadmills available today, the JTX Slimline is compact and lightweight, making it relatively easy to wheel around tighter spaces. After all, not everyone is blessed with a dedicated gym at home, so we often have to make do with a temporary setup in the living room. The Slimline is perfect for this.The machine folds flat when it’s not in use, and it can be propped against a wall or tucked away in a cupboard to keep it out of sight. It features an impressive top speed, which is great for something so compact, while the small performance motor is relatively quiet.Users will have to bring their own entertainment in the form of a tablet or music played through headphones, but the unit does feature built-in Bluetooth so it can relay running data to accompanying apps, such asStravaor theZwiftvirtual running software.It’s a shame that …it feels too flimsy to endure serious sprint training, yet it’s too large and bulky to take the place of a simple walking deck for daily step-count enthusiasts.Dimensions:70 x 152 x 125cm (WLH)Weight:43kgRunning area:45 x 122cmMax speed:16km/hMax incline:0%Folding:yesBuilt-in entertainment:noJTXSlimline£549£549 at JTX FitnessWhat we loveCompact, lightweight and affordableWhat we don’t loveNot sturdy enough for intense workoutsBest treadmill for gym quality:JTX Sprint-9 ProJTXSprint-9 Profrom£1,549£1,549 at JTX Fitness£1,699 at AmazonWhat we loveBuilt to last, and suits serious runnersWhat we don’t loveNo interactive screen or fancy features£1,549 at JTX Fitness£1,699 at AmazonJTX likes to pride itself on offering commercial-grade fitness equipment for those on a domestic budget. The resulting kit is built to last, comes with a generous warranty and provides a similar experience to what you might find in your local gym.The Sprint-9 Pro may lack the bells, whistles and interactive touchscreens of more expensive rivals, but it has a generously sized running deck, a powerful 4hp brushless motor, and a whopping 22km/h top speed at an 11% max incline.Why we love itWith its punchy motor and serious incline, this treadmill makes it possible to achieve a challenging workout without a fitness professional telling you what to do. You can always set up a tablet or smartphone to indulge in a Peloton-esque experience with the appropriate apps and subscriptions, of course, but JTX also offers 36 preinstalled workout programmes for those who like to keep things slightly more analogue.The build quality is excellent, the CushionStep running deck spacious and comfortable, and the built-in Bluetooth speakers make it possible to soundtrack a run when paired with a tablet or phone – just don’t expect Ibiza club levels of sound quality.Don’t be fooled by its lack of an interactive screen: the Sprint-9 Pro still synchronises running data with services such as Zwift, Strava andKinomap(as well as connecting to Bluetooth heart-rate monitors). You just have to provide your own technology to make the most of these features.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t have easy-to-reach adjustment dials for speed and incline, and the built-in heart-rate sensors aren’t the most comfortable to hold.Dimensions:84 x 195 x 155cm (WLH)Weight:125kgRunning area:55 x 152cmMax speed:22km/hMax incline:11%Folding:noBuilt-in entertainment:noJTXSprint-9 Profrom£1,549£1,549 at JTX Fitness£1,699 at AmazonWhat we loveBuilt to last, and suits serious runnersWhat we don’t loveNo interactive screen or fancy featuresBest folding treadmill:ProForm Pro 9000ProFormPro 9000from£1,429£1,429 at ProForm£1,599 at John LewisWhat we loveCan fold up to save spaceWhat we don’t loveSlightly narrower running deck£1,429 at ProForm£1,599 at John LewisFolding treadmills can lack the build quality and premium features of their non-collapsible counterparts, but the Pro 9000 is one of the few that aims to pack in the tech. A 3.6hp motor doesn’t want for power, offering a 22km/h top speed and a respectable 12% incline, while the deck features ReBound Pro Cushioning for a little flex underfoot to protect the joints.There’s a compromise when it comes to running deck space, though, as it’s slightly narrower than larger, fixed treadmills. However, folding it up is a simple process and, when placed in its upright position, it can be rolled into a cupboard or stored against a wall to free up space.Why we love itIt’s easy to scrimp on features when producing a folding treadmill, but ProForm packs a lot in here … not to mention an impressive running experience. The motor is plenty powerful enough, with a top speed that rivals anything here, while the Digital Quick Decline/Incline control is great for brutal hill sprint sessions. The deck is great at reaching the desired incline or decline at speed.ProForm has long partnered withiFit, which provides a similar on-demand and live workout environment to Peloton and Technogym. This can be accessed via the wifi-enabled 21.5in HD colour touchscreen display.

The same goes for the most powerful motors, advanced running deck technology and greater connectivity features, as these all demand healthier budgets.The most affordable treadmills generally start at about £500 – anything less than that isn’t typically worth your money. Prices then rise to £3,000 or more (see the Technogym Run) for the most technologically advanced and commercial-grade units.The best massage guns: tried and tested relief for sore, tired musclesRead moreHow much room do you need?The smallest treadmill on this list still measures 70 x 152 x 125cm (WLH) and you will want to factor in some wriggle room around that to ensure your arms aren’t bashing against a wall and your head isn’t hitting the ceiling. If storage space is a problem, take a look at the folding treadmills on this list. Typically, they fold flat and feature wheels so that they can be rolled into a more convenient space and stored upright to keep the floor clear.What features should I look out for?More serious runners should look at more powerful motors because they often provide the fastest running speeds and a more natural running experience. Incline and decline features are great for mimicking runs out in the wild, and a well-cushioned deck is important for protecting the joints.Most manufacturers don’t cite figures for decibel levels emitted during operation, but it’s worth considering that some treadmills are quieter than others. Finally, connected features are fantastic for keeping track of training, ensuring runs are interesting and generally entertaining during an arduous workout. However, that doesn’t mean you necessarily need a massive display, as tethering a tablet or a smartphone can do just as good a job.How do I oil my treadmill at home?It’s always best to consult the user manual for details on how to lubricate a treadmill belt and how often to do so, as some brands produce systems that don’t need any maintenance and this could void a warranty.Use a 100% silicone lubricant that the manufacturer supplies, or buy adedicated treadmill lubricantto avoid damaging the belt. Unplug the treadmill, lift the edges of the treadmill belt and apply lubricant in a zigzag fashion to the centre where your feet strike. Turn on the treadmill and walk slowly for about two minutes to allow the lubricant to work its way across the entirety of the running deck.Treadmills vs walking padsWhile a treadmill can be used for walking, it’s typically more versatile than awalking padin that it can support jogging sessions and faster training. Higher-end treadmills will also have more features than a walking pad, such as the ability to automatically adjust incline and decline, connect to on-demand workout programmes from the likes of Peloton and iFit, and offer built-in workouts. On the other hand, walking pads are usually smaller and easier to store, with some folding in half so they can be housed underneath a desk when not in use.For more:The best running watchesThe best cross trainersLeon Poultney has been traversing the worlds of consumer technology and automotive for some of thebiggest lifestyle websites and magazines for longer than he cares to divulge.

For our four-year-old goddaughter, it is always that time of year. Just hearing the two words together makes her roll her eyes and roll out her little tongue in anticipation of pleasure, like a cartoon kid. When we told her we would come and bake a chocolate cake with her, there were squeals of joy.Settling on a recipe was the first challenge – Ravneet Gill’sfudgy one, Felicity Cloake’sperfect oneand Benjamina Ebuehi’straybaked onewere all contenders. We eventually landed on Samin Nosrat’s much-loved, tried-and-testedmidnight chocolate cake.It was to be a learning experience for us as much as for her – we never knew that you can make chocolate cake only while wearing a crown. She had to explain this to us at length. The reasoning had something to do with warding off ghosts and crocodiles – or perhaps the crocodiles were warding off the ghosts, and the crowns were for something else.Blueywas involved as well.After donning our crowns and aprons, and setting off to the kitchen, it became very clear who was actually in charge of the process. Heavy is the head that wears the crown, and the girl, who speaks mostly in the imperative, began shooting out instructions with the speed and confidence of a football coach. At one point, we had to cut baking paper to size, then we had to draw dragons on the baking paper, which led to a very serious discussion about which of the dragons was good and which evil, and how many there should be of each, in case we needed to draw more. (The verdict: in life, as in cake, balance matters.)View image in fullscreenHere be dragons … Itamar and Sarit’s godchild takes the lead.Photograph: Itamar SrulovichWhen baking with a child, precision gives way to play, efficiency to imagination. Throwaway moments – lifting a heavy bowl, cracking an egg, sifting cocoa, licking a spoon, placing a cake in the oven – become moments of reverence and revelation. Burying our noses together in the cake fresh out of the oven to breathe in that smell, the anxious anticipation for it to cool so we could decorate it. There is no overstating the importance of sprinkles to the process – here, more is more is more is more, and the merits of each type can be endlessly discussed and compared.Over the next few weeks, we will be baking lots of chocolate cakes, as well asbabkas, heart-shaped cookies and many other sweet romantic treats, and while we have certainly – maybe sadly – outgrown sprinkles, this kitchen experience has been a timely reminder that baking is nothing short of magic.All of this is to explain that if you see us in one of our places carrying a tray of baked goods, we may be wearing paper crowns.

In the small kitchen is Leonardo Cioni, a tall chef from San Giovanni Valdarno, midway between Florence and Arezzo, who, for the past three-and-a-half years, has run box 37 asSicché Roba Toscana, which roughly translates as “therefore Tuscan stuff”. The escaping steam is effective advertising, leading eyes to the blackboard above the counter to discover exactly what is going on in the back.Always on the menu islampredotto. The fourth stomach of the cow and the most tender, delicate tripe, lampredotto looks like a damp dishcloth crossed with a heavily ruffled shirt. It is prepared by simmering it in broth made from onion, carrot, celery, tomatoes, parsley and basil for about an hour and a half, then seasoned with salt and pepper, and served in a roll, maybe with a spoonful of salsa verde. Also made daily by Leo, and many times over, are trays oftorta di ceci, a baked chickpea flour pancake much like farinata that is sandwiched in a flatbread calledschiaccia, which can also be filled with salumi or cheese. The rest of the menu changes daily, but always includes a bean dish, at least one legume and vegetable soup (often thickened with polenta or bread), some sort of long-braised stew and maybe a ragu.It was the steam fromragu dicapocollothat caught my attention a couple of months ago. So much so that we, Bisto kids in middle-aged bodies, returned an hour and a half later and sat at the multicoloured tiled counter to order it: dense, succulent and with a red-tinted, oily halo, and served on small potato gnocchi.Capocollo (pork neck), which is also known as pork collar or pork neck fillet, comes from the upper part of the pig’s shoulder, an area naturally and generously marbled with fat. It is this marbled combination of flesh and fat that contributes to the succulence of this particular ragu, as well as to the ragu’s ability not only to stand up to but to benefit from three powerful herbs: bay, sage and rosemary. What also struck me about Leo’s version is that he uses minced capocollo, as opposed to braising a whole joint then shredding the meat at the end – which is also great, but I prefer the texture that mince produces. Alternatively, you could mix leaner cuts with back bacon – the key is a generous amount of fat.Pork ragu with herbs (for gnocchi or pasta)Serves4400gpork mince, ideally well-marbled with fat, so neck, shoulder or jowl)3-4 tbspolive oil1 medium onion, or three shallots, peeled and finely diced2 bay leaves2 sage leaves2 sprigs of rosemary; 1 leaves picked and minced, 1 left wholeSalt1 small glassdry white wine400g tinplum tomatoes, crushed or passed though a food mill1 tbsptomato concentrate500g potato gnocchi, or fresh pappardelleGrated parmesan, or grana padanoWorking in a heavy-based pan or casserole on a medium-low heat, fry the minced pork in olive oil, moving it around the pan until it has lost all pinkness. Add the onion, bay, sage, minced and whole rosemary, and a pinch of salt, and continue cooking (and stirring) until the onion is translucent.Add the white wine, leave it to bubble for a minute or two, then add the tinned tomatoes, tomato concentrate, another small pinch of salt and a small glass of warm water. Half-cover the pan with a lid and turn down the heat so the ragu simmers gently for two hours. Check and stir every now and then, adding another small glass of warm water if the contents of the pan seem at all dry. By the end of cooking, the ragu should be dense but succulent with an oily halo.Cook the gnocchi (or pasta) in plenty of well-salted, boiling water, then lift into a warm bowl. Add a spoonful of finely grated parmesan or grana padano, toss, then add half the ragu and toss again. Divide between four plates or shallow bowls and top with more ragu and more cheese, if you wish.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkMain coursePastaPorkMeatVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In the basement ofLarry King’s salon in Marylebone, London, stylist and curly hair advocate Jennie Roberts is giving me a much-needed pep talk. “It’s all about education and making everything simplified,” she says, perhaps sensing my apprehension as I stand uneasily before her with a comb in hand.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“It’s not a big effort, it is not going to cost a lot of money. Managing curly hair, once you know how, is easy,” Roberts says. “It really is. It’s easier than trying to hide it anyway.”The curly hair in question isn’t mine but that of my two daughters, aged three and four-and-a-half. After months of screaming and unsatisfying results, I’ve taken it upon myself to learn the basics of caring for their hair, which is a combination of mymixed-race afro curlsand my wife’s straighter Spanish locks.Roberts, who has styled everyone from Thandiwe Newton to Mel B and now offers courses for handling Black curls, doesn’t have an easy task in front of her as she needs to try to undo decades’ worth of my own hair ignorance.View image in fullscreen‘Turns out I was making some fundamental mistakes.’Photograph: Wunmi Onibudo/The GuardianFor me – and many other Black men – hair care begins and ends withthe barber shop: a male-only space of unsolicited political opinions, fades and buzzing clippers. Black female hair, however, remains a mystery.I barely know the difference between 4C curls and a 4B pencil. Hand me a pair of straighteners and I’d probably assume you toss salad with them. Take me to a Pak’s store and I’d be clueless.My earliest salon experiences are of my sisters having their hair done before we travelled to Nigeria for the first time as four-year-olds. Our auntie would run a comb roughly through their hair, which produced yelps and questionable results. I checked in with them before writing this article and my memories are correct; in fact, there are more horror stories I wasn’t privy to. My older sister also passed out after having her hair braided for hours, and both of them are emotionally scarred after having their hair “thinned” by a white stylist.For many Black and mixed-race people, hair trauma is very real. A 2021 report by Pantene found that 93% of people withafro hair had faced discrimination, while painful experiences at salons are seen as something women with Black hairjust have to go through. Roberts says that is rubbish. “I don’t have trauma in my life around my hair,” she tells me. “I’ve always embraced my curls, it’s never occurred to me to straighten my hair, because I love it.”Roberts is an outlier. Black British women spend£168m a year on hair products, with an average Black woman spending between three and six times more per year on their hair than their white counterparts.In 2026 there is a growing movement of Black fathers who are learning to care for their children’s hair. Jamelia Donaldson is the founder of Black beauty companyTreasure Tress. She’s been running crash courses for Black men who want to learn how to care for Black hair for a couple of years now. Despite there also being hair-braiding courses for Black women, Donaldson says it’s the Black men who always get attention on social media. “I think it is the juxtaposition of being dad and hair,” she says. “People don’t associate the two, they feel like the mums will just do it.”View image in fullscreenLanre swaps a brush for a manta comb, to gently unpick any tangles.Photograph: Wunmi Onibudo/The GuardianThe poet and authorYomi Ṣodetook part in a workshop to lighten the load on his partner, who was caring for her own hair, Ṣode’s and their two children’s. He signed up for a class and was soon learning how to plait and do partings. “I wanted to learn, so I can cover and step in and have this skill,” he says. “Also, if I can do a bad boy hairstyle, if I do the wickedest parting, I feel so proud. Even though it takes me 45 minutes to do what my partner can do in five minutes.”Ṣode sees hair care as a vital part of connecting with his daughter, and Donaldson says that sentiment is widespread among attenders. “A lot of them understood the significance of hair and the fact that it is an opportunity for bonding and they just wanted to be more involved,” she says. Black women have told her that their fondest memories are of their fathers doing their hair. “It’s not celebrated enough,” Donaldson adds.Now it’s my turn (we’re mainly focusing on my eldest daughter, who has the longest hair at present, although the tips are applicable to both of them). Roberts starts by asking me how I look after the girls’ hair. It’s a mix of a Tresemmé shampoo for curly hair and then a hair mask, which is applied and rinsed out. Then the combing begins, which usually results in our eldest daughter screaming as any knots are detangled. It’s a laborious process that often results in both parents and children on edge and sometimes in tears. Afterwards, I apply a leave-in moisturiser from Black British brandJim + Henryand plait or put her hair up in bunches using hair ties.View image in fullscreen‘If I can do a bad boy hairstyle, and the wickedest parting, I feel so proud’ … Jennie Roberts.Photograph: Wunmi Onibudo/The GuardianTurns out I’m making some fundamental mistakes. First, the hair ties I’m using are far too unforgiving. The tight, elasticated ones we favour are a nightmare to remove. They cling to hair, meaning that when I attempt to extract them they pull, causing pain as the hair catches. The solution is to replace them with silky, looser hair ties that are cheap and, more importantly, slide off hair rather than clinging to every strand (Roberts doesn’t even try to take out the old ties, opting to cut them off so as not to cause pain).The other obvious flaw in my hair game is my brushing technique and the equipment I’m using. At present I’m applying detangler, then combing from the scalp down to the end of the hair. That causes yelps of pain from my eldest daughter, and is – as Roberts tells me – a terrible approach.The brush I’m using is a non-starter: with hard short teeth, it is fine on my wife’s straight hair, but far too inflexible on my daughters’ curls. Jennie recommends amanta comb, which featured on Dragons’ Den and has far fewer teeth, which are longer and spaced out.Technique-wise, I need to start at the bottom of the hair, identify tangles, then use the longer teeth to gently unpick them andthencomb the hair. Roberts shows me how to slowly move methodically up the hair as you go. Our eldest daughter, who usually screams the house down when she has her hair combed, is sitting quietly and seems to be enjoying the process. I have a go, and the unpicking technique needs meticulous attention, but 1) produces no screams from my daughter and 2) delivers untangled hair more quickly.Some of the advice seems to come from left-field, such as not using a towel to dry my daughters’ hair. “Use an old T-shirt,” Roberts says. What’s the thinking behind that? “The T-shirt doesn’t have a pile on it, which can cause friction and ruin the curls. All you’re doing is damaging the hair and undoing all the good you’ve done.” Hard to argue with that one, and the one thing I do have in this life is old T-shirts.View image in fullscreen‘The next time we do “salon night” I’m armed with my new skills.’Photograph: Wunmi Onibudo/The GuardianThe hair products I’m using are also far too heavy for my daughter’s hair. They’re great products but just meant for much tighter curls. They need to be replaced by lighter serums (Roberts recommends theCurly Ellie range) that will accentuate the curls and gels if I’m looking for more hold.While the T-shirt towel is a nice money-saver, something worth spending on is a diffuser. After the T-shirt pat-down (or “plump”, to use the technical term) and an application of leave-in moisturiser, I need to get comfortable, put the dryer on a low setting and allow it to work its magic and bring out the curls.Roberts gently places the hair on her massive diffuser, which looks as if it could double as a satellite dish, and patiently lets the heat move through the hair. Rather than the quick two-minute blast I usually apply, this takes almost 10 minutes.In the hour or so the tutorial takes, there’s a lot of information to take in. I’m certainly not an expert but the key takeaways are patience, technique and jettisoning my current methods that often make things worse.We leave with some silk pillows to protect the girls’ hair at bedtime, and the next time we do “salon night” I’m armed with my new skills.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.ThePixelBuds 2a uses the design of the excellent Pixel Buds Pro 2 with a few high-end features at a more palatable £109 (€129/$129/A$239) price, undercutting rivals in the process.That makes the Buds 2a some of the smallest and most comfortable earbuds on the market, with a disc the size of a Smartie chocolate protruding from your ear canal and no stalk to get in the way of earrings.View image in fullscreenThe compact form and soft silicone stabiliser make the Buds 2a very comfortable.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianEach earbud has a small silicone stabiliser that rests against the inside of your ear opposite the tip to securely hold them in place without putting undue pressure on any soft tissue. That makes them super comfortable for long periods of listening time without feeling as if they’re going to fall out, even during vigorous movement.The disk is touch-sensitive for tap controls for playback, noise cancelling and accessing Gemini. They work well but they lack the excellent swipe gesture for volume control from the Pixel Buds Pro 2, which is a shame.The battery lasts a solid seven or so hours with noise cancelling while the compact flip-top case recharges the buds about 1.8 times for a total of 20 hours playback. The case is great, but the white picks up marks easily, including staining from jeans and other clothing.SpecificationsWater resistance:IP54 (splash resistant)Connectivity:Bluetooth5.4 (SBC, AAC)Battery life:7h with ANC (20h with case)Earbud dimensions:23.1 x 16 x 17.8mmEarbud weight:4.7g eachDriver size:11mmCharging case dimensions:50 x 57.2 x 24.5mmCharging case weight:47.6gCase charging:USB-CNot just for AndroidView image in fullscreenThe Android app handles settings and updates, including an equaliser for customising sound, or you can use Google’s web app on a computer.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Buds 2a have the same Google Tensor A1 chip as their Pro siblings, which ensures rock-solid connectivity with any standard Bluetooth device, including Android phones, iPhones, tablets, consoles and computers. ThePixel Buds app on Androidadjusts settings and controls, butGoogle’s web appcan do similar on a Mac, Windows PC or Chromebook in the browser.They can connect to two devices at once and support the standard SBC and AAC Bluetooth audio formats. Call quality is reasonable if a bit quiet, meaning you have to talk up in silent spaces, and they let through background noise on busy streets but not enough to drown out my voice.The earbuds can also be used to talk toGemini Liveon a compatible phone, including reading out notifications and other features.SustainabilityGoogle does not provide an expected lifespan for the batteries. Those in similar devices typically maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for 500 full charge cycles. The batteries in the earbuds are not replaceable but the battery in the case can be replaced with standard tools. Repair specialists iFixit awarded the earbudsfour out of 10 for repairability.The Buds 2a are made withat least 41% recycled materialsincluding cobalt, plastic, rare-earth elements and tin. Google breaks down the earbuds’ environmental impactin its reportand willrecycle old devicesfor free.Rounded sound and solid noise cancellingView image in fullscreenThe Buds 2a magnetically clip into their compact case for charging and storage.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe sound quality is very good for a set of everyday earbuds. They do a good job with most genres, with solid separation of tones, plenty of bass where needed and relatively detailed mids and highs. They sound great with rock, pop and electronica, but lack a bit of nuance in classical tracks.The Buds 2a also support spatial audio with compatible phones, but not head-tracking, which is a feature reserved for their more expensive siblings. It works well with film and TV shows with a Pixel phone.The new buds are the first in Google’s A-series to have active noise cancelling. It is not quite as effective as that in the Buds Pro 2, but does a very good job for the money. It reduces road roar and engine noise, street sounds and background hubbub, but struggles to keep out higher tones such as the clicks of keyboards or chatter in the office.The cheaper buds also lack adaptive sound and the ability to automatically dampen loud noise when using the ambient sound mode, but I don’t think they are crucial features.PriceThe Google Pixel Buds 2a cost£109(€129/$129/A$239).For comparison, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 cost£169, theNothing Ear 3cost£149, theFairphone Fairbudscost£66.75, theApple AirPods 4cost from£119and theAirPods Pro 3cost£219.VerdictThe Pixel Buds 2a are a great set of Bluetooth earbuds for more than just Android at a good price.Their compact form and shape make them very comfortable and discreet, lacking the stalks that are popular with rivals. The battery life is solid, the case nice and compact, and they work well, connecting to two devices at once.They sound great for everyday earbuds and the noise cancelling is good for the money. They lack a few bells and whistles including onboard volume control, adaptive audio and wireless charging, plus their call quality is only average.One of the best upgrades is an easily replaceable battery in the case, which is progress towards better sustainability. But the batteries in the earbuds remain irreplaceable, ultimately making them disposable.Pros:compact, comfortable, seven-hour battery, great case, good sound and noise cancelling, multipoint Bluetooth, case with replaceable battery, web app for use with computers.Cons:earbuds unrepairable, no volume control gesture, no support for higher quality Bluetooth formats, average call quality, no adaptive audio or loud noise protection for transparencyExplore more on these topicsGooglePixelAlphabetHeadphonesBluetoothGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

And it’s true that illnesses are more common during the winter months, but is it true that you are more likely to catch the flu if you forget your hat?Not exactly. Writing inThe Conversation, medical microbiologist Manal Mohammed from the University of Westminster has explained that colds and flu are caused by viruses that spread either by respiratory droplets or person to person regardless of the temperature. However, there is a bit of truth in the idea – many viruses survive for longer in colder and dryer conditions, increasing the chances of them hanging around and infecting a fresh victim. Cold weather also encourages us to spend more time indoors, and in crowded and poorly ventilated spaces viruses can build up and jump from person to person more easily. Reduced sunlight in winter also lowers production of Vitamin D, which can lead to a weakened immune system.Understanding the link between cold weather and spread of viruses helps us better reduce risk of transmission, by improving indoor ventilation and humidity levels, and keeping our Vitamin D levels topped up. Public health messaging that drums home the message that viruses spread via contact and respiratory droplets are more effective than being nagged to wrap up warm.Explore more on these topicsFluWeatherwatchHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Born in Milan in 2000, Paralympic swimmer Simone Barlaam is a 23-time world champion who won three golds and a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics. He’s a torchbearer and ambassador for the Milano Cortina Winter Olympic Games, which run from 6-22 February (the Paralympic Games run from 6-15 March) at sites across Lombardy and north-east Italy (with events such as speed skating, figure skating and ice hockey in the city). He also worked as agraphic designerfor the games.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Barlaam grew up in Milan and lives in NoLo (North of Loreto), a vibrant, artistic neighbourhood. “I’ve lived all over the place, so I can take you around the city and the places that belong to my heart,” he says. Here, he chooses his favourite spots, beyond obvious sights such as the Duomo, La Scala opera house and the glossy Quadrilatero della Moda fashion district.View image in fullscreenA view over Parco Sempione and Sforza Castle in the heart of Milan.Photograph: Andrei Domanin/AlamyFoodIf I’m training, there’s this beautiful pastry shop next to my pool that I go to with my teammates after a long, hard session:Pasticceria Grossiin Piazzale Udine. It’s the best coffee place.I likePanificio Storico Vailation Via Vitruvio because the pastries are lovely, and it’s welcoming and warm – they treat you as if they’ve known you for the last 30 years.Pizzeria da Mimmonear Chinatown has a special place in my heart because my parents always used to take us there for lunch. It’s a very small place and the pizza slices are very thick, soft and fluffy, like a cloud. Every time I go there, I feel like a kid again.When I was a student, studying at the Politecnico di Milano, I would go to Grano e Caffè in Viale Romagna, where the food is very cheap and very fresh. If I want to treat myself I go toRatanàon Via Gaetano de Castillia, it’s the restaurant of my friend and chef Cesare Battisti. It has traditional dishes likemondeghili, a type of fried meatball made of leftovers, and I think it does the best risotto in town. I also love a Vietnamese restaurant calledVietnam Mon Amour, where I used to go as a student. It’s tiny and the food is amazing.NeighbourhoodView image in fullscreenSimone shopping in Milan’s Chinatown.Photograph: Laura CoffeyVia Paolo Sarpi, in Chinatown is a must, and comes alive at night. There are so many places to eat – restaurants as well as amazing street food places. There are a few karaoke places too – it’s fun to go with your friends and just sing and make a fool out of yourself.FashionMilan is the city of Armani, and there is so much of Giorgio’s legacy here. It’s an incredible honour to have developed a race suit with them. When Giorgio passed away, I went to the funeral and the queue of people there to say goodbye was kilometres long. That showed how much people love him and how his legacy affected this city.InspirationView image in fullscreenSimone finds visits to Milan’s old aquarium fascinating.Photograph: PhotoFires/AlamyTheAcquario Civico di Milano, one of the oldest aquariums in Europe, was built in the early 20th century. There are sculptures of the sea and fish around the building. Part of the aquarium is outside, with freshwater fish; most of the displays are dedicated to Italian aquatic environments, though inside there’s a little tropical aquarium too. What I love about water is the sense of freedom it gives me, because obviously, for a person with a disability, I’m very clumsy and not very graceful on land – but in the water, I’m fast and can be agile. It feels almost like flying. I could stay for hours just watching a fish swim in an aquarium, it’s mesmerising. I have this passion that I can’t really express in words about swimming creatures, they give me a kind of peace.Green spaceMilan is full of little green parks, butParco Sempioneis one of the best and it’s connected to the medieval Castello Sforzesco, the triumphal arch Arco della Pace and the excellentMuseum of Triennale. It has so many cool events - live music, concerts, exhibitions – they aredisplaying original Olympic postersuntil 15 March.AccessibilityMost of the time, Milan is an accessible city. It’s flat, and with the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games, there have been many renovations in the city. For example, they’ve finally built an elevator at the metro stop in front of my house. But obviously we cannot stop here and we need to always improve because like every part of Italy, Milan is full old buildings that need to be made more accessible.CultureView image in fullscreenMaurizio Cattelan’s L.O.V.E. artwork outside Milan’s stock exchange.Photograph: Eden Breitz/AlamyObviously, Milan is well known for its culture and museums but there are plenty of hidden gems, too. One of them is the L.O.V.E. statue by Maurizio Cattelan, a contemporary visual artist. This statue in front of Milan’s stock exchange is a giant middle finger, and not many tourists go to see it. It’s interesting: it’s made of marble but is so different to classical buildings. It’s as if it’s saying, “screw you” to the Milan stock exchange building, which was built during theVentennio(Italy’s fascist dictatorship).There are many other museums that I love, such as theMudec, the Museum of the Cultures of Milan. TheMuseum of Natural Historyis tiny but it’s in a beautiful building in a beautiful park. At the weekend it’s crowded with kids. I used to be one of those kids, I’d go there all the time. Outside they have lifesize models of dinosaurs. It’s amazing to think they used to roam on the land that became Milan back in the day.Laura Coffey was a guest ofCrowne Plaza Milan CityandYesMilanoExplore more on these topicsMilan holidaysA local's guideItaly holidaysFood and drinkCity breaksEurope holidaysWinter sports holidaysShort breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Two years later, theCranston inquirywas set up to investigate the catastrophic event.Many of those who lost their lives were young people. Four others missing since themass drowninghave never been found. Their bereaved parents and other immediate family members provided statements to the inquiry about their loved ones.After the pen portraits were heard by the inquiry, Sir Ross Cranston, its chair, said: “It is important that we gave voice to those who are so deeply affected by the tragedy.”Here is what the inquiry heard about the victims.People who diedKazhal Ahmed Khidir al-Jammoor, 46, and her children Hadiya Rizghar Hussein, 22, Mubin Rizghar Hussein, 16, and Hasti Rizghar Hussein, sevenView image in fullscreenKazhal with her children Hadiya, Mubin and Hasti.Hadiya and Mubin spoke “perfect English” and “wanted to follow their dreams in another country”, Kazhal’s husband, Rizghar Hussein, said in a statement to the inquiry.

The family left Kurdistan, Iraq, in August 2021 and Rizghar’s last conversation was with Hadiya at 8pm GMT on 23 November 2021. “Sadness has overtaken my life,” he said. “I cannot see any happiness any more and I am just learning to accept that I will probably feel like this until I die.”Rezhwan Yassin Hassan, 19View image in fullscreenRezhwan was a top student at his school, his father told the inquiry.Hassan died just over a month after he left Kurdistan. In a statement, his father, Yassin Hassan Hamad, said: “Rezhwan was a kind and clever young man. He loved spending time with people and was always respectful. He was one of the top students at his school. His last contact with his son was at 6pm on 23 November, just hours before he died. “The pain will never go away because nothing can resolve the pain of losing a child.”Mohammed Qader Awla, 18View image in fullscreenAwla left a voicemail message for his father just before he died, the inquiry heard.Awla left Kurdistan about two months before he died. In a statement to the inquiry, his father, Qader Awla, said: “He called me when he was on the boat. He left a voice message that he was OK and that he was almost there. He said he would hopefully call me later. The sorrow in my heart will be with me for the rest of my life until my dying day.”Shakar Ali Pirot, 30View image in fullscreenShakar had a degree in geology but was unable to forge a career in Kurdistan, Iraq.Pirot was “very calm” and a “good listener and a good person”, his brother, Shamal Ali Pirot, said in a statement. Pirot had graduated from the University of Sulaimani in Iraq with a degree in geology in 2014, but his attempts to get a job as a geologist in the oil industry failed. He left the Kurdistan region of Iraq in September 2021. He left a voice note for his family on the night of the mass drowning, saying: “If you do not hear from us, we have arrived in the UK.”His brother added: “We are sad because if Shakar saw a future here in Kurdistan he would not have left.”Serkawt Pirot Mohammed, 29View image in fullscreenMohammed, who liked playing football, was buried next to his friend Shakar Ali Pirot.Mohammed was known by his nickname, Harem.

He left Kurdistan on 12 July 2021. “The whole family has been destroyed by this as we have lost an enormous part of our lives.”Muslim Ismael Hamad, 19Hamad’s father, Ismael Hamad Khudhur, said in a statement that his son was “a beautiful boy” who was sporty and a good swimmer. He said Hamad, who loved school and dreamed of becoming a doctor or an engineer, “touched many hearts in his short life”.Hamad’s bedroom has remained untouched since the day he left home, with his things exactly as he left them. “Muslim’s dreams, as well as mine, died with him that night in the Channel,” his father said.Afrasia Ahmed Mohamed Akoi, 27View image in fullscreenAkoi was very smart, his father said.Akoi left Kurdistan on 26 October 2021.

Mohammedameen planned to travel to the UK so that she could live with him. Her phone was switched off a couple of days before she attempted to cross the Channel, so her family were unable to speak to her beforehand.Mhabad Ali Ahmed, 32View image in fullscreenAhmed’s mother told the inquiry she was consumed by thoughts of her daughter waiting for help.Ahmed’s mother, Bayan Hemedemin Saleh Ahmed, said in a statement to the inquiry: “She was warm and open-hearted and cared deeply about everyone around her. As an adult, Mhabad was a wonderful person; kind, patient, loving and extremely beautiful. People who met her would always comment on her calm, serene presence.” She added that Ahmed was a wonderful mother to her children.“During the night of 23 to 24 November 2021, Mhabad sent me a photograph of herself on the boat. I did not see this photograph until later on in the day on 24 November. This was the first time I became aware that Mhabad had left France for the UK.“I now understand that by the time I saw the photograph, Mhabad was likely already dead.“In the weeks that followed, I would listen to old voice notes Mhabad sent in September over and over again, just so I could hear her voice. It breaks my heart to think of her alone and frightened waiting in ice-cold water for help which would never come.“I am consumed by the thought that my precious daughter waited for help for so long that her organs stopped working because of the cold. I think about how her life could have been saved and how her children could have grown up with their mother.”Mohammed Hussein Mohammedie, 19In a statement to the inquiry, Mohammedie’s father, Hussein Mohammedie, said his son’s body was returned to him on what would have been his 20th birthday. He described him as a “special child”, and said he always did what he was asked to do. He said he spoke to one of the two survivors of the mass drowning, a Kurdish man, shortly after it happened.“The survivor said that people in the water started taking their lifejackets off. Because of the cold and the pain, they wanted to sink and die. But not my son, he wanted to live. I was told by the survivor that my son was the last one alive before they rescued the survivor. He told me that if they had rescued him half an hour sooner then my son would be alive. If that’s right, what the survivor told me, this I cannot bear and can never forgive.”Sirwan Alipour, 23View image in fullscreenAlipour was a mechanic who was very funny and had a lot of friends, his brother said.Alipour left Sardasht, Iran, on 11 September 2021. His brother Saman Alipour said in a statement that he loved football and had a job as a mechanic.“He was very funny, always making jokes and he had a lot of friends,” he said. “Nothing we can do will bring my brother back. But what I can do now is ask people to look at migrants seeking a better life as humans.”Fikiru Shiferaw Tekalegn, 43Tekalegn’s wife, Emebet Kefyalew, said in her statement: “He said he had to leave in October 2021 because his life was at risk. I missed a call from him later that night and then received a voice note at 12.12am Ethiopian time, saying: ‘We have already boarded the boat. We are on the way. I will turn off my phone now. Goodnight, I will call you tomorrow morning.’“My daughter and Fikiru were best friends. She was a real daddy’s girl. They would go everywhere together. She still remembers so much about him and is always telling stories about the things that they used to do together.“Fikiru was such a humble and kind person. He was a people pleaser and he had a kind heart. He loved his family so much and he would never have left us if he had not felt threatened in Ethiopia.“I hope those who are responsible will understand how serious this is and understand that the people on that boat were humans as much as anyone else.”Niyat Ferede Yeshiwendim, 22Yeshiwendim grew up with her family in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. Her mother, Freweyni Hayiemariam Gitet, said she studied to be a pharmacist at Sheba University College in Mekelle and hoped to establish her own pharmacy after graduating. Two years into her studies, war started between the Ethiopian federal government and Tigray People’s Liberation Front. Due to the cutting off of internet and other communications during the conflict, her family were not immediately aware that Yeshiwendim had travelled to France. She was buried in Lille but her family want to bring her body back to Tigray.“We were not able to repatriate her body at the time because of the war in Tigray and we decided to have her laid to rest in France. It is too much to bear that we lost our daughter because she was trying to find somewhere safe. We lost her because of this war. She tried to escape so she could survive.”Meron Hailu Gebrehiwet, 25View image in fullscreenGebrehiwet launched a successful juice bar with her sister before war broke out in the region.Her brother Tesfahun Hailu Gebrehiwet said that before the Tigray conflict started, Gebrehiwet was living a happy life. “She was a beautiful woman,” he said.She studied computer science at Addis Ababa University, but left in her third year without graduating because she wanted to set up a business.She and her sister opened a juice bar, serving fresh fruit juice and milkshakes. The business was successful until the Tigray conflict started in 2020.“We saw total destruction of buildings, homes and lives completely destroyed. The whole region was a battlefield with constant gunfire, overturned cars, crying and bullets,” said Tesfahun. Gebrehiwet left Ethiopia in October 2021.She is buried next to Niyat Ferede Yeshiwendim in Lille. “It is our wish that her body is returned to Ethiopia,” said her brother.Halima Mohammed Shikh, 33Shikh left Somalia in 2019 due to political instability and violence, her brother said.In a statement to the inquiry, her brother Abdullahi Mohamud Hassan said Shikh, who had three children, left the Somali capital, Mogadishu, in 2019 due to political instability and violence. He said that his cousin, Ali Areef, spoke to the Somali survivor Issa Mohamed Omar, who told him that he was with Shikh in the water until she died and that he heard her shouting: “Help me, I don’t want to die.” She was not able to swim.He said: “Halima was a good person with a good character. She was loved by those around her and was kind to everyone.” He added that although he can legally take a ferry across the Channel from France to UK, he will never do so again. “It makes me feel sick to think about crossing the Channel in a ferry where others, including a member of my family, lost their lives because there was no other way to cross.”Relatives for these people did not provide statements to the inquiryHusain Tanha, 24Mohammed Naeem Mayar, 46Shahwali Kochy, 26Didar Ahmad, 27Mohamed Ali Mohamed Hassan Elsaey, 20Le Van Hau, 29, who is believed to have been one of the passengersMissingPshtiwan Rasul Farkha Hussein, 18View image in fullscreenHussein owned a small business selling vegetables by the age of 15, his father said.Hussein’s father, Rasul Farkha Hussein, made a statement to the inquiry explaining that his son left school aged nine to try to earn money to support the family and in particular to pay for the surgery his sister needed due to a heart defect. By the age of 15, he owned a small business selling vegetables.“If a young family was struggling, he would bring them milk and fruit to help them. It brought him peace to help others.” He added: “Sometimes I wish we had all died from hunger rather than let Pshtiwan leave.”He believes that his son is still alive.“He was in cold water surrounded by dead people for so long it may be the case that he has lost his mind and doesn’t know that he should call his parents. If someone finds him and he contacts us, our lives would be saved and filled with joy. I am hoping the Cranston inquiry will find Pshtiwan because I know he is alive somewhere. Only when we hear his voice again will we find peace.”Twana Mamand Mohammed, 18View image in fullscreenMohammed’s body was never recovered.His older brother Zana Mamand Mohammed said Mohammed was slim, tall and energetic and spent most of his time exercising, going to the gym, playing football and practising Taekwondo. He was a black belt and “the best performer in Hajiawa”, his town in Kurdistan, Iraq.He spoke to Mohammed when he was on the boat: “Twana told me there were no problems, that I should go to sleep because it was late in Kurdistan. Neither the British nor the French authorities ever contacted me about finding Twana’s body. I desperately wish there was a way to find Twana’s body. This would at least bring some peace to my mother, my father my siblings and myself after this tragedy.”Zanyar Mustafa Mina, 20Mina’s father, Mustafa Mina Nabi, said in a statement to the inquiry that his son was a kind person who always wanted to help people and that he loved football and swimming.“Zanyar sent me a message at 8.34pm Iraqi time saying: ‘I am leaving now.’ I never heard from him again.”He said he would like to come to France or England to search for his son. “Sometimes I still believe he could be in a hospital or a prison somewhere.“I believe the pain for us is greater than for those who have had the bodies of their loved ones returned, as at least they have been able to provide their loved ones with a resting place and are able to have some sort of closure.”Gomaa Gaber Mohamed Ahmed Nada, 42Nada’s relatives did not provide a statement to the inquiry.SurvivorsIssa Mohamed OmarView image in fullscreenOmar participated in the inquiry, where he gave evidence.Mohammed Shekha AhmadExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumMigrationIraqKurdsEthiopiaAfghanistanIranfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet the latest release ofJeffrey Epstein filesshows that he exchanged hundreds of friendly texts with the wealthy financier, discussing politics, travel and other topics.One of the biggest surprises in the files was abizarre videoin whichEpstein– who exploited and abused dozens of young girls – is interviewed by Bannon at what appears to be Epstein’s New York home.In an esoteric, meandering conversation over nearly two hours, the men discuss economics – Bannon is a formerGoldman Sachs investment banker– and philosophy as well as Epstein’s time in jail. They evidently paused filming just before the halfway point and then resumed, as Epstein’s glasses and shirt suddenly changed appearance.There is an easy familiarity between the two men that allows Bannon to call Epstein a “schmuck” and “criminal” and even ask if he is “the devil” fallen from paradise. At one point, Bannon comments: “There’s something deeply fucked up with you.”The interview also becomes an exercise in intellectual peacocking as they invoke Socrates, Isaac Newton and quantum physics but pay little attention to Epstein’s crimes. Epstein reveals himself to be a living museum of racial prejudice.Filmed around 2019, the interview was reportedly intended for a sympathetic documentary designed to polish Epstein’s tarnished reputation. Bannon has previously written and directed documentaries about topics including the financial crisis and the Clinton Foundation. Epstein was arrested in July 2019 anddied in his jail cellin August.Here are some of the most notable and strange moments from the interview:94 mins, 30 secs: human intelligence and intuitionEpstein has some views to share on gender and race and it goes about as well as you would expect. He reflects on the limits of science and how it cannot describe romance.“I don’t know why I’m attracted to somebody – I don’t know,” he tells Bannon. “People are attracted to each other and some – everyone – has the same feeling. They’ve seen someone walk in the room and they say, oh, that person gives me a creepy feeling.”0:59'I don’t know why I’m attracted to somebody': Epstein gives views on intuition and gender – videoScience cannot describe what such a “creepy feeling” means, he continues, adding that women have an “intuitive sense”. He goes on: “They have feelings and they’re able to deal in the realm of things that men, especially men like myself, find unexplainable.“Women have intuition. Men see things a bit differently. Men want to measure everything. Women are not really that interested in measuring.”97 mins: racismEpstein is also eager to prove that he is not a racist. He says: “You know, there’s this argument that I reject that Black people are less intelligent than white people. It’s not true.“We know, for example, that if I was in the forest and I had to run from the lion or figure out a way not to be eaten, and my competition is a local African, I’m the one who’s getting eaten. Because they have the intelligence to deal with their local environment.“So it’s just different. It’s not better, it’s not worse. But there’s many differences amongst different types of people, and people have different intelligences and they excel in some intelligences usually and less so in others.”2 mins, 30 secs: the path to global influenceEpstein outlines his ascent from a trader at Bear Stearns to a member of elite international boards. He attributes this rise to a fundamental shift in how power was perceived in the late 20th century.Epstein argues that until the mid-1970s, “name” and “reputation” (such as being a Rockefeller or head of General Motors) were the primary markers of brilliance. But with the advent of the calculator and statistical modelling, business shifted from character-based decisions to mathematical calculations.Epstein was brought on to theRockefeller Universityboard in the late 1980s specifically for his “financial expertise” to help balance statistical portfolio management for the prestigious research institution.He also describes his induction into theTrilateral Commission– a nongovernmental forum aiming to foster closer cooperation among the US, western Europe and Japan – founded by David Rockefeller, whose philosophy was that elected politicians are transient whereas businessmen provide the “stability and consistency” needed to run the world.Epstein highlights his own perceived outsider status by noting that while leaders likeBill Clintonand Paul Volcker had long biographies, he listed himself simply as “Jeffrey Epstein, just a good kid”.LA officials call on 2028 Olympics chair to resign over Ghislaine Maxwell emailsRead more68 mins: science, the soul and ethicsTowards the end of the interview, Epstein moves into more abstract territory, questioning the utility of science and the nature of humanity. Despite his background in mathematics, Epstein expresses a firm belief in the soul.He calls the soul the “dark matter of the brain” ⁠–⁠ something that cannot be seen but whose effects are obvious. He references Leibniz and Schrödinger, arguing that science cannot explain why material substance is able to “think” or what differentiates a living body from a dead one.116 mins, 20 secs: the ethics of ‘dirty money’Bannon challenges Epstein on whether institutions should accept money from a “tier-one sexual predator”, stating: “Tier one is the highest and worst.” Epstein points out: “No, the lowest. I’m the lowest.” Bannon accepts: “OK, tier one, you’re the lowest. But a criminal.”Epstein defends his philanthropy, such as for polio vaccines in Pakistan, by arguing that the mothers of vaccinated children would not care about the source of the money: “The devil himself said: ‘I’m going to exchange some dollars for your child’s life?’”1:43'Do you think you're the devil himself': Epstein defends philanthropy in Bannon interview – videoBannon asks pointedly: “Do you think you’re the devil himself?” Epstein shoots back: “No. But I do have a good mirror.”Bannon presses: “It’s a serious question. Do you think you’re the devil himself?” Taken aback by the line of questioning, Epstein replies: “I don’t know. Why would you say that?”15 mins, 30 secs: global finance and illiteracyA recurring theme in the interview is Epstein’s disdain for the financial acumen of world leaders and the general public.He claims most political leaders are “popular” but lack a fundamental “underpinning” of finance. “In some of the African countries, they might have been a disc jockey, or in our country, they would have been an actor,” he says. “They make errors because they view national or institutional finances through the lens of a personal chequing account.”In one long and rambling answer, he asks his interviewer to imagine a “Bannon bank” to illustrate a point: “The way our system works is if you as a bank are holding my dollar, you can lend out an additional eight or nine dollars.”Epstein runs through various financial concepts: fractional reserve banking, a system where a bank holding $1 can lend out $8 or $9, which Epstein calls “impossible to believe” for the average person. Epstein views cashflow as the “blood” of the financial system; if liquidity dries up, the system “dies” regardless of other metrics.Epstein says: “Not only do world leaders not understand banking but the man on the street, my father who worked in the park department, it would be beyond his imagination that people could lend out more money than they actually had in their pocket.”61 mins: the Santa Fe Institute and complexity theoryEpstein funded theSanta Fe Institutein the early 1990s with the goal of “mathematising” complex systems. His goal was to see if “strange things” (unexplainable phenomena in physics and finance) could be described by formulas or algorithms.Epstein admits that the experiment was a “total failure”. He concludes that attempting to predict the unpredictable, like the stock market, using “genetic algorithms” is folly because these systems are inherently “miracles”, not machines.He notes that modern AI designers do not actually understand how their “neural nets” arrive at answers, paralleling the lack of understanding in the global financial system.111 mins, 40 secs: writingEpstein argues that teaching children to write may be harmful because writing forces “linear” and “narrow” patterns of thinking, whereas the greatest thinkers never wrote.He says: “The most interesting, the reason I brought up writing is one of the recent discoveries of mine with respect to Socrates, Plato and Aristotle is they never wrote anything. They spoke and people around who could write, wrote. Socrates could think.”Then, in a peculiar exchange, Bannon asks: “Jesus of Nazarethwas the same way, right? Never wrote anything.” Epstein replies: “I thought he was a carpenter.” Bannon agrees: “He was a carpenter.”Bill Gates says he ‘regrets’ knowing Epstein as ex-wife alludes to ‘muck’ in marriageRead more26 mins: watching the 2008 financial crisis from jailOn the night that Lehman Brothers went into bankruptcy in London, Epstein was in jail after pleading guilty to charges of procuring a person under 18 for prostitution and solicitation of prostitution. He would experience the 2008 financial crisis while in solitary confinement inWest Palm Beach, Florida.Bannon asks whether Epstein had a moment of awareness about how he got into that situation. Epstein replies: “No, I would just say how strange that this happens. It’s strange. I’m wearing a jumpsuit and flip-flops.”“What colour was the jumpsuit?” asks Bannon, with a journalistic detail: “Brown.” Epstein confirms that was the case. Bannon comments: “I notice I don’t see you in a lot of brown.”Epstein rejects the idea that the financial system is a machine that can be “fixed” by replacing parts. Instead, he views the 2008 crisis as a biological system failure.He characterises the crash as a combination of the “blood” (liquidity) drying up and the “head” (central bank) failing to function. Just as a patient might feel “dizzy” before a stroke but cannot predict the exact moment of collapse, Epstein argues the financial system is a complex system that collapses once it hits a “limit”.0:50Jeffrey Epstein tells Steve Bannon he was in jail during 2008 financial crash – videoEpstein explicitly names Bill Clinton as the primary cause of the 2008 crisis, rejecting the standard blame placed on derivatives or the banks. He argues Clinton pushed homeownership to “get votes”, forcing banks to lend to“subprime” borrowers(people with poor credit).Epstein claims the term “subprime” was used to mask judgmental terms like “bad credit”. Moving from valuing mortgages at cost to valuing them at “what they would be worth if sold tomorrow” caused bank balance sheets to collapse overnight.Bannon, who would himself spend time in prison in 2024 but has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, seems fascinated by the austerity of life inside: a steel bed, collect calls, no access to books or newspapers. Epstein points out he did have extraAlmond Joy bars.66 mins: refusing to take responsibilityBannon asks again whether Epstein had contemplated how he had fallen from a pinnacle to end up in jail, but the interviewee repeatedly refuses to take responsibility for his crimes.Bannon asks: “It never struck you about how to end up in a situation like this?” Epstein says: “No, that would be, probably mean I would be too self-aware.” Bannon answers: “You can’t possibly expect me to believe this.” Epstein responds: “I know. I don’t believe it.”Later, Bannon insists: “You cannot tell me sometime during that day you did not have that conversation with yourself of how the fuck did I do this to myself?” Epstein avoids a direct answer but describes his life as “incredible”. Bannon asks whether he considers himself a stoic and Epstein replies: “No, I consider myself a hermit. Stoics are not very happy.”21 mins, 15 secs: Bannon and populist politicsBannon mostly sticks to his role of interviewer and never mentions Trump, who was president at the time. But at one point, as Epstein is discussing the global economy, Bannon does touch on anti-establishment, anti-elite sentiment that he has often linked to Trump’s ascent.“This is what’s stunning for all the little guys out there, the populist movement, the little guys that haven’t had a pay raise in 30 years, they think that these elites, you know, have everything,” he says.“The guys in the room making the decisions, the party of Davos guys. You’re sitting there. You don’t think many people today really understand the complexity and really all the moving pieces and how they interconnect of the world’s financial system?”107 mins: the measure of manBannon: Let’s go back to human life. When do you think human life starts?Epstein: So you see, this is the question. You’re asking me to measure something. Again, it can’t be measured.Bannon: You just hate making commitments.Epstein: That’s why I’m not married.Bannon: I’m peeling this onion back a layer at a time. All your bullshit and happy target can’t be measured. Can’t be measured like that. Is that to say measure makes? It’s a commitment. You don’t even like a commitment. When you answer a question, as they say in golf, commit to the shot.Epstein: I don’t know what it means to be measured.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinSteve BannonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They took away my second wife with some three (daughters). They are with them presently in the bush.”View image in fullscreenUmar Bio Salihu, head of the village of Woro, said the attackers also took away his second wife and three daughters.Photograph: Light Oriye Tamunotonye/AFP/Getty ImagesSalihu survived by hiding in a house, then fled to the neighbouring town of Kaiama, where he has a home, after the attackers left. The attack lasted until 3am, he said. “When the day breaks, the corpses we see, it’s too much,” he said.Woro, a village of several thousand people, sits near a forest region known as a hideout for jihadist fighters and armed gangs.Footage broadcast by local news stations after the attacks on Woro and the neighbouring village of Nuku showed bodies lying in blood on the ground, some with their hands tied, and burning houses.Details are still emerging from the attack, the country’s deadliest so far this year. According to the Red Cross, the death toll stands at 162 people, and the search for bodies is ongoing.Salihu said the jihadists had sent a letter saying they were coming to the village to preach, and went on the rampage when no one attended. Residents separately told Reuters that the attackers had long preached in the village, urging locals to abandon the Nigerian state and adopt sharia rule.The Nigerian president Bola Tinubu has condemned the “beastly attack”, deployed an army battalion to the troubled region, and blamed the Islamist extremistBoko Harammovement – though the name is often used generically for jihadist groups in Nigeria.Nigeria mapThe attack – described by Amnesty International’s Nigeria office as “a stunning security failure” – was the latest in a series of repeated and widespread acts of violence by jihadists and other armed groups in Nigeria. The country is experiencing a jihadist insurgency in the north-east and north-west, as well as a surge in looting and kidnapping for ransom by armed groups known as “bandits” in the north-west and north-central regions.Experts say that Kwara is fast becoming a new frontier for armed groups seeking to expand in Africa’s most populous country. James Barnett, a researcher at the Washington-based Hudson Institute, told Associated Press armed groups have been going farther afield because they are finding a lot of competition from rival groups in the areas where they traditionally operated.The armed groups in Nigeria include at least two affiliated with Islamic State: an offshoot of Boko Haram known as the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), and the lesser-known Islamic State Sahel Province, known locally as Lakurawa.View image in fullscreenA motorcyclist rides past a burnt truck after the attacks in Woro. The Red Cross puts the death toll at 162 people.Photograph: Light Oriye Tamunotonye/AFP/Getty ImagesThe military has in the past said the Lakurawa has its roots in neighbouring Niger and that it became more active in Nigeria’s border communities after a 2023 military coup. Kwara borders Niger state, which is targeted increasingly by armed groups and is a hotspot where ISWAP and other armed groups have stepped up village attacks and mass kidnappings.Insecurity in Nigeria has been under intense scrutiny in recent months since the US president, Donald Trump,alleged that there was a “genocide” against Christiansin the country. The claim has been rejected by the Nigerian government and many independent experts, who say the country’s security crises claim the lives of Christians and Muslims, often without distinction.Elsewhere on Tuesday, unknown gunmen killed at least 13 people in Doma village in the north-western state of Katsina, a police spokesperson said.Agence France-Presse, Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricaBoko HaramnewsShareReuse this content"

The Cuban government has found itself facing mounting threats of regime change from US officials, particularly since the 3 January US military capture ofNicolás Maduro, the president of Venezuela and the island’s traditional ally.On Sunday, Trump suggested that talks were already under way, telling reportings: “Cuba is a failing nation. It has been for a long time but now it doesn’t haveVenezuelato prop it up. So we’re talking to the people from Cuba, the highest people in Cuba, to see what happens.“I think we’re going to make a deal withCuba.”Last month, Trump signed an executive order threatening to imposeadditional tariffson countries that sell oil to Cuba, and he later claimed that Mexico had agreed to halt shipments of oil at his request – a claim the Mexican president,Claudia Sheinbaum, has rejected.On Thursday Reuters reported that an oil tanker that has previously transported Venezuelan fuel to Cuba had finished loading a 150,000-barrel cargo of gasoline, in a possible sign that the South American country could be preparing to send supplies to the island.Cuba on the brink as Trump turns up the pressure: ‘There is going to be a real blockade’Read moreBut Cuba’s government is preparing the population for hardships beyond those already apparent. The island is already amid an economic slump that has seen people begging on the streets and rooting through bins for food. In recent years, hyper-inflation has slashed state salaries and pensions. Widespread power outages continued on Thursday, with reports that the whole east region of the island was offline.Díaz-Canel said he had received messages from the presidents of China andRussia, along with many others from all over the world. “They expressed their support, commitment and determination to continue collaboration and cooperation with Cuba and Venezuela,” he saidHowever, a Havana-based businessman who has worked with the Cuban government for more than 25 years, said: “They are out of options. There are strong rumours of talks already under way in Mexico.”In his speech, Díaz-Canel said: “The energy persecution, the financial persecution, the intensification of the blockade with these coercive measures is such that we know we have to do a very strong, very creative, very intelligent job to overcome all these obstacles.”We are going to take measures that, while not permanent, will require effort.”And in interviews preceding the statement, other government ministers made it clear what that meant.“It’s not easy,” the deputy foreign minister, Carlos Fernández de Cossío, told the news agency Efe. “It’s difficult for the government and very difficult for the population as a whole.”Explore more on these topicsCubaDonald TrumpChinaRussiaVenezuelaNicolás MaduroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

More than 400 officers, including from York, Toronto and the Ontario provincial police, have been involved in the Project South investigation.Ryan Hogan, deputy chief of York region, said the investigation began in June 2025 after an attempt to murder a corrections officer working at a Toronto jail.“Over a 36-hour period, a number of suspects attended [the victim’s] home in York region, we allege for the purpose of murdering him,” he said. At the press conference, police showed surveillance footage in which three armed and masked men went to the officer’s home and rammed a police cruiser that was in the driveway.Tow truck turf wars: Toronto sees rise in violence likened to organised crimeRead moreHogan said police officers unlawfully collected personal and private information, passing it on to members of organized crime, “which ultimately resulted in serious harm in our communities”. He called the inquiry the “most complex and challenging investigations” in a career spanning nearly three decades.Seven civilians, including three accused in the murder plot, and four other men with suspected links to international organized crime, were also charged.One of the men, Brian Da Costa, was allegedly involved in a “sophisticated” drug-trafficking operation. “When police officers arrested Mr Da Costa on January 23 of this year, officers seized 169 pounds of cannabis and one pound of fentanyl, which we believe was destined outbound for a European location,” said Hogan.Hogan said officers were alleged to have given “protection” to suspects accused of trafficking fentanyl and cannabis, and stole personal property from a police facility – including driver’s licences, passports and health cards.Police acknowledged the investigation, which led to at least 30 arrests, also involved the tow-truck industry,which has increasingly become engulfedby gun violence, turf wars and links to organized crime.View image in fullscreenScreengrab from a Toronto police helicopter infrared camera of an incident.Photograph: Toronto PoliceDemkiw said the case against the officers was of an “incredible magnitude” and was without precedent in his time as leader of the Toronto police. In 2012, five Toronto officers with the drug squad were found guilty of obstructing justice after falsifying notes related to a warrantless search.“Our top responsibility is to undertake the hard work of honest examination, to look critically at how this occurred, to identify the weaknesses and to address them in a way that upholds the trust placed in the Toronto police,” he said. “Organized crime is corrosive, that it infected our service is unacceptable, but these allegations are not representative of over 8,000 members.”Hogan said police would revisit cases the officers worked on to determine if the accused directed or foiled the outcome of investigations.Four officers charged have been suspended without pay.“As a professional labour organization, we will ensure our members receive due process and wellness support as required,” the police union said in a statement. “We have no further comment regarding this investigation or the members involved.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In the early hours of Wednesday, the 54-year-old was reportedly detained by members of the Bolivarian national intelligence service (Sebin) at a luxury home in Venezuela’s capital, Caracas.Raúl Gorrín, a billionaire media mogul who owns the Globovisión TV channel, was also reportedly detained at the same address.There was no immediate confirmation of the arrests from Venezuela’s government but a US official told Reuters Saab had been detained as a result of collaboration between US and Venezuelan authorities. The official said they expected Saab to be extradited to the US in the coming days.However, Saab’s lawyer, Luigi Giuliano, called reports of his client’s detention “fake news” andtold Colombia’s El Espectadornewspaper that he was “doing fine in Caracas”. A representative for Gorríntold the New York Timesthat the businessman was free as of Wednesday evening.Intelligence sourcestold the Colombian radio station Caracolthat Saab, who had served as minister for industry and national production under Maduro, was taken into custody at about 2am and was being held at the intelligence service’s detention centre.Saab’s supposed detention was the latest twist in the life of the Barranquilla-born businessman, who came to be known as one of the most important financial operators of Maduro’s Chavista political movement.In 2019, Saab was indicted in the US for allegedly being part of a corruption racket in which about $350m of government money was transferred out of Venezuelaand into accounts he owned or controlled.The following year, Saab was arrested after landing in Cape Verde while flying to Iran and, after a protracted legal battle, extradited to the US in 2021 to be charged with money laundering. He was the subject of sanctions in the UK for plundering resources destinedfor public programmesdesigned to feed and house poverty stricken Venezuelans.However, in December 2023, Saab – who has denied the charges against him – was released as part of a prisoner swap deal with the Biden administration.He returned to Venezuela and in 2024 Maduro made his ally a minister – a position he was stripped of on 16 January by Maduro’s former number two, the country’s interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez.Early last month Saab, who is widely seen as a Rodríguez rival, was accused of contracting a series of “shadow fleet” oil tankers that attempted to evade a US naval blockade Trump had ordered to prevent vessels leaving Venezuelan ports with cargoes of oil thought to be bound for China and Russia.Venezuela plan to turn notorious prison into cultural centre scrubs past horrors, critics sayRead moreSaab’s reported detention was a reminder of how volatile the political situation remains in Venezuela one month after Maduro’s downfall upended the country’s authoritarian political landscape.Trump has claimed that the US is “running” the South American country after January’s special forces raid and has warned that Rodríguezcould face a worse fate than Maduroif she fails to do Washington’s bidding.Since taking power, Rodríguez has removed several members of Maduro’s cabinet and security apparatus, including the head of presidential security and the minister of communication and information.However, other key names in the Chavismo movement remain in power, including the feared interior minister Diosdado Cabello, who controls Venezuela’s security forces and paramilitary groups.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroAmericasTrump administrationFBInewsShareReuse this content"

But activists have criticised the plan as an attempt to rehabilitate a symbol of Venezuela’s collapse – and erase the regime’s long history of repression.Downward spiral: how Venezuela’s symbol of progress became political prisoners’ hellRead more“The horrors committed at El Helicoide have already been sufficiently documented and exposed by numerous human rights organisations and by a United Nations mission,” said Martha Tineo, coordinator of the NGO Justicia, Encuentro y Perdón (Justice, Encounter and Forgiveness, or JEP), one of the groups that have for years supported political prisoners and their families.“We welcome the fact that it will be shut down – but not so that it can be turned into some kind of social or recreation centre,” Tineo said.Activists argue the site should instead be turned into a space of memory, along the lines of the former Escuela de Mecánica de la Armada (Esma) in Buenos Aires, a torture centre under Argentina’s military dictatorshipwhich is now a museum. That would offer “a form of reparation for victims by telling the truth and ensuring that these horrors are not repeated”, Tineo said.View image in fullscreenPeople attend a vigil to demand the freedom of political prisoners allegedly held in El Helicoide in Caracas on 17 January 2026.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesNamed after its spiralling, brutalist concrete structure, the building was conceived in the 1950s to project an image of modernity fuelled by oil wealth during the military dictatorship of Marcos Pérez Jiménez, but it was abandoned after he was overthrown in 1958.In the 1970s it became a temporary shelter for thousands left homeless by devastating landslides, but the overcrowded structure soon became notorious for drug trafficking and crime. In the 1980s, the families were moved out, and it was used as the headquarters for the domestic intelligence service.Under Chávez, El Helicoide became a detention centre for political prisoners held by the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (Sebin).Repression intensified under Maduro, andreportsdocumentedpractices of torture including electric shocks, beatings, suffocation and prolonged bans on family visits. In recent years, El Helicoide and Sebin were under the direct command of Rodríguez.Engineer and activist Angel Godoy, 52, spent nine months in El Helicoide last year. Although he says he was not tortured there, he was unable to contact his family for the first three months.He was arrested in the regime’s crackdown after the opposition organised a nationwide effort to collect voting records andprove that it had won the 2024 election– even though Maduro nevertheless declared himself the victor.His organisation had trained citizens to monitor the electoral process. “They saw this as a major threat and came after us,” said Godoy, who was charged with terrorism, incitement to hatred and to armed action.Three months ago, he was transferred from El Helicoide to Yare prison, which is also notorious for its overcrowding and dire conditions. When he was released on 14 January, after 372 days behind bars, Godoy left behind all his few belongings for his cellmates: sandals, a toothbrush, toiletries and some food.“When the guards shouted my name, my fellow inmates began shouting, ‘Freedom, freedom!’ As I walked out, they told me to fight for them and not to forget them,” Godoy said.Like dozens of others released since the US attack, Godoy was not granted full liberty: although, unlike others, he has not been barred from giving press interviews, he must still report to court every 30 days and is prohibited from leaving the country.Activistsestimatethat between 600 and 800 political prisoners remain behind bars, even after Rodríguezannouncedher intention to send an “amnesty” bill to congress.“I think I will only truly be free when each and every one of my fellow prisoners is out of those unjust cells,” Godoy said.While no date has been set for a vote, the bill is expected to pass easily in the national assembly, which is dominated by regime loyalists.A main concern of activists is that, according to the acting president, those convicted of crimes such as homicide will be excluded. Yet among political prisoners are many accused of never-proven allegations of supposedassassination plotsagainst Maduro.JEP’s coordinator, Tineo, also argues that these people must be compensated for being wrongfully imprisoned for crimes they did not commit, and that political prisoners, former detainees – many of whom died in custody – their families and civil society organisations must take part in the discussion of the amnesty bill.A new oil industry law, approved last week, has drawn thesame criticismover a lack of transparency and public debate, reinforcing the view among critics that Rodríguez’s administration represents a form ofChavismo 3.0.“Trying to carry on as things were in the past would amount to confirmation that there is no real will for change from the government,” Tineo said.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaDelcy RodríguezAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The US must handle the issue of arms sales to Taiwan with prudence.”Hours later, the self-ruled island’s president, Lai Ching-te, said ties with the US were “rock solid”.“The Taiwan-US relationship is rock solid, and all cooperation projects will continue uninterrupted,” Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, told reporters during a visit to textile merchants in western Taiwan on Thursday.Taiwan is a self-ruled democracy that China claims as its own territory, to be annexed by force if necessary.

The package is yet to be approved by Congress.Chinareacted angrily to the proposed arms sales, conductingtwo days of military drillsaround the island in late December, for which it dispatched air, navy and missile units.The arms sales are also facing pushback from Taiwan’s opposition KMT party and some of its population, along with a proposed increase of defense spending to 3.3% of Taiwan’s gross domestic product.Taiwan’s opposition-controlled parliament has blocked Lai’s budget plan, including a $40bn special defense budget, proposing instead a much smaller defense spending plan.Late on Wednesday, Trump had said the call with Xi – which covered topics including Taiwan’s future – was “excellent” and “thorough” in a post on Truth Social.The call also covered Russia’s war in Ukraine, “the current situation with Iran” and China buying oil and gas from the US, Trump wrote in the post.He added that he was looking forward to a trip to China in April that will be the first of his current term in office.Trump also said China was considering buying 20m tons of US soya beans in the current season, up from 12m tons in the previous season.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificTaiwanUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

This accounted for 11.4% of China’s gross domestic product, up from 7.3% in 2022.The bar chart showing the proportion of Chinese GDP that was down to renewables sectorChina is increasingly dependent on these sectors. Without clean energy, Beijing’s leaders would have missed their 5% annual growth target by a wide margin.Most of the extra capacity is being used to meet domestic demand for a rollout of wind and solar that has recentlybeen double that in the rest of the world combined.Chinese government advisers say this is no longer just a transition of power generation, but a system-wide change in how the country is wired and made mobile. The most spectacular investment growth last year was in the battery sector, where ever more efficient technology is being used for electric vehicles (EVs) and grid storage upgrades.A bar graph showing the proportion of China’s investment growth that came from renewables sectorExports are also surging. Thanks to expanding output in the world’s manufacturing powerhouse, solar power has been credited by the International Energy Agency forproviding “the cheapest electricity in history”and is now affordable in many global south nations.“In a lot of other countries things are accelerating,” said the report’s lead author, Lauri Myllyvirta. “Many of the African countries have imported a lot of solar. EVs are just starting to be bought in places where no one had an EV breakthrough on their bingo card for last year or maybe not even this decade.”He said the uptick in clean energy investment in China was positive news.If the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases continues to move away from fossil fuels at this speed, it will soon – or possibly already has – hit peak carbon, which would mark a global turning point.But this is not yet assured. China’s coal industry is also a powerful political force and it will be contesting the speed of transition. Last year, developers submitted proposals to build a total 161 GW of new coal-fired power plants and more are in the pipeline. The future direction of the country’s energy sector should become clearer next month, when the government unveils its next five-year plan.Climate campaigners said it was time for China to make up its mind. “This is a historic turning point: solar power is set to overtake coal in China for the first time in 2026. This is maybe the clearest demonstration yet that clean energy has won – on cost, scale, and air quality,” said Andreas Sieber, the head of political strategy at 350.org.“However, China is responding to coal’s economic defeat by building more of it. With around 290 GW of new coal capacity already permitted or under construction, and another record year for approvals, the country is … proving coal is obsolete while rushing to entrench it. This mostly serves a coal industry racing against time. The consequence is predictable: stranded assets, higher system costs, and a transition made harder.”Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificEnergyElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsGreenhouse gas emissionsEthical and green livingRenewable energynewsShareReuse this content"

As the3m emails and 1,800 photos released on Friday by the US Department of Justicestart to percolate across the continent and through to national media, questions about the moral fibre of this elite are starting to be asked at markedly different levels of intensity.Squirming businessmen, bankers, politicians, royals, academics, tech bros and partners in law firms have become entangled in Jeffrey Epstein’s interlocking circles of money, power and sex. It seems there was no one in a position of power that Epstein was not in email contact with, and that there was little limit to what this networking elite was prepared to do in return for a gift, a contact or an invite to a sexually charged party. Elon Musk was right when in July 2025 he tweeted – only to quickly delete it – that “so many powerful people want that list suppressed”.It says something about Britain’s media and political culture that the most heated inquest under way about Epstein is not in the US, but in the UK, and the political leader that may first be required to resign is not Donald Trump, but the owlish and PooterishKeir Starmer.The risk in appointing Peter Mandelson to represent the UK as ambassador in the US, knowing he had been in close contact with Epstein after he had been convicted of sex offences, should have been clear, and sent warning lights flashing on any politician’s dashboard.For Starmer, a leader who has already developed a reputation for weakness in public office, this is a grievous blow. He looks as if he was either rolled over, or lacked the necessary integrity to reject the appointment.The more straightforward charge facing Mandelson is one that may see his career end not just in failure, but in jail. Epstein’s donations to Mandelson, and the business secretary’s supply of commercial sensitive information from the heart of government to Epstein are of interest to the Metropolitan police.For good measure, the judgment of Starmer’s increasingly beleaguered chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, is also in question, something will delight those Labour MPs that have long disliked McSweeney for his pursuit of the Reform vote. Those on Labour’s soft left, and Britain’s hugely competitive press, have a powerful figure essential to Starmer in their sights.By contrast, in the US, Trump, his wife and his Mar-a-Lago club are referred to 38,000 times, but the constitutional lines of accountability to control a president seem to have long gone, while the public seem inured to Trump’s moral flaws. Steve Bannon, a close Epstein friend, also seems immune to criticism. Congress did play a role in eventually forcing Trump to release the documents, but it has shown little interest in pursuing what they show, except if it might ensnare the Clintons.The most high-profile US figure to face reprisals over his friendship with Epstein may be the former treasury secretary Larry Summers. The one-time president of Harvard University stepped back from public commitments last year saying he was “deeply ashamed” after emails with Epstein showed him making sexist remarks and asking for romantic advice.Otherwise, the gossipy fallout between the tech bros, and between Bill and Melinda Gates, has attracted the most interest. Brad Karp, the chair of Paul Weiss, one of the country’s most prominent corporate law firms, quit his post after his email exchanges with Epstein emerged.Also do not expect a hot pursuit in the Saudi press of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Photographs show him smiling and hugging Epstein. Equally, the Emirati press is likely to have little to say about the email exchanges between Epstein and Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, the head of DP World, the giant Dubai ports group.The European country most badly affected is upright Norway, where the royal family, as in the UK, is reeling. Norway’s crown princess, Mette-Marit, has come under scrutiny after documents showed years of contact with Epstein. The unsealed files contain nearly 1,000 mentions of Mette-Marit, including numerous email exchanges between 2011 and 2014. She said in a statement issued by the royal palace: “I showed poor judgment and I deeply regret having had any contact with Epstein. It is simply embarrassing.” Mette-Marit married Crown Prince Haakon in 2001.There is interest, too, in why the children of high-profile Danish diplomat couple Terje Rød-Larsen and Mona Juul were due to receive $10m in a will Epstein signed two days before he died.Børge Brende, another former Norwegian diplomat and now in charge of the World Economic Forum, is also in hot water over 100 text messages and emails including three meetings with Epstein. The extent to which he informed the WEF board of his connections is now under review. Brende said: “I was completely unaware of Epstein’s past and criminal activities.”In Sweden, Joanna Rubinstein, a biologist and president of Sweden for UNHCR (a fundraising foundation for the UN Refugee Agency) has resigned. She visited Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean with her family. “I was aware of the [2008] judgment at the time of my visit. What was subsequently revealed about the extent of the abuse is horrific, and I firmly distance myself from it,” she said.In France, Le Monde has been investigating the links between Epstein and a smattering of French celebrities, including Jack Lang, the 84-year-old former culture minister. In his case there were loans of planes and villas, and links to an offshore company in the Virgin Islands. Lang said: “I meet a lot of people; I’m drawn to the unexpected. Jeffrey was a generous man, a pleasant businessman. He loved art, cinema.”In every country and every language, there is an excuse.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinDonald TrumpKeir StarmerEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Italian opposition parties this week urged Salvini to clarify whether Epstein influenced the rise of the League after Salvini’s name was cited several times in messages exchanged between Bannon and Epstein.In France, the leftwing party La France Insoumise also called for a cross-party parliament inquiry after several French figures including Jack Lang, a former culture minister, and his daughter appeared in the latest Epstein release, as did exchanges between Epstein and Bannon in which Bannon spoke of his desire to raise money for the far-right leaderMarine Le Pen.View image in fullscreenMatteo Salvini at a League party rally in central Rome, December 2018.Photograph: Giuseppe Lami/EPAIn Germany, the files revealedexchanges between Epstein and Bannonpromoting Alternative für Deutschland while denigrating the then German chancellor, Angela Merkel.In texts from 2018, Bannonbragged about his influenceas an “adviser” to the new rightwing populists and saw the parties’ gains in Europe as a chance to use them to his and Epstein’s benefit.There is no evidence of any direct relations between Salvini and Epstein, nor any suggestion that Salvini was involved in Epstein’s sex-trafficking network. But what the messages do reveal is Epstein’s interest in European nationalists.In a message contained inone of the filesand dated 5 March 2019, a couple of months before the European parliamentary elections, Bannon writes that he is “focused on raising money for Le Pen and Salvini so they can actually run full slates”.‘Do you think you’re the devil himself?’: highlights from the bizarre, newly released Bannon-Epstein interviewRead moreOthersmessagesdetail Bannon’s travels in Europe at the time and his ambition for increased nationalist power in Brussels, as highlighted ina flurry of exchangesbetween the pair at the time of the European parliament ballot in late May 2019.The messagesalso refer to Bannon’s meeting with Salvini in Milan in March 2018, just a few days after Italian general elections that culminated in the League forming a government with the populist Five Star Movement.View image in fullscreenSteve Bannon with Marine Le Pen in March 2018.Photograph: Philippe Huguen/AFP/Getty ImagesBannon met Salvini again in Italy in September that year when the Leaguejoined his anti-EU organisation, the Movement. By the following summer, Salvini was in opposition after collapsing the League’s coalition with the Five Star Movement in a failed attempt to trigger early elections.There is no evidence that Epstein financed the League, which returned to government in 2022 as an ally in Giorgia Meloni’s ruling coalition, and other European far-right parties. However, it appears that Bannon tried to tap him for funds.Andrea Casu, a politician with the centre-left Democratic party who raised questions about the subject of funding in the Italian parliament on Tuesday, said: “We are asking the government – not just Salvini – for clarity and transparency … we must first understand if there is a link, not only with Bannon, but with those who today play a political game with these rightwing forces at the European level.”Riccardo Magi, president of the leftwing party Più Europa (More Europe), claimed the Epstein files “implicate Matteo Salvini in alleged funding that Bannon had promised to provide for his election campaign”, an allegation that “raises concerns about potential external influence affecting the second-largest party in the current majority”.Bannon has declined to comment to US media about the exchanges in the latest Epstein files. Salvini’s League party dismissed speculation that Epstein might have contributed funds as “unfounded” and “serious exaggerations”. It added that the party has “never requested or received funding” and would defend itself and Salvini “in every way possible in the event of insinuations or associations with disgusting figures”.View image in fullscreenSteve Bannon at Atreju 2018, a conference of rightwing activists, in Rome, Italy.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesInFrance, Lang, who heads the Institut du Monde Arabe, a cultural organisation, features in emails discussing meetings and holidays. He admitted knowing Epstein, saying it was “at a time when nothing suggested Jeffrey Epstein was at the heart of a network of criminality”.His daughter Caroline, a film producer, resigned this week from France’s Union of Independent Producers after the emails showed she had founded an offshore company with Epstein in 2016 to invest in the work of young artists. There was no suggestion of illegality. She said she had resigned from the company when Epstein’s criminal acts were revealed.The emails also showed extensive communications between Epstein and Olivier Colom, a former diplomatic adviser to the former rightwing president Nicolas Sarkozy. One email exchange with Colom in 2018 suggested that the former finance minister Bruno Le Maire had gone to Epstein’s house in New York at an unspecified date. A person close to Le Mairetold Politicothat Le Maire had not known whose house he was visiting in September 2013, before he was finance minister, and quickly left when he saw Epstein at the residence, never seeing him again.Casu said the issue was not Epstein’s files per se but the questions the messages raise about powerful foreign influences and the networks aimed at weakening Europe.“These files are getting a lot of attention in the US, as is obvious,” he said. “But in my opinion, they should be given just as much attention for what they represent for Europe today, and for the political situation in which we are in.”Explore more on these topicsEuropeJeffrey EpsteinSteve BannonMatteo SalviniMarine Le PenItalyFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

The man, a former truck driver from the northern Italian region of Veneto, is the first suspect to be placed under investigation since the inquiry began in November.According to reports in theItalian press, he is alleged to have bragged about “conducting a manhunt”.Milan prosecutors investigate alleged ‘sniper tourism’ during Bosnian warRead moreMore than 10,000 people were killed in Sarajevo by shelling and sniper fire between 1992 and 1996 in the longest siege in modern history, afterBosnia and Herzegovinadeclared independence from Yugoslavia.The snipers were perhaps the most feared element of life under siege because they would pick off people on the streets, including children, at random. Sarajevo is in a basin surrounded by mountains, which made cutting it off and attacking it particularly easy.Groups of Italians and people of other nationalities, so-called “sniper tourists”, are alleged to have participated in the massacre after paying large sums of money to soldiers belonging to the army of Radovan Karadžić, the former Bosnian Serb leader who in 2016was found guilty of genocideand other crimes against humanity, to be transported to the hills surrounding Sarajevo so they could shoot at people for pleasure.The investigation inItalyoriginated from a legal complaint submitted by Ezio Gavazzeni, a Milan-based writer who gathered evidence on the allegations, as well as a report sent to the prosecutors by the former mayor of Sarajevo Benjamina Karić.Gavazzeni said he had first read reports about the alleged sniper tourists in the Italian press in the 1990s, but it was not until he watchedSarajevo Safari, a 2022 documentary by the Slovenian director Miran Zupanič, that he began to investigate further.In the documentary, a former Serbian soldier and a contractor said that groups of westerners would shoot at the civilian population from the hills around Sarajevo. The claims have been vehemently denied by Serbian war veterans.Speaking to the Guardian in November, Gavazzeni said the Italian suspects would meet in the northern city of Trieste and travel to Belgrade, from where the Bosnian Serb soldiers would accompany them to the hills of Sarajevo. “There was a traffic of war tourists who went to there to shoot people,” he said. “I call it an indifference towards evil.”Probably the most high-profile deaths by sniper fire were Bošco Brkić and Admira Ismić, a couple documented in the film Romeo and Juliet in Sarajevo, who were killed by a sniper in 1993 while trying to cross a bridge. Their bodies remained in no man’s land between the Bosnian and Bosnian Serb positions for several days. Photographs were published widely and became symbolic of the randomness and inhumanity of the war.Explore more on these topicsBosnia and HerzegovinaItalySerbiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Currently, states need only register a minimum 35% of travellers, but in theory all passengers are due to complete the EES registration from 10 April.Border authorities are allowed to reduce the number or extent of checks – or even stand down the system – to avoid significant disruption and large queues.Many border crossings had the EES infrastructure up and ready well before last October’s launch, including on British soil:at Eurotunnel in Folkestoneand at Eurostar’s London St Pancras International station.View image in fullscreenEES kiosks at St Pancras International station in London.Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/GettyBut most visitors to the 29 countries introducing EES will probably register their details at border control on landing at airports. The trade body Airports Council International (ACI) has reported that the system was causing delays of up to three hours, with airports in Spain, Portugal, France and Italy among the worst affected.Olivier Jankovec, the director general of ACI Europe, said: “The chronic understaffing of all border control guards was an issue before – and the rollout of EES makes it worse. We’re routinely seeing, with only up to 35% of people coming into Schengen being registered, queues of up to two hours. It’s not sustainable and we fear it is only going to get worse.“We’re especially concerned for July and August, when we have double the traffic. We could see queues of up to five hours, and that is making us very nervous: it creates a disastrous passenger experience and a safety hazard, as well as possible missed connecting flights.”The UK travel association Abta has urged the EU to ensure all member states and border authorities have told staff on the ground to use the contingency measures to avoid long delays at passport control.Abta’s chief executive, Mark Tanzer, has written to the EU commissioner for migration, Magnus Brunner, asking him to keep the system under review and push for additional border guards at the busiest times.Tanzer said: “The ambition of a project like EES means it was never going to go completely smoothly, and we were prepared for that. However, what is frustrating is that border authorities have it within their power to ease queues and deal with issues as they arise – but that doesn’t seem to be happening across the board.”Last week a commission spokesperson said contingency measures would be available for at least 90 days from the April deadline, hinting at a possible further six-week extension to cover the summer.Jankovec said airports had “not received formal notification that the ability to suspend EES will be extended, nor the conditions required”.Queues in Lisbon airport had reached seven hours just before new year, he said, leading the Portuguese authorities to suspend the system. Many self-service kiosks for EES did not work reliably, while no state bar Sweden had allowed the use of an app to allow travellers to pre-register details.Jankovec added: “We can do a Band-Aid for the summer but we need all these things to be addressed, under a coordinated European approach.”In the UK, Eurotunnel said it had begun the phased rollout of EES for coach passengers and lorry drivers smoothly and was “fully prepared”, but had not yet started registering tourist vehicles, awaiting a date from French authorities.Eurostar, which has invested heavily in new kiosks at St Pancras, has yet to switch them on. It said EES checks were being completed manually by border officers, and it would introduce kiosk-based processing once the software and dates were set by the French interior ministry.Explore more on these topicsAir transportTravel & leisureRail transportEuropeTransportEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

More than 30 Iranian military commanders were killed, and 160 strikes on Iranian military targets undertaken.On 22 June the US, using B-2s and 30 Tomahawk missiles, hit Iran’s three major nuclear sites at Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz, eviscerating its nuclear programme. In September UN-wide sanctions were reimposed on the country after the European powers ended their objections to this step. In January Trump tightened the screw by imposing a tariff of 25% on goods from countries that trade with Iran.War, a Trump-imposed deal or internal regime collapse: for Tehran, none of the options are good | Sanam VakilRead moreAll this has had a real-world impact. Since June Iran’s currency has more than halved in value against the dollar, and food inflation is heading towards three figures. These were two of the factors that sparked the nationwide protests in January that revealed the willingness of the security services to slaughter thousands of fellow Iranians. Such is the government’s anxiety at the public mood, it is still filtering the internet more than a month after the censorship started.Iran’s diplomats are hardly behaving as if the government was last month on the brink of collapse, or even now fears a return to a conflict with the US that might bring the protesters back on to the streets for the final battle. Instead it acts as if it can dictate the parameters of the talks with the US,their venueand their main topic.Iran’s negotiators are hugely experienced and never show a trace of weakness. Anything negotiable is negotiated. “One more thing” is their favourite phrase, according to Wendy Sherman, the chief negotiator for the US nuclear deal in 2013-15. Iran’s negotiating team was legalistic, full of stamina, well prepared and tough, Sherman recalled.Nevertheless, it is surprising how confident Tehran seems that the Oman talks will not immediately collapse, and if they do that the government will survive.The simplest explanation for Iran’s hardball tactics is that the regime simply does not believe Trump will carry out his threat to attack given the perils of doing so. The reprisals by Iran on Israel and US military bases could be disproportionate, and lead to fresh tensions between Washington and the Gulf states angry that the US has destabilised the region.Hamidreza Azizi, a visiting fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, said: “There seems to be a consensus among the Islamic Republic security elite that President Trump doesn’t want prolonged and messy wars at high cost. So the only thing they have to do is to make sure that it’s going to be as unpredictable, as messy and as expensive in terms of human cost and economic cost as possible.”But there is a further explanation. Iran does not believe Trump has a strategy for change inside Iran, or any interest as yet in linking up with the opposition inside and outside Iran.It is unlikely a politician as instinctive as Trump would ever have something as elevated as theory of change in a society as complex as Iran, but the administration seems to have little idea how the political gravity on the ground might shift if the US bombs start to drop.As recently as last week Marco Rubio was disarmingly frank that the US did not have a plan. “I don’t think anyone can give you a simple answer as to what happens next in Iran if the supreme leader and the regime were to fall, other than the hope that there would be some ability to have somebody within their system that you could work towards a similar transition,” he told the Senate foreign relations committee.Comparing Iran with Venezuela, he said: “I would imagine it would be even far more complex than the one we’re describing now, because you’re talking about a regime that’s been in place for a very long time.”Supporters of Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed Shah of Iran, and other figures in the diaspora, insist a US attack can galvanise the masses to return to the streets, and despite the thousands arrested and killed, the crowds, their resolve hardened by the loss of loved ones, will be better organised and prepared.“Iranians want the regime to be bombed,” said one of Pahlavi’s closest supporters, Saeed Ghasseminejad. The security forces will, under this theory, lose the political will to commit a second massacre, especially if the Iranian government was shown to have spurned a chance to strike a nuclear deal.Other dissidents inside Iran can see the case for foreign intervention even if they would prefer if it was endorsed by the UN. The human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh told Iranwire: “As for public sentiment inside Iran, many people are waiting for this strike. Many who have been driven to the brink see it as their last hope. When a society feels completely powerless against tyranny, it begins to look outward.”Many of the strongest statements from dissidents inside Iran reject external intervention. They include those by Mir Hossein Mousavi, the former Iranian prime minister and Green Movement leader, as well as the collective known as Group of 17, including the Nobel prize winner Narges Mohammadi and Mehdi Mahmoudian, the Oscar nominated screenwriter. Mousavi, 83, who is under house arrest, said he wanted a peaceful and democratic transition of power. He is less clear how that can be achieved given the repression under way.Mahmoudian told the BBC that no patriotic Iranian would ever support an external attack on their country. He warned that war would undermine domestic democratic agency, deepen social divisions and prevent a domestic democratic transition built round a referendum.But this does not mean these opponents of foreign intervention are passive or defeatist.The statement of the 17 issued on 2 January was unequivocal in demanding change that was neither reformism or revolution. “Iran can only be saved by prosecuting those responsible for the repression, ending this inhumane system, and enabling the people to determine their political future in a democratic manner,” the statement said.Three of the 17 signatories have now been arrested on charges of helping Mousavi draft his statement. Vida Rabbani, one of the three arrested, is said to be refusing to cooperate with the authorities in jail. Mohammadi, arrested separately, says she is on hunger strike.Even longtime advisers to Pahlavi worry that the call for the population to take to the streets was a mistake.Trump, for the moment, seems to have lost interest in those in jail or seeking radical change inside Iran. That may change, however, if the Iranian negotiators overplay their hand in Oman.Explore more on these topicsIranUS foreign policyDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

His brother, David Zini, is the head of the Shin Bet, the domestic intelligence agency. He was appointed by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, last May and began the job in October.Israel has long controlled all goods going into Gaza and enforced a total blockade at the height of the war thatled to widespread famine. Smuggling was rife under blockade, and cigarettes were a luxury for the very few. At the peak of the conflict, a single cigarette could sell for $15 (£11) and a carton of 50 packets could cost nearly $15,000 (£11,060).It is alleged that some Israeli soldiers taking part in the devastation of Gaza, in which more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed, were also profiting from a campaign that is considered by aUN independent commissionand human rights organisations to be a genocide.According to his indictment announced on Thursday, Bezalel Zini, 50, is suspected of smuggling approximately 14 cartons of cigarettes intoGazaon three separate trips into the occupied territory, for which he allegedly received roughly $120,000 (£88,700).View image in fullscreenDavid Zini was appointed as head of the Shin Bet last May and began the job in October.Photograph: Olivier Fitoussi/AFP/Getty ImagesThe justice ministry accused Zini and his co-defendants of “assisting the enemy in wartime, performing transactions in property for terrorist purposes, obtaining something by fraud under aggravated circumstances, and taking bribes”.“A central category of prohibited goods smuggled into the strip was tobacco and cigarettes, which have put a total of hundreds of millions of shekels into Hamas’s coffers since the start of the war,” a ministry statement said.The ministry said the network had also smuggled iPhones, batteries, car parts and other goods into Gaza, alongside cigarettes, in an operation it said began last year.Zini’s defence lawyers said their client denied the charges. “Regarding the offence of aiding the enemy during wartime, it is a complete inversion of reality,”Haaretz quoted the legal teamas saying. The lawyers played down the severity of the alleged offences, arguing: “It’s only about cigarettes [and] any claim of aiding the enemy is baseless.”Zini is officially an Israeli army reservist but was also part of a small semi-official unit known as the Uriah Force, substantially made up of rightwing extremist volunteers, who reportedly brought bulldozers and other heavy equipment into Gaza and took part in widespread demolitions during the war. According to aninvestigation last September in Haaretz, the Uriah Force operated outside the official army chain of command.The indictment accuses Zini of “exploiting his position” and using the cover of moving Uriah Force equipment in and out of Gaza to smuggle the cigarettes.The rightwing newspaper Israel Hayom criticised the silence of the Shin Bet chief, David Zini, over his brother’s involvement in the affair.“Zini should not be punished for his brother’s actions (assuming he is convicted),” the newspaper said. “But he must tell the Israeli public the truth about treason allegations and other conspiracy theories, including in connection to the current affair.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

UN peacekeepers have said they were warned by the Israeli military to remain under cover while it carried out an aerial operation to drop what they said was a non-toxic chemical substance. Videos captured light aircraft spraying extensively over agricultural areas.Lebanese authorities said that laboratory analysis identified that the spray contained glyphosate, a potent herbicide that was in 2015classified by the World Health Organizationas “probably carcinogenic to humans”.One of the world’s most widely used herbicides, glyphosate is also sprayed on many crops just before harvest to dry them out. But studies have found glyphosate-based herbicides can interfere with various organs and biochemical pathways in mammals.In a joint statement, Lebanon’s ministries of agriculture and the environment said some samples showed glyphosate concentrations “20 and 30 times higher than normal [use]”. Its use would, they said, “damage vegetation in the targeted areas, with direct repercussions on agricultural production, soil fertility and ecological balance.The statement continued: “The two ministries affirm that the spraying of chemicals from military aircraft over Lebanese territory constitutes a serious act of aggression that threatens food security, inflicts severe damage on natural resources, and undermines the livelihoods of farmers, in addition to posing potential health and environmental risks to water, soil, and the entire food chain.”In the days leading up to the incident, videos also emerged of Israeli planes appearing to spray agricultural areas inside Syria onthree occasions in the space of a week.The southern Lebanese countryside still bears the ecological scars of an intense campaign by the Israeli military against Hezbollah that ended just over a year ago.In addition to an estimated 4,000 people killed, 17,000 injured and 1.2 million displaced, Israel has been accused of usingwhite phosphorusand incendiary bombs that burned farmland, olive groves and forests across southern Lebanon, andleft soils polluted with heavy metals, while the apparent use of cluster munitions left thelandscape littered with unexploded bombs.Hisham Younes, the founder and president of Green Southerners, a Lebanese environmental group, said the repeated attacks on southern Lebanon’s ecosystem would have “cumulative, complex and deep impacts”.“This spraying does not take place over an intact ecosystem or healthy soil capable of better absorbing or accommodating such impacts,” Younes told the Guardian. “It occurs over land and vegetation already severely stressed and degraded by the intensive use of white phosphorus, incendiary munitions and the accumulation of heavy-metal residues and other contaminants resulting from sustained bombardment.”Israel had deliberately targeted agricultural land, including beekeepers, Younes said. “The use of glyphosate compounds adds another layer of pressure on insect communities and pollinators, with direct and immediate repercussions for an already devastated agricultural sector.”Such tactics were in line with a “legacy of colonial practices” that informed the methods used by Israeli armed forces. “The very concept of ‘scorched’ or ‘dead’ land is rooted in a colonial tradition of warfare,” Younes said. “Israel has long relied on approaches characterised by long-term destructive effects, whether on landscapes and natural systems, on ecological features, or on the systematic undermining of the conditions necessary for sustaining life and livelihoods.“Within this continuum, the recent chemical spraying cannot be seen as an isolated incident. It forms part of an evolving pattern in which environmental harm is cumulative and increasingly difficult to reverse.”Explore more on these topicsLebanonIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They have quit the UK to benefit from the ultra-modern facilities on offer such as 5G telecommunications and state-of-the-art hospitals, to register their businesses, buy vast live-work spaces and trade with the rest of the world.View image in fullscreenAidan Doyle lays out his investment philosophy on YouTube – and says he misses the English countryside.Photograph: YoutubeLast year, the billionaire steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal joined a long procession of wealthy incomers, after saying he was quitting Britain for Dubai in protest against Labour’s abolition of non-dom status – a previously longstanding arrangement that allowed him to keep his wealth offshore free of UK tax.The 75-year-old, who bought a palatial home in a gated community known as the “Beverly Hills of Dubai”, was recently joined by Mukesh Ambani, often referred to as Asia’s richest person.Ambani bought one of Dubai’s most expensive home on the beachfront estate of Palm Jumeirah. The property has 10 bedrooms, Italian marble and a 70-metre private beach, and set him back $163m (£120m). As one local real estate consultant posted on TikTok: “This isn’t a home – it’s a statement.”High-profile celebrities such as the former tennis player Roger Federer and the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo have also bought expensive homes in Dubai.As a measure of the city’s popularity, figures from the international estate agent Knight Frank reveal a frenzied trade in property last year. It reported that more homes worth $2.5m to $10m were bought in Dubai than any other city in the world in the fourth quarter, ahead of New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and London.View image in fullscreenThe artificial islands of Palm Jumeirah.Photograph: Delpixart/GettyIn the $10m-plus bracket, there were 9,050 sales in Dubai compared with 6,577 in New York and 3,089 in London. In 2022, the UK capital was kingpin and sales of $10m-plus homes reached 5,826 against 4,543 in Los Angeles and 3,982 in Dubai.However, legions of middle-income fortune hunters are also swelling the 4-million population by about 200,000 a year.One of Dubai’s main attractions is zero income tax. The local government relies on sales taxes, a modest corporate tax, and substantial administration fees and charges levied by public authorities for the money to provide state services.During the pandemic Dubai became famous as a host to thousands of professionals working virtually, and for the prominent band of influencers who could dispense their advice and services against a backdrop of permanently blue skies and golden sands.While the zero tax on income played a part, so did the relatively short flight from Europe, which compares favourably with travelling to and from places such as Singapore.Professional migrants also like the strict street-crime laws, which keep Rolex and Ferrari theft to a minimum, and the relaxed attitude of the government to residencies, allowing anyone with a visa the chance to use the city as a base from which to mastermind their growing fortunes.To complete the picture, there is the hi-tech digital infrastructure, an abundance of luxury properties, 12 Michelin-starred restaurants, and a growing number of business and cultural events all year round.View image in fullscreenAnyone with a visa can use the city as a base to run their business.Photograph: Andrea Salerno Jacome/The GuardianSuch is the mix of people joining the 200,000 incomers each year that the band Madness jetted into Dubai for a gig last November, while performances of the musical Wicked will occupy the city’s opera house for much of this month. Migrants from Russia make up a large minority, hence the performance last month of the Nutcracker by the Russian State Ballet at the Zabeel theatre.Many of the 1 million or so Russian-born residents arrived after Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine. Flights between Russia and Dubai were maintained well after the war started, and the Gulf city allowed Russian incomers, as with others seeking residency, a visa in return for the purchase of a property or sizeable deposit account.Critics of Dubai say the authorities ignore money laundering, organised crime and crypto-currency trading that would not be tolerated in London or New York.The UAE government denies this and points to a move last year to deport Sean McGovern, a leader ofthe Kinahan organised crime group, which smuggles much of the cocaine that enters European markets. He was flown from the UAE to Ireland in the first extradition of its kind between the two countries.It is understood the gang’s founder, Christy Kinahan, and his sons Daniel and Christopher remain in Dubai and their children attend local international schools.The UAE has put in place financial regulations covering digital money that other jurisdictions, including London and New York, are struggling to piece together, according to the economist Brunello Rosa.Rosa, who counts many central bank executives as close contacts, recently co-wrote the bookSmart Money, which describes how digital money fits into three layers – central bank coins at the base, followed by a layer of money issued by private financial institutions and lastly, cryptocurrencies.View image in fullscreenDubai’s Global Village, a shopping, dining and entertainment complex.Photograph: Fadel Senna/AFP/GettyHe says: “So far, one of the only jurisdictions that seems to have recognised the importance of implementing this ‘pyramid’ of digital currencies is the UAE.”Nigel Green, the chief executive of the investment group deVere, says: “Dubai is what happens when a trading and commercial hub, a tax-efficient jurisdiction, and a future-focused vision all move into the same geographically advantageous location.“You’ve got a city where roughly 85-90% of residents are expatriates, all here to work, build and invest. Capital follows energy like that.”But incomers soon discover a huge disparity in pay between the richest and most other workers, says Azad Zangana, an economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, who has lived in the city for four months.“The level of disparity in pay levels is much higher than in Europe, but there is a range of housing and amenities in surrounding places that reduce the cost of living,” he says.Zangaza says traffic is the main problem across the region. That, and the summer heat, which can rise to 50C. Workers who have returned to the UK have also complained about a long-hours culture that means high pay is diluted.Doyle, an Instagram star since a series of hit videos laying out his investment philosophy, admits he misses the English countryside, but there is a nearby park and the city is becoming more family-oriented. And if he wants to see a greener environment, Oman is not far away.Talk of another property crash has failed to deter him from developing his business in Dubai. He says the demand for homes outstrips the number being built by a large margin.“Dubai sells itself the more you are here. I had a three-year plan to stay before leaving, but that doesn’t exist any more,” Doyle says.Explore more on these topicsDubaiReal estateThe super-richIncome taxBankingUnited Arab EmiratesMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

And the risks are very small, according to the systematic review and meta-analysis published inthe Lancet.Statins have been used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide over the last three decades and are proven to reduce heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular deaths. At the same time, millions have been put off the drugs amid long-running safety concerns, with statin labels listing dozens of possible side-effects.The study is the most comprehensive assessment of evidence for listed side-effects of statins. It examined 19 randomised controlled trials involving 124,000 people, with an average follow-up of four and a half years.Of the 66 side-effects currently listed on product labels, researchers found no strong evidence to support statins causing 62 of them, such as memory problems, depression, sleep disturbances and nerve damage leading to tingling in the hands and feet.The results showed the risk of most listed side-effects was minimal while the benefits far outweighed potential harms. As a result, labels should be updated to better reflect the evidence so patients and doctors could make more informed choices about statins, the researchers said.The study’s lead author, Christina Reith, an associate professor at Oxford University, said: “What we were able to show reliably was that statins did not make these commonly experienced events occur more often.“So for example, the percentage of people suffering memory loss per year was similar to those taking statin therapy as those not, equally. The percentage of people suffering sleep problems per year was similar to those taking statin therapy as for those not.“This means that we now have really good evidence that although these things may well happen to people while they take statins, that statins are not the cause of these problems.”While the study also noted the potential for side-effects appearing after statin use for longer than the average follow-up time, Reith said it provided “reassurance that, for most people, the risk of side-effects is greatly outweighed by the benefits of statins”.Prof Sir Rory Collins, emeritus professor of medicine and epidemiology at Oxford and a senior author of the paper, said: “Now that we know that statins do not cause the majority of side-effects listed in package leaflets, statin information requires rapid revision to help patients and doctors make better-informed health decisions.”Prof Bryan Williams, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, which part-funded the research, said: “Statins are life-saving drugs, which have been proven to protect against heart attacks and strokes. This evidence is a much-needed counter to the misinformation around statins and should help prevent unnecessary deaths from cardiovascular disease.”Prof Victoria Tzortziou Brown, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “Those considering taking statins should be reassured by this comprehensive study, which shows that while statins, like any medication, have potential side-effects, the risk for most people is low.“It remains important to note that while statins can have real benefits for some patients, they won’t be appropriate for everyone so the decision to prescribe should always be the result of a conversation between the GP and patient about the various risks and benefits.”Explore more on these topicsStatinsHealthMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

Deportations of foreign national offenders have risen by 32%, with more than 8,700 deported under thisLabourgovernment.TheHome Officealso released footage showing a recent removals flight, with detainees, their faces blurred, being escorted on to a plane destined for eastern Europe.The figures have been released as the home secretary,Shabana Mahmood, said she would “scale up” the number of deportations even further.Keir Starmer’s government, languishing third in recent polls behind Reform UK and the Tories, has pledged to ramp up deportations, end the use of asylum hotels and curb the number of small boats bringing people across the Channel.More than 65,000 people have arrived in the UK by crossing the Channel since Starmer became prime minister.The Home Office is preparing to introduce legislation to stop those facing possible removal from “gaming the system” by using the European convention on human rights to appeal against their removal.The UK is one of several countries pushing for changes in the way the treaty is interpreted, notably in its Article 3 protection against inhuman or degrading treatment and the Article 8 right to a family life.Both articles have been used to challenge deportation and removal decisions. Unauthorised migrants will also be restricted to a single route of appeal, the Home Office outlined.Mahmood said: “I vowed to scale up removals of illegal migrants – and we have. However, we must go further to remove those that have no right to be in our country. I will do whatever it takes to restore order and control.”The government has also pledged to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by the end of this parliament by using more basic accommodation such as military sites instead.Fewer than 200 asylum accommodation hotels remain in use, the government said, compared with a peak of 400 under the previous government.Reacting to the Home Office announcement, Minnie Rahman, the chief executive of the migrant charity Praxis, said: “Many of those labelled ‘foreign national offenders’ have lived in the UK for most of their lives and have a legitimate right to be here.“Yet, while the government has still not implemented key lessons from theWindrushlessons learned review, it continues to promote harmful and racist stereotypes that equate migration with criminality. This is unjust, divisive, and deeply damaging.”Griff Ferris, a spokesperson for the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: “The government continues to perpetrate this cruelty and violence in an increasingly desperate attempt to court the far right. It has gone very far down a very dark road, and this announcement of mass deportations while also seeking to gut rights protections is frightening, alongside the home secretary using openly fascist rhetoric.“Behind these numbers are real people who have had their lives torn apart. We need a compassionate system that puts people first, with the same routes of travel accessible for everyone, and the same good quality, safe housing for everyone.”Natasha Tsangarides, a director at Freedom from Torture, said: “Chipping away at Article 3 of the ECHR is a dangerous game that could trigger a domino effect worldwide. Any attempts to erode Article 3 protections risks undermining our shared right to live a life free from torture and does the dirty work of repressive regimes abroad. This is not who we are as a country.”Explore more on these topicsHome OfficeImmigration and asylumShabana MahmoodLabourMigrationPublic services policyHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

The current situation is unsustainable.”Karl Turner, the Hull East MP and a vocal critic of the current No 10 operation, said McSweeney staying wouldleave the prime minister’s position “untenable”. “I don’t want the PM to go. What I want is the PM to make changes,” he told the BBC.Downing Street officials pointed to Starmer’s strong defence of McSweeney in the Commons on Wednesday, in which he said nothing had changed. Supporters of the PM are aware that shedding his chief of staff could leave Starmer more directly in the firing line in a future crisis.Amid continued speculation about a possible leadership challenge, Starmer sought to regain the initiative with a speech and media Q&A in Hastings, ostensibly about community values but which was dominated by the Mandelson aftermath.Starmer said he understood the frustration of his MPs, and called on them to rally round the government.Saying the victims of Epstein had “lived with trauma that most of us could barely comprehend”, Starmer went on: “I want to say this. I am sorry – sorry for what was done to you, sorry that so many people with power failed, sorry for having believed Mandelson’s lies and appointed him, and sorry that even now you’re forced to watch this story unfold in public once again.”Pressed on why he had approved the appointment whenMandelson’s post-prison links to Epstein were public knowledge, he dodged the question, blaming what he said were lies by Mandelson and the need to examine vetting procedures.View image in fullscreenThe prime minister has said Morgan McSweeney retains his confidence.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThere is increasing frustration among some ministers about the delay in releasing the documents. None are expected until next week at the earliest, and with officials saying they do not even knowhow many messages and files might be involved, there are concerns the process could take weeks.Starmer had planned to release documents on Wednesday, before the Conservative motion that forced the issue, but he was delayed by a warning from the Metropolitan police that some of the information could affect their investigation into whether Mandelson leaked market-sensitive information as a minister.The Mandelson Scandal: has Starmer finally lost control? – Politics WeeklyRead moreSome in the cabinet believe the government should overrule the police, with one arguing it would show “leadership” to exercise judgment that documents relating to Mandelson’s vetting were not likely to have any links to the criminal investigation.However, of the material the Met has so far been shown by the government, it is understood to have concerns over only a small number of documents being published, believed to be fewer than 10, a small portion of those reviewed by detectives.For the majority of documents, detectives raised no objections to them being released to the public.Wednesday’s Commons motion said any decisions on whether documents should be held back or redacted would be made not by the government but by parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC), a compromise that got Labour backbenchers on board.In a letter to Starmer on Thursday, the chair and deputy chair of the ISC said any material deemed sensitive should be provided in full to them, with the committee deciding what should not be published.The ISC could not say how long its task would take until it knew the number of documents to be examined, said the letter from Labour peer Kevan Jones, the chair, and Conservative MP Jeremy Wright, the vice-chair. The committee, they added, would be “grateful to, now, be told the date on which we will receive those papers”.While Downing Street said it had “begun discussions with the ISC about the process for releasing these documents”, the committee disputes this, saying it was carrying out the wishes of the Commons, not No 10, and that ministers simply had to provide the information.What are files from Mandelson’s US ambassador appointment likely to reveal?Read moreThe vacuum of new information is making itharder for Downing Street to move on from speculationabout Starmer’s future. UK long-term borrowing costs hit their highest level since the budget on Thursday as traders reacted to the possibility of a change in No 10.Asked about mass dissatisfaction among his MPs, Starmer told them to instead focus on key messages like the cost of living, saying: “Every minute you spend not talking and focusing on that is an absolute minute wasted.”But even many sympathetic voices seem to be losing patience. Speaking to Sky’s Electoral Dysfunction podcast, Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, said Starmer should “stop blaming Mandelson”, take responsibility for the appointment and undertake a “reset” of his No 10 team.She added: “I don’t think it’s inevitable that it will bring him down, but it will bring him down unless he takes the action, which is really necessary for him to take.”Opposition parties have called for a no-confidence vote in the prime minister, with the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, raising the issue on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourPeter MandelsonMorgan McSweeneynewsShareReuse this content"

He also claimed the deal was one of many “national security reasons” why the US should acquire Greenland.Under the deal, Britain would cede control over the islands toMauritiusbut lease the largest, Diego Garcia, for 99 years to continue operating a joint US-UK military base there.Trump endorsed the handoverwhen Starmer visited the White House last year.But posting on Truth Social last month, Trump wrote: “There is no doubt that China and Russia have noticed this act of total weakness.“The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.”But after a “very productive” phone call with Starmer on Thursday, Trump appeared to backtrack to a position of approval for the deal.The US president wrote on Truth Social that Diego Garcia was “strategically situated in the middle of the Indian Ocean and, therefore, of great importance to the National Security of the United States”.He added that US military operations have succeeded over the past year “because of the strength of our warfighters, modern capability of our equipment and, very importantly, the strategic location of our Military Bases.“I understand that the deal Prime Minister Starmer has made, according to many, the best he could make.”But Trump added: “If the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers U.S. operations and forces at our Base, I retain the right to Militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia.“Let it be known that I will never allow our presence on a Base as important as this to ever be undermined or threatened by fake claims or environmental nonsense.”After Starmer and Trump’s phone call, a Downing Street spokesperson said they “agreed on the importance of the deal to secure the joint UK-US base on Diego Garcia, which remains vital to shared security interests”.The pair also agreed that the “UK and US will continue to work closely on the implementation of the deal”, the spokesperson said.The Conservative party and Reform UK have been highly critical of the Chagos Islands deal. Reacting to Trump’s announcement, Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “The president’s statement today recognises a critical weakness in the surrender deal – the lease could fall apart, leaving our national security and that of our allies in even greater doubt. The deal is clearly a threat to our national security and is a massive strategic blunder.“The Conservative party’s view is unchanged. We have led the fight against this appalling surrender and we will continue fighting it to the end.”Trump’s reversal comes after he softened his plan to take control of Greenland, which is a semi-autonomous territory belonging to Denmark, a Nato member.After talks with Nato’s secretary-general, Mark Rutte, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum last month, Trump announced that a “framework of a future deal” on Greenland had been reached after weeks of escalating threats.Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsDonald TrumpKeir StarmerForeign policyUS foreign policyMauritiusnewsShareReuse this content"

Mandelsonresigned from the Labour partyon Sunday.The former minister wassacked as ambassador to the USin September after the emergence of emails that suggested he had a close relationship with Epstein, who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial over child sex-trafficking charges. The further allegation thatMandelson leaked sensitive informationon government policy to Epstein has triggered a political crisis for the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer.The newly released emails from the US Department of Justice investigation have also put Global Counsel under intense scrutiny.The Financial Times reportedthat Barclays had dropped the firm due to frustration over its handling of Mandelson’s remaining stake, citing a person close to the situation.Vodafone said its “current one-year contract ends in March” and “no decisions have been taken regarding its renewal”, the FT reported.Barclays and Vodafone were approached for comment.Rokos Capital Management, a £16bn London hedge fund, on Thursday said it had“terminated” talks with Mandelsonover an advisory role after revelations of the government leaks.The Epstein files appeared to show that Mandelson regularly shared information about his efforts to start Global Counsel with Epstein. He also shared emails on his other business dealings, such asseeking the lucrative role of chairat the mining company Glencore. Mandelson did not secure that job, but Global Counsel did win business providing Glencore with “strategic advice”. Glencore has previously declined to comment.The files also suggested that Global Counsel’s chief executive and co-founder, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, had met Epstein in person at his house in 2010, and had directly emailed Epstein at least twice.Calls to halt UK Palantir contracts grow amid ‘lack of transparency’ over dealsRead moreGlobal Counsel’s other clients include Palantir, a military and security technology firm with deep ties to the administration of Donald Trump. The UK government has been urged to release information on Mandelson’s rolewhen Starmer visited Palantir’s showroomin Washington DC in February 2025, shortly after Mandelson became ambassador to the US. Palantir has previously declined to comment.Starmer has said that Mandelson lied to him about the extent of his ties to Epstein, but heapologised to Epstein’s victims on Thursdayfor appointing Mandelson to the ambassador role, and “having believed Mandelson’s lies and appointed him”.Mandelson was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsBarclaysVodafoneLobbyingPeter MandelsonJeffrey EpsteinBankingGlencorenewsShareReuse this content"

The fourth-quarter earnings of the e-commerce and cloud-computing giant came in slightly below Wall Street estimates even as sales and growth surged.‘It’s an absolute bloodbath’: Washington Post lays off hundreds of workersRead moreAmazon will increase capital spending to $200bn this year from $125bn, CEO Andy Jassy said in a press release. Wall Street analysts were expecting spending to rise to roughly $147bn, according to FactSet.“With such strong demand for our existing offerings and seminal opportunities like AI, chips, robotics, and low earth orbit satellites, we expect to invest about $200 billion in capital expenditures across Amazon in 2026, and anticipate strong long-term return on invested capital,” Jassy said.Amazon’s investment is the latest sign that cloud-computing giants will not be hitting the brakes any time soon on hefty AI investments. Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet’s Google and Meta are expected to collectively spend more than $630bn this year.Revenue at Amazon rose 14% to $213.4bn in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, compared with $187.8bn in the year-ago period. The company reported net income of $21.2bn, or $1.95 per share, for the three-month period ending on 31 December.

Amazon reported the fastest growth in its prominent cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), in 13 quarters, with revenue increasing 24% to $35.6bn. Advertising revenue rose 22%, per a press release.Bezos, owner of the Post, is the executive chair of Amazon’s board of directors, a role he assumed in 2021 after founding Amazon in 1994 and serving as CEO for the better part of three decades.

The attorney shortage – due in part to the increasing difficulty of recruiting attorneys for the low-salary, high-caseload jobs – has meant that people have had cases hanging over them for extended periods of time, impacting their housing, employment and families, advocates say.Oregon’s highest court ruled on Thursday that dismissals are required if the state failed to provide counsel within 60 days after arraignment for a misdemeanor and within 90 days for a felony. Statedataon unrepresented defendants showed that as of this week, more than 1,400 active cases fall in that category, including hundreds of people who have been waiting more than a year for an attorney.The ruling dictates that the cases be dismissed without prejudice, meaning prosecutors can re-file charges. The court said charges can be brought again “when the state is able to provide the counsel to which a defendant is entitled”. The ruling also said dismissal isn’t required if during the 60- or 90-day period the defendant failed to appear in court for a required hearing.The case originated with a man named Allen Rex Roberts, who was charged with unauthorized use of a vehicle and possession of a stolen car in August 2021. The charges were dismissed in October 2022 because of the state’s failure to appoint him a lawyer, but in April 2024, prosecutors re-indicted Roberts on the same charges. For the next year, Roberts repeatedly returned to court for hearings where he was supposed to be appointed counsel, but each time no attorney was available. Eventually, his case was again dismissed due to a lack of attorneys.The right to counsel isenshrinedin the Oregon and US constitutions, and the shortage of attorneys has led to mass violations of those fundamental rights and pushed the criminal legal system to the brink, advocates say. The vast majority of defendants in the state are indigent and cannot afford a private attorney.“Many folks who are eligible for dismissal after the court’s opinion today have been facing the criminal justice system without assistance for months or years,” said Jessica Snyder, a lawyer who co-wrote an amicus brief in the case on behalf of the federal public defenders in Oregon. “The harm is great. It has led to individuals losing their housing, losing contact with their children because of no-contact orders, [and] losing the opportunity to preserve evidence in their criminal case.”Some defendants would have been able to quickly resolve their cases if they simply could afford a private attorney, Snyder noted.“The toll is also psychological. A lot of clients talked about the despair they felt coming back to court over and over again without someone to help them, how confused they felt, how the court wouldn’t listen to their concerns or prosecutors wouldn’t help them navigate the system,” said Snyder.A previous courtrulingdictated that the state must release defendants from jail within seven days of appearing in court if they aren’t appointed an attorney. That means the more than 1,400 cases impacted by Thursday’s ruling mostly involve defendants who are already out of custody.The attorney shortage is a systemic and statewide problem in Oregon, and thecauses are complex, with criminal defense lawyers noting the state has long underfunded public defense, leaving few public defenders overwhelmed with massive caseloads. A backlog of cases during the pandemic and increasing time required to review materials like body-camera footage and digital evidence has further strained the system, advocates say.Oregon’s crisis is particularly acute, but attorney shortages have createdproblemsacross the country, including inWashington state,Maine,Illinois,UtahandNew Hampshire.Nadia Dahab, a Portland-based attorney who argued the Roberts case, said she hoped the ruling would force the state to pursue a “solution that recognizes the importance of access to counsel for people charged with a crime and allocates the resources necessary to make sure the public defense system adequately protects them”.“Roberts,” she added, “is one of thousands, and the harms he suffered through the arrest warrant when the state recharged him and through the impact of having to take off work to go to court every month – those are very exemplary of what lots of others are facing.”Oregon’s department of justice had argued against blanket dismissals in the Roberts case.Dan Rayfield, the state attorney general, said in a statement on Thursday that the state’s legislature had stepped up to increase investments, and he said: “Oregonians deserve solutions.” He continued: ‘Too many are being left without legal representation – some sitting in jail, others stuck in limbo outside of custody, unable to move their cases forward. That is not acceptable for public safety.”Rayfield said the state respects the supreme court’s decision to “set clear limits on how long someone can go without counsel” and he expected the Oregon Public Defense Commission (OPDC), the agency that oversees the public defense system, to meet the standards established by the court and “take responsibility for ensuring people are represented”.The OPDC said in a statement it was assessing the decision and that the commission had made progress in reducing the number of unrepresented individuals and would “continue to address the crisis with urgency and transparency”. The statement noted that there were 2,494 people without an attorney at the end of January, down 37% from the year prior.“We will collaborate with our partners in the criminal justice community to respond to this ruling and build on this progress while protecting defendants’ rights and public safety,” the statement said.The public defender crisis was exacerbated last year as Oregon abandoned a policy effort to decriminalize drugs, leading to a surge in arrests for possession that furtherburdened attorneys and clogged up the courts.The Metropolitan Public Defenders, which represents indigent defendants in Portland and the surrounding region, said in a statement that increasing the number of public defenders alone would not solve the crisis, and urged for more reforms that would reduce the volume of cases in the system: “Oregon needs more community-based resources, and the system needs more … alternatives to prosecution and incarceration.”John Wentworth, president of the Oregon District Attorneys Association, which represents the state’s prosecutors, criticized the supreme court decision in a statement, saying: “Criminal defendants, their victims and our communities will continue to lack justice as potentially thousands of cases will now be dismissed. This is an immense waste of taxpayers’ money.”Wentworth, the district attorney of Clackamas county, called on the state’s governor and OPDC to “fix this problem now”, writing: “Our indigent defense system must deliver the service it is funded to provide.”Explore more on these topicsOregonUS justice systemWest CoastUS prisonsnewsShareReuse this content"

Select lawmakers were able to view the complaint this week.Cotton wrote on X on Thursday that he agreed with an earlier inspector general’s conclusion that the complaint did not appear to be credible. He said he believed the complaint was prompted by political opposition to Gabbard and theTrump administration.“To be frank, it seems like just another effort by the president’s critics in and out of government to undermine policies that they don’t like,” wrote the Arkansas Republican, who chairs the Senate intelligence committee.When asked about the complaint, Cotton’s office referred to his social media post.Crawford, the House intelligence committee chair, also of Arkansas, said he believed the complaint was an attempt to smear Gabbard’s reputation.Democrats are pushing for explanations about why it took Gabbard’s office months to refer the complaint to the required members of Congress. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said the law requires such a report to be sent within 21 days.“The law is clear,” Warner said at the Capitol. “I think it was an effort to try to bury this whistleblower complaint.”Warner said he also still had questions about the details of the complaint, noting that it was heavily redacted.The top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, Jim Himes of Connecticut, said in a written statement that he would keep looking into the matter.In a memo sent to lawmakers this week, the intelligence community’s inspector general said the complaint also accused Gabbard’s office of general counsel of failing to report a potential crime to the Department of Justice. The memo, which contains redactions, does not offer further details of either allegation.Last June, the then inspector general, Tamara Johnson, found that the claim Gabbard distributed classified information along political lines did not appear to be credible, according to the current watchdog, Christopher Fox. Johnson was “unable to assess the apparent credibility” of the accusation about the general counsel’s office, Fox wrote in the memo.Fox said he would have deemed the complaint non-urgent, unlike the previous inspector general, but respected the decision of his predecessor and therefore sent it to lawmakers.Copies of the top-secret complaint were hand-delivered this week to the “gang of eight” – a group comprising the House and Senate leaders from both parties as well as the four top lawmakers on the House and Senate intelligence committees.Andrew Bakaj, attorney for the person who made the complaint, has said that while he cannot discuss the details of the report or the identity of its author, there is no justification for keeping it from Congress since last spring. Bakaj is a former CIA officer and chief legal counsel at Whistleblower Aid.Gabbard coordinates the work of the nation’s 18 intelligence agencies. She has recently drawn attention for another matter – appearing on site last week when the FBI served a search warrant on election offices in Georgia that are central to Trump’s disproven claims about fraud in the 2020 election.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsRepublicansHouse of RepresentativesUS SenatenewsShareReuse this content"

The storied newspaper’s future is now in question, according to its former executive editor.“The aspirations of this news organization are diminished,” Baron told the Guardian in an interview. “I think that’ll translate into fewer subscribers. And I hope it’s not a death spiral, but I worry that it might be.”Matt Murray, who now leads the Post as editor in chief, promised staffers on Wednesday that the news organization had a plan to survive and thrive into the future – as it executed one of the largest layoffs in American newspaper history. Nearly one-third of the entire company – which stood at 2,500 employees in late 2023, before a round of buyouts – was axed.The cutsdecimated large swaths of the newspaper, shuttering its sports department and shredding its teams covering local news, style and the world, not to mention its audio and video departments, which had already been battered by previous cuts. Commercial teams were also cut.‘It’s an absolute bloodbath’: Washington Post lays off hundreds of workersRead moreAll told, the Post is now a significantly smaller news organization, and one that many journalists who care deeply about the institution worry will be significantly less ambitious, just as the media industry confronts both financial headwinds and animosity from Donald Trump and his officials.Trump regularly threatens news networks and encourages his regulatory arms to crack down on outlets he dislikes. During an incredibly newsworthy period in American history,news networks like CBS News– now owned by the Trump-friendly Ellison family – and evennewspapers like the Atlanta Journal-Constitutionhave endured rounds of layoffs in recent months.Baron, who led the Post for eight years until 2021, wrote favorably about the tech billionaire Jeff Bezos’s stewardship of the paper in his 2023 memoir. But now, Baron said, “he’s not the owner he was”.He attributes this change to the re-election of Trump in November 2024 – and a desire for Bezos to stay on his good side to protect the other companies he controls: Amazon, the retail giant, and the spaceflight startup Blue Origin.Bezos,who remained silent in recent weeksas Post employees pleaded with him to avoid cuts, has not responded to the Guardian’s requests for comment.“I think the most important thing that’s changed is that Donald Trump is back in the White House, and he clearly would seek vengeance against his political enemies,” Baron said on Wednesday. “I understand why Bezos might fear the consequences of that. I understand that he would fear that Trump would deny contracts to Amazon and deny contracts to Blue Origin.“But I think that the Post is important, too, and it’s even more important than those other enterprises to American democracy. I firmly believe that Bezos is prioritizing his other business efforts over theWashington Post.”Much of the blame – from employees past and present – has centered on the Post’s publisher Will Lewis, who was hired by Bezos in late 2023 to help reverse the newspaper’s fortunes. Lewis did not appear during a Zoom conversation with employees on Wednesday morning, which struck some employees as odd.“I think he was awol today, and I think he’s been awol in the past,” Baron said. “He’s kind of the invisible publisher. When you announce something as traumatic as what they announced today, shouldn’t the publisher be on the call?”Donald E Graham, who sold the Post to Bezos in 2013, on Wednesday broke his general policy of not commenting on the current ownership. “It’s a bad day,” he wrote ina widely shared post on Facebook. “I am sad that so many excellent reporters and editors ⁠–⁠ and old friends ⁠–⁠ are losing their jobs. My first concern is for them; I will do anything I can to help.”During a virtual meeting with employees on Wednesday morning, Murray said the Post’s largest reporting group would be its politics and government team, whose work “will remain central to our engagement and subscriber growth”. The Post will also cover national news, science, technology, climate and business, though with diminished staffs.But, as a smaller news organization focused primarily on covering politics, campaigns and the operation of the federal government and Trump administration, the Post faces stiff competition from outlets like Politico and Axios that have been laser-focused on those areas, not to mention smaller upstarts like Punchbowl News, which covers Congress.“I have no clue what their strategy was or is,” said Jim VandeHei, who left the Post in 2006 to co-found Politico, and later co-founded Axios, where he remains CEO. “We do: be useful, indispensable [and] illuminating to people who care deeply about government, AI, business and the information ecosystem. And then match the business expertise with our editorial excellence.”During the fall of 2024, the Post lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers after Bezosabruptly shelved its planned endorsement of Kamala Harrisfor president. He alsoreoriented the paper’s opinion pagesto a more narrow focus on supporting “personal liberties and free markets”.There are concerns that Wednesday’s cuts will create a new groundswell of cancellations that could further damage the Post’s financial health, not to mention the millions of dollars that could be paid out in severance.Furor over Washington Post’s decision to not endorse presidential candidate: ‘stab in the back’, ‘dying in darkness’Read moreRobert Allbritton, the former owner of Politico, said he was saddened by Wednesday’s layoffs. “These are some wonderful journalists who have produced quality work,” he said. “They will land at other publications, but the disruption is painful and not their fault.”Looking forward, “these layoffs signal that Jeff wants to move the Post back to sustainability”, Allbritton added. “I’m hopeful that once the Post regains its financial footing that Jeff will continue as a responsible owner of one of the most important brands in media.”Some Post veterans feel differently, and have called for Bezos to sell the newspaper. The union representing most Post employees said on Wednesday: “If Jeff Bezos is no longer willing to invest in the mission that has defined this paper for generations, and serve the millions who depend on Post journalism, then the Post deserves a steward that will.”But Baron highlighted a big question surrounding any potential sale: “To whom?”Explore more on these topicsWashington PostUS press and publishingNewspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

Amonths-long dipin cryptocurrency prices has tanked shares of companies that have increasingly invested in bitcoin, exacerbating broader stock market jitters.Bitcoin rode a high duringDonald Trump’s ascent to the presidency in 2024 and throughout 2025; its price steadily increased as the president made one industry-friendly move after another. Crypto’s largest currency hit $100,000 for the first time in December 2024 and even rose to a record high of $126,210.50 on 6 October, according to Coinbase. But bitcoin’s valuation has dipped over the last few months, falling especially hard in January and the start of February.Companies that went all in on bitcoin have been hit hard in the recent sell-off. CoinGecko data shows that the global crypto market has lost $2tn in value since early October.

The second-largest cryptocurrency, ether, has faced losses of more than 30% this year alone, adding insult to injuryafter it missed out on the boom of 2025.In addition to financial disaster, the cryptocurrency faces regulatory headwinds. Some Democrats and watchdogs in the US haveraised alarmsabout Trump’s conflicts of interest around cryptocurrencies and a lack of regulation under the current administration. US representative Ro Khanna said onWednesdaythat he planned to investigate World Liberty Financial, following reports from the Wall Street Journal that a member of the Emirati royal familybackeda $500m investment into the Trump family’s cryptocurrency company.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 7.20m unfilled jobs. Hiring increased by 172,000 positions to a still-low 5.293m in December.The data came as other numbers showed a larger-than-expected increase in Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits last week, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a stable labor market.The biggest rise in weekly jobless claims in nearly two months reported by the labor department on Thursday probably reflected distortions from snowstorms across much of the country as well as normalization after volatility linked to difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations around the holiday season and at the turn of the year.“There is no sign of the kind of layoffs we expect to see in a weakening labor market during the early days of a recession,” said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High FrequencyEconomics. “The level of claims is just very low. Claims are well within the recent range over the last two years.”Initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped 22,000, the largest increase since early December, to a seasonally adjusted 231,000 for the week ended 31 January, the labor department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 212,000 claims for the latest week.Heavy snow and freezing temperatures blanketed large portions of the country towards the end of January, which could have left some people unemployed temporarily. Claims shot up in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin.Claims are also probably rising as the volatility in late 2025 and early this year washes out of the data.Through the distortions, the labor market remains in what economists call a “low hire, low fire” mode.Friday’s job report, which would give the most accurate snapshot of the jobs market, has been delayed by the US government’s latest shutdown.Reuters contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsUS unemployment and employment dataUS economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Ryan, who hadworkedfor seven years at the Ethereum Foundation (EF), Ethereum’s de facto governing body, suggested that Ethereum could be on the cusp of an era-defining shift.Since its founding in 2014, the foundation had prioritized technical upgrades and had avoided centralizing power while its user base was growing, but Ethereum had now grown up, and the cryptocurrency world around it had grown up, too. The EF could now “exercise a stronger voice” without compromising its ethos of decentralization, Ryan said – and he was open to leading that charge if appointed as the foundation’s new executive director.Ryan told the Guardian that he could see how political tides were changing “overnight”, which informed his proposal. In part, his thesis drew from personal experience: He’d been served by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2024, only to have the case summarily dropped, which he suspects was a pragmatic move to avoid alienating the tech sector during Joe Biden’s re-election campaign. By November, with Donald Trump poised to return to the White House as the self-appointed “crypto president”, Ryan could identify “a massive American-shaped opportunity”.SEC drops lawsuit against Winklevoss twins’ crypto firmRead moreTrump’s re-election washeavily bankrolledby crypto companies and advocacy groups; the sector had establishedlucrative tiesto the Trump family, and expected a slate ofpolicy changesin its favor. A second Trump administration was likely to bolster the crypto industry’s ability to expand into the traditional financial sector, and vice versa, further buoying up Ethereum’s prospects. These new political and economic realities meant a “stronger voice” from the EF that could mean a windfall for Ethereum – a logic that helped catalyze a high-profile leadership shakeup within the Ethereum ecosystem, and, once the dust settled, anointed new leaders tasked with wooing Wall Street.Despite strong winds at the industry’s back, the value of Ethereum’s proprietary cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), is down 20% from one year ago, part of awidespread slump in crypto’s value. The price has remained almost unchanged since November 2024, when Ryan made his pitch, which is the same as it was in 2022, an asset at risk of depreciating in a world of high risk.ETH’s dual, dueling factionsThe Ethereum blockchain is a hub for hundreds of billions of dollars of financial products. Ether is the world’s second largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization hovering around $400bn. Founded in 2013 by programmer Buterin, ether is also the largest cryptocurrency to have a known leader. The identity of the founder ofBitcoin, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, is not publicly known. Following Ethereum’s launch, Buterin and others established the EF as a non-profit tasked with cultivating the Ethereum ecosystem – a centralized, neutral entity designed to grow a decentralized technological movement – and writing grants to ecosystem participants in line with that mission; the EF holds more than $600m worth of ETH in treasury. Buterin sits on the EF’s board.“In crypto in general, there are two sides of the space: there’s what they call the computer, and what they call the casino,” said Timour Kosters, the founder ofEdge City, a series of pop-up residency programs affiliated with Ethereum. The “computer” side looks to tackle systemic issues by building tech solutions, Kosters explained; the “casino” side leans into finance, including some scams. The two most prominent ideological camps within Ethereum follow this rule of thumb. On one end is Ethereum’s traditional and more libertarian ideological base, the “Cypherpunks”, who see privacy, decentralized protocols and freedom from state power as tools for individual freedom. On the other end, according to Paul Dylan-Ennis, a scholar who studies Ethereum’s subcultures, is a more “pragmatist” and “populist” cadre motivated by the price of ETH and seeking to expand institutional adoption of Ethereum and ETH.Ryan recalled the discussions with Buterin of his proposed strategic plan for the EF as being “positive”, and said the dialogue expanded to include other leaders within the foundation. That included Aya Miyaguchi, the organization’s longtime executive director and astewardof Ethereum’s traditional ideological core. But then news of these discussions was leaked to the public – opening the floodgates on social media.On X, some Ethereum users clamored for Ryan’s appointment, and lobbied for Miyaguchi’s ouster. Eric Conner, a veteran Ethereum developer,suggested“it’s revolt time” if the foundation failed to appoint Ryan as its new executive director. Some social media usersposteddeath threats against Miyaguchi, which incensed Buterin.ETH holders pressure their leadersSome Ethereum community members had been calling for leadership change at the EF over the course of 2024 – long before Ryan’s strategic meetings with EF leadership. Many pragmatists thought the foundation was not proactive enough in growing Ethereum’s adoption, including among financial institutions. Others blamed Miyaguchi for Ether’s relatively static price, as ETH had not skyrocketed in value the way bitcoin and other coins had with Trump’s rise.Paul Brody, who leads blockchain initiatives at Ernst & Young and is the chairman of theEnterprise Ethereum Alliance, a coalition of large businesses adopting Ethereum-based technology, said that, while critiques against Miyaguchi were “tinged with misogyny”, calling for a leadership change because of Ethereum’s static price resembles standard investor discontents.“In some ways, the Ethereum community is behaving a lot like pretty normal shareholders … They want a return on their investment,” he said.In January 2025, Buterin responded to this community pressure, framing the threats levied against Miyaguchi as “pure evil”. He added that the complaints were “decreasing the chance I have any interest whatsoever in doing ‘what you want’”.“The person deciding the new EF leadership team is me,” hetweeted.A former member of the EF, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal foundation matters, said Buterin’s social media post was a “turning point” and “uncharacteristic”, as the founder typically “pretended that [Ethereum] was in the hands of the community”. The former EF employee told the Guardian that EF management organized a foundation-wide retreat “in order to force” Buterin into naming a new executive director quickly, as Buterin “couldn’t really make up his mind”, and Miyaguchi had wanted to step back “for a while”. The source added that, in personal conversation, Buterin dismissed Ryan’s backers as a small but vocal American subset of the global Ethereum ecosystem. By the end, “the old management” was “almost universally hated” by the EF’s employees, they said.Another former EF employee, likewise speaking on the condition of anonymity, similarly noted that Buterin’s tweets were a departure from his typical “cosplaying” that he didn’t control Ethereum. Buterin and Miyaguchi have a close relationship, the former employee alleged, which informed Buterin’s reluctance to find Miyaguchi’s replacement more expediently, the source hypothesized.They claimed Buterin “isn’t over” the rejection of his work visa by US authorities in 2012 and remains “resolutely” against EF staff talking to US politicians. The former employee suspected this disfavor counted against Ryan, an American. Buterin only finalized a leadership change once he realized the extent of dissatisfaction within the EF, not just online, the employee concluded.Change is in the air, finallyOn 1 March 1, the EFannouncedthe appointment of two co-executive directors: one from each strand of Ethereum’s culture, according to Dylan-Ennis, the Ethereum scholar: Tomasz Stańczak, a former vice-president at Citi, and Hsiao-Wei Wang, a veteran Ethereum-focused engineer.The EF’s new leaders were brought on specifically with a “mandate of being more open, communicating more, and [being] responsible to the business world”, which is home to “builders focused on real-world use cases”, Stańczak told the Guardian in November. “Compared to previous years, there is probably much more green light for institutions to adopt Ethereum,” he added. The EF now operatesa landing pagedesigned for institutions interested in understanding and potentially adopting Ethereum technology.Two former EF employees said these basic changes highlight the extent to which the foundation had previously adopted a “defensive posture” and had “worried about the SEC”, using opacity and plausible deniability to avoid legal action. To that end, the EF only published a public-facing organizational chart over the summer, partly anonymizing its employees prior to that shift. The foundation’s growth and clear hierarchy also depart from its longstanding decentralized ethos; during her time as executive director, Miyaguchi hadcalled forthe EF to “subtract” in size and power over time.“The surprising twist in recent times is now the EF is seen as very much directing ‘Ethereum the protocol’ and, to some extent, ‘Ethereum the culture’,” Dylan-Ennis said. “In this sense, [the foundation] has become more important than ever. It is too early to say whether this is for the better or the worse.”‘American-shaped opportunity’Ryan emphasized in an interview that he has “the utmost respect for Aya Miyaguchi”. The public leak of their discussions around the EF’s future led to “a lot of toxicity” that “threw off” their dialogue, he added. Buterin and Ryan decided to amicably “close the door” on their discussions by January 2025. Ryan said this was not solely because of the online campaign, but also due to differences in opinion about the Ethereum Foundation’s next steps – including the “American-shaped opportunity” lying beyond the EF’s interests.Connected to other Wall Street-facing Ethereum evangelists by senior EF leadership, Ryan announced in February 2025 that he was co-foundingEtherealize, an EF-aligned organization building and marketing Ethereum-based products for traditional financial institutions. Etherealize frequently exercises a strong voice for Ethereum as it does the rounds on Capitol Hill and Wall Street.Vivek Raman, a co-founder ofEtherealize, said Ethereum-focused sales cycles with large financial institutions once spanned years and involved frequent rejection, but are now accelerating, a sign Wall Street is warming to cryptocurrency. Major firms like JP Morgan, Fidelity and BlackRock are seeking to offer financial products issued on blockchains, in a process called “tokenization”, he said, predicting that a wave of these products will enter the market in 2026 after December 2025 launches.However, ether, like other major cryptocurrencies, is still crawling back from a sudden drop in value.“The price of crypto has fallen like 40% in the last six months,” said Brody of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. “You don’t see people talking about the current leadership … the way they did about Aya 18 months ago. You just don’t.”Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesBitcoinE-commercefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He also said that holding tech executives liable for illegal, hateful or harmful content would encourage “over-censorship” and lead platforms to “delete anything remotely controversial to avoid risks, silencing political dissent, journalism, and everyday opinions”.View image in fullscreenThe message sent by Telegram founder Pavel Durov to all the app’s users in Spain.Photograph: Social Media/ReutersSpanish government sources hit back, saying Durov’s unprecedented message to millions of users was designed to erode trust in institutions and demonstrated the need for social media and mobile messaging apps to be regulated.“Telegram founderPavel Durovused his unrestricted control of the app to send a mass message to all users in Spain, spreading several lies and making illegitimate attacks against the government. This is the first time this has happened in our country’s history,” they said.“Spaniards cannot live in a world where foreign tech oligarchs can flood our phones with propaganda at will simply because the government has announced measures to protect minors and enforce the law.”Durov wasarrested in Paris in August 2024as part of an inquiry into allegations of fraud, drug trafficking, organised crime, promotion of terrorism and cyberbullying. He was detained on suspicion of failing to take action to curb the allegedlycriminal use of his platformand was eventually charged with 12 offences. He was later released under judicial supervision and has denied all the charges against him, describing his arrest as“legally and logically absurd”and saying investigators were “struggling to find anything that I or Telegram did wrong”.Following the arrest, Telegram released a statement saying its chief executive “had nothing to hide” and that it was “absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform”.The Spanish government statement released on Wednesday said Durov had “deliberately designed a minimal moderation architecture that has turned Telegram into a recurring space for documented criminal activities such as child sex trafficking and drug trafficking”, with cases under investigation inSpain,FranceandSouth Korea.On Tuesday, French prosecutorsraided the French headquartersof Musk’s social media platform, X, and summoned him and the company’s former chief executive for questioning as part of an investigation into alleged cybercrime.View image in fullscreenAfter Elon Musk appeared recently to take issue with Spain’s plan to regularise 500,000 undocumented people, Sánchez posted: ‘Mars can wait. Humanity can’t.’Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersThe investigation, launched in January last year, is examining alleged offences including complicity in the possession and organised distribution of child abuse images, violation of image rights through sexualised deepfakes and denial of crimes against humanity.In a statement issued after the raid, X said: “The allegations underlying today’s raid are baseless and X categorically denies any wrongdoing. Today’s staged raid reinforces our conviction that this investigation distorts French law, circumvents due process, and endangers free speech.”Growing anxieties over the harmful effects of social media have led a number of governments, including Spain, Britain, Greece and France, to adopt or consider the adoption of more stringent legislation. In December, Australia became thefirst country to ban children under 16 from such platforms.Why Telegram is the go-to app for those wanting to spread toxic informationRead moreConcern and anger over the tech barons’ propensity to interfere in domestic politics is increasingly prompting some European governments to swap the traditional codes of diplomaticpolitessefor humour, memes, rebuttal and ridicule – all on social media.The French foreign ministry launched its @FrenchResponse account late last year, reflecting its belief that in a hostile online information environment it is both willing and able to deploy the billionaires’ own tools and language against them.“Protecting children online is only ‘controversial’ for those who profit from not doing it. Everyone else agrees,”@FrenchResponse replied on Xto Durov’s claim that Europe was “weaponising child protection to legitimise censorship and mass surveillance”.The @FrenchResponse account first made a splash on 11 January, quote-replying to a post from Musk that asked “Why is the UK government so fascist?” with a photo of the X owner making what resembled a Nazi salute during Donald Trump’s inauguration.The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, praised the account’s strategy last month, saying: “The only right attitude, in the information war that has begun, is to raise our voice and to turn up the volume.”Sánchez has used X to push back at the platform’s owner, who is also chief executive of SpaceX. After Musk appeared to take issue with Spain’s recent plan to regularise500,000 undocumented migrants and asylum seekers, the prime ministerreplied: “Mars can wait. Humanity can’t.”On Wednesday evening, he adapted a celebrated, if apocryphal, line from Don Quixote to respond to the barbs of Musk and Durov. The phrase – “Let the dogs bark, Sancho, it means we’re on track” – is used to suggest that shouts of disapproval and discouragement mean you’re doing something right. Sánchezrepurposed it as: “Let the tech-oligarchs bark, Sancho, it means we’re on track.”Worries over the primacy and ubiquity of US tech products have led some European countries to roll out plans to reduce their use of some well-known digital services. Last week, the French government announced 2.5 million civil servants would stop using US video-conferencing tools – including Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Webex and GoTo Meeting – and would switch to Visio, a homegrown service, by 2027.The French civil service minister David Amiel said the aim was “to put an end to the use of non-European solutions, to guarantee the security and confidentiality of public electronic communications by relying on a powerful and sovereign tool”.Meanwhile, Denmark’s government and the cities of Copenhagen and Aarhus have been trying out open-source software. “We must never make ourselves so dependent on so few that we can no longer act freely,” the digital minister, Caroline Stage Olsen, wrote on LinkedIn last year. “Too much public digital infrastructure is currently tied up with very few foreign suppliers.”The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSpainTelegramSocial media bansSocial mediaOnline abuseInternet safetyYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

Kraft encouraged two of his players – the twins Devin and Jason McCourty – into deeper citizenship, to engage with the legal and political systems and promote reforms. As a sign of compassion and a willingness to listen, Kraftvisitedthe incarcerated rapper Meek Mill, and later the two partnered with another artist, Jay-Z, on various criminal justice initiatives.Trump loomed over baseball’s Hall of Fame. But voters still said no to Bonds and ClemensRead moreOn 6 January 2021, when so many of the voices loudest in their opposition to player protests, the ones who said the dissenting ballplayers were treasonous for disrespecting both the American flag and law enforcement at the behest of outgoing presidentDonald Trumpstormed the US Capitol and contributed to the deaths of one policeman and the trauma and eventual deaths of several others, it was Kraft who was apparently so disgusted that he stopped talking to Trump, publicly distancing himself from the man to whose inauguration four years earlier he had donated $1m.Five years later, as the Patriots return to the Super Bowl for the first time since 2019, the American sporting and political landscape is far less principled. In the wake of Trump’s second election the athlete voice has been rendered politically dormant. The George Floyd moment is over, thethree-day “pause”after the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that shut down the sports world a lost memory in the hostile onrush of a racial retrenchment and restorative whiteness this country hasn’t seen since the dawn of the first world war.The players are silent, but the political aggression long attributed to the players remains. It just switched aisles. Trump’s return signaled to the NFL the coast was clear to retreat from its aspirational sloganeering. The flags and flyovers and remote shots of far-flung military bases are still embedded in the television broadcasts, but the words “End Racism” that once appeared in the back of end zones around the leaguehave disappeared. The vague “It Takes All of Us” remains, but “to do what, exactly?” is still unclear. A coaching cycle with 10 job openings these past few weeks resulted inthe hiring of zero Black coaches– recurring proof that teams hire minorities only when forced. The specter of Trump is omnipresent. The Harbaugh brothers – Giants coach John and Chargers coach Jim –openly embrace him. The feeling is mutual.Trump at the Super Bowl: how the NFL’s culture war ended in surrenderRead moreDuring this retrenchment, where was the former ostensible voice of reason? Kraft was back again with Trump, basking in toxic afterglow at the premiere of Melania, Amazon MGM Studios’ $40m documentary of Melania Trump. (The Guardian’s verdict:zero stars.) Bygones, it seems, are bygones.Kraft’s reversal represents the malleable ethics of the billionaire class, of the consistent gaslighting of a sporting public that desperately wants to see goodness in their games, for sports to lack the stench of the myriad pollutants associated with power, from the willful breaking of brains and bodies, to gambling, to Trump, to somehow be separate from the entire noxious atmosphere. Such is not possible.View image in fullscreenRobert Kraft and the Patriots visited Donald Trump at the White House after their Super Bowl win in 2017.Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesThat leaves Kraft. His team is triumphantly back, but as the country slips deeper into authoritarianism, he now looks as exposed and weary as the players, a man who has lost his nerve and fallen predictably back in line. He did not have to go far. Kraft did not offer Trump another $1m for last year’s inauguration – according to Federal Election Commission filings, the slack was picked up by gambling titans DraftKings ($502,000) and FanDuel ($482,000) – but for all of his supposed outrage over January 6, there he was, dancing on stage with Trump, contributing to circuses even as the bread grows less affordable. Kraft has apparently made peace with the man who encouraged an attack on his own country, who swore he had nothing to with the violence, and then, once back in office, ordered the Department of Justice to settle with the family of Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed by police while trying to breach a window into the Capitol. Babbitt’s family wasawarded$5m and Babbitt posthumously restored full military honors by Trump, who thenimmediately pardonedroughly 1,500 of the convicted rioters.When he first arrived 33 years ago, Kraft captured the Boston fan’s heart. The humble everyman season-ticket holder not only rose from the metal benches of old Schaefer Stadium to own the team and keep it in Massachusetts, but transformed the lowly, dysfunctional, often highly comical Patriots into something no New Englander ever imagined: an A-list championship standard that would so eclipse the foundational, bedrock names of the sport – Dallas and Pittsburgh, Oakland and Miami – that his success and influence would be met with a staggeringly small vindictiveness, evidenced by him and his legendary coach, Bill Belichick,failing to be inductedto the Pro Football Hall of Fame this year.If his re-engagement with Trump may be forgiven as an innocuous example of pragmatic politics, it is not. Kraft certainly is a businessman first, and like most businessmen, he has been politically bipartisan, supporting Democratic candidates – including Barack Obama for president – as well as Republicans locally and nationally. By celebrating Trump, however, he has enjoined something more darker and less credible as the times darken and America deludes itself into believing today’s moment is merely uncomfortable for some, triumphant for others, but not defining. Kraft embodies a newer, far less heroic role that is nevertheless appropriate for an increasingly cynical world. He is the transactional billionaire, cynical possessor of fluid standards and dubious associations who may sometimes stand for something, but in the end, like so many of the rest, fell once again for Trump.Howard Bryant’s latest book is Kings and Pawns: Jackie Robinson and Paul Robeson in America from Mariner Books.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsNew England PatriotsSuper BowlDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Decisions on recruitment, spending and strategy sit with those clubs, within a financial framework designed to ensure sustainability and competitive balance. That framework applies equally across the league.“Cristiano has been fully engaged with Al-Nassr since his arrival and has played an important role in the club’s growth and ambition. Like any elite competitor, he wants to win. But no individual – however significant – determines decisions beyond their own club.“Recent transfer activity demonstrates that independence clearly. One club strengthened in a particular way. Another chose a different approach. Those were club decisions, taken within approved financial parameters.View image in fullscreenKarim Benzema of Al-Hilal after scoring the opening goal in a 6-0 win against Al-Okhdoud on Thursday.Photograph: Yasser Bakhsh/Getty Images“The competitiveness of the league speaks for itself. With only a few points separating the top four, the title race is very much alive. That level of balance reflects a system that is working as intended.“The focus remains on football – on the pitch, where it belongs – and on maintaining a credible, competitive competition for players and fans.”Transfer funds are understood not to come not from the PIF but from a player acquisition fund.The fund is overseen by the Saudi Pro League centrally and provides funding for clubs annually based on their size, with the country’s big four - Al-Nassr, Al-Hilal, Al-Ittihad and Al-Ahli - all believed to have received roughly the same amount before the summer transfer window last year.Al-Nassr spent big in that window – signing João Félix and Kingsley Coman as well as re-signing Ronaldo on a deal to June 2027.That is understood to have used up much of their player acquisition money until they receive another tranche of cash before the 2026 summer window opens.Al-Hilal’s signing of Benzema, who scored a hat-trick on debut for Al-Hilal in a 6-0 win against Al-Okhdoud on Thursday, was financed separately by a private investor.Despite the uncertainty over his availability for Friday night’s match, Al-Nassr published a glowing birthday tribute to their star man on Thursday.“The legend only grows.

With one hockey gamealready postponed because of norovirus, Olympic organizers could have been forgiven for hoping to avoid any other sudden waves of nausea inside the secondary rink across town.Vance is in Italy to lead the official US delegation at Friday’s opening ceremony, joined by second lady Usha Vance, Rubio and billionaire Tilman Fertitta, the US ambassador to Italy and owner of the NBA’s Houston Rockets. The group watched Thursday’s game from the second and third rows at center ice behind the scorer’s table alongside Olympic gold medal-winning hockey sisters Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson and Monique Lamoureux-Morando.Winter Olympics 2026: all your questions about the Milano Cortina Games, answeredRead moreMaybe it was the roughly four dozen US Secret Service agents forming something close to a Roman testudo around Vance’s party that tempered any potential negative reception. More likely, it was the far more seductive phenomenon of celebrity gravity. Nearly everyone within eyesight of the vice-president – including volunteers, arena staff, private security and working media – appeared to have a phone raised, recording the moment as he made his way to his seat.The US Olympic delegation in Milan – which also includes organizers involved in planning the 2034 Winter Games in Utah – is operating in what officials privately describe as a heightened diplomatic posture, aware the Games function as bothsporting event and global political stage.Both Vance and Rubio are expected to attend Friday night’s opening ceremony at the San Siro. Olympic officials have quietly expressed hope the ceremony will unfold without political demonstrations directed at American athletes or officials.Some of that concern stems fromItalian political reaction to reportsthat analysts connected to an agency within the US immigration enforcement structure would be present at the Games in an advisory capacity. Italian interior minister Matteo Piantedosi said those personnel would not perform any law enforcement role on Italian streets, dismissing criticism of their presence as politically driven.View image in fullscreenSecretary of state Marco Rubio and vice-president JD Vance met with US athletes on Thursday.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersAny fears of spectators jeering the Star-Spangled Banner were effectively moot Thursday afternoon. Neither anthem was played before the preliminary round game between the United States and the Czech Republic. Had they been, Vance would likely have missed them; he arrived midway through the first period.It was less clear whether the arena DJ was having a bit of fun when a techno remix of the Trump campaign anthem YMCA played moments before the United States took the ice in their crisp blue jerseys.Not long after the US contingent settled into their seats, Vance rose to applaud when Alex Carpenter scored the opening goal for the Americans. Lynyrd Skynyrd’s Free Bird blasted across the arena sound system as US fans stood and waved flags.Anticipation of a vocal crowd reaction to the high-profile political presence had largely failed to materialize. Ticket-holders showed little response when Vance and Rubio slipped into the stands midway through the first period. At one point, Vance was seen quietly joining fans in a chant of “U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!”On the ice, the Americans appeared largely unaware of the moment unfolding behind them. Veteran forwardHilary Knightsaid afterward she and her teammates did not notice Vance’s arrival.For long stretches, the day felt closer to Olympic theater than geopolitics. Earlier Thursday, Vance and his wife arrived in Milan ahead of Friday’s opening ceremony. According to the vice-president’s office, he is scheduled to meet Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni during the visit.Vance arrived wearing a blue zip-up jacket with a US flag patch on the sleeve and was greeted by Fertitta on the tarmac at Malpensa Airport. Usha Vance wore a white fleece featuring the Stars and Stripes across the back alongside the Olympic rings. Television footage showed the couple being welcomed by a group of American athletes waiting nearby, several applauding as they stepped off the plane.Pipe leaks and puck joy: Milan’s winter wasteland comes alive for ice hockey openerRead moreSpeaking with athletes shortly afterward, Vance framed the Olympics as a rare national unifier, telling competitors Americans across the political spectrum were rallying behind them. “The whole country – Democrat, Republican, Independent – we’re all rooting for you,” he said. “We’re cheering for you, and we know you’re going to make us proud.”He joked that while the second lady is not typically a sports fan, she becomes fully absorbed in the Olympics every two years and insists they watch together, something he said had been true since they first started dating. The anecdote, he suggested, reflected the Games’ ability to capture the attention of people who otherwise pay little attention to sport.Rubio joined the couple shortly afterward. The group paused for photographs before departing for Olympic meetings and venue visits.Earlier in the day, Vance also met members of several US freestyle skiing teams, greeting athletes individually, placing credential passes around several necks and asking where they were from. He told athletes he had taken up skiing in recent years and asked what they were most excited about heading into the Games. After brief conversations, the group posed for photos.Inside the arena later that afternoon, though, the focus remained on hockey. The US women controlled early play against the Czechs, pushing possession deep into the offensive zone and generating sustained pressure before closing out a 5-1 victory. Vance, seated with his wife and three children, alternated between watching the ice and scanning the crowd, the posture of a visiting dignitary aware he was being watched almost as closely as the game itself.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Olympic GamesJD VanceUS sportsWinter OlympicsUSA Olympic teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thursday, however, surely marked the first time it was asked whether ski jumpers were injecting their penises with hyaluronic acid in order to fly further.TheWadapresident Witold Banka’s reaction? “Ski jumping is very popular in Poland [Banka’s home country] so I promise you I’m going to look at it,” he said, with a wry smile.Heated rivalries and curling couples: 10 things to look out for at the Winter OlympicsRead moreAs crazy as it sounds, there are broader concerns surrounding this issue – which has been dubbed “Penisgate” – after they were first reported by the German newspaper Bild.Last year two of Norway’s Olympic medallists, Marius Lindvik and Johann André Forfang, were given three-month suspensions after the team was found to have secretly adjusted the seams of their suits around the crotch area at the 2025 World Ski Championships.Norway’s head coach Magnus Brevik, assistant coach Thomas Lobben, and staff member Adrian Livelten were also banned for 18 months for their involvement in the scheme, which made the jumpers’ suits larger and therefore reduced their descent rate due to the bigger wingspan.One study in the scientific journal Frontiers found that every 2cm in suit size circumference reduced drag by 4% and increased lift by 5%. It said that a 2cm change in the suits was equivalent to an extra 5.8 metres in jump length.However Bild has now claimed that jumpers have switched to other methods to game the system when they are measured for their suits, data for which is taken by a 3D scanner from the lowest point of their genitals. They include injecting acid into their penises or putting clay in their underwear to make their measurements temporarily bigger and therefore their suits looser for when they compete.The newspaper quoted a doctor, Kamran Karim, who said: “It is possible to achieve a temporary, visual thickening of the penis by injecting paraffin or hyaluronic acid. Such an injection is not medically indicated and is associated with risks.”These extraordinary rumours are yet to have been matched with any hard proof, although under Wada rules a method that endangers the health of an athlete and goes against the spirit of sport would be banned.Asked about the rumours, Olivier Niggli, the director general of Wada, said: “I’m not aware of the details of ski jumping – and how this can improve – but if anything was to come to the surface we would look at anything if it is actually doping related.“We don’t do other means of enhancing performance but our list committee would certainly look into whether this would fall into this category. But I hadn’t heard about that until you mentioned.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsWadaDrugs in sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The women’s preliminary Group B match between Italy and France will get under way in five minutes! And the question is: Are! You! Ready! For! Hockey?!” Well, quite.That had been the question for the past five months, as it happens, ever since it first became obvious that construction of Milan’s new Santagiulia arena was running massively behind schedule. At the test event last month the ice was grey because there was so much building dust in it, and midway through the match a man had to come on to the rink to repair a melted patch with a watering can.So what was the answer at last? Well, it depends on how you define “ready”. As the International Olympic Committee’s executive director for the games, Christophe Dubi, admitted a couple of days ago: “Do we have every single space in that venue finished? No.”View image in fullscreenSpectators approach the arena, in a currently underdeveloped part of Milan awaiting reconstruction.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThere were a lot of half-built concession desks and dangling wires, the construction dust was so thick that shoes left tread outlines on the concrete, and some of the water pipes were leaking into the press room. But they had an ice sheet, 12,000 or so full seats, and someone even turned up with a bucket to catch the drips, which, when it comes down to it, was really all they needed.Heated rivalries and curling couples: 10 things to look out for at the Winter OlympicsRead moreThere hasn’t been an Olympic Games yet that hasn’t been plagued by questions about whether or not everything would be ready on time, but even by those standards the Italians have cut it fine. They had a team going around the toilets at Santagiulia putting plastic mats into all the urinals during the breaks between periods. No one had got around to filling the soap dispensers. Or wiring up the pumps on the drinks machines. Or putting up permanent lighting along the escalators. Or finishing the paint work.Ten days before the game the man in charge of the ice, Don Moffatt, said it was “50/50” whether they would be able to get a game on. They did, which is a hell of a credit to Moffatt and his team, who have been working 12-hour shifts to do it. And it was a good one too. A crowd came out, made a hell of a lot of noise, and had a high old time. Even in the north of Italy ice hockey is a minority sport and, after qualifying automatically as hosts, they are the lowest ranked team in the women’s competition. But they enjoyed a famous victory, beating France 4-1.View image in fullscreenFrance’s Jade Barbirati (centre) slams into Manuela Heidenberger (left) and is sent to the sin-bin.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIf you were watching it on TV, you wouldn’t even have known anything was wrong. The exterior cameras had been positioned in just such a way to cut out the vast brown industrial wasteland that surrounds the arena.Santagiulia isn’t really a hockey project at all. Milan doesn’t need, or want, a permanent venue for a sport hardly anyone here plays or watches. Hosting this tournament was just the price they had to pay to unlock the funding and permission they needed to redevelop this entire district around the new arena, which has been designed by the British firm David Chipperfield.Come back here in a decade and the place will be unrecognisable. There are plans for 3,400 new homes, a park, and a shopping mall. By then the hockey rink will be long gone, repurposed for use as a concert hall.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsIce hockeyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Withreturning superstars, brand-new events and Italy leaning hard into its Olympic heritage, these Games may feel like they’ve arrived quietly – but there is a lot going on. From how and when to watch, to who matters and why these Olympics could look very different, here are your most pressing questions answered.Wait – there’s an Olympics happening?Yes. The 2026 Winter Olympics officially start on Friday and run through 22 February. Given where they land in a crowded sports calendar – withSuper Bowl LX on Sunday, the Premier Leaguein full swingand theAustralian Open having just finished– and considering it’s been less than 18 months since the Paris Summer Games ended, it’s easy to see how the Games might have snuck up on some fans.When do the Winter Olympics start?The Games officially begin on Friday with the opening ceremony, though several competitions will already be under way before then, including curling, ice hockey, luge, ski jumping, snowboarding and figure skating. As the Winter Olympics have grown – with longer schedules, more athletes and heavier broadcast demands – starting certain events early has become the only way to fit everything into the official Games window.Who is hosting the Winter Olympics?Italy is hosting the 2026 Winter Olympics. The Games are officially branded Milano Cortina 2026 and are spread across northern Italy, with Milan serving as the primary city host and Cortina d’Ampezzo anchoring the mountain events.What are the main Winter Olympics venues and locations?These Olympics are spread across northern Italy, with events clustered by geography and sport. Milan will host most of the indoor ice competitions – including ice hockey, figure skating and speed skating – and will also stage the opening ceremony. Cortina d’Ampezzo is the centerpiece for alpine events, hosting alpine skiing along with the sliding disciplines. Snowboarding and freestyle skiing will take place in Livigno. Biathlon events are based in Antholz, while ski mountaineering will be contested across multiple Alpine mountain courses designed for uphill-and-downhill racing.Olympic venues mapThis feels unusually spread out. Is it?Yes. Organizers have described it as the most geographically dispersed Winter Olympics ever. The upside is scenery and sustainability; the downside is complicated travel and logistics for athletes, media and fans.Why Italy, and why now?Italy last hosted the Winter Olympics in Turin in 2006, whileCortina d’Ampezzo hosted in 1956– the first Winter Games broadcast to an international audience. Milano Cortina leans heavily into that history while emphasizing existing venues, iconic mountain settings and fewer purpose-built stadiums.Where can I watch the opening ceremony?The opening ceremony takes place on 6 February at the San Siro stadium in Milan. In the US, it will air live on NBC and stream on Peacock, with primetime replays later that evening. In Australia you can watch on the Nine Network and Nine Now or stream it on Stan Sport. The BBC and CBC are the host broadcasters in the UK and Canada respectively. And, of course, the Guardian will be live blogging the ceremony – and the entire Games – for the next few weeks.Will Céline Dion be performing again?No, sorry to say. Instead, Mariah Carey is scheduled to headline. She will be joined by pianist Lang Lang, mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, tenor Andrea Bocelli, pop star Laura Pausini, and actors Pierfrancesco Favino, Sabrina Impacciatore and Matilda De Angelis. Organizers say the ceremony’s theme, Armonia (Italian for “harmony”), will focus on Italian culture, history and the country’s connection to the Olympic movement.View image in fullscreenMariah Carey is seen arriving at the airport on Monday ahead of the Milano Cortina Olympic games where she is set to perform at the opening ceremony.Photograph: Civetta/GC ImagesWhere can I watch the Winter Olympics 2026 online?Peacock is the main streaming destination in the US, offering live feeds, replays and event-specific streams across all sports.Will the time difference be an issue for audiences in North America?Not really. Italy is six hours ahead of the US east coast, meaning many finals will air live in the morning or early afternoon and replay in prime time. It’s a much friendlier schedule than the past two Winter Games in Asia.How do I find the Winter Olympics 2026 schedule?The timings for every Winter Olympic event can be foundhere.How is Team USA looking?The US has named a 232-athlete roster with an almost even gender split (117 men, 115 women). Ages range from 15-year-old freeskier Abby Winterberger to 54-year-old curler Rich Ruohonen.What are the big US storylines heading in?Besides Mariah Carey? Lindsey Vonn is attempting a remarkable comeback at 41 on her favorite mountainwith a completely ruptured ACL, while Mikaela Shiffrin chases redemptionafter a difficult Beijing Games. Speed skater Jordan Stolz is targeting a rare treble in the 500m, 1000m and 1500m. Ilia Malinin, America’sQuad God, is hotly tipped to win figure skating gold on the strength of his quadruple Axel, the dangerous four-and-a-half-revolution jumpno other skater in historyhas landed in competition. The US women’s figure skating teamdubbed the Blade Angels– led by Amber Glenn, Alysa Liu and Isabeau Levito – is chasing the country’s first women’s singles gold since 2002.View image in fullscreenSpeed skating sensation Jordan Stolz could become the second American to earn three gold medals at a single Winter Olympics.Photograph: Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty ImagesWho else should casual fans recognize?Chloe Kim, atwo-time Olympic gold medalistand one of the Games’ biggest crossover stars, is bidding for a historic third straight halfpipe gold amid injury concerns. Jessie Diggins and Alex Ferreira are also multiple-time medalists. Speed skater Erin Jackson, who became thefirst Black woman to win goldin any individual event at the Winter Games by winning the 500m in Beijing, will be defending her title.How about non-US stories?The return of NHL playersfor the first time since 2014means global superstars such as Connor McDavid, Sidney Crosby and the deep European powers will turn the Olympic tournament into something closer to a Stanley Cup-level competition. On home ice, Italy have multiple emotional centerpieces: ice dancers Charlene Guignard and Marco Fabbri chasing a long-elusive Olympic medal in what is likely their final Games, and short-track legend Arianna Fontana attempting an extraordinary double by racing both short track and long track.Elsewhere, Norway’s Johannes Høsflot Klæbo arrives chasing cross-country immortality with a potential multi-gold sweep. In sliding sports, the married skeleton duo of Belgium’s Kim Meylemans and Brazil’s Nicole Silveira are both realistic medal threats for nations that have never reached the Olympic podium in the event. And in curling, Italy’s defending mixed-doubles champions Amos Mosaner and Stefania Constantini return to compete in Cortina, at a historic venue, with the pressure and opportunity of defending gold in front of a home crowd.Which countries usually dominate the Winter Olympics?A small group of countries consistently dominates the Winter Games. Norway leads historically, driven by cross-country skiing, biathlon and Nordic combined, where medal opportunities are plentiful. Germany excels across biathlon and sliding sports like luge and bobsleigh. The United States thrives in alpine skiing, snowboarding and freestyle events, often peaking with generational stars. Canada is strongest in ice sports, particularly hockey and speed skating. Austria, Sweden and Switzerland round out the usual suspects, reflecting how climate, culture and deep development systems shape Winter Games success.What sports are in the Winter Olympics?There are 16 Winter Olympic disciplines, including alpine skiing, biathlon, bobsleigh, cross-country skiing, curling, figure skating, freestyle skiing, ice hockey, luge, Nordic combined, short track speed skating, skeleton, ski jumping, ski mountaineering, snowboarding and speed skating.Are there any new sports at the Winter Olympics?Yes. Ski mountaineeringmakes its Olympic debut.Skinning, boot-packing and downhill skiing: welcome to skimo at the Winter OlympicsRead moreWhat is ski mountaineering?Ski mountaineering blends uphill endurance racing with downhill speed. Athletes climb steep alpine terrain using skins attached to their skis, then descend at race pace. Long popular in Europe, it enters the Olympic program for the first time in 2026.Anything new within familiar sports?New medal events include dual moguls in freestyle skiing, men’s and women’s doubles in luge (replacing the open doubles event), team alpine combined for men and women, women’s large hill ski jumping, plus a mixed team relay in skeleton.What events should casual fans prioritize?Downhill skiing, figure skating, snowboard halfpipe and speed skating have typically been the blue-riband events, at least from the American perspective. And, later, ice hockey once the knockout rounds begin.Is the Winter Olympics hockey rink really smaller than the NHL?Yes – slightly. The main hockey rink in Milan is smaller than a standard NHL surface, which could lead to faster play, tighter spacing and more physical games, particularly in the medal rounds.View image in fullscreenA general view of the work at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena on Thursday, one week before the start of the competitions of the Winter Games.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesIs Russia in the Winter Olympics?Yes – but only in limited form. Russian athletes are allowed to compete only as Individual Neutral Athletes.What does neutral status actually mean?Neutral athletes cannot compete under Russia’s flag, wear national symbols or hear their anthem if they win. Team sports such as hockey are excluded entirely, meaning no Alexander Ovechkin or other Russian NHL stars. Athletes must also pass strict eligibility checks set by the International Olympic Committee, including showing they have not publicly supported the war in Ukraine or had ties to military or security services.Russian officials have suggested as many as 15 to 20 could qualify, though far fewer have been approved so far. The total is expected to be lower than the 15 who competed at the Paris Olympics.What’s the Olympic village like?Milano Cortina 2026 will not have a single Olympic village. Instead, organizers are using a decentralised, six-village model spread across northern Italy, reflecting the wide geographic spread of venues. Athletes will be housed in villages in Milan, Cortina d’Ampezzo, Livigno, Bormio, Predazzo and Anterselva, using a mix of new construction, temporary structures and existing hotels.The largest purpose-built site is in Milan’s Porta Romana district, where a new village will later be converted into student housing. In Cortina, athletes will stay in a temporary village of 377 mobile homes housing about 1,400 people, located north of town. The units are compact and functional, with shared facilities and exposure to alpine weather, and will be dismantled after the Games. Most teams plan to use the villages, though Norway has opted to house its athletes in hotels instead.Do they really have a lot of sex in there?Yes, but it’s more mundane than the legend suggests. The Olympic Villagehas a long-running reputationas a hookup hotspot, and there’s some truth to it: thousands of young, elite athletes in close quarters, away from home, riding adrenaline highs. Organizers don’t discourage it – free condomsare a standard fixture– but the reality is lessCaligulaand morecollege dorm during finals week. Many athletes are exhausted, intensely focused on competition or sleeping at odd hours, and teams often impose curfews, room rules and monitoring, especially before events.Milano Cortina’s decentralized setup may further temper the lore. With athletes split across six villages – from dense urban Milan to remote alpine bases – there’s no single social epicenter. Some competitors avoid the Village entirely until they’re finished competing, others bring partners or family, and most are far more concerned with recovery, routines and avoiding illness than living out the stereotype. Sex happens, but for most Olympians it’s a side note, not the point.How much do tickets cost for the Winter Olympics?Prices vary widely. Some early-round events start at under €30, while high-demand events such as figure skating finals and hockey medal games can cost several hundred euros.Will ICE agents be at the Winter Olympics?Yes, but with limits. A small unit from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement will have a security support role at the Milan–Cortina Winter Olympics, US and Italian officials have confirmed. ICE agents from its investigative arm, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), will assist the US State Department’s Diplomatic Security Service and liaise with Italian authorities on threats such as transnational crime.1:58Why are ICE agents going to the Winter Olympics in Italy? – video explainerThey will not carry out immigration enforcement or police operations, and all security remains under Italian control. Italian officials stressed the agents will work from operations rooms – including a US-run centre at the Milan consulate – rather than patrol streets or venues.The confirmation has sparked protests and political backlash in Italy, with critics calling ICE’s presence unacceptable. Several local leaders and opposition parties have launched petitions opposing the deployment. Italian ministers have sought to calm tensions, emphasising that ICE’s role is advisory and investigative, not operational.So, bottom line – why should I care?Because Milano Cortina brings together star power, history and real competitive stakes in a way the last Winter Games in Beijing – staged largely in empty venues because of Covid – simply couldn’t. This is shaping up to feel like a full, proper Olympics again.This article was amended on 5 February 2026.

Now, at 36, she’s arrived in Milan chasing one more Olympic gold before bringing down the curtain on one of the most influential careers the game has known.The Olympic women’s hockey tournament opens on Thursday with the United States bringing one of their youngest and fastest teams in years – and their longest-tenured player in the captain’s sweater. Only 11 players return from the teamthat won silver in Beijingfour years ago. Seven are still in college. Many developed inside a professional structure that did not exist for most of Knight’s career, shaped by the emergence of the Professional Women’s Hockey League and the broader surge in investment across women’s sports.Quick Guide2026 US Olympic women's hockey teamShowScheduleAll times Eastern.Thu 5 FebUSA v Czechia, 10.40am (USA Network)Sat 7 FebUSA v Finland, 10.40am (USA Network)Mon 9 FebSwitzerland v USA, 2.40pm (USA Network)Tue 10 FebCanada v USA, 2.10pm (USA Network)Fri 13 FebQuarter-final v TBD, 3.10pm (TBD)*Mon 16 FebSemi-final v TBD, 10.40am (TBD)*Thu 19 FebBronze-medal game v TBD, 8.40am (TBD)*Thu 19 FebGold-medal game v TBD, 1.10pm (TBD)**-if necessaryRoster breakdownThe 2026 US Olympic women's ice hockey team features 23 players, 13 forwards, seven defenders and three goaltenders, and boasts 21 returnees from the 2025 US women's national teamthat took home goldat the 2025 IIHF Women's World Championship in April.

Canada return much of the core that dominated the 2022 Olympics, led by point-gobbling captain Marie-Philip Poulin, widely considered the best player on the planet. The two countries have traded world titles often enough in recent years that neither side is comfortable claiming control of the rivalry for long. The Americans arrive after sweeping four games against their border rivals late last year, outscoring them 24-7, but inside the US program those results are treated as temporary data points, not verdicts. Rivalry Series defeats from earlier cycles – stretches when, as coach John Wroblewski once put it, the Americans “weren’t even getting the puck” – remain part of the program’s collective memory.Around Milan, the Games themselves are still snapping into place. Workers were finishing sections of the main Santa Giulia hockey arena less than 24 hours before fans were due to arrive. On the opposite side of the city center, the secondary Rho rink stands as a temporary structure of walkways, scaffolding and curtains, a reminder that the Olympic machine is designed to assemble quickly and disappear just as fast.For Knight, that volatility rings familiar. Olympic tournaments, she has learned, reset everything. “It’s a clean slate every time you get to a tournament,” she said after Tuesday’s practice at the Rho arena. “You have to work hard.”If there is a moment when Knight allows herself to step back and consider what five Olympics means, she has not admitted to it yet.View image in fullscreenHilary Knight of the United States speaks to reporters on Tuesday at Milano Rho Ice Hockey Arena ahead of her fifth Winter Olympic Games.Photograph: Bruce Bennett/Getty ImagesTo understand why Knight still matters to this team – and why she has mattered to American hockey for nearly 20 years – requires stepping outside statistics. On paper, the résumé is overwhelming. Ten world championship gold medals. Four Olympic medals, includinggold at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games. Records for goals, assists and points at the IIHF Women’s World Championship. The first player ever to surpass 100 career points in the tournament. The inaugural IIHF Female Player of the Year.But inside the dressing room, those numbers are rarely the first thing teammates mention. Instead, they talk about presence. About steadiness. About knowing the emotional rhythm of an Olympic tournament and how quickly it can shift.She spent much of her life in Sun Valley, Idaho, before a prolific collegiate career at the University of Wisconsin. Her family still lives in the mountain town a few hours east of Boise, a place she has often returned to between Olympic cycles and seasons scattered across North America and Europe.Her path to the sport would never be described as conventional. As a child, she played on boys’ teams, developing in environments where size, pace and physicality were non-negotiable. Later, at Choate Rosemary Hall in Connecticut, she trained in one of the country’s strongest prep hockey programs, sharpening a competitive edge that would carry into the national team.View image in fullscreenHilary Knight plays with the Seattle Torrent in the three-year-old Professional Women’s Hockey League.Photograph: Steven Garcia/Getty ImagesKnight has never framed leadership as dominance or authority. She talks about it instead as accumulated experience – years of trial and error, of learning how to communicate with different personalities, of recognizing when to stay quiet and when to push a room forward. She has often described her role less as leading from the front than making sure the next generation does not have to learn every lesson the hard way.That approach reflects the environment she came up in. When Knight entered the national team program, women’s hockey existed largely along the quadrennial rhythm of the Olympic cycle. Professional leagues appeared and disappeared. Players trained for world championships and the Winter Games, then scattered across semi-professional teams, overseas contracts and short-term opportunities.For years, pushing for structural investment felt like, as Knight describes it, “yelling into a void”. The infrastructure that now exists – youth development pipelines, stable professional leagues, broadcast visibility – is the result of years of pressure from players who were competing at the highest level while simultaneously trying to convince the sports world they deserved a permanent place inside it.The launch of the PWHL three years ago marked a turning point. For Knight and many of her peers, it felt less like the birth of something new than proof that something viable had always existed. She tends to describe women’s sports growth as interconnected – success in one league expanding possibility across others – part of a broader shift in how women’s sport is consumed, marketed and funded globally.If her generation fought to create space, the generation now entering the Olympic roster is growing up inside it. That difference is visible in the players surrounding her in Milan: faster, more creative, more willing to experiment stylistically, less constrained by the scarcity mindset that shaped earlier eras of the sport.Knight talks about watching them with something closer to excitement than nostalgia. The evolution, she believes, is exactly what women’s hockey needed. “I’m so excited for them to just take the helm and steer this ship forward,” she said.Her own career has mirrored that transition. Early Olympic cycles were about validation – proving the sport belonged. Later cycles became about growth – proving it could sustain itself professionally. Now, for the first time, she is entering an Olympic tournament knowing that a full professional ecosystem will still be there when the Games end. That shift has changed how she thinks about legacy and success.Her definition of accomplishment has expanded beyond medals. It now includes the people who helped make those moments possible: teammates, families, coaches, trainers, the network of support that exists behind every Olympic performance.That perspective, in some ways, traces back to her first memory of the Games. In 1998, when women’s hockey debuted at the Olympics at Nagano, Knight was a little girl jumping on a friend’s couchcelebrating the US gold medal. She does not remember the game itself. She remembers the feeling – the sense that something enormous and shared was happening all at once. The moment helped shape how she understands Olympic sport now: not just as competition, but as something capable of reaching people who may never step on a rink.Years later, that understanding deepened again in Beijing in 2022, when strict Covid protocols isolated athletes from families and support systems. The experience sharpened her sense of how many people share Olympic moments behind the scenes – and how different the Games can feel when that connection is removed.Privately, she has begun to process what this Olympic cycle represents. Not as a dramatic farewell, but as a recognition of completeness. She has described reaching a place where her “heart feels really whole”, where the focus shifts from chasing achievements to absorbing the experience itself.That’s given shape to how she approaches Milan. Less like a final chapter, more like a final opportunity to experience something she has spent most of her life pursuing.View image in fullscreenHilary Knight, right and Kendall Coyne celebrate after defeating Canada in a shootout in the Olympic gold-medal game at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.Photograph: Harry How/Getty ImagesThe United States open the preliminary round on Thursday against the Czech Republic ahead of a group-stage date with the Canadians on Tuesday – and what many expect will be a second meeting with their northern neighbors in the knockout stage.The rivalry has shaped Knight’s career as much as any single championship, defined by infinitesimal margins, momentum swings, white-knuckle tension and the knowledge that neither side remains on top for very long. Most likely, at some point over the next two weeks, it will come down to their most familiar foes again. It almost always does. “When the puck drops, your heart is beating out of your chest,” Knight said of facing Canada. “You’re like, ‘Am I human? This is insane. This is awesome.’”In the coming days, she will take faceoffs in buildings that were still being finished this week, skating alongside teammates young enough to have grown up watching her Olympic runs. But the significance of the tournament runs deeper than standings or podiums. It is also a marker of how far the sport has moved during the span of her career and how much further it may still go.For nearly two decades, she has been the connective tissue between generations of American players. In Milan, she becomes something else as well: a living transition point between what the sport was and what it is becoming.And somewhere, she knows, another kid is watching – maybe not understanding the systems or rivalries or history, maybe not remembering the game itself – but feeling the scale of the moment. For Knight, that has always been the part that endures.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Ice hockeyUSA Olympic teamUS sportsWinter OlympicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is only fitting that the one sport played every single day of theWinter Olympicsis the one that opens proceedings at Milano Cortina. Dubbed “chess on ice”, curling may not have the brute force of ice hockey or the airtime of snowboarding, but it is a huge test in precision, patience and handling pressure.Enter mixed doubles, which has its own subplot straight out of a romcom, with husband-and-wife pairings representing Norway, Canada and Switzerland. Norway’s Kristin Skaslien and Magnus Nedregotten came up against familiar foes on Wednesday, having edged Great Britain’s Jennifer Dodds and Bruce Mouat in a semi-final thriller at Beijing 2022, sealing victory with the last stone.In the much-lower stakes rematch, Dodds and Mouat saw out a 8-6 victory to give Team GB a winning start to their Olympics. The Scottish pair looked unfazed by the early challenge of Nedregotten and Skaslien. Team GB led 4–3 at the break, were pegged back shortly after, but then seized the initiative in the sixth end when Dodds produced a superb shot to win three points.“It was a very back-and-forth game,” said Dodds. “It took us a minute to figure out one side of the ice was curling more than the other. We took the other side and had a lot better control, that’s when we took that step up in performance and controlled the game from there.”Norway narrowed the gap using the power play, but Mouat and Dodds responded in kind in the final end to seal victory. The result sets them up well for Thursday’s match against Estonia, who fell to a 9-7 defeat after an extra end against Switzerland in their curling debut at the Games.Four minutes into play, all four games came to a halt owing to a power outage at the Olympic Ice Stadium in Cortina, which was built for the 1956 Games. Officials briefly paused the matches after the lights dimmed and flickered but the lights came back on shortly after. “I didn’t mind the lights going off,” joked Mouat. “It was a bit of a boogie, a rave … it was like a nightclub.”Canada’s husband-and-wife pairing Jocelyn Peterman and Brett Gallant enjoyed a smoother outing than the Norwegians, defeating the Czech Republic’s Julie Zelingrova and Vit Chabicovsky 10–5. The Canadians surged into control early and Peterman’s precise draw for two in the fourth extended the advantage to 7–3 before the Czechs conceded after seven ends.Isabella and Rasmus Wranå, Sweden’s sibling duo, opened their campaign with a win over South Korea’s Kim Seon-yeong and Jeong Yeong-seok, though the match ended in unusual fashion. Sweden sealed the result by stealing four points before another stolen point in the sixth made it 10–3. Officials then brought the game to an early close, mistakenly believing seven ends had been completed despite South Korea seemingly hoping to continue for extra ice time.View image in fullscreenThe brother and sister duo Rasmus and Isabella Wranå of Sweden swept to a 10-3 win against South Korea.Photograph: Mathias Bergeld/Bildbyrån/ShutterstockMeanwhile, Great Britain’s hopes of winning multiple skeleton medals have been hit by apotential helmet banjust days before the start of competition.The British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association (BBSA) has lodged an appeal with the court of arbitration for sport (Cas) against a decision by the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) to outlaw the team’s new helmets.The BBSA is challenging the IBSF’s ruling that the helmets, which feature aerodynamic ridges, are not compliant with the sport’s existing regulations.

He wants to ensure he’s not the lastMelissa Jacobsin San FranciscoThu 5 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 5 Feb 2026 06.07 ESTShareMidway through the 2023NFLseason, Dallas Cowboys star edge rusher Micah Parsons was frustrated. Asked about the source – a feeling of being held by opponents all the time – Parsons credited his defensive line coach Aden Durde with keeping him in check.“[Coach Durde] pulled me aside and said, ‘You gotta remember, you’re Micah fucking Parsons,” he recalled. “‘This shit is going to happen. You just gotta keep going. Fuck all the other stuff.’”Durde is hardly the first NFL defensive coach to deliver a fiery pep talk, but he is the first to deliver it with an English accent. And come Sunday, Durde will be the first coach from the UK to grace the sidelines of a Super Bowl, when hisSeattle Seahawksface the New England Patriots.Sam Darnold: after five teams and plenty of mockery, ‘Ginger Cuz’ reaches the Super BowlRead moreSeahawks cornerback Devon Witherspoon both respects and gets a kick out of Durde, now in his second season as Seattle’s defensive coordinator.“His accent is pretty dope. I’m intrigued by it. I want to learn to talk like that,” said Witherspoon earlier this week. Witherspoon wasn’t comfortable attempting the accent outside the confines of the Seahawks locker room but excitedly offered a referral.Seahawks safety Coby Bryant lit up at the mere mention of Durde, who hails from north London. After nailing “we’re going to win the Super Bowl” in Durde’s accent, Bryant explained his kinship with his coordinator.“He’s the ultimate competitor,” Bryant said. “People say we’re similar. They think we’re serious and always about work. I respect how he always wants to get better.”To call Seattle’s defense better since Durde and head coach Mike Macdonald came to town two years ago is an understatement. The duo have transformed Seattle’s defense from 30th overall in 2023 to sixth this season. The juggernaut unit allowed a league-best 17.2 points per game, rightfully drawing comparisons to the punishingLegion of Boomof the mid-2010s. Macdonald calls the plays, while Durde works on implementation and individual player development. It’s a partnership that was born the moment they met.“Just listening to him talk about how he sees the game was very similar to how I saw it,” Macdonald said in 2024, “in terms of what you needed to do to be able to defend offenses these days, and he had some really interesting perspective. So we felt like, shoot, we gotta get this guy here in person. Brought him in, [he] did a great job and it just kind of took off from there.”View image in fullscreenUnder Aden Durde and head coach Mike Macdonald, Seattle’s defense has become one of the NFL’s best.Photograph: Lindsey Wasson/APLong before Durde was preparing to coach in the Super Bowl, he was just a kid in Middlesex who liked a different kind of football than most of his neighbors. He grew up a West Ham fan, but American football became his obsession.Well before streaming – and before four games, let alone one, were played in London each season – Durde watched whatever game was on Channel 4. He became a Chicago Bears fan, watching as a six-year-old as they won the 1985 Super Bowl. Childhood heroes such as Richard Dent and Mike Singletary were more than enough to reel him in.“I fell in love with football,” Durde told the Guardian. “One day me and a kid down my street decided we wanted to play so we did. We loved it and found a team.”The rest might not be history, though, had Durde not grown to have the frame for football. Even now at 46, Durde, who stands at 6ft 1in and 240lb, doesn’t appear to have missed many lifting days at the gym.The rest might also not be history, though, without an outlet to play. Durde joined the British American Football League, which was the primary way for Brits to play American football from 1998 to 2010. There he excelled as a linebacker for the London Olympians before moving on to NFL Europe. After the 2005 season, Durde was allocated to the Carolina Panthers as part of the NFL International Development Practice Squad program – an initiative he would later transform.It was a short-lived stint; Durde was released after testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug. He went on to play for the Hamburg Sea Devils of NFL Europe, before being invited back to the NFL as a preseason practice squad player for the 2008 Kansas City Chiefs.View image in fullscreenAden Durde (No 54) played with the Hamburg Sea Devils of NFL Europe.Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Bongarts/Getty ImagesDespite the opportunity, it was clear he wasn’t going to be the next Singletary, let alone land on a full-time NFL roster. He pivoted away from the world of football for a few years before he felt the itch to coach.From 2011 to 2016, he served as the defensive coordinator for the London Warriors working under Tony Allen, who is still considered one of the most influential forces for American football development in the UK. While it was clear Durde had a knack for motivating players, he kept any dreams of coaching at a higher level in check.“If you look ahead to something you want to get, you won’t be doing your job particularly well,” he said. “Just really enjoy what you do and let people notice you.”People took notice. From 2014 to 2015, Durde worked as a coaching intern with the Dallas Cowboys through the NFL fellowship program. It was coaching grunt work, but the experience and exposure would prove invaluable.Meet the NFL outsiders: the players and coaches not born in the USARead moreAfter his internship, Durde returned to London, where he worked as a director of football development at the NFL UK office. Serendipitously, the desk next to his was occupied by a new co-worker: two-time Super Bowl champion and fellow BritonOsi Umenyiora.“It was a very random thing, but we spoke about how we could elevate the game by finding international players. He wanted to do the same thing, and we found an opportunity to present it to Roger Goodell and we did,” Durde said.What began as NFL Undiscovered quickly morphed into theInternational Player Pathway (IPP), a program to identify elite global talent with the aim of offering selected athletes the opportunity to earn a spot on an NFL roster. Seventy international players have signed with NFL teams, with 22 IPP athletes currently on NFL rosters. Since 2017, 11 of these players have been elevated to active rosters, includingJordan Mailata, an Australian rugby player turned starting left tackle for the Super Bowl-winning Philadelphia Eagles.It was a different program that connected Durde with Dan Quinn, another key figure in Durde’s rise. Durde arrived in Atlanta in 2016 via the Bill Walsh Coaching Fellowship and quickly impressed Quinn, then the Falcons’ head coach. Quinn hired Durde as a defensive quality control coach two years later, making Durde the first British full-time coach in NFL history. He studied under Quinn, one of the league’s top defensive minds, for four seasons, rising to outside linebackers coach in 2020.View image in fullscreenAden Durde worked alongside head coach Dan Quinn, one of the NFL’s top defensive minds, with the Atlanta Falcons.Photograph: Carmen Mandato/Getty ImagesAfter being ousted in Atlanta, Quinn became the defensive coordinator in Dallas. Durde joined to coach the line and thrived – in that 2023 season, he helped Parsons record a career-high 14 sacks.Now days from coaching in the Super Bowl, Durde takes a quick break from the stoicism, calling his journey “surreal” and being here “crazy” before noting the games leading up to Sunday have also been important.He knows what it means to be the first British coach in the Super Bowl but wants to ensure he’s not the last. “Yeah, the more opportunity for more people to get seen is real. Look at how the game is growing internationally. That’s how I can see,” he said, “Why limit it?”Durde remains the only full-time British coach, but there is another up-and-comer in the league: His son Kane, a scouting assistant for the Cowboys.“He’s making his own path. I do my best job to not get involved in that,” Durde said. “He is doing his own thing, and he’s building his own way of doing things. I’m so proud of him.”Despite not being Seattle’s playcaller, Durde is a hot commodity. The Falcons and Browns interviewed him for their head coach openings. There is speculation that he’ll be asked to join Klint Kubiak’s staff in Las Vegas when the current Seahawks offensive coordinator is named Raiders head coach next week. Quinn, now head coach of the Commanders, may try to poach him too. His future is clearly bright.From Evil Empire to Super Bowl underdogs: is it OK to like the Patriots now?Read more“He’s just one of the best coaches I’ve played for. It’s just the way he motivates me, the way he allows me to play my style of football, makes me play comfortable,” Seahawks defensive tackle Leonard Williams told theSeattle Times last month. “After a while, he just breathes so much life into you that it just makes you feel confident as a player, makes you trust yourself, makes you trust your teammates, makes you trust your coaches.”This week, Durde is happily in the Bay Area, analyzing Seattle’s defensive Super Bowl plan for thePatriots, keeping his players on track and letting his serious but friendly demeanor keep him grounded. And while he’s focused on coverages and matchups, he knows if the Seahawks players are nervous or tight on Super Bowl Sunday, he can break out the secret weapon.“When I speak with more of an English accent, I think they laugh,” he said. “If you can help people do that, that’s what coaching’s about.”Explore more on these topicsSuper BowlSuper Bowl LXSeattle SeahawksNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A single person, making it crystal clear where they stand and what for, can be the light in the darkness that helps you navigate today’s turbulent waters.That’s why I’m so grateful forGianni Infantino. The man is the ultimate guide to geopolitics, and a waypost for anyone confused by the moral labyrinth they find themselves living in. Whichever way he’s pointing, you can feel confident you should be headed in the opposite direction.Take Russia’s ongoing exclusion from international events such as Fifa tournaments and the Olympic Games. The efficacy and implementation of sporting bans and boycotts may seem a near-impossible conundrum, to be debated by wiser heads than our own. Then this week you hearFifa’s president say he wants Russia’s ban liftedbecause “it has just created more … hatred”. And you remember that in Decemberhe awarded a peace prizeto a man who immediately seized a Venezuelan president and threatened to invade Greenland andattack Iran.IOC president gives clearest signal so far that Russia could be at 2028 OlympicsRead moreSo it’s helpful to remember the upside down nature of the times we’re living in – as well as the pusillanimous servility of those running some of the planet’s most powerful sporting organisations. Because otherwise it might be quite difficult to resist the plausible arguments to let Russia return to international competition, especially as they begin to be echoed back and forth between football and the Olympics.A day after Infantino’s comments, the International Olympic Committee president, Kirsty Coventry, gave a coded message to the same effect, insisting sport should be a “neutral ground” where athletes “compete freely, without being held back by the politics or divisions of their governments”. As statements go, it registers about as much shock value asLucas Paquetá’s return from West Hamto Brazil.At surface level, you can’t argue with the idea that sportspeople from different countries and cultures should be encouraged to forge relationship across the political barriers that divide them. The world does indeed need to recognise its shared humanity. And this was the same argument for granting Russia the 2014 Sochi Olympics, right beforeVladimir Putin turned it into an opportunityfor systemic state-sponsored doping, crackdowns on LGBT rights, and, oh yes, the annexing of Crimea.Coventry is vocal about the Olympics’ commitment to EDI, so presumably welcoming Russia back is a big tick for her equality, diversity and inclusivity agenda. After all, it’s not anyone’s fault if they’re born in a country with a belligerent authoritarian regime. Unless they’re the child of a United States immigrant, in which case it very much is their fault and they deserve to beseparated from their parents and detained.As for Infantino, he just wants everyone to know that sporting bans don’t work, which is obviously why Russia has been petitioning him so hard to lift theirs. Poor Gianni, he just wants everyone to get along. He still has theOrder of Friendshipthat Putin awarded him in 2019, after Russia had hosted the World Cup the year before. And what kind of a friend would you be if you gave up on someone just because they invaded a neighbouring country?One of the odder things that sport encourages us to do – along with standing in the winter cold en masse, screaming obscenities at people whose shirts are a different colour to ours – is to ask us to take it seriously. We outsource our moral judgment to its quasi-religious sense of neutrality. We believe that because it contains and focuses our most competitive, survivalist and even violent instincts within a 100-yard box, it raises us above our baser instincts and to a higher plane.On the field, everyone stands supposedly equal, even while committing themselves to codes and behaviours formed by European countries when they were still stealing other people’s land for the good of mankind.And as sport has commercialised into a mega-industry, there’s a correlative inflation of its spiritual – or humanist, as you prefer – significance. And that remains even as its own fixation on growth tips the balance of its purpose – from making money to function, to functioning to make money. The Olympics remains one of the greatest shows on Earth; but you can admire theathletes’ efforts in Milanthis month while remembering that even since the nadir ofSalt Lake, bribery and bid-rigginghas continued to dog the organisation that stages it.As for Fifa, one of the world’s most lucrative not-for-profit organisations, its recent history of corruption needs no letter of introduction – although a group of whistleblowers and academics did provide one last year. It argued the organisation iseven more poorly governed than it was a decade ago, when its officials were being arrested for fraud, racketeering and money laundering.In the meantime, they have actively hollowed out their own stated values, be those anti-discrimination, solidarity or human rights. They continue to give World Cups to nations where homosexuality is punishable by death and ban on-field LGBT+ advocacy. As for theexploitation of migrant workersduring the construction of the Qatar World Cup, well, in 2024Fifa rejected the adviceof its own committee to accept its part and help compensate them.The ultimate evidence of the hollowness of Fifa’s values is, of course, the frankly creepy gold bauble that Infantino presented to Donald Trump in lieu of the Nobel that his dear friend wanted. A man standing in front of an ugly naked guy, telling him he’s wearing the finest raiments. Let’s bear this in mind when the same man confidently tells us how playing youth football against Russia can help repair a geopolitical fracture threatening the stability of the entire planet.Sport’s soft power is curdling in the hands of its supposed leaders. Actual leadership requires people prepared to say the things that the powerful, the rich, and the committers of crimes don’t want to hear.This weekPep Guardiola has spoken passionatelyabout the horrors of conflict on innocent people, from Ukraine to Sudan to Palestine. The IOC and Fifa would rather not. You can’t trust politicians to do the right thing, says such silent, neutered morality. But here we can promise you that we will do absolutely nothing at all.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The McLaren driver believes his maiden triumph has only given him greater confidence in his ability.Norris won the championship after an intense competition that went to the wire. After a three-way fight with his teammate, Oscar Piastri, and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, Norris sealed the title by only two pointsat the final race of the seasonin Abu Dhabi.Wolff urges Mercedes rivals to ‘focus on themselves’ amid 2026 engine rowRead moreThe British driver has always been open about his approach to racing and admitted that, while he had already achieved his lifelong dream, that achievement did not blunt his determination to win another championship.“I still have many more years inFormula Oneand I will still try to get as many more championships as possible. If I never do, I’m so happy,” he said. “If I don’t achieve something again, I always have something that I’m very proud about. I know it’s a huge achievement but it certainly hasn’t taken away any ambition or desire to want to do it again.”Norris faced some accusations last year that he did not possess the killer instinct vital in a tough championship fight, especially when compared with his uncompromising rival Verstappen. Norris, however, stuck to his claims that he wanted to prove he could win it his way by being a fair and honest driver.He proved the doubters wrong but in the buildup to the new season – which starts in Melbourne on 8 March – faced the question of whether he had the same steel and ambition as his Red Bull rival to become a multiple winner.“It’s quite clear that I have a different mentality and a different approach to what Max has. Good or bad, you decide,” he said. “There’s a lot of things that I still admire in Max, and I wish I had a little bit more of that here and there. There’s still plenty of things I want to work on and I want to be better on. The baseline level of where I’m at now is already pretty good. My motivation to win is exactly the same.“If anything, I have more confidence. I’ve said in the past that I’m very much a guy who has to see something to believe in it. Did I believe I could be on pole for the first time or win a race? When I’ve done it, then I’ve gone: ‘Ah, I can do it.’ I have to find my own way and not disregard what other people have done in the past, but just understand what is always going to motivate me.”The task facing the 26-year-old is daunting. F1 is introducing a swathe of new regulations this season, drastically changing the cars and how they will be driven, alongside entirely new hybrid power units which will now utilise a 50-50 split in power generation between the internal combustion engine and electrical energy, which the drivers first experienced in pre-season testing in Barcelona last week.View image in fullscreenLando Norris revels in the moment he clinched his first world title with McLaren’s elated paddock staff.Photograph: Xavi Bonilla/DPPI/ShutterstockManaging how the McLaren’s electrical power is employed across a lap, including the use of a push-to-pass boost function, will play a major part and Norris believes it could fundamentally change F1 racing.“I think what you’re going to see is almost more chaotic racing, depending on when people use the boost button,” he said. “Create racing potentially in better ways than you have been able to in the past and that’s probably a good thing.”The extra energy employed needs to be recovered after use, allowing drivers the chance to come back at their rivals. “You’ll see more yo-yoing, more moves with extra speed,” Norris said. “You realise once you use the boost button how much that can hurt you on the next straight and how you have to get the battery back up quickly.“The biggest challenge at the minute is battery management and knowing how to utilise that in the best way. It’s not simple. You have a very powerful battery that doesn’t last very long. So knowing how to use it at the right times, how much energy, how much of that power you use, how you split that up around the lap. Our challenge as a team, as drivers, is all of these things. Our job is to try to be on top of that as much as possible.”The season’s second test takes place in Bahrain from Wednesday to Friday next week, with the final test a week later before the opening Australian Grand Prix.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2026Lando NorrisMcLarenMax VerstappenFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

When you warm up, you have your half, the other team have their half. I’ve never asked my team or my coaches to encroach on the opposition’s territory. In that moment, I didn’t think it was right where they were operating.“They were affecting my lads’ warm-up and my staff’s warm-up. So I asked them, maybe not politely, to make sure they stay in their half. I’m not here to have mind games. It’s just what I think is right and respectful. Hopefully, we respect that and other teams do too.“There are certain etiquettes in football. I always try to be as respectful as possible. I always want to win. I’ve never asked my coaches. I don’t have an issue with anyone at Arsenal Football Club. A fantastic manager, Mikel Arteta, I’ve got so much respect for. It was just in that moment, I didn’t think that respect was shown to my team.”Arsenal reached the final after a late Kai Havertz goal sealed a 4-2 win on aggregate.Chelseawere criticised for their cautious approach but were without a host of key players.Rosenior said that Cole Palmer, who came on in the second half against Arsenal, is ready to play 90 minutes when Chelsea visit Wolves in the Premier League on Saturday.

The punishment, determined by an independent disciplinary commission, leaves them outside the Championship relegation zone only on goal difference.A hearing took place in November after Leicester were alleged to have breached profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) for the three-season period ending with 2023-24. There were also two further charges against the club for failing to cooperate and failing to submit their financial accounts on time.Frank says Romero ‘dealt with internally’ for latest volley at Spurs ownersRead moreLeicester drop to 20th in theChampionship, level on points with West Bromwich Albion, who occupy the final relegation spot, and Blackburn.With Leicester outside the Premier League, the EnglishFootball Leagueissued the punishment with immediate effect. The EFL board met on Thursday to apply the sanction as per regulation 87.7 in its rules, which states the league “has the power to implement sanctions equivalent to those recommended by any independent Premier League commission or appeal board”.Leicester are considering an appeal. In a statement the club said: “It is with disappointment thatLeicester Cityacknowledges the independent commission’s decision and the club will use the time available to consider its next steps.”They deemed the penalty “disproportionate”, saying: “We are now reviewing the decision in full and considering the options available to us. We remain committed to engaging constructively and ensuring that any action is fair, proportionate and determined through the appropriate processes.”View image in fullscreenInterim manager Andy King will be in charge again this weekend when Leicester go to Birmingham.Photograph: John Mallett/ProSports/ShutterstockThe Premier League, which said the commission had recommended a six-point penalty, revealed that Leicester’s “improving financial position” across the period was used in mitigation during the week-long hearing.Leicester were found to have breached the relevant PSR threshold by £20.8m across the three-year period. The maximum permitted losses across the timeframe, taking in two seasons in the Premier League and one in the Championship, were £83m.The Premier League said: “The commission found that the club’s refusal to provide its annual accounts to the Premier League by the relevant deadline was a breach of Premier League rules.“It also dismissed a claim by the club that it had demonstrated exceptional cooperation throughout the proceedings. Following agreement by the parties, and consistent with the relevant guidelines, the commission agreed that the club’s improving financial position over the relevant assessment period was a mitigating factor.”Leicester, who have lost three of their past four league matches, are searching for a new head coach after sacking Martí Cifuentes last month, with their former midfielder Andy King – part of the squad that won the Premier League in 2016 – continuing in interim charge for Saturday’s trip to Birmingham. Leicester are close to appointing a technical director, to work alongside the longstanding director of football, Jon Rudkin, and a new chief executive.Cifuentes was removed from his role six months into a three-year contract. In a statement on Thursday, the Spaniard said: “From the moment me and my staff arrived we gave everything to try to help the club in building a fresh culture and set new standards during a challenging period … I wish everyone nothing but the best for what lies ahead in the future for your club.”Explore more on these topicsLeicester CityPremier LeagueChampionshipFootball LeagueFinancesnewsShareReuse this content"

The Premier League champions did move for the Netherlands international Geertruida, who is on loan at Sunderland from Leipzig and wanted the transfer, but the deal was called off because Sunderland were unable to secure a replacement.England’s late 2026 World Cup start gives FA headache over warm-up matchesRead moreSlot is without two defenders for the remainder of the season in Conor Bradley and Giovanni Leoni, and Jeremie Frimpong is sidelined with a hip injury. Joe Gomez has missed the past two games with a hip problem but could return to the bench against Manchester City on Sunday.TheLiverpoolhead coach believes his squad will improve but would struggle to withstand further injury setbacks. “I’m very happy with the squad, let that be clear,” Slot said. “But it’s obvious we have three long-term injuries. That’s why we tried to strengthen in the winter break and the player you mentioned, in the end, wasn’t available.“I think there’s more to come from this group of players for obvious reasons. Some reasons I probably blame myself for a bit, but some things I cannot do anything about: injuries, a player not ready to play three games a week. But it’s clear if we have an injury crisis, even more than we already have, then that makes things even more difficult. We have 16 players available and Trey [Nyoni] and Rio [Ngumoha] are two of them.“This squad is able to do better and more than we’ve done until now, in my opinion, but then they all need to stay available. That’s going to be a hell of a challenge because we have three games in seven days coming up.”Liverpool beat Chelsea to the signing of Jacquet, who was also coveted by Bayern Munich, and Slot insisted he agreed with the club’s longer-term transfer strategy. “I always want the best for the club even if in the short term it is not ideal for me,” he said. “I am not saying it is [not ideal] but if it means this, I would always go for the signing that is best for the club. I knew which club I went into. This club has a model of signing talented players younger. I have always liked to work in that way.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

He would not give any steer as to the outcome of Romero’s outburst – the second in two months – only saying: “We have dealt with the matter internally.”Cristiano Ronaldo warned by Saudi Pro League amid transfer spending disputeRead more“Cuti is a very passionate player and captain who wants to leave every­thing on the pitch,” said Frank. “He is very ambitious and wants to win every single time. Sometimes, when you are like that, you can have an outburst like this time but we have dealt with it internally.”Frank would not say whether any disciplinary action had been taken against Romero, though he did insist there “is always one line you can’t cross for any player” or “can’t cross too many times”.On the question of whether he will remain Spurs captain, Frank was able to answer more directly, ­however. “The answer is yes,” he said. “Leader­ship is many things. I’m 52 and I think I’m pretty good at leaders­hip but could I get better? Yes. Do I make mistakes every day? No, but probably weekly. Romero is 27 years old. He will still make mistakes going forward as a leader. Does he do a lot of good things? Yes.”Asked if Romero should have found another way to air his ­displeasure with the club’s transfer window ­business, with the player describing the size of the Spurs squad as “disgraceful”, Frank said: “I have said before that there are a lot of ways of doing things. Cuti has been very important for us this season and in past seasons and we need to be aware of that. But I wouldn’t have done it.”Romero posted on Instagram afterTottenham’s 2-2 draw with Manchester City, explaining he had played the match despite feeling unwell because there were only 11 players fit. The number was actually 13. “Great effort from all my teammates yesterday, they were all incredible,” he said. “I wanted to be available to help them even though I wasn’t feeling well, especially as we had only 11 players available – unbelievable but true and disgraceful.”View image in fullscreenThomas Frank believes too much emphasis is put on what is written on social media.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockThe post was liked by some of Romero’s teammates, including Pedro Porro, Djed Spence, Kevin Danso, Conor Gallagher, Pape Sarr, James Maddison and Dominic Solanke.Spurs made two signings during the window – Gallagher from Atlético Madrid for £34.6m and Souza, a 19-year-old left-back, from Santos for £13m. They sold Brennan Johnson to Crystal Palace for £35m.Frank defended the Spurs ownership, saying they were “very serious” in their ambitions for the club. “I speak with them, I am together with them so I am not in doubt,” he said. “I think it a little unfair, if not very unfair, to judge them on a January window. I understand there’s a lot of scrutiny but that would be unfair.”He said that a window in which Spurs added two senior signings, Gallagher and the Brazilian full-back Souza, was “very good” compared with other top flight teams “and for where we are it’s OK”.In January, afterdefeat by Bournemouth, Romero had posted a similar message,demanding ownership take more responsibilityfor the club’s performance. “At times like this, it should be other people coming out to speak, but they don’t – as has been happening for several years now,” he wrote. “They only show up when things are going well, to tell a few lies.” Romero later deleted the reference to lies.Frank spoke with Romero after the first post and publicly said the player had made a “mistake”. Asked whether repeating that mistake meant Romero had gone too far, the 52-year-old would not answer. “We’re dealing with it internally, that’s my main message tonight,” he said. On whether the reactions from his teammates meant other players shared his feelings on the ownership, Frank said: “We don’t know what a ‘like’ means.”The Dane said of social media: “I can’t get rid of it, it’s out there, but one thing I do know is that we all give it too much attention. It’s such a small number of people who are writing things out there and everything they write we take as truth. I think that’s a challenge overall.”Frank revealed that Micky van de Ven had returned to training and would be available for selection at Old Trafford, where Spurs meet Manchester United at lunchtime on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FranknewsShareReuse this content"

Previous deals in the league suggest it is a riskByWhoScoredHarry PatersonThu 5 Feb 2026 15.00 ESTShareAs Premier League teams get younger and transfer fees get bigger, we are seeing players with little experience commanding huge prices.Jérémy Jacquet’s £60m move to Liverpoolmakes him the fourth most expensive player aged 20 or younger in Premier League history. Spending so much money for a defender with just 36 appearances in France’s top flight looks like a risk, but how have players Jacquet’s age fared after big moves?Leny Yoro: £52.2m, 18 years oldFew clubs beat Real Madrid in a transfer battle for a young player, but Manchester United did just that in the summer of 2024, when they signed 18-year-old Leny Yoro. Born in Paris in 2005, Yoro joined Lille’s academy in 2017 and made his Ligue 1 debut as a 16-year-old, becoming their second youngest ever player. He established himself as a regular in the 2023-24 season and, after just 46 league appearances,moved to Manchester United for £52.2m, making him one of the most expensive teenagers in history.After a season in which United finished eighth, with a negative goal difference for the first time since 1989-90, Yoro was stepping into a turbulent environment he was not expected to fix singlehandedly. He offered the team a calm centre-back who relied on intelligence, anticipation and clean defending rather than aggression: very much a long-term project rather than an instant solution.Yoro recently brought up a half-century of Manchester United appearances, becoming the youngest defender to reach that mark for the club since Phil Jones in 2013, and the long-term project remains very much alive. As is often the case with young centre-backs, he has shown flashes of potential alongside moments of vulnerability. That was evident at Aston Villa in December, when he was involved in both goals his team conceded, failing to apply sufficient pressure on Morgan Rogers for the opener and then unable to prevent him cutting inside on to his right foot for the second. Ruben Amorim later acknowledged Yoro’s tendency to dwell on errors, after he conceded a penalty at Crystal Palace in late November, admitting that “he makes a mistake and then he struggles.”Yoro has started just six of United’s past 17 matches so is not exactly integral to the team, but he is just 20. It remains to be seen whether he will live up to his price tag.Roméo Lavia: £54m, 19 years oldLavia was at the centre of a mini soap opera in the summer of 2023, when Chelsea andLiverpoollocked horns for the teenager’s signature. Chelsea ultimately emerged victorious, signing the Belgian from Southampton, but was he worth the fight?Lavia had established himself as one of Europe’s most promising young midfielders before joining Chelsea. In the 2022–23 season, he was one of only three teenage central midfielders in Europe’s top five leagues to make 60 or more tackles, alongside Eduardo Camavinga and Jude Bellingham, and he was among the Premier League’s top midfielders for winning possession. Press-resistant and mature beyond his years, Lavia offered both defensive solidarity and composure on the ball.Why Jérémy Jacquet may be the ‘heir to Virgil van Dijk’ for LiverpoolRead moreBut he has not had the chance to live up to his expectations. His time at Chelsea has been disrupted by injuries, with muscular problems limiting his first seasonto just 32 minutes of action. He made 22 appearances the following season but was sidelined five times with muscle injuries. This season has been no different. In nearly three years, Lavia has made 30 appearances for Chelsea but has not yet completed a full 90 minutes.“When he’s fit, he’s one of the best midfielders because he can defend very well, he can attack, he breaks the line, the pass between the lines, it is unbelievable,” Enzo Maresca said about Lavia. We are yet to fully see his full potential.Raheem Sterling: £55.4m, 20 years oldFrom a 16-year-old kid plucked from QPR’s academy to one third of the Premier League’s most feared attacking trident alongside Luis Suárez and Daniel Sturridge, Sterling’s rise at Liverpool was meteoric. He nearly won the Premier League with Liverpool but instead joined the club that kept pipping them to the title.Liverpool fans might not care to admit it but, if there is an example of money well spent on a young player, it is Sterling. With 131 goals and 94 assists in 339 appearances, he is one of the most influential attackers in the Pep Guardiola era. Only Sergio Agüero and Erling Haaland have outscored him among City’s modern greats. His goals weren’t just for show either; he collected four Premier League medals, an FA Cup and five League Cups.Yet, for all the output, Sterling’s importance at City began to quietly erode. Guardiola’s side evolved and so did Sterling’s role. The emergence of Phil Foden, the arrival of Jack Grealish and Guardiola’s increasing reluctance to use Sterling on his most effective flank saw him drift from automatic starter to rotational option.Chelsea moved quickly, making Sterling theirfirst signing under new ownershipin 2022. But what initially looked like a marquee signing quickly became a victim of constant managerial turnover and an overcrowded squad. Six managers later, his Chelsea career tells a far less flattering story. Wingers arrived by the dozen, systems changed by the month, and Sterling’s role shrank accordingly. Once the symbol of a new era, he found himself training away from the first team, grouped into the club’s so-called “bomb squad”, marginalised despite being one of the highest earners at £325,000 a week.Sterling is now a free agent, an extraordinary position for a player with 82 England caps, 13 major trophies and his career arc now also acts as a cautionary tale: not of early success but of how quickly narratives shift in football.View image in fullscreenRaheem Sterling is a great example of a young player who cost a lot and delivered.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesChristian Pulisic: £55.6m, 20 years oldPulisic arrived at Chelsea in 2019 carrying a burden few young players would handle: the expectation that he might fill the void left by Eden Hazard. The Belgian had delivered two Premier League titles, two Europa League trophies, an FA Cup, a League Cup and 110 goals, and his departure left not just a positional gap but a psychological one. Pulisic was never explicitly billed as Hazard’s replacement, but the timing and the fee ensured the comparison was inevitable.“I didn’t know anything about Pulisic yesterday,” said Maurizio Sarri after the signing. “The club asked my opinion about him about one month ago. My opinion was positive and today I knew the deal was done but I didn’t know anything.” That quote summed up Pulisic’s time at the club. Injuries constantly disrupted his rhythm and his confidence suffered under managers who either did not believe in his qualities or prioritised other players.Sarri, Frank Lampard, Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter all came and went but Pulisic struggled to find consistent playing time under any of them. In the end, he started just 58 of Chelsea’s 152 Premier League games over four seasons, seeing only 40.7% of the team’s available minutes and never truly establishing himself. He moved to Milan in 2023 for less than half what Chelsea paid to sign him.Rasmus Højlund: £67.7m, 20 years oldManchester United were once the best club in the country at nurturing youth talent. “If you’re good enough, you’re old enough,” is written on the walls of Carrington. Unfortunately for Højlund – a 20-year-old striker signed with barely a season of top-level experience – his time at Old Trafford did not follow the path carved out by the Busby Babes, Class of 92 and Cristiano Ronaldo.By Christmas of his debut season, he had gone 14 Premier League appearances without a goal,finally breaking the drought on Boxing Day. A run of seven goals in seven games followed, earning the accolade of becoming the youngest-ever player to score in six successive Premier League games.He ended the season with 16 goals in all competitions, the top scorer at the club that season – not bad for a young prospect – but expectations at United are unforgiving. Ten goals in all competitions the following season, including just four in the Premier League, brought scrutiny. What might be framed as a learning curve in a young talent’s career was instead considered a failure.Despite expressing a desire to stay, last summer Højlund was added to Amorim’s summer exiles alongside Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and André Onana. If you aren’t needed in a midweek League Cup tie away at Grimsby – and it’s the third game in succession you’ve been left out of the squad – the writing is on the wall. With United already out of the cup, no European football, andBenjamin Sesko now in the squad as the new £73.7m centre-forward, Højlund’s opportunities vanished fast. A move to Napoli offered a solid solution for all parties and confirmed a failed transfer for the talented youngster.This is an article byWhoScoredExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueGuardian Sport NetworkTransfer windowLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Each side has the same chance of being pitted against any other club and, for those few moments, there is a special feeling. Hope.Women’s FA Cup to have seeded teams and no draw after last 32 under radical proposalsRead moreYet even this most innocent of simple traditions is no longer safe from the claws of commercialisation.Proposals put forward by the Football Associationrevealed in the Guardian, include a controversial plan to seed the top-four Women’s Super League sides from the previous season so they avoid each other. This seeding would create a road-to-Wembley bracket from the round of 32 onwards, doing away with draw ceremonies for last 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals altogether.The FA’s justification is that it would help the competition generate move revenue from broadcasters and commercial partners and, to be fair, there is nothing wrong with the FA wanting to innovate to address a lack of income for this competition. However, giving a leg-up to the four wealthiest clubs is certainly not the right way.Only four clubs have managed to win the Women’s FA Cup in the past 13 years (you’ll never guess which four would be seeded if these rules were in place this season). The implication is that the organisers feel only semi-final showdowns between the big four make the final commercially viable, but do they not realise how insulting that is to every other club taking part?Instead, why not do a better job of telling those human stories that make the earlier rounds of the competition so special?Seeding four clubs would be a “temporary adjustment” but it is not clear for how long. The FA, in its summary document – seen by the Guardian – appears to contradict itself. At first it says: “This proposal creates the highest chances of consistent high-quality matches throughout the later rounds of the competition.” But then later in the same paragraph, claims if would offer “a chance of a variation of fixtures”.View image in fullscreenManchester United supporters before the Women’s FA Cup final at Wembley.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAEqually, let us not pretend everything is rosy with the current situation. Having covered the competition since 2015, reporting on more than 50 ties, this reporter has never witnessed a giant-killing.There have been occasional upsets, but they are scarce. Since the WSL was founded in 2011, no top-flight side has been knocked out by a club from below the second tier, and even instances of WSL2 sides eliminating top-tier clubs are rare. Second-tier Birmingham’s 1-0 win at Everton in January 2023 was the last time that happened, and is one of only two since 2019.Mismatches, such as WSL2 leaders Charlton’s 10-0 victory over fourth-tier Swindon in this season’s fourth round, are not uncommon. Last year, Aston Villa thrashed Bristol Rovers 9-0, such is the chasm in resources between elite clubs and part-time or amateur sides in women’s football.The solution to that, though, is surely to filter more money and support down the pyramid to help lift the lower tiers rather than to boost the top four by further enhancing their chances of winning the £430,000 prize, a cash injection that is not needed by Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City or Manchester United but could do wonders for local community facilities.Overwhelmingly, fans’ reaction has been one of anger and bafflement. Of the 51 X users who had replied to this writer’s post about the proposed changes between Tuesday morning and Thursday morning, 50 were negative. In a powerful statement of opposition, the Manchester City Official Women’s Supporters Club “vehemently oppose these ideas”.“We feel it goes against the very ethos of what the FA Cup represents. The whole idea of being able to draw anyone, home or away, throughout the entire competition, gives it a unique magic that supporters of all clubs appreciate and embrace. Seeding the top four clubs would remove that magic and we feel strongly that it should not happen.”A spokesperson for the Football Supporters’ Association said: “The FSA is taking part in ongoing discussions with the FA as part of their review of the competition, during which fan representatives have expressed concern about proposals around seeding – something which fans feel goes against the traditions of the FA Cup.”Outlining its position, an FA spokesperson responded: “We committed in our women’s and girls’ game strategy, Reaching Higher, to review the Adobe Women’s FA Cup, recognising the need to evolve the competition and strengthen its commercial potential. This would enable us to reinvest more funding into both the competition itself and the wider women’s football ecosystem, which is vital for long-term, sustainable growth.“While a comprehensive review of the current format has been completed, no decisions have been made at this stage. Any future changes will be shaped in close consultation with stakeholders across the entire pyramid, including clubs, players, fans, and our broadcast and commercial partners.”The manager of Hull City Ladies, Chris Hames, whose third-tier side reached the fourth round, said: “I’m concerned by the direction they are trying to take the wider game, this being just another example of how there [are] only five or six clubs truly cared about in the women’s pyramid.”View image in fullscreenIpswich Town and Sheffield United players walk out on to the pitch for their fourth-round match in January, won 2-1 by the Blades.Photograph: Stephen Pond/The FA/Getty ImagesThere are other areas of concern within the FA’s proposals too, not least an “entry tier review” about which, in a leaked document, the organisers say: “We recognise the impact that this change would have on clubs playing in tier 7.”Additionally, bunching the latter rounds closer together in the calendar could have wider implications on league fixtures and sources at two WSL clubs have already raised concerns about potentially not being able to stage their derby fixture in its usual window during the men’s March international break.It is important to emphasise that no final decisions have yet been made – a period of consultation is taking place, before a final plan will be put to the FA board in April, so there is still time for stakeholders’ feedback to matter.The FA review’s wide-ranging scope, which has preceded these conversations, should be applauded for its breadth, and it does include some better conclusions, not least that the final should remain at Wembley.

Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!Barry GlendenningThu 5 Feb 2026 11.46 ESTFirst published on Thu 5 Feb 2026 11.02 ESTShareRETURN OF THE MARC?In any other season, Antoine Semenyo would not have been allowed to feature for Manchester City in the semi-final of Fizzy Cup due to being “cup-tied” after playing for Bournemouth in their August defeat to Brentford. Luckily for Semenyo, a change to the rules meant that Manchester City’s shiny new £65m winger is allowed to have a second crack at Fizzy Cup, because he was signed before the first leg of the semi-final, in which he played a starring role to helpobliterate holders Newcastle United(a first leg in which Max Alleyne also excelled for City, despite having already represented Watford in the competition earlier this season). Having seen his team clearly benefit from this revolutionary tweak of Fizzy Cup rule 6.4.2, you’d expect Pep Guardiola to be delighted, eh?Oh.In the aftermath of last night’s weird second leg in which Newcastle had their collective backside handed to them despite creating and missing enough chances to win several matches, Pep decided to ignore the conspicuous upsides of the new rule regarding eligibility and focus instead on what he saw as their inexplicably baffling downside. Specifically the one that states a player can only represent two clubs in Fizzy Cup if he joins the second onebeforea ball has been kicked in the semi-final. Sadly for Pep, it means his other January acquisition, Marc Guéhi, is now ineligible to play in the final because he didn’t arrive at the Etihad untilafterCity had conquered St James’ Park.“Antoine arrived before the first [leg] so could play,” said Pep. “And now it’s the final. Why should he [Guéhi] not play? Why not? We pay his salary, he is our player. I said to the club, they have to ask, definitely. I don’t understand the reason why he cannot play in the final in March, when I have been here for a long time. The rules to buy a player depends on Fifa, Uefa, the Premier League who say, OK the transfer window is open, when you buy a player you have to play, no? It’s logic. Of course we are going to try to ask [for] him to play. Pure logic.” While Football Daily would never be so bold as to accuse any manager of being even remotely self-serving, we can’t help but feel that Pep’s irritation at having to follow a competition’s clearly signposted rules might have something to do with the defensive injury crisis in which his team currently find themselves, which in turn prompted the acquisition of Guéhi in the first place.The EFL have let it be known that any appeal to clear Guéhi to play in the final will be firmly rebuffed but given their penchant for pushing the envelope, City may risk picking him anyway safe in the knowledge that any subsequent investigation into their conduct will take aeons to complete. The good news for Pep is that another rule change means Guéhi will be allowed to represent his new team in the FA Cup, subject to him having cleansed himself of the stink ofCrystal Palace’s defeat against Macclesfieldlast time out.QUOTE OF THE DAY“James Milner is a role model, still playing on the level he plays and also training on the level he trains. I think that will be a special thing for him but he is focused on the ambitions from the club as well. He wants to be always successful, like he was his whole life” – Brighton manager Fabian Hürzeler, who was nine years old when Milner made his top-flight debut in 2002, prepares to hand the veteran midfielder his record-equalling 653rd Premier League appearance.View image in fullscreenRespect your elders: Fabian Hürzeler greets James Milner after Brighton’s win over Burnley last month.Photograph: Simon Dael/ShutterstockFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS“Football Daily is correct in claiming that us Arsenal fans are really not counting any chickens regarding the quadruple.

It is going to take a seriously good team to beat France in Paris in this year’s championship and ­watching them attack will be an ­absolute treat. Ireland were not so much beaten as outplayed by ­opponents who will be even more dangerous with a dry ball at their disposal.Never mind the argument about brief in-game adverts during ITV’s coverage. Irish fans would probably have preferred a total 80-minute blackout or, failing that, an entire evening of cookery programming. Instead those back at home had to watch the visitors being repeatedly sliced and diced by seemingly ravenous hosts. Talk about eating your greens.France v Ireland: Six Nations 2026 opener – liveRead moreHad it been a drier evening it really could have been messy. As it was the ­spectacularly good Louis Bielle-­Biarrey still helped himself to two sparkling tries and France’s close-quarters passing, kicking game and creative elan were sometimes ­sublime. Ireland arrived with a raft of injuries but, despite a second-half rally, they can now add bruised pride to the list. Their head coach, Andy Farrell, was certainly not looking for excuses afterwards.“You make your own luck in this game and you make your own luck by being ahead of the game in most things that are probably without the ball,” he said. “We certainly lost that battle in the first half. Things like the high balls and winning the scraps on the floor, and running through tackles and ourselves missing tackles, that’s the main part of the game, isn’t it?“We certainly came off second best in that regard in the first half. Our response to that in the second half – and a gallant response – [was good] but it’s not what we want to be, a responding team. We need to show up from the get-go.”France’s performance will also be food for thought for the rest of the field.While the Six Nations holders were without one or two key forwards themselves, you would never have guessed it.Les Bleusare not yet the finished ­article and eased off slightly with the match already won but their promise is unmistakable. Ireland, for their part, were made to look poor for the opening 40 minutes and will be grateful to their bench for bringing a little more second-half energy in this experimental slot for a Six Nations opening fixture.And maybe there is a longer-term future for big-time Thursday night rugby. The light show inside the Stade de France made it feel like a Friday night in everything but name and the Marseillaise was sung with just as much gusto. When they want to put on a show in Paris there are few places quite as dazzling.It was also great to see Antoine Dupont back on Six Nations duty for the first time since wrecking his cruciate ligamentagainst Ireland in Dublinlast year. Like everyone else, though, he was required to deal with ­conditions that were testing in the extreme. A sodden pitch and slippery ball can make life awkward even for the very best playmakers.View image in fullscreenMatthieu Jalibert scores France’s second try despite the efforts of Ireland’s Cian Prendergast.Photograph: INPHO/ShutterstockFrance, though, came close to ­conjuring something miraculous in the opening minutes. A rapid attack down the left was somehow kept alive by Bielle-Biarrey who showed ­exceptional footballing ­ability to ­dribble his side within range of the Irish line. The ball eventually rebounded forward off Charles Ollivon but it was an early sign of the threat this young French side can offer.Ireland had been suitably warned. With only 12 minutes on the clock the hosts had their first try and what a cracker it was. For a moment ­Ireland seemed to have cleared the danger when Sam Prendergast hacked a ball up the touchline like a lower league right-back clearing his lines. France, though, managed to keep it alive and found the lurking Bielle-­Biarrey, who slid out of a tap tackle by ­Prendergast and rounded the last man to add ­further gloss to his already ­shimmering reputation.Ireland’s only option was to dig deep and battle like mad for everything. Even that strategy was barely enough as France poured forward again, denied a second try only when Nicolas Depoortère’s final pass with the line begging ended up in Prendergast’s hands rather than either of the two blue-shirted players outside him.Again it was only a temporary reprieve as France neatly exploited the territorial platform to work the alert Matthieu Jalibert over. The mass rush to congratulate the Bordeaux fly-half said a lot about how the rest of his team see their No 10, regardless of his previously tepid relationship with the head coach, Fabien Galthié.There was also no hiding the ­ability and impact of the young French lock Mickaël Guillard, another with a big international future ahead of him. Time and again he came looking for work, forcing Ireland to soak up a worrying number of early tackles. The 25-year-old Lyon forward can play, too, surging into the line to maintain yet another French counterattack before throwing a deft inside scoring pass to the busy Ollivon,View image in fullscreenNick Timoney scores Ireland’s first try to belatedly put the visitors on the scoresheet.Photograph: Brendan Moran/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesWith Thomas Ramos kicking well it made it 22-0 at the interval with ­Ireland barely in the frame. Apart from one brief moment when ­Prendergast and Ramos were in a shoulder-to-shoulder sprint for a loose ball close to the French line there was barely a moment to make an Irish heart flutter with optimism. Even then it would not have counted, with the referee, Karl Dickson, ruling Prendergast had unfairly impeded his opponent.France did not even concede a single first-half penalty and their fourth try was another collector’s item, Ramos side-footing the ball to Bielle-Biarrey after Dupont’s little chip over the top. Ireland did finally save some face just before the hour mark when Nick Timoney crashed over and, shortly afterwards, his fellow replacement Michael Milne grabbed a second. It massaged the scoreboard pain slightly but did little to alter the wider narrative, a truth further underlined by Théo Attissogbe’s late score in the right corner.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026France rugby union teamIreland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

After scoring 73.25 on his first run and 71.50 on his second, Guseli knew he needed something special to qualify into the final on Sunday (0530 AEDT).JD Vance’s first Olympic appearance unfolds with more photo-ops than protestsRead moreWith competitors in big air launching off a ramp built on scaffolding that rises more than 50 metres above the course, Guseli soared and spun before nailing his landing. He threw his snowboard into the air in delight at securing the equal second-best score of the day, with a combined total of 163.0.Hiroto Ogiwara led a three-man Japanese attack in the field with a top score of 178.5 points, while three New Zealanders – Lyon Farrell, Rocco Jamieson and Dane Menzies – also made the cut.Ogiwara smashed the record books for snowboarding at the 2025 Aspen X Games when he landed the first 2340-degree jump (six-and-a-half rotations) in competition. Home favourite Ian Matteoli was second in qualifying with 174.5 points, giving the Italian fans a reason to cheer.View image in fullscreenAustralia snowboarder Valentino Guseli flies through the air on his third run.Photograph: Marko Đurica/ReutersGuseli was given the surprise honour of being the first Australian to compete at the Milan-Cortina Olympics after being granted a start into the event on the day of competition.He had ambitions of competing in three events in Italy – big air, slopestyle and halfpipe – but failed to qualify for the first two after injuring his ACL in late 2024.Guseli is still considered a strong medal chance in the halfpipe after winning a World Cup event in Calgary and placing sixth at the Beijing Olympics, where he made his debut.Australia’s Torah Bright became the first person to compete in three snowboard disciplines at a single Olympics when she lined up at Sochi in 2014 in the halfpipe, slopestyle and snowboard cross, winning silver in the halfpipe.As first reserve, Guseli got the nod for the big air following the withdrawal of Canadian Mark McMorris due to injury. Qualification for big air and slopestyle are linked but Guseli isn’t guaranteed a start in slopestyle with McMorris given the opportunity to recover and compete.The Canadian veteran was carried off on stretcher after he crashed during training in Livigno, with competitors in big air launching off a ramp built on scaffolding that rises more than 50 metres above the course.Explore more on these topicsWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2026Australia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Which makes the prediction of Eve Muirhead, Britain’s chef de mission at the Milano Cortina Games, rather extraordinary.“I believe that we are taking one of the most potent teams of athletes that we have taken to a Winter Olympic Games,” she says. “We have the capability to disrupt the norm.”‘Penis injection’ claims in Winter Olympics ski jumping investigated by WadaRead moreThat norm, between 1952 and 2010, was just 12 medals in 16 Winter Games. Then came a surge, withfive medals in Sochi in 2014and five inPyeongchang in 2018, beforeBritain won just two medals in Beijing. But Muirhead, who led thewomen’s curling team to Team GB’s only goldfour years ago, senses that new ground will be broken by the 53 British athletes over the next 16 days.“I see a set of athletes with a real pedigree in terms of recent results in the winter circuit,” she says. “And while we are a nation that already punches well above our weight, given the relative lack of snow and ice, I believe this team has the potential to really disrupt the natural order of big winter nations.”UK Sport, which has invested £25.5m across winter sports for the 2022-26 cycle, has set a goal of four to eight medals. But it is clear that Muirhead wants to be right at the top end of that target.“As a nation we are still an emerging challenger in many winter sports and part of our ambition at the Games is to show we are a credible team across all disciplines,” she adds. “And I firmly believe we will be.”There is certainly significant evidence behind her optimism. In the weeks before the Games, GB Snowsports’Mia Brookes, Kirsty Muir andZoe Atkinall won X Games titles, while Charlotte Bankes won her first World Cup race since breaking her collar bone.View image in fullscreenNow chef de mission for Team GB, Eve Muirhead is hoping several of Britain’s competitors can emulate her gold medal at the 2022 Winter Olympics.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAIn the men’s skeleton,Matt Weston and Marcus Wyatthave won all seven World Cup races this season and, according to the bookies, the men’s and mixed curling teams are also favourites to win a medal.It helps that additional resources have also been pumped into technological innovations. At the University of Bath a flight simulator has been converted to simulate any skeleton track across the world, allowing the team to get hours of extra practice on the run they will encounter in Cortina.Weston and Wyatt are also waiting to see whether they will be able to usetheir new aerodynamic helmets, which could give them an even bigger advantage. “We try to push the boundaries and find those gains, this is just one of the parts of innovation we do as GB and I think we do it pretty well,” says Weston.Wyatt, meanwhile, is hopeful the helmet will be cleared. “We believe it is legal, it’s currently being debated. All of our success has been with our current helmet, so for me it is the tiniest little thing in the background.”Meanwhile, in sports where speed is the major factor, special tech skinsuits have been introduced to reduce drag in competition, allowing athletes to go faster.The great unknown, of course, is what other nations have planned. “We know that in some of those sports, particularly the sliding sports, the Germans run an R&I programme which is worth millions,” says UK Sport’s head of performance, Kate Baker. “They could pull something out on the day.“I think if you spend any time hanging around any of our sports, not just the winter sports, you will see that they are all constantly looking at what everybody else is doing. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that it’s an arms race. It is definitely an expertise race, though.“Where other nations have a sliding track, or a ski slope on their doorstep, they are able to do the kind of behind-closed-doors stuff that we can do more easily in cycling than we can in winter sports.”But for all the emphasis on tech and talent, those competing know their chances could come down to a lucky break or how they handle the pressure.“None of us really want to make the Olympics a big thing, but it is in reality and there’s no hiding that,” says Brookes, the 19-year-old who could end up winning two medals and being Britain’s biggest star at these Games.“I’ve been scared that I’ll go to the Olympics, do the best I can, and it not be enough. You know the whole world’s going to be watching, and that definitely adds more pressure.”Muirhead agrees. “A lot of these athletes have 20-30 seconds of competition. Then there’s the jeopardy of winter sports. A wrong edge, that could be it over. It comes down to millimetres, milliseconds. But let’s just kind of hope we’re on the right side of the inch.”Team GB will hope to get off to a strong start on Monday with Muir and Brookes going for gold in the ski slopestyle and snowboard big air respectively, while the mixed curling team will aim to be competing in the semi-finals.Whatever happens, Muirhead expects the nation to quickly renew its once-every-four-year fling with winter sports. “What does the Winter Olympics not have?” she asks. “You’ve got speed, flair and I guess a bit of chaos thrown in as well. And that’s what people love to watch on TV.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBnewsShareReuse this content"

A more radical option would be to move Freddie Steward to the wing and select Marcus Smith, who has been named on the bench, at full-back. Cadan Murley of Harlequins was also named in the squad, but is due to appear for England A against Ireland on Friday night.Six Nations 2026 predictions: our writers on who will win and whyRead moreLosing Feyi-Waboso would be a blow given his form for England and Exeter this season. He started all four of England’s autumn internationals, scoring two tries, and was a constant threat on the wing, reintroducing himself to the international stage after missing last year’s Six Nations with a shoulder injury.For Feyi-Waboso it would be a desperate shame given he is yet to appear for England against Wales, having had the opportunity to choose which of the two nations he would represent. “He’s really keen to be as good as he can be,” said the defence coach Richard Wigglesworth, who confirmed the 23-year-old is a fitness concern. “He’s really coachable, takes feedback really well, wants to learn and he’s got incredible physical commitment as well.”Jamie George, meanwhile, has said that he did not expect to captain England again after he was restored to the role for Saturday’s match with Maro Itoje named on the bench. Itojemissed the start of England’s training campin Girona after travelling to Nigeria to attend his mother’s funeral.As a result Borthwick will start Itoje on the bench, with George leading the side on his own for the first time since his Saracens clubmate was appointed captain last January, before the 2025 championship.“It’s a privilege, I love this job, it’s the best thing in the world, being able to do this,” said George, who co-captained the side with George Ford on last summer’s tour of the Americas. “It’s an incredible opportunity to be doing it again. It’s probably for one week and one week only, so I’m making the most of it. Not a huge amount has changed, the leadership meetings that we have – myself, George, Ellis, Maro – we’re having conversations, I’m speaking to Maro constantly.”England, after 11 straight victories, are red-hot favourites to beat a Wales side who have not won a Six Nations match since 2023. With some bookmakers England are 66-1 on to put Wales to the sword and, while George believes that gives England’s opponents a “free hit”, the 35-year-old hooker has called on his side to embrace the expectation.“While we are looking to use the momentum of the last 12 months we’ve made it very clear that we need to start big and start fast and set the markers down about what this team is going to be moving forward,” he added. “We haven’t shied away from it.“It’s a free swing [for Wales]. When you’re a leader of a team you go looking for what’s going to drive us and I’ve no doubt they’ll be using all the stuff that’s going on in the background, the fact that it’s England v Wales, if I was in their camp I’d probably be saying the same thing.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSix Nations 2026Six NationsRugby unionWales rugby union teamnewsShareReuse this content"

He said when he contacted Facewatch, he was told to send in a picture of himself and a photograph of his passport before the firm confirmed it had no record of him on its database.“One of the reasons I was angry was because I shouldn’t have to prove I am innocent,” Rajah said. “I shouldn’t have to prove I’m wrongly identified as a criminal.” He described the incident as feeling “quite like Minority Report, Orwellian”.He said while doing his normal shop, he was approached by three members of the store’s staff, one of whom appeared to affirm that he was the person pictured on a device they had. It is understood the Facewatch system flagged someone else who had entered the store, and staff mistook Rajah for him.Rajah was concerned some form of permanent record implying he had been involved in criminality might have been created on Facewatch’s system. Eventually, the firm told him he was not on its database and referred him back to Sainsbury’s.“You felt quite helpless in the situation because you’re just thrown from pillar to post – because Sainsbury’s initially blame Facewatch, then Facewatch retort saying it’s actually Sainsbury’s,” he said. “And then, when Sainsbury’s called me on Wednesday from the executive office, they blamed the store staff. So they’re constantly shifting the blame as to who’s responsible for this.”Rajah was upset that he felt he had had to prove his innocence – and said he had received little assurance about how the information he had to hand over to Facewatch was stored, and whether it had been deleted.And he said that, while he was lucky enough to be able to navigate the system, “what happens to the vulnerable people who, for example, have learning disabilities or don’t know how to scan a QR code? They haven’t put any processes or procedures in place for anybody to challenge this. You should not be expected to send your personal information – that is totally unacceptable.”Sainsbury’s said: “We have been in contact with Mr Rajah to sincerely apologise for his experience in our Elephant and Castle store. This was not an issue with the facial recognition technology in use but a case of the wrong person being approached in store.”Facewatch said: “We’re sorry to hear about Mr Rajah’s experience and understand why it would have been upsetting. This incident arose from a case of human error in store, where a member of staff approached the wrong customer.“Our data protection team followed the usual process to confirm his identity and verified that he was not on our database and had not been subject to any alerts generated by Facewatch.”Explore more on these topicsFacial recognitionData protectionLondonSurveillanceJ SainsburyEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Any investment would depend on the mine supplying tin to the US, which considers the metal to be a critical mineral.Tin is used for soldering and is found in most electronic devices, as well as electric cars and solar panels. The metal is important for connecting semiconductor chips to circuit boards and its value has surged amid the boom in investment in datacentres that will power the AI industry.The metal’s price has risen sharply over the last decade, from $16,000 a tonne in 2016 to more than $50,000 at the start of this year.However, about two-thirds of the tin mined today comes from China, Myanmar and Indonesia, where there arelong-running concernsabout fragile supply chains and the use of child labour.Don Turvey, the chief executive of Cornish Metals, said the US interest was “a testament to the quality and strategic importance of South Crofty and its potential to become the first new tin producer in the western world”.Shares in Cornish Metals jumped nearly 7% on Thursday.South Croftyreceived a £28.6m investmentfrom the UK government in 2025 to support efforts to reopen it. Last summer, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, estimated the mine the could support 1,300 jobs in the wider region.Separately, a US-led critical minerals summit on Wednesday involving 50 countries produced a slew of agreements aimed at loosening China’s grip on more than 25 key elements, in their raw form and processed.The EU and the US announced joint intentions to work closer together, committing to a memorandum of understanding in the next 30 days. The two will also work with Japan on building additional supplies, after a separate US-Japan arrangement signed in October.The US state department said it had signed 11 bilateral deals on critical minerals at the summit, convened by the state secretary, Marco Rubio.Patrick Schröder, a senior research fellow at Chatham House’s Environment and Society Centre, said speeches by Rubio and the US vice-president, JD Vance, had made it clear the driving interest was that the US wanted to secure supplies for AI development.“Although they didn’t say it explicitly, it is still America first. It was framed as ‘America needs your help’. There was no mention of renewables,” Schröder said.Explore more on these topicsMiningCornwallUS foreign policyTrump administrationCommoditiesTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

Last week it was reported that a much-discussed $100bn deal –announced last September– between Nvidia and OpenAI might not be happening at all.This was a circular arrangement through which the chipmaker would supply the ChatGPT developer with huge sums of money that would largely go towards the purchase of its own chips.It is this type of deal that has alarmed some market watchers, whodetect a whiff of the 1999-2000 dotcom bubblein these transactions.Now it seems that Nvidia was not as solid on this investment as had been widely believed, according to the Wall Street Journal. Negotiations had not progressed, with Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, privately emphasising that the deal was “non-binding” and “not finalised”. Huang appeared to confirm this in Taipei on Saturday, telling reporters that Nvidia would make a “huge” investment into OpenAI’s next funding round, but “nothing like” $100bn.A report from Reuters soon suggested that the feeling was mutual: OpenAI was “unsatisfied” with Nvidia’s advanced AI chips, it said, and seeking alternatives. Nvidia’s stock has taken a 10% hit so far this week, a flurry of headlines have ensued and both companies have stepped into damage control.“We love working with Nvidia and they make the best AI chips in the world,”wroteSam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, on X. “We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time.”Even Oracle appears to be shaken: the software company, which is counting on a $300bn cloud computingdealwith OpenAI,saidit still expects the startup to be good for its commitment even if it does not receive the full amount from Nvidia. In total, OpenAI has committed to compute deals – the infrastructure for building and powering its AI tools – worthmore than$1tn.View image in fullscreenOpenAI’s ChatGPT is losing ground to competitors.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPA“The Nvidia-OpenAI deal has zero impact on our financial relationship with OpenAI,”Oracleposted on X. “We remain highly confident in OpenAI’s ability to raise funds and meet its commitments.”That a $100bn deal between two of the most crucial players in AI appears to have evaporated over a weekend is unsettling. But there are solid business reasons behind the apparent shake-up, said Alvin Nguyen, analyst at research firm Forrester.OpenAI’s ambitious growth trajectory means it will be difficult for the company to stick with a single vendor, especially as it plans new, computationally demanding AI models, he said. “They need chips. They need as many as possible.”As for Nvidia, its commitment to the $100bn may have been loose in the first place, even as it was widely reported. “They will not discourage people from overhyping. Why say something and immediately sucker punch your own share price?”For a giant startup like OpenAI, manoeuvring in and out of deals – for example, with chipmakers – may just be business as usual, said Nguyen: “You know [Altman’s] background as a startup person, and you know the manoeuvres he’s doing make sense from a startup perspective.”For Nvidia, meanwhile, AI hype is part of selling chips. “You don’t know what’s going to happen,” said Nguyen. “And so you let other people put numbers out there for you and let that drive the hype.”The issue is, of course, that investors and other companies like Oracle may have taken widely reported $100bn commitments seriously.In response to a query from the Guardian, an OpenAI spokesperson referred to Altman’s X post, and to remarks Huang made to CNBC on Tuesday, including: “There is no drama.”The spokesperson added: “Our teams are actively working through details of our partnership. Nvidia technology has underpinned our breakthroughs from the start, powers our systems today, and will remain central as we scale what comes next.”Nvidia and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.This is all taking place against the backdrop of a changing investment landscape for AI, where hype is giving way to realities about what aspects of the technology are actually going to earn money.While investors ponder whether OpenAI is going to be able to pay for a $1.4tn compute deal, reality is biting further down the AI food chain. This week has seen a massive sell-off in certain softwarestocks, prompted in part by the launch of a new Anthropic AI tool that can carry out a number of professional services, which has led to fears that business models exposed to competition from AI products will be disrupted .This is the flip-side of “jagged AI”, which is the term for advanced AI tools having uneven talents, such as being good at sifting through documents but less good at solving complex maths problems. If advanced systems are good at automating legal work, then legacy companies in service industries will suffer. The losers are beginning to emerge and are being picked up by investors.At the top of the AI pyramid the competitive effects are also biting. OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, is losing ground to competitors. Data releasedon Tuesdayshow its market share has eroded from 69% to 45% owing to the rise of Google’s Gemini, xAI’s Grok and Anthropic’s Claude. OpenAI appears to have retreated from soaring talk of super-intelligence in the past months, focusing instead on profitable mundanities such as adverts and adult content.The apparent evaporation of a $100bn deal may be of a piece with last year’s sci-fi rhetoric meeting this year’s practicalities. The question is, who might be left holding the bill?“I think there will be knock-on effects,” said Nguyen. “I mean, it’s that statement: the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)NvidiaOpenAIOracleComputinganalysisShareReuse this content"

Ryan, who hadworkedfor seven years at the Ethereum Foundation (EF), Ethereum’s de facto governing body, suggested that Ethereum could be on the cusp of an era-defining shift.Since its founding in 2014, the foundation had prioritized technical upgrades and had avoided centralizing power while its user base was growing, but Ethereum had now grown up, and the cryptocurrency world around it had grown up, too. The EF could now “exercise a stronger voice” without compromising its ethos of decentralization, Ryan said – and he was open to leading that charge if appointed as the foundation’s new executive director.Ryan told the Guardian that he could see how political tides were changing “overnight”, which informed his proposal. In part, his thesis drew from personal experience: He’d been served by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2024, only to have the case summarily dropped, which he suspects was a pragmatic move to avoid alienating the tech sector during Joe Biden’s re-election campaign. By November, with Donald Trump poised to return to the White House as the self-appointed “crypto president”, Ryan could identify “a massive American-shaped opportunity”.SEC drops lawsuit against Winklevoss twins’ crypto firmRead moreTrump’s re-election washeavily bankrolledby crypto companies and advocacy groups; the sector had establishedlucrative tiesto the Trump family, and expected a slate ofpolicy changesin its favor. A second Trump administration was likely to bolster the crypto industry’s ability to expand into the traditional financial sector, and vice versa, further buoying up Ethereum’s prospects. These new political and economic realities meant a “stronger voice” from the EF that could mean a windfall for Ethereum – a logic that helped catalyze a high-profile leadership shakeup within the Ethereum ecosystem, and, once the dust settled, anointed new leaders tasked with wooing Wall Street.Despite strong winds at the industry’s back, the value of Ethereum’s proprietary cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), is down 20% from one year ago, part of awidespread slump in crypto’s value. The price has remained almost unchanged since November 2024, when Ryan made his pitch, which is the same as it was in 2022, an asset at risk of depreciating in a world of high risk.ETH’s dual, dueling factionsThe Ethereum blockchain is a hub for hundreds of billions of dollars of financial products. Ether is the world’s second largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization hovering around $400bn. Founded in 2013 by programmer Buterin, ether is also the largest cryptocurrency to have a known leader. The identity of the founder ofBitcoin, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, is not publicly known. Following Ethereum’s launch, Buterin and others established the EF as a non-profit tasked with cultivating the Ethereum ecosystem – a centralized, neutral entity designed to grow a decentralized technological movement – and writing grants to ecosystem participants in line with that mission; the EF holds more than $600m worth of ETH in treasury. Buterin sits on the EF’s board.“In crypto in general, there are two sides of the space: there’s what they call the computer, and what they call the casino,” said Timour Kosters, the founder ofEdge City, a series of pop-up residency programs affiliated with Ethereum. The “computer” side looks to tackle systemic issues by building tech solutions, Kosters explained; the “casino” side leans into finance, including some scams. The two most prominent ideological camps within Ethereum follow this rule of thumb. On one end is Ethereum’s traditional and more libertarian ideological base, the “Cypherpunks”, who see privacy, decentralized protocols and freedom from state power as tools for individual freedom. On the other end, according to Paul Dylan-Ennis, a scholar who studies Ethereum’s subcultures, is a more “pragmatist” and “populist” cadre motivated by the price of ETH and seeking to expand institutional adoption of Ethereum and ETH.Ryan recalled the discussions with Buterin of his proposed strategic plan for the EF as being “positive”, and said the dialogue expanded to include other leaders within the foundation. That included Aya Miyaguchi, the organization’s longtime executive director and astewardof Ethereum’s traditional ideological core. But then news of these discussions was leaked to the public – opening the floodgates on social media.On X, some Ethereum users clamored for Ryan’s appointment, and lobbied for Miyaguchi’s ouster. Eric Conner, a veteran Ethereum developer,suggested“it’s revolt time” if the foundation failed to appoint Ryan as its new executive director. Some social media usersposteddeath threats against Miyaguchi, which incensed Buterin.ETH holders pressure their leadersSome Ethereum community members had been calling for leadership change at the EF over the course of 2024 – long before Ryan’s strategic meetings with EF leadership. Many pragmatists thought the foundation was not proactive enough in growing Ethereum’s adoption, including among financial institutions. Others blamed Miyaguchi for Ether’s relatively static price, as ETH had not skyrocketed in value the way bitcoin and other coins had with Trump’s rise.Paul Brody, who leads blockchain initiatives at Ernst & Young and is the chairman of theEnterprise Ethereum Alliance, a coalition of large businesses adopting Ethereum-based technology, said that, while critiques against Miyaguchi were “tinged with misogyny”, calling for a leadership change because of Ethereum’s static price resembles standard investor discontents.“In some ways, the Ethereum community is behaving a lot like pretty normal shareholders … They want a return on their investment,” he said.In January 2025, Buterin responded to this community pressure, framing the threats levied against Miyaguchi as “pure evil”. He added that the complaints were “decreasing the chance I have any interest whatsoever in doing ‘what you want’”.“The person deciding the new EF leadership team is me,” hetweeted.A former member of the EF, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal foundation matters, said Buterin’s social media post was a “turning point” and “uncharacteristic”, as the founder typically “pretended that [Ethereum] was in the hands of the community”. The former EF employee told the Guardian that EF management organized a foundation-wide retreat “in order to force” Buterin into naming a new executive director quickly, as Buterin “couldn’t really make up his mind”, and Miyaguchi had wanted to step back “for a while”. The source added that, in personal conversation, Buterin dismissed Ryan’s backers as a small but vocal American subset of the global Ethereum ecosystem. By the end, “the old management” was “almost universally hated” by the EF’s employees, they said.Another former EF employee, likewise speaking on the condition of anonymity, similarly noted that Buterin’s tweets were a departure from his typical “cosplaying” that he didn’t control Ethereum. Buterin and Miyaguchi have a close relationship, the former employee alleged, which informed Buterin’s reluctance to find Miyaguchi’s replacement more expediently, the source hypothesized.They claimed Buterin “isn’t over” the rejection of his work visa by US authorities in 2012 and remains “resolutely” against EF staff talking to US politicians. The former employee suspected this disfavor counted against Ryan, an American. Buterin only finalized a leadership change once he realized the extent of dissatisfaction within the EF, not just online, the employee concluded.Change is in the air, finallyOn 1 March 1, the EFannouncedthe appointment of two co-executive directors: one from each strand of Ethereum’s culture, according to Dylan-Ennis, the Ethereum scholar: Tomasz Stańczak, a former vice-president at Citi, and Hsiao-Wei Wang, a veteran Ethereum-focused engineer.The EF’s new leaders were brought on specifically with a “mandate of being more open, communicating more, and [being] responsible to the business world”, which is home to “builders focused on real-world use cases”, Stańczak told the Guardian in November. “Compared to previous years, there is probably much more green light for institutions to adopt Ethereum,” he added. The EF now operatesa landing pagedesigned for institutions interested in understanding and potentially adopting Ethereum technology.Two former EF employees said these basic changes highlight the extent to which the foundation had previously adopted a “defensive posture” and had “worried about the SEC”, using opacity and plausible deniability to avoid legal action. To that end, the EF only published a public-facing organizational chart over the summer, partly anonymizing its employees prior to that shift. The foundation’s growth and clear hierarchy also depart from its longstanding decentralized ethos; during her time as executive director, Miyaguchi hadcalled forthe EF to “subtract” in size and power over time.“The surprising twist in recent times is now the EF is seen as very much directing ‘Ethereum the protocol’ and, to some extent, ‘Ethereum the culture’,” Dylan-Ennis said. “In this sense, [the foundation] has become more important than ever. It is too early to say whether this is for the better or the worse.”‘American-shaped opportunity’Ryan emphasized in an interview that he has “the utmost respect for Aya Miyaguchi”. The public leak of their discussions around the EF’s future led to “a lot of toxicity” that “threw off” their dialogue, he added. Buterin and Ryan decided to amicably “close the door” on their discussions by January 2025. Ryan said this was not solely because of the online campaign, but also due to differences in opinion about the Ethereum Foundation’s next steps – including the “American-shaped opportunity” lying beyond the EF’s interests.Connected to other Wall Street-facing Ethereum evangelists by senior EF leadership, Ryan announced in February 2025 that he was co-foundingEtherealize, an EF-aligned organization building and marketing Ethereum-based products for traditional financial institutions. Etherealize frequently exercises a strong voice for Ethereum as it does the rounds on Capitol Hill and Wall Street.Vivek Raman, a co-founder ofEtherealize, said Ethereum-focused sales cycles with large financial institutions once spanned years and involved frequent rejection, but are now accelerating, a sign Wall Street is warming to cryptocurrency. Major firms like JP Morgan, Fidelity and BlackRock are seeking to offer financial products issued on blockchains, in a process called “tokenization”, he said, predicting that a wave of these products will enter the market in 2026 after December 2025 launches.However, ether, like other major cryptocurrencies, is still crawling back from a sudden drop in value.“The price of crypto has fallen like 40% in the last six months,” said Brody of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. “You don’t see people talking about the current leadership … the way they did about Aya 18 months ago. You just don’t.”Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesBitcoinE-commercefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Obviously, our CapEx spend this year is an eye towards the future,” Pichai said, in response. “We are constantly planning for the long-term.” Pichai added that he expects Google to “go through the year in a supply-constrained way”.Alphabet’s chief financial officer, Anat Ashkenazi, elaborated on the ways Google is trying to free up capital. According to Ashkenazi, that includes constructing its own datacenters “to ensure that we do it in the most efficient way”, having an AI-powered toolknown asa “coding agent” write about half the company’s codes (before being reviewed by engineers), and using AI across departments, even for smaller tasks such as handling invoices.“We’re seeing our AI investments and infrastructure drive revenue and growth across the board,”Pichai said.Alphabet’s annual revenue exceeded $400bn for the first time, Pichai added.The company reported $113.83bn in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025 – surpassing Wall Street estimates of $111.43bn. Earnings per share (EPS) also beat Wall Street expectations: the company reported $2.82 in EPS, compared with estimates of $2.63.The report comes after several months of good news for the company in the AI race.The newest version of Gemini, released by Google in November, is considered to be at the forefront of the generative AI industry, a development that hasprompted panicat competitor OpenAI. Alphabet’s stockjumped 3%when Google debuted the model.Then in January, Google and Apple announcedthe company will start using Gemini to power AI features like Siri; the Apple assistant has previously facedcriticismfor not being as advanced and accurate as its competitors. Google’s valuationshot up to $4tnafter the deal, making it the second-most-valuable company in the world.Analysts viewed the multi-year agreement as ahuge winfor Google: the tech giant beat out competitors like OpenAI, and got access to Apple’s user base of2.5bn active devices.“Gemini is becoming the AI engine for the world’s most successful software companies,” Pichai said on Wednesday.Alphabet’s projected spending on AI infrastructure means its capital expenditure could as much as double this year. Shares were volatile in after-hours trading, with investors weighing the swell in spending against surging revenue and profit.Like larger rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure,GoogleCloud has been grappling with capacity constraints, and Pichai said the expenditures were necessary “to meet customer demand and capitalize on the growing opportunities we have ahead of us”.But investors have increasingly grown concerned about payoffs from AI investments, as the big cloud companies collectively spend massive amounts building out their infrastructure. Meta last week hiked capital investment for AI development this year by 73%.As the AI arms race heats up, Google’s Gemini AI assistant app exceeded 750 million users per month, Pichai said, up by 100 million compared with November.The driverless car divisionWaymois working to integrate the AI model, and Google announced that itsChrome browserwill adapt more Gemini AI features, too.Google is still dealing with scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators; the company has faced years of legal battles with US antitrust regulators over allegations it built anillegal monopolyover online search and advertising. That fight resurged this week when the Department of Justice and several states filed an appeal to a landmark antitrust ruling last year, in which a judge imposed onlymodest limitson the company’s contracts. The federal government wanted tougher restrictions. Google executives did not discuss the legal proceedings on the earnings call.Explore more on these topicsGoogleQuarterly resultsAlphabetnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Where they were once a simple rolling deck, treadmills today are often glossy pieces of interactive tech. Many now offer on-demand, real-time workouts (pioneered by Peloton) and the latest blockbuster movies via streaming services. Even if your treadmill doesn’t sport a whopping touchscreen display, it probably works nicely with heart-rate monitors, smartwatches and smartphone apps to track workouts and offer performance statistics after every session.Runningdecks have become more cushioned to offer better joint protection, and motor technology is now quieter and more efficient than ever. A treadmill still takes up a fair amount of space, but there are now compact folding options to help address this.The best treadmills on sale now are a far cry from those torturous devices designed to make the incarcerated sweat away their sins, offering ingenious ways to keep fit and, perhaps more importantly, makefitnessmore fun.At a glanceBest treadmill overall:Peloton Tread£3,499 at AmazonBest budget treadmill:JTX Slimline£549 at JTX FitnessBest for gym quality:JTX Sprint-9 Pro£1,549 at JTX FitnessBest folding treadmill:ProForm Pro 9000£1,429 at ProFormWhy you should trust meAs a fitness fan partaking in gym-based strength training, outdoor trail runs, kickboxing classes and cold-water surfing, I have long been tasked with testing exercise gear for leading fitness and technology magazines.Whatever I’m testing, I’ve always been one to get stuck in, whether that’s surfing with the latestsmartwatchin cold weather or feeling the burn with a set of connected kettlebells.I’m a strong believer in living with new-fangled tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I’ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the right environment. When it comes to treadmills, that has been to the detriment of any additional storage space my terrace house offers.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I aimed to rack up as much mileage as possible.’Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianWithout wanting to become a “first-world problems” meme, testing treadmills isn’t easy. They’re massive, for one, which means logistical management in having them delivered and then collected.I tested all the treadmills on this list over several months, trialling some systems for weeks, and others over a couple of arduous sessions. Where I could introduce a model to my home, I did. If it didn’t fit there, it was shoehorned into an office space I rent.Failing that, I arranged to get hands-on (or should that be feet-on?) with a model at the manufacturer’s headquarters or a dedicated showroom. One of the treadmills was handily used by my local gym.With every treadmill, I aimed to test all the connected features, typically pairing a smartwatch (AppleandGarmin) and a chest-based heart-rate monitor, as well as trialling any on-demand video and audio services. Where relevant, I tried live and on-demand workouts on any subscription packages and any gamified content available.During each test, I aimed to rack up as much mileage as possible, sweating it out over longer runs and more intense sprint sessions. If an elevation feature was available, I activated it, and if there was sled or resistance training, I’d dive into that too.Most of the treadmills were tested in a space where I could assess how much noise they made when in use, rather than trialling them in a busy gym where the thump of a deck or the whine of an electric motor is typically drowned out by background noise.All of the units were only ever offered to me on a loan basis, so they’ve made their way back to their respective suppliers. Due to this, it would be wrong of me to comment on their longevity or ability to withstand years of abuse, although I did get a good feel for build quality in the time I spent with them.The best treadmills in 2026View image in fullscreen‘Opens up a world of on-treadmill training sessions, live classes and in-depth programmes’: the Peloton Tread.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianBest treadmill overall:Peloton TreadPelotonTreadfrom£3,499£3,499 at Peloton£3,499 at AmazonWhat we loveWorkouts are engaging – and addictiveWhat we don’t loveIt’s expensive, and so is the subscriptionPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£3,499 at Peloton£3,499 at AmazonPelotonarguably dragged the treadmill into the 21st century when it launched the Tread. The brand ushered in an era of on-demand classes led by real instructors, accountability in the form of live leaderboards and a plethora of engaging workouts able to be performed anywhere and at any time.Who knew that bolting a big touchscreen to a fairly standard treadmill would cause such a stir? However, Peloton sales soared during the pandemic, and it continues to be one of the best products for most people, beginners and seasoned runners alike. As a result, it has spawned several rivals.In terms of cushioning, noise levels and deck comfort, the treadmill experience offered by the Peloton Tread is good, but it’s not the best out there. In fact, there are better for the money. But what makes Peloton worth the cost is that its fitness ecosystem of live and on-demand classes is so good. There’s very little else out there that’s as fun, engaging and supportive, helping not only those at the beginning of their fitness journey but also improving performance in more serious athletes.Why we love itPeloton’s treadmill itself is a neat piece of equipment, with its compact and easy-to-live-with design slotting into most domestic settings. The unit is competitive in terms of its top speeds and max incline (20km/h and 12.5% grade), while two simple roller mechanisms control both. During some sessions, the Tread will automatically adjust, depending on the goals.Although neither the quietest nor the most cushioned deck to run on, this machine majors in its expansive All-Access membership. This opens up a world of on-treadmill training sessions, live classes hosted by instructors who have now gained quasi-celebrity status, and in-depth training programmes covering everything from couch to 5K up to marathon prep.Should you not feel like being instructed by a bubbly, gorgeous and irritatingly tanned personal instructor, you can always binge movies, audiobooks and live and on-demand TV shows by harnessing the Peloton Entertainment app offering, or pump a popular music playlist from the impressive 26W front-facing speakers. This is all delivered via the crisp 23.8in full colour, high-definition touchscreen.Although there are now rivals that offer a similar level of interactivity and technology, few have managed to nail the execution quite like Peloton. It’s fun, highly polished and motivating, all at the same time. Above all else, it’s addictive – and surely that’s all you can ask for in the quest to keep fit.It’s a shame that …it’s expensive, and membership to online classes costs an additional £45 a month.Dimensions:84 x 173 x 157cm (WLH)Weight:132kgRunning area:50 x 150cmMax speed:20km/hMax incline:12.5%Folding:noBuilt-in entertainment:yes, through Peloton’s dedicated Entertainment appPelotonTreadfrom£3,499£3,499 at Peloton£3,499 at AmazonWhat we loveWorkouts are engaging – and addictiveWhat we don’t loveIt’s expensive, and so is the subscriptionBest budget treadmill:JTX SlimlineJTXSlimline£549£549 at JTX FitnessWhat we loveCompact, lightweight and affordableWhat we don’t loveNot sturdy enough for intense workouts£549 at JTX FitnessIf you can overlook the fact that this doesn’t feel as robust as its larger, static rivals (see below), this Slimline model from JTX is perfect for those who lack the space at home for a full-size treadmill – it folds flat and can easily be moved into storage when not in use.The company also offersan incline version(about £699), which feels surprisingly stable at maximum incline when running, but this cheaper and more basic option is perfect for those who prefer jogging, lower-impact training or simply those who want to increase their daily step count.With a 16km/h top speed, it’s no slouch, but the narrow deck and 1.75hp motor won’t suit those hoping for a more punishing workout.Why we love itUnlike so many treadmills available today, the JTX Slimline is compact and lightweight, making it relatively easy to wheel around tighter spaces. After all, not everyone is blessed with a dedicated gym at home, so we often have to make do with a temporary setup in the living room. The Slimline is perfect for this.The machine folds flat when it’s not in use, and it can be propped against a wall or tucked away in a cupboard to keep it out of sight. It features an impressive top speed, which is great for something so compact, while the small performance motor is relatively quiet.Users will have to bring their own entertainment in the form of a tablet or music played through headphones, but the unit does feature built-in Bluetooth so it can relay running data to accompanying apps, such asStravaor theZwiftvirtual running software.It’s a shame that …it feels too flimsy to endure serious sprint training, yet it’s too large and bulky to take the place of a simple walking deck for daily step-count enthusiasts.Dimensions:70 x 152 x 125cm (WLH)Weight:43kgRunning area:45 x 122cmMax speed:16km/hMax incline:0%Folding:yesBuilt-in entertainment:noJTXSlimline£549£549 at JTX FitnessWhat we loveCompact, lightweight and affordableWhat we don’t loveNot sturdy enough for intense workoutsBest treadmill for gym quality:JTX Sprint-9 ProJTXSprint-9 Profrom£1,549£1,549 at JTX Fitness£1,699 at AmazonWhat we loveBuilt to last, and suits serious runnersWhat we don’t loveNo interactive screen or fancy features£1,549 at JTX Fitness£1,699 at AmazonJTX likes to pride itself on offering commercial-grade fitness equipment for those on a domestic budget. The resulting kit is built to last, comes with a generous warranty and provides a similar experience to what you might find in your local gym.The Sprint-9 Pro may lack the bells, whistles and interactive touchscreens of more expensive rivals, but it has a generously sized running deck, a powerful 4hp brushless motor, and a whopping 22km/h top speed at an 11% max incline.Why we love itWith its punchy motor and serious incline, this treadmill makes it possible to achieve a challenging workout without a fitness professional telling you what to do. You can always set up a tablet or smartphone to indulge in a Peloton-esque experience with the appropriate apps and subscriptions, of course, but JTX also offers 36 preinstalled workout programmes for those who like to keep things slightly more analogue.The build quality is excellent, the CushionStep running deck spacious and comfortable, and the built-in Bluetooth speakers make it possible to soundtrack a run when paired with a tablet or phone – just don’t expect Ibiza club levels of sound quality.Don’t be fooled by its lack of an interactive screen: the Sprint-9 Pro still synchronises running data with services such as Zwift, Strava andKinomap(as well as connecting to Bluetooth heart-rate monitors). You just have to provide your own technology to make the most of these features.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t have easy-to-reach adjustment dials for speed and incline, and the built-in heart-rate sensors aren’t the most comfortable to hold.Dimensions:84 x 195 x 155cm (WLH)Weight:125kgRunning area:55 x 152cmMax speed:22km/hMax incline:11%Folding:noBuilt-in entertainment:noJTXSprint-9 Profrom£1,549£1,549 at JTX Fitness£1,699 at AmazonWhat we loveBuilt to last, and suits serious runnersWhat we don’t loveNo interactive screen or fancy featuresBest folding treadmill:ProForm Pro 9000ProFormPro 9000from£1,429£1,429 at ProForm£1,599 at John LewisWhat we loveCan fold up to save spaceWhat we don’t loveSlightly narrower running deck£1,429 at ProForm£1,599 at John LewisFolding treadmills can lack the build quality and premium features of their non-collapsible counterparts, but the Pro 9000 is one of the few that aims to pack in the tech. A 3.6hp motor doesn’t want for power, offering a 22km/h top speed and a respectable 12% incline, while the deck features ReBound Pro Cushioning for a little flex underfoot to protect the joints.There’s a compromise when it comes to running deck space, though, as it’s slightly narrower than larger, fixed treadmills. However, folding it up is a simple process and, when placed in its upright position, it can be rolled into a cupboard or stored against a wall to free up space.Why we love itIt’s easy to scrimp on features when producing a folding treadmill, but ProForm packs a lot in here … not to mention an impressive running experience. The motor is plenty powerful enough, with a top speed that rivals anything here, while the Digital Quick Decline/Incline control is great for brutal hill sprint sessions. The deck is great at reaching the desired incline or decline at speed.ProForm has long partnered withiFit, which provides a similar on-demand and live workout environment to Peloton and Technogym. This can be accessed via the wifi-enabled 21.5in HD colour touchscreen display. Users will have to pay a separate monthly subscription, though.ProForm allows access to several streaming services with the touchscreen, as well as the ability to stream music through the twin 2in speakers mounted just below the screen. However, don’t expect mind-blowing performance from these, as it’s often best to stick a pair of headphones on instead.It’s a shame that …it’s not lighter to make packing away a little easier – and the built-in cooling fan is borderline useless.Dimensions:90 x 196 x 151cm (WLH)Weight:119kgRunning area:51 x 152cmMax speed:22km/hMax incline:12%Folding:yesBuilt-in entertainment:yesProFormPro 9000from£1,429£1,429 at ProForm£1,599 at John LewisWhat we loveCan fold up to save spaceWhat we don’t loveSlightly narrower running deckThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘The quietest indoor running experience I have ever had’: the Technogym Run.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianDecathlon Domyos T900DDecathlonDomyos T900Dfrom£699.99£699.99 at Decathlon£699.99 at ArgosWhat we loveGenerous running deck and robustly builtWhat we don’t loveBasic display and buttons; not the prettiest£699.99 at Decathlon£699.99 at ArgosBest for:running app aficionadosThe T900D is one of the sports brand’s most robust units. It offers pro-grade running speeds and max inclines that can rival more expensive treadmills, and it folds for convenient storage.It lacks the connected pizazz of some of the models I’ve tested, and the big, often difficult-to-operate buttons and basic display make it feel like a throwback to treadmills of yore. Yet it performs admirably, offering a generous deck for taller people, as well as simple connectivity with third-party apps, such as Strava and Kinomap.It didn’t make the final cut because…the build quality isn’t as hardy, and it’s not the nicest piece of design.Dimensions:88 x 185 x 147cm (WLH);weight:89kg;running area:50 x 143cm;max speed:18km/h;max incline:10%;folding:yes;built-in entertainment:noDecathlonDomyos T900Dfrom£699.99£699.99 at Decathlon£699.99 at ArgosWhat we loveGenerous running deck and robustly builtWhat we don’t loveBasic display and buttons; not the prettiestLife Fitness T3Life FitnessT3from£2,632£2,632 at Gym Equipment£2,995 at John LewisWhat we loveExcellent build qualityWhat we don’t loveFeatures and built-in programmes are basic£2,632 at Gym Equipment£2,995 at John LewisBest for:withstanding everyday useLife Fitness is a common sight in UK gyms and this exact model is in place in one of the fitness facilities I use weekly. It has a basic LCD screen that provides all the running data most users demand, and sessions can be programmed, with control over incline and speeds.The build quality is excellent – it’s able to withstand regular punishment – but that is reflected in the price, especially considering the rather basic nature of its built-in programmes and lack of connected features. This is just a good old-fashioned treadmill, which is less likely to cause reliability headaches than some cheaper rivals.It didn’t make the final cut because…it looks great in a commercial gym, but it’s too basic and bulky for the home.Dimensions:88 x 202 x 147cm (WLH);weight:111kg;running area:51 x 153cm;max speed:19km/h;max incline:15%;folding:yes;built-in entertainment:noLife FitnessT3from£2,632£2,632 at Gym Equipment£2,995 at John LewisWhat we loveExcellent build qualityWhat we don’t loveFeatures and built-in programmes are basicNordicTrack EXP5iNordicTrackEXP5i£999£999 at Gym Equipment SuperstoreWhat we loveLightweight and folds upWhat we don’t loveLow top speed and no interactive touchscreen£999 at Gym Equipment SuperstoreBest for:immersive training without the big screenThis is another folding option that follows the ProForm line of thinking – chiefly, a solid running experience without the additional cost of a large touchscreen display. Instead, users are encouraged to tether a smartphone or tablet and make the most of the iFit app, which requires a monthly subscription but opens up the chance to take part in live classes and on-demand workouts. Weighing 90kg, the EXP5i is, however, lighter than the ProForm Pro 9000, and I found it easier to wheel around. The build quality is also excellent.It didn’t make the final cut because …the running deck is shorter and narrower than many competitors, while the 16km/h top speed will disappoint sprinters.Dimensions:87 x 180 x 152cm (WLH);weight:90kg;running area:51 x 140cm;max speed:16km/h;max incline:10%;folding:yes;built-in entertainment:noNordicTrackEXP5i£999£999 at Gym Equipment SuperstoreWhat we loveLightweight and folds upWhat we don’t loveLow top speed and no interactive touchscreenTechnogym RunTechnogymRun£10,340£10,340 at TechnogymWhat we loveQuiet, and great resistance featuresWhat we don’t loveThe price£10,340 at TechnogymBest for:premium quality and all-encompassing workoutsThis Italian manufacturer loves nothing more than taking standard gym kit and injecting it with some serious, athlete-inspired smarts. The latest Technogym Run features a slat belt deck, which is not only more cushioning on the knees and other joints but also offers the quietest indoor running experience I have ever tested.Sitting at the premium end of the spectrum, many will balk at the Run’s asking price. But this machine goes beyond merely offering a platform to run on because of its ability to mimic a weighted sled with its Multidrive resistance technology. When set in this mode, users can strengthen muscles in the lower body or intersperse sled work with sprints for high-intensity interval training.In addition, Technogym offers access to all its live and on-demand classes, scenic virtual runs and off-tread workouts, which include strength training, yoga and more. Pair it with the firm’s other intelligent fitness equipment and you’ll have one of the smartest setups around.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s priced way beyond what most mere mortals can afford.Dimensions:83 x 197 x 175cm (WLH);weight:207kg;running area:51 x 173cm;max speed:25km/h;max incline:15%;folding:no;built-in entertainment:yes, with the Technogym app store allowing access to YouTube, Disney+, Spotify and many moreTechnogymRun£10,340£10,340 at TechnogymWhat we loveQuiet, and great resistance featuresWhat we don’t loveThe priceWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenHow much should I spend?There’s a treadmill to suit most budgets, but those with touchscreen displays and interactive features will cost more. The same goes for the most powerful motors, advanced running deck technology and greater connectivity features, as these all demand healthier budgets.The most affordable treadmills generally start at about £500 – anything less than that isn’t typically worth your money. Prices then rise to £3,000 or more (see the Technogym Run) for the most technologically advanced and commercial-grade units.The best massage guns: tried and tested relief for sore, tired musclesRead moreHow much room do you need?The smallest treadmill on this list still measures 70 x 152 x 125cm (WLH) and you will want to factor in some wriggle room around that to ensure your arms aren’t bashing against a wall and your head isn’t hitting the ceiling. If storage space is a problem, take a look at the folding treadmills on this list. Typically, they fold flat and feature wheels so that they can be rolled into a more convenient space and stored upright to keep the floor clear.What features should I look out for?More serious runners should look at more powerful motors because they often provide the fastest running speeds and a more natural running experience. Incline and decline features are great for mimicking runs out in the wild, and a well-cushioned deck is important for protecting the joints.Most manufacturers don’t cite figures for decibel levels emitted during operation, but it’s worth considering that some treadmills are quieter than others. Finally, connected features are fantastic for keeping track of training, ensuring runs are interesting and generally entertaining during an arduous workout. However, that doesn’t mean you necessarily need a massive display, as tethering a tablet or a smartphone can do just as good a job.How do I oil my treadmill at home?It’s always best to consult the user manual for details on how to lubricate a treadmill belt and how often to do so, as some brands produce systems that don’t need any maintenance and this could void a warranty.Use a 100% silicone lubricant that the manufacturer supplies, or buy adedicated treadmill lubricantto avoid damaging the belt. Unplug the treadmill, lift the edges of the treadmill belt and apply lubricant in a zigzag fashion to the centre where your feet strike. Turn on the treadmill and walk slowly for about two minutes to allow the lubricant to work its way across the entirety of the running deck.Treadmills vs walking padsWhile a treadmill can be used for walking, it’s typically more versatile than awalking padin that it can support jogging sessions and faster training. Higher-end treadmills will also have more features than a walking pad, such as the ability to automatically adjust incline and decline, connect to on-demand workout programmes from the likes of Peloton and iFit, and offer built-in workouts. On the other hand, walking pads are usually smaller and easier to store, with some folding in half so they can be housed underneath a desk when not in use.For more:The best running watchesThe best cross trainersLeon Poultney has been traversing the worlds of consumer technology and automotive for some of thebiggest lifestyle websites and magazines for longer than he cares to divulge.

That makes them super comfortable for long periods of listening time without feeling as if they’re going to fall out, even during vigorous movement.The disk is touch-sensitive for tap controls for playback, noise cancelling and accessing Gemini. They work well but they lack the excellent swipe gesture for volume control from the Pixel Buds Pro 2, which is a shame.The battery lasts a solid seven or so hours with noise cancelling while the compact flip-top case recharges the buds about 1.8 times for a total of 20 hours playback. The case is great, but the white picks up marks easily, including staining from jeans and other clothing.SpecificationsWater resistance:IP54 (splash resistant)Connectivity:Bluetooth5.4 (SBC, AAC)Battery life:7h with ANC (20h with case)Earbud dimensions:23.1 x 16 x 17.8mmEarbud weight:4.7g eachDriver size:11mmCharging case dimensions:50 x 57.2 x 24.5mmCharging case weight:47.6gCase charging:USB-CNot just for AndroidView image in fullscreenThe Android app handles settings and updates, including an equaliser for customising sound, or you can use Google’s web app on a computer.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Buds 2a have the same Google Tensor A1 chip as their Pro siblings, which ensures rock-solid connectivity with any standard Bluetooth device, including Android phones, iPhones, tablets, consoles and computers.

Those in similar devices typically maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for 500 full charge cycles.

They do a good job with most genres, with solid separation of tones, plenty of bass where needed and relatively detailed mids and highs. They sound great with rock, pop and electronica, but lack a bit of nuance in classical tracks.The Buds 2a also support spatial audio with compatible phones, but not head-tracking, which is a feature reserved for their more expensive siblings. It works well with film and TV shows with a Pixel phone.The new buds are the first in Google’s A-series to have active noise cancelling. It is not quite as effective as that in the Buds Pro 2, but does a very good job for the money. It reduces road roar and engine noise, street sounds and background hubbub, but struggles to keep out higher tones such as the clicks of keyboards or chatter in the office.The cheaper buds also lack adaptive sound and the ability to automatically dampen loud noise when using the ambient sound mode, but I don’t think they are crucial features.PriceThe Google Pixel Buds 2a cost£109(€129/$129/A$239).For comparison, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 cost£169, theNothing Ear 3cost£149, theFairphone Fairbudscost£66.75, theApple AirPods 4cost from£119and theAirPods Pro 3cost£219.VerdictThe Pixel Buds 2a are a great set of Bluetooth earbuds for more than just Android at a good price.Their compact form and shape make them very comfortable and discreet, lacking the stalks that are popular with rivals. The battery life is solid, the case nice and compact, and they work well, connecting to two devices at once.They sound great for everyday earbuds and the noise cancelling is good for the money. They lack a few bells and whistles including onboard volume control, adaptive audio and wireless charging, plus their call quality is only average.One of the best upgrades is an easily replaceable battery in the case, which is progress towards better sustainability. But the batteries in the earbuds remain irreplaceable, ultimately making them disposable.Pros:compact, comfortable, seven-hour battery, great case, good sound and noise cancelling, multipoint Bluetooth, case with replaceable battery, web app for use with computers.Cons:earbuds unrepairable, no volume control gesture, no support for higher quality Bluetooth formats, average call quality, no adaptive audio or loud noise protection for transparencyExplore more on these topicsGooglePixelAlphabetHeadphonesBluetoothGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

We must offer a positive vision that will improve the lives of AmericansThu 5 Feb 2026 11.30 ESTLast modified on Thu 5 Feb 2026 13.47 ESTShareAt this difficult moment in American history, it’s imperative that we have the courage to be honest with ourselves.The United States, once the envy of the world, is now a nation in profound decline. For the sake of our children and future generations, we must reverse that decline and change, in very fundamental ways, the direction of our country.Not so long ago, the US was admired for its democracy, constitution, rule of law, strong middle class and an American dream which promised that our kids and grandchildren would have a better life than their parents.Tragically, that is no longer the case.We used to have the strongest and most vibrant middle class on Earth. Not any more. Today 60% of our people are living paycheck to paycheck and we have more income and wealth inequality than any other major country. Despite huge advances in technology and worker productivity, real weekly wages for the average American worker are lower today than they were 53 years ago.Donald Trump is making China great again | Steven GreenhouseRead moreWe used to be the best-educated country on Earth, with an excellent public school system and the highest percentage of young people graduating from college than any other country. Not any more. Today, the US ranks well behind its peers in overall educational attainment, our childcare system is broken and millions of our young people are unable to afford a college education.We used to have the best healthcare system in the world. Not any more. Despite spending far more per capita on healthcare than any other nation, 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured, our life expectancy is lower than most wealthy nations and we have a massive shortage in doctors, nurses, dentists, mental health counselors and other healthcare professionals.We used to be a country with decent, affordable housing. Not any more. Since the pandemic, the median home price has risen by 55% to more than $410,000. Today, more than 20m households are spending more than half of their limited incomes on housing and nearly 800,000 people are homeless. Today, young couples are buying their first home, on average, 10 years later in life than their parents.We used to have a reasonably nutritious food system. Not any more. Today, as a result of corporate agriculture and the greed of the food and beverage industry, many of our kids are addicted to ultra-processed foods and we have the highest rate of obesity and diabetes of any major country on Earth.We used to have the most advanced transportation system in the world. Not any more. Our public transportation and rail systems lag far behind most other developed countries and millions of people spend hours a day in traffic jams.But the decline we are seeing in our country is not just in economics. Our political system is corrupt, dominated by an extremely greedy billionaire class that is able to buy and sell politicians.Even more troubling, our country is rapidly descending into authoritarianism under an unstable, narcissistic leader who wants more and more power for himself.Donald Trump is usurping the powers of Congress, attacking the courts, intimidating the media, threatening universities, and prosecuting and arresting his political opponents.We are living through one of the most difficult moments in the history of our countryAnd then, on top of all that, there is Trump’s domestic army, ICE, an agency which, every day, is acting in outrageous and unconstitutional ways.ICE is occupying and terrorizing communities, kicking down doors without due process, sending five-year-old children to detention centers, illegally deporting people and shooting down American citizens in cold blood.Further, Trump’s authoritarianism extends far beyond our own borders.Today, we have a president who feels far more comfortable with the dictatorships of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE than with the democratic nations in Europe, a president who, along with Elon Musk and others, is supporting rightwing extremist parties throughout the world.We have a president who has given unconditional support to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, a war criminal who is under indictment by the international criminal court for his genocidal policies.We have a president who violates international law with impunity by illegally attacking Venezuela, absurdly suggesting that Canada become our 51st state and, insanely, threatening to seize Greenland from Denmark.So where do we go from here? How do we reverse America’s decline? How do we create an economy that works for working people and not just billionaires, a vibrant democracy and a foreign policy based on international law?The answer is not complicated. We do it by building a national grassroots movement that fights for the needs of the American working class. We do it by bringing people together – Black, white, Latino, Asian, gay and straight – around an agenda that takes on the greed of the oligarchs and is based on the foundation of economic, social, racial and environmental justice.Is this an impossible dream? Can it be done? You bet it can.Zohran Mamdani’s successful grassroots campaign in New York City has given us the roadmap.Starting at just 1% in the polls, Mamdani had the guts to take on the Democratic establishment, the Republican establishment and the oligarchs. And he won by organizing a grassroots campaign of more than 90,000 volunteers knocking on doors behind a strong progressive agenda.Yes. What Mamdani accomplished in New York City can and should be replicated in all 50 states.The lesson of Mamdani’s campaign is clear: it is not good enough just to be critical of Trump and his destructive policies. We must bring forth a positive vision that will improve the lives of ordinary Americans.Here are just a few of the issues that must be addressed:We must create a vibrant democracy by ending Citizens United and preventing billionaires from buying elections.Whether the Democratic establishment likes it or not, we must guarantee healthcare as a human right through Medicare for All.We must build millions of affordable homes and apartments and give our younger generation the opportunity to own a home of their own.We must make public colleges, universities, trade schools and medical schools tuition-free and have the best childcare and public school system in the entire world.We must expand social security and bring back traditional pension plans so that every senior in this country can retire with dignity.We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage and guarantee every worker the right to join a union.We must demand that the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations in America pay their fair share in taxes.We are living through one of the most difficult moments in the history of our country. But the truth is that, throughout our nation’s history, we have faced great challenges before. From the revolutionary war to the abomination of slavery, from the Great Depression to the second world war, and from the century-long struggle for civil rights to the struggles for women’s rights, workers’ rights and LGBTQ+ rights, the people of our nation fought for justice – and prevailed. And we can do it again.In times of great crisis, the American people came together and chose democracy over authoritarianism, justice over greed, solidarity over division. They understood in the past – and we understand today – that when we stand together, no matter how much money and power the oligarchs have, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish.That is how we reverse America’s decline, renew our democracy, and build a future worthy of our children and generations yet to come.Bernie Sanders is a US senator, and ranking member of the health, education, labor and pensions committee.

Unfortunately for the American people, if Trump’s maneuvers and machinations have made any nation greater, it’s been China, not the United States.During Trump’s first term, he treatedChinaas a strategic rival and often talked of checking its rise. His administration complained that China was seeking to“challenge American power”and “erode American security and prosperity”. But during his first year back in the White House, Trump – in governing by whim and impulse with little strategic vision - has done lots to Make China Great Again.His shortsighted policies have enabled China to gain on, and at times move ahead of, the US in numerous ways. That was true when Trump’s benighted crusade against scientific research weakened the US’s competitive position vis-à-vis China. That was also the case when Trump so mucked up his trade war with China thatBeijing emerged victoriousafter it forced Trump to back down. That was true, as well, when Trump ceded long-term leadership to China in several critical industries of the future, including electric cars, wind turbines and batteries.Trump’s imperialistic designs on Venezuela and Greenland have made it harder to argue against China’s own designs on Taiwan. What’s more, Trump’s nonstop trade war, his threats against Greenland, and his torrent of insults against our European allies have badly undermined the western alliance, and that, too, will weaken the US and strengthenChina.In a newly releasedsurvey of 26,000 people in 21 countries, the European Council of Foreign Relations found not only that Trump’s policies are helping make China great, but that the US’s traditional adversaries fear it less, while its allies feel more distant from the US. In apolicy brief accompanying that poll, Timothy Garton Ash, an emeritus history professor at Oxford and Guardian columnist, and two co-authors wrote: “Donald Trump did not go into politics to make China great again. But that is what [this new] poll … suggests he has done in the eyes of the world.”Last July, when Trump’s tariffs were creating havoc worldwide, Pew releaseda 23-country surveythat found for the first time that more people in those countries viewed China as the world’s top economic power than viewed the US as the leading power. According to Pew, a median of 41% of adults surveyed in the 23 countries saw China as the foremost economic power, compared with 39% for the US. In other words, despite Trump’s America First ballyhoo, China has been on the rise, with the US declining.Trump has so angered Canada, long the US’s closest ally, with his painfully hightariffsand his belittling talk about making it the 51st state that Canada has increasingly looked elsewhere for friends. It just forgeda new strategic partnershipwith China that will help Canada “adapt to new global realities” (namely, Trump’s hostility). “We’re forging new partnershipsaround the world to transform our economy from one that has been reliant on a single trade partner,” said Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney.Other longtime US allies are also unhappy about Trump’s unreliability, irascibility and trade tirades, and they, too, are strengthening ties with China. In the first such visit since 2019, South Korea’s president recently visited Beijing and signed more thana dozen agreementson technology and trade. Britain’s prime minster, Keir Starmer,met with China’s president, Xi Jinping, last weekto pull the two countries’ relations out of a long “ice age”, while the German chancellor,Friedrich Merz, will visit in late February. All this diplomatic reshuffling stems from what Carney called a US-induced“rupture in the world order”.Joe Biden worked hard to maintain the US’s technological edge over China, especially on the use of artificial intelligence in the military. One major strategy was to prohibit sales of Nvidia’s most sophisticated AI chips to China. But Trump, facing strong pleas from his billionaire friends and donors in Silicon Valley, reversed Biden’s policy and decades of technological restrictions. He defied many national security advisers andgave Nvidia a green lightto sell China some of its most sophisticated chips.“This decision is nuts,”Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, told the New York Times. “China’s main problem is they don’t have enough advanced computing capability. It makes no sense that President Trump is solving their problem for them by selling them powerful American chips. We are literally handing away our advantage.”Trump no doubt hoped that the stratospherically high tariffs he imposed on China would weaken its powerful role in global trade. But China trumped Trump in that trade showdown byrestricting badly needed rare earth exportsto the USand barring soybean importsfrom the US, causing many US farmers to grow angry at the president. Trump soon rolled back his high tariffs on China, enabling the world to see that China had succeeded in bullying the bully. What’s more, while China’s trade volume with the US declined in 2025, China’s worldwide trade surplussoared by 20% to a record $1.2 trillion, showing that China in some ways emerged stronger from its trade confrontation with Trump.In the newNational Security Strategy releasedlate last year, the Trump White House, unlike in its 2017 Security Survey, doesn’t talk of China as a strategic rival even though,as the New York Times’ David Sanger pointed out, China’s nuclear force has more than doubled since 2017, its military conducts exercises all around Taiwan, and its cyber-attacks have penetrated US government and corporations.But Trump’s National Security Survey ignores all that. Instead, Trump boasts elsewhere about having a“very good relationship”with the Russian president,Vladimir Putin, and Xi, the world’s two leading autocrats, all while he often belittles Europe’s leaders.Trump boasts that the US is the hottest country in the world, even though many countries’ views of the UShave cooled significantlysince he returned to the White House. What’s more, the US tourism industry is hurting because many foreigners now refuse to visit, and universities are hurting because many top foreign students are hesitating to study in the land of Trump. It’s true, though, that the US is the hottest country for some things – for mass deportations, for the scandal-plagued crypto industry and for AI companies; although, there are huge fears that today’s bubble of investments in datacenters will burst and cause a disastrous bust.There’s no denying that the man who vowed to make America great again has caused the US to lose immense respect around the world. With the most authoritarian president in history in the White House, it’s harder than ever for the US to claim to be the city on the hill, a beacon and protector of freedom and democracy. What’s more, longtime allies have lost trust in the US and grown wary of working with Washington. It goes without saying that when trust wanes and alliances weaken, that makes America less great.If Trump wants to reverse these sinking trends, he needs to patch up things asap with Canada, Denmark and many other US allies. He needs to end the insults, toss the imperialistic ambitions, reverse the deep cuts in research and begin championing democracy instead of cozying up with authoritarians. That unfortunately is probably asking way too much of Trump, who places spleen over reason and prefers authoritarianism to democracy.So despite all his swagger, it seems inevitable that Trump will continue to make America less great and grease the skids for China’s continued rise.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionChinaDonald TrumpAsia PacificUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Just hours later, Minnesotans gathered in their neighborhoods for vigils to mourn his death and demand an end to the federal incursion on their state.Meanwhile, the CEOs ofApple,Amazon, Zoom and the New York Stock Exchange attended aglitzy screeningof the new Melania documentary at the White House, where they munched on popcorn in special commemorative black-and-white boxes and took home Melania-branded cookies.That day offered a stark split-screen, with the courage of everyday people on one side, and the cowardice of elites on the other.Pretti and his fellow Minnesotans decided to risk physical abuse and even death to defend and support their neighbors. Minnesotans have modeled community and courage, and people from coast to coast have spoken up, donated and acted in solidarity. Following Pretti’s death, their determination has only grown.There is no shortage of courage in our country right now. It is just unevenly distributed.I knew Trump would target Minnesota. I didn’t expect this level of violence | Rachel LeingangRead moreIn the wake of Pretti’s death, US elites – those running major businesses, universities, law firms, media companies and other mainstream institutions, often hailing from the nation’s most exclusive academic institutions – have continued on their course of compliance and complacency.Countless leaders have responded to the authoritarian actions of Donald Trump’s second administration with silence. Numerous others have capitulated, paying exorbitant settlements and sacrificing the independence of organizations they lead at the altar of self-preservation. Many have sold out their professions’ fundamental principles such as academic freedom and free expression.Even amid the recent horrors in Minnesota, the state’s big corporations could muster only astatementof lackluster both-sidesism after Pretti’s death, “calling for an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions”. And while a handful of corporate leaders nationally have issued mostly muted statements for ICE to stand down, these calls have been few and far between and failed to match the gravity of the crisis we are facing.If the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti aren’t enough to jolt those leading major institutions out of their complacency, what will be?Capitulation is not just shameful; it’s dangerous. Scholars remind us that a strong and independent civil society is a crucial pillar for supporting democracy – and, when it is in jeopardy, curbing democratic decline. At their best, elite institutions and their leaders lend their reputations and their resources to promote civic dialogue, provide a check on government misdeeds and uphold fundamental rights. At their worst, they create a permission structure for wanton abuses of power.With the administration’s violations of fundamental rights andrepression accelerating, why have elites been so unwilling to stand up?Our country desperately needs elites to stand up and take a risk – and to harness the power of solidarityOne answer lies in the values and reward structures embedded in such institutions and ingrained in those who lead them. These leaders tend to have been raised to embrace a profound individualism paired with a heavy dose of conformism – a toxic combination that makes them less likely to speak up when we need them most.I know these values, because I was trained in them. I attended an elite prep school, a wealthy liberal arts college and graduate school at Oxford. At every step, my classmates and I learned to cultivate confidence in our individual talents – and to follow rules set forth by figures of authority.The result: many of my peers – who often went on to occupy leadership positions at major corporations, law firms and those same universities – learned to prize careerism and going along to get along above all else, including defending democratic values.After graduation, rather than joining my fellow elite graduates at investment banks or management consultancies, I went to work as a community organizer. For years, I witnessed people in precarious positions taking enormous chances for their families and communities. Tenants risked eviction to expose abusive landlords; restaurant workers risked their jobs to demand stolen wages; young immigrants risked arrest and deportation to demand legal recognition.Meanwhile, as white nationalism and an authoritarian movement became ascendant, I heard many of my privileged peers express private concern. This year, some attended No Kings protests. But few have joined or contributed significantly to organizations dedicated to stopping authoritarianism. When some former classmates expressed outrage about the incoming administration’s plans to undermine democratic institutions, I suggested they join a group training people to organize. No one took me up on the invitation.I see in this hesitance a discomfort with collective action built from a lifetime of celebrating individualism – and a deep aversion to risk. Earning large salaries in leadership positions, my one-time peers have seen others speak up and be pilloried or threatened. As former treasury secretary Robert Rubinrecently wrote: “Many [business] leaders harbor deep concerns about Mr Trump’s lawlessness, weaponization of the government, and interference in markets. They refrain from public criticism not because they find nothing to criticize but because they’re intimidated.” These elites understandably feel they have a lot to lose, but the cost of silence in this moment is simply too high.Most are also perplexed about how to best respond. Some have misinterpreted this moment as a difficult period they can ride out. Others who recognize the authoritarian breakthrough are unsure what they can do to stop it. They were trained to follow and exploit the rules of the game; now the rulebook is in tatters.The killings of Good and Pretti make it clearer than ever that we need a new rulebook. Our country desperately needs elites to stand up and take a risk – and to harness the power of solidarity. As we’ve seen in other countries and in too-rare cases here, when elites stand together, they can change the trajectory.Hundredsof philanthropic leaders publicly committed to stand together to defend their constitutional rights to give, speak and act freely, slowing administration attacks on the sector.Chicago business, faith and philanthropic leadersjoined togetherto denounce the reckless deployment of ICE and Customs and Border Protection officers across their city. Their principled unity demonstrated that the city’s major pillars opposed the federal incursion, a crucial development leading up to the supreme court decision requiring the withdrawal of troops.The presidents of Harvard, Princeton and MIT stood up for the independence of their institutions at considerable risk to their funding – and won reprieves in court.Those law firms that resisted executive orders against them have been winning their cases and notching new clients.Jimmy Kimmelsaw record ratings after fighting government censorship. Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve governor, appears poised to prevail at the supreme court against Trump’s attempt to unseat her.And, showing that principled resistance is not a question of political ideology, many Republican-appointed federal judges have blocked authoritarian policies that threaten the constitution; and longtime conservatives such as Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger and Bill Kristol continue to voice opposition to the administration’s authoritarian actions.But among the leaders of the country’s most august and powerful institutions, these examples remain the exception, not the rule. We badly need more institutions and leaders – from across the ideological spectrum – to stand up and stand together for democratic values.For inspiration, they would do well to look to the thousands of working-class people from Minnesota to Maine to Memphis who have risen bravely against violations of their neighbors’ rights and violence by federal agents, with only cellphones and whistles to protect their neighbors.If the elites across this country can find that same courage to speak up together for core democratic values, we can still prevent our country from descending into full-blown autocracy. We all need to remember that confidence we learned in school – and move past the conformism.Daniel Altschuler is the managing director of the Freedom Together Foundation and holds a doctorate in politics from the University of OxfordExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionUS immigrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationProtest (US)commentShareReuse this content"

We must stop a new arms raceEdward J MarkeyNew Start expires on Thursday. That leaves no limits on US and Russian nuclear arsenalsThu 5 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 5 Feb 2026 12.12 ESTShareLet’s be honest: America needs another nuclear weapon about as much asDonald Trumpdeserves a Nobel peace prize.Yet on Thursday, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the U S and Russiawill expire. When the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty – New Start – goes away, there will be no limits on US and Russian nuclear arsenals for the first time in more than 50 years.That is very bad news.Agreements like New Start helped end the cold war nuclear arms race. Many Americans are too young to remember that era. If you missed it the first time, I have news for you: it’s back.During Arms Race 1.0, Washington and Moscow conducted more than1,700 nuclear tests, contaminating the environment and making our own people sick. Now the US president wants to resume nuclear testing. We also built grotesquely large nuclear arsenals –more than 30,000 weapons each. Today we are down to about 4,000apiece – still far too many. We spent approximately$10tnin taxpayer money building these weapons – then paid again to dismantle most of them.For $10tn, you could buy Google, Apple and most of Microsoft.Expiry of nuclear weapons pact between US and Russia risks new arms raceRead moreBut the true cost wasn’t just financial. The arms race made the world vastly more dangerous: more weapons, more tension, more chances for miscalculation, more warheads that could be stolen or misused. Anyone who has studied the Cuban missile crisis knows the truth – we survived not because we were wise, but because we were lucky.No one should want to repeat that history. Yet Arms Race 2.0 is exactly where we are headed.I was recently struck by Kathryn Bigelow’s thriller A House of Dynamite. It’s a gripping film – and a wake-up call. The movie exposes a truth few in Washington will admit: despite hopes that long-range missile defense will protect us, it won’t. The only reliable way to escape nuclear catastrophe is to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the world.The US has spent hundreds of billions of dollars chasing long-range missile defense, yet it has never delivered dependable protection. The bloated contracts persist and the lobbyists prosper, but the logic is fatally flawed. Long-range defenses don’t work – and they make arms reductions harder. Our adversaries know exactly how to defeat them: build more offensive missiles.Rather than doubling down on the fool’s gold of missile defense – such as wasting trillions on Trump’s delusional “Golden Dome” – we should focus on what actually works: arms control and arms reductions. Treaties like New Start have cut nuclear arsenals byabout 90%, reducing the nuclear threat far more effectively than missile defense ever could. I would take New Start over “Golden Dome” any day. (Trump said he needed to control Greenlandin order to build “Golden Dome”. Well, we don’t need “Golden Dome” at all, and we sure don’t need to take over Greenland.)Today, our decades-long arms-reduction effort is on life support. As A House of Dynamite bluntly observes: “At the end of the cold war, nations reached consensus that we should have fewer nuclear weapons. That era is now over.”New arms control agreements take years to negotiate. Yet Washington and Moscow have not even begun talks on a replacement for New Start. Vladimir Putinhas offered to continueadhering to New Start limits for one year after it expires if the US does the same. That is a good idea, and an overwhelming majority of Americans (91%) say the US should negotiate a new agreement with Russia to maintain current limits or further reduce arsenals. But Trump has been noncommittal,saying, “If it expires, it expires.”That is unacceptable. We are out of time.If New Start ends with no commitment to respect its limits, both the US andRussiawill be free to expand their strategic nuclear arsenals. A new arms race will officially be under way.The central lesson of A House of Dynamite – and of history itself – is simple: more nuclear weapons do not make us safer. Nuclear deterrence is not a shield; it is an existential gamble. One mistake, one malfunction, one miscalculation could end everything.A new nuclear arms race is not the answer. Fewer weapons are.I have long pushed for deep, verifiable reductions in nuclear arsenals. We must re-engage on arms control not only with Russia, but also with China, and revive diplomacy with North Korea, Iran and other nuclear aspirants. Every warhead removed is one less catastrophe waiting to happen.If we truly care about future generations, we must have the courage to say: not one more dollar wasted on weapons of mass annihilation. The only nuclear defense worth believing in is disarmament – rooted in treaties, inspections and verification.As we say goodbye to New Start, we must commit to replacing it – and reject a new arms race. If we abandon nuclear arms control, a new arms buildup will rush in to fill the void. As history teaches us, the only way to win a nuclear arms race is to refuse to run.Edward J Markey represents Massachusetts in the US Senate.

Kraft encouraged two of his players – the twins Devin and Jason McCourty – into deeper citizenship, to engage with the legal and political systems and promote reforms. As a sign of compassion and a willingness to listen, Kraftvisitedthe incarcerated rapper Meek Mill, and later the two partnered with another artist, Jay-Z, on various criminal justice initiatives.Trump loomed over baseball’s Hall of Fame. But voters still said no to Bonds and ClemensRead moreOn 6 January 2021, when so many of the voices loudest in their opposition to player protests, the ones who said the dissenting ballplayers were treasonous for disrespecting both the American flag and law enforcement at the behest of outgoing presidentDonald Trumpstormed the US Capitol and contributed to the deaths of one policeman and the trauma and eventual deaths of several others, it was Kraft who was apparently so disgusted that he stopped talking to Trump, publicly distancing himself from the man to whose inauguration four years earlier he had donated $1m.Five years later, as the Patriots return to the Super Bowl for the first time since 2019, the American sporting and political landscape is far less principled. In the wake of Trump’s second election the athlete voice has been rendered politically dormant. The George Floyd moment is over, thethree-day “pause”after the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that shut down the sports world a lost memory in the hostile onrush of a racial retrenchment and restorative whiteness this country hasn’t seen since the dawn of the first world war.The players are silent, but the political aggression long attributed to the players remains. It just switched aisles. Trump’s return signaled to the NFL the coast was clear to retreat from its aspirational sloganeering. The flags and flyovers and remote shots of far-flung military bases are still embedded in the television broadcasts, but the words “End Racism” that once appeared in the back of end zones around the leaguehave disappeared. The vague “It Takes All of Us” remains, but “to do what, exactly?” is still unclear. A coaching cycle with 10 job openings these past few weeks resulted inthe hiring of zero Black coaches– recurring proof that teams hire minorities only when forced. The specter of Trump is omnipresent. The Harbaugh brothers – Giants coach John and Chargers coach Jim –openly embrace him. The feeling is mutual.Trump at the Super Bowl: how the NFL’s culture war ended in surrenderRead moreDuring this retrenchment, where was the former ostensible voice of reason? Kraft was back again with Trump, basking in toxic afterglow at the premiere of Melania, Amazon MGM Studios’ $40m documentary of Melania Trump. (The Guardian’s verdict:zero stars.) Bygones, it seems, are bygones.Kraft’s reversal represents the malleable ethics of the billionaire class, of the consistent gaslighting of a sporting public that desperately wants to see goodness in their games, for sports to lack the stench of the myriad pollutants associated with power, from the willful breaking of brains and bodies, to gambling, to Trump, to somehow be separate from the entire noxious atmosphere. Such is not possible.View image in fullscreenRobert Kraft and the Patriots visited Donald Trump at the White House after their Super Bowl win in 2017.Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesThat leaves Kraft. His team is triumphantly back, but as the country slips deeper into authoritarianism, he now looks as exposed and weary as the players, a man who has lost his nerve and fallen predictably back in line. He did not have to go far. Kraft did not offer Trump another $1m for last year’s inauguration – according to Federal Election Commission filings, the slack was picked up by gambling titans DraftKings ($502,000) and FanDuel ($482,000) – but for all of his supposed outrage over January 6, there he was, dancing on stage with Trump, contributing to circuses even as the bread grows less affordable. Kraft has apparently made peace with the man who encouraged an attack on his own country, who swore he had nothing to with the violence, and then, once back in office, ordered the Department of Justice to settle with the family of Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed by police while trying to breach a window into the Capitol. Babbitt’s family wasawarded$5m and Babbitt posthumously restored full military honors by Trump, who thenimmediately pardonedroughly 1,500 of the convicted rioters.When he first arrived 33 years ago, Kraft captured the Boston fan’s heart. The humble everyman season-ticket holder not only rose from the metal benches of old Schaefer Stadium to own the team and keep it in Massachusetts, but transformed the lowly, dysfunctional, often highly comical Patriots into something no New Englander ever imagined: an A-list championship standard that would so eclipse the foundational, bedrock names of the sport – Dallas and Pittsburgh, Oakland and Miami – that his success and influence would be met with a staggeringly small vindictiveness, evidenced by him and his legendary coach, Bill Belichick,failing to be inductedto the Pro Football Hall of Fame this year.If his re-engagement with Trump may be forgiven as an innocuous example of pragmatic politics, it is not. Kraft certainly is a businessman first, and like most businessmen, he has been politically bipartisan, supporting Democratic candidates – including Barack Obama for president – as well as Republicans locally and nationally. By celebrating Trump, however, he has enjoined something more darker and less credible as the times darken and America deludes itself into believing today’s moment is merely uncomfortable for some, triumphant for others, but not defining. Kraft embodies a newer, far less heroic role that is nevertheless appropriate for an increasingly cynical world. He is the transactional billionaire, cynical possessor of fluid standards and dubious associations who may sometimes stand for something, but in the end, like so many of the rest, fell once again for Trump.Howard Bryant’s latest book is Kings and Pawns: Jackie Robinson and Paul Robeson in America from Mariner Books.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsNew England PatriotsSuper BowlDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

When he runs the country, he says, he will cut child benefit for those with more than two children and switch the £3bn saved tokeep down the price of beer.The art of populism lies in headlines. It is about the way you tell it. Farage also says he would still give benefits to “British working families”, meaning about 3,700 households with two British-born parents who both work full-time. It seems a gratuitous discrimination. As for cutting VAT on pubs to 10%, it would apply not just to pubs but to the entire hospitality sector. It was for effect that he decided to make the announcement in a pub rather than McDonald’s.The truth is that no national tax is hypothecated, other than the BBC licence fee. Farage’s family benefits would be as likely to go to bombers as to beer. He just wished to show some glimmer of fiscal responsibility. But his choice of pubs for special mention is significant. The government’s handling ofBritain’s high streetsis causing devastation.Higher taxes on jobs and higher minimum wages, an end to rates relief and soaring energy bills have crippled small retail businesses. The assault on casual labour in theEmployment Rights Actis another impending black hole. On top of this is the previous government’s easing of change-of-use from pubs to housing. Hence a perfect storm for the old Bull and Bush. Britain haslost a quarterof its pubs since 2000 and they areclosing at a rateof one a day in England and Wales. It is a real tragedy.The role of the pub as a local hub, whether in town or country, is hard to exaggerate. It is unlike an ordinary shop or cafe. It is usually the most historic and well-known local building after the church. A pub’s walls can be a local museum. The bar is open to all adults, rich and poor, friend and foe, gregarious and lonely. It is somewhere they can meet, watch television or merely pass the time of day. For many old people it serves as a day centre. None of these uses appear on planning documents.The pub’s proprietor is often a well-known local character, his or her building a place of security and even refuge. Since Covid, pubs have been allowed to spill into the street, where they serve as a centre of neighbourhood activity. At my local pub in central London a bunch of morris dancers once turned up to perform outside. They caused chaos. It was great. A high street without a pub is dead.As such, these places are not just hospitality outlets but unique social institutions. Their future should be discussed in these terms. This is why Rachel Reeves’sattack on pubs– despite herminor U-turn– is an act of social debilitation. Farage was right to focus attention on them.The nearest parallel to the pub is the one-time status of the parish church. It too was a place of local resort and comfort. Its leadership signified communal continuity and cohesion. That is now rarely the case. Some churches still offer support to those in need of company. But they operate on the fringes of communities, compared with pubs. Since their buildings mostly cannot be demolished, it would at least be good if, sometime in the future, the pub and the church could marry. The church pub should become the architecture of a united community.The prime minister this week announced an£800m extensionto his £5bn Pride in Place scheme. This was allegedly aimed at boosting an ever-increasing number of “communities”, selected by Whitehall as locations in which Reform is alarmingly strong. Note how to get cash out of today’s Treasury. The communities secretary, Steve Reed, suggested local boards would have powers and cash compulsorily to purchase properties left empty too long in the hands of property companies. We await the first one.U-turn on pubs has not solved the government’s mess on business rates | Nils PratleyRead moreOne proposal is to turn ailing retail and hospitality sites intonot-for-profit social enterprises. This is one expanding sector of high-street activity, with some130,000 social enterprisesreportedly already up and running across Britain. The village shop in the Archers’ Ambridge is now such a business, as is the famousPlough pubin Fadmoor on the North York Moors. Every village should have a social enterprise, but it requires an active community to operate it, not just one feared by Labour as pro-Reform.When Starmer came to power he pledged, as does every incoming prime minister, to devolve power by giving it back to communities across the UK. They would have “a right torequest more powers”. Like every prime minister, he then did the opposite. He stripped local communities of virtually their last true area of discretion, over local housing and planning. It was an act of ultimate centralism.If Starmer now means to U-turn on this, so well and good. He might help by relieving high streets of the looming bureaucracy of his new employment act. He either means what he says or he is just descending to Farage’s level. The communities in which both are taking an interest are having the blood drained from their veins.The blood is that of local institutions that bring people together, that serve other purposes than those of money. One of them is the pub.

The animal kingdom could give us some cluesElle HuntAs fewer people choose to pair up, let alone marry, it could be that our species’ mating patterns are moving closer to the natural orderThu 5 Feb 2026 10.29 ESTLast modified on Thu 5 Feb 2026 13.31 ESTShareMonogamy, you may have heard, is in crisis.Fewer people are in relationships, let alone opting to be in one’til death. And even those who have already exchanged vows seem to be increasingly looking for wiggle room. “Quiet divorce” – mentally checking out of your union, rather than going through the rigmarole of formally dissolving it – isreportedly on the rise, as is “ethical non-monogamy” (ENM) and opening up a relationship to include other partners.This is borne out by my experience on mainstream dating apps. About one profile in every 10 I come across seems to express a preference for “ENM” or polyamory, or mentions an existing wife or girlfriend. The best you can hope for, if you’re prepared to accept those terms, is that the “primary partner” really is across the arrangement as described.From Lily Allen’sheadline-grabbing albumspilling the gory details of how her glitzy marriage came undone, to Haim’s Relationships, a song that expresses fretful ambivalence about the mere concept of monogamy itself, pop culture narratives seem to be just as cynical about our capacity to commit to one person. No wonder it is hard to feel optimistic about monogamy.A survey in May last yearof 1,000 Britons found that nearly a third (31%) believed monogamy was no longer a “realistic” ideal; among 18- to 24-year-olds, that rose to 42%. A larger pollin 2023 by YouGovfound respondents were nearly exactly split on whether humans were “naturally monogamous” or not (with nearly a third not being sure).For conservatives, of course, all this is deeply troubling, and evidence of the erosion of good Christian values and the traditional family unit. But what if this uneasy reckoning with monogamy is not society acting out against the natural order, but moving us closer in line with it?Late last year,a studyfrom the University of Cambridge shed light on how humans’ tendency towards monogamous pairings compared to that of other mammals. This “monogamy league table”, ranking the proportion of half and full-siblings in 35 species, put us comfortably in the top 10 – but not at No 1.In fact humans ranked below African wild dogs, moustached tamarins and Eurasian beavers, and with a “monogamy rate” just above that of white-handed gibbons and meerkats. Placed bottom of the species studied was the Scottish Soay sheep, reflecting each ewe’s mating with several rams; at the top was the California deermouse, which, once mated, stays paired for life.So what does this tell us? That we should be looking to beavers for secrets to a happy, lasting marriage? That traditionalists should take up the California deermouse as a mascot for monogamy (it is admittedly quite cute)? Or that efforts to loosen the marital tie, “ethically” or otherwise, are at odds with our species’ essential nature?Though the study establishes monogamy as “the dominant mating pattern for our species”, its takeaways for us are of course limited,as acknowledged by its authorDr Mark Dyble, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of Cambridge. It measures reproductive monogamy, that is, whether an animal procreates with multiple partners, because “in most mammals, mating and reproduction are tightly linked”. But humans haven’t been so bound for a long time, especially since the development of birth control.Unlike other animals, complex cultural norms have always influenced our approach to sexual and romantic pairings. Marriage itself – a relatively recent institution in our species’ 300,000-year-long history, thought to beroughly 4,300 years old– served to bind women to men (for a long time as property), ensure paternity and protect the male line.Christianity began to become involved from the eighth century, and then the state added more layers of baggage, regulating interpersonal unions in order to govern property and inheritance.Monogamy (reproductive or otherwise) has never been guaranteed through any of these permutations of pair-bonding. It certainly hasn’t always been uniformly expected: women have historically faced greater social and personal repercussionsfor infidelitythan men.And to focus only on the western approach to pairing and reproduction actually elides huge diversity among humans. Only a minority of societies globally (a reported 17%) are strictly monogamous, according to a 2013 study. As a species we have come up with a range of potential approaches to partnership, “from serial monogamy to stable polygamy”, as Dyble notes in the Cambridge study, and within all of them created conditions for committed parenting.This is all the more remarkable in comparison with our primate relatives. Mountain gorillas and chimpanzees rank very low in the “monogamy league table”, instead living in non-monogamous groups. Yet our own preference for monogamy is likely to have developed on from that arrangement.Viewed in this context, the recent second-guessing of monogamy seems less like an affront to our nature, or a threat to our societies, and more like another step in our evolution. Not only has it always tolerated different kinds of pairings; it has always been in flux, negotiated not just between individuals but in line with our society and times. Indeed, given the tremendous baggage we’ve wrapped up with our “mating system”, it’s somewhat remarkable that it’s proved so load-bearing yet so flexible.We may be nothing but mammals, but the Cambridge study is a timely reminder of the diversity not just between species but within them. The state or health of monogamy can’t be assessed separate from the effects of politics, religion, culture, economics and – lately, increasingly – technology.As such, it will continue to evolve. Perhaps it’s no wonder the California deermouse manages to mate for life: its average life expectancy in the wild is less than two years.Elle Hunt is a freelance journalistExplore more on these topicsEvolutionOpinionAnimalsMarriageBiologyFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

This was a surprise for two reasons: I’m chronically online so I usually see everything first, and also there are no good news stories any more in this life. But it was real, and for many people, including me, this one piece of blessed news was equal to three or four regular pieces of good news.It is a rat king of good news, a fatberg of good news clogging up my pipes. It had beenannounced that*trumpets heralding**doves released*the iconic Nigella Lawson is joining the iconic The Great British Bake Off!!!!!! (I don’t know how many exclamation marks are allowed in the Guardian style guide, I might be pushing it.)Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsMy reaction might seem over the top, but I won’t allow you to Debbie Downer this news that has turned my frown upside down. One of my favourite people on the planet to watch on TV, joining a TV show I love and watch every season of. As a TV lover, nothing could be better. Bake Off is a wonderful, cosy, sweet, fun and delicious show. Unlike other reality competition shows (which I also love), the contestants on the showarethere to make friends. I’ve enjoyed Prue Leith’s reign on the show, she is an experienced and polite woman, but I am filled with delighted anticipation about what the new season will look like with the addition of the eponymous Nigella.Changes to judging lineups are inevitable in long-running reality shows, and the shift in dynamic can sometimes cause issues, but in this case I feel as chill as puff pastry between laminations. The show has already been through several host and judge shake-ups over the last few years, and the previous change was one of the best, replacing Matt Lucas (I used to shut one eye and try to pretend he wasn’t there) with the delightful Alison Hammond. Alison is a hilarious presence who also says “bake” like “BIYKE”, forcing you to repeat it in your own home every time. I respect Prue, but I can’t wait to see how Alison and Nigella vibe. I think, like Alison, Nigella will be an extremely warm presence, which will work well with Paul Hollywood’s statue-like husky-eyed, semi-evil demeanour. I suspect we may see a slight rise in double entendres, but if anyone disrespects Nigella, they will be facing the wrath of a global audience. Just because we like watching sweet baking shows doesn’t mean we can’t get revenge.Vertigo has turned my world upside down. But knowing there are famous people suffering steadies me | Rebecca ShawRead moreI was curious about whether Nigella would bring the cosy and intimate vibe she is most known for, or if she would switch it up for the show and become a stringent judge. Then Iread thisinterview:“I’m not someone who looks for fault, I look for pleasure,” she said, positioning herself as the counterbalance to Hollywood’s famously technical lens. “I’m all about the eating,”she added.Thank God. Actually, this is the only area I can see Nigella causing an issue. The tent they bake in is not temperature controlled, which can cause big issues with baking and also with English people, who aren’t able to cope above 25C. Everyone is already sweaty and stressed, and thenNigella Lawsonappears? To judge you? I’d be afraid of becoming incapacitated. I know there are already a lot of shows to watch Nigella do her thing, but I’m most looking forward to watching her interact with the contestants.Bake Off is quite often a really diverse show, especially compared with scripted television. It’s hard to predict who will be more obsessed with her – the queer women? The gay men? The underappreciated mothers? The straight lads with a heart of gold? The straight dads with a heart of gold? Nigella is funny, charming, warm, smart and beautiful. She is relaxed with all sorts of people, seems down to earth, and her dynamic with each of the unique individuals on the show will be a really fun part of the viewing experience.The decision to hire her makes complete sense. She has the skills, the temperament, the fans. In my mind, she should already be spending her life where random people just prepare delicious things for her to have bites of. If she was carried around the tent on a palanquin by big strong men and fed peeled grapes as a palate cleanser between each tasting, that would also feel completely right to me. It’s got all the ingredients for a perfectly baked show.It might not seem like much, but more and more we have to celebrate the small wins, the nice things, the things we can look forward to. In these grim and bleak times, I can picture a future of Nigella eating things with a little fork in the Bake Off tent, and that’s enough to keep me going.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsThe Great British Bake OffOpinionNigella LawsonFood TVTelevisionReality TVcommentShareReuse this content"

Start thinking like a developing countryLarry ElliottSince the 70s, China has turned around its economy – from introducing subsidies to mining untapped talent, these are the lessons Starmer must take note ofThu 5 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 5 Feb 2026 13.33 ESTShareMargaret Thatcher and Deng Xiaoping were both on a mission when they came to power within months of each other at the tail end of the 1970s. Thatcher wanted to reinvigorate capitalism in Britain, while Deng launched a programme of reform and liberalisation that he calledsocialism with Chinese characteristics.Since then, the economies of Britain andChinahave been transformed, but in different ways. China was essentially a peasant economy when Deng took control, but it has since become an industrial powerhouse, while Britain has ceased to be a major manufacturing player and instead became a country dominated by services.As Keir Starmer may have noticed on hisvisit to Chinalast week, somewhere along the way the two countries have swapped places. In the early days of Deng’s reforms, there was a concentration on mass-produced goods where China’s much lower labour costs gave it a competitive edge. That is no longer the case, with China the dominantproducer of electric vehiclesand vying with the US in artificial intelligence.To be sure, there are many good things about Britain, just as there are many bad things about China. Yet if the comparison between China’s manufacturing prowess and the service-sector dominated British economy makes Starmer uncomfortable, then so it should. China is what a country that still cares about making stuff looks like.The prime minister’s trip to China has quickly been overshadowed by the latest revelations about Peter Mandelson, yet there are threeimportant lessonsfrom the visit. The first is that manufacturing matters. Britain will not prosper again without rebuilding its productive base. The alternative to a strong and thriving manufacturing sector is not an economy dominated by highly paid “knowledge workers”, but a low-tech service sector in which finance dominates.Services now account for about80% of the British economy, 10 times the size of manufacturing. Yet it is much harder to improve the efficiency of a labour-intensive service-sector job than it is a job in a factory. Britain’s weak productivity performance since the financial crisis of 2008 should not really come as that much of a surprise.The essence of Thatcherism was that market forces should determine which businesses thrived. If Britain excelled in financial and business services, then so be it. That’s what the country should concentrate its efforts on, while other nations made the ships and the machine tools. Yet services are not separate from the productive side of the economy; rather they depend on machinery, transport systems, data infrastructure and energy systems. If a country doesn’t manufacture these things, then it has to import them, which is precisely what Britain does. Exports of services do not compensate for atrade deficit in goodsthat has persisted since the early 1980s. What’s more, the dangers of an over-reliance on imported manufactured goods were brutally exposed during the pandemic of 2020 as global supply chains froze up.The second lesson is that, despite the dismal record of the past 50 years, it is not too late to rebuild Britain’s industrial base. This is a rich country with abundant reserves of untapped talent. Denmark’s successfulwind-turbine sectorshows that small, rich western countries can still enjoy industrial success. It is over-pessimistic to assume that the manufacturing ship has sailed and that the best Britain can do is rely on the City and the few remaining pockets of industry, such as pharmaceuticals.The final lesson from Starmer’s visit to China is that rejuvenating the manufacturing sector will require a colossal effort. Clearly, Britain is never going to be the workshop of the world again – as it was in the 19th century – but even the more modest target of raising manufacturing’s share of the economy from 8% to 10% of gross domestic product would be no mean feat. Industrial strategies designed with that in mind have come and gone with depressing regularity.The Guardian view on high-street decline: a symbol of failure in a discontented nation | EditorialRead moreCharting a course and sticking to it for longer than a couple of years matters. A dedicated economic ministry with the power to face down the bean counters in the Treasury would help greatly, because investment – public and private – will be vital. Any industrial strategy will struggle unless the right foundations are put in place, so it is hard to see how manufacturing can be rebuilt without a thriving domestic steel sector.Problems are immediately apparent. Even if the UK puts serious effort into building industrial capacity, won’t the new factories face being strangled at birth by already well-established overseas competitors? How, for example, could a UK company making electric vehicles prevent itself being undercut by cheaper Chinese models?The answer is that there is no way of preventing such an outcome without active steps being taken by the government. This could involve stipulating a domestic component for goods sold in Britain. It could involve a “buy British” procurement policy. It could mean subsidies and tax credits for UK manufacturing plants of the sortJoe Biden introducedin the US. There is a whole range of measures – from tax to tariffs – that developing countries regularly use to protect their infant industries as they find their feet.Despite becoming the world’s second biggest economy, China still picks winners and has strict controls on capital. If Britain is ever to emerge from its post-industrial decline, the same approach would not go amiss. The bottom line is that to rebuild manufacturing Britain has to see the world through the prism of a developing country not a developed one.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsManufacturing sectorOpinionServices sectorEconomic policyChinacommentShareReuse this content"

And now, as Friday’s sky turns indigo, I’m calling about reports from Lewisham, southLondon, that tomorrow they’re expecting a flood of 500 Green activists. This comes as a surprise to the party’s own news machine.“Are you sure?”My figures turn out to be wrong. It’s nearer 600.On a dreary Saturday morning, they stream in from all over London, hare along Kent’s A-roads, pour off Suffolk and Surrey trains, to converge on this primary school. It’s the largest venue the volunteers could hire and the corridors, the loos, even the little library with its impressive range ofJulia Donaldsons, are all heaving with grownups.We cram into the assembly hall, where the crowd is declared as the biggest turnout in Green history. The sole exception, I find later, is polling day of the last general election; yet today’s draw is not some short, sharp fight for Westminster, but a campaign for the council, where ballots are months away. In normal times, this stuff is about as pedestrian as politics gets, drawing a handful or two of diehards to trudge door to door, begging old customers to put their X in the usual spot.Yet the size of today’s crowd tells you these aren’t normal times. This winter is a hinge moment in British politics, the point at which the default choice of leftwing voters is no longerLabour. In Wales, it will be Plaid Cymru; in Scotland, the SNP. And in this corner of inner London, as in many English cities, it will be the Greens.For this position, the party owes much to its opponents, among them Jeremy Corbyn, Zarah Sultana and their genius advisers for so swiftly turningYour Partyinto a sparsely attended wake. But its biggest bouquet must go to Keir Starmer’s Labour.Look up “one-party state” in a political dictionary and alongside Pyongyang there will feature Lewisham. At the last council elections in 2022, Labour scooped every single seat, plus the mayoralty. The localGreen party, on the other hand, shrank so drastically it came close to shutting down.Then: lift-off. Lewisham began 2025 with about 500 Green party members; by autumn, almost as many were signing up in just one week. At the start of 2026, the local party stands at about 2,500, putting it just behind the Green “fortress” of Hackney. At the school’s entrance I meet Ed, whose job it is to call up local newbies and welcome them to the party. Last January, the task was his alone. Today, he heads a team of nearly 25.View image in fullscreenGreen party supporters at the event in Lewisham.Photograph: Tim Jules Hull/The Guardian“Six months ago, I wouldn’t have believed we could fight Lewisham,” says the Green party CEO, Harriet Lamb, sipping tea in the hall and looking around with undisguised astonishment. “Now I look across Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle and I think: this is a social movement.”From the stage booms another announcement: later in the day,Zack Polanskiwill address volunteers. Ah, Zack. In Westminster, they are wowed by the Greens’ new leader, who is energetic, likable and fluent enough in the media to trouble Nigel Farage. Yet what’s striking today is how little activists or potential voters talk about Polanski.Drop his name and praise flows, but ask why they’ve gone Green and you hear condemnation of the Labour party. Lamb was a Labour member; Lewisham’s two Green councillorsdefected from Labour, claiming they were “bullied out” for opposing the brutal destruction of Gaza. And every single non-white voter names Palestine as the reason they can no longer back Labour.While SW1 theorises that the Green surge is down to Polanski, SE4 reality says it’s 99% Starmer.One resident comes to the door having just read about Shabana Mahmood giving the police facial recognition technology. “As a black man, I don’t feel safe.” A dad pushing a pram talks of how the Labour council has approved a giant block of flats to go up at Lewisham market, of which only a fraction will be for social rent. “They ought to be doing more for the common man.”I am recounting conversations from just before the latest Epstein file releases, which can only sharpen that sense of disconnect. Because what they show is how at the height of the banking crisis, with Wall Street and the City on public-sector life support, the class of financiers who brought about this disaster were eyeing up billion-dollar deals and fresh assets, whether superyachts or young women. While the rest of us headed into years of immiseration, the filthy rich carried on regardless – and they did so with the willing aid of the centre-left elite, whetherPeter Mandelsonor theFrench Socialistsor the US Democrats.In these semi-detached houses, with freshly painted doors and big burglar alarms and new shutter blinds, voters don’t kvetch about rising prices. Instead, they spurn Labour’s values. For all that our prime minister claims Harold Wilson as an inspiration, he has roundly ignored his hero’s maxim that Labour is “a moral crusade or it is nothing”.All this is a gift for Polanski, and a potential headache. He heads a party that was fringe, yet can now claim to be mainstream. At the same time, many if not most of his members are embarking on their second political marriage after Corbyn. Every second marriage is a triumph of hope over experience, of trusting the new guy won’t let you down, while on alert for all the warning signs. The optimism of these activists is duly tempered.One prospective councillor warns of the dangers of “building a project around just one guy”. A campaigner estimates that he has sunk a week of unpaid work into simply pulling off today’s meeting. Yet another notes: “We have an infrastructure for a party of 50,000 members when we’ll soon be at 200,000. It’s not sustainable.”An hour after getting off the Pendolino from Manchester, Polanski pitches up. When I voice his members’ criticisms, he accepts them all. “It’s like being a startup that’s been around a long time, but suddenly we’re really getting going,” he says. “We’re having to run and catch the ball at the same time.”While he spent the first few months of his leadership making a noise, getting the attention of journalists and voters and donors, he will now focus more on policy. Last night, he spoke withJoseph Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate in economics and campaigner against inequality. Next month, he’ll set out his platform on tax and spend. The big question is how he will find the time and space to do all this, when there are so many audiences for whom he needs to perform. In Gorton, he says, he had five lapel mics pinned to him at all times. He could not even go to the loo in peace.But now he has to gee up the troops and make a speech, while running on empty. He heads towards the assembly hall, where a great mass of expectation awaits.A video shows what happens next: he bounds on to the little stage, looks out over the wall of bodies. As he takes in the crowd, his eyes grow wide.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGreen partyOpinionZack PolanskiLabourKeir StarmerLondoncommentShareReuse this content"

My father taught that nonviolence begins with language and the discipline to choose words that uplift rather than degrade, that clarify rather than distort and that build community rather than fracture it.Last month in the United States, we markedthe holiday that bears his nameat a time when our own social cohesion is under immense strain. The rhetoric of public life has grown sharper, more cynical and more divisive. Too often, we speak as if our neighbours are adversaries rather than fellow citizens. But this erosion of respect is not unique to America. It is a global challenge and Australia is not exempt.Sadness, fear and mistrust in Perth’s Indigenous community after Invasion Day bomb scare: ‘It’s really heavy for our mob over here’Read moreDuring my Australian visit, I have sensed both the extraordinary achievements and future potential of this nation along with the fragility of its social fabric. As I see in so many communities across the world, there are deep wounds and deeper misunderstandings. But what I also observe is the power of narrative. The stories we tell about one another, and the stories we showcase, shape the possibilities of our shared future.When we speak about groups of people as problems rather than partners, we diminish our collective humanity. Reducing individuals to stereotypes or statistics closes the door to empathy and allowing fear-based narratives to prevail weakens the bonds that hold us together.Australia is at a moment when it is wrestling with the impact of language and division and the realisation that the choice of language matters profoundly.While these concerns apply across all of society, it is in the nation’s relationship with its First Peoples that has been the focus of my trip to Sydney this week, and further illustrated for me the importance of language, respect and narrative.In every conversation about emerging First Nations talent, about pathways to full economic participation, and about the link between economic and social justice, I have been reminded that language is not an accessory to progress, it is its foundation. The stories a nation chooses to tell aboutIndigenous Australiansdo more than shape public opinion; they shape opportunity, belonging and the character of the country itself.So often, Indigenous Australians have been spoken about primarily through the lens of deficit: disadvantage, disparity, dysfunction. These realities must be confronted honestly but they are not the whole story.View image in fullscreenMartin Luther King III.Photograph: Flashpoint LabsThe equally important story is one of resilience, brilliance, creativity and leadership. It is the story of young people applying their talent and tenacity to succeed. A story of communities that carry deep wisdom about land, kinship and stewardship and have so much to teach the world.During my time in Sydney, I have had the privilege of meeting First Nations university students through the CareerTrackers Indigenous internship program. These young people are not defined by deficit but by excellence and aspiration. They are engineers, scientists, lawyers, designers and entrepreneurs in the making and they are rewriting the narrative.History shows that when a society changes its story about who belongs and who can lead, collective ambition expands. In the US, when public celebration of Black Excellence challenged entrenched limits, we widened the nation’s sense of what is possible.Much of my family’s work is centred on the belief that respect is not passive. It is a practice and not merely the absence of insult. We must find the courage to confront injustice without dehumanising those who disagree and the discipline to choose words that reflect our highest values rather than our lowest impulses.In America we are learning, sometimes painfully, what happens when respect erodes. Polarisation deepens, collapsing trust and weakening our democracy. Australia must not wait for such fractures to widen before taking action.The work of strengthening social cohesion begins with a commitment to responsible language and civility that goes beyond legislation. It must be modelled by leaders, reinforced by institutions and practised by all.With The Rainbow Serpent, Dick Roughsey shared the spirit of our country. His work is a gift to us all | Alexis WrightRead moreThat future will require speaking about Indigenous Australians, indeed all community groups, with the respect their cultures and contributions deserve. Elevating stories of achievement, like those I’ve witnessed this week and rejecting narratives that rely on fear or dehumanisation.My father believed in the Beloved Community, a society where differences are not erased but embraced, where justice is pursued without violence, and where dignity is afforded to every person. That vision is not an American dream; it is a human one.Australia has the opportunity to bring that vision closer to reality. But it begins with language and respect. It begins with the stories you choose to tell about one another.Martin Luther KingIII is a globally respected humanitarian and civil rights leader. As the oldest son of the late Dr Martin Luther King Jr and his wife, Coretta Scott King, King has devoted his life to promoting global human rights, consulting with heads of state, governments and NGOs. He has delivered keynote addresses on justice and inclusion at major institutions including the United Nations, the World Economic Forum and the Nobel Peace Laureates Summit.

Frozen (2013)Pathetic fallacy is the literary device in which the environment reflects a character’s mood. It is central to Disney’s animated classic, which is about a woman who gets so annoyed that she literally turns her surroundings into a perpetual winter. As such, she is responsible for untold miseries, not least the fact that her stroppiness directly caused the invention of Josh Gad’s annoying snowman.19. The Shining (1980)Perhaps the defining movie on seasonal affective disorder. In The Shining, Jack Nicholson’s family suffer as he succumbs to the madness of snowbound isolation. Although the interior scenes are what really give the film its terrifying reputation, it’s worth remembering that none of the events would occur if the Overlook Hotel was easy to escape. Also a timely reminder that snow really takes the fun out of mazes.18. Blade Runner (1982)Ridley Scott’s classic is a masterpiece of design, with its rain-drenched futuristic cityscapes playing as much of a role as any of the actual characters. Does the constant rain affect the plot? No, not really, although you’d have to imagine that everyone would be a lot less grimly miserable if the sun came out now and again.17. Force Majeure (2014)View image in fullscreenThe life-changing avalanche in Force Majeure.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyRemade in 2020 as Downhill, Ruben Östlund’s Force Majeure is more about how people react to perceived weather than the weather itself. It follows the repercussions for a man who, upon believing that an avalanche is about to hit, abandons his family and runs away. Everything is immediately undone, and what follows is excruciatingly hard to watch.16. The Thing (1982)Ultimately weather isn’t the first thing you think about when you think about The Thing, because that would be the thing itself in all its nightmarishly grotesque glory. However, try to imagine the film in a lovely springtime meadow and it instantly loses all its power. Its Antarctic setting means that all the characters are isolated and visibility is constantly low. This is what makes the film such a claustrophobic classic.15. Hard Rain (1998)A notorious flop upon release, Hard Rain is a film where a criminal gang attempts to conduct a heist, only to be outdone by – you guessed it – some pretty hard rain. The film tries so hard to be serious that it eventually becomes enjoyably silly, although Morgan Freeman is miscast as a baddie and Minnie Driver complained that she wasn’t allowed to wear a wetsuit because the producers wanted her nipples to be visible.14. Everest (2015)Although it has now essentially become a theme park for the rich and reckless, it’s important to remember that multiple people die on Mount Everest every year. Everest – an all-star Poseidon Adventure-style ensemble piece – tells the story of a real life disaster that befell climbers in 1996, when eight were caught in a blizzard and died during their descent. The film does a good job of showing how unsurvivable conditions are there. Indeed, just five months before the film was released, 22 people were killed when the mountain was struck by an avalanche.13. Take Shelter (2011)Few partnerships in film are as satisfying as the one between Jeff Nichols and Michael Shannon. Take Shelter is a perfect example. Shannon plays a man plagued with visions of terrible storms. Are they premonitions or is he mentally ill? It’s a premise that allows both parties to work to their strengths; Shannon is tortured and haunting, and the amount of psychological tension that the writer-director Nichols can wring from the story is astonishing.12. Into the Wild (2007)Sean Penn’s retelling of the story of Christopher McCandless, a young man who ventured unprepared into Alaska, has long inspired a small army of copyists, many of whom end up having to be rescued. Which makes you wonder what film they were watching, since Into the Wild is a tale of a man showing up unprepared for all manner of storms, floods and ice. It’s beautifully done, but probably better to just stay at home.11. The Impossible (2012)Those who remember the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami will long be haunted by the news footage of its aftermath, with bodies piled up outside hospitals. The Impossible is a dramatisation of that event. And while not universally well received upon release – it was just eight years after the disaster, and since its stars were Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts, some accused it of whitewashing what really happened – it remains a profoundly upsetting watch.10. The Revenant (2015)View image in fullscreenLeonardo DiCaprio in his Oscar-winning performance.Photograph: APBack in 2015, Leonardo DiCaprio was so desperate for an Oscar that he ended up subjecting himself to The Revenant, a film where an endless litany of awful things happen to his character. And while it does get a bit slapstick at times – occasionally veering into Mr Bean cosplay territory – he does end up being relentlessly clobbered by the weather. There are storms. There is rain. It gets so cold that his beard freezes. It is all tremendously unpleasant but it did the job, proving that nothing gets you an Oscar faster than a bit of inclement weather.9. Twister (1996)Twister – and to a lesser extent its recent sequel Twisters – speaks to a deeply American fascination with storms. Where other films paint tornadoes as things to hide from at all costs, Twister turns them into a spectacle. All the characters here are determined to chase them no matter what, whooping and hollering as they go. It respects the severity of storms, which demolish houses and vehicles, but is such a mid-90s blockbuster that only bad guys and side characters die. It is a good tornado movie, but is it the best tornado movie? No, and that’s thanks to …8. Sharknado (2013)Because, while Twister is fun, it has to lose points for the tornadoes not being stuffed to the gills with legions of murderous sharks. This is not an accusation you can level at Sharknado, which is explicitly a film about a tornado stuffed with murderous sharks. Made on the cheap, in order to maximise on the ridiculous trend for knock-off creature features that began with Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus, Sharknado is deliberately extremely preposterous from start to finish. While it deserves to be watched, the same probably cannot be said about all its sequels, especially the one starring Jedward.7. Magnolia (1999)Paul Thomas Anderson’s film is the director’s attempt to process his father’s death, but it is so ambitious and sprawling that it essentially ends up being about everything. This includes freak weather events. The film’s emotional climax comes in the form of millions of frogs falling from the sky. At first it is absurd. Then, as the frogs hammer down, breaking windows and causing car crashes, it becomes terrifying, then upsetting, then awe-inspiring. It is also much more of a logistical nightmare than many of the films in this list, since it is much harder to mop up a citywide ankle-deep deluge of frogs than it is some snow.6. The Day After Tomorrow (2004)It would be astonishingly easy to fill this entire list with films made by Roland Emmerich, a man who has dedicated his entire career to making films where loads of people get punished by incredibly crap weather. However, The Day After Tomorrow is perhaps the best microcosm of his oeuvre. There’s a hailstorm. There’s a hurricane. There’s wind and rain. There’s the sudden appearance of a new ice age. There’s a pack of loose wolves, which isn’t traditionally meteorological but deserves mention. It is Emmerich’s climate crisis movie; a grand warning that, unless we change our ways, we’re going to either freeze to death or get eaten by wolves.5. The Poseidon Adventure (1972)Fair warning: from this point onwards, the list starts to skew heavily towards people having a rubbish time on a boat. And with this in mind, it would be wrong to ignore the ur-text of people having a rubbish time on a boat. A film about a luxury cruise liner being undone by a tsunami, it features a murderer’s row of performers, including Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Carol Lynley and Roddy McDowall. The disaster movie that other disaster movies aspire to be, it was the highest-grossing movie of 1973 and won two Oscars. Bit weird to describe a film about mass death as an adventure, though.4. Noah (2014)View image in fullscreenNoah.Photograph: Paramount /Sportsphoto/AllstarDarren Aronofsky has made a career of depicting terrible things happening to people, so it stands to reason that he would eventually make a film about an incredibly terrible thing that happened to everyone at once. Noah, his retelling of the story of Noah’s Ark, is his highest-grossing film to date, but also possibly his least well remembered. Did you know Ray Winstone is in it? Did you know Emma Watson is in it? Did you know that several countries banned it on religious grounds? Either way, you have to agree that it is a film about some absolutely dreadful weather.3. The Mist (2007)This will be contentious because, when it comes to films about droplets of water that are suspended in air, some people get absolutely furious. In one corner there are fans of John Carpenter’s The Fog (about some spooky things hiding in some fog), and in the other are fans of Frank Darabont’s The Mist (about some spooky things hiding in some mist). There is only room for one of these on this list and, for me, The Mist just about edges it. This is partly because it’s based on a Stephen King novel, and partly because it has one of the most hilariously overwrought endings of any film in history. I welcome your emails.2. The Perfect Storm (2000)You know a film has hit a nerve when it becomes part of the lexicon. We live in an age where almost everything is described as a perfect storm, and it’s all because of this film: a story of some fishermen off the Massachusetts coast who found themselves tragically caught up in a nightmarish combination of high pressure, a cold front and a hurricane. It’s a good film, with strong performances by George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg, but the knowledge that this really happened (in 1991) makes it all the more heartbreaking.1. All Is Lost (2013)What a thing of beauty this is. The only actor in All Is Lost isRobert Redford, and only 51 words are spoken aloud in the entire film. All Is Lost is the story of a sailor who realises that there is a hole in his boat, with a storm approaching. The boat flips. He’s thrown overboard. He gets in a raft. There’s another storm. Things do not altogether go great. It might just be Redford’s best film, his face gradually transforming into a gritty monument of stoicism as he quietly accepts his fate. It might not be a perfect storm, but it’s a perfect film.Explore more on these topicsRankedRobert RedfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cardiff’s National Museum has put together a superb, daunting retrospective of the woman who is now, perhaps, the most famous Welsh artist. It is not a blow-by-blow biographical story of how she was born in Haverfordwest in 1876, how she and her brother Augustus both loved art as children, how she insisted on going to the Slade School of FineArtlike him then made her life in bohemian France. Instead, the moment you enter the show, you are plunged into her spiritual, austere existence. We meet her in the glory of her solitude, painting cats and the sparse rooms she rented in Paris and women alone in moments of calm thought.There is a row of variants of a young woman in a blue dress with long dark hair sitting weakly in an armchair, a table at her elbow, all painted in about 1920. In most there’s a cup and teapot on the table, in one it’s a bowl of soup. She looks down as she reads a letter, occasionally a book. Their titles vary too – The Letter, The Seated Woman, The Convalescent.Their brilliance lies in what they don’t show. There are no hats covered with fruit, no chatting crowds, no omnibus, none of the anecdotal details other British artists of her generation tended to get distracted by. John cuts out the social flab and paints the essence of inner experience, the woman’s sorrow, illness, despair, recovery as she sips and reads.View image in fullscreenBattered by life … Portrait of Mrs Atkinson, 1898.Photograph: AlamyIt took enormous intelligence and decisiveness to paint so purely. Her earliest works are hardly more crowded than her maturest ones. Mrs Atkinson, painted in about 1898, sits in Victorian black, her elderly face battered by life, her eyes unsmiling, the precise details of hearth and wallpaper behind her underlining the bleak truth. Portraits of John’s friend Dorelia on their first trip together to France are already pared down, purified, mystical. John has begun her great renunciation. She will only paint what is essential.Not that she’s an artist without passion or desire. She was more than a little in love with Dorelia, whom she portrays in a warm golden lamp glow at night in Toulouse. When John stayed on in Paris, getting work as a nude artist’s model including in the studio of Auguste Rodin, she started an affair with the already world-famous pioneer of modern sculpture. Her study of Rodin’s leonine face is here. So is Rodin’s portrait of her, a bronze head craggily textured by inner turmoil. He didn’t just look at her body after all.View image in fullscreenThe glory of solitude … Seated Tortoiseshell Cat.Photograph: Robin Maggs/By permission of Amgueddfa Cymru – Museum WalesFor an artist interested in stripping reality to basics, it made sense to dispense with clothes. She may have been a child of VictorianWalesbut she saw nudity as natural. The two versions of her Self-Portrait, Nude, Sketching, from about 1908-9, use brownish paper and in one case white gouache like Rodin’s drawings, but here the nude is the artist. John is cool and unabashed as she stands naked with sketchbook in hand, studying herself in a mirror.She has the same drive to escape the repressive, claustrophobic dishonesty of the world she was born into that drove male modernists of her time – Rodin but also Matisse, Klimt, Schiele. Clothes symbolise social trappings, hierarchies, lies that define and oppress. Better to be free and truthful, if a little chilly in an unheated Paris room. Yet in her search for a simplicity beyond social fuss, John was also attracted to the opposite, represented in a stunning row of portraits of nuns, their faces framed by white triangular headdresses.View image in fullscreenThe only smile in the show … Mère Poussepin Seated at a Table, 1913-1920.Photograph: By permission of Amgueddfa Cymru – Museum WalesThese nuns were members of a Catholic religious community at Meudon, in the Paris suburbs, where John moved in 1911. She converted to Catholicism and was keen to serve the church artistically. Her nuns are paradoxically individualist: each woman comes across as characterful and unique inside her religious uniform. One, based on a print of the community’s 17th-century founder Mother Marie Poussepin, even smiles – the only smile in the show.John’s mysticism doesn’t stop at nuns. The blue her young women wear so often is, in Christian art, the colour of purity and heaven. In The Pilgrim, a woman sits meditatively in a huge blue cape as if ready to set out on a sacred quest that will be hard, lonely, necessary.In 1935 she wrote from Meudon to a curator at this museum after it bought its first work by her. “I am very happy and honoured that you have bought one of my little paintings for the museum,” she says in a note that is framed here. And they truly are “little”. This is an exhibition of small pictures in pale colours, so subtle they are almost spectral, a misty gathering of silent women in small rooms and long-dead cats. But in its emotional power, the art of Gwen John is enormous, heavy, even crushing. Wales does full justice to its great modern artist.Gwen John: Strange Beauties is atNational Museum, Cardiff, from 7 February to 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingWalesreviewsShareReuse this content"

She is the silent but terrifying snake-headed Medusa, and one of the surprises in an exhibition at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam revolving around Greek and Roman myths.View image in fullscreenForce of nature … room inspired by Leda and the Swan in the Metamorphoses exhibition.Photograph: Albertine Dijkema/RijksmuseumWhile the show features rarely lent works from masters such as Caravaggio, Bernini, Rodin and Brâncuși, it marries them with modern artists who reinterpret the legends where male gods do all they can to get their wicked way and the powerless are punished. Transgender bodies, bare breasts and even a volcanic vulva appear in artworks inspired by Roman poet Ovid’s masterpiece, Metamorphoses.Taco Dibbits, general director of the Rijksmuseum, believes the 200 myths and legends from this ancient epic poem still speak to our uncertain times. “The Metamorphoses have inspired artists for over 2,000 years and the subject is very relevant today, when everything is changing,” he says. “Things are morphed into other forms. People morph into other people. It’s about the force of nature and giving an explanation to our passions, to our sadness, to our fears. That’s what makes it so intensely human.”The show features plaster models by Auguste Rodin, with figures emerging from crude rock like the female sculpture created by Pygmalion in Ovid’s legend, who comes to life. There is a room inspired by Leda and the Swan, with Zeus “seducing” the Spartan queen by taking the bird’s form.It also includes a rare loan from the Louvre. Gian Lorenzo Bernini’s 17th-century carving of Sleeping Hermaphroditus – which sets an ancient Roman sculpture of a hermaphrodite with male and female sexual organs on a lifelike marble mattress – was inspired by Ovid’s story of a couple’s bodies merging in sexual union.There are some uncomfortable outcomes for women in the tales. Jupiter assumes the form of a cloud or shower of gold to impregnate his female target. As one explanatory board admits: “His loves are rarely tender – more often coercive and one-sided.”View image in fullscreenFluid gender … Gian Lorenzo Bernini’s 17th-century carving of Sleeping Hermaphroditus.Photograph: Amie Galbraith/RijksmuseumModern artists, particularly women, give another point of view: South African sculptor Nandipha Mntambo’s 2009 bronze of Jupiter as a bull is cast into a powerful, female form. The story of Arachne, who challenged the goddess Minerva to a weaving contest and was eventually transformed into a spider, becomes a massive bronze spider statue created by the late French-American artist Louise Bourgeois.A room about chaos and creation features Cuban-American artist Ana Mendieta’sBirth (Gunpowder Works). It depicts a female body made from earth and water, with what the gallery describes as a large “vulva-like form containing smouldering ash”.View image in fullscreenFresh point of view … Nandipha Mntambo’s 2009 bronze of Jupiter as a bull seen through a Louise Bourgeois spider.Photograph: Albertine Dijkema/RijksmuseumFrits Scholten, senior curator of sculpture, says there is a level of modern discomfort with the sexualisation of rape in some of Ovid’s stories and the art they inspired. “All these early stories in Ovid were reinterpreted by each generation and our generation looks at them in a different way,” he says. “We do address the fact that it’s often not very friendly to women.“At the same time, we say that you have to be nuanced in your view: these were scenes from fantasy, from ancient fairy tales, and they were often symbolic. I’m not saying that they are OK, but they exist, they are part of our culture and part of our history.”Scholten points to a copy of a painting of Leda and the Swan, once created by the Italian Renaissance master Michelangelo. “That’s a bedchamber piece,” he said. “You can be fairly sure that it hung over a bed in a palace in Italy. The original one by Michelangelo went to France and was destroyed by the French queen – she didn’t like it. So it is about power.”In celebrating these stories of change and transformation, Dibbits says the exhibition is ultimately about hope. “It gives a form to our fears, to the violence change often brings forth, but also the softness and the sweetness of it,” he says. “Everything undergoes a metamorphosis but the soul stays. That’s the hope: we haven’t lost our souls.”Metamorphoses is at the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam,from 6 February to 25 MayExplore more on these topicsMuseumsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After theGuardian’s writers nominated theirs– including Ramsgate in Kent, Falmouth in Cornwall, Abergavenny in Monmouthshire and Portobello in Edinburgh – we asked readers which UK towns they would put forward.Hastings, East SussexView image in fullscreen‘Culture is woven into everyday life’ … the 2024 Jack in the Green parade in Hastings.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersCulture in Hastings grows out of the shingle and the wind and the friction between past and present. You can feel it in the fishing fleet hauled up on the beach, still part of daily life, and then a short walk away in bold contemporary spaces showing work that speaks far beyond the town. It shows up in events that belong to the people who live there; Jack in the Green spilling through the streets; Pirate Day turning the whole place into a shared act of play; music competitions that quietly bring international talent into a town that never pretends to be grand.There is youth culture that is visible and unapologetic, from skate culture to artists and musicians building scenes without waiting for permission. Naming Hastings as UK town of culture would recognise a place where culture is already woven into everyday life and where investment would deepen something authentic, rooted and alive rather than trying to invent it.David Shopland, LondonGlastonbury, SomersetView image in fullscreen‘Something here for everybody’ … Brad Crowley, Glastonbury town crier.Photograph: Guardian CommunityMy calendar as Glastonbury town crier is packed with events attended by thousands of people, from the ecstatic revelry of Beltane in May, to the emergence of the red and white dragons twice a year to battle for the season, to theGoddess Conference, pilgrimages from church denominations across the globe and academic lectures on occultism coexisting side by side. There are hundreds of other such parades and gatherings throughout the year, and you can climb the Tor to marvel at the splendid views across the Somerset Levels – it’s one of the most stunning sights in the country.The high street and side alleys are filled with independent businesses, with hardly a chain brand to be seen (aside from the Co-op, which sells local produce such as cider and ales brewed within the town). From esoteric bookshops, crystal merchants, leatherworkers, blacksmiths, comic bookshops, record stores and clothing, there is something here for everybody.

EA Hornel, one of the “Glasgow boys” group, was raised in Kirkcudbright, and his home, studio and beautiful garden are open to the public. Many other Glasgow boys and girls visited and worked in the town too.The harbour and marina, and the streets of pastel painted houses, with glimpses down alleyways of hidden gardens, make any walk a stroll through a painting. The town centre is packed with a range of open air fairs during the summer – steampunk, anyone? – and the fish and chips from the van beside the harbour is delicious.

With its population of around 140,000 and location within easy distance of many other East Anglian towns, the impact would ripple out to other places, not only creating a social and economic benefit for the town itself but also acting as a catalyst to a large area in need of regeneration and motivation.Ipswich and the surrounding area is the birthplace of, among other notable figures, Thomas Wolsey andJohn Constable, and the town has a wealth of cultural landmarks, including its historical waterfront, Christchurch park and mansion, theNew Wolsey theatre,Red Rose Chain theatre,Eastern Angles theatre companyandDanceEast, to name but a few. Music, art and the spoken word all flourish – though often with insufficient financial and community support. Ipswich Town football club is supporting Ipswich’s bid to become the 2029 city of culture, and Ed Sheeran has been linked to the bid – another local lad.

It’s surrounded by beautiful vistas and landscapes, including Roundway Hill, which features bronze age barrows, an iron age hill fort known as Oliver’s Castle, a Romano-British water shrine, a civil war battlefield and the coach road from London to Bath. The town itself was founded by the Normans in the 11th century, although the castle fell into ruin and was rebuilt in Victorian times.

Our [former] songwriter and guitar player [Peter Svensson] suggested the name. We were super anglophiles. We loved British music. Our first album is called Emmerdale because the series was shown on Swedish TV every day, titled Home to the Farm. We romanticised something sort of rainy and hazy and woolly … like the cardigan.I like covers that have a new take on the original, so I really enjoyed your lounge-style version ofSabbath Bloody Sabbath. What made you choose that band [Black Sabbath] and song in particular?NotDrivingAMiniMetroWe were big fans – for a heavy band there’s a real pop sentiment in the songwriting – and I think it’s interesting when a cover is a stretch away from your natural sound. As a woman, I thought singing a song done by very manly men gave it a wonderfully creepy aspect. Ozzy [Osbourne] came to see us in Los Angeles and said it was the creepiest thing he’d ever heard, which coming from him is the biggest compliment.View image in fullscreenThe Cardigans in about 1997. From left: Peter Svensson, Nina Persson, bassist Magnus Sveningsson, keyboard player Lars-Olof Johansson and drummer Bengt Lagerberg.Photograph: Andy Willsher/RedfernsWas there something in the water inSwedenin the 90s that gave rise to the Cardigans, theWannadiesandStina Nordenstam– some of the happiest “dark” music I’ve ever heard?DomStocktonThere are a lot of takes on this – the weather, the sparseness of population – and Abba also had that thing of being happy on the surface but darker underneath. In Sweden, artistic expression was encouraged and we were helped to be creative. When you were eight or nine you were given a free recorder and then other instruments on free loans, so a poor child could play the violin without breaking the bank. Also, like in all countries, the traditional music has a sadness, a harmonic beauty with melancholia. All the kids’ TV shows we grew up with were scored by the best jazz players and musicians, so we were exposed to good quality music very early in our lives.TheCardigans’ [1995 album] Lifesounded completely different to the pop music at the time. What inspired that retro-inspired style?MartWolvesThere was a Swedish band called Eggstone who had a studio in Malmö equipped with tape recorders and an old BBC mixing desk. Everything was so aged and clunky but sounded fantastic. When we did our first album there with their producerTore Johanssonit was like a playground for us. We shed our whiny qualities and really found our shape. But when it came out it caused us a bit of trouble because everyone asked us about 60s pop and we didn’t know the references. I was into the Zombies, the Beatles and Nancy Sinatra, but for us it was more about what we could do with that style in the present.I loved the work you did withMark LinkousfromSparklehorse. What memories do you have of him or working together?GalaxyOfTheLostI had a friend crush on him. First I was a straight-up fan. Then he invited me to a concert and I couldn’t believe I had a direct line to my hero. I was really scared, but handed him my demos saying “just listen, whatever”. Then we stayed in touch and became a very odd pair of friends, age wise and culture wise, but something clicked. Musically it sure did. We both appreciated our differences. He was incredibly kind, soft and funny. We had a lovely time, but he also had that side where he was not doing so well mentally, sometimes. He had physical pain in his body and some darkness that wouldn’t leave him alone, for periods, so very early on I felt I had to help him. My husband and I had been struggling to have a baby, then two days after I learned I was finally pregnant,Mark died. It was the biggest win and the biggest loss at the same time, and then we had to perform at that really brutal funeral. I miss him a lot, but we have some of Mark’s instruments from his widow and our son’s middle name is Link, which is really nice because it keeps reminding us of Mark.Long Gone Before Daylightis one of my favourite albums everand hearing it at 14 opened my ears to a lifelong love of Americana. What had you been listening to to inspire the shift in direction?laurasnapesAmericana for sure, starting with Fleetwood Mac and the Band, who we called “beard rock”, then getting more into the wood, sea, bearded side of things. I’d already done the [Linkous-produced] A Camp record, which reflected my love of Americana, and I loved Neil Young and Dolly Parton and got deeper into country music. I was really happy that as a Swedish band the rest of the Cardigans also wanted to go in that direction. Before then, I thought sentimental music was cheesy, but I realised you have to open up to sentimentality and rawness from the heart. After the fun, ironic 90s it was a relief to think: “It’s fine. We’re human beings.”View image in fullscreenPerforming with the Manic Street Preachers at the Hultsfred festival in Sweden, 2007.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesManic Street Preachers are a famously tightly-knit band whohave worked closely together for decades. How did you find collaborating with them and were you able to bring your own input?HoppoThe songYour Love Alone Is Not Enough was already beautifully written and they just wanted my vocals. There was nothing for me to change at all, but James [Dean Bradfield, singer] came over to New York and we recorded it together, so it was really nice to be in the same room rather than just exchange digital files like many collaborations nowadays. Nicky [Wire] really liked our song Holy Love – there’s a certain recklessness, which may be why they chose me. We had a lot of fun. I love spending time with other tight-knit bands. We all understand that nature doesn’t make creators to remain in the same constellation – childhood friends staying together or whatever – so there’s something very strange and fantastic about it.You’ve worked with Tom Jones and Manic Street Preachers – what’s with the big love for Wales? Language, cuisine, or the weather?ParisDaveThere’s also Cardigan Bay [laughter]. I really like Wales, and touring withJames YorkstonI also got to dive deeply into Scotland. I really enjoy the close-knit directness of those communities. Tom Jones [with whom the Cardigans covered Talking Heads’Burning Down the House] is super sweet and had a real curiosity and joy for what we were doing. When we worked with him, his son was his manager and he brought his best childhood friend along – a bit like the Manics, in a way.View image in fullscreenAt the O2 Apollo, Manchester, in 2018.Photograph: Wenn Rights/AlamyI find your story of overcoming cancer inspiring. I live with a chronic illness (MS) and I find it’s made me more sensitive, more creative yet also more pessimistic about the future. How did illness change you?azapataUntil I was around 30 I’d hardly ever had a cold, so it was really weird at that age to face something with a possibly deathly outcome. My cancer was operable – I didn’t have to deal with chemo and stuff or get very very ill – so I’m very sorry to hear that your illness is chronic because that’s a whole different monster. I think the consolation prize for any kind of suffering is that you can appreciate things – art, for example – in a different way. You realise these things can happen to anyone. I’ve had 15 or 20 years of thinking “I’ve beaten cancer” but now I’m over 50 I’m thinking: it can totally happen to me again.It’s been20years sinceSuper Extra Gravity, my favourite album of yours.Was there something about that record that felt like it was time to stop making music ordo you have plans for any more?journowmWe were on a roll making that album and in our enthusiasm decided to make another right away. Then I started to hesitate … Throwing myself into another album and tour cycle would make me another two or three years later in trying to start a family. I said, “Actually, let’s have some time off.” Then I had to go through the cancer as well and we just dropped the ball. The main songwriter eventually lost patience, but the rest of us were excited to keep playing live. Now we have logistics issues – families, day jobs – but do toy with the idea of making new music, whether as the Cardigans or in a different form. We’re all capable of making great music and lately it’s been inspiring to see people like Suede from the 90s making new material. It’s not cringey middle-aged dudes looking hard in leather jackets. It’s really good stuff.‘Some artists thought it was too political’: can Jarvis, Damon, Olivia Rodrigo and Arctic Monkeys reboot the biggest charity album of the 90s?Read moreDid you knowNeil Hannonwas going tonamecheck youin the Divine Comedy’s songSweden?TheManWithoutFearIt was a surprise.

A year ago, I was probably at my second best in my life, but now I don’t think I could do it.

Andrea Arnold’s 2011 film was criticised for its grit and gloom while Emerald Fennell’s new version, which arrives in cinemas on Valentine’s Day, was described as “aggressively provocative” after test screenings. Perhaps now is the time to return to the source material. In the audioverse, there have already been readings by Michael Kitchener, Daniel Massey, Juliet Stevenson, Patricia Routledge and Joanne Froggatt, though I favour this 2020 edition narrated by Aimee Lou Wood, of Sex Education and The White Lotus fame.Set in Yorkshire, Emily Brontë’s tempestuous novel opens with Mr Lockwood, the new tenant at Thrushcross Grange, visiting his sullen landlord, Heathcliff, at his remote farmhouse where he gets snowed in. Bedding down for the night, he stumbles upon the diaries of the late Catherine Earnshaw, who writes of her love for Heathcliff, an orphan brought by her father to live with the family. Later Mr Lockwood has a nightmare in which the ghost of Catherine begs to be let in through the window (a scene immortalised in song by Kate Bush). The following day he returns to Thrushcross Grange where he asks the housekeeper, Nellie, to tell him about the Earnshaws. Nellie shares a dark tale of abuse, revenge and doomed love.Wood breathes fresh life into this tempestuous novel, capturing Nellie’s gossipy tone and the early wildness of Catherine and Heathcliff. As circumstances pull these once inseparable youngsters apart, that wild abandon curdles into desolation and discord that is carried down the generations.Available via Penguin Audio, 13hr 58minFurther listeningSimply MoreCynthia Erivo, Macmillan, 3hr 43 minThe singer, actor and star of Wicked tells of her path to stardom and shares tips on how to stay focused on your goals in a book that is part memoir, part empowerment manual.

Those who enjoyedhis interpretation at Wigmore Hallwill find plenty of the same rewarding elements here, not least the seeming ease with which the 21-year-old pianist untangles the music’s complex web of threads. Yet it’s good to find his interpretation wasn’t set in stone. Perhaps the New York performance had a more muscular bent, or perhaps the hints of romanticism in the later variations in London don’t register as strongly on a recording as in the hall.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for JS Bach: The Goldberg Variations performed by Yunchan Lim.Photograph: DeccaWhat is more striking on the recording is a strength in the faster variations that sometimes verges on the mechanical: impressive, and a little overdone. There are touches of playfulness too – when in a couple of the variations he switches to a higher octave, the music sounds like it’s on helium, lighter than air. The slow variation halfway through is deeply felt, the long 25thvariation touchingly done without quite staring into the abyss in the way that some performances do. It will be interesting to hear how Lim’s interpretation of the Goldbergs develops over the years, but this is a fine account to start with.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Whitney White’s gig-theatre quartet isn’t so much exploding Shakespeare as needling at it. The writer-composer-performer has a love for these plays and their musicality, but she also wants to ask difficult questions about them. Who’s allowed to take up space in these works? Who gets to perform in them? And why do so many of the ugly things in these plays continue to speak to us today?To grapple with these ideas, White takes on four of Shakespeare’s characters: Lady Macbeth, Emilia from Othello, Juliet, and Richard III. As a Black woman, she questions which parts of the canon are open to her, trying out a series of the playwright’s women before claiming one of his male leads. She is joined in her storytelling by a glorious, shape-shifting chorus of witches (Renée Lamb, Georgina Onuorah and Timmika Ramsay), a white male performer (Daniel Krikler) who is the ever-present “he” to her “she”, and a white female foil (Juliette Crosbie) representing the sorts of actors who will for ever be Juliets.View image in fullscreenRefrain tonight… Whitney White in All Is But FantasyPhotograph: Marc BrennerThe show takes some time to hit its stride. White begins by stepping into the boots of Lady Macbeth, a role offering plenty of swagger. She reframes the character as a woman pursuing her only path to power, before finding that power alone isn’t enough. But it’s in the second part, Emilia, that White’s creation gets real teeth. Here, female solidarity and white allyship are unpicked, and we’re challenged to consider the cost of reproducing violence against women on stage.In Juliet, White reluctantly takes on a role that has never felt like hers, while simultaneously questioning the version of youth, innocence and star-crossed love that Romeo and Juliet has bequeathed to contemporary culture. And finally, fed up with all these women who suffer and die, White decides to play one of the most villainous of Shakespeare’s men: Richard III. But is shrugging on the mantle of masculinity really a solution?‘To me, Lady Macbeth sounds like Tina Turner’: the musical mashup about to rock the RSCRead moreThe riffing on these texts sometimes threatens to become repetitive, circling around similar questions. But it’s a performance that also problematises itself, with the interrupting voices of the other performers adding complexity. And then there’s the music, bringing texture and passion to what could be a dry intellectual exercise. Each character or play has its musical signature – rock for Lady Macbeth, blues for Emilia – with refrains and echoes across the four parts, all brilliantly performed by the ensemble and the onstage band.White’s most compelling intervention is to turn the idea of “timelessness” on its head. We’re used to hearing that Shakespeare’s work transcends its time, but what does that say about our time? Or why – as White puts it – are we still lapping up stories of sexy men killing sexy women? Those looking for answers might be frustrated. But White leaves her audience sitting with the discomfort – perhaps to carry with us the next time we see one of these plays.AtThe Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon,until 21 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreRoyal Shakespeare CompanyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Aside from the first day, whenPossum Magicby Mem Fox and illustrator Julie Vivas took an early lead, Magic Beach was the most voted for book every other day of the count.With the recurring line “at our beach, at our magic beach”, Lester’s rhyming picture book from 1990 follows the different adventures children can have on a day at the beach, through both the wonders of the natural environment and the power of imagination. It’s illustrated in Lester’s instantly recognisable watercolour style.‘I also like that the dad cries’: children on their favourite Australian picture book of all time | Guardian readersRead moreLester was told about her win on Thursday, while at the very same beach in Walkerville South, Victoria, that inspired the picture book.“That is fabulous news – and how amazing it is that I am at Magic Beach while you are telling me,” she said.4:09Alison Lester finds out Magic Beach is Australia's favourite picture book – videoThe former Australian children’s laureate thanked everyone who voted for her book, saying: “I think I owe a lot to my family and friends who were all in there voting for me as well … There was such a huge number of beautiful books, so I am very, very thrilled.”Of all her books, Magic Beach has been translated into comparably few languages. “I think because it is a very Australian way that we go to the beach,” Lester said.“It is incredible that people still love it, and that its won this poll,” she said, adding with a laugh: “I always thought it would be good to share a similar position with the tawny frogmouth” – the winner of last year’sGuardian Australia bird of the year poll.Asked how she would celebrate her win, Lester said: “I’ll have to thank all the people first who stuck up for me, which is really nice. I’ll probably have a swim … I think that will be a nice way to celebrate.”Lester offered to share her prize with her fellow authors. When told it was just the kudos, she said: “That is much easier to share!”On the final day of voting, Magic Beach won with 2,557 votes, almost 800 votes ahead ofPossum Magic, in second place with 1,782 votes.View image in fullscreenMem Fox reads from her book Where is the Green Sheep? at home in Adelaide.Photograph: Carrie Jones/The GuardianWhere is the Green Sheep?by Mem Fox and illustrator Judy Horacek, came in third with 1,609 votes, whileDiary of a Wombatby Jackie French and illustrator Bruce Whatley came in fourth with 1,556.My Shadow is Pink by Scott Stuart – a much-loved picture book published in 2020 andsingled out last year by US president Donald Trump– had 1,436 votes, followed by Graeme Base’s intricately illustrated 1986 alphabet bookAnimalia, with 1,340 votes.Room on Our Rockby husband-and-wife authors Kate and Jol Temple, received 1,290 votes, followed closely by the 1976 classicThere’s a Hippopotamus on Our Roof Eating Cakeby Hazel Edwards and illustrator Deborah Niland, with 1,267 votes.6:43Alison Lester on how the natural world inspires her bestselling picture books – videoThe 2022 picture bookCome Over to My House, co-written by Sally Rippin and Eliza Hull and illustrated by Daniel Gray-Barnett, received 1,008 votes, withAll the Ways to Be Smartby Davina Bell and illustrator Allison Colpoys following just six votes behind with 1,002.Guardian readers initially voted in December to shape the top 50best Australian children’s picture books list, four of which were authored by Lester:Kissed by the Moon,Are We There Yet?,ImagineandMagic Beach. “I would be happy to have one, but to have four seems to be a bit of a miracle,” Lestertold the Guardian in January.Roughly 15,000 votes were cast every single day, with the bottom five books knocked out of competition before the votes reset for the next round.Explore more on these topicsPicture booksAustralia's best children's picture bookChildren and teenagersAustralian booksnewsShareReuse this content"

In written submissions, ANL’s legal team said all the claims made in relation to Furnish and John were “groundless and unsupported by the evidence before the court”.It said the articles being challenged were sourced variously from journalists’ contacts, the couple’s spokesperson, statements issued by their office, freelance journalists, photographers, news agencies and previous articles.Furnish, who gave evidence to the high court via an occasionally faulty video link, said he initially assumed stories must have come from leaks. However, he said he was approached byhis friend, the actor Elizabeth Hurley, in February 2021 about allegations relating to the Mail’s use of unlawful tactics.“We are very grateful that Elizabeth called us,” he said in a written submission. “If she hadn’t, we wouldn’t know what had happened and would never have known that the law had been broken and our private home and private lives barged into, violated by the Mail.”Hurley told them of allegations that a private investigator, Gavin Burrows, had admitted intercepting and recording live telephone conversations at their Windsor home for the Mail on Sunday.However, ANL said Burrows had now stated that he was “never involved in any investigation work in relation to Elton John” and “never intercepted communications relating to … anyone else who had anything to do with Elton John”.John and Furnish are alleging voicemail interceptions and other unlawful information gathering techniques were used in 10 articles, published from 2000 to 2015. They also allege two separate episodes of unlawful information gathering, which did not lead to an article.The couple allege that one 2009 article about John cancelling tour dates because he was unwell was developed with unlawful access to John’s medical information. However, Catrin Evans, a barrister for ANL, said the information was taken from a medical statement from John’s “own website” and from statements made by their spokesperson.However, Furnish said they were concerned by the “specific detail” about his treatment in the article.The pair claimed another article from August 2015, about John being taken ill in Monaco, also contained private information. However, Evans said similar information had appeared in the French press.Evans suggested Furnish’s social circle would give information to journalists. Furnish said his friends knew not to share private information about his family. He said that while he may engage in “harmless chitchat”, he had mastered “the art of saying nothing” when confronted with journalists.ANL also said John’s former spokesperson and publicist, Gary Farrow, “regularly provided the media, including Associated journalists, with information about their lives”. It said that included health and medical-related information that the couple were now complaining about.It said the claimants’ researchers and legal team were simply trying to link records of payments to private investigators with articles “loosely proximate in time to the payment record”, which they claimed to believe contained “hallmarks” of unlawful activity.ANL’s legal team said this approach was “unsupported by any evidence before the court and utterly baseless”.The case continues.Explore more on these topicsDavid FurnishElton JohnDaily MailNational newspapersNewspapers & magazinesMedia businessNewspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

You must know them. Melania” and “Does Melania wear Prada? Find out on Friday!”Writing on the cinema’sInstagram, Jordan Perry said: “Got a call that the higher ups (ie, at Amazon) were upset with how our marquee marketed their movie (ie, Melania), that, per them, Sunday would be its last day here.”Melania debuts at No 29 at the UK box officeRead morePerry added that he hoped Amazon wouldn’t cancel his Prime membership and directed devoted Amazon fans to “show your support at Whole Foods instead”. The cinema owner also addressed those who had criticised his decision to show the film in the first place.In a post titledWhy I, Jordan, Got Melania Here,”Perry wrote that his overriding instinct was that the programming “would be funny”. There was also a financial imperative, he added: “The film marketplace this week and next were a desert … So, to fill a screen, why not get this inexplicable vanity piece from the current president’s wife? I mean, it just seems so weird that it even exists (who wants a movie about Melania lol?), and wouldn’t it then be exponentially weirder, to the point of being funny, to show it here, at your obviously anti-establishment, occasionally troublemaking, neighbourhood cinema?”Amazon’s cancellation of the film in theOregoncinema comes as some in the US have flagged the incongruity of healthy ticket sales and apparently empty cinemas.The film took $7m (£5.1m) over its opening weekend domestically and opened at No 3 in the US box office charts.The Daily Beastreports that there have been accusations of “fake tickets sales” to boost the box office totals.View image in fullscreenA man puts up a poster for the screening of Melania, in Ljubljana, the capital of the first lady’s native Slovenia, the film’s best peforming international territory.Photograph: Darko Bandić/APCiting theSubstackof industry pundit Tom Brueggemann, the article claims: “Industry sources say there were signs that blocks of tickets were purchased for the weekend, then distributed to senior citizen homes, Republican activitists, other interested parties for free to help boost audiences.”Meanwhile Puck reporterMatthew Belloni saidAmazon and cinema chains AMC and Regal told him that they “did not experience unusual block purchases of tickets” for the film, while adding “the theatre chains might not necessarily know, of course”.One adult for the 9.40am in Sittingbourne: a front row seat for Melania’s ominous UK openingRead moreExit reports from weekend screenings in the US suggested that “older white women” were the demographic most responsible for propelling it to success.In the UK, where Melania opened across 155 screens, takings were considerably softer. The filmopened at No 29in the UK charts, for a weekend screen average of £212.The US takings for the film currently account for some 98.8% of its box office total, from a 30% share of the screen total (some 1,500 of the total 5,000 cinemas). At present, Melania’s native Slovenia proving the best-performing international territory. Overall, the film opened in 26 countries globally last Friday, after the South African release was abruptly cancelled the day before, with local distributors citing “the current climate” and “recent developments”.In the UK, some industry insiders questioned whether the unusually wide rollout of the film could be an indication of “four-walling”: the release strategy by which distributors pay cinemas to screen the movie.Explore more on these topicsMelaniaMelania TrumpOregonFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Of course I didn’t, because she’s braver than me. She asked me.”However the decision to cast Robbie in the role of Cathy has led to much scepticism and scrutiny ahead of the film’s release, specifically for its departure from the original 1847 novel byEmily Brontë.View image in fullscreenJacob Elordi in Wuthering Heights.Photograph: Photo Courtesy Warner Bros. PicturesRobbie, 35, will play Catherine Earnshaw who is written to be in her late teens in the original novel. The casting ofJacob Elordias Heathcliff has also been criticised. In the book, the character is described by Brontë to be of “Gypsy” and “Lascar” (South Asian) descent, which accounts for the prejudice against the him in the book.However Fennell defended her decision. “I can’t adapt the book as it is but I can approximate the way it made me feel,” she said.The casting director Kharmel Cochrane also defended the choice at the Sands film festival in Scotland last summer, saying that “there’s no need to be accurate” and it’s “just a book”.Robbie co-founded the production company LuckyChap Entertainment in 2014 with her husband, Tom Ackerley, as well as producers Josey McNamara, and Sophia Kerr. The company produced Fennell’s previous two films, Saltburn and Promising Young Woman.The adaptation of Wuthering Heights will premiere on 5 February in London’s Leicester Square and will be released in cinemas in the UK on 13 February for Valentine’s weekend.View image in fullscreen‘She’s braver than me’ … Margot Robbie in Wuthering Heights.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyThe film first premiered in Los Angeles on 28 January, withcritics calling it“intoxicating, transcendent, tantalising, bewitching, lust worthy, hypnotic” – although full reviews are embargoed until 8 February.Fennell’s directorial style has been characterised by her daring, provocative and at times indulgent social commentary. Speaking about how this style will continue in her latest feature she said: “Wuthering Heights needs to provoke a sort of primal response.”The director also spoke about the background behind the set design in the film, revealing that the wallpaper in Cathy’s bedroom was inspired by images of Robbie’s skin.“We asked her to send us all her veins and her freckles, and then we printed it on silk and stuffed it and put latex over it so that it could sweat,” she said. “At first glance, you don’t see any of it, it’s just a beautiful pink room.”“It’s like a visual example of what it feels like to be made a wife, to be made an object of beauty, to be a collector’s item.”Other unconventional behind the scenes activity involved shrines Fennell made of Elordi and Robbie as a way to mimic the infatuation their respective characters have with one another in the film. “I was like: ‘I’m going to go through the internet, I’m going to find their best photos and then I’m going to make shrines in their bedrooms for each other,’” she saidView image in fullscreen‘I can’t adapt the book as it is but I can approximate the way it made me feel’ … Emerald Fennell speaks at BFI Southbank.Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images for Warner Bros.“So when Jacob went into his room, he had an insane shrine to worship not just Cathy, butMargot Robbieand then she had the same thing. There’s nothing more humanising than somebody’s first press photo.”Fennell also spoke about the process of getting Charli xcx onboard to create the soundtrack for the film: “I sent Charli the script. Even though she was in the middle of the brat tour, the most busy person in the entire world, she read it immediately.”“She called me and said: ‘What do you want?’ I said: ‘Well, a song would be nice.’ And she said: ‘How about an album?’ And I was like: ‘Yeah, cool.’”“It’s so dorky, but it is my favourite album I’ve ever, ever heard in my life.

It’s supposed to make you fearful.“The Greeks wrote those plays because they wanted you to look at your inner darkness. If we mollycoddle the audience too much, what’s the point?”Noting that some universities would not study Shakespeare “because they don’t want to upset students”, Doyle said: “Shakespeare wrote about everything that there is to be about the human condition at its darkest. Incest, murder, regicide, you name it, he wrote about it. But there’ll be nothing left if we make everything ‘nice’. We shouldn’t be afraid of challenging the audience at every opportunity.”He added: “My response is simple – why read, see or do the play if you’ve been warned that it may upset you? It’s meant to upset you.“There’s a big debate that should be had about how we inform our audiences and how we sustain the surprise and disturbance that is intrinsic in playmaking.”View image in fullscreenJohn Doyle, left, working with composer Stephen Sondheim, centre, and librettist John Weidman, right.Photograph: Adam LensonJudi Dench on trigger warnings: if you’re that sensitive, avoid the theatreRead moreTrigger warnings inform audiences that they may find a particular drama distressing, alerting them to everything from violence to loud noises. The Royal Shakespeare Company has included what it describes as “content advisory” notices in its new touring production of Hamlet, telling audiences that it contains “scenes of an adult nature including death and depictions of grief”.In 2024, dismissing the need for such warnings, Dame Judi Dench advised “sensitive” fansnot to go to the theatre, saying: “It must be a pretty long trigger warning before King Lear or Titus Andronicus”.Doyle recalled working with students on a production of Strindberg’s Miss Julie: “One of them was cross with me because I hadn’t given her a trigger warning about the play. She said that the play upset her. I said: Well, Strindberg wanted you to be upset. If I gave you a trigger warning, I would have been taking away the aim of the writer.’”View image in fullscreenCynthia Erivo in The Color Purple.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDoyle has been hailed as the saviour of theBroadwaymusical. His acclaimed productions include Sweeney Todd, Company and The Color Purple. The latter was a box office hit that starred Cynthia Erivo and Jennifer Hudson on Broadway in 2015, having transferred from London, where it was staged by the Menier Chocolate Factory.He has just published his first book,Opening Doors: Reimagining the American Musical, which “reflects on the 50-year theatrical journey” taken by a boy who grew up in a council house in Inverness in a family that had no money.In one passage, he recalled that his mother came from a generation “devoid” of trigger warnings. “They could face the uncomfortable aspects of what make us human,” he wrote. “I have great reservations about warning the audience of what they are going to experience. Isn’t that raw experience, the point of the theatre? Perhaps to disturb really is part of the job.”He argued that part of the problem was the steep cost of staging productions in an industry where the financial risk is “extreme” and very few companies make back the money they invest. “Producers and directors have become afraid of challenging the audiences because somebody might say: ‘Oh, don’t go and see it as it’s too upsetting.’”Critics have noted that Doyle made his name by stripping musicals down to their bare essentials. In productions such as Cabaret and Fiddler on the Roof, for example, the actors played the instruments on stage.View image in fullscreenJohn Doyle: ‘I have reservations about warning the audience of what they are going to experience. Isn’t that the point of the theatre?’Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The GuardianHe believes that the cost of making theatre has “got out of hand” and that the art form is “not as culturally inclusive as it should be”, partly because tickets have become so expensive.He added: “That’s because it’s so expensive to make theatre and I think that’s not necessary. We shouldn’t be making movies on stage that rely on spectacle and spectacular special effects.“We should go back to honest storytelling that needn’t cost as much money. Once you put technological imagery on a platform as an artist, you’re not really any longer in control of that. It’s not your soul. Go back to something that is storytelling, which is people in a room talking to each other.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreBroadwayMusicalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Again, this was dominated by spend by US streamers such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+, which accounted for 80% of the total.Among the biggest TV shows were Bridgerton, Slow Horses, Outlander and The Thursday Murder Club.Spending by UK broadcasters such as ITV, Sky, Channel 4 and Channel 5 increased slightly to £688m, after havingdropped to a five-year low in 2024.However, despite a vibrant 2025, during which total spending on UK-made films and high-end TV rose by 13% to £6.8bn, the push by Donald Trump for increased production in the US is already putting pressure on future spending commitments.On Tuesday, Sarandos was questioned by the US Senate’s antitrust subcommittee about Netflix’sproposed $82.7bn offerfor the studios and streaming businesses of WBD.He said the approval of anew tax credits scheme in New Jersey, where Netflix is building a studio complex, competed with “UK incentives” and brought “production home” to the US.“Since that incentive passed we had 11 projects, seven of which were slated for the UK and were pulled back into New Jersey,” he told senators.“Some of the incentives that we were able to work on … have made it so competitive to film in New Jersey that there is no reason to go overseas for film production. Not just for Netflix but for others. We are very invested in creating more American jobs [and] keeping production in America.”In September, Ollie Madden, a former director of Film4 and Channel 4 drama, joined Netflix UK as its new head of film. Madden will also work with Dan Lin, the chair of Netflix Film, to develop new movies for its global slate.“Our commitment to the UK is as strong as it’s ever been,” said a spokesperson for Netflix UK. “Over the last four years we’ve spent $1.5bn annually and that continues to be the case.”Explore more on these topicsFilm industryTelevision industryBFINetflixnewsShareReuse this content"

This was a surprise for two reasons: I’m chronically online so I usually see everything first, and also there are no good news stories any more in this life. But it was real, and for many people, including me, this one piece of blessed news was equal to three or four regular pieces of good news.It is a rat king of good news, a fatberg of good news clogging up my pipes. It had beenannounced that*trumpets heralding**doves released*the iconic Nigella Lawson is joining the iconic The Great British Bake Off!!!!!! (I don’t know how many exclamation marks are allowed in the Guardian style guide, I might be pushing it.)Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsMy reaction might seem over the top, but I won’t allow you to Debbie Downer this news that has turned my frown upside down. One of my favourite people on the planet to watch on TV, joining a TV show I love and watch every season of. As a TV lover, nothing could be better. Bake Off is a wonderful, cosy, sweet, fun and delicious show. Unlike other reality competition shows (which I also love), the contestants on the showarethere to make friends. I’ve enjoyed Prue Leith’s reign on the show, she is an experienced and polite woman, but I am filled with delighted anticipation about what the new season will look like with the addition of the eponymous Nigella.Changes to judging lineups are inevitable in long-running reality shows, and the shift in dynamic can sometimes cause issues, but in this case I feel as chill as puff pastry between laminations. The show has already been through several host and judge shake-ups over the last few years, and the previous change was one of the best, replacing Matt Lucas (I used to shut one eye and try to pretend he wasn’t there) with the delightful Alison Hammond. Alison is a hilarious presence who also says “bake” like “BIYKE”, forcing you to repeat it in your own home every time. I respect Prue, but I can’t wait to see how Alison and Nigella vibe. I think, like Alison, Nigella will be an extremely warm presence, which will work well with Paul Hollywood’s statue-like husky-eyed, semi-evil demeanour. I suspect we may see a slight rise in double entendres, but if anyone disrespects Nigella, they will be facing the wrath of a global audience. Just because we like watching sweet baking shows doesn’t mean we can’t get revenge.Vertigo has turned my world upside down. But knowing there are famous people suffering steadies me | Rebecca ShawRead moreI was curious about whether Nigella would bring the cosy and intimate vibe she is most known for, or if she would switch it up for the show and become a stringent judge. Then Iread thisinterview:“I’m not someone who looks for fault, I look for pleasure,” she said, positioning herself as the counterbalance to Hollywood’s famously technical lens. “I’m all about the eating,”she added.Thank God. Actually, this is the only area I can see Nigella causing an issue. The tent they bake in is not temperature controlled, which can cause big issues with baking and also with English people, who aren’t able to cope above 25C. Everyone is already sweaty and stressed, and thenNigella Lawsonappears? To judge you? I’d be afraid of becoming incapacitated. I know there are already a lot of shows to watch Nigella do her thing, but I’m most looking forward to watching her interact with the contestants.Bake Off is quite often a really diverse show, especially compared with scripted television. It’s hard to predict who will be more obsessed with her – the queer women? The gay men? The underappreciated mothers? The straight lads with a heart of gold? The straight dads with a heart of gold? Nigella is funny, charming, warm, smart and beautiful. She is relaxed with all sorts of people, seems down to earth, and her dynamic with each of the unique individuals on the show will be a really fun part of the viewing experience.The decision to hire her makes complete sense. She has the skills, the temperament, the fans. In my mind, she should already be spending her life where random people just prepare delicious things for her to have bites of. If she was carried around the tent on a palanquin by big strong men and fed peeled grapes as a palate cleanser between each tasting, that would also feel completely right to me. It’s got all the ingredients for a perfectly baked show.It might not seem like much, but more and more we have to celebrate the small wins, the nice things, the things we can look forward to. In these grim and bleak times, I can picture a future of Nigella eating things with a little fork in the Bake Off tent, and that’s enough to keep me going.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsThe Great British Bake OffOpinionNigella LawsonFood TVTelevisionReality TVcommentShareReuse this content"

However, it is an intimate, and sometimes moving, family portrait as well as a social history of race, class and aspiration in late 20th‑century Britain.The opening chapters, with their ubiquitous skinheads and “Run, Paki, run” taunts, contain the book’s most arresting scenes. Racism is continuous and targeted: from graffiti on his father’s shop windows to the everyday humiliations at school, and on the buses where his father had bravely fought an informal colour bar to become a bus driver.Javid doesn’t shy away from showing the cruelty of 1970s and 80s Britain for brown and black kids. White neighbours and co‑workers help the family inhabit the same space as racists, and the book makes it clear that the system is hostile even when individuals can be kind.The Colour of Home is an affecting study of Javid’s parents, particularly his indefatigable mother. Her illiteracy sits in counterpoint to her fierce commitment to her sons’ education: spotless uniforms, regimented homework and trips to Rochdale Library. Javid’s father is shown as a man of energy but limited luck: a bus driver who repeatedly launches small clothing businesses that almost always fail.School is a site of trauma. Javid does not airbrush the brutality of playground racism – from the boy trying to “rub the black off” his own arm with sandpaper, to Javid’s shame‑soaked rejection of a black classmate in order to fit in.Alongside these scenes is the story of intellectual ignition: the tutor who continues to teach him for free, the pink pages of the Financial Times abandoned on a bus, the sense that reading could be a reliable means of escape.Javid is not a natural writer; the prose is a bit “Jack and Jill”, and it could have done with a sharp edit. It is at its best when it occupies a Dickensian domestic precariousness, the presence of bailiffs, the stock that never sells, the children in trouble. These short, vivid chapters – “Dettol and determination”, “Britain’s most dangerous street” – carry a clear narrative. The memoir’s argument about meritocracy is more nuanced than Javid’s political slogans ever were.Racist rhetoric and policy have become defining features of mainstream British politicsPolitically, the memoir compels because it refuses to tidy away contradiction. Javid’s father moves from scepticism about Margaret Thatcher to voting for her, even as his own life is crushed between property developers, debt and deregulated markets. Javid is clearly inspired by his father to rise through the Conservatives, but this sits disturbingly next to the book’s record of racism.In fact, reading his story in the context of the past decade of Tory rule illustrates how his party exploited the narratives of children like him while entrenching policies that brutalised people who look like his parents. For instance, when he was home secretary in 2019, Javid shamefully revoked Shamima Begum’s British citizenship shortly after she was discovered in a Syrian refugee camp. Begum had been trafficked to Syria as a 15-year-old in 2015.Similarly, his successor Priti Patel’s posture as a child of immigrants “taking back control” functioned as political cover for policies that coerced people into destitution. The “hostile environment” approach to immigration enforcement, initiated by Theresa May, but a persistent feature of Home Office culture after her departure, fostered racist practices and contributed directly to the Windrush scandal, in which black Britons were detained and threatened with removal from a country they had the full legal right to call home. Javid later claimed hedidn’t likethe term “hostile environment”, but nevertheless defended and maintained the structures that perpetuated it.Suella Braverman’s stint as home secretary took this fusion of identity politics and punitive policy even further, marrying the image of a British Asian woman in one of the great offices of state to apocalyptic language about “invasions” of small‑boat arrivals. Her speeches repeatedly framed a “law‑abiding patriotic majority” against desperate people crossing the Channel. In both cases, the presence of non‑white women at the top of the Home Office did not soften the edge of Conservative immigration policy; it helped insulate a hardening border regime from charges of racism while it continued to inflict racialised harm. And while Javid might not have been a member of the government by then, he remained a member of the party for which these were official positions.Racist rhetoric and policy have now become defining features of mainstream British politics. Recent reporting about Nigel Farage’stime at Dulwich Collegeunderlines how little distance there is between the corridors of elite education, racist language and political success. Taken together with The Colour of Home’s scenes of playground racism, these testimonies show continuity rather than rupture: the same casual dehumanisation of Jews, black people and Asians.In this context, its portrait of a boy learning to survive and outthink that environment – and his insistence that education, solidarity and institutional self‑scrutiny are the only real antidotes – feels less like a nostalgic political origin story and more like an urgent warning about the Britain that comes next. Javid, cheerfully now in the “Big House”, can at times sound like an Uncle Tom: his narrative minimises structural barriers and suggests minorities simply need to work harder in order to succeed.His decision to concentrate on his early years and write little about his rise through the Tory party represents a serious omission. Surely he has much to tell about the inner workings of the now imploded Conservatives. But perhaps he’s saving that for another volume. It would be fun to read if he can be as honest about that as he is about his childhood.The Colour of Home: Growing Up in 1970s Britain by Sajid Javid is published by Abacus (£25).

And the aim on their part, of course, is always to beguile, and often to deceive.And yet the temptation is sometimes too great to resist.Mark Haddon, whose blistering memoir details a mainly miserable and loveless childhood and an adulthood studded with significant hurdles, hit the literary jackpot with The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time in 2003. In it, a teenage protagonist who struggles to communicate with the world around him uncovers a world of lying adults – most egregiously, he has been told his mother has died, rather than absconded with the nextdoor neighbour – and runs away from home. A more recent novel, The Porpoise, opens with a fatal air crash before morphing into a reworking of Pericles; in Leaving Home, we discover that Haddon is terrified of flying. We also learn that he borrowed heavily from childhood holidays in Brighton to create the atmosphere and texture for his story The Pier Falls, a merciless, documentary-style narration of a cataclysmic seaside disaster.It’s not a stretch, then, to note that the raw material of his upbringing is vitally important; specifically, a near-total absence of love or affection, his mother’s apparent withdrawal – to bed, or to drink – from family life, a continual thrum of undermining. What’s more fascinating is to consider the variety of modes he uses to achieve a kind of creative elasticity. Haddon’s work moves between strikingly plain reportage, as if to say “this happened”, and flights of fancy and fantasy, often rooted in classical mythology with its possibilities of shape-shifting and other mutations. As this memoir makes clear on almost every single page, he is as much interested in images as words; there are hundreds of illustrations, from the wincingly explicit photographs of his elderly mother’s open foot wound or the scars of his own heart bypass surgery, to his puckish collages and phantasmagorical paintings and sculptures. His work, whether verbal or visual, is a reclamation yard. In one crude cartoon, a rugby-playing father rebukes his weeping son with the words “I have sired a weakling child”. Beneath runs the son’s riposte: “But he will draw pictures of you when you are DEAD HAHAHAHA HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA.”The question remains: can you recover from – or even avenge – an unhappy childhood by dismantling and remaking it differently in adulthood? In one demonstrable sense, yes: not only has Haddon made a life in literature, he has his own family, and a strong and continuing bond with his sister, Fiona. But alongside the evident joy he finds in acts of creation, in personal relationships and in activities such as running, there is damage that the book suggests he needs to examine and catalogue, to somehow fix in place.‘To say I was the favourite would imply I was liked’: Mark Haddon on a loveless childhoodRead moreHe does not gloss over it. Early on, the reader comes face to face with a photograph of a newly sutured arm; above it, a doodle of a dog, with bleeding forepaw, and the caption “And what, precisely, is this going to solve?” Two matter-of-fact paragraphs opposite describe Haddon’s visit to A&E: he cut himself deliberately, but “accidentally” chose a new scalpel “instead of the scissors I might normally use” and went too deep. He cuts when he is “uncontrollably angry” with himself; calm returns quickly, leaving him “embarrassed” (an emotion that recurs frequently) and “apologetic” to the hospital staff who care for him. Perhaps the most shocking thing for the reader is that this particular event happened in 2024; there is no statute of limitations on feeling desperate.What, then, to do with the nostalgia – the sense of longing for the sights, sounds, smells and artefacts of the 1970s – that grips and confuses him? One answer is to put those thoughts and feelings into a work like this – an incredibly detailed, painful, funny, horrifying and exhilarating record of how to live beside what has happened.Leaving Home: A Memoir in Full Colour by Mark Haddon is published by Chatto & Windus (£25).

Consider, however, that multiple actors have won more than one Oscar. (Emma Stone, one of this year’s best actress nominees, won twice in the past decade.) Only a single cat, meanwhile, has twice won the Patsy – the Picture Animal Top Star of the Year. (The award, given by the American Humane Association, not to be confused with the Humane Society, was discontinued in 1986.) That cat is Orangey, the subject of a small retrospective at New York City’s Metrograph cinema. Plenty of rep houses will play a movie like Breakfast at Tiffany’s around Valentine’s Day; the Metrograph is going deeper into the Orangey catalogue for a wider variety of titles and genres.‘I’m so co-o-old’: ahead of Wuthering Heights, the 20 best films with dreadful weather – ranked!Read moreBreakfast at Tiffany’s does offer Orangey his most famous role: the rather less colorfully named Cat, pet of Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), who calls him a “poor slob without a name”. Orangey features heavily in the film’s climax, when Holly releases her pet into an alley as she prepares to leave town, only to have Paul (George Peppard) rush to retrieve him. It completes a running thread that Cat is a part of Holly’s wildness as well as her potential domestication. What better animal, of course, than one equally prone to draping himself over his makeshift mistress and making yowling leaps around her apartment?The Audrey Hepburn classic won Orangey his second Patsy; his first was for a bigger role in Rhubarb, a comedy from a decade earlier about a cat that inherits ownership of an eccentric rich man’s estate, including a Brooklyn baseball team. This sounds like a proto-Air Bud – there’s nothing in the rulebook that says a cat can’t own a baseball team! – but Rhubarb appears to have been made with adults at least nominally in mind. It’s a 50s screwball comedy, which is to say it’s pokier than its classic-era counterparts from a decade earlier, and feels padded out (if still amusing) at 95 minutes. Still, Orangey steals plenty of scenes; even more than in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, this cat leaps heedlessly between furniture items, at one point parking himself atop a chandelier. He’s far more memorable than his agreeable two-legged co-stars.View image in fullscreenJan Sterling, Orangey and Ray Milland in Rhubarb.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyHuman stars do maintain one advantage, though. There is only one Audrey Hepburn and there are, admittedly, somewhere between two and 40 Orangeys. At least two cats actually played Cat in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, and in general it’s difficult to draw any straight lines across Orangey’s biologically feasible but logistically questionable 16 years of credits. Deeper research into his career tends to lead to conflicting reports. Film-maker and critic Dan Sallitt wrote a bit about Orangey forFilmmaker Magazine, locating a passage from the book Amazing Animal Actors explaining that the making of Rhubarb actually involved recruiting a whopping 60 different-but-similar-looking cats – the movie is in black-and-white, so perhaps a precisely matching hue was not a great concern – and selecting 36 particularly trainable cats, each doing an assigned trick, to create a single composite performance. (This only defies belief in that, as much as Rhubarb the cat does in the movie, I’m not sure we see 36 distinct tricks.) A contemporaneousNew York Times articleputs the number of Rhubarbs at 10, though director Arthur Lubin does describe a “principal” cat who bit him, prompting the director to “retaliate with a shrewd kick” while the Humane Association representative wasn’t looking. This does seem compatible with the Rhubarb character, who is largely disagreeable at first.Feed them, love them and play them drum’n’bass: vets’ tips for keeping pets happy and healthyRead moreWatching the cat performances both within the movies and across the different titles certainly lends credence to the idea that Orangey was more a cat type, provided by trainer Frank Inn, than a specific animal. Two films in the Metrograph retrospective showcase Orangey’s genre versatility: he supposedly has a small part in the western Stranger on Horseback, and more of a supporting role in the horror goof The Comedy of Terrors – both films directed by Jacques Tourneur, who also, appropriately enough, made the 1942 classic Cat People. (That was before your time, Orangey.) But despite the shared director, these two cats seemingly aren’t much alike in temperament or performance style. The animal in Horseback lounges around a lawman’s office like an unbothered and casually cuddly bodega cat; the one in Terrors (made when Orangey would have been at least 13) zips around with the vigor of a cat half his age. Maybe he was invigorated by the prospect of sharing scenes with an all-star cast of horror icons; with Vincent Price, Basil Rathbone, Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre on hand, this may be Orangey’s most stacked ensemble (due respect to Ms Hepburn).It’s more fun, of course, to imagine Orangey embarking upon a singular 16-year career, rather than flitting in and out of random scenes from various films. In that sense, his spiritual successor is the orange-ish cat fromInside Llewyn Davis, also played by several felines, described by director Joel Coen as“a pain in the ass.”As Coen says, dogs often want to please people; cats have little such interest, which of course only winds up drawing our attention further. It’s like watching a baby in a movie; you’re struck by the cuteness and then, perhaps, by the uncanny sensation that for a moment you’re watching someone on screen who cannot actually be acting in the traditional sense. For the babies and the cats, the scenes are real, regardless of whether they involve absurd plots, murderous funeral directors or fake socialites (and also regardless of whether the cat in question cares at all). Even the most intense adult human actors are pretending. Orangey, in all of his indeterminate forms, actually lives the movies.Explore more on these topicsFilmCatsBreakfast at Tiffany'sAudrey HepburnPetsAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But what she’d really like to get her teeth into is a certain dino franchiseThu 5 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTShareStacy Martin is “not a religious person”. Still, the actor insists things have happened in her life that have made her realise there’s “a whole expanse of things that are unexplainable”. Once, at home in north London, she noticed a lightbulb flickering. She couldn’t solve the mystery: no matter how many times she changed it, the bulb continued to blink. Instead of consulting the internet, Martin went to see her psychic, a tea leaf reader she meets annually, booking in under a fake name.The psychic suggested that someone was trying to communicate with her. “I was like: ‘What if I just start talking to this person that apparently wants to talk to me?’” says Martin. “And so I did. And that light never flickered again.” Martin prefers not to use the word ghost, but she’s aware there are things the mind can’t make sense of; things the body somehow knows.In her new film, The Testament of Ann Lee, her body is a vessel for the divine. Mona Fastvold’s wild movie musical tells the story of the 18th-century religious leader and mother of four who swore off sex with her husband but gave her body over to God. Ann Lee (Amanda Seyfried), founder of the Shakers, expresses devotion through song and dance, writhing, trembling and shaking her way to deliverance. Martin plays a key part as Jane “Mother Jane” Wardley, leader of the Shaking Quakers and the woman “who showed Ann Lee who she could become”, says Martin.Co-written with Fastvold’s partner Brady Corbet (director of The Brutalist), scored by the Oscar-winning experimental musician Daniel Blumberg and featuring hypnotic, ecstatic choreography by Celia Rowlson-Hall, the film is unlike anything I’ve ever seen.No one would ever think of me in a musical. I like the idea of transgressing expectationsSince her breakout role in Lars von Trier’s Nymphomaniacin 2013, Martin has worked with arthouse provocateurs including Michel Hazanavicius, Ben Wheatley and, on three different occasions, Corbet. On screen, the half-French, half-British actor and model appears coolly intelligent and, sometimes, a little stern. “No one would ever think of me to be in a musical,” says Martin, “and so I like this idea of transgressing expectations.”Barefaced and wrapped in a fuzzy grey jumper, she is video calling from the study of her home in Beachwood Canyon, Los Angeles, which has the appearance of an oak-panelled library. “A lot of my books are still in London,” says Martin, who is now living between the two cities, and has been contemplating whether she should simply buy all her books twice. “Is that outrageous?” she asks, eyebrows furrowing. “I think it is.”Martin is quick-witted with a surprising, dry sense of humour. Lately, she has been reading “this great David Lynch biography” and getting into quantum physics. “Some of my dear friends love it and I have no idea what the hell they’re talking about, so I’m trying to wrap my head around it.”When she was researching the Shakers, Martin found little information about Mother Jane, except for “what she says to Ann Lee about not having relations with her husband”. Today, the Shakers are best known for the integrity of their minimalist wooden furniture. But the dwindling Protestant sect are also notorious for their celibacy, with just three remaining members alive today. Martin was amused by the seeming contradiction between her character’s chaste marriage and her passionate spiritual reveries. “For the movement to be so visceral, and about catharsis, and worshipping … I was just quite surprised that she decided not to have sex with her husband,” she says with a chuckle. But Martin was interested in the idea of abstinence as a potent form of power. At that time, she says, “it probably made sense for women, because it was the only way they could really gain status”. The Shakers believed in gender equality and so by removing desire, “it wasn’t about women and men being part of a hierarchy that I think sex will always shape”.She was also curious about the shaking. She was mesmerised by the “tender violence” of Rowlson-Hall’s expressive, instinctive choreography. Learning the film’s dance sequences over a two-week rehearsal period was “like summer camp”, she says. “Not that I’ve ever been to summer camp.”Martin first met Fastvold in 2015, in “freezing Budapest” on the set of Corbet’s debut film, The Childhood of a Leader. The married couple direct their own films but write together, working with a recurring cast of collaborators. “In French, it’s atroupe,” Martin says, slipping into a perfect accent. “T-R-O-U-P-E, that sense of working with the same people, in a space where you’re being pushed because they all know you so well.” Fastvold and Corbet’s troupe includes Martin, Blumberg (Martin’s ex-partner of 14 years), who scored The Testament of Ann Lee as well as The Brutalist, Rowlson-Hall (who also choreographed Natalie Portman in Corbet’s Vox Lux) and the actor Christopher Abbott, who plays Ann Lee’s despicable husband and has appeared in all of their films.Fastvold and Corbet are “very in symbiosis”, says Martin. “They’re both committed to writing a story that is bigger than them, that also feels very close to their heart.” In The Testament of Ann Lee, Martin reckons Fastvold is exploring her own relationship to motherhood. “Not just in terms of having children, but creating a space for people to thrive, and for artists to come together and be greater than what society’s told them.” A natural matriarch and “force of nature” on set, Fastvold has also spent the last decade as a kind of mother figure to Martin. “She met me when I was a baby! I’ve been in all their films, I’ve lived with them, they’ve lived with me. I’ve seen their daughter grow up,” says Martin. “She understands that sometimes there isn’t a solution, we just need a rant. That is an incredible friend to have.”The Brutalist was arguably the surprise critical darling of last year’s awards season and went on to win three Oscars. Martin says the film’s success felt like an affirmation “of all the decisions and instincts I’ve had about film-makers”. The actor has, by her own admission, actively pursued a career in independent cinema. After Nymphomaniac, “making sure I worked with artists and I worked on films that were director-led, that was a big thing for me”, she says.At the Oscars they give you alcohol under your seat – I think it was tequila. It’s useful, because it is quite longIt was a particularly special moment, then, when at the end of The Brutalist’s long awards campaign, Martin attended the Oscars with Fastvold and Corbet. “They give you alcohol under your seat – I think it was tequila,” she says, deadpan. “It’s useful to keep people’s spirits up, because it is quite long.” The spectacle of the ceremony was a little strange, she says, but entertaining to witness. “I just thought: You’ll probably never go back, so make the most of it,” she says.Over email, Fastvold describes Martin as “a true cinephile” with “an instinctive understanding of the larger vision of a film”. Martin is a regular at east London’s Close-Up, a tiny cinema and lending library just off Brick Lane, and a collector of DVDs. “There was an amazing guy in Stoke Newington,” she says, who used to run The Film Shop, a video and DVD rental shop specialising in world cinema. “It was all from the Criterion Collection and Second Run. I’d go there and take a film from a director I knew and then he would recommend another film. It was so great,” she says wistfully. “The ritual of it, I really loved.” When it closed, she was so devastated she ended up buying half the shop. “I was like: ‘What are you gonna do with all these films?!’”The Testament of Ann Lee review – strikingly strange portrait of radically ecstatic Shaker leaderRead moreLast year, impatient between projects, Martin wrote and directed her first short film. “I didn’t realise, as an actor, just how shielded you are from the whole experience.” Being behind the camera, she says, “was like an on-set experience on steroids”. One of her next films, The Queen of Fashion, about avant garde fashion editor Isabella Blow, will see her step into designer Daphne Guinness’s hoof-shaped platform shoes. When Blow died, Guinness bought almost all of her clothes. Guinness lent her archive to the production. “We had original McQueen pieces, we had Philip Treacy’s lobster hat, we had original Marc Jacobs pieces that still had soup on them,” she remembers.“I don’t want to do the same thing over and over again,” Martin says. Over the summer, she shot a studio adaptation of Sense and Sensibility, in which she plays formidable Jane Austen villain Fanny Dashwood. She says she hasn’t steered away from Hollywood blockbusters, but that “they just never came to me”. Now having carved out an enviable career in indies, the mainstream is firmly in her sights. Still only 35, she is “trying to manifest being in the next Jurassic Park”. It was the first film she ever saw in the cinema, and it blew her mind. “If I say enough, it’s just bound to happen.”The Testament of Ann Lee is released in UK cinemas on 27 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe BrutalistfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s an austerely challenging reading and incidentally, right about now, nothing could be further from the richly empathetic and redemptive approach ofChloé Zhao’s Hamnet, about the play’s imagined origins.The setting is modern London’s world of shady family business and family dysfunction, wedding parties, blandly scheming associates and SUVs speeding through the night-time streets. Hamlet looks here like no one as much as Kendall Roy from TV’s Succession.Riz Ahmedplays the prince, horrified by a ghostly vision of his dead father (Avijit Dutt) who, in a chilling scene, summons him to a bleak urban rooftop to announce he was murdered by his brother Claudius (Art Malik). Claudius now is a hard-faced property speculator who has evicted a tented community of people led by Fortinbras from some prime real estate, and who now intends to marry Hamlet’s mother, Gertrude (Sheeba Chaddha).Hamlet retreats into shocked, enraged indecision and a kind of confrontational madness intended to embarrass the wrongdoers while exempting him from actual punitive action; it creates a growing miasma of authentic tension. Timothy Spall is the ingratiating, menacing Polonius, whose murder is brutally explicit and violent, and deliberate in a way it isn’t in the original.Morfydd Clarkis Polonius’s daughter Ophelia, now deeply hurt at her former suitor Hamlet’s sudden and fanatical coldness to her, and Joe Alwyn is her brother Laertes.Ahmed carries the production with his performance of someone convulsed with weakness and self-hate. This film loses most of the soliloquies (including “Alas, poor Yorick” and the skull), which traditionally get the audience on Hamlet’s side, though “To be, or not to be” stays;Hamletvirtually screams it at the wheel of his car. Ophelia’s importance to Hamlet is fractionally increased by rerouting some of Hamlet’s dialogue with Horatio to her, although we lose Ophelia’s mad scene, which is a misjudgment, I think.Overall, this is an intelligent and focused account and one which, at least at first, allows you to ask the question: what if Claudius, however unscrupulous and predatory, is in fact innocent of murder? What if the ghost and his accusation is Hamlet’s hallucinatory delusion, a psychosexual projection of his own disgust? There’s a rigorous chill to this Hamlet.Hamlet is out on 6 February in the UK and on 10 April in the US.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsWilliam ShakespeareHamletRiz AhmedTimothy SpallMorfydd ClarkreviewsShareReuse this content"

So here goes …The Smashing MachineView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Everett/ShutterstockIt was Safdie versus Safdie this past autumn with the directing duo splitting to do their own thing even if their own thing ended up being kind of loosely the same. The brothers both picked to make a sports biopic just not in the way many of us traditionally expect – A24-released, focused on a figure many of us don’t know, more vibes than arc-led – and it seemed like Benny might have the more obvious awards play with The Smashing Machine. He had a Hollywood heavyweight in Dwayne Johnson doing the serious transformative thing the Academy have long loved, he had Oscar nomineeEmily Bluntin support and a big Venice film festival premiere complete with a 15-minute standing ovation and a leading man in tears. But the film was a little too inside baseball, not just for the public (it staggered to a puny $21m global gross) but for critics and voters who brushed it aside for Josh’s still unconventional but far more grabby Marty Supreme. Johnson will return in Jumanji 3.The Smashing Machine reviewAfter the HuntView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Amazon Content Services LLC/PAAfter both Challengers and Queer failed to seduce enough of the Academy, it seemed like director Luca Guadagnino would be on safer ground with After the Hunt, an older-skewing, campus-set drama about a #MeToo fallout. Weinstein reportage drama She Said might not have set the Oscars alight but this one was led by Oscar-winning American sweetheart Julia Roberts, supported by Oscar nomineeAndrew Garfieldand The Bear’s awards magnet Ayo Edebiri. It also had a Venice premiere, and with its provocative subject matter there was an expectation of impassioned debate on the ground. Sadly the main question being asked was less how could she/he? and more huh? The film dropped out of the race almost immediately, an equally unimpressed audience greeting its New York film festival premiere before audiences showed zero interest in getting involved (the $80m production couldn’t even make it to $10m worldwide). Roberts might have scored a Golden Globe nod but her Oscar chances were dead in the water and Guadagnino remains out in the cold for the Academy.After the Hunt reviewA House of DynamiteView image in fullscreenPhotograph: NetflixIf the majority of reactions from Venice were to be believed,Kathryn Bigelowhad another slam-dunk on her hands with clammy nuclear weapon thriller A House of Dynamite. It was showered with praise and seemed like Netflix’s surest awards play given the director’s history with the Academy, winning an Oscar for The Hurt Locker before Zero Dark Thirty received five nods. But then it landed at the New York film festival with a thud, a notorious press screening that led to laughs and groans and suddenly its chances started to fade. It eventually had a similar reaction on Netflix, baffling those who bothered to watch the whole thing, and the streamer’s overall campaign strategy started to de-prioritise the film which deservedly ended up with zero nominations.A House of Dynamite reviewDeliver Mefrom NowhereView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Macall Polay/PAThis should have been one of the easier wins of the season – or at least nominations. A Bruce Springsteen biopic made by a director who previously led an actor to a win (Jeff Bridges for Crazy Heart) starring someone with a history of impressing awards bodies (The Bear’s Jeremy Allen White) released the year after another drama about an older musician was a critical and commercial success (A Complete Unknown) pushed by the same studio (Disney) and launched at a prestige festival (Telluride). So how did Deliver Me from Nowhere fail? The film, later given the panicked IP-aware retitle of Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere received polite reviews upon its premiere, polite enough to suggest White would be in the race but it fell fast, never giving fans enough of what they wanted (it made a shocking $22m in the US, over $50m less than the Dylan biopic) while also failing to transcend well-known formula. In a year that saw initial best actor predictions revised right after the fall festivals, this was one of the more surprising misses.Deliver Me from Nowhere reviewChristyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Eddy Chen/Black BearIn the overly schematic strategy of Sydney Sweeney’s career, a film like Christy made perfect sense. The Euphoria breakout had graduated to small, well-reviewed proof-of-talent drama Reality to glossy romcom Anyone But You to final girl horror Immaculate and inevitably, an awards play was next. Christy managed to tick a number of go-to boxes – true story, de-glammed transformation, boxing – and after a fall festival premiere was set, at the more commercially leaning Toronto, and with a best actress category that was, at that stage, lacking in surefire contenders, it seemed like a win for Sweeney (and after that American Eagle ad, she really needed one). Some initially, over-excitedly, labeled her a contender but the film was a box office disaster, one for the history books, and with some middling reviews, she couldn’t even score a nod at the more celeb-thirsty Golden Globes. As the best actress race became more competitive, she become a distant outsider.Christy reviewJay KellyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: BFA/AlamyWhile The Squid and the Whale might have scored Noah Baumbach an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay, the writer-director did not make for an obvious Academy darling. His following films Margot and the Wedding and Greenberg, which found him at his most sour, pushed him even further away and it took his most personal film, and arguably his best, Marriage Story, to suddenly turn him into a real Oscar favourite. The film was nominated for six, winning one for Laura Dern, and while White Noise might have landed with a thud, Baumbach was nominated once again for his Barbie screenplay with Greta Gerwig. Jay Kelly, with a starry cast led by George Clooney, film industry plotline and splashy Venice premiere, seemed like it could help Baumbach get his first Oscar and maybe Adam Sandler his first. But reviews were mixed with some more scalding (the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw opted forone star) and the Clooney comeback narrative folded, a film of old-fashioned American sentimentality that failed to impress the new, more international Academy.Jay Kelly reviewWicked: For GoodView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Universal Pictures/APWhile Wicked might not have swept the board last year in the way that many ardent fans had hoped, the coulda-gone-either-way big bet was still a major contender, nabbing two wins and another eight nominations. It was naturally assumed that the follow-up, released a year after, would do the same and even after reviews were less enthused, downgraded expectations still had experts predictingAriana Grandewould secure her second best supporting actress nod in a row along with recognition in a ton of craft categories. But the film was entirely shut out, a staggeringly precipitous fall that had some questioning whether releasing the films so close together was such a great idea after all (the sequel was also down $250m on the original’s global box office). It was in some ways reassuring, voters refusing to automatically, and lazily, put a lesser sequel on the ballot just because (there was also a 22% drop on Rotten Tomatoes), allowing for some less by-the-book picks instead.Wicked: For Good reviewThe Ballad of a Small PlayerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: APNo one quite saw Edward Berger’s All Quiet on the Western Front coming. The third adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel was given a quiet Toronto premiere from Netflix in 2022 and in its awards campaigning that year, the film was de-prioritised in favour of The Good Nurse, White Noise and Blonde. But it slowly became their safest bet with 14 Bafta noms and nine at the Oscars (it ended up winning four). Berger became an in-demand director and all eyes were on his adaptation of Robert Harris’s papal thriller Conclave. But again no one expected that to be the force it ended up becoming, making $128m globally and garnering eight Oscar noms (it won one for best adapted screenplay). Could he make it three for three with The Ballad of a Small Player? Despite everything in place – Oscar nominee Colin Farrell, Oscar winnerTilda Swinton, Telluride premiere – the film just didn’t connect – too flashy, too loud, too messy – and almost immediately became a low priority for Netflix and voting bodies.The Ballad of a Small Player reviewIs This Thing On?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Searchlight Pictures/PAWhenBradley Cooperfirst broke out, even his most supportive family members could not have predicted that the guy who mostly played jockish dudebros would become a 12-time Oscar-nominated actor-writer-producer-director. His directorial debut A Star Is Born was a $436m-grossing award-winning smash and even if his follow-up Maestro didn’t find as many fans, it still received seven Oscar nods and it seemed like whatever he went on to make would automatically be in the conversation. Except no one ended up saying much about his smaller-scale third film, divorce comedy drama Is This Thing On? which premiered at the New York film festival and couldn’t make enough noise at a time when the race was seeming to firm up. It was lost within the fall festival circuit before it was lost within the December stampede of qualifying releases, another tough break for Searchlight, which couldn’t find love for this, The Testament of Ann Lee or …Is This Thing On? reviewRental FamilyView image in fullscreenRental FamilyPhotograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyThe Brendan Fraser comeback narrative was powerful enough in 2023 to score the actor his first Oscar for a film that was otherwise deemed a bit of a disaster. The Whale, a film the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw generouslycalled“vapid, hammy and stagey”, gave Fraser an Academy-friendly transformation and his off-screen story was persuasive enough, although his inevitable Oscar-primed follow-up couldn’t quite make the distance. Rental Family, which premiered at Toronto, was a more obviously feelgood story and actually scored better reviews than The Whale, but in a best actor category that was becoming increasingly competitive, Fraser – like Clooney, Johnson, White and Farrell – was another well-known name who didn’t feel like an indispensable part of the race.Rental Family reviewExplore more on these topicsOscarsOscars 2026George ClooneyDwayne JohnsonJulia RobertsNoah BaumbachEmily BluntfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Forced together by the death of their mother, they each have a child’s neediness. They are divided, however, over what – or whom – it is they need.What Teresa, the eldest, needs is respect for her devotion, especially as the primary carer in their mother’s final days of dementia. Played by Victoria Brazier, austere and brittle, she is trapped in a narrative of martyrdom, a woman forever convinced she is second-best and overlooked.As the baby of the family, 33-year-old Catherine is in permanent need of coddling. Played by Helen Flanagan, babbling and self-absorbed, she is hungry for reassurance – about her looks, her health and her desirability.Then in the middle, and at the play’s centre, 39-year-old Mary needs to be understood. Played by Polly Lister, wise and yet vulnerable, she is the clever high-flyer, the one who became a doctor, receiving admiration, yearning for love.View image in fullscreenHaunting the family home … Vicky Binns as Vi.Photograph: Pamela RaithThese unrequited desires are focused on the same woman and Stephenson has the good sense to bring her back to life. Played by Vicky Binns, Vi haunts the family home with needs of her own, not least the need to be valued by her daughters. In a play about memory, she has quite a different account of the past from their self-justifying childhood tales.Like the patient in Mary’s care, a young man rebuilding his history after suffering post-traumatic amnesia, the daughters have constructed their memories in a way that suits them. The play is not sentimental about Vi’s death – it is too blackly funny for that – but it does show that, in her absence, with none of the old grievances to fall back on, the sisters must now endure the pain of redefining themselves.These themes keep The Memory of Water from sinking into sitcom blandness, a bulwark to resist the pull of low-stakes character comedy. But even if the play is more cosy than explosive, lacking a big dramatic moment around which the ideas could coalesce, in Lotte Wakeham’s well-acted production, a collaboration with the Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse, the to and fro of emotions has a reflective, bittersweet appeal.AtOctagon, Bolton, until 21 February; thenEveryman, Liverpool, 25 February to 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

There is one at the centre of this play, too, about the power struggle and culture clash in a mixed Cypriot-British family after its patriarch dies.In 2009, in Nicosia, Aristeia (Lucy Christofi Christy) insists her late brother be buried in the Cypriot mountains, in a practice that goes back generations. But his British wife, Jennifer (Ruth Lass), demands her late husband’s body be taken to England, as was his dying wish, she claims. So Aristeia’s keen sense of sacred tradition is pitted against Jennifer’s arguments on freedom from a cultural rite that her husband did not value. Both attempt to reel in the younger generation: Jennifer’s daughter, Penelope (Han-Roze Adonis), and Aristeia’s niece, Xenya (Chrisanthi Livadiotis).The backdrop features a more public sacrilege – the interred body of the former president, Tassos Papadopoulos, has been stolen, we hear. The legacy of British colonial rule also hovers between the warring women.It has the makings of a highly charged drama, with echoes of Antigone and a face-off between Jennifer and Aristeia as the last will and testament is read out. But it does not quite work out that way. De Voni’s debut play has ambition and weaves big, original ideas together around our ownership of the dead and the intersection of belonging, culture and the land. But you do not feel the force of these ideas, and the characters are flimsily built. Some are barely there, such as Jennifer’s second husband, Dominic (Sam Cox), who is little more than a vehicle of the plot.Meanwhile, Penelope carries echoes of Odysseus’s patient wife, left behind for his adventures. She feels her own sense of parental abandonment and it slowly becomes her story, along with that of her mother’s responsibility and guilt, but you never feel as much for her, or any of the characters, as you should.The Rat Trap review – teenage Noël Coward’s jaundiced marital portraitRead moreDirected by Kerry Kyriacos Michael on Cory Shipp’s stark traverse stage set, some scenes are effective, particularly the clashes between mother and daughter, and Jennifer and Dominic’s discussions about love, death and togetherness. And there are some deftly written scenes, full of complicated emotion, but the actors do not quite do them justice.Soupy musical interventions do not help, bluntly dictating mood changes to give the drama the sound of a TV melodrama. Where this play excels is in the smooth tying of the ancient and modern. It is a shame it feels so static and ponderous, too much a discussion of ideas. At over two hours, the play’s promise and potency are ultimately dragged down by its pace.AtTheatro Technis, London, until 22 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

It doesn’t quite cover it. Often regarded as his finest, Arcadia is about life, the universe and everything, to borrow a phrase.It takes place in a single room, across time, alternately filled with a 19th-century past and a parallel setting in the 1980s. Director Carrie Cracknell suggests these worlds are a hair’s-breadth away from an encounter, virtually brushing past each other as they go. It opens with teenage prodigy Thomasina Coverly (Isis Hainsworth) conversing amicably with her tutor Septimus Hodge (Seamus Dillane). The ping-pong of their dialogue is amusing but heartfelt. The mysteries of the world that Thomasina seeks to solve through algebraic equation are accompanied by a slow flirtation between them and the romance that grows is tender, sparky and moving.Their scenes are set beside academics in the play’s present-day, hunting for Thomasina’s lost story and a strand involving the roguish Romantic Lord Byron, as well as the estate’s unknown 19th-century hermit.View image in fullscreenEveryone here is so clever … Holly Godliman, William Lawlor and Angus Cooper.Photograph: Manuel HarlanStoppard, in the same interview, spoke about the sense of a detective story at play in Arcadia and Cracknell’s production carries a lovely searching quality so it seems like a twist on the country-house drama with cerebral intrigues and intellectual piques – even if the story builds towards a conclusion that never arrives.There is an off-stage garden that insinuates itself in the room and the off-stage figure of Byron too, never seen but often referred to in connection with a stinking literary review, a duel and subsequent disappearance.Alex Eales’ elegant set turns the single room into a galaxy with overhanging planetary ellipses and oversized atoms. Staged with a barely perceptible revolve, its movement seems to mimic the turning of the Earth in miniature. Characters discuss thermodynamics, Euclidian geometry, poetry versus science, the algebra of a leaf, and so on. These ideas glimmer like conceptual holograms, wavering before you, just out of reach. Actors bring even the most arcane lines to life with a spirit of playful romance between them.This is a drama about knowledge, and hermeneutics, in which some of its science feels just beyond your understanding. Rather than raising frustration, the unknown languages of Newtonian physics and mathematics gleam with the sense of a playwright tossing about complex ideas with such excitement, dexterity and depth that it doesn’t matter whether you understand them.Joe Wright on Tom Stoppard: ‘He loved sweets, smoking, words and women – in the reverse order’Read moreOr up to a point, at least. Everyone here is so clever, from the winningly precocious Thomasina to Stoppard himself that it can make your head hurt with its abstraction, intelligence and cerebral intensity.The present-day scenario is weaker in its drama and more glib by contrast. “This is not science, this is storytelling,” says Septimus, but it does not always feel that way in these scenes. They stall the pace of the play, which stands still as characters talk out ideas on scholarship. There is not the same tender chemistry in the modern world of academic jousting and flirtation either, despite (or maybe because of) the crass passes made by bombastic scholar Bernard Nightingale (Prasanna Puwanarajah) on star academic Hannah Jarvis (Leila Farzad). Worse are his jokey put downs: “silly bitch” and “silly cow”.This aside, the production has an inbuilt exuberance and is invigoratingly realised. It’s like a complicated piece of algebra, exquisite in its difficulties, unsolvable to the end.At theOld Vic, London, until 21 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageTom StoppardTheatreOld Vic TheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

They wanted to record their debut album, 2023’s I’ve Seen a Way, in a Peak District cave known as the Devil’s Arse, although budget restrictions meant they had to settle for one day in Somerset’s Wookey Hole caverns. The Manchester/Berlin-based four-piece’s new album, Urgh, was written in what they’ve called “an intense residency at an eerie studio house” near Leeds; at the time, singer Valentine Caulfield and drummer Alex Macdougall were both undergoing multiple rounds of surgery. Given the industrial, siren-like intensity of their music, in which Caulfield chants about personal and societal horrors in her native French, impounding themselves in such a place might have seemed unnecessarily masochistic.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for UrghMandy, Indiana seem to feel a moral imperative to embrace extremes. Caulfield has often reiterated her (accurate) stance that “if you’re not angry, then you’re not paying attention”; her incantatory lyrics to new song Dodecahedron indict complacency in the face of a burning world. Given the grievous state of things, the band’s short-circuiting assault may hold about as much appeal for some listeners as sticking your fingers in a live socket – but for those inclined to catharsis, they also fully understand the imperative to push beyond merely observing injustice to viscerally embody its head-spinning force. Otherwise, what’s the point?That instinct places them alongside Model/Actriz, YHWH Nailgun, Moin, Kim Gordon and Gilla Band, the latter arguably the forebears of all this. (The band’s Daniel Fox mixed Mandy, Indiana’s debut and co-produced Urgh.) Each of these acts has disassembled rock down to its mechanical bones, Frankenstein-ing it with the DNA of techno and trap to make it seem shockingly new. In this grimy, purgative company, where everyone is mutating in a different enough direction for each act to remain compelling, Mandy, Indiana’s distinctiveness comes from their limber rhythms. Powered by Macdougall’s incredible versatility and Caulfield’s staccato delivery, many of their songs are alive with an addictively free, bodily lope, which is often stalled by squalling winds and thrashing noise: threat lurking around every corner.Mandy, Indiana: Sicko! ft Billy Woods – videoUrgh, their first album for Sacred Bones, has a few obvious differences from their debut: Cursive’s percussive churn redirects into rudimentary electro appealingly reminiscent of Paul Hardcastle’s 19, and US rapper and kindred spirit Billy Woods adds guest verses to Sicko!, sounding typically unruffled as the track lurches queasily between gargled fuzz and pointillist artillery fire. But the main evolution is into a harder, thicker sound, a contrast of extreme physicality and hyper-detailing that feels like getting dragged under by a strong wave and marvelling at the flotsam caught up in its swell.It’s impressively hard to tell where guitarist Scott Fair ends and synth player Simon Catling begins. Magazine’s ferocious peak hits like a pile-driver that pauses to recharge only to renew its obliterating attack, while Macdougall’s drumming evokes shuddering glass jars one minute, booming Japanese taiko drums the next. Standout Ist Halt So (the shrugging German phrase meaning “that’s just how it is”) seems to pack about four different movements into as many minutes – taunting, staticky, howling, blizzard-like chill – and has a Nine Inch Nails-worthy way with making the mechanical sleazy and earwormy, to disgusting, brilliant ends.Gilla Band on their nightmarish new noise album: ‘Reality gets distorted in a dream’Read moreCaulfield has said that she enjoys that most listeners don’t understand her lyrics; that non-Francophones’ conception of the language as beautiful means she can, as on early single Nike of Samothrace, sneak in lines about stabbing rapists. “I’m trying to pass my intentions to you in the way that I perform and in the way that I use those words, and let’s see if you can get some of it,” she has said. Whatever your Duolingo level, there’s no mistaking the impression of someone feeling trapped amid the smashed mirror sounds and ricocheting percussion of Try Saying, a song about wishing for a life of ease. A Brighter Tomorrow weds a slow siren to a heavy slither of bass, creating a suffocating effect even before you realise Caulfield, at a disembodied remove, appears to be singing about a faltering real-time effort to process sexual assault.For the final song, I’ll Ask Her, Caulfield sings in English for the first time, evidently intent on being heard as widely as possible: “They’re all fucking crazy, man,” she repeats in a frenzy, between convincingly parroting the way men casually dismiss sexual assault allegations against their mates. Laced with dogs barking, incredible splintered sound design and an angle grinder’s unrelenting moan, it overheats until it sounds like a panic attack.#MeToo is vanishing in culture’s rear window, and in turn songs explicitly confronting rape culture have become less headline-grabbing. You think ofDominique Pelicotand former Conservative councillorPhilip Young– who spent years drugging and raping their wives – and of every scumbag with an Epstein island stamp in their passport, of the bros watching each other’s backs closer to home, and remember that it feels extremely good to hear someone raging about this like the emergency it still is.This week Laura listened toRolling BlackoutsCoastal Fever – Sunburned in LondonLove, disconnection and the shadow of colonialism weave around each other in the Melbourne band’s return, the beauty of it being how lightly they weigh those subjects amid a perfect slice of Aussie indie.Explore more on these topicsMusicExperimental musicIndiereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the best coffee place.I likePanificio Storico Vailation Via Vitruvio because the pastries are lovely, and it’s welcoming and warm – they treat you as if they’ve known you for the last 30 years.Pizzeria da Mimmonear Chinatown has a special place in my heart because my parents always used to take us there for lunch. It’s a very small place and the pizza slices are very thick, soft and fluffy, like a cloud. Every time I go there, I feel like a kid again.When I was a student, studying at the Politecnico di Milano, I would go to Grano e Caffè in Viale Romagna, where the food is very cheap and very fresh. If I want to treat myself I go toRatanàon Via Gaetano de Castillia, it’s the restaurant of my friend and chef Cesare Battisti. It has traditional dishes likemondeghili, a type of fried meatball made of leftovers, and I think it does the best risotto in town. I also love a Vietnamese restaurant calledVietnam Mon Amour, where I used to go as a student. It’s tiny and the food is amazing.NeighbourhoodView image in fullscreenSimone shopping in Milan’s Chinatown.Photograph: Laura CoffeyVia Paolo Sarpi, in Chinatown is a must, and comes alive at night. There are so many places to eat – restaurants as well as amazing street food places. There are a few karaoke places too – it’s fun to go with your friends and just sing and make a fool out of yourself.FashionMilan is the city of Armani, and there is so much of Giorgio’s legacy here. It’s an incredible honour to have developed a race suit with them. When Giorgio passed away, I went to the funeral and the queue of people there to say goodbye was kilometres long. That showed how much people love him and how his legacy affected this city.InspirationView image in fullscreenSimone finds visits to Milan’s old aquarium fascinating.Photograph: PhotoFires/AlamyTheAcquario Civico di Milano, one of the oldest aquariums in Europe, was built in the early 20th century. There are sculptures of the sea and fish around the building. Part of the aquarium is outside, with freshwater fish; most of the displays are dedicated to Italian aquatic environments, though inside there’s a little tropical aquarium too. What I love about water is the sense of freedom it gives me, because obviously, for a person with a disability, I’m very clumsy and not very graceful on land – but in the water, I’m fast and can be agile. It feels almost like flying. I could stay for hours just watching a fish swim in an aquarium, it’s mesmerising. I have this passion that I can’t really express in words about swimming creatures, they give me a kind of peace.Green spaceMilan is full of little green parks, butParco Sempioneis one of the best and it’s connected to the medieval Castello Sforzesco, the triumphal arch Arco della Pace and the excellentMuseum of Triennale. It has so many cool events - live music, concerts, exhibitions – they aredisplaying original Olympic postersuntil 15 March.AccessibilityMost of the time, Milan is an accessible city. It’s flat, and with the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games, there have been many renovations in the city. For example, they’ve finally built an elevator at the metro stop in front of my house. But obviously we cannot stop here and we need to always improve because like every part of Italy, Milan is full old buildings that need to be made more accessible.CultureView image in fullscreenMaurizio Cattelan’s L.O.V.E. artwork outside Milan’s stock exchange.Photograph: Eden Breitz/AlamyObviously, Milan is well known for its culture and museums but there are plenty of hidden gems, too. One of them is the L.O.V.E. statue by Maurizio Cattelan, a contemporary visual artist. This statue in front of Milan’s stock exchange is a giant middle finger, and not many tourists go to see it. It’s interesting: it’s made of marble but is so different to classical buildings. It’s as if it’s saying, “screw you” to the Milan stock exchange building, which was built during theVentennio(Italy’s fascist dictatorship).There are many other museums that I love, such as theMudec, the Museum of the Cultures of Milan. TheMuseum of Natural Historyis tiny but it’s in a beautiful building in a beautiful park. At the weekend it’s crowded with kids. I used to be one of those kids, I’d go there all the time. Outside they have lifesize models of dinosaurs. It’s amazing to think they used to roam on the land that became Milan back in the day.Laura Coffey was a guest ofCrowne Plaza Milan CityandYesMilanoExplore more on these topicsMilan holidaysA local's guideItaly holidaysFood and drinkCity breaksEurope holidaysWinter sports holidaysShort breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You may well have lamented this, too, especially if you’ve ever been cornered by an enthusiast at a party. India pale ale (IPA), for example, which was once a distinctly British style of ale designed for export, has, in the hands of American craft brewers, become a sort of standard-bearer forcomplicatedbeer: aggressively hopped, often startlingly bitter and/or sour, and redolent of a bygone era of millennial hipster striving.The very term “craft beer” itself is confusing enough. It was originally used bythe Colorado-based Brewers Associationto denote “small, independent and traditional” breweries, but many of the movement’s trailblazers (Goose IslandandBrooklynto name just two) have since been snapped up by multinationals, while theactualAmerican craft sectordeclined last yeareven as IPA tightened its grip.Still, every trend has its counter-trend and, in retrospect, the moment whenBeavertown Neck Oilbecame available on draught at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium may well have been a turning point. And the unashamedly mass-produced Guinness is famously the order of choice for gen Z. Meanwhile, I’ve noticed a definite uptick in “Erm ... lager?” when ordering rounds with my friends (often accompanied by complaints about the dire effects of IPAs on the middle-aged stomach).There’s also a subset of British brewers who are pushing to make beer, well, beer again. “You can now see these American-style IPAs in every pub around the country,” says Adrian Peskin ofWoodshedding Breweryin Shepton Mallet, Somerset. “So, the craftiest thing you can do now is to turn 180 and go back to where it was before.” Peskin, who is of dual English-German heritage, typifies this new generation. He runs a genuinely small operation out of an old milk barn where he concentrates on “simple beers from complex soil”– old-world styles that have either been neglected or forgotten. Among his beers isStubn, a rich, ruby alt beer, a style popular in Düsseldorf before Bavarian-style lager came to dominate; he also champions the slept-on British beer styles made “since for ever” by medium-sized regional breweries such asTimothy Taylor’sin West Yorkshire andHarvey’sin East Sussex.Peskin reckons it’s also about appreciating beer’s role in society: “The craft beer movement really shifted the focus on to the beer itself,” he says, “whereas, traditionally, beer was more like a conduit for other stuff – good chat, gathering people together. It was never meant to be as divisive as it’s become.” Amen to that!Four old world classicsEcks Victorian Mild Ale£28.80 (6 x 440ml cans) woodsheddingbrew.com, 5.7%.

In the small kitchen is Leonardo Cioni, a tall chef from San Giovanni Valdarno, midway between Florence and Arezzo, who, for the past three-and-a-half years, has run box 37 asSicché Roba Toscana, which roughly translates as “therefore Tuscan stuff”. The escaping steam is effective advertising, leading eyes to the blackboard above the counter to discover exactly what is going on in the back.Always on the menu islampredotto. The fourth stomach of the cow and the most tender, delicate tripe, lampredotto looks like a damp dishcloth crossed with a heavily ruffled shirt. It is prepared by simmering it in broth made from onion, carrot, celery, tomatoes, parsley and basil for about an hour and a half, then seasoned with salt and pepper, and served in a roll, maybe with a spoonful of salsa verde. Also made daily by Leo, and many times over, are trays oftorta di ceci, a baked chickpea flour pancake much like farinata that is sandwiched in a flatbread calledschiaccia, which can also be filled with salumi or cheese. The rest of the menu changes daily, but always includes a bean dish, at least one legume and vegetable soup (often thickened with polenta or bread), some sort of long-braised stew and maybe a ragu.It was the steam fromragu dicapocollothat caught my attention a couple of months ago. So much so that we, Bisto kids in middle-aged bodies, returned an hour and a half later and sat at the multicoloured tiled counter to order it: dense, succulent and with a red-tinted, oily halo, and served on small potato gnocchi.Capocollo (pork neck), which is also known as pork collar or pork neck fillet, comes from the upper part of the pig’s shoulder, an area naturally and generously marbled with fat. It is this marbled combination of flesh and fat that contributes to the succulence of this particular ragu, as well as to the ragu’s ability not only to stand up to but to benefit from three powerful herbs: bay, sage and rosemary. What also struck me about Leo’s version is that he uses minced capocollo, as opposed to braising a whole joint then shredding the meat at the end – which is also great, but I prefer the texture that mince produces. Alternatively, you could mix leaner cuts with back bacon – the key is a generous amount of fat.Pork ragu with herbs (for gnocchi or pasta)Serves4400gpork mince, ideally well-marbled with fat, so neck, shoulder or jowl)3-4 tbspolive oil1 medium onion, or three shallots, peeled and finely diced2 bay leaves2 sage leaves2 sprigs of rosemary; 1 leaves picked and minced, 1 left wholeSalt1 small glassdry white wine400g tinplum tomatoes, crushed or passed though a food mill1 tbsptomato concentrate500g potato gnocchi, or fresh pappardelleGrated parmesan, or grana padanoWorking in a heavy-based pan or casserole on a medium-low heat, fry the minced pork in olive oil, moving it around the pan until it has lost all pinkness. Add the onion, bay, sage, minced and whole rosemary, and a pinch of salt, and continue cooking (and stirring) until the onion is translucent.Add the white wine, leave it to bubble for a minute or two, then add the tinned tomatoes, tomato concentrate, another small pinch of salt and a small glass of warm water. Half-cover the pan with a lid and turn down the heat so the ragu simmers gently for two hours. Check and stir every now and then, adding another small glass of warm water if the contents of the pan seem at all dry. By the end of cooking, the ragu should be dense but succulent with an oily halo.Cook the gnocchi (or pasta) in plenty of well-salted, boiling water, then lift into a warm bowl. Add a spoonful of finely grated parmesan or grana padano, toss, then add half the ragu and toss again. Divide between four plates or shallow bowls and top with more ragu and more cheese, if you wish.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkMain coursePastaPorkMeatVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

For our four-year-old goddaughter, it is always that time of year. Just hearing the two words together makes her roll her eyes and roll out her little tongue in anticipation of pleasure, like a cartoon kid. When we told her we would come and bake a chocolate cake with her, there were squeals of joy.Settling on a recipe was the first challenge – Ravneet Gill’sfudgy one, Felicity Cloake’sperfect oneand Benjamina Ebuehi’straybaked onewere all contenders. We eventually landed on Samin Nosrat’s much-loved, tried-and-testedmidnight chocolate cake.It was to be a learning experience for us as much as for her – we never knew that you can make chocolate cake only while wearing a crown. She had to explain this to us at length. The reasoning had something to do with warding off ghosts and crocodiles – or perhaps the crocodiles were warding off the ghosts, and the crowns were for something else.Blueywas involved as well.After donning our crowns and aprons, and setting off to the kitchen, it became very clear who was actually in charge of the process. Heavy is the head that wears the crown, and the girl, who speaks mostly in the imperative, began shooting out instructions with the speed and confidence of a football coach. At one point, we had to cut baking paper to size, then we had to draw dragons on the baking paper, which led to a very serious discussion about which of the dragons was good and which evil, and how many there should be of each, in case we needed to draw more. (The verdict: in life, as in cake, balance matters.)View image in fullscreenHere be dragons … Itamar and Sarit’s godchild takes the lead.Photograph: Itamar SrulovichWhen baking with a child, precision gives way to play, efficiency to imagination. Throwaway moments – lifting a heavy bowl, cracking an egg, sifting cocoa, licking a spoon, placing a cake in the oven – become moments of reverence and revelation. Burying our noses together in the cake fresh out of the oven to breathe in that smell, the anxious anticipation for it to cool so we could decorate it. There is no overstating the importance of sprinkles to the process – here, more is more is more is more, and the merits of each type can be endlessly discussed and compared.Over the next few weeks, we will be baking lots of chocolate cakes, as well asbabkas, heart-shaped cookies and many other sweet romantic treats, and while we have certainly – maybe sadly – outgrown sprinkles, this kitchen experience has been a timely reminder that baking is nothing short of magic.All of this is to explain that if you see us in one of our places carrying a tray of baked goods, we may be wearing paper crowns. Feel free to talk to us about dragons.Our month in foodView image in fullscreenRepeat visit … dosas at Hoppers.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverAn island paradise|Around about this time last year, we were in Sri Lanka, and a chunk of our heart is still there. We were thinking about it when ensconced in the beautiful newHoppersin Shoreditch, where everything – the light filtering through the slatted shutters, the beautiful painted ceiling, the tunes from the speakers, the woven rattan bar and chairs – reminded us of the enchanted isle we love so much. Everything on our table was a perfect balancing act: the potent heat of spice tempered by the richness of slow-cooked meat, seared seafood and fish, flashes of tamarind and guava, chilli-dipped lime … The crab omelette is something we will order every time we come back here, which will be often.An Italian culinary getaway|Our fantasy holiday is something not far off this: an olive grove in Abruzzo, in-depth culinary tours in one of the world’s most beautiful and delicious regions, and two legendary chefs to cook for, and with, us. Rosie Sykes and Barny Haughton are giants of the food world and will take a lead onthis Italian getaway of dreams.The return of Nigella|We are giddy with joy at the news thatNigella is joining The Great British Bake Offteam. She has been off our screen for a criminally long time and Bake Off has been off our radar for years, but suddenly it’s got interesting again.
