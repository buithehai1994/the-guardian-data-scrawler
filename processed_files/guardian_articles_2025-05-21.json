We love you just the way you are. Look on the bright side: it could have been worse. KemiKaze could have used all six of her questions at prime minister’s questions to have re-examined the Tories’ very own rubbish Brexit deal. Just as she had for the previous two days. Mistakenly believing that this time – maybe, this time – she could find the killer line. It would have been too much to expect her to have realised there wasn’t one.But no. Kemi chose to cut her losses. A triumph of sorts. Only the Tory leader then went on to snatch a humiliating defeat when all she had to do was tap the ball into the emptiest of nets.Maybe she’s been taking lessons from the Spurs’ team this season. Please don’t mention the game tonight. Having returned my ticket to the club, I will be watching from behind the back of the sofa. The similarities don’t end there. Just like Big Ange Postecoglou, Kemi could be facing the sack in the near future. Enough is enough.There again, maybe we should be applauding the unorthodox. The politician who breaks the mould of how a leader of the opposition should act. Kemi does things her own way. No one can teach her a thing. And God knows they have tried. But maybe you just have to sit back and applaud.It takes a certain level of genius to be this abject. This hopeless. Especially when time and again you are the only person alive to think you have aced it. Kemi gets to redefine the word crap. New levels of great rubbishness. And I for one will miss her when she’s gone.Keir Starmer couldn’t have made life any simpler for the Conservative leader. In an answer to a planted question from the Labour backbencher Sarah Owen, Keir made the loudest ofU-turns on winter fuel allowance paymentsright at the start of PMQs. Not that he called it a U-turn. More a totally planned change of heart, despite the fact he had spent much of the previous few months denying he had any intention of reversing the previous budget.It was like this, he mumbled. Not even he believed what he was about to say. Just concentrate on getting the words out of his mouth in more or less the right order. Try not to think that the whole world might be thinking: “This must be a massive embarrassment for the government.”So on he went. The economy was now in tip-top shape – don’t mention the inflation rate – so he had a bit more leeway. Time toincrease the threshold at which WFA could be claimed. Absolutely nothing to do with the fact that Labour backbenchers were kicking up rough and threatening the mother of all rebellions. Heaven forbid. Keir took a deep breath, thankful to have got the hard part over and done with. Just the pushback to deal with. Thirty minutes of eating shit.Only the shit never came. Either Kemi hadn’t been listening or she reckoned that what Starmer had just said was no big deal. As if a U-turn was an everyday event. Yawn. Nothing to see here. The Tory backbenchers clasped their heads in their hands as KemiKaze stuck to her prepared script. When all she had to do was to tear up her notes and stick the knife into Starmer for 10 minutes. Wins wouldn’t have come any easier than that. Or sweeter.Kemi began wittering vaguely about the economy and Starmer couldn’t believe his luck. He’d never imagined life could be quite this good. You spend your life wondering whether you are up to the job and are handed an opposition leader whose mission is to validate you. Kemi: The Accidental Therapist. Keir just went straight to default random answer one. Stop talking the country down. Everything was much better than it had been.That all wasted a good five minutes or so. Halfway and no harm done to Keir. Then KemiKaze disappeared down the rabbit hole of the Telegraph front page which had revealed Angela Rayner had tried to get the chancellor to raise taxes on the wealthy. Starmer had to gently explain to her that Rayner’s taxes had not been implemented. Thinking something didn’t turn it into a reality. How could he put this nicely? The taxes he had raised were the taxes he had raised. Clear enough? Apparently not.It took a rather desperate Chris Philp – is there another sort of Philpster? – to get Kemi’s attention. Had she noticed the prime minister had just done a major U-turn? “Shut up,” Kemi hissed. She was concentrating on not listening. But really, the Nose in Search of a Bum pleaded. Just ask. So she did. “Are you really planning to U-turn on WFA?” she asked, incredulously. Keir hummed. Er … Let’s put this into words of one syllable. It’s a small change. Not a U-turn.“I’m making this really easy for you,” KemiKaze said. She wasn’t wrong. She couldn’t have been more accommodating toLabourif she tried. The government’s sweetheart. “Just look at the faces of the Labour backbenches,” she added.Cue a break for two minutes’ laughter. Because the Labour MPs were ecstatic. They had got what they wanted. A climbdown on the WFA. Three trade deals in the bag. Something half decent to say to their constituents when they went home for the bank holiday weekend. It was the Tory benches where you could find total misery. A leader who had yet again let them down. Deprived them of their weekly happiness allowance once more. All that awaited them was more pain. Existential despair.You could tell just how bad it was, because well before the end ofPMQsthe Tory press office had sent out a panicky WhatsApp to journalists. None of what we had seen with our own eyes had really happened. Kemi had absolutely aced it. She hadn’t missed the U-turn. Had just been waiting for the right moment. Everything was terrific. Kemi Rules OK! Long may she reign.Explore more on these topicsPMQsThe politics sketchKeir StarmerKemi BadenochBenefitsConservativesLabourHouse of CommonscommentShareReuse this content"

For that, concrete action on sanctions and Palestinian statehood is requiredSanam Vakil is director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa programmeWed 21 May 2025 09.20 EDTLast modified on Wed 21 May 2025 14.09 EDTShareNineteen months on from the 7 October Hamas attacks and the war in Gaza, Israel is under a new wave of international pressure and increasingly isolated from its partners and allies. Benjamin Netanyahu’s government recently announced its intention to reoccupy Gaza yet again, and called up Israeli reservists. In tandem, the illegal expansion of settlements and violence in the West Bank continues unabated. And as part of a tactic to bring pressure to bear on Hamas to release the remaining hostages held in Gaza, Israelhalted the delivery of humanitarian aidinto Gaza for two months, leading to widespread starvation and brutal conditions.In reaction, the UK, France and Canada issued a joint statement expressing a strong rebuke of Israel’s war effort. The UK’s foreign secretary, David Lammy, also announced afreeze on trade discussionswith Israel, and the imposition of sanctions on settlers and organisations involved in West Bank violence. This reproach followed the Dutch foreign minister’s call to review theEU-Israel association agreement. The move, supported by a large number of EU states, criticised Israel’s conduct of war and could lead to sanctions. Spain’s prime minister went even further, calling Israel agenocidal state. Strikingly, even the staunchly pro-Israeli Trump administration is also taking its distance from Netanyahu’s government, with Donald Trump avoiding a stop in Israel on his Middle East tour. The US vice-president, JD Vance, has also chosen to delay a visit to Israel, suggesting that the administration wants to dissociate itself from the optics of this unending war.The growing chorus of international condemnation reflects a decisive shift in global attitudes, but without more stringent efforts – including further sanctions, external steps to recognise Palestinian statehood and greater alignment by Israel’s opposition – it is unlikely that Netanyahu and his rightwing coalition will be derailed from their military campaign against Hamas and territorial expansionist plans.Netanyahu is certainly caught between growing domestic and international pressure, but as of now neither is sufficient to force a change in course or calculus. His coalition of rightwing partners continue to see the war in Gaza as an opportunity under the guise of national security to expand Israel’s territorial claims. Netanyahu himself, seeking to stay in power through 2026, has lashed out against Europe and the UK,arguingthat Israel is at the helm of a fight between “civilisation and barbarism”.EU to review trade relations with Israel over ‘untenable’ situation in Gaza, says top diplomat – as it happenedRead moreInside Israel opposition is mounting. The continued captivity of Israeli hostages in Gaza has triggered mass protests, with families and civil society groups demanding immediate action. Polls show that67% of Israeliswant an end to the conflict and the hostages brought home. Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s push for controversial judicial reforms has reignited protests over what many view as an erosion of democratic checks and balances. His attempt todismissthe Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar prompted a rare legal confrontation, with the supreme court stepping in, showcasing tensions between the government and the security establishment. Political challengers such as the former prime minister, Naftali Bennett, and the Democratic party leader, Yair Golan, are gaining momentum among voters disillusioned by the government’s war strategy and domestic agenda. Still, a serious challenge to Netanyahu’s grip on power will require a more unified and future-oriented opposition coalition.An opportunity for further international pressure that moves beyond rhetoric lies ahead. TheSaudi-French conference on Palestineat the UN headquarters in New York next month marks a potentially pivotal moment. The conference aims to reinvigorate multilateral engagement on Palestinian statehood and coordinate international responses to the crisis in Gaza. With148 countrieshaving already recognised Palestine as a state, the event can be a platform for additional countries, particularly those in Europe, to follow suit. France has hinted at the possibility of announcing its recognition of Palestinian statehood during the conference. The UK is also considering supporting this move.Israel-Gaza war live: one-week-old baby amongst 45 people killed in Gaza strikes as UN warns aid still being blockedRead moreSaudi Arabia normalising relations with Israel, which has conventionally been seen as the big incentive to end the war and integrate Israel into the regional neighbourhood, is formallyoff the tableuntil Israel recognises Palestinian statehood. Positioning itself as a leading regional voice, Saudi Arabia is leveraging the multilateral conference to reassert Arab support for a two-state solution. As global frustration with the status quo intensifies, the Saudi-French initiative could signal a shift toward greater diplomatic recognition of Palestinian rights and a renewed push for a negotiated settlement.Israel stands at a crossroads, increasingly isolated on the world stage and facing mounting isolation and internal unrest. Yet, condemnation alone will not alter the trajectory of Netanyahu’s government. What’s needed now is coordinated, strategic external and internal action that can finally force a shift away from endless war and toward a path of accountability, justice and peace.Sanam Vakil is director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa programmeExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionGazaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuDavid LammyMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

But my son’s behaviour was unmanageable. He was violent. He would attack his sister, he would attack me, he attacked his grandmother. He was running away, and I was having to report him as missing – at this point he was only 10 years old,” she said.She adopted two siblings, then aged one and three, in north Derbyshire in 2013 with her former husband. The siblings, who are neurodiverse, came from a traumatic family background and quickly developed challenging behaviour.After years of little support other than “basic parenting courses”, Bristow had to beg social services to accommodate her son, even though medical professionals and the police advised it was the best course of action.“I love my children. I would walk over hot coals for my children and never, ever have I regretted making them my children,” she said. “I can hate some of the things my son has done but I love him. I want him to be a happy adult with a fulfilled existence, surrounded by family and friends that love him. But at the moment, I can’t get him there on my own.”He is now in a residential placement and getting an enhanced level of support. Meanwhile, her younger daughter relies heavily on therapy, funded by the Adoption and Guardian Support Fund, which wascut by 40%per child by the government in April, news Bristow found deeply worrying.“That support has been life saving, and I know that sounds dramatic, but it’s really not. Families are held together by this therapeutic work, it is the glue. The NHS just can’t provide it, so there’s nowhere else to turn,” she said. “There’s a lot of talk about recruiting new adopters and that scares me because thesystem can’t supportthe adopters that are already in existence.“How on earth does anybody think that more families can be supported when the families that are already begging for help can’t get it?”Her experience is not unique. The children’s minister, Janet Daby, recently told parliament that 170 – to 180 adopted children return to the care system each year, although she admitted “the figures are not as robust as we would like them to be”.The subject is still something of a taboo – campaigners and adoptive parents are aware that many people in power are reluctant to highlight an issue that may deter much-needed adoptive parents from coming forward.But parents say there is an unacknowledged crisis of poor post-adoption support, and a lack of oversight in what happens when things go wrong.Many adoptive parents said they had been threatened with prosecution for abandonment, or told they risked their other children being taken into care, when asking for their children to be housed by their local authority.Demand for specialist lawyers is rising, and adoptive parents are more vocally campaigning for better rights and support.Sarah* and her husband adopted a two-year-old boy after she had a hysterectomy in her 20s after struggling with endometriosis.From a young age her son struggled with anger, and began hitting his parents from the age of four. They attended several parenting courses, worked with his school and begged social services for more support.Things deteriorated rapidly after Sarah’s husband died of cancer. “It got way, way worse because I was dealing with it by myself. It was really hard and my mental health started to really take a nosedive,” she said.Her son was eventually diagnosed with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, and as he got older, the violence got worse. “My strongest memory is of lying on my bed and my son literally repeatedly kicking me in the stomach. This was happening on a daily basis and I went to hospital a few times because of my injuries,” she said.“I just got to the point where I had a complete breakdown and said I can’t do this any more. I was a child protection social worker – professional, responsible, well educated. I really researched everything I possibly could to try to help my son. But my life had just changed beyond recognition.”She first applied through section 20 of the Children’s Act for her local authority to temporarily accommodate her son, before a care order was issued, meaning she now shares parental responsibility with them.She said the whole experience was “deeply and painfully traumatic” and has left her feeling suicidal. “At first, they said if I went ahead with it then I could be taken to court for abandonment,” she said. Then, during the court proceedings for the care order, she felt she was blamed for what happened to her son.“I know what kind of parent I’ve been and I know how dedicated I’ve been to my son, and it was almost like none of that counted for anything,” she said.Sarah is part of a group called PATCH (Passionate Adopters Targeting Change with Hope) that has swelled to 1,500 members, who all have similar experiences of poor post-adoption support, in many cases leading to an adoption breakdown.The group’s founder, Fiona Wells, an adopter and social worker, recently wrote to the children’s minister to say that “a 360-degree cycle of unmet need, systemic failure, and significant human cost” was leading to “an increasing number of adopted and post-adopted children returning to care”.The group is calling for “trauma-responsive, recovery-focused planning” that moves away from the “assumption that love is enough” to help adopted children heal.They also want official data to be collected on the number of adoption breakdowns nationwide, a public inquiry into “punitive, blame-based social work practices”, and independent audit panels led by those with lived experience of social care.“The current systemic response to families in crisis – particularly where early life trauma is a factor – is nothing short of scandalous,” Wells said.* Some names have been changed to protect anonymity.Explore more on these topicsAdoptionChildrenMental healthHealthParents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s been 60 years since he first recorded the song on his self-titled debut album, and famously taught it (or tried to teach it) to both Bob Dylan and Paul Simon, when they came to watch the young guitar hero playing in the London folk clubs. Dylan transformed the song into Girl from the North Country, while Simon turned it into Scarborough Fair/Canticle, a hit single for Simon & Garfunkel and the opening track on their 1966 album Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme.Carthy’s new version is onTransform Me Then into a Fish, his first solo album in 21 years, released on his 84th birthday today. It now has sitar backing from Sheema Mukherjee, giving it a mysterious, spooky edge. “That’s the kind of a song it is. Try not to be scared of it,” said Carthy, whose sleeve notes when he first recorded the song provided a reminder that parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme were herbs traditionally associated with death. “It finds a home among the weird, oddball songs. I was interested in what Sheema could do with it, and she responded as a wonderful musician will respond …”He is sitting at his kitchen table in the house in which he has lived for the past 37 years, in Robin Hood’s Bay on the Yorkshire coast, just half an hour’s drive north of Scarborough. It looks like an over-cluttered museum, with every space on the floor, walls or shelves packed with musical instruments, cassettes, pictures, posters and a street sign from Hull, where his wife, thelate Norma Waterson, grew up. He now shares the home with their daughter, the folksinger and fiddle-playerEliza Carthy, her two children, and a cat.View image in fullscreen‘I found myself looking into Dylan’s face’ … Martin Carthy performing at the King & Queen, Foley Street.Photograph: Brian Shuel/RedfernsHe says he has always loved the lyrics of folk songs as much as the melodies, and as he discusses the new album, he delights in telling stories, often illustrated with bursts of song, about the bands and musicians he has played with. Eliza brings in tea, chipping in about lyrics and song titles.The new album started out as a 60thanniversary tribute to his 1965 solo debut, but didn’t quite work out that way. A handful of songs have been dropped, and three new ones added. But eight originals remain, including Scarborough Fair.He remembers exactly where he first heard it – at the Troubadour folk club in Earl’s Court, in 1960, where it was sung byJacqueline McDonald(of the Spinners fame) who told her audience that she had learned it from a new song book, The Singing Island, by Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger. Carthy rushed out to buy it and thought: “That’s a nice tune – and of course it was, because Ewan wrote [this version of] it! He would always improve a tune.”Carthy composed his own arrangement for the song, and was singing it while playing with the Thamesiders at the King & Queen pub, near Goodge Street, when he “found myself looking into Dylan’s face – I had heard about him from Sing Out magazine”. Dylan was there with his legendary manager Albert Grossman, “a folk fan who loved fishing and whaling songs and could sing the pants off anyone, though he never sang in public”.View image in fullscreenMartin Carthy at home in Robins Hoods Bay.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianDylan said he loved Scarborough Fair, and begged Carthy to “teach me that, teach me that”. A few days later he came to watch Carthy playing solo at the Troubadour, and began visiting the house where he was living on Haverstock Hill, near Belsize Park tube.The first visit has become a folk legend. It was during the bitterly cold winter of 1962-3, and one of Carthy’s friends had found an old piano abandoned outside Chalk Farm tube and pushed it up the hill to the house. Carthy started chopping it up with a sword he had been given as a Christmas present, so he could feed it into a wood-burning stove – to Dylan’s fury. “I got the sword and Bob came and stood in front of me and said ‘you can’t do that, man, it’s a musical instrument!’ ‘It’s a piece of junk’, I said, and swung a couple of times. Bob was looking up at me and said ‘could I try?’ – and he battered it … it’s all true!”Dylan failed to master Scarborough Fair. “He wanted to do it with a flat pick though he’s a perfectly good finger-style player,” says Carthy. “He got the giggles all the time and it made him laugh.” So when Dylan later transformed the song into Girl from the North Country, did he mind? “We just swapped songs all the time,” says Carthy. “That’s what people did.”Carthy was less pleased when Paul Simon did not credit him for his arrangement on Simon and Garfunkel’s version, Scarborough Fair/Canticle. But all is now forgiven, with Carthy saying: “It was grossly unfair [of me] because it wasn’t a pinch in any way … it was written as a tribute because he is clever enough to do that.’” They made up by singing the song together on stage at Hammersmith Apollo in October 2000: “He was doing a tour. He said, ‘Really – you want to do that?’ It was important, so I could lay it to rest and never have to sing that song again!”He eventually changed his mind about returning to the song, he said, because “I was gifted a lovely version!” In 2014 he was invited to sing on a TV drama, Remember Me, set in Scarborough and starring Michael Palin. When he went to the recording, he was presented with a very different version of Scarborough Fair, “collected by Cecil Sharpe, fromGoathland– a village near here on the moors”. That’s the one he recorded for the new album and now sings live “but I haven’t got it quite right yet …”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

He tells how he sang High Germany back in 1963 and thought he had remembered the words correctly until he checked the English Folk Music Journal and found that for some verses “the words were nothing like mine – I was highly impressed I had invented this stuff”. He still sings his version. As for his own original version of the Ewan MacColl song Springhill Mine Disaster, The Ballad of Springhill, he says that MacColl, a folk purist, “hated what I did, because I was playing guitar – a foreign body!” On the new version, Carthy is backed only by Eliza’s fiddle and demonstrates his new singing voice. “I lost a lot in the lower registers and found something else – and I like it.”Eliza’s fiddle also provides the new setting for Ye Mariners All, “one of those lovely nonsense songs.” The suitably surreal album cover for Transform Me Then into a Fish shows Martin at the breakfast table in the middle of the ocean, holding his fork like a crazed Neptune.Carthy has always been adventurous. After recording that landmark album in 1965 he worked with fiddler Dave Swarbrick. When Swarbrick joined Fairport Convention in 1969 – an invitation also extended to Carthy, “twice!” – Carthy joined Steeleye Span instead, playing electric guitar, very loudly, saying “do you want me to turn it down to ‘lounge’ – it’s supposed to be loud!”View image in fullscreen‘I thought eventually someone would teach me to sing, and Norma did’ … l to r, Carthy, Norma Waterson, Lal Waterson, Mike Waterson.Photograph: Estate of Keith Morris/RedfernsAfter marrying Norma in 1972 he joined the glorious vocal group the Watersons. “I thought eventually someone would teach me to sing, and Norma did,” he says. He went on to be involved in many different projects, including solo work, playing in duos with Swarbrick and withJohn Kirkpatrickand Eliza, and in groups including Waterson: Carthy (in which he was joined by Norma and Eliza), the brass-backed Brass Monkey, and the gloriously experimentalthe Imagined Village, which reworked traditional songs for a multicultural Britain, and featured a large cast that included Simon Emmerson, Billy Bragg, Benjamin Zephaniah and Mukherjee.“I loved it,” says Carthy. “That huge band was so exciting. Sheema seized everything we tossed at her and she encouraged me to take risks.” With the Imagined Village, he recorded a powerful new treatment of the traditional My Son John in 2010, with sitar backing and updated to the Afghan war era with Carthy’s new lyrics: “Up come John and he’s got no legs, he’s got carbon fibre blades instead.” He startled his followers even more by re-working Slade’s Cum on Feel the Noize: “Because I’m a big fan of Noddy [Holder]. What a singer!”He’s just home from a US tour with Eliza, with shows to celebrate the new album involving both Eliza and Sheema starting on 12 June – while next year promises the return of a new version of the Imagined Village.

The first Celebration Day was held on 26 June 2022, and now it runs on the last bank holiday Monday in May, which this year will be 26 May.Stephen Mangan, Nathaniel Parker and Susan Wokoma were also filmed reading poems at Abbey Road studios in London. The videos will be published exclusively on the Guardian website in the lead up to Celebration Day, with the first, which features Bonham Carter reading Don’t Let That Horse by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, available to watch today.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

They’re just people’Read moreWilfred Owen and Sheenagh Pugh are among the poets whose works were selected by the actors. Jones, known for his roles in Mr Bates vs the Post Office and Detectorists, picked Portrait of a Romantic by ASJ Tessimond, in memory of his father, who died a year after Jones introduced him to the poem.Poems “were like clothing” to his father, said Jones – he “wanted to live inside” them, and memorised a number of them, including Portrait of a Romantic. “We decided to use the second stanza of this poem on his gravestone”, said Jones. “When I read the poem, inevitably I reflect on my Dad, and the huge influence he’s had on both what I do, and how I feel about what I do.”Bonham Carter chose Don’t Let That Horse in memory of her grandmother, who was known as “Bubbles”. A painter who made “sort of fake Chagalls”, Bonham Carter described her grandmother as an “eternal child” who “always had a sense of play”.View image in fullscreen‘An eternal child’ … Helena Bonham Carter holding a picture with her grandmother, Bubbles.Photograph: Rory Langdon-Down“She died at 89, but frankly she never really grew older emotionally than about seven. A good reminder that no matter how serious it gets, you’ve got to remember to have fun.”Lost loved ones “remain part of our fabric, our internal world”, the actor added. “We need permission to stop – a day in which we can invoke them and remember them, and let them live again through us.” After losing somebody, “you might lose what you were when you were with them. And that relationship needs to carry on, somehow”.The actors worked with Esiri, who compiled365 Poems for LifeandA Poem for Every Day of the Year, to choose their poems. Most of us reach for poetry at significant moments in life, like weddings and funerals, because poems “help us express things that most of us find really difficult to express”, said Esiri.The language of poetry “gives you a path when you’re suffering eviscerating feelings of grief and you’ve lost your hold on the earth and everything’s very very fractured”, she added. The “great poet gives you words, and it’s sort of likeholding your hand across time”.Star pin badges will be on sale at WH Smith stores until 27 June, with proceeds going to charities Mind, the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, Make-A-Wish and Hospice UK. The public are encouraged to share memories of loved ones on social media using the hashtag #ShareYourStar.Parker, who directed the videos, said the project “was a genuinely memorable experience”.“Sometimes with a light touch, sometimes deeply moving, they are small, intimate acts of sharing, whether defiant, mournful or inspiring,” he said.Explore more on these topicsBooksPoems to rememberPoetryHelena Bonham CarterStephen ManganToby JonesAsa ButterfieldnewsShareReuse this content"

Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) limit invasive sexual thoughts. Anti-androgens reduce the production of testosterone and limit libido.The drugs are taken alongside psychiatric work that targets other causes of sexual offending, such as a desire for power and control.Mahmood is exploring whether chemical castration could be made mandatory, instead of voluntary, for the most serious offenders, the source said.Sexual offences accounted for 21% of adults serving immediate custodial sentences at the end of March 2025. The report notes that participation in any such programme would be voluntary in England and Wales.Among the main recommendations, Gauke, the former Conservative justice secretary, said the government should:Ensure custodial sentences under 12 months are only used in exceptional circumstances.Extend suspended sentences to up to three years and encourage greater use of deferred sentences for low-risk offenders.Give courts greater flexibility to use fines and ancillary orders like travel, driving and football bans.Allow probation officers to adjust the level of supervision based on risk and compliance with licence conditions.Expand specialist domestic abuse courts to improve support for victims.Expand tagging for all perpetrators of violence against women and girls.Improve training for practitioners and the judiciary on violence against women and girls.Change the statutory purposes of sentencing so judges and magistrates must consider protecting victims as much as they consider punishment and rehabilitation when passing sentences.Gauke has called for the need to increase funding and resources for the probation service, including expanding the availability of electronic monitoring equipment like tags, and warned that there will be a “public backlash” if money is not found.“If probation are left without additional resources then the risk is that we won’t make progress on rehabilitation and there will be a public backlash,” he said.The National Police Chiefs’ Council echoed Gauke’s calls for more resources.Chief constable Sacha Hatchett, national policing lead for criminal justice, said: “Out of prison should not mean out of control. If we are going to have fewer people in prison, we need to ensure that we collectively have the resources and powers to manage the risk offenders pose outside prison.“Adequate funding to support these measures must be reflected in the upcoming spending review, as well as investment in probation services and technology, including electronic monitoring.”Penal reform group the Howard League welcomed the recommendations.Andrea Coomber, the chief executive, said: “The ball is now in the government’s court. Solving the prison capacity crisis will require major intervention and, as the review recognises, this will only succeed if reform and investment deliver an effective and responsive probation service that works to cut crime in the community.”The Conservatives have condemned Gauke’s review. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, said: “By scrapping short prison sentences Starmer is effectively decriminalising crimes like burglary, theft and assault. This is a gift to criminals who will be free to offend with impunity.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

But Ramaphosa – who earlier said that he had come to Washington to “reset” the relationship between the two countries – refused to take the bait and suggested that they “talk about it very calmly”.Trump has long maintained that Afrikaners, a minority descended from mainly Dutch colonists who ruledSouth Africaduring its decades of racial apartheid, are being persecuted. South Africa rejects the allegation. Murder rates are high in the country and the overwhelming majority of victims are Black.What began as a convivial meeting at the White House, including lighthearted quips about golf, took a sudden turn when Ramaphosa told Trump there is no genocide against Afrikaners.Trump said, “We have thousands of stories talking about it,” then ordered his staff: “Turn the lights down and just put this on.”Sitting next to Trump before the fireplace, Ramaphosa forced a smile and turned to look at a big TV screen as Trump’s South Africa-born billionaire ally Elon Musk, JD Vance, the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, and diplomats and journalists from both countries looked on.The video included footage of former South African president Jacob Zuma andfirebrand opposition politician Julius Malemasinging an apartheid-era struggle song calledKill the Boer, which means farmer or Afrikaner, as supporters danced.Ramaphosa quietly but firmly pushed back, pointing out that the views expressed in the video are not government policy.2:47Trump and Ramaphosa have tense White House exchange over false white genocide claims – video reportThere was also footage that Trump claimed showed the graves of more than a thousand white farmers, marked by white crosses. Ramaphosa, who had mostly sat expressionless, occasionally craning his neck to look, said he had not seen that before and would like to find out what the location was.Trump then produced a batch of newspaper articles that he said were from the last few days reporting on killings in South Africa. He read some of the headlines and commented: “Death, death, death, horrible death.”Ramaphosa acknowledged there is crime in South Africa and said the majority of victims were Black. Trump cut him off and said: “The farmers are not Black.”The conspiracy theory of a white genocide has long been a staple of the racist far right, and in recent years has been amplified by Musk and rightwing media personality Tucker Carlson.Trump kept returning to the theme during Wednesday’s televised meeting. He said: “Now I will say, apartheid: terrible. That was the biggest threat. That was reported all the time. This is sort of the opposite of apartheid.“What’s happening now is never reported. Nobody knows about it. All we know is we’re being inundated with people, with white farmers from South Africa, and it’s a big problem.”He added: “They’re white farmers, and they’re fleeing South Africa, and it’s a very sad thing to see. But I hope we can have an explanation of that, because I know you don’t want that.”The white Afrikaners lining up to accept Trump’s offer of asylumRead moreBut Ramaphosa maintained an even tone, observing: “We were taught by Nelson Mandela that whenever there are problems, people need to sit down around the table and talk about them. And this is precisely what we would also like to talk about.”The meeting came days after about50 Afrikaners arrived in the US to take up Trump’s offer of “refuge”. Trump made the offer despite the US having halted arrivals of asylum seekers from most of the rest of the world as he cracks down on immigration.Relations between the countries are at their lowest point since the end of apartheid in 1994. The US has condemned South Africa’s case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza at the international court of justice, slashed aid, announced 31% tariffs andexpelled the South Africa ambassador for criticising Trump’s “Make America great again” (Maga) movement.But the biggest bone of contention has been a South African land-expropriation law signed in January that aims to redress the historical inequalities of white-minority rule. Ramaphosa denied that the law will be used to arbitrarily confiscate white-owned land, insisting that all South Africans are protected by the constitution.But Trump falsely asserted: “You do allow them to take land – and then when they take the land, they kill the white farmer, and when they kill the white farmer, nothing happens to them …“You’re taking people’s land away from them and those people in many cases are being executed. They’re being executed and they happen to be white.”NAACP President Derrick Johnson said of the meeting: “There’s no limit to how far Donald Trump will go to divide people on the basis of race. It’s frankly disgusting to hear the President of the United States — in the Oval Office — promote lies and propaganda. It’s shameful and appalling.”Ramaphosa arrived at the White House with his agriculture minister, John Steenhuisen, who is white,two of South Africa’s top golfers, Ernie Els and Retief Goosen, and the country’s wealthiest person, Johann Rupert, in a bid to woo the golf-loving president. All weighed in during the Oval Office meeting and seemed to be well-received by Trump.Rupert said South Africa needs technological help in stopping deaths in the country, which he said were not just of white farmers but across the board. “We have too many deaths … It’s not only white farmers, it’s across the board, and we need technological help. We need Starlink at every little police station. We need drones,” he said.South Africa will reportedly offer Musk, who was born in the country, a deal to operate his Starlink satellite internet network in the country. The Tesla and SpaceX boss has accused Pretoria of “openly racist” laws, a reference to post-apartheid Black empowerment policies seen as a hurdle to the licensing of Starlink.South Africa is one of the most unequal societies in the world. White people make up 7% of the country’s population but own at least half of South Africa’s land. They are also better off economically by almost every measure.Away from the cameras, Trump and Ramaphosa held further talks and had a lunch where Musk was present. Later, at a press conference in a Washington hotel, Ramaphosa claimed the visit had been a success for trade and investment – and rejected Trump’s comparison with the apartheid era.“There’s no genocide in South Africa and of course it is an issue of how one looks at it,” he said. “As they say, sometimes the shape of the mountain depends on which point or direction you’re looking at it. In this case we cannot equate what is alleged to be genocide to what we went through in the struggle because people were killed, because of the oppression that was taking place in our country.”But Ramaphosa suggested that Trump remains open to persuasion, telling reporters: “When he was asked by one of you - and thank God one of you asked - whether he was convinced that there was genocide, he said he still isn’t convinced. Much as he flighted the video and all those press clippings, in the end I do believe that there’s doubt and disbelief in his head about all this.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationSouth AfricaDonald TrumpRaceUS immigrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The delegation comprised ambassadors and diplomats representing 31 countries, including Italy, Canada, Egypt, Jordan, the UK, China and Russia.The group was on an official mission organised by the Palestinian Authority to observe the humanitarian situation there. The Israeli military said the visit had been approved but the delegation “deviated from the approved route” and Israeli soldiers fired warning shots to distance them from the area.The Canadian, British, French and other European ministers summoned Israeli ambassadors in their respective capitals to explain the “unacceptable” incident, which will fuel already growing international anger and concern as Israel continues its offensive in Gaza and ramps up the expansion of settlements in the West Bank that are illegal under international law.Germany, a longtime Israel ally, condemned what it called “unprovoked firing,” while Canada, Turkey and the EU demanded an investigation.“We expect an immediate explanation of what happened. It’s totally unacceptable,” Canadian prime minister Mark Carney told a press conference. Four Canadian diplomats were part of the group.A spokesperson for UN secretary general António Guterres also urged Israel to conduct a “thorough investigation”.“It is clear that diplomats who are doing their work should never be shot at, attacked in any way, shape or form, and their safety, their inviolability, must be respected at all times,” said the spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric.Egypt said the incident “violates all diplomatic norms”.The Palestinian foreign ministry accused Israel of having “deliberately targeted” the diplomatic delegation with live fire.The IDF said it regretted “the inconvenience caused” and that senior officials would contact diplomats to inform them of the results of its internal investigation into the incident.View image in fullscreenThe diplomatic delegation visits the Jenin refugee camp and conducts inspections in the West Bank.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyJenin was the focus of a big Israeli assault in January that forced tens of thousands of Palestinians from their homes, one of the largest West Bank displacements in years.A new wave of airstrikes and artillery shelling killed at least 82 people inGazaon Wednesday, including several women and a week-old infant, the Gaza health ministry and hospital officials said.In Khan Younis, where Israel recently ordered new evacuations before an expected major attack into the southern city, 24 people were killed, including 14 from the same family, Palestinian officials reported.Late on Wednesday, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said “all of the Gaza Strip will be under the Israeli army’s control” by the end of its intensified offensive. Amid growing international pressure on Israel to allow food to reach starving Palestinians, he said: “We must avoid a humanitarian crisis in order to preserve our freedom of operational action.”View image in fullscreenSmoke rises from an Israeli airstrike south of Khan Younis, Gaza, on 21 May.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APAbout 100 aid trucks have entered Gaza since Monday when Netanyahu’s government agreed to lift the 11-week blockade that has led to the territory facing a “critical risk of famine”. On Wednesday, several dozen passed through the Kerem Shalom checkpoint but their cargos had yet to be distributed late on Wednesday.Abdel-Nasser al-Ajramy, the head of the bakery owners’ society in Gaza, said at least 25 bakeries that had been told they would receive flour from the World Food Programme had seen nothing and there had been no relief from the hunger for people waiting for food.Much of Gaza’s 2.3 million population rely for survival on free bakeries and community kitchens. Almost all have shut down.1:24Aid trucks trickle into Gaza while airstrikes continue – video report“There is no flour, no food, no water,” said Sabah Warsh Agha, a 67-year-old woman from the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya. “We used to get water from the pump, now the pump has stopped working.

Even the US, the country’s most important ally, has shown signs of losing patience with Netanyahu.On Tuesday, Britain announced the suspension of talks with Israel on a free trade deal, and has, along with France and Canada, threatened “concrete actions” if Israel continues its offensive and restrictions on the free flow of aid.Separately, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the bloc was reviewing its agreement with Israel governing trade ties over its conduct of the war in Gaza. The pact specifies thatall signatoriesmust show “respect for human rights and democratic principles”.The EU’s review could be completed relatively quickly as officials could draw on a 34-page report compiled late last year that details multiple allegations of systemic violations of international law during the conflict by both Israel and Hamas.What will it take to stop Israel’s attacks on Gaza? – podcastRead moreThe report, seen by the Guardian, includes UN statistics on casualty figures and concludes that 44% of those killed in the first months of the Israeli offensive were children. It also lists Israeli strikes on hospitals and stresses that under international humanitarian law, states have the “negative obligation” not to aid or assist in violations of international humanitarian law by parties to a conflict.In Jerusalem, the MP Ayman Odeh, a Palestinian citizen of Israel, was removed from the Knesset podium by security after accusing the government of killing 19,000 children in Gaza and waging war on civilians and the innocent.Earlier this week, Yair Golan, a leftwing opposition leader, drew a furious response from the government and its supporters when he said “a sane country doesn’t kill babies as a hobby” and that Israel risked becoming a “pariah state among the nations”.Golan, a former deputy commander of the Israeli military, is leader of one of the bigger minority parties in Israel’s parliament. His words – and similar comments made by the former prime minister Ehud Olmert in an interview with the BBC – represented a rare focus on Palestinian suffering by leading Israeli political figures. Most domestic criticism of the war has centred on the fate of hostages held in Gaza.Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, dismissed the criticism as “shocking”.“While IDF soldiers are fighting Hamas, there are those who are strengthening the false propaganda against the state of Israel,” Netanyahu, who leads the most rightwing government in Israel’s history, said.Indirect ceasefire talks in the Qatari capital of Doha have faltered. Israel recalled much of its negotiating team on Tuesday, saying it would leave lower-level officials in place instead. Qatari leaders, who are mediating negotiations, said there was a large gap between the two sides that they had been unable to bridge.The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 others. The militants are still holding 58 captives, about a third of whom are believed to be alive, after most of the others were returned in ceasefire agreements or other deals.Israel’s ensuing offensive, which has destroyed large swaths of Gaza, has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.Explore more on these topicsWest BankIsraelPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warGazaMiddle East and north AfricaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It was not about what happens next with the manager; that can wait. It was about grasping an opportunity that does not come around very often, about emerging from what has felt like a generation’s worth of jibes; about winning.On a golden night for their longsuffering followers, they chased the baggage from their backs, they changed the narrative. Yet again, Postecoglou won in his second season at a club. For the first time since 2008, Spurs got their hands on a trophy.Ange Postecoglou keen to continue at Tottenham after Europa League winRead moreThere was an idea that success here could do more than rescue the season and bring Champions League qualification; it could unlock something. Yet in the release of all that pent-up frustration upon the full-time whistle, all that mattered was these 90 minutes – plus those nerve-shredding seven extra ones – inside this stadium.It was a long way from being a classic but try telling that to the hordes in white who danced and pulled each other tight when it was all over, lost in the emotion. Spurs scored just before the interval when Brennan Johnson attacked a Pape Sarr cross, the ball spinning home – just about – with assistance from the unfortunateManchester Uniteddefender, Luke Shaw. And thereafter, Postecoglou’s team simply defended. They did so with their lives. Their expected goals statistic for the second half? 0.00. It did not matter. The only thing that did was keeping United out.Cristian Romero, who started as the captain after Postecoglou named Son Heung-min among the substitutes, was a titan of strength, ably supported by his central defensive partner, Micky van de Ven. But there were heroes everywhere in white. Like Sarr, whose energy was remarkable in the No 10 role. Like Yves Bissouma.United had their openings, none bigger than when Rasmus Højlund looped a header goalwards in the 68th minute and saw Van de Ven take off towards his own line, stretching out one of those long legs to acrobatically hook clear from high above it; one of the defining images.View image in fullscreenTottenham’s Micky van de Ven acrobatically clears a Rasmus Højlund header off the line in the second half.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/ReutersPlenty of the others came after full time. Son’s tears; after 10 years at Spurs, he finally has what he has craved. Postecoglou’s broad smile. He has succeeded where Mauricio Pochettino, José Mourinho, Antonio Conte and all the rest failed. If he departs, after what has been a historically terrible Premier League season, he will do so as a legend.Spurs will arrange the open-top bus parade – it is slated for Friday – and, hey, their fans will probably tell you that they have now won more than Arsenal over the last five years.United fought until the end, Shaw working Guglielmo Vicario deep into stoppage time with a header but yet again, they paid the price for their lack of end product. Winning a trophy would not have papered over the cracks that have yawned wide during a truly awful domestic season but it would have given them a good feeling. They departed with only emptiness.The hype had been extraordinary: redemption or Armageddon. For both clubs. It felt as black and white as that. But if the line about Bilbao bobbins got a laugh, it overlooked how hard the teams had fought to get here; how much it meant.The nerves jangled; hearts hammered. On the pitch and in the stands. There were errors as both teams fought to settle; fouls conceded, clearances fluffed. It was end to end, the tempo lifted from a weekend Premier League fixture. Composure was sorely missing.View image in fullscreenBruno Fernandes struggled to make a decisive impact for Manchester United.Photograph: Vincent West/ReutersPostecoglou has shown that he can be more flexible with his approach in the knockout rounds of this competition. It need not be relentless waves of intricate attacks. Spurs were happy to look long for Dominic Solanke.

It was easy to fixate on Amad Diallo versus Destiny Udogie, with the Spurs left-back intent on taking risks, on driving upfield – and not without success. Diallo was booked for tugging at his shirt during the first half. In the other direction, Diallo shimmered with menace.Spurs blew the game open in the 42nd minute. There had been few clear chances up to that point. Sarr had a shot blocked after a loose Harry Maguire pass for Shaw, Johnson having got in on the initial phase while Diallo flashed in a couple of dangerous balls.Spurs prevail with Mourinho blueprint and ultra pragmatism in baffling final | Jonathan WilsonRead moreThe breakthrough was of a piece with the overall scrappiness. Sarr’s whipped cross from the left was dangerous, with Johnson making a trademark run from the far post. He could not finish on the bounce and that was when fate intervened, the ball rearing up, striking Shaw’s upper arm and squirming, via a brush with Johnson’s boot, into the corner beyond André Onana’s desperate dive.United had been here before this season; trailing Spurs, needing to find an answer. In both of the league fixtures and the Carabao Cup quarter-final, they could not do so, losing all three.Spurs sank deeper, measuring their progress in duels won, clearances executed. Udogie made a crucial tackle on Diallo inside the area before surging forward at the other end, narrowly missing a pass to Solanke. Son got on for Richarlison and Spurs dug even deeper, the Van de Ven clearance standing as a symbol. Vicario had spilled a Bruno Fernandes free-kick and Højlund was able to measure his header.Ruben Amorim made changes, including Alejandro Garnacho and Joshua Zirkzee for Mason Mount and Højlund. United probed. Fernandes blew a header when well placed and Garnacho extended Vicario. Postecoglou sent on Kevin Danso for Johnson and went to a back five. When Vicario denied Shaw, Spurs were there.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueTottenham HotspurManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The locations of the remaining cameras targeted were not provided. The hacking would have provided access to a “snapshot” of the cameras’ images, it is said.Other attempts were made that were designed to gather sensitive information on shipments, such as train schedules and shipping manifests, it is claimed. “In at least one instance, the actors attempted to use voice phishing to gain access to privileged accounts by impersonating IT staff,” says the advisory from 10 countries including the US, France and Germany.It adds: “The subjects of spearphishing emails were diverse and ranged from professional topics to adult themes. Phishing emails were frequently sent via compromised accounts or free webmail accounts. The emails were typically written in the target’s native language and sent to a single targeted recipient.”Paul Chichester, the NCSC’s director of operations, said: “This malicious campaign by Russia’s military intelligence service presents a serious risk to targeted organisations, including those involved in the delivery of assistance to Ukraine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So when there’s an opportunity to make people better off, which is our central purpose, then we’re going to take it,” a government source said.However, No 10 was unable to confirm whether thewinter fuel U-turnwould come into effect by this winter if announced in the autumn budget – or how many of the approximately 10 million pensioners who lost it would have it restored.The reversal comes despite Downing Street ruling out making changes to winter fuel payments afterthe Guardian revealed that it was rethinking the cutamid anxiety at the top of government that the policy could wreak serious electoral damage.Senior Labour figures are hoping the partial U-turn, along with measures to curb child poverty to be announced at the spending review, will help to head off a growing backbench rebellion over the government’s £5bn welfare cuts next month.Ministers are planning to announce a package of up to £750m to tackle child poverty at the spending review in June, the Guardian understands, although the final figure is yet to be agreed.This is expected to focus on measures to tackle the root causes of poverty such as work, housing and education. It could include expanding free breakfast clubs, broadening eligibility for free school meals or raising the amount paid to families in child benefit.Starmer has insisted to his team that the option of tweaking the two-child limit for universal credit, or even scrapping it entirely, should remain on the table. Any decision on this is likely to be taken “down the line”, a government figure said.“The prime minister and chancellor are resolute in their determination to tackle child poverty and the spending review next month will be about making a down payment on that promise,” a No 10 source said.“This isn’t about fiddling around the edges but radical reform and investment in the places that can make a difference to a child’s life chances.”The decision to means test the previously universal winter fuel payment was one of the first announcements by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, after Labour’s landslide election victory last year and has been widely blamed for the party’s collapsing public support.Party activists said the decision to axe £1.5bn in winter fuel payments last July, limiting them to either £200 or £300 a year to pensioners in England and Wales who receive means-tested pensions credit, came up repeatedly on the doorstep during this month’s local elections.“I recognise that people are still feeling the pressure of the cost of living crisis, including pensioners, as the economy improves,” Starmer told MPs at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday.“We want to make sure people feel those improvements as their lives go forward. That is why we want to ensure that as we go forward, more pensioners are eligible for winter fuel payments.”The government has insisted the policy was necessary to help stabilise the public finances, allowing the improvements in the economic picture that Starmer said could result in the partial reversal of the measure.“As the economy improves, we want to take measures that will impact on people’s lives, and therefore we will look at the threshold, but that will have to be part of the fiscal event,” he added.Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “The world’s longest U-turn continues. The prime minister has announced the ‘concepts of a plan’ that have come far too late for the millions of pensioners forced to freeze in their own homes over the winter.“The least those people deserve is an apology for this punitive policy and a serious proposal from the prime minister on how he will begin to pick up the pieces from his government’s disastrous decision. Not vague words that will take months to materialise into something meaningful.”Finding a mechanism to widen eligibility for the payment will cause headaches in Whitehall after the decision to link it to the pension credit threshold. Officials fear that simply increasing the pension credit threshold would increase take-up of that benefit, wiping out any potential savings.Officials said work was starting immediately on how to introduce changes at the autumn budget as they ruled out a full reversal. A more likely option would be creating a new threshold specifically for winter fuel that would allow households not on pension credit to qualify.Raising it 20% above the pension credit threshold would cost about £100m and make about 400,000 more families eligible for winter fuel payments, according to the Resolution Foundation. Or the entitlement could be expanded to those who get disability or housing benefits.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said she would like to see pensioners on £11,000 to £15,000 a year getting winter fuel payments but that it would be “too late” if ministers wait until the autumn budget to set out the details as they would lose this year’s entitlement.Meanwhile, Liz Kendall, the welfare secretary, insisted she will press ahead withmeasures to cut the benefits billdespite pressure from MPs, adding that she would listen to concerns but that the system needs to change.Explore more on these topicsLabourBenefitsKeir StarmerChildrenOlder peopleFuel povertyEnergy billsnewsShareReuse this content"

This is because very dense breasts look whiter on scans, making it harder to detect early-stage disease, which also appears white.Offering this group of women enhanced scans could find 3,500 more cases of cancer and save 700 lives a year in the UK, researchers from the University of Cambridge said. Their findings werepublished in the Lancet.Drug that cuts risk of breast cancer returning is approved for use in EnglandRead moreThe study’s lead author, Prof Fiona Gilbert, said: “Getting a cancer diagnosis early makes a huge difference for patients in terms of their treatment and outlook. We need to change our national screening programme so we can make sure more cancers are diagnosed early, giving many more women a much better chance of survival.”She added: “In addition to the relevance for the UK’s breast cancer screening programme, this study has global implications for all countries where screening is undertaken for women with dense breast tissue.”The study involved 9,361 women in the UK who had dense breasts and had received a negative (no cancer) mammogram result. When additional scanning methods were trialled, an extra 85 cancers were found.Two methods examined were contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM), in which dye is used to make blood vessels more visible, and abbreviated magnetic resonance imaging (Ab-MRI), which is faster than a regular MRI.View image in fullscreenExample mammogram images of healthy breasts showing fatty/least dense (left) and dense (right).Photograph: Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust/PAResearchers said adding either method to existing screening could detect 3,500 more cancers a year in the UK. With screening reducing mortality for about 20% of cancers detected, this could mean an extra 700 lives saved a year, the Cambridge team said.A third scanning method used in the trial – automated breast ultrasound (Abus) – also picked up cancers but was much less effective than CEM and Ab-MRI.CEM detected 19 cancers for every 1,000 women scanned, Ab-MRI found 17 and Abus found four. With mammograms already detecting about eight cases of cancer per 1,000 women with dense breasts, additional scans could more than treble breast cancer detection, the researchers said.The trial was funded byCancerResearch UK (CRUK) with support from the National Institute for Health and Care Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.Although the trial showed the scans could detect additional small cancers, which would probably save lives, further research is needed to confirm whether they could reduce the number of deaths, in order to establish the risk of overdiagnosis and to estimate the cost-benefit ratio of offering extra scans.“More research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness of these techniques, but these results are encouraging,” said Dr David Crosby, the head of prevention and early detection at CRUK.Dr Kotryna Temcinaite, the head of research communications and engagement at Breast Cancer Now, said: “The UK National Screening Committee now needs to consider this research as part of their current review to determine whether women with very dense breasts should be offered additional imaging during their routine screening.”She added: “Routine breast screening is the most likely route to finding breast cancer early, when treatment is most likely to be successful. While we know that the current process can be less effective in detecting cancers in dense breasts, we still encourage all women to attend mammogram screening when invited.”The Department forHealthand Social Care said research into enhanced scans for women with dense breasts was being carried out as part of the NHS breast screening programme. “The UK National Screening Committee is reviewing this evidence as it becomes available,” a spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsBreast cancerHealthWomen's healthNHSCancer researchCancerMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

An investigation was carried out, which led to the Crown Prosecution Service authorising the above charge.”Earlier this month, the Met said Kneecap was being investigated by counter-terrorism police after videos emerged allegedly showing the band calling for the deaths of MPs and shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”.The counter terrorism internet referral unit (CTIRU) is a national unit based within the Met’s counter-terrorism command, which is dedicated to identifying terrorist and extremist material online.Both Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.A Metropolitan police spokesperson said at the time: “We were made aware of a video on 22 April, believed to be from an event in November 2024, and it has been referred to the counter-terrorism internet referral unit for assessment and to determine whether any further police investigation may be required.“We have also been made aware of another video believed to be from an event in November 2023.”Kneecap said they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and apologised last month to the families of murdered MPs but claimed footage of the incident had been taken out of context and was being “exploited and weaponised”.A number of concerts featuring the band have been called off since the videos emerged.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is often regarded as one of New Labour’s most successful social policies.The programme was dismantled by Conservative-led governments elected from 2010 onwards. At its peak in 2009-10 Sure Start had 3,600 centres in England, before austerity cuts reduced government funding by two-thirds, with local authoritiesscaling back or closing most of the centresby 2018.The IFS looked at children born in the 1990s and 2000s who took part, and found it improved health and educational outcomes, including better than expected GCSE results, as well as reducing school absences and less severe special educational needs and disabilities.Nick Ridpath, a research economist at the IFS and an author of the report, said: “These benefits are not only important in their own right, they also generate savings to the public purse and boost lifetime earnings. Sure Start did not quite pay for itself from the government’s perspective. But taking benefits for lifetime earnings into account, in the long run it will generate around twice as much value as it cost.”At its peak, Sure Start’s running costs were about £2.7bn a year in 2023–24 prices. The IFS calculated that the government benefited from savings of £600m each year in lower health, special needs and social care demands, and £1.9bn in extra income tax and national insurance revenue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Clearly, then, investing in quality integrated early years services is not just the right moral decision, but a smart economic choice too.”The researchers warned that Sure Start was not a “silver bullet”, with the programme “unable to address all challenges that children and young people face”. It noted that it had no significant effect on the number of children spending time in council care and didn’t reduce support for more serious special needs provision.Explore more on these topicsEarly years educationInstitute for Fiscal StudiesChildren's healthSpecial educational needsChildrenEnglandThinktanksnewsShareReuse this content"

It marks a turning point.” Even if Lammy’s rhetoric and his actions did not match, sometimes language matters in diplomacy. The use of words such as “extremist” and “abhorrent” to describe the actions of a longstanding ally ricocheted across the global media landscape.The explanation for Lammy’s suspension of free trade talks at one level is self-evident. The accumulation of picturesof emaciated children, the threats to “purify” Gaza by some Israeli ministers and the apparent inability of the Americans to persuade Israel to accept that a permanent ceasefire was a legitimate price for the release of the Israeli hostages became too much.View image in fullscreenPeople in Gaza face starvation as Israel blocks aid into the territory.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPABut frustration had been mounting ever since Gideon Sa’ar, the Israeli foreign minister, met Lammy on what was intended to be an unpublicised visit on 16 April. The main subject of the meeting, described as private by the Foreign Office, focused entirely on matters of state and specifically the Israeliblockade on humanitarian aidin Gaza that had started on 2 March, more than six weeks before.Lammy had condemned the blockade from the start and at one point on 17 March in the Commons described it as a breach of humanitarian law, a judgment he had to retract since government policy is that only international courts and not the UK government make judgments on breaches of international law. Regardless of the precise legal status of Israel’s blockade, Lammy described it as “unacceptable, hugely alarming and very worrying”.What will it take to stop Israel’s attacks on Gaza? – podcastRead moreBut the meeting with Sa’ar did not go well. Asked by the Telegraph to characterise its tone, Sa’ar said: “You always gain something by making your arguments and intentions clearer.” He insisted the denial of aid was not a form of collective punishment or unlawful.At the same time, UK concern had been mounting about shadowy plans forthe Gaza Humanitarian Foundationthat was due to start aid operations at the end of May. The GHF was to be overseen by Jake Wood, a US military veteran who ran Team Rubicon, an organisation that distributed humanitarian aid during natural disasters.In essence, the organisation would replace the now-banned UN human rights agency, Unrwa, as well as Ocha (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs), the UN’s main humanitarian body.Since November, Ocha has been led by Tom Fletcher, a former chief foreign policy adviser to Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron. All three of them came to rely upon him, but he later retreated to academia to be principal of Hertford College, Oxford. Lammy lured him back into public service, persuading him to apply for the job of chief of Ocha – for historical reasons a job that has largely been a British sinecure.View image in fullscreenA private meeting between Lammy and Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, was said to be fraught.Photograph: Nicolas Garriga/APFletcher’s first few months in the job from November had been attempting to limit the impact of US aid cuts, but he soon realised that Israel’s blockade of aid and plans for the GHF were part of an attempt to remove all trace of the UN fromGaza.He formally sounded the alarm in a speech on 13 May to the UN security council, most remembered for his call for decisive action to “prevent a genocide” and a warning to members to ask themselves how they would account to future generations when asked if they truly did all they could to stop Israel’s “unashamed inhumanity”. In a chamber numbed by empty rhetoric about neglected horror, he managed to elevate the question to a matter of personal responsibility.But he also spelled out the implications of the GHF for Palestinians and the humanitarian community, including the plan to kettle Palestinians in one part of Gaza, seen as a prelude to either voluntary or involuntary deportation.He said the GHF plan “restricts aid to only one part of Gaza while leaving other dire needs unmet. It makes aid conditional on political and military aims. It makes starvation a bargaining chip. It is a cynical sideshow. A deliberate distraction. A fig leaf for further violence and displacement.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US issued an amber light for the UK to go harder on Israel to end the blockade.At the same time, the UK had already been alerted by the Dutch foreign minister, Caspar Veldkamp, on a visit to London on 6 May that the EU would be reviewing its trade relationship with Israel, reflecting a change in mood inside his own government, and potentially Europe.At the start of the week, the diplomacy bore fruit. A British-engineered ring-round led on Monday to a joint statement by 27 donors, mainly western countries, endorsing Fletcher’s concern about the GHF.“Humanitarian aid should never be politicised, and Palestinian territory must not be reduced nor subjected to any demographic change,” the 27 said. Despite the limited restart of aid announced by Benjamin Netanyahu, the donors still warned: “Palestinians faced starvation”.Hours later, the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron,also intervenedagain using unprecedented language.“If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response,” a joint statement read. Significantly, the statement made reference to a UN-sponsored conference in June, chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, on a two-state solution.The UK, France and Canada are all members of the G7 group of western countries, due to meet at a G7 leaders’ summit on 15-17 June, the day before Saudi Arabia and France chair a three-day UN summit in New York to advance a two-state solution.Macron has already said that the New York summit may be the moment for a consortium of countries to recognise Palestine as a state. It is possible there could be an interplay between the two summits.The French have launched such recognition initiatives in the past,only to pull back, and inside the Foreign Office there is a belief that recognition, a symbolic card that can be played only once, has to be played at a point of maximum impact.But the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said this week: “We are determined to recognise the state of Palestine”. Self-evidently, the more Israel occupies Gaza and extends settlements on the West Bank, the less likely there will be any Palestinian state left to recognise.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyIsraelGazaUnited NationsDavid LammyMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now we have learned thatDonald Trumpis an honorary Boer.When he turned his attention toSouth Africaon Wednesday, it may come as no surprise that the US president – who has been sued for discriminating against Black apartment seekers, called for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, pushed the false claim that Barack Obama was born in Kenya, referred to Haiti and African nations as “shithole countries”, and blamed an air crash on DEI – was rooting for the whites.Trump hadlaid a trap for South African president Cyril Ramaphosain his gold and gaudy Oval Office. After 20 minutes of relative pleasantries, Trump’s delusion that a white genocide is happening in South Africa inevitably reared its ugly head.Ramaphosa said “listening to the stories” of South Africans would help his counterpart better understand. But then, with his audience captive, Trump turned sinister and ordered his staff to dim the lights and activate a big screen. He was like a Bond villain startling guests with noxious gas or a doomsday machine.Trump’s ‘white genocide’ claims ignore the reality of life and crime in South AfricaRead moreNatalie Harp, a White House aide known as the “human printer” because she prints out favourable newspaper cuttings for Trump’s attention, swung into action. She plugged a laptop in the TV and played a video that showed South African opposition politicians Jacob Zuma and Julius Malema singing apartheid-era songs about shooting Boers, a term that refers to farmers or Afrikaners.Then came drone footage purportedly showing Afrikaner graves marked by white crosses. Then Trump brandished a sheaf of newspaper cuttings about recent killings in South Africa, muttering bleakly: “Death, death, death, horrible death.” Between the two men loomed a bust of Winston Churchill, who covered the Boer war as a reporter and was held as a prisoner in Pretoria.Poor Ramaphosa had to sit and take it as the terrible truth dawned: he had been Zelenskyy’d. The last time Trump pulledan ambush like this, his weapon was the vice-president, JD Vance, bullying and berating the leader of Ukraine.This time, Vance was content to remain silent, wearing an absurdly long red tie and glowering with menace like an attack dog straining at the leash. Joining him on the sofa were defence secretary Pete Hegseth, looking gormless, and commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, looking smug. Behind them stood South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, brimming variously with boredom and contempt.But Ramaphosa had learned lessons from Trump’s attempt to turn diplomacy into a reality TV series. France’s Emmanuel Macron, Britain’s Keir Starmer and Canada’s Mark Carney have all run the gauntlet of the TV cameras in the Oval Office, expertly serving up a sycophancy sandwich that combines craven flattery with a bit of gristle in the middle – a willingness to stick up for their own country.Moreover, Ramaphosa knows Trump’s type and was not going to be intimated by white supremacy. He was born to a police sergeant and a domestic worker and grew up under the violent regime of racial apartheid. He was arrested after leading a student protest at college and served 11 months in solitary confinement. He founded a national mineworkers’ union and became an acolyte of Nelson Mandela in the liberation struggle.He flattered Trump by calling South Africa’s economy “tiny” compared with the US’s – but who is the bigger man?It must have been hard for Ramaphosa to take when Trump, droning on about the persecution of white farmers, asserted: “Now I will say, apartheid: terrible. That was the biggest threat. That was reported all the time. This is sort of the opposite of apartheid.”But Ramaphosa had prepared a soft ambush of his own.Starmer might have brought an invitation to meet the king, but Ramaphosa knew that Trump loves nothing more than golf, so he brought the gift of a big book about South African golf courses. More importantly, he had a white cavalry including agriculture minister John Steenhuisen andgolfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen.There was also South African’s richest person, luxury goods magnate Johann Rupert, both whitesplaining and wealthsplaining – the two languages that Trump understands.“We have many deaths, but it’s across the board – not just white farmers,” Rupert said, saying the country needs technological help from Musk’s Starlink, and even recalling how much his wife loved JD Vance’s book Hillbilly Elegy.Trump had failed to hector Ramaphosa into submission and, like a bully lashing out, took out his frustration on NBC reporter Peter Alexander, whom he branded a “jerk” for asking abouthis plan to accepta $400m plane from Qatar.“Why did a country give an airplane to the United States air force?” Trump asked rhetorically. “So they could help us out, because we need an Air Force One. That’s what that idiot talks about, after viewing a thing where thousands of people are dead.”Ramaphosa interjected: “I’m sorry I don’t have a plane to give you.”Trump, with a model plane on the table before him, responded: “I wish you did. I would take it. If your country offered the United States air force a plane, I would take it.”“OK,” Ramaphosa replied, trying to keep a straight face.Like Macron, Starmer and Carney before him, he had survived Washington’s trial by television.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe US politics sketchCyril RamaphosaSouth AfricaAfricaUS foreign policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The show that shakes you senselessFrom vibrating stages and a car park dance floor to metal pipes tuned to the frequency of ‘love’, the artists behind a new exhibition say their work may even change your body on a cellular levelLyndsey WinshipWed 21 May 2025 10.14 EDTLast modified on Wed 21 May 2025 10.15 EDTShare‘You know, 528Hz is supposed to be the love frequency,” says artist Evan Ifekoya, striking a metal wah-wah pipe tuned to exactly that pitch, a fraction above the C, one octave higher than middle C. “It’s supposed to be able to transform the body on a cellular level. And, OK, how can you really prove that?” they smile. “But I can say, at least for myself, it has opened up a new level of awareness and self-compassion over the years.”We know music is powerful: we turn to songs to feel comforted, to boost our energy, to appreciate beauty and so much more. But what about the frequencies; the actual soundwaves vibrating the air, our eardrums and our bodies – how do they affect us? From promoting deep relaxation to the use of noise as a weapon, there is a wide range of claims, and evidence, for the impact of sound. It moves us emotionally and literally, a theme that’s explored in a new exhibition at the Barbican in London called Feel the Sound. “The idea that the world is made up of vibrations and frequencies is something we don’t necessarily think about a lot of the time,” says Luke Kemp, head of creative programming at Barbican Immersive. “The big idea is how sound is more than an audio experience. We can think of our whole body as a listening device,” he says.View image in fullscreenAn installation at Feel the Sound.Photograph: © Thomas Adank/Barbican CentreTake Jan St Werner’s Vibraceptional Plate installation, which visitors can stand on and then explore the resonance of their own body, and a film by deaf percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie discussing the rhythms inside us and how she experiences sound. There’s a holographic choral experience, a playground of multisensory musical instruments, and for the finale, an installation in the Barbican’s car park featuring souped-up cars with big sound systems; part sculpture, part dancefloor.Ifekoya’s piece, called Resonant Frequencies, is an immersive soundscape using frequencies believed to be healing. Visitors will be able to sit or lie on a vibrating stage to hear and feel the sound, as well as see its effect on a pool of water at the centre of the room. As we chat, Ifekoya tells me about other supposedly powerful frequencies, such as 174Hz (roughly the F below middle C). “This one reportedly works with the internal system, the organs, to regenerate and repair.” They show me a frequency board (a special type of circuit board) emitting an inaudible 7.83Hz, one of the frequencies produced by electromagnetic waves in the Earth’s lower ionosphere. “This is the frequency my home is grounded at,” says Ifekoya. Has it had a positive effect? “My plants are thriving,” they laugh.Anyone who has found themselves next to the bass bins in a club will know the physical power of sound is real. “You feel the low frequencies hitting and vibrating your body,” says electronic musician (with a PhD in computational biology) Max Cooper, who has plenty of experience seeing the visible effect of his music on crowds of clubbers when he plays around the world. In the piece Cooper has made for Feel the Sound, called Reflections of Being, visitors can get some of that subwoofer experience, “the full body massage” as he puts it, without fear of hurting their ears, via tactile benches in the installation space which make no sound but shake instead. “I’m a big fan of tactile sound,” Cooper says, pointing to a tactile transducer–or bass shaker–fixed to the back of his studio chair, which allows him to feel low-frequency vibrations. “I do a lot of low frequency harmonies and when you play on a big sound system in a big venue, you feel that transfer directly into your body.”Cooper started the project by asking the public how they were feeling – the question was: “What do you want to express that you feel you can’t in every day life” – and then created music in response. The replies he got were “beautiful, scary, intense, funny,” he says, and had a powerful effect on him. He felt a responsibility to do justice to the people who’d trusted him with their honesty. “Because, you know, it’s fine to talk about tactile benches, but ultimately it’s the emotion that we can communicate that’s important.”View image in fullscreen‘We can think of our whole body as a listening device’ … Jan St Werner’s Vibraceptional Plate, 2024.Photograph: Sanja Bistričić SrićaThat intersection of science with sensation and emotions is exactly where multidisciplinary designer Robyn Landau works, translating academic insight from neuroscience into creative projects, often aimed at improving wellbeing. For the installation Your Inner Symphony, her company Kinda Studios has collaborated with designer Alex Jenkins from Nexus Studios to make the invisible inner workings of our bodies tangible. Visitors will go to a “sensing station” and put their hand on a sensor to measure heart rate, heart rate variability and galvanic skin response (ie how much you’re sweating). Then, once they’ve moved through the exhibition, they’ll be able to test themselves again to see what’s changed and their readings will be translated into images and sound.It’s based on the idea that “emotions live as physiological sensations inside of our bodies”, says Landau. “And these physiological changes are what shape our feelings.” It’s very well documented, she says, that sound frequencies interact with our brainwaves, but researchers are now learning how frequencies interact with the way the body maps emotional responses. One study showed that we sense different emotions in specific parts of our bodies, and there is lots of research on entrainment – the way humans naturally sync up with rhythms in music, such as when our heart rates match a musical beat, or when we automatically tap our feet to one.View image in fullscreenPart sculpture, part dancefloor … souped-up cars in the Barbican’s car park.Photograph: © Thomas Adank/Barbican CentreThe science on specific frequencies such as 528Hz is less established, Landau says. “There is some evidence,” she says tentatively. “Not all of it is clinically proven. But just because it’s not proven doesn’t always mean it’s not true. Sometimes we don’t have the tools to be able to measure it properly.” Most current research in that field is focused on largely inaudible, low frequency sound. “This is where we feel stimulated from inside,” says Landau. “There’s lots ofresearch to showthat these low frequency vibrations can effectively make people more tolerant to pain.” She likens it to a cat’s purr when it’s relaxed. (Cats also sometimes purr when they’re stressed to self-soothe – humans might try humming for the same effect.)There is a lot more to learn, but it’s clear that our brains and bodies are constantly responding to the soundworld around us, whether we’re aware of it or not. Sound “drives a cascade of bodily sensations that shape the visceral feeling of being emotionally moved”, says Landau. “I hope that people can come away from the exhibition with a sense of awe about their own body,” she adds, “and how magical a place it really is.”Feel the Sound is at theBarbican, London, from 22 May to 31 AugustExplore more on these topicsInstallationElectronic musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And when fate parts them in the years after, their love story becomes something more poignant.They are farm-boy Lionel from Kentucky, played byPaul Mescal– a sonorous, stately voiceover at the very beginning reveals him to have perfect pitch and synaesthesia, the ability to comprehend music in taste and colour as well as sound – but these abilities are not actually revealed in the film.The other man is David, played by Josh O’Connor, a man from a more privileged background, without Lionel’s instinctive music talent and destined for a college instructor’s job.View image in fullscreenImpeccable … Josh O'Connor in The History of Sound.Photograph: Gwen Capistran/Fair Winter LLCMescal and O’Connor are of course very talented actors and they never do anything other than an impeccable professional job but they have each shown more passion in, variously, Andrew Haigh’sAll of Us Strangersand Francis Lee’sGod’s Own Country.This is a film about music as well as love, but the folk songs, for which Mescal and O’Connor gamely fabricate enthusiasm, sound like museum pieces kept under glass and the love story itself feels as if it is kept under glass. The accents and line-readings feel like painstaking expert reconstructions rather than the real thing and the love scenes are at half-throttle – as if they are there to be remembered sadly rather than experienced ecstatically in the here and now.There are, I concede, well-judged moments of tenderness and loneliness in the long aftermath to the long goodbye – in Lionel’s lonely wanderings in Italy and England, and in the revelation involved in his meeting with the woman that David married after their idyllic Maine summer. And there is to be a kind of final meeting between the two, involving that wax cylinder technology, perhaps inspired by a famous ending by Graham Greene.Everything here is out of the top drawer of production value: but it never really comes to passionate life.The History of Sound premiered atCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalPaul MescalJosh O'ConnorFestivalsDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet as well as communicating what we’re thinking and feeling, they can also reveal clues about our age, lifestyle and health – presented as some of the most common eye concerns, including puffiness, dark circles, fine lines and wrinkles.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The good news is that today’s eye cream and serum formulations can go a long way to address those issues when used as part of a daily skincare routine. Many products do more than simply hydrate the area around the eyes; next-generation formulas work harder and smarter, combining science-backed ingredients with skincare tech.However, is it really necessary to invest in a dedicated eye cream, I hear you ask? In short: yes. Face serums can be too potent and moisturisers too heavy for use around the delicate eye area, and doing so could see you make your eye concerns worse.At a glanceBest eye cream overall:Medik8 Crystal Retinal Ceramide Eye£42 at Cult BeautyBest budget eye cream:The Inkey List Caffeine eye cream£7.95 at SephoraBest eye serum for puffiness:Charlotte Tilbury Cryo-Recovery eye serum£47 at SephoraBest eye cream for dark circles:Tatcha The Brightening eye cream£64 at Space NKBest eye cream for fine lines:SkinCeuticals AGE Advanced Eye£105 at Look FantasticWhy you should trust meI’m an experienced beauty journalist, and am regularly sent products to test. I’ve been evaluating and writing about skincare for 16 years – so, as you can imagine, I’ve tested a lot of eye creams and serums.Perhaps what qualifies me most to give a verdict on eye creams and serums is that I’m afflicted with the issues the formulas below are designed to address. With undereye bags and dark circles revealing themselves when I haven’t had enough sleep and fine lines that began to appear as I hit my 40s, I’m the perfect candidate to put these products through their paces.What dermatologists look for in an eye creamSkincare experts agree on one thing: if you’re looking for an effective eye cream or serum, pick one that is made up of hard-working, science-backed ingredients that target your particular concerns. Retinoids, for example, are key players for fine lines, wrinkles or discoloration and are best known for theiranti-ageing benefits. Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives and are generally prescription-strength. Retinol and retinal are milder types of retinoid and tend to be available as off-the-shelf products.“Retinoids prompt surface skin cells to turn over quickly, making way for fresh skin underneath,” says Dr Elizabeth Hawkes,oculoplastic surgeon and aesthetic doctor. “It helps to slow the breakdown of collagen and thickens the deeper layer of skin to help prevent wrinkles.”If dark circles are a problem, then you need to start by identifying their cause. “Dark circles may be caused by the appearance of blood vessels under the thin skin,” says Dr Miriam Adebibe,cosmetic and regenerative doctor. “Working on collagen production and skin thickness can reduce them.”Shadows beneath the eyes can also be the result of an accumulation of melanin, which causes pigmentation. In this case, Adebibe and Hawkes agree that reaching for a formula with skin-brightening powerhouse vitamin C would be the best bet. It’s a powerful antioxidant, which when paired with SPF can even protect the area from ageing in the first place.Puffiness is another common concern, and I’ve had great success with caffeine eye creams to reduce my undereye bags. By constricting blood vessels and decreasing inflammation, caffeine creates a temporary tightening effect, making the skin beneath the eyes look fresher.We shouldn’t forget hydration, which is crucial for overall skin health. Consultant dermatologistDr Alia Ahmedname-drops hyaluronic acid, glycerin and niacinamide as some of her favourite ingredients for maintaining moisture in this delicate area.How I testedTo make the process as simple as possible, I turned to the formulas I have emptied, replaced or bought on repeat. When you test products for a living, it’s a big deal for a beauty editor to finish and/or stick to a product. I tested (or re-tested) 25 eye creams, each for a minimum of two months, for this article. I used them daily in my morning and evening skincare routines, apart from the eye creams containing retinol (or retinoids): they are suitable only for PM use because the active can cause sensitivity and irritation when exposed to sunlight.Here are the 10 products that performed best in my tests.The best eye creams and serums in 2025Best eye cream overall:Medik8 Crystal Retinal Ceramide EyeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine Wiesel£42 at Cult BeautyFrom £42 at Medik8Medik8 has a simple philosophy for a results-driven skincare routine: “CSA”, which stands for vitamin C and sunscreen by day, and vitamin A by night. Accordingly, the brand offers some of the best retinoid formulations on the market, including this advanced retinal eye cream.Why we love itForget retinol, it’s all about retinal (with an “a”) these days – and this cream has plenty of it. An advanced retinoid, retinal is known to work 11 times faster than standard retinol, according to Medik8, while being more gentle on the skin. As such, you’re less likely to experience some of the side effects associated with using retinoids, such as redness or peeling. I can testify that I haven’t had any irritation while using this eye cream.Medik8’s formula is available in three strengths (three, six and 10), but if you’re new to this class of product, I advise starting with the three because low and slow wins the race with retinoids. Over time, it will work to speed up the skin’s natural renewal process and boost collagen and elastin production. You’ll see it plump crow’s feet, erase discoloration and firm the eye area.It’s a shame that …on a personal note, I didn’t start using this from an earlier age.Size:15mlUse:PMVegan:yesRecyclable packaging: yesActive ingredients: retinal (retinaldehyde), ceramides and hyaluronic acidBest budget eye cream:The Inkey List Caffeine eye creamView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine Wiesel£7.95 at Sephora£8 at BootsI’ve gone through two or three tubes of the Inkey List’s effective and affordable Caffeine eye cream. My puffy eyes struggle to wake up without its star ingredient.Why we love itThis lightweight, non-greasy formula is easy to apply and feels refreshingly cool on the skin – even more so if you store it in the fridge as I do. It’s fast absorbing, too; I give it only a minute or so to sink in before applying my concealer.You can almost feel it getting to work as you apply it, the caffeine stimulating blood flow and temporarily tightening skin. Other hard-working ingredients include hyaluronic acid to draw hydration to the area, squalane to keep it locked in, and a powerhouse peptide called Matrixyl 3000 that plumps fine lines with time. All in all, this effective cocktail of ingredients delivers plenty of bang for your buck.I’ve seen improvement after just a single use, with that improvement continuing when used more regularly as part of my day and night-time skincare routine.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t come with an eye-cooling applicator like the one included with Charlotte Tilbury’s eye serum, but that might be an ask too far for its often-sub-£10 price.Size:15mlUse:AM and PMVegan:noRecyclable packaging:yesActive ingredients:caffeine, peptide Matrixyl 3000 and squalaneBest eye serum for puffiness:Charlotte Tilbury Cryo-Recovery eye serumView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine Wiesel£47 at John Lewis£47 at Charlotte TilburyMakeup artist Charlotte Tilbury’s eponymous beauty brand is as much-loved for its skincare as its makeup, helping to propel the status of the brand. In my opinion, this eye serum, which was inspired by the cold therapy that she uses on models backstage at shows, is one of her best.Why we love itAs well as the benefits of caffeine, this serum comes loaded with cryotherapy-inspired ingredients that work wonders to de-puff skin by constricting blood vessels and reducing inflammation. The formula’s effects are further enhanced by the cooling metal tip applicator with which you apply the product; it glides over the eye contour smoothly, without dragging the skin.It felt soothing and cool and appeared to instantly reduce the puffiness of the skin around my eye. So much so that I’ve taken to using the massaging applicator throughout the day too, especially after a long evening or a perimenopausal night of tossing and turning.It’s a shame that …if the skin around your eyes is particularly dry like mine, then you’ll likely need to use a more hydrating product overnight.Size:15mlUse:AM and PMVegan:yesRecyclable packaging:noActive ingredients:caffeine, peptides and hyaluronic acidSunscreen and snail slime: what skincare experts do – and don’t do – to their skinRead moreBest eye cream for dark circles:Tatcha the Brightening eye creamView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine Wiesel£64 at Tatcha£64 at Space NKInfused with brightening powerhouse vitamin C, I’m awarding this Tatcha launch the best eye cream for dark circles because it helps on two fronts. As well as guarding against the daily aggressors that cause ageing, neutralising free radicals and protecting the skin against the sun, it also repairs damage already present, brightening the skin and boosting collagen production for firmer, plumper skin.Why we love itIt perked up my tired-looking eyes instantly and over time. The instant gratification is thanks to the inclusion of light-reflecting pigments that create the illusion of brighter eyes. However, the real magic happens because of the hefty dose of vitamin C, which releases slowly over time without irritating the delicate area.Evidence shows that vitamin C may helpbrighten skin, and using this cream twice a day saw the area around my eyes looking more refreshed and radiant after just a week. With continued use, skin felt firmer and fine lines looked reduced after about a month.It’s a shame that …you have to be realistic with your expectations; while such products can improve the condition of skin, they can’t completely eradicate dark circles.Use:AM and PMSize:15mlVegan: noRecyclable packaging: noActive ingredients:vitamin C, niacinamide and antioxidantsBest eye cream for fine lines:SkinCeuticals AGE Advanced EyeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine Wiesel£105 at Look Fantastic£105 at SkinCeuticalsThe reason top dermatologists often line their glass cabinets with this luxe beauty brand is that it gives professional-grade results. More recently, this corrective eye cream has reaffirmed that there’s far more to SkinCeuticals’ lineup than just its viralC E Ferulic vitamin C serum(although there’s no denying it’s worth its hype).Why we love itAs soon as I applied this silky cream to the skin, optical diffusers flooded my undereye area in light to bring instant radiance and make my dark circles appear less noticeable. It reduces puffiness, too, thanks to its dose of caffeine.However, what elevates this eye cream is its ability to smooth the look of fine lines and address firmness when used longer term. It achieves this by targeting advanced glycation end products (or AGEs, hence the product’s name) with SkinCeuticals’ patented active proxylane. AGEs build up in our skin as we get older, or as a result of poor diet and lifestyle, degrading collagen and elastin.It’s a shame that …it has such a hefty price, though its multitasking benefits are worth the splurge – so think of it as an investment.Size:15mlUse:AM and PMVegan:noRecyclable packaging:yesActive ingredients:proxylane (a patented active), peptides and caffeineskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

With its rich and creamy texture, I’m only here to add to its rave reviews; it’s one of the most hydrating eye creams I’ve ever tested.The not-so-secret star ingredient is, of course, avocado oil. Along with shea butter, it nourishes and softens the eye area to provide all-day hydration, while beta-carotene provides antioxidant protection. It’s had a little upgrade, and now includes caffeine, which will work to reduce puffiness. The results? The skin around my eyes is instantly smoother and less tired-looking.It didn’t make the final cut because …it may be too rich for some, especially if you’re prone to milia (small white cysts).Use:AM and PM;size:14ml;vegan:no;recyclable packaging:yes;active ingredients:caffeine, antioxidants and avocado oilMurad Retinal ReSculpt eye treatmentView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine Wiesel£92 at Murad£92 at SephoraBest for:mature skinReSculpt eye cream is formulated to target more advanced signs of ageing (think deep lines, wrinkles and sagging eyelids) and uses retinal to improve the condition of skin more quickly, without irritation.It shows: after just a week’s use, my undereye area felt revitalised and much smoother. Best results are noticeable after about a month, when lines start to look less visible and the brow bone looks lifted for a more youthful, well-rested eye area.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s more than double the price of Medik8’s retinal eye cream.

Often termed “botox in a bottle”, I was sceptical about its performance. However, just seconds after applying, it started to smooth, firm and lift the eye area; after minutes, it had reduced the look of lines and puffiness. I was impressed!The effect is down to Firm-A-Tite, a blend of skin tighteners that you can feel working their magic. I found that achieving the best results took trial and error; use it sparingly to avoid any residue, and remain expressionless while it dries (this is the hard bit). You also must wait until it’s fully dry before applying makeup.It didn’t make the final cut because …its results are temporary, which in my eyes makes it feel more like makeup than skincare.Use:when needed;size:30ml;vegan:no;recyclable packaging:yes;active ingredients:Firm-A-Tite and peptidesCeraVe Skin Renewing eye creamView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine Wiesel£23 at Boots£16.99 at AmazonBest for:valuePromising to pack more of an anti-ageing punch than its popular counterpart (CeraVe’s Eye Repair Cream), I couldn’t wait to get my hands on this new product from the purse-friendly skincare brand. With an ingredient list including hyaluronic acid and niacinamide for hydration, caffeine for de-puffing, ceramides for skin-barrier strengthening and skin-plumping peptides, it didn’t disappoint.The silky, balmy texture of this cream proved instantly refreshing on application, de-puffing and smoothing my tired morning eyes, ready for makeup, for which it makes a great base. It tackles fine lines over time when used twice a day, but for more dramatic results, you’d be better opting for a formula containing retinoids.It didn’t make the final cut because …personally, I didn’t see enough rejuvenation of the eye area with continued use.Use:AM and PM;size:15ml;vegan:no;recyclable packaging:yes;active ingredients:hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, ceramides and peptidesBioderma Atoderm Intensive EyeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sabine Wiesel£14.60 at Notino£17 at Look FantasticBest for:EczemaEyelid eczema (or eyelid dermatitis) is commonly caused by allergens and irritants – not only those you might apply to your skin, but even your nail polish or jewellery could be to blame. If you’re suffering, as I have recently, then go back to basics with this soothing, skin-repairing formula that also removes makeup well.This ceramide-rich cream instantly calmed irritation and soothed discomfort, and after a few days of use, I saw redness reduce, and crepey, scaly skin return to its former smooth feel.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not comparable with the other eye creams and is only for very dry and stressed-out skin.Use:AM and PM;size:100ml;vegan: no;recyclable packaging:yes;active ingredients:hyaluronic acid, glycerin and ceramidesWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenEasy does it: a pea-sized amount of cream should be enough for both eyes.Photograph: Karin Dreyer/Getty Images/Tetra images RFHow to apply eye creamThe most important thing to remember when applying product to the eye area is to be gentle. The best way to achieve this is using your ring finger; it’s the weakest digit, so it prevents you from applying too much pressure. In terms of how much eye cream to use, think less is more. A pea-sized blob should be enough to cover both eyes.Apply by patting the cream or serum into skin, working from the inner to the outer corners of your eyes and along the orbital bone, or eye socket. If you’re looking extra puffy, “Start with 10-20 press pats on your lymph nodes in front of your ears (you will be able to feel the slight dip after the bone and before the cartilage) and apply your cream downwards,” saysclinical facialist Kate Kerr.Do you put eye cream on before or after moisturiser?The general rule is to apply your skincare from the thinnest to the thickest in consistency. This is to avoid the larger molecules of thicker formulas blocking the smaller ones of lighter products and preventing them from being absorbed into the skin. I always apply my eye cream before my richer moisturiser for this reason.Is it better to use eye cream in the morning or evening?“During the day, it’s about prevention and protection. This is where your antioxidant-rich serums and sunscreens come in, helping to fight pollution and damaging oxidisation, as well as protecting the skin from the damaging effects of light,” says Kerr. “Come night-time, it’s about correction and stimulation. Use targeted serums focusing on your individual skincare needs, such as plumping or reducing dark circles.”Sabine Wiesel is a freelance beauty editor.

If you didn’t know their story, you might think they were runners or cyclists. Then you see the tattoos’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 21 May 2025 09.36 EDTLast modified on Wed 21 May 2025 12.45 EDTShareMy first trip photographing Americans was in 2015, when I drove 8,000 miles across the country on aHarley-Davidson. I’d spent too long caught up in assignments and wanted to take some time off from commercial and editorial work to follow my own creative urges. America offered an opportunity to explore a landscape I didn’t know, and was far enough away from my home in the Netherlands to ensure it wouldn’t be easy for me to just go back if things got difficult.I think Europeans often don’t understand how tough life in America can be. I wanted to show real, underrepresented people who are just trying to survive, while also drawing attention to how rich their lives can be. At a time when people seem increasingly polarised in their views, my images seek to challenge the assumptions that often divide people, and to focus on the common experiences that connect us.This picture is from a more recent series,American, which I undertook with my husband between 2022 and 2024. Again, I took portraits of people we encountered while driving from state to state and we also recorded interviews and documented their stories on film. I spotted Derek and Quentin from our car as we were driving through Elkhart, Indiana. They were wearing hoodies and their faces were hidden. I don’t know what it is that attracts me to people, it’s just this gut feeling – I see certain people and feel I need to talk to and observe them.So I jumped out of the car and ran towards them. I said something like: “Hey, are you brothers?” They said: “Yeah, yeah.” But they were not really looking at me. I told them I was a photographer and film-maker from Amsterdam, and when they heard the word “Amsterdam” they were suddenly interested. I discovered they were 29-year-old twins who lived nearby in a tent, in woodland behind a friend’s trailer home.They’re unconsciously mirroring one another in the way they’re holding their handsThese boys had never learned how to have a “normal” life – how to organise everything, show up to a job, all the basic things. Their mom has a severe mental health condition and never stays in the same place for long and their dad died of an overdose a couple of years ago. Their grandma had taken care of them until they left and started living on the streets. But they have each other, and if you asked them, they would say they had a good childhood. This was where they felt at ease and wanted to live.If you didn’t know their story, you could look at this picture and think they are maybe runners or cyclists. Their skin is white where it’s been covered by T-shirts but their necks and forearms are tanned, and the colour of their skin and hair is echoed by the orange flowers in the background. Then you see the tattoos – Quentin, on the left, has a little star under his eye. They’re also unconsciously mirroring one another in the way they’re holding their hands. There’s so much going on in this picture that it’s a little confusing. But because of that, you keep staring, and that, for me, is a way to break something open – people who see this photograph are curious and always want to know more about these boys.I use a medium format camera because I love capturing the texture of people’s skin and hair, and the twins were fascinated by that and the other tech we were using – the film camera and sound equipment. They’re really into machines and electronics. You can see in their gaze that they’re communicating with me, their posture is open. That’s how I like to approach these portraits – they’re a collaborative process. I love being in that moment where the subject is as completely focused on me as I’m focused on them and we’re reacting to one another.Even when my work exhausts me, it’s not something I can just park, or detach myself from. I always say that through my photography, I’ve created my own family. Just likeRandy, who I formed a close bond with on that first trip across America and still speak to daily, I’ve stayed in regular contact with Derek and Quentin. They are very dear to me.View image in fullscreenRobin de Puy’s CVBorn:1986, Oostflakkee, the NetherlandsTrained:The Photo Academy, Rotterdam.Influences:“Mary Ellen Mark, Egon Schiele, David Lynch, Richard Avedon, Larry Clark and Harmony Korine (I love Kids and Gummo).

According to a 2024reportfrom the business consulting firm McKinsey & Company, global beauty-market sales reached $446bn in 2023. By 2028, sales are expected to reach $590bn.With all the noisy marketing, how do we know what skin actually needs?“It’s very understandable that today, many patients are overwhelmed and have no idea what skincare products are best for them,” says Dr Elizabeth Bahar Houshmand, a double board-certifieddermatologist. While everyone’s dermatological needs are different, Houshmand says, overdoing it on products can do more harm than good and, often, “less is more”.Here’s what you need to know about starting a skincare routine.What does the skin do?Despite all the emphasis on its appearance, skin is not merely decorative.Skin is the body’s largest and most adaptable organ, says Dr Charlie Dunn, a double board-certified dermatologist. Its three primary layers are the epidermis, which is the waterproof barrier at the top; the dermis, a “collection of collagen, scaffolding, hair roots, glands and nerves”; and a layer of subcutaneous fat below it, which serves as a shock absorber, energy reserve and form of insulation. Most topical skincare products work at the level of the epidermis.The skin “essentially serves as our first line of defense against the outside world”, says Dr Lindsey Zubritsky, a board-certified dermatologist. It keeps “the good stuff in and the bad stuff out”, she says, meaning that it helps the body retain moisture and stay hydrated, and acts as a shield against so-called “environmental aggressors” like UV radiation and air pollution.Additionally, the skin helps regulate the body’s temperature using mechanisms like sweat and blood-flow regulation, explains Houshmand. It also contains sensory receptors that detect touch, temperature and pain, and when it is exposed to sunlight, it triggers the production of vitamin D, which isessentialfor the immune system, nervous system and musculoskeletal system.What does healthy skin look like?Hailey Bieber oncesaidshe wanted her skin to look “like a glazed donut”. There have also beendewy dumplingandJello skintrends.But skin doesn’t need to look like confectionery to be healthy.“Healthy skin is functional skin,” says Dunn. This means that skin feels comfortable (no itching, burning or tightness), looks calm (no redness), holds moisture, heals quickly and stays balanced (no sudden flare-ups as a result of, for instance, mild soap or weather changes).Healthy skin also has an even texture and tone, is uniform in pigmentation, is well-hydrated and has minimal sun damage, says Houshmand.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’When skin is unhealthy, it can appear dry, red or inflamed; be full of acne breakouts; or be broken on its surface in some way, says Zubritsky. Unhealthy skin can be caused by internal factors like genetics, disease or poor nutrition, she explains, or by external factors like pollution, allergens and temperature changes.Skin can also tell you about someone’s overall health and lifestyle, says Houshmand. Lots of time outdoors without adequate sun protection, for example, can lead to wrinkles, spots, uneven pigmentation and a loss of skin elasticity. A lack of sleep can result in dark circles under the eyes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Choosing a gentle cleanser is important, because this allows you to clean the skin without harming it.After cleansing, use a moisturizer. This is a must no matter the skin type, Zubritsky says: “This will help heal, protect and keep the skin barrier intact.”Finally, always apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen – SPF 30 or higher – no matter the weather.None of these products needs to be expensive. “The best routines are simple, affordable and built on a solid foundation,” says Dunn.More from How to start:How to start meditatingHow to start weightliftingHow to start budgetingHow to start runningIf you want to do more, Zubritsky suggests adding a retinoid at night to reduce signs of aging, and a vitamin C serum in the morning to brighten and protect the skin. But these aren’t essential. And if you do choose to expand your skincare routine, only add one product at a time so you can see how your skin adapts to it.If your skin doesn’t immediately respond to a new routine, don’t despair.Skincareproducts take time to work properly, says Houshmand, and too often, people stop using them before they’ve had a chance to kick in.Houshmand says she tells her patients it takes a minimum of four to six weeks to see any changes, and three to six months to see the optimal results of a product or regimen.“Nothing works in a day or a week,” she says.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHow to startSkincareBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Evie was born at 5.34am on Monday.That’s a bit specific. Any idea where?Daddy and Mummy Pig welcomed Evie into the world at the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s hospital in London, where the Duchess of Cambridge, now the Princess of Wales, had her children.This is the cartoon Peppa Pig, right? And not some weird family who have changed their nameby deed poll?That’s right. A town crier made the announcement outside the hospital.I didn’t realise the Pigs lived in London.Don’t be silly, they live in Peppatown.And why Evie?She was named after an aunt of Mummy Pig’s, after a period of agonising indecision. “We’ve got SO many ideas for names. Too many, frankly!” Mummy Pig told Grazia last month.Sorry, did you say Grazia?Yes, don’t you follow celebrity news, or are you too high-minded for that sort of thing?It’s just that I had no idea Mummy Pig was even pregnant.That was first announced in February, although it wasn’t revealed on the show until 30 March, Mother’s Day in the UK.How is Peppa taking the news?Peppa and her brother, George, are said to be “thrilled”, but we’ll see how long that lasts.Remind me how old Peppa is again?Peppa is four, but the show has been on the air for 21 years, so you could say 21, or possibly 25.I don’t know how to react to that.Just rejoice in the happy news like everyone else.Everyone else?Congratulations have been rolling in from nursery brands, Boots and others since the announcement was made live on Good Morning Britain.People are certainly making a big deal out of this.That’s hardly surprising, given that Peppa Pig is broadcast in more than 180 territories worldwide, in more than 40 languages. The official YouTube channel has almost 40 million subscribers. A new character presents, if nothing else, a huge marketing opportunity.Who owns Peppa Pig?In 2019, the company that owned the franchise was acquired byHasbro for £3.3bn.That’s a lot of money.Peppa makes a lot of money. In addition to programmes, books and merchandise, there are theme parks all over the world, including Peppa Pig World in Hampshire.Ah, yes. Boris Johnson’s favourite place, according to aconfused and rambling speechhe made to theConfederation of British Industry in 2021.I’ll bet he hasn’t been back.Do say:“Welcome, little Evie.”Don’t say:“I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house down!”Explore more on these topicsPeppa PigPass notesChildren's TVMarketing & PRfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In Trump 2.0, the word stands for conservative femininityDebate over ‘chic’ has erupted online as luxury-minded TikTokers push a definition that aligns with the Maga setAlaina DemopoulosWed 21 May 2025 13.42 EDTLast modified on Wed 21 May 2025 14.31 EDTShareThe idea of “chic” is a fashion-world cliche. At best it is a know-it-when-you-see-it vibe, at worst a lazy adjective chosen by a writer to describe something that reminds her of Jane Birkin. It feels inoffensive enough. But now, “chic” has become something of a lightning rod online – a shorthand for a type of conservative-coded aesthetic.It began last month, when a creator named Tara Langdale posted avideoto her TikTok following of just over 30,000 in which she sipped from a long-stemmed wine glass and read off a list of things she finds “incredibly UN-chic”. Wearing stacks of gold bracelets and a ballet-pink manicure, Langdale called out fashion choices like tattoos, Lululemon, visible panty lines, baggy denim andhunting camouflageas unchic, because, to her, these choices seemed “cheap”.“Remember, money talks, wealth whispers,” Langdale said.The not-entirely-serious video racked up views and sparked a conversation about how style preferences can carry political baggage. “This is giving mean girl,” one user wrote in the comments. “Classism isn’t chic, hope this helps,” wrote another. “Voting for Trump is unchic,” went a third. Many took particular issue with Langdale’s anti-tattoo stance, which they saw as stuffy or downright rude.View image in fullscreenTara Langdale thinks tattoos, baggy denim with stretch and Louis Vuitton carryall bags are unchic.Photograph: TikTok user @tara_langdaleSuch comments came with a strong dose of projection: Langdale, a lifestyle influencer, does not post about politics, sticking to fashion, makeup or motherhood. Nevertheless, many in the fashionTikTokcommunity felt her commentary on “chic” aligned with the feminine aesthetic of Trump 2.0, where the rigidand airbrushed beauty standards of Maga officials such as Karoline Leavitt, Kristi Noem and Nancy Mace are celebrated.“Chic is starting to feel like a conservative dogwhistle that polices women’s looks,” said Elysia Berman, a creative director and content creator based in New York whoposteda takedown of Langdale’s unchic list. “What chic has come to mean to a lot of people is a very narrow definition of elegance. It’s this thin, white, blonde woman who speaks softly and is basically Grace Kelly.”The ideal vision of womanhood from Donald Trump’s first term was caked foundation and clumpy mascara, as seen on the likes of Kimberly Guilfoyle and Lara Trump. But the facial augmentation and overly sexy aesthetic tied to the president’s inner circle – see “Ice Barbie” Noem, who posts full glam videos while deporting immigrants – does not necessarily match that of the president’s more social media savvy supporters, many of whom are now opting for a sleeker presentation.MomfluencersandtradwivescelebrateRFK Jr’s “Make America Healthy Again” policies while wearing breezy milkmaid dresses.Evie Magazine, a politically conservative version of Cosmo, appropriates the trending visuals of feminist magazines with headlines that decry body positivity and promote vaccine skepticism. As the New York Magazine writer Brock Colyardescribedyoung Republicans at a post-election night party: “Many are hot enough to be extras in the upcoming American Psycho remake.”The word “chic” has always been tied to a French, or francophile, sense of femininity, usually in reference to a woman who subscribes to Vogue and innately understands how to look good. But those turning it into a dirty word on TikTok, taking note of how it aligns with a changing conservative aesthetic, see it as having a more prescriptive, even oppressive, meaning for women’s fashion.Suzanne Lambert, a DC-based comedian whose “conservative girl” mock makeup tutorials went viral earlier this year, described the right’s obsession with all things ultra-feminine as “just this soulless, boring kind of fashion”.“Republicans are more focused on assimilating than we are on the left, so it makes sense that they all end up looking the same,” Lambert said.Chicness is more reflective of your resourcefulness and creativity, rather than any sort of socioeconomic elementKat BrownUltimately, anyone who’s attempting to look chic – or wealthy – is probably neither of those things. Those TikTok imitators who equate chicness with pearls and a Leavitt-esque tweed shift dress? “They think it’s giving Reagan, but it’s really giving Shein,” said Lambert.(Ironically, some of the unchic pieces on Langdale’s list – Lululemon leggings, Golden Goose sneakers, a Louis Vuitton carryall bag – come with hefty price tags and could connote liberal elitism.)In an email, Langdale said that her definition of chic had nothing to do with politics. “Chic by definition means simplicity and timelessness,” she wrote. “Reading a neutral palette as ‘conservative’ conflates style choice with ideology. Conservatism as a moral or political stance varies widely across cultures and religious communities, so tagging a fitting tank top and trousers as ‘Republican’ is lazy stereotyping.”Langdale called chic “this year’s version” of “old money” dressing, a TikTok trend that prioritized subdued, luxury items over the loud, brash and individualistic. “You can own every item on my unchic list and still be considered chic,” she wrote. “Labeling an item chic or unchic speaks only to its aesthetic, not a person’s style or worth.Now comes the ‘womanosphere’: the anti-feminist media telling women to be thin, fertile and RepublicanRead moreThe conversation around chic is ongoing.Other creators, inspired by Langdale’s video, posted about what they considered chic in their niches. A medical studentsaidit was “incredibly chic” to color coordinate scrubs with personal accessories; an office workerconsiderednot letting colleagues in on their personal lives the height of chicness.Kat Brown, a 25-year-old New Yorker who works in fashion PR, made avideotalking about how it’s “not chic” to be overly trendy, with chicness coming from a more sustainable wardrobe. “Smart consumption is chic,” Brown said. “Chicness is more reflective of your resourcefulness and creativity, rather than any sort of socioeconomic element.”For all the angst on chic-Tok, true insiders probably aren’t paying much attention. Fashion editors often make lists of words they consider so dull and unspecific that they prohibit writers from using them in copy; “chic” is usually right at the top. And when a word like chic is so bland to begin with, who cares if its wielded as an insult?

To understand why, visit BirminghamSharon GrahamMinisters are targeting low-paid bin workers while cosseting billionaires. Supporters could not be more disillusionedSharon Graham is the general secretary of UniteWed 21 May 2025 10.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 21 May 2025 12.13 EDTShareSix months ago, it was a stirring, a mood felt in many workers’ meetings, on picket lines and doorsteps. What started as disappointment in Labour is now giving way to anger for many British workers and their communities. “Aren’t Labour supposed to be for workers?” is a line I hear daily now. Most recently, this sentiment has been felt in Birmingham, where bin workers for the Labour-run city council have been onindefinite strikesince 11 March.These workers woke up one morning to be told they would lose up to a quarter of their pay – what Unite believes to be up to £8,000. This is “fire-and-rehire” by any other name. Bin lorry drivers are now being told they are next in line to lose the same amount in pay. What makes this scandal all the more egregious is that it is being perpetrated by a Labour council – enthusiastically backed by a Labour government. Onebin worker saidthis government “might be Labour in name, but it isn’t Labour in nature”.That specific is mirrored in much more general conceptions. Labour voters can’t believe that this government would, with almost its first act,cut the winter fuel allowancefor pensioners, regardless of theU-turn it has now made. Then it attacked those on welfare benefits. Why would a Labour administration target some of the country’s most vulnerable people instead of making the rich pay more, through a real wealth tax? Unite research shows that the assets of the richest 50 families in the UK areworth £500bn. That’s more than the wealth of a third of Britain. A 1% tax on the richest 1% would raise £25bn. Labour in name but not in nature is right.And nothing is more symbolic of Labour’s disconnection from its core mission than the catastrophe of the Birmingham bin strike. Angela Rayner, Labour MPs, and the leader of Birmingham city council, John Cotton, who incidentally has not attendedone single negotiationon the bin strike, have spent weeks, if not months, demanding that our members should simply accept “the fair and reasonable offer on the table”. The problem is there isn’t one.I’ve seen this charade play out week after week since the strike began: Unite decision-makers are in the room with a group of council employees who clearly do not have the power to make any decisions. Hence, there have been no real negotiations and certainly no settlement of the dispute.When Acas conciliation was suggested, I said I would be there in person and that I expected the leader of the council to do the same. After all, he had said in public just days before that “nobody needs to lose any pay” – surely we should have been in touching distance of a deal? But Cotton, once again, did not turn up to the talks, sending Joanne Roney, the managing director of the city council instead, who introduced herself as a decision-maker. I asked for a copy of the “fair and reasonable offer”, but yet again, none was produced.Both Rayner and Cotton have cited lump sums in the thousands being put on the table, together with moves that would result in no loss of pay. None of this was seen at Acas. Nonetheless, the talks began, and a “ballpark” deal was discussed, one that could finally be taken back to workers to ballot. That was on the 6 May. Roney said she would send a written draft by 8 May, but at the time of writing, we have yet to receive the offer. A simple written offer dictating terms.Dysfunction worthy of the House of Windsor: the real reasons rubbish is piling up in Birmingham | Kate KnowlesRead moreSo why the delay? The government’s own commissioners – who have beenin placesince just after the council effectively declared itself bankrupt in 2023 – are now apparently blocking the deal, despite Rayner previously claiming central government has “no part in the decision-making of the dispute”. Roney is reportedly being prevented from putting in writing what we discussed at conciliation unless they agree to it. Of course, this is what Unite has been saying all along: Birmingham city council’s decision-makers are simply not in the room.In 35 years of negotiating huge disputes, I have never seen such a shambles. Our members can see through Labour’s spin. How can a Labour council be doing this to their own workers? What happened to the “change” promised by Starmer?Make no mistake, these workers have the full backing of Unite. Losing up to a quarter of their pay means many won’t be able to pay mortgages or rent, or cover other basic living costs. This cannot be allowed to happen.How can a Labour council and a Labour government preside over these pay cuts and say with a straight face that they are the party of workers? The recent local election results are a warning to Labour that the anger is becoming more widespread. The party needs to change course; driving “further and faster” while you are heading for a cliff doesn’t usually end well.Sharon Graham is the general secretary of UniteExplore more on these topicsBirminghamOpinionIndustrial actionPublic services policyLocal governmentcommentShareReuse this content"

Most would wax lyrical about their school days and the teachers who taught and inspired them.Yet the government of which those women make up almost half the total number of MPs is now targeting spending on “education and gender” for cuts in the overseas aid budget. It is beyond depressing.Jenny Chapman, the international development minister, could not have been clearer when giving evidence to a select committee last week. The decision to reduce aid spending from 0.5% to 0.3% of national income by 2027 meant something had to give, and that was money that had hitherto been spent not just on building schools in poor countries but also encouraging girls to attend them. In a more challenging spending environment, the UK will now make health its priority.Make no mistake, Chapman faces some unenviable choices. There is no soft landing when you have to implement a 40% cut in your budget. But a slash-and-burn approach to education is indefensible and would have been anathema to previous Labour governments.Things were certainly different 20 years ago, when the final preparations for a G8 summit at Gleneagles involved the prime minister, Tony Blair, and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, successfully lobbying fellow world leaders for a$50bn aid packageand a comprehensive debt relief deal.Times are tougher now. At the time of Gleneagles, the global economy was booming and government finances were healthy. The global financial crisis was still two years away, and only the most inveterate pessimists foresaw the age of austerity that would follow the near collapse of the banks.In 2005, the rich countries of the west were minded to be generous. Today they are not, and it is naive to imagine that the aid budget is going to remain sacrosanct when the British government is planningcuts to disability benefits.All that said, cutting aid spending on education for girls is still a bad policy choice. Before it was axed as a standalone ministry by the Conservatives and subsumed into the Foreign Office, the Department for International Development commissioned countless studies into whether spending money on encouraging girls to go to school should be a priority for the aid budget. It concluded that it should be – and for good reasons.Women with an education are far more likely to go to a clinic and have their children vaccinated. They are also more likely to get antenatal care and seek early treatment for diarrhoea and pneumonia, both potential killers.The evidence is compelling: if all women completed primary education and gained basic literacy, maternal deathswould be reducedby two-thirds.In Malawi, each additional year of maternal education cut infant mortality by 10%. In Uganda, each extra year of schooling cut the risk of infant mortality by more than 16%. Chapman seems not to get the point that cutting education spending will reduce the effectiveness of spending on health.In 1996, the year before he became prime minister, Blair said the three priorities for a Labour government would be “education, education, education”, and the reason he said that was because investment in education is good for growth and boosts living standards. That applies even more to poor countries than it does to rich countries. In a low-income nation, every year of schooling results in a10% increasein earnings.Nor is investing in education costly. One study has found that $100 (£75) pays for the equivalent oftwo extra yearsof teaching for girls. With the government keen to ensure that every penny of a reduced aid budget is used effectively, that represents excellent value for money.Ministers of all parties once accepted all these arguments as a matter of course. This, for example, wasAlok Sharma, Boris Johnson’s international development secretary, back in 2019: “Educating girls prevents child marriage and early pregnancy, helps women into the workforce and boosts household incomes and economic growth. Supporting education for girls and women gives them a greater voice. That voice helps them to shape their own future and advocate for changes in their own lives and, very importantly, the lives of other girls and women.”All of which remains as true now as it was then. Education is worthwhile not just because of the quantifiable economic benefits – important though they are – but because of the spin-offs it generates. The economist Amartya Senhas pointed outthese intangible gains – confidence, ability to engage in political processes, capacity for absorbing and processing information – that create opportunities. In countries where gender equity is deeply entrenched in homes and labour markets, education is a gamechanger.If, as Chapman says, a reduced aid budget is the “new normal”, there are ways of mitigating the pain. The government could alter the balance so that more British spending goes through multilateral organisations, such as the World Bank, which have the financial firepower to make pooled resources go further.It could press harder for a comprehensive debt relief agreement that would allow poor countries to devote more of their spending to education. But that has to start with a different approach. This is not just about the money; it is also about a mindset that appears to have forgotten that encouraging girls to go to school is good for health, good for growth, good for poverty reduction, good for gender equality and good for the self-esteem of women.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsAidOpinionChildrenWomenLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s unlikely we will ever see that happen againWed 21 May 2025 11.55 EDTLast modified on Wed 21 May 2025 13.13 EDTShareAmid the controversy around Gary Lineker’s exit from the BBC, a couple of points need making, entirely unrelated to the circumstances of his departure. First, how vanishingly unlikely it is we’ll ever again see an elite footballer become an elite presenter. Second, that when he started out on the road to being a consummate broadcaster, he was absolutely hopeless.I say this as someone whose broadcasting career covers roughly the same period. Someone who played a distant second fiddle to Lineker’s first violin at BBC Sport, before becoming his rival and opposite number when I took on the role of lead sports presenter at ITV. In that contest, there turned out to be only one winner. And it wasn’t me. I must admit, I did occasionally give in to annoyance and bitterness along the way, but whatever. I know when I’m beaten. There’s no shame in being beaten by the best. And I wasn’t alone: naming ITV football presenters seen off by Lineker is a bit like remembering failed US presidential candidates. I’ll be Mitt Romney.View image in fullscreen‘Not naturally gifted’ … Gary Lineker in the 1986 World Cup squad.Photograph: Colorsport/ShutterstockWhen I heard Lineker’s first attempts at presenting, on radio, I had just started out in the same business, albeit off the back of a mediocre showing in my university studies rather than a career as an international footballing legend and national treasure. As I listened to Lineker’s first faltering steps on air, I honestly felt rather angry with management for putting him in that position, and real pity for the chap I’d admired so much as a player making a bit of a fool of himself. He just wasn’t a broadcaster. And most people who start out sounding that bad don’t get any better. But Lineker, not for the first or last time, was the exception proving the rule.At BBC Sport a lot of time and energy was expended helping Lineker learn the ropes. Countless not-for-broadcast football shows were organised for him to get the hang of it, and get the hang of it he did. You could see this as the BBC putting more effort into nurturing him than they would anyone else. Which is true. But it’s also true that in Lineker they had someone prepared to put the work in. I can’t imagine any other elite footballer, then or now, who’d put so much effort into learning the craft. And it is a craft. If you think it’s just sitting there talking, you’ve never tried doing it, for real, in front of millions.I’ll never play golf like Rory McIlroy. But maybe he can teach me how to live with my mistakes | Adrian ChilesRead moreIn football punditry there’s a cliche often used when a player does something clever. They are said to have done something which is “a great example to any young players watching at home”. Well, Lineker is one such example. Not so much for his brilliance as a footballer and broadcaster, but for the intelligence and sheer graft he put in to get himself to that level.This seems to be the case with most things he does. Back in 2006, over breakfast in our hotel in Berlin during the World Cup, he told me about how he’d not considered himself naturally gifted as a player. He said he’d “worked out” how to be a great striker by watching the great Mexican player, Hugo Sánchez. He looked at videos of Sanchez over and again, figuring out where to run, when to run, how to score. And when Lineker took up golf he was, according to him anyway, not a natural. So he had “millions of lessons”, which, with almost weary inevitability, saw him become really good at that, too.It’s a big challenge for broadcasters to find former players of any standing to join their sports teams as decent pundits. Let’s face it, most male ex-footballers certainly don’t need the money. Finding a legend of the men’s game with the ambition and skill to be the frontman, the next Gary Lineker, is likely to prove impossible.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Isn’t£300mat the expensive end for these events? And should it really take four-and-a-half weeks, and counting, for one of the UK’s biggest and well-resourced retailers to restore its website to working order?The response of Marks & Spencer’s chief executive, Stuart Machin, to such questions ran along these lines: the incident had nothing to do with underinvestment in IT; everyone is vulnerable; M&S was unlucky; the “moment in time” will pass and everything will be back to normal by July at the latest.View image in fullscreenStuart Machin, the CEO of M&S, should be on safe ground with his ‘bump in the road’ financial thesis.Photograph: M&SToo complacent? Marking his own homework? Well, before joining the chorus that says M&S should have been better prepared, one should probably say that assessing corporate responses to these cyber-attacks is impossible from the outside. M&S can’t share the full details of what happened, just as nobody ever does. One suspects its reaction was better than most, but there isn’t a league table to consult. We will have to wait to see what, if any, fine is dished out by the Information Commissioner’s Office forbreaches of customers’ data.But Machin is probably on safe ground with his “bump in the road” financial thesis. If the top-line hit of £300m can be whittled down to £150m-ish after the arm-wrestle with the insurers plus management of costs “and other trading actions”, one is looking at a number that, while large, is a long way from upsetting M&S’s broader revival.This is a group that has just reporteda 22% jump in underlying pre-tax profits to £876m, its best result in 17 years, and the balance sheet these days is a model of conservatism, showing year-end net cash of £438m ignoring lease liabilities. As long as the IT/cyber issues are contained and fixable, M&S can handle the financial blow. The website, which is where the crisis was concentrated (and still is), accounts for only a tenth of sales. Ensuring it comes back reliably, as opposed to prioritising absolute speed, sounds sensible.Scattered Spider is focus of NCA inquiry into cyber-attacks against UK retailersRead moreIt is hard to know how customers will react, of course. Machin probably shouldn’t place too much weight on the fact that many are telling him they’re terribly supportive; the ones to worry about are the non-communicative sort. “We are nervous that customers will have their long-term habits changed,” says Jonathan Pritchard at the broker Peel Hunt. It’s a legitimate concern but, equally, it’s entirely possible that customers take a sanguine view and carry on as before. Most of us, let’s be honest, aren’t making amateur IT appraisals when we shop.The show of corporate confidence – plus the forecast-beating pre-attack profit numbers – were enough to repair some of the damage to the share price. It rose by 2.5% on Wednesday, meaning it’s down a net 8% since the Easter cyber villainy. That reaction feels roughly right. This was a severe incident, it’s embarrassing and it’s not yet over. But if £150m is the ultimate one-off net cost to M&S – and, crucially, if there is no repetition – the roof has not fallen in.Explore more on these topicsMarks & SpencerNils Pratley on financeRetail industryCybercrimeInternetOnline shoppingConsumer affairsHackingcommentShareReuse this content"

These are all contributing factors, but there’s another, more hidden cause that isn’t talked about enough: abuse, especially during childhood. I recall Chad Varah, the founder of Samaritans, reflecting that there were many things that drove people to call the charity’s suicide helpline. But abuse was a prominent reason.Abuse isn’t an easy subject to raise or talk about. It brings up issues of gender dynamics – a colleague studying global sexual abuse told me: “The vast majority of perpetrators are men; the victims are equally boys and girls.” These are hard issues to think about, harder still to discuss and difficult to address. They challenge notions of safety, trust, family and community. But if we want to make progress in addressing poor mental health, we have to start here – with the truths we’d rather avoid.The internet has fundamentally changed our world. Where once we worried about a child walking home from school alone or sleeping over at a friend’s house, now we have the entire online world to contend with. Grooming and exploitation no longer happen only in person – they happen on smartphones, in video games and through tablets handed over to keep kids entertained. And too often, the adults meant to protect children are far behind.Recent research fromChildlight, a child safety charity at the University of Edinburgh, has shown a steep rise in online grooming cases. It estimates that about 830,000 young people worldwide are at risk of social exploitation and abuse every day. This includes explicit photo sharing, sexual extortion, solicitation, deepfake images, pornography and grooming. Social media platforms, messaging apps and multiplayer games have become common avenues for abusers to target youngsters. They’ve been designed to be attractive and addictive to children, but largely without their safety in mind. And that puts the burden of protection unfairly on parents, many of whom don’t understand the risks – or aren’t even aware that they exist.Take Roblox, a platform marketed as a child-friendly virtual playground. Behind its colourful, blocky graphics and simple games lies a reality far less innocent.A recent studyexamining interactions within the game found that through its open chat features, users were able to initiate contact with children as young as five, and were able to potentially speak with them over time before moving to other, less public platforms. Children could also see and hear sexual and suggestive content while playing various games. The researchers found that a test avatar registered to an adult could ask for a five-year-old’s test avatar’s Snapchat details on the platform. Just last month, aCalifornia manwas accused of kidnapping and sexual conduct with a 10-year-old he met on Roblox. The surface looks benign. The danger lies underneath.One thing that should be noted, too, is that even if physical contact never occurs, exposure to traumatic or sexually inappropriate content can still leavelasting mental scars. The internet and social media in particular have made it easier to access this kind of content, even if a child is never contacted by a coercive individual. Online abuse can take many forms, from exposure to sexual images and videos to inappropriate sexual and non-sexual language, extortion and solicitation.In 2023, an estimated 19% of children aged 10 to 15 in England and Wales exchanged messages with someone online whom they had never met in real life.Nearly a third of eight- to 17-year-olds who game online saythey chat to strangerswhile gaming.The vast majority of those interactions will be harmless, but when bad things do happen, many children feel isolated or unsupported: only half of children in a survey in Englandtoldtheir parents or teacher about harmful content they had seen online.The same shame, confusion, fear and guilt that silences victims of abuse in the real world also mutes those suffering from exposure virtually.That silence can be deadly.Studies have shownthat children who are groomed or coerced online often suffer from anxiety, depression, PTSD and suicidal thoughts. According to Samaritans, children and young people with histories of abuse are at far higher risk of self-harm and suicide. Varah’s reflections underscore this: abuse, especially when unaddressed, can derail an entire life. But awareness is the first step towards prevention. We need to remove the stigma around abuse so that survivors of any age can speak up.Timid new online safety laws won’t prevent more tragedies like the death of my daughter Molly | Ian RussellRead moreWe also need to better understand how quickly the landscape of risk is evolving. This means having open conversations with children, not just once but regularly. It means teaching them that they can talk to us about anything they see or experience online, without fear or shame.Tech companies need to be regulated by government to be accountable for creating safer environments. Just leaving it to voluntary initiatives doesn’t seem to be enough.On 25 July, the Online Safety Act will beimplemented in Britain, with clear safety rules for platforms to protect young people from harmful content, online abuse and sexual material. It is an important step forward in treating this issue with the urgency it deserves – just as we would with any other public health threat.While Samaritans continues its vital work supporting those in crisis, we owe it to our children to intervene earlier, to prevent that crisis from occurring in the first place. If we want to protect the mental health of young people, we need to start where the damage begins – and that means looking directly at the hard truths, online and off.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s a little tricky to execute, but hear me out, OK? Step one: find a time machine. Step two: travel back to 2020. Step three: quickly, before they all get nabbed, buy the entire stock of theThis Smells Like My Vaginacandle that Gwyneth Paltrow notoriously sold on Goop for $75 a pop. Then come back to 2025 and sell them on eBay for $400 each. Seriously, that’s what they are going for now. We’re talking a 433% return!How do I know this? Not, to be clear, because I am spending my evenings searching for vagina-scented candles. No, I know this because the chatter around Paltrow’s candle is impossible to fully extinguish; it keeps popping back up in the news. In 2021, for example, there was a big hoo-hah because a Texas man claimed that the candle exploded on his bedside table. No one was injured but alawsuit was filedfor the Texas man and others who “through no fault of their own, bought defective and dangerous vagina-scented candles”.That case was later dropped.The candles are now back in the headlines because Paltrow was speaking at an event called the Mindvalley Manifesting Summit over the weekend and revealed that her famous creation originallystarted off as a joke. The perfume team were apparently messing around with scents when she said, “Oh, that smells like … you know.” And, well, you know what happens next. Paltrow also revealed that she thinks her candle was very “punk rock” and challenged the shame around female sexuality. And if you don’t agree, she thinks you should “go fuck yourself”.Anyway, back to the details of my get-rich-quick plan. A time machine might seem preposterous but, according to the Mindvalley Manifesting Summit’s website,manifesting means“bending time and reality through intention, intuition and aligned action”. So manifest the damn thing and start getting that vagina candle money!Perhaps you’re wondering if it wouldn’t be easier to just manifest a bunch of cash instead? Yes, come to think of it, probably. Although, honestly, you shouldn’t take financial advice from me. I started my working life as a corporate lawyer, then went into advertising, and now I am a freelance writer. Instead of climbing the career ladder chasing pay rises I slithered down it chasing pay cuts. Still, here I am living the dream and writing about vaginas for a living.

A clearer sign was his apparentsympathywith Vladimir Putin. Mr Trump’s tone regarding the Russian president hascooled somewhaton the discovery that the conflict cannot be frozen by White House diktat. There are hints of recognition that the peace process is failing because the Kremlin is cynically playing for time. Sadly, any such insight hasn’t evolved into outrage at the criminal aggression that started the war in the first place.Accounts of atelephone callbetween the two leaders earlier this week indicate no increase in American pressure on Russia. Mr Trump’s impatience with the whole issue seems likelier to result in him walking away. Mr Putin relishes that prospect.Ukraine’s European allies have tried to coax Mr Trump into a more pro-Kyiv stance, while making contingency plans for US disengagement. But even on optimistic projections of increased defence spending, Europe is a long way from achieving capacity to provide for its own security. For now, American help is indispensable.Ukraine’s military has beaten the odds and defied gloomy prognoses before, checked Russian advances and inflicted bruising defeats on their aggressor. But Mr Putin has a grim advantage in numbers. He calculates that time is on his side, that he can keep feeding conscripts into what Russians call the “meat grinder” and, by means of bloody attrition, force Volodymyr Zelenskyy to submit.Russia’s military resources are finite. And, while Mr Putin has repressed domestic dissent, he cannot indefinitely brush aside the deaths of many tens of thousands of young men. State propaganda celebrations of a war that has achieved none of its declared aims ring hollow.Mr Putin’s greatest weakness is a brittle economy, geared to perpetual war, that is failing to meet the needs of civilians whose living standards have been degraded by inflation. Russia’s budget is dependent on oil revenues, and the price of crude has fallen recently (partly in response to Mr Trump’s trade-suffocating tariffs). Western sanctions already impose a price cap on Russian oil exports and the EU has proposed lowering it further.Brussels and the UK this week coordinated a further round ofsanctions, including efforts to close the “shadow fleet” loophole that sustains Kremlin oil revenues. Ukraine is urging its European friends to go further still, with secondary sanctions targeting countries that buy from Russia or provide it with technological assistance.Across the Atlantic, a majority of US senators support the application of firmer economic pressure on Moscow, but Mr Trump prefers emollience and even normalisation of commercial relations.The US president’s Kremlin-friendly bias has been a consistent obstacle to the defence of Ukraine, but not an entirely immovable one. He doesn’t want to look weak – an aversion that can be mobilised to dissuade him from total appeasement of Mr Putin.The Russian president might also have less time than he thinks. He projects an image of himself as a master strategist, but the evidence of a hubristically launched and badly run war doesn’t support that analysis. The Kremlin can lie about the grim state of theRussian economy, but can’t hide it for ever. That is a vulnerability which Ukraine’s allies must continue to target with maximum force.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In alecturethis spring, Prof Putnam, now 84, warned his audience that, amid levels of polarisation and distrust higher than at any time since the civil war, the US was “in danger of going to hell in a handcart”.Britain is still, thankfully, a long way from the poisonous toxicity of Trump-era America, notwithstanding the ominous rise of Reform and Nigel Farage. Butresearchpublished this week by the More in Common polling group paints a worrying portrait of communities in which there is a widespread sense of social disconnection, high levels of distrust among the young and a felt loss of shared spaces and rituals.Alarmed by the progress of Reform in “red wall” seats that it won back in the last election, Labour haschosenprimarily to view the problem of social cohesion through the narrow lens of immigration. But the report’s authors suggest a far wider set of factors is at play, from the remote-working legacy of the pandemic to the paradoxically isolating effects of social media, which leave us too often alone with a phone. Significantly, given Reform’s success in the most deprived parts of England and Wales, they also identify a class dimension to the weakening of communal ties and diminishing levels of social trust. According to More in Common’s director, Luke Tryl, “a pernicious graduate gap appears to be opening up, with those who have degrees generally feeling more connected and optimistic than those who don’t.”The decline in associational life has been decades in the making. Far fewer of us now go to church, are members of a union or join social clubs. Political parties, once embedded in the life of communities, have become more detached from them and lessrepresentativeof their varied social makeup. Deindustrialisation, and thecultural shiftsof the Thatcher/Reagan era in the 1980s, inaugurated a more individualist age. The savage austerityinflictedby George Osborne in the 2010s degraded the public realm, closing leisure centres, libraries, youth clubs and arts centres. Inevitably, the loss of free or cheap social spaces hit the less well off hardest.According to Prof Putnam, this was the kind of context that helped deliver Donald Trump in the United States, as a swath of the population lost faith in the social contract and became “vulnerable to authoritarian populist appeals”. There have been warning signals in Britain too. The riots and disorder last summer, in the aftermath of the appalling murder of three young girls in Southport, took place in some of the mostdeprivedareas of the country.Together with Citizens UK and UCL academics led by Ed Miliband’s former speechwriter, Marc Stears, More in Common islaunchinga joint research project dedicated to finding ways to strengthen our fraying social bonds. Labour should pay close attention to its work. Thus far, the government’s programme of national renewal has focused overwhelmingly on the need to stimulate economic growth, within the unnecessarily constricting confines of its fiscal rules. But fostering the connections that bind people together in our towns and cities should be an equal priority.

Still Bazball 2.0? The start of Bazball 3.0? GivenBen Stokeshas knocked the grog on the head this year, perhaps it should be Bazball 0.0% ABV.Although, jokes aside,that recent revelationon one of those man-chat podcasts said a fair bit about Stokes’s nature. Not only has he temporarily paused drinking during his recovery from hamstring surgery but, so taken by this, he has even bought shares in an alcohol-free spirits company. England’s Test captain is someone who, when he sets his mind on something, sees it through to the extreme. Even abstinence.Ben Stokes targets No 1 spot in world Test rankings: ‘One more place to go’Read moreWhat then of the team that has lived and breathed the Stokes fumes these past three years? After something of a white-knuckle ride, and a few external grumbles about their chiefly gung-ho approach, 2025 pretty much represents the moment of truth: five Tests at home to India and then five away in Australia, with a one-off Test against Zimbabwe that starts in Nottingham on Thursday serving as the launchpad.Does this risk over-egging it? After all, Brendon McCullumextended his contractas head coach last summer, expanding it to include the white-ball sides and the 50-over World Cup in 2027. The next edition of the World Test Championship will not even be halfway done by the end of the Ashes and there is a T20 World Cup early next year for Harry Brook, the new limited-overs skipper, to sink his teeth into. In theory, Rob Key’s Baz-project is intended to go far longer.But then if the history of English cricket tells us anything – and a reminder came only last winter with the women’s team and a bloodbath in Australia that forced a change of captain and coach – it is that these things tend to operate in accordance with the Ashes cycle. Whatever iteration of Bazball this is, its place in history – and a few jobs in the set-up – will likely be defined by the Test results over the next nine months.Rewind to 2022 and, as per Stokes, the players were initially told to simply “cause some chaos”. The subsequent win-loss graph has had more than a touch of bitcoin about it but right now it looks pretty healthy: the most recent update of the ICC Test rankings has shaved off the final results of the previous period under Joe Root and Chris Silverwood and has England in second place. It makes sense, too, with 22 wins and 12 defeats in this time a ratio that only Australia, in first, have bettered.View image in fullscreenBen Stokes has not turned out for Durham this season and is still working back to full fitness.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAUnlike four years ago, when Silverwood spoke openly about India at home being used to “galvanise” the team before that winter’s visit to Australia (and saw the words blow up in his face), Stokes and McCullum are trying to play it cool before the ascent. On Wednesday Stokes acknowledged the significance of the year ahead, spoke about theNo 1 ranking being an aim, but stressed that all the focus is on Zimbabwe and a Test match that, even cut to four days, has been 22 years in the making.Seeing the tourists lose to a team of rookies last week did not point to a stiff workout, with the bookmakers making England heavy favourites. And so what performances in this match mean is tricky to place, with Stokes heavily hinting that Jacob Bethell, the breakout star in New Zealand last winter, but currently at the Indian Premier League, will come straight back into the side to face India regardless. The question – and one Ollie Pope would probably like to know the answer to – is where?Pope is still the vice-captain, said Stokes, but he will also be aware that, while Bethell’s stock was shooting up, his own appeared to be on the wane. Equally, with Bethell said to be open to, err, opening, it may be that Zak Crawley is also looking over his shoulder and something of a bat-off with Pope is taking place this week. The difference, however, is that Pope’s numbers against India and Australia drop off compared with his overall record, while Crawley’s have grown during his last two outings against them. Runs against Zimbabwe might not change the internal perception.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sam Cook makes his Test debut – stellar domestic numbers and injury to Chris Woakes opening the door – and will share the new ball with last year’s breakout quick, Gus Atkinson.Then there is a return for Josh Tongue after an 18-month injury ordeal, offering pace, movement and an awkward angle. With Brydon Carse approaching full fitness and Woakes about to make his county return – but Mark Wood out for the summer and Jofra Archer out for four weeks with a hand injury – an oversupply here would be welcome.Plenty comes back to Stokes, however. Having not turned out for Durham this season, this week is as much about the captain’s bowling and bridging the gap between training fit and match fit. If needs be, Stokes will also play for the Lions against India A next month. When the hamstring tore for the second time last winter, Stokes was in defiant mood, declaring he would “fuck shit up” the next time he took the field. That moment has arrived but it may be that, initially, temperance is the way to go.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamBen StokesBrendon McCullumZimbabwe Cricket TeamCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And no doubt, Edwards will be pleased that her reign began with an eight-wicket win, especially as this was a homecoming of sorts for the former Kent captain.But while England experienced their first taste of victory in five months – spearheaded by a career-best unbeaten 81 from Sophia Dunkley, and featuring a wicket on debut for the 27-year-old Warwickshire seamer Em Arlott – there was only one star of Wednesday’s show: West Indies captain Hayley Matthews, who calmly brought up a century off the final ball of the visitors’ innings.England beat West Indies by eight wickets: first women’s T20 cricket international – as it happenedRead moreAn unbeaten 100 out of a team total of 146; 16 boundaries to Matthews while her teammates scored just five between them. Matthews is by now used to bearing the weight of the team she has captained for three years – epitomised by her refusal to take singles in the final over here, as she eyed up three figures – but the sensation is currently heightened by the mysterious absence of Deandra Dottin, who was omitted from the West Indies squad for this tour without explanation.“We’ve obviously got a very young group that played today,” Matthews said. “We’re missing so many of our experienced campaigners. We’ve got girls coming in from the domestic setup for the first time and I think it’s such a steep climb coming to international cricket. It is going to be tough for them sometimes.”If England had looked all at sea in the field against these same opponents in the World Cup last October, here the tables were turned, with two West Indian batters run out and the rest swinging wildly. None looked more clueless than the 20-year-old debutant Realeanna Grimmond, who was run out after obliviously wandering out of her ground.Matthews offered an explanation of sorts: “I was actually shouting, ‘keeper’s end, stay in your crease’. She thought I was saying, ‘look for two’. Maybe a bit of miscommunication and lack of awareness.”View image in fullscreenHayley Matthews secured her hundred with the final ball of the West Indies innings.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAEngland, in reply, strolled to victory – the only downbeat note being the duck scored by their new skipper, who edged a sweep behind and was sent packing by a smart West Indies DRS review. On the other side of the balance sheet, though, was the chanceless knock of 43 not out from her predecessor Heather Knight, seemingly quite content to find herself back in the ranks.If Edwards wanted to make a statement that things have changed since the disaster of the Ashes winter, she could scarcely have made a stronger one: a cap for Arlott; Issy Wong back playing in a full-strength England side after a two-year absence; leg-spinner Sarah Glenn on the bench; and the previously ever-present Sophie Ecclestone not even named in the squad.And her players responded in kind: England’s nemesis Qiana Joseph – who was dropped five times en route to the half-century which sent England packing from the 2024 World Cup – was dismissed at the first time of asking, well held by Linsey Smith at point. Sciver-Brunt then helped herself to catches at deep midwicket and cover, handing Wong and Arlott a wicket apiece, while Lauren Bell held on to a stunner at short fine leg.Rain clouds had earlier threatened to disrupt this match – but for now, the sun shines on England’s new-look era. They go again on Friday, in the second T20 at Hove.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's cricket teamWest Indies WomenTwenty20Women's cricketCricketShareReuse this content"

He has managed only 10 goals, has not scored since January and was only a 76th-minute replacement inSaturday’s 1-0 FA Cup final defeatby Crystal Palace.The Joy of Six: Kevin De Bruyne at Manchester CityRead moreFoden sustained ankle ligament damage when tackled by Casemiro duringthe goalless draw at Old Traffordon 6 April, being forced off on 57 minutes.“It’s been difficult,” the 24-year-old said. “I picked up an ankle injury against United and it took time to heal before I could push myself back in training. A lot of people don’t know what football players have to go through and play with. I’ve had a lot of ankle pain and played with it in the last couple of months.“It’s been a frustrating season. I’ve had a lot of things going on off the pitch mentally. Sometimes there’s things in life bigger than football. This season I’ve struggled a little bit. Hopefully come next year I can get my head mentally right, get back where I left the season before because I know what I’m capable of doing and the quality I have.”Foden has been supported by City. “Definitely,” he said. “The club has been so supportive. I can’t thank them enough. I know if everything was OK [off the pitch] I’d definitely be better on the field. Sometimes things happen and you have to deal with it and move on. Now it’s about improving and getting back to my best. I know my standards and what I can reach.”City fly to the US on 12 June for the Fifa Club World Cup. Foden was asked whether he would prefer a break.“It’s obviously difficult because the lads are mentally drained from this season,” he said. “I believe everyone needs the right time to recover. There will be this competition. It’s going to be a funny one: some clubs will take it more seriously than others but I know we’ll definitely take it seriously.“It’s going to be something new, I don’t know much about it; I’ve left it in the back of my head until the season’s finished.

It’s something we have to speak about with the club and national team to see if it’s maybe better to rest and get my ankle fully 100% back.“I just need a few weeks off without playing football and I can’t get it at the moment.

Over four days, competitors will race, lift and swim with full access to drugs and therapies banned in virtually every other elite athletic setting.On your marks, get set, dope! Welcome to the Enhanced Games – the sporting event no one wants | Marina HydeRead moreBilled as a revolution in sport and science, the event aims to embrace what organizers call “superhumanity” – a future where pharmaceutical and technological enhancement is normalized in elite competition. But while promoters cast it as a bold break from the past, critics are already raising alarms about safety, fairness and the fundamental integrity of sport.“We are creating a new category of human excellence,” the Enhanced Games’ promotional materials declare. “A world where performance-enhancing drugs are used safely, openly, and under medical supervision.”The pitch is simple but radical: rather than penalize athletes for using banned substances, normalize and study their use in a medically supervised environment. Under the Enhanced model, athletes can either compete naturally, follow independent enhancement protocols, or participate in a clinical trial using FDA-approved drugs designated as “Investigational Medicinal Products”.The event’s founder, the London-based Australian entrepreneur Aron D’Souza, argues that current anti-doping policies are outdated and hypocritical. “The Enhanced Games is renovating the Olympic model for the 21st century,” he said. “In the era of accelerating technological and scientific change, the world needs a sporting event that embraces the future – particularly advances in medical science.”Organizers promise extensive medical screening, individualized health profiling and oversight by independent scientific and ethics boards. But athletes will not be subject to traditional anti-doping tests. Instead, they must disclose what substances they’re using – a model that some critics warn resembles “don’t ask, don’t tell” for doping in sport.The first Games will be held at Resorts World in Las Vegas and feature sprinting, swimming and weightlifting. Prize money is substantial: up to $500,000 per event, including a $1m bonus for breaking the 100m sprint or 50m freestyle world records.That may not be a theoretical reward. In February, Greek-Bulgarian swimmer Kristian Gkolomeev recorded a time of 20.89sec in the 50m freestyle – 0.02sec faster than the official world record,which has stood since 2009– reportedly while following an enhancement protocol for the first time. The swim, held at a certified pool under Olympic-level oversight, was filmed for a forthcoming promotional documentary.Yet even this demonstration comes with caveats. Gkolomeev wore a full-body polyurethane suit not approved by Fina, swimming’s international governing body. Organizers claim the suit was commercially available and not decisive in the performance – but its inclusion underscores the ethical gray areas the Enhanced Games are poised to explore.More fundamentally, many observers are uneasy with the concept itself.View image in fullscreenAron D’Souza, founder and president of Enhanced Games. photographed at Paviline Kensington, London.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer“As we have seen through history, performance-enhancing drugs have taken a terrible physical and mental toll on many athletes. Some have died,” the World Anti-Doping Agency said in a statement. “Clearly this event would jeopardize [athletes’ health and well-being] by promoting the abuse of powerful substances and methods that should only be prescribed, if at all, for specific therapeutic needs.”Travis Tygart, CEO of the US Anti-Doping Agency, was even more blunt. “It’s a dangerous clown show, not real sport,” he said.‘Imagine if a 60-year-old broke Usain Bolt’s record’: the story behind the Enhanced Games, the Olympics where everyone dopesRead moreThe Enhanced Games are also attracting attention, and controversy, due to the event’s supporters. Thelatest funding round, reportedly in the millions, includes investment from 1789 Capital, a firm led by Donald Trump Jr, Omeed Malik and Chris Buskirk. Other co-leads include Apeiron Investment Group and Karatage, a hedge fund with stakes in cryptocurrency and AI ventures. Avideo announcing the fundingsuggests Donald Trump’s endorsement.D’Souza described the involvement of Trump-aligned investors as a natural fit. “I’ve had the great fortune of working alongside many members of the administration and other prominent figures of the Trump movement over the years,” he said in February. “To know that some of the most significant figures in American social and political life support the Enhanced Games is more important to us than any investment.”Peter Thiel, the tech billionaire known for his libertarian politics and backing of controversial biotech ventures, is also listed as a major investor and “close advisor”, according to D’Souza.The participation of such figures has drawn further scrutiny from critics who view the Enhanced Games as not only a break from the Olympic model, but a calculated provocation – a challenge to elite sporting institutions, anti-doping agencies and what D’Souza has called the “anti-science” bent of legacy sports governance.Organizers maintain they are not trying to overwrite Olympic records or discredit traditional sport. Instead, they frame the Enhanced Games as a parallel category, akin to the professionalization of sport in the 20th century. The goal, they argue, is to explore the boundaries of human potential while provoking a broader cultural conversation.It’s an ambitious vision – and a high-stakes gamble.Athletes from around the world are being recruited, including some who felt alienated by anti-doping regimes. Former swimming world champion James Magnussen is among them, though the Australian’s recent enhanced attempts fell short of record times.The organizers, now headquartered in New York, say they will not tolerate abuse of illicit substances. Drugs must be legally prescribed and athletes must be medically fit to compete. Still, enforcement appears to rely more on partnership than oversight – a feature, not a bug, according to the Enhanced team.“There are always risks in elite sport,” reads one of the Games’ internal FAQs. “We believe the greater risk is pretending those risks don’t exist.”Whether the public buys into that logic remains to be seen. Organizers say they are in talks with major sponsors and streaming platforms, but have not confirmed any broadcast partners or marquee athletes beyond a handful of early adopters. If backlash builds – from federations, governments or regulators – it’s unclear whether the model will survive its first test.For now, though, the Enhanced Games are moving ahead, armed with a defiant slogan: Live Enhanced.Whether the world embraces that vision or recoils from it may determine not just the future of one event, but the ethical limits of sport itself.Explore more on these topicsDrugs in sportUS sportsDonald Trump JrPeter ThielSwimmingAthleticsWeightliftingnewsShareReuse this content"

Having won the first set, Raducanu was 5-0 down when she called a medical timeout before returning to the court 10 minutes later. Although she was able to finish the match, she lost 4-6, 6-1, 6-3 to Collins.Drop by drop: Carlos Alcaraz leads shift back to the most deft shot in tennisRead moreWith the French Open starting on Sunday, Raducanu will now have the problem fully assessed before travelling to Paris, though the way she competed hard in a tight third set could suggest it was not too serious. She took a wildcard in eastern France to enter the final warm-up tournament for Roland Garros – not something she has usually done in the buildup to a grand slam.The British No 2, who is chasing Katie Boulter as the highest-ranked Briton, started off well by winning the first set against the world No 46. But her level immediately dropped and after walking through the fifth game, where she went 5-0 down, she left the court for lengthy treatment.Collins quickly wrapped up the second set and there was a fear she could also run away with the decider. But to her credit, Raducanu fought hard and was primed to take a 3-1 lead but could not convert four break points. It was tightly poised at 3-3 after an exchange of breaks, but Collins put her foot down to win the final three games as Raducanu fell away.Raducanu has added an extra tournament to her grass-court schedule after taking a wildcard into the BerlinTennisOpen. The former US Open champion will begin her campaign on the surface at the new WTA event at Queen’s Club next month before heading to the German capital for the tournament from 16-22 June.That means Raducanu will not be joining Boulter at the Nottingham Open, which takes place the same week. The Berlin tournament is a higher tier of the WTA Tour and therefore offers more ranking points and prize money. Raducanu will face fierce competition in Germany, with a stacked field led by world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka, and featuring nine of the top 10. Naomi Osaka, the four-time grand slam champion, has also been given a wildcard.Novak Djokovic, who is seeking his 100th career title on the ATP Tour, finally won a match on clay this season, beating Marton Fucsovics 6-2, 6-3 in the second round at the rainy Geneva Open.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic was in control at the Geneva Open.Photograph: Cyril Zingaro/EPA“My first win this season on clay obviously, it’s great to break the ice in a way. It’s a very demanding surface,” Djokovic said. He faced no break-point chances, landed 73% of his first serves and clinched the contest with a backhand winner on his second match point.“It helps if you have a good serve and today I think that was my strongest shot,” Djokovic added.The 37-year-old lost his two previous matches on clay, and his next opponent at the last warm-up event before the French Open is one of the players who beat him. He is scheduled to play Matteo Arnaldi who earlier advanced past Fabian Marozsan 6-3, 7-6 (3).

He made a fine debut off the benchagainst Wales in Cardiff, scoring two tries in a 32-minute cameo.As a back-rower Pollock is in arguably the most competitive position in Farrell’s squad with Tom Curry, Ben Earl, Jac Morgan, Josh van der Flier and Jack Conan for company. But he would join a select group of players that includes Jason Robinson and Jamie George should he make his first Test start for the Lions rather than England.“Nobody would bet against that,” said Borthwick. “There’s fierce competition there because Ben Earl’s another player who’s played really well for England for two or three years now. He’s been exceptional. I think the depth of the player talent there is what makes it such an exciting squad and an exciting series.“What struck is that each and every level [Henry] steps up to, he really embraces that challenge. I sense he’s somebody who just jumps all into it and doesn’t contemplate it too much. Simply jumps into it and embraces the contest. And I expect him to do the same again this summer.“When you look at how quickly he’s grown from starting at the Six Nations in our training camp, then playing a couple of games with the under-20s, to then joining our training camp again and then playing at the end of the Six Nations. The form he’s played in Northampton since the end of that and in some of the biggest games, he’s performed brilliantly. He’s clearly an incredibly talented player who just loves the challenge.”View image in fullscreenHenry Pollock cuts loose against Wales in Cardiff, where he scored two tries on his England debut.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PAAfter their positive Six Nations campaign, Pollock is one of 13 England players in the Lions squad – captained by Maro Itoje – while Richard Wigglesworth is the first assistant coach seconded from England’s staff since Borthwick, for the tour to New Zealand in 2017. Borthwick has not yet discussed standby players with Andy Farrell but is anticipating further call-ups in the summer when England are touring Argentina and the US and is planning to pick a 36-man squad as a result.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A contract worth £150,000 a week has been put forward. Talks with several other clubs are anticipated and it is understood that Chelsea and Newcastle have been wooing the 22-year-old behind closed doors.Chelsea determined to keep Enzo Fernández despite Real Madrid interestRead moreNewcastle are looking to add more depth to a small squad and are understood to have made it clear that they feel that Delap can play in tandem with their star forward, Alexander Isak. Eddie Howe will also need a quality alternative to Isak – who is reportedly set to undergo groin surgery at the end of the season – if Newcastle seal qualification for the Champions League this weekend.Delap has enjoyed a breakout campaign since leaving Manchester City last summer, scoring 12 goals in 39 appearances, and represents an affordable option for any club looking to sign a striker this summer. There is no chance of him staying at Ipswich, who had looked into renegotiating the terms of his departure at one stage but are now resigned to him leaving. A deal within weeks would allow all sides clarity well before pre-season. At least one interested club have seen their hopes of signing Delap dashed after being made aware that he wants to play at the highest possible level.Chelsea have a policy of signing young players and like the England Under-21 international. They have alternatives and it has been suggested they will prioritise a move for the RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko if they qualify for the Champions League.Sesko has interest from elsewhere, including Arsenal, but has been tracked by Chelsea for three years. The 21-year-old Slovenia international has scored 26 goals for club and country this season.Delap is well known to United’s technical director, Jason Wilcox, from their time at City. United are also pushing to seal the signing of the Wolves forward Matheus Cunha and have considered Eintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitike, Napoli’s Victor Osimhen and Sporting’s Viktor Gyökeres.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowIpswich TownChelseaNewcastle UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

He had been serving in the army for six years and, as a native of the almost entirely occupied Luhansk region, knew the price of war better than most. It was soon to take a horrifying toll from him. Moskal stepped on a landmine shortly after the rotation and life changed irrevocably. The evacuation procedure went smoothly, in the circumstances, but his lower left leg could not be saved. It was hard not to think dark thoughts after two operations; tougher still given a prosthetic was nowhere on the horizon.Now it is mid-May. Wearing the red, yellow-trimmed shirt of FK Khrestonostsi, Moskal puffs out his cheeks before sitting in the dugout. He props his crutch against the neighbouring seat. The second half of the final is starting and he will take a breather. He smiles at his wife, Alina, who watches from the front row. This time he has remembered to wear his talisman, a metallic cross fastened around his neck, and he tells her it is the reason for his two goals. Soon he will almost certainly win his first football tournament. “Rest up or you won’t be able to lift the trophy,” a teammate advises.View image in fullscreenKonstantyn Moskal (pictured) used to prefer boxing to football before his injury on Ukraine’s frontline.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianHow can life ever compensate for the loss of something so fundamental? Almost everyone playing here is grappling with that question. The “League of the Mighty”, a competition created by the Ukrainian FA for its amputees, is trying to offer some kind of answer. BeforeRussia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine had no more than 10 registered amputee footballers. Now there are 170, which is about 15% of Europe’s total. Estimates suggest as many as50,000 people have lost limbsowing to the war.Moskal’s second surgery took place in Lutsk, in the country’s north-west. On another of those long, exacting days at the rehabilitation centre, he saw an advert on social media: Khrestonostsi (Crusaders) had formed there at the end of December and sought new recruits. He had previously been more into boxing, but a return to physical activity could not come quickly enough. If those around him were surprised, they knew not to suggest it was too soon. Within days Ihor Lytvynenko, a former Paralympian footballer who had been appointed the new club’s coach, drove to the centre and picked him up for training.“I don’t think he would feel the same comfort anywhere else that he does among this group,” says Lytvynenko, a kindly and soft-spoken figure. “This is all about a community: guys with similar issues who come together and support each other.”0:48MSK Dnipro play Pokrova in League of the Mighty amputee football tournament – videoEight teams are competing here in a tidy little ground close to the national stadium. The two-day tournament’s first edition was held in January. There are five in the Super League and a further three newcomers, including Khrestonostsi, playing for the First League trophy. Potential future competitors have been invited to take part in demonstrations and the expectation is that a fully fledged national league will begin later this year.‘Like a piece of a past life’: Shakhtar’s cup final win offers Ukraine hopeRead more“It’s about emotional gain, helping them rediscover this will to live,” says Bohdan Melnyk, the event’s development manager. “In some cases they’re now doing something they weren’t able to before their injuries. The key thing is that we don’t kick anyone out of a team. If you want to play, come to training and let’s do it. Everyone can try, we’ll always encourage each other.”Melnyk is speaking before the team he founded, Pokrova, take the field for a Super League match against Dnipro. Based in Lviv, Pokrova started out in September 2023 and have set a standard for the ecosystem Ukraine’s football authorities are creating. They were quickly accepted into Poland’s amputee Ekstraklasa league and are able to bring two teams here, along with support staff and a small group of supporters who chant to a drumbeat.Players come from as far as Odesa and Mykolaiv, 11 hours away by car, to represent Pokrova. Their expenses are paid. Everyone has their own tale of service, loss and hope. David, a Colombian soldier, travelled from his home city Barranquilla to fight for Ukraine. He lost a leg when a mine exploded near Kharkiv; now he plays for their second team and sits among them watching other games unfold. The jokes and repartee flow; he keeps up as best he can, for someone who barely speaks Ukrainian or English, and takes his turn on the drum. Football offers some level of certainty in what would otherwise be a strange and isolated existence.Then there is the bearded Andriy Mandryk, who Melnyk views as a shining example of what amputee football can achieve. Mandryk went through 25 surgical interventions after being injured near the front, eventually requiring a leg amputation. “He was in a really sad state and we invited him to training,” Melnyk says.View image in fullscreenDavid (left) joins in with the Pokrova supporters’ drum section.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The Guardian“He came and could barely walk on crutches: he brought his three-year-old daughter and was scared of falling, especially in front of her. Then I took the ball, kicked it towards the little girl and told her to pass it to her father. They started to play between themselves, and that’s how I first saw him smile after his injury. Now he’s the soul of the party and a totally different person.”Standing outside Pokrova’s dressing room, Mandryk calmly recounts how an Iskander rocket attack led to his appalling ordeal. He had been a goalkeeper in the same futsal team as Melnyk before becoming an army captain. “In the beginning it was hard but I’m almost there physically as a player,” says the 25-year-old Mandryk. “This is such an important rehabilitation for veterans. Without this kind of activity it’s not hard to start drinking or doing drugs.”Shakhtar Donetsk are here too, in the form of their well-developed Shakhtar Stalevi side. One of their players, Andriy Herasymchuk, was injured close to Kherson in October 2022. He had rarely played football before but is now a pillar of the side and training to be a referee. “Life is movement,” he says. “You need to move in order to stay alive. I’m just trying to do that.”There is no lack of activity on the pitch, which is scaled down to roughly two-thirds its regular size and provides the stage for two seven-a-side teams. This is a sport dependent on upper body strength: the ability to propel yourself, using a specially adapted support, around the surface and generate enough backlift to circulate the ball or shoot. The players’ impairments do not diminish their ingenuity and sheer skill, whether manifested in passing patterns, intuitive flicks, swift breaks or shot placement. One flicked finish in Pokrova’s win over Shakhtar brings the house down. Because this is present-day Ukraine, the subsequent break is prolonged by an air raid siren.Knocks and calls for treatment are common. Residual limb pain, affecting the remaining part of a leg or arm, can be agonising and blows to those regions are keenly felt given prosthetics are not worn. It is hard to get through a 50-minute game. Moskal has been struggling with such an issue from training and takes assistance from a colleague in applying freezing spray midway through Khrestonostsi’s opening match against Vinnytsia. His teammate, Vova, takes a nasty looking fall during the game.“Suka!”(“Bitch!”) exclaims Vova’s wife, Marina. “Don’t swear, this is going out on YouTube,” comes a voice from behind.The entire weekend is a slick production, VAR even being deployed to resolve penalty calls on a couple of occasions. Nobody hoped Ukraine would need to develop an advanced amputee football infrastructure but, now that the need is here and will only grow, the model being constructed looks serious, detailed and inclusive. Women are being integrated, a handful turning out for the Kyiv side Burevi.View image in fullscreenTetiana Matseshyna plays for Kyiv’s Burevi.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianMoskal, a dynamic presence on the right flank, returns for a cameo towards the end of the final. There is to be no hat-trick but Khrestonostsi have done more than enough, overcoming the Kharkiv-Dnipro side Nezlamni 3-0 and taking a prize that, for numerous reasons, nobody in the team could have envisaged winning. “I’m incredibly proud of my boys, they gave it everything,” says a visibly emotional Lytvynenko. “We’d never played on a big pitch, or on grass, before. The kits and boots weren’t worn in. It’s all new for us.”Khrestonostsi warm down and return to watch Pokrova win the Super League by comprehensively beating Shakhtar. As the minutes tick away, the stadium comes to its feet for a rendition of the national anthem. When the final whistle blows, flares light up in the stand. One wonders how and when these men will be able to fully reckon with the drastic change, the crushing deprivations and the colourful new possibilities they have been dealt.Standing on the winners’ podium at last, an exhausted Moskal holds up Khrestonostsi’s flag. He grins broadly, shyly, and receives his medal, handing it to Alina with a kiss after alighting. Victory means the team will receive a special reception with the mayor of Lutsk. In the coming days, Alina will join Moskal there and the pair will set up home for good. Plans will be made for a new life that already holds clear promise.View image in fullscreenFK Khrestonostsi (Crusaders) lift their trophy.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The Guardian“I need to recuperate and then we’ll see what’s next,” Moskal says afterwards. “It makes sense to feel happy, alive and celebrate moments like this. But at the same time, we must remember that we’re able to do it because of the guys who are out there, fighting for us.” Like everyone here, he has known both sides of a redemptive story whose complexities will endure.Explore more on these topicsFootballDisability and sportUkrainefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The hardware startup, called io, was founded by Apple design guru Jony Ive, known best as one of the principal architects of the iPhone. Ive and OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, said in ablog postthat their partnership has been two years in the making.“A collaboration built upon friendship, curiosity and shared values quickly grew in ambition,” they wrote in the blog post, which offered scant details on upcoming devices. “Tentative ideas and explorations evolved into tangible designs.”OpenAI’s purchase of io is its biggest known acquisition yet. Ive and a cohort of otherApplealumni founded io one year ago, according to the blog post. It is part of Ive’s bigger project called LoveFrom, which describes itself as a “creative collective” made up of architects, artists, engineers, various types of designers, musicians and writers.Ive left Apple in 2019 after a 27-year career as one of the company’s foremost product designers. He’s known forsimple and clean aestheticsthat pay attention to small details like packaging and font. One of his early famous designs was the brightly colored bubble-shaped iMac computer. From there, he went on to design the first iPod, iPhone, MacBook Air, Apple Watch and AirPods.For his work on creating such distinctive products, Ive wasknighted by Princess Anneat Buckingham Palace in 2012, a moment he called “thrilling” and “particularly humbling”.In Altman and Ive’s blog post on Wednesday, they wrote that the io team will merge with OpenAI to work “more intimately with the research, engineering and product teams in San Francisco”. Ive himself will not join OpenAI as an employee, but his company will “take over design for all of OpenAI, including its software”, according toBloomberg.Since leaving Apple and starting LoveFrom, Ive has mostly remained quiet, and io has not debuted any hardware. His company’s list of clients reportedly includes Christie’s, Airbnb and Ferrari, though. Another project Ive has been working on is LoveFrom’s headquarters in San Francisco, according to theNew York Times. Ives told the paper he is designing the headquarters of the company he is developing with OpenAI.OpenAI has likewise yet to unveil a hardware device, but it has indicated it is heading in that direction. It has hired hardware and robotics staff, including Caitlin “CK” Kalinowski, who headed Meta’saugmented reality glassesinitiative. In her LinkedIn announcement, Kalinowski wrote that her new role at OpenAI is to focus on “robotics work and partnerships to help bring AI into the physical world”. OpenAI has also invested in the robot startupPhysical Intelligence, which aims to bring “general-purpose AI into the physical world”.Investors have been throwing money at OpenAI over the past couple of years, which is now valued at $300bn, according to Bloomberg. In March, it closed a funding round of $40bn led by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. Microsoft has a 49% stake in the AI company after investing $13bn in 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The barrister, who specialised in children’s cases, was aware of the abuse but failed to intervene.The court found the children were subjected to physical assaults, denied proper meals and that a lock was placed on the pantry to stop them helping themselves to food.Punishments designed to humiliate included locking them outside the house without shoes on or making them stand against a wall. One child had his head flushed down the toilet and was referred to as “a disease”. Another had his spectacles confiscated to prevent him from reading.Both parents deny the allegations but did not seek to challenge them.In ajudgment published todayTheis said the arguments put forward on each side relating to the issue of anonymity were compelling but was ultimately in the best interests of the children.At the heart of the case are three boys who find themselves back in the care system after suffering significant harm at the hands of their parents.Usually it is in the interests of children who have been the subject of abuse to keep the identity of their family confidential.In this case however, there were welfare arguments put forward on behalf of the children in favour of naming the parents. These included that identifying them would serve to validate their experiences and refute anything later made public by the parents who dispute the allegations and previously threatened to “one day fight for justice”.Initially the guardian for the younger two boys, appointed by the court to represent their best interests, supported the naming of the parents in court judgments but shifted her position to neutral just over a week before a hearing in April.It came after the parents said they would be willing to have contact with the children on the condition their identities were protected. Previously they had been resolute about not seeing them despite being aware of the boys’ wishes to do so.It was submitted there was significant public interest in naming the parents due to the jobs each had held during the time of the abuse. Both worked in roles that brought them into direct contact with children, while the judge was making important decisions about their welfare.Theis said the balancing exercise was “exquisitely poised” and that TBIJ had set out “powerful arguments” supported by other media organisations.However, she ultimately decided in favour of the children’s rights to privacy. She said their welfare needs were best achieved away from the glare of any publicity.The two younger siblings left the family home in January 2024 and reported to police they had been abused by the teacher. The older sibling, who was separately represented in the court proceedings, and was already in foster care at that time, also disclosed abuse.One boy told police the teacher had pushed him against a wall, put their hands around his throat and threatened to kill him. He also said he had been made to wear shoes that were too small for him and that he’d been subjected to racial slurs, including the “N-word”.Theis said the children were caused further significant harm as a result of delays to the court process, caused “in very large part” to the conduct of the parents who said they suffered from fragile mental health.A police investigation into the teacher and barrister, who were bailed after being arrested, was closed in July 2024 and no charges were brought.Explore more on these topicsChildrenDomestic violencePrivacy & the medianewsShareReuse this content"

In January, the rival bank Barclays ordered all staff to work from the office for at least three days a week, up from a previous requirement of two days. Last year Santander told employees they must be in the office for at least three days a week.HSBC’s UK division, which is headquartered in Birmingham, introduced its requirement for staff to spend 60% of their time, about three days on average, in the office in 2023. It employs about 23,000 staff in its offices and branches.The lender told staff that line managers would monitor attendance more closely and adherence to the policy would form part of an employee’s annual performance review, the Financial Times reported.Theconsultancy PwC told employees in September that it would start tracking their working locationto ensure they met the mandate of working in the office or at client sites three days a week.Meanwhile, on Wall Street there have been reports that BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset management company, is preparing to order its senior managers to work from the office five days a week. The investment bank JP Morgan Chase has already summoned all its staff back into the office.Citigroup is one of the few Wall Street banks this year that has told itsstaff that they can work remotely two days a week.Although there was an initial push after the pandemic to get workers back into the office,28% of working adults in Great Britain still had hybrid arrangementsin the autumn of 2024, according to official data.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The climate model ran on an IBM computer, the fastest in the world in the 1970s and so gargantuan it took up the entire second floor.But this storied history has meant little to the Trump administration, which is ending the lab’s lease on 31 May, releasing 130 staff to work from home with an uncertain future ahead. Donald Trump, who has called climate science “bullshit” and a “giant hoax” in the past, wants to slash Nasa’s Earthscience budget in half.“They are trying to kill the messenger with the bad news, it’s crazy,” said Dr James Hansen, known as the godfather of climate science and previously director of Giss for more than 30 years.The Guardian talked to Hansen, who was wearing a trademark felt fedora, as he tackled a plate of eggs and bacon at Tom’s Restaurant, which sits below the Giss office. The eggs, as well as some pancakes for your Guardian reporter, were ordered at the barked behest of the manager: “$12 minimum on food! $12! Each!”The diner is famous – its neon-lit exterior regularly appeared on Seinfeld (photos of Jerry, Kramer and Elaine, some signed, adorn the walls inside) and it inspired Suzanne Vega’s 1980s songTom’s Dinerand so is now regularly thronged by tourists as well as Columbia students, though perhaps less so by Giss staff.View image in fullscreenTom’s Restaurant in New York in 2015.Photograph: Roberto Machado Noa/LightRocket via Getty Images“Are they going to destroy this place? Are they bombing it?” said Hansen about the dismantling of the institution above where we were poking at our food. “That’s the approach of Doge [Elon Musk’s so-called ‘department of government efficiency’] to blow things up, to use a chainsaw,” he said. “That’s a big mistake because science isn’t something you start over. You’ve got a lot of knowledge there.”Hansen gave Congress and the world its first majorwarningof a climate crisis in 1988 but left Giss in 2013 to speak out more publicly about climate breakdown. Hislatent activismbecame so concerning to Nasa that, Hansen claims, it sought to install a camera outside his office to monitor his movements.Giss’s independence and nimbleness allowed it to chart the dangerous heating of our planet but also spurred resentment from senior officials who long desired to subsume it within Nasa’s mainGoddard space flight centercampus in Greenbelt, Maryland.“We survived under a non-supportive situation for decades,” Hansen said. “Somewhat it was a matter of jealousy, of scientists in Greenbelt thinking: ‘Why are these guys getting to this privileged position?’”Ironically for a place that has produced world-leading climate science for a tiny fraction of Nasa’s budget, however, it will be closed down ostensibly for efficiency reasons. Last month, the US president signed anexecutive ordercalling for a review of all leased federal office space, particularly in cities, to slash costs.“Over the next several months, employees will be placed on temporary remote work agreements whileNasaseeks and evaluates options for a new space for the Giss team,” a Nasa spokesperson said.Science isn’t something you start over. You’ve got a lot of knowledge thereDr James HansenIt’s unclear where, or if, such a space will eventuate. The move will likely not even save the federal government any money – the $3m a year lease is between Columbia and a different federal agency and cannot be broken early. Researchers, their books and equipment are being packed up and removed so that the US taxpayer can fund an empty building in New York City’s moneyed Upper West Side.“Ours is not to reason why,” said Gavin Schmidt, the current Giss director who noted the lab was only recently renovated at a cost of several million dollars. “It is frustrating.” The final weeks of Nasa’s time in Armstrong Hall, the name of the Columbia property, have been marked by team picnics with a farewell party planned among past and present staff.“There are a few wobbly lips, the contribution of this place to science has been huge and people are emotional about that,” Schmidt said.“Giss has a unique culture of autonomy, there’s a special sauce here that’s responsible for some really great science. Everyone knows why they are here – they could’ve gone anywhere else but they stay in an office that is dedicated to public service. Science for the public good is imbued in the floors and walls and elevators here.”‘A ruthless agenda’: charting 100 days of Trump’s onslaught on the environmentRead moreThe work will, for now, continue in a different, disparate form. “It’s doable but it is disruptive,” said Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at GISS. “People would rather be doing science than thinking about moving. This is a building full of nerds who love doing science, love learning new things about our planet.”But for how long, and from where? A best-case scenario could be that Giss goes into some sort of hibernation before being resurrected under a future administration. Or it could be a terminal end of an era, an apt outcome in an age of anti-enlightenment where climate science is torn fromwebsites,scientistsand theirworkare jettisoned,vaccinesand evenweather forecastingare eyed with suspicion and the president canopinethat therising seaswill happily create balmy new beachfront property.“I see this as an attack by this administration on climate science,” said Bastiaan van Diedenhoven, a researcher who worked at GISS for 13 years. “We were afraid of something like this because we saw what was happening at other agencies, so obviously Giss is on their list because of the good climate science done there. I don’t see how it can survive without a building. It’s really quite devastating.”After making the most of his eggs and bacon, Hansen wandered to the nondescript side-door that gains entry to Giss, to say hello to those who followed him. Shortly after he first came to Columbia, in 1967, the building’s second-floor windows were bricked up after student protestseruptedover the Vietnam war. Today a different sort of tumult is in the air – before Hansen can walk in he bumps into a Nasa scientist who is delighted to see him but then swiftly asks: “Do you have space somewhere where I can work?”Schmidt said he was unsure what comes next, but that he wouldn’t want to move to Maryland and that others at Giss will feel the same. “People have lives, some just won’t want to go,” he said. “The mission hasn’t changed, though. We’ve punched above our weight for a bunch of folks living above a diner in New York. We’ve had a good run. But it’s not over just yet.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentNasaClimate crisisNew YorkTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The behaviour could be a survival strategy that favours giving nectar and sugar to bees over so-called nectar robbers that do not offer plants any reproductive benefits.“There is growing evidence that both insects and plants can sense and produce, or transmit, vibro-acoustic signals,” said Prof Francesca Barbero, a zoologist at the University of Turin, who led the research.The findings add to the “truly astonishing” multitude of ways that plants can perceive their surroundings, including the presence of beneficial and harmful insects, temperature, drought and wind, Barbero added. In future, the team suggested, buzzing noises could be used on farms as an environmentally friendly way of enhancing the pollination of crops.The scientists are not yet sure how the plants might be listening in. They could rely on mechanoreceptors, cells that respond to mechanical stimulation such as touch, pressure or vibrations. “Plants do not have a brain, but they can sense the environment and respond accordingly,” said Barbero.After observing that bees and competing insects have distinct vibrational signals that are used in mating and other forms of communication, Barbero and her collaborators set out to investigate whether plants detected these signals.They played recordings near snapdragons of the buzzing sounds produced by snail-shell bees (Rhodanthidium sticticum), which are efficient snapdragon pollinators, comparing the plants’ response to sounds produced by a non-pollinating wasp and ambient sounds.The researchers found that in response to the snail-shell bee noises, the snapdragons increased the volume of nectar and its sugar content and showed altered expression in genes that govern sugar transport and nectar production.This could be an evolutionary adaptation to coax the pollinators into spending more time at the flowers. “The ability to discriminate approaching pollinators based on their distinctive vibro-acoustic signals could be an adaptive strategy for plants,” said Barbero.While it is clear that buzzing sounds can trigger nectar production, the scientists are now looking into whether sounds from plants are being used actively to draw in suitable pollinators.They are also testing whether the plant responses enhanced the attraction for all flower visitors – including nectar robbers – or only the best pollinators.“Our hypothesis is that the changes in nectar we observed after treating the plants with the sounds of the best pollinators specifically increase the attraction of this particular species (Rhodanthidium sticticum),” said Barbero. “However, to confirm this, we need to conduct choice tests to assess how different nectar concentrations attract various species.“If this response from insects is confirmed, sounds could be used to treat economically relevant plants and crops, and increase their pollinators’ attraction,” she said.The findings were presented on Wednesday at the joint 188th Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America and 25th International Congress on Acoustics in New Orleans.Explore more on these topicsPlantsBeesInsectsAnimalsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

SSE has also faced delays to the second phase of its Arklow Bank offshore windfarm off the Irish coast.The government had aimed to double the UK’s onshore wind power, triple its solar power, and quadruple its offshore wind capacity by 2030 as part of aplan to create a power system 95% free of fossil fuels.SSE had expected to help the government meet these goals by increasing its renewable energy generation fivefold to 50 terrawatt hours (TWh) by 2030. Its renewable energy generation output climbed by 18% last year to reach 13.3TWh in March of this year.SSE’s step back from renewable energy investment will enable the FTSE 100 energy group tofocus on investingin high-voltage power cables and local electricity distribution grids, which provide predictable, regulated returns.The company’s overall adjusted profits slipped by 3% to £2.14bn for the year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It adds a whole lot of uncertainty and tens of billions of pounds to the cost of getting to net zero by 2030. It also introduces – tragically – a potential postcode lottery on people’s bills,” he said.Explore more on these topicsRenewable energySSEEnergyWind powerHydropowerScotlandEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It’s time to sound the alarm.”He said developed countries should aim to do more of the refining of copper and other key metals needed for industry, and form partnerships with developing countries to do so.UK urged not to exploit poor countries in rush for critical mineralsRead moreCritical minerals that are necessary for manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines, and transforming the global energy system, are overwhelmingly being refined in China, though they aremined in many locations, including Africa, Australia and Latin America.China processes more than 70% on average of the world’s top 20 minerals needed in the energy industry, according to IEA data. Elements such as cobalt, gallium, lithium and manganese are used in the production of batteries and electrical componentsneeded for renewable energy generation.This stranglehold is increasing, even though the prices of many critical minerals have fallen from the highs of 2021 and 2022, when the shock of the Covid pandemic created a supply crunch. The average share of the top suppliers is expected to decline only marginally over the next decade.ChartBirol said more must be done to increase the supply of critical minerals if the world was to shift to a low-carbon economy.“Diversification is key,” he said. “The UK, Europe, Japan, the US, South Korea – the technology is there. Africa, Latin America have the resources. There could be international cooperation among countries.”Governments should intervene, as market forces alone would not solve the problem, he added. “There is a need for government policies, to support new entrants [in the market],” he said.Developing these industries and trade links woulddiversify the global supplyand could prevent bottlenecks and potential price rises, like those seen in 2021. “If the costs go up, that would be a major, if not the most important, hurdle” to shifting to a green economy, Birol said. “This is a major, major issue.”Copper must be a key concern, he added. It takes on average 17 years from the discovery of new deposits to theproduction of the metal.“We have analysed all the copper mining, in Latin America, Africa, Australia – all the pipelines,” said Birol. “[Rising costs would] make the cost of the green transition significantly higher, and may lead to delay.”But he said that if governments took rapid action, they could reduce the projected shortfall. “[A supply crunch] is not inevitable. We can soften it if we move very fast, by putting new projects to market very fast, by recycling copper, and substituting copper with other metals such as aluminium, to alleviate the problem.”ChartChina’s build-out of its electricity grids, as itmoves to clean energy and the manufacturing of clean technology componentssuch as solar panels and wind turbines, has been the biggest factor behind the sharp increase in demand for copper in recent years.The need for other critical minerals has also increased rapidly. Demand for lithium rose by nearly 30% last year.The IEA warned that any disruption to supply would be dangerous, not only for the green energy transition but also to the wider global economy.“The impact of a critical minerals supply shock can be far-reaching, bringing higher prices for consumers and reducing industrial competitiveness,”according to the report.“A sustained supply shock for battery metals could increase global average battery pack prices by as much as 40-50%.”Explore more on these topicsRenewable energyEnergyMining (Business)Solar powerWind powerCommoditiesMining (Environment)newsShareReuse this content"

Because it’s so small,” Lowe said.His comment triggered laughter in the room, and the person filming appeared to reassure him that the video would be edited. Someone out of shot said “career over in a second”, and Lowe laughed and repeated “career over in a second”.Contacted for a response, Lowe said: “I don’t recall saying that, but if it was said, it was clearly a joke as anybody reading it can understand.”A spokesperson for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said: “This is bizarre and outdated antisemitic language which has no place in our politics. Mr Lowe should apologise for the offence this remark has caused.”Reform declined to comment. The video is understood to have been recorded in February or March.Since he was suspended from Reform in March, Lowe has sat as an independent and has been toying with the idea ofstarting a new rightwing political partyor joining the Conservatives.Lowe indicated to BBC Newsnight last week that he was interested in either starting a new venture with funding from the US billionaire Elon Musk or joining a “reformed Tory party”. “I could join the Tories tomorrow if I wanted to. I don’t have an issue with the Tories,” he said.But he added he would “make sure there’s an alternative” to the existing parties and that he thought Musk “broadly, would consider supporting us”. “I can’t speak for him, but would I be grateful and would I feel good about his verbal support? Yes. Financial support? Yes. If he chose to do that, it would be fantastic,” Lowe said.Lowe, a former Brexit party MEP, lost the Reform whip a day after giving an interview where he criticised Farage and said that under his leadership Reform was a “protest party led by the Messiah”.Announcing his suspension, Reform made a string of allegations against Lowe, including that he was thesubject of bullying complaintsand hadthreatened the party chair, Zia Yusuf, with violence. The Crown Prosecution Service said last week it haddecided not to press chargesover the alleged verbal threats.Lowe has always denied wrongdoing andclaimed to be the victim of a witch-hunt. He has tried to clear his name, including by pursuinglegal action against Farage and Reform. He has claimed that Farage turned against him after Muskappeared to endorse Lowe to replace himas the leader of Reform.Musk said in January that Farage “doesn’t have what it takes” to lead Reform and appeared to suggest Lowe was a better candidate. “I have not met Rupert Lowe, but his statements online that I have read so far make a lot of sense,” Musk said at the time.Explore more on these topicsRupert LoweReform UKAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

Too few staff, with too little experience, managing too many cases, means inspections routinely reveal significant deficits in work to protect the public, and missed opportunities to tackle reoffending. The clock is ticking to address these issues, and we have seen no evidence of improvement.”Jones, a former chief executive of the Parole Board, said government plans will expose the public to greater risk.“My concern as chief inspector is that probation’s risk, unlike prisons, is carried directly in the community, which means avoidable mistakes can have catastrophic consequences. Therefore, any response to simply shift demand from prison to probation will be ineffective at best, and dangerous at worst.”The government must pile more resources in so there are more staff, with more experience, and with better services to tackle the underlying causes of offending, he said.“Detailed attention needs to be paid to ensuring the Probation Service has the capacity to cope with the work required, and the expertise and funding to ensure better delivery, interventions, and outcomes,” he said.Ministers must also cut through red tape and form-filling for probation officers if they are to spend more time monitoring dangerous criminals, he said.“The Probation Service will need to work much more closely and effectively with the police and other agencies to protect the public from harm. Our inspections find that complicated and ineffective systems too often prevent probation officers from communicating and sharing information about risk effectively,” he said.Gauke’s recommendations are expected to include allowing prisoners to earn their freedom after serving a third of their sentences under new minimum and maximum sentence plans.He will also say that magistrates should be encouraged to defer sentencing for some offenders for up to 12 months, instead of the current six, and encourage wider use of deferred sentences for pregnant women or those with substance dependencies.Reports this week claimed that the government had ordered tens of thousands of extra tags, which will be used to monitor offenders in the community. Gauke will call for suspended sentences to be made available for custodial sentences of up to three years, instead of the current two.Projections have shown that prisons are on course to run out of space by November.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceDavid GaukenewsShareReuse this content"

UK steel production fell in 2024 to its lowest since the 1930s, and in the last month the government in effecttook over the British Steel blast furnaces at Scunthorpe, amid fears of more than 2,700 job losses and the end of primary steel-making in the UK.British Steel to hire more staff weeks after government rescueRead moreLiberty Steel is ultimately owned by Sanjeev Gupta, whose GFG Alliance metals empire is under severe financial pressure across the world after a debt-fuelled expansion spree. Gupta has been battling for control of metals companies in the UKand Australiaagainst creditors led by the administrators forGreensill Capital, a lender that collapsed in 2021. Greensill had lent Gupta’s companies about $5bn (£3.7bn).The financial turmoil has left Liberty Steel’s UK plants unable to access cash needed to run their operations, with one creditor seeking to recover money via a winding up petition at London’s high court on Wednesday.The Liberty subsidiary that runs the site at Rotherham, called Speciality Steel UK (SSUK), was granted until 16 July to hold talks with unnamed potential investors, in a desperate effort to avoid a liquidation that would put 1,450 jobs at risk.The Labour government would face pressure to step in if the Rotherham plant, seen as an important part of British steel-making capabilities, faced bankruptcy.SSUK supplies aerospace and defence companies including Rolls-Royce and Airbus, and operates an electric arc furnace at Rotherham, a related works nearby at Stocksbridge, and two other sites. That business owes creditors £619m, including £289m to related GFG companies and £289m to Greensill’s administrators. Greensill’s administrators, Grant Thornton, earlier this month opposed a restructuring plan that would have cut the amount owed to it significantly, leaving Liberty scrambling to find other emergency funding.Daniel Judd, a barrister representing the company, told the court that SSUK was “urgently considering its options” after the failure of the restructuring plan, including talks to try to secure an unnamed “third-party investor”.“Urgent meetings have been taking place to advance this,” he told the court.The group confirmed it was considering a sale of its SSUK business in South Yorkshire, saying that “change is essential”.Jeffrey Kabel, Liberty’s chief transformation officer, said: “Today’s adjournment is a positive development, allowing us the necessary time to finalise options, including a sale of the business while we continue to pursue our debt restructuring efforts.“We remain committed to finding the right solution that preserves electric arc furnace steel-making in the UK, a vital national asset serving strategic supply chains.”Kabel said Greensill’s collapse was “restricting its access to capital”, alongside “longstanding competitiveness challenges dating back decades” for British steelmakers.Alun Davies, national secretary for steel at Community, a union representing workers, said the extra time “essentially amounts to the company kicking the can down the road” and “will achieve very little” other than uncertainty and distress for the workforce.“Things cannot go on as they are,” he said. “Sanjeev Gupta must demonstrate now that he is willing to invest in the business in a meaningful way, or he should step aside and make way for a new, responsible owner.”The UK’sSerious Fraud Office has been investigatingGFG Alliance and Greensill over “suspected fraud, fraudulent trading and money laundering” since 2021. Government figures have long been wary of offering financial support to Gupta’s companies in light of the investigation and concerns over whether money would be used to prop up businesses in other countries.Before July, Rotherham was running month-on, month-off for as long as five years, relying mainly on customers that could make pre-payments to buy materials needed. Rotherham runs the UK’s largest electric arc furnace, melting scrap steel to make specialised automotive and aerospace parts.The Scottish site is run by another subsidiary, Liberty Steel Dalzell. Workers at the plant are concerned that the failure to restart production could result in the Royal Navy considering other options for steel for new warships. The fleet solid support ships are due to be made with steel from British Steel in Scunthorpe, which would be rolled into plate at Dalzell, and thenfabricated at Harland & Wolff in Belfast.It is understood that the company is confident the Dalzell plant will be able to restart work soon.Explore more on these topicsSteel industryManufacturing sectorSanjeev GuptaGreensillAccountancyCorporate governancenewsShareReuse this content"

But despite this legacy, a cache of his most important papers was nearly shredded – only to be saved at the last minute when their significance was recognised at a family event.At auction next month, the papers are expected to sell for as much as £150,000 in 13 separate lots.Among the collection is the wartime codebreaker’s personal signed copy of his 1938 PhD dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals, valued at between £40,000 to £60,000.Also featured is his paper On Computable Numbers, also known as Turing’s proof, which introduced the world to the idea of a universal computing machine in 1936. It has been described as the first programming manual of the computer age and also has a guide price of £40,000 to £60,000.View image in fullscreenThe Delilah papers, A collection of rare project writings by Second World War codebreaker Alan Turing,Photograph: King’s College Cambridge/PAThe papers, known as offprints, were produced in very small numbers and distributed among fellow scholars, making these incredibly scarce survivors of a kind that rarely appear on the market.Jim Spencer, the director of Rare Book Auctions of Lichfield, Staffordshire, was asked to assess the papers, which were handed to him in a carrier bag, and he is overseeing their sale.“Nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to find in that carrier bag. I opened it and thought ‘good lord’,” he said. “Intensively researching and cataloguing these papers has left me feeling that Alan Turing was superhuman. For me, it’s like studying the language of another planet, something composed by an ultra-intelligent civilisation.”Turing played a vital role incracking the German Enigma codewhen he worked at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, which was crucial to the allied victory in the second world war. His theories have been credited with informing and shaping modern artificial intelligence. Spencer said he expected interest would be strong in Silicon Valley, where Turing’s influence continues.View image in fullscreenThe Delilah papers.Photograph: King’s College Cambridge/PATuring was later persecuted for being gay and took his own life in 1954 aged 41.The discovery of the papers was the result of a series of serendipitous events. After Turing’s death, his mother, Ethel, gave his papers to his friend and fellow mathematician Norman Routledge, who stored them in the loft of his home in Bermondsey, south London.Routledge died in 2013 and his sister recovered the documents during a clearout. She stored them in her attic where they remained until she moved into a care home. Her daughters then came across the papers but did not realise their significance and planned to put them through a shredder along with other documents.But last November they took them to a family reunion event and one relative suggested they seek an expert opinion. This was where Spencer came in.“These seemingly plain papers – perfectly preserved in the muted colours of their unadorned, academic wrappers – represent the foundations of computer science and modern digital computing,” he said.The papers include The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, from 1952. This is described as Turing’s lesser-known masterpiece of mathematical biology, and his last major published work. It has since become a basic model in theoretical biology.Charged as a criminal, barred from GCHQ, banned from the US and forced to undergo chemical castration, Turing killed himself two years after his conviction. “This injustice, and the fact he didn’t survive to see his enormous influence and impact, makes these papers feel so special,” Spencer said.The sale takes place on 17 June.Explore more on these topicsAlan TuringComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Police sources told El País he had two daughters at the school.Portnov was found dead when medics arrived. He had been shot at least three times, Madrid’s emergency services told reporters.Police cordoned off a car park near the private school, while helicopters and drones circled above, searching for the suspected killers. Police said they believed the shooting had involved two or three assailants and, according to the newspaper El Mundo, were investigating whether the shooting was a settling of scores related to organised crime or a political act.Alvaro Fernandez Garcia, a 22-year-old student who lives nearby, told AFP the shooting was shocking. “We usually see this on the news, or in other countries.”Widely seen as a pro-Russia political figure, Portnov, 52, was a Ukrainian lawmaker in the 2000s and became deputy head of the presidential administration under Yanukovych, an ally of Vladimir Putin.Portnov had been involved in drafting legislation targeting participants of the2014 revolution in Ukrainebefore Yanukovych was ousted by a popular uprising.Portnov fled Ukraine shortly afterwards. In 2015, he was reportedly living in Russia and later relocated to Austria. In recent years, he had been the subject of multiple investigations.In 2018, Ukraine’s security service SBU opened an investigation against him on suspicion of state treason, alleging Portnov had been involved in Russia’s illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula. The criminal case was closed in 2019.In 2021, the US Treasury department imposed sanctions upon him,alleging that“Portnov took steps to control the Ukrainian judiciary, influence associated legislation, sought to place loyal officials in senior judiciary positions, and purchase court decisions”.Portnov, who was also the subject of EU sanctions that were later dropped, appeared to have been living in Madrid since at least April 2024, according to a report by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine,Spainhas been the scene of several high-profile crimes involving Russians and Ukrainians. The southern European country is home to significant populations from both countries.In 2022, six letter bombs were sent to targets across the country, including Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, the Ukrainian and US embassies, and government offices. A retired Spanish civil servant, whose social media posts suggested that he opposed western support for Ukraine after Russia’s invasion, waslater found guiltyof terrorism and manufacturing explosives.In February 2024, a Russian helicopter pilot who haddefected to Ukraineone year earlier in a secret operation wasfound deadfrom gunshot wounds in a parking garage near the coastal city of Alicante.Wednesday’s shooting marked the second high-profile political shooting in Madrid in as many years; in 2023, the Spanish rightwing politician and former vice-president of the European parliament, Alejo Vidal-Quadras, survived afterbeing shot in the faceby a masked gunman in a wealthy Madrid neighbourhood.Police later arrested five peoplein connection with the shooting, though the suspected gunman – a French national of Tunisian origin with several previous convictions in France – remains at large.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But this time, the animals aren’t fleeing a flood, but rather insecurity, fear and anxiety,” Zazueta said.Since September, Culiacán has been the epicenter ofa bloody war between factions of the Sinaloa drug cartelthat has left more than 1,200 people dead and 1,400 missing, according to official figures.The cartel is one of six Mexican drug-trafficking groupsdesignated terrorist organizationsby the United States.Regular roadblocks and armed clashes in the region made it difficult for the sanctuary’s workers to keep the captive wildlife fed, another reason to relocate them.“The animals’ health began to suffer,” Zazueta said, adding that at least a ton of beef and chicken was needed every three days to feed the animals.Workers sedated the most dangerous of them, including lions and tigers, so they could be placed in cages for the 220km (nearly 140-mile) road trip.Two large containers and a huge crane were needed to load the elephants on to trailers.Monkey shot dead as Mexican cartels’ passion for exotic pets leaves bloody tollRead moreThe final destination is a site called Bioparque El Encanto, located in the seaside resort town of Mazatlán on Sinaloa’s Pacific coast and owned by a local businessman, Zazueta said.Big cats and other exotic animals have long been found at Mexican ranches and other properties owned by drug traffickers.Since September, federal authorities have discovered at least 14 big cats, some seized in raids and others found in abandoned houses believed to be used for criminal activities.They were given a new home at the Ostok refuge, whose director said the mass animal transfer sent a “painful message” about the situation in the Sinaloa state capital.“If animals can no longer live in Culiacán, who can?” Zazueta said.Explore more on these topicsMexicoWildlifeDrugs tradeAnimalsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He wasarrested in Septemberand has pleaded not guilty.On Wednesday morning, Gerard Gannon, an agent with Homeland Security Investigations who oversaw the March 2024 search of Combs’s Miami Beach home, took the stand forthe second timethis week.Gannon told the court on Tuesday that agents discovered AR-15 rifle parts, high heels, sex toys, lubricants, baby oil and lingerie in the closet of the main bedroom of Combs’s Miami home.On Wednesday, Gannon recalled that agents found a Gucci bag containing an assortment of pills including MDMA tablets, as well as white residue that tested positive for cocaine and ketamine, and other items in a different closet in Combs’s home.Photos shown in court were of items that agents said were found in a hallway closet, including more than 20 bottles of baby oil and lubricant.Gannon testified that agents found a loaded .45 caliber handgun in a suitcase in the guesthouse on the property.Under cross-examination, Gannon said the AR-15-style guns found in Combs’s home were disassembled and thus inoperable.The prosecution then called Dr Dawn Hughes, a forensic and clinical psychologist who specializes in trauma. Hughespreviously testified during the 2022 defamation caseof actors Amber Heard and Johnny Depp.Hughes testified that it was common for victims to remain in abusive relationships because they often feel trapped and that it can take months, or even years, before a victim is able to disclose the abuse to anybody. Trauma victims, she said, typically experience deep feelings of shame, humiliation and degradation.“They don’t want to talk about it,” Hughes said. “They don’t even want to think about it in their own brain.”In abusive relationships, Hughes said there is “almost always love” which creates “an intense psychological bond that creates an attachment with their abuser”.It often takes multiple attempts for victims to leave abusive relationships, Hughes said, before describing a cycle of “returning, and reconciliation, and then returning again” as a common pattern in abusive relationships.In tandem with physical violence, Hughes said abusers frequently use financial control to maintain power and make victims feel trapped. Victims often use drugs and repress memories, she said.Hughes told the court that she was paid $600 an hour for her work as an expert witness and $6,000 for a day of testimony in court.During cross-examination, Combs’s lawyers tried to paint Hughes as a biased expert witness who is being paid by the prosecution.On the stand, Hughes confirmed that she’s never testified in defense of someone accused of a sex crime, explaining to the court that she doesn’t “evaluate offenders”.After Hughes, the government called George Kaplan, a former assistant to Combs, to the witness stand.Kaplan said that he started working for Combs Enterprises in 2013 and that he was promoted in less than a year to Combs’s executive assistant.Kaplan testified that Combs would frequently threaten to fire him, and would say that he only wanted the best employees.Kaplan said that he communicated with Combs daily, and often prepared hotel rooms for him, stocking them with clothes, candles, lubricant, baby oil and more, and would clean them afterward.Kaplan told the court that “protecting” Combs’s public image was “very important”.Court adjourned at about 3pm ET. Kaplan will continue testifying on Thursday morning.On Tuesday, the jury heard froma former assistant to Combs, a male escort and Cassie Ventura’s mother, Regina Ventura, who accused him of blackmail and of assaulting her daughter.On Monday, the jury heard fromsinger Dawn Richardand Kerry Morgan, a former close friend of Ventura’s during her relationship with Combs. Both womentestified that they had witnessedCombs assaulting Ventura.Cassie Ventura spent four days on the stand last week, and testified aboutyears of physical and emotional abuseshe endured from Combs during their 11-year on-again, off-again relationship.Ventura said Combs orchestrated drug-fueled sex performances with male sex workers that he called “freak-offs”, and that hecoerced and blackmailedher into participating.She also alleged that Combs raped her in 2018 after their breakup.Prosecutors have sought to portray Combs as controlling and abusive, and as someone who exerted power over nearly every aspect of Ventura’s life and decisions.Attorneys for Combs have tried to undermine Ventura’s credibility and sought to depict her as a willing and consenting participant in the so-called “freak-offs”.The trial is expected to last seven more weeks. If convicted, Combs could spend the rest of his life in prison.Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsNew YorkHip-hopRapnewsShareReuse this content"

He said the Muslim head covering worn by young girls “seriously undermines gender equality and the protection of children”.Attal toldLe Parisienhe also wanted to introduce a criminal offence of coercion for parents who make their daughters aged under 18 wear the veil.Attal’s proposals were criticised by some on the left. The Socialist party lawmaker Jérôme Guedj said Attal was “chasing the far right” and turning French secularism against Muslims.Macron’s office said the report on the Muslim Brotherhood in France would be published by the end of this week. The Élysée Palace said that because of the “seriousness” of its findings, the government had been tasked to make proposals swiftly.Agence France-Presse, which obtained a copy of the report, said it pointed to the spread of Islamism “from the bottom up”. This was an apparent reference to municipal politics, charities, schools and sports groups. The report said this constituted “a threat in the short to medium term”.It is not certain if restrictions on the Muslim headscarf will be among the proposals made as a result of the report. In the 2022 presidential race, when Macron was re-elected, the far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who came second, proposedbanningthe wearing of the Muslim headscarf by any woman in all public spaces in France.What has 20 years of banning headscarves done for France? | Rokhaya DialloRead moreUnder current French legislation, civil servants in state buildings, including schools and hospitals, cannot wear obvious religious symbols such as a Christian crucifix, Jewish kippah, Sikh turban or Muslim headscarf.France is a secular republic built on a clear separation of church and state, intended to foster equality for all private beliefs. The state remains neutral in terms of religion but must safeguard everyone’s freedom to practise their own faith.In 2004, France banned girls from wearing Islamic headscarves in state schools – along with banning all other religious symbols such as crosses or turbans – arguing schools must be free of all religion. There is also debate in government over proposing a new law to ban the Muslim headscarf in domestic sports competitions.The Élysée said it had been important to commission a report on the Muslim Brotherhood. “The movement is present inEuropeand its target is clearly Europe,” an Élysée official said, adding that it was necessary to “raise awareness within the European Union”.But the Élysée also said: “We are all perfectly aligned in saying that we must not lump all Muslims together.”The official said: “We are fighting against Islamism and its radical excesses.”The report comes at a time when national politics in France is focused on issues of national identity and Islam, with Le Pen’s far right increasing its share of the vote.Bruno Retailleau, the hardline rightwing interior minister, was recently chosen to head the traditional right party Les Républicains, after its former leader Éric Ciotti left to join an alliance with Le Pen.Retailleau told the media before Wednesday’s meeting that political Islamism was “quietly infiltrating sporting, cultural, social and others associations” and its ultimate aim was to “tip the whole of French society into sharia [law]”.The French Muslim council issued a statement warning against targeting all Muslims. It said the state “must above all not feed a generalised suspicion towards Muslims in France”.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropeIslamGabriel AttalReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

The film cycles through a range of moods and ideas, and finally delivers a fair bit of that sentimentality from the title; it’s a movie of daddy issues and cinematic adventures in the manner of Fellini and Bergman, with a gag about overhearing a therapist’s session through the heating pipes, pinched from Woody Allen’s Another Woman.Stellan Skarsgård plays preening auteur Gustav Borg, whose career is on the slide; many years ago, he left his wife, Sissel, a psychotherapist, and two grownup daughters, abandoning the family home – the house where Gustav himself was brought up. Now their mother has died and Gustav’s daughter Nora (Reinsve), a famous stage actor starring in a production of A Doll’s House, is suffering anxiety attacks – and to snap out of it, she asks to be slapped backstage by the (married) actor with whom she is having an affair, played by longtime Trier player Anders Danielsen Lie.The Six Billion Dollar Man review – WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange’s rise, fall and limboRead moreNora’s sister, Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas), is a little calmer and more grounded, being happily settled with husband and young son, though a little messed up by the memory of having once had a small child-actor role in one of Gustav’s films – and feeling abandoned once the filming was over. Just as the two women are sorting through the house’s contents for things of sentimental value they might want to keep before selling the house, they are stunned to realise that the insufferable Gustav actually still has legal rights to the property and now wants to use it as a location for a biopic about his mother, who took her own life there due to the trauma of being tortured by the Nazis during the war.To add insult to injury, Gustav begs Nora to take the lead role of her own grandmother, expecting that Nora, whom he neglected for most of her life, will use her stage fame to revive his flagging career. He even asks Agnes to let him use her young son as a child actor, just as she once was used. But after Nora angrily refuses, the part is taken by Hollywood superstar Rachel Kemp (Elle Fanning), who has fallen for Gustav’s rascally charm at a film festival and brings with her huge amounts of investment funding. So Nora gets to be jealous and upset all over again.The stage appears to be set for an uproarious but bittersweet black comedy of the movie world and show business and the emotional vampirism and ruthlessness it involves, with a touch of All About Eve perhaps – made worse when you are working with members of your own family. And to some extent, that is what we get. But this long and slightly indulgent film also ranges across moods of rather serious wintriness and cinephile sadness about the changing industry. Gustav had insisted on using a veteran cinematographer with whom he’d worked many times, but realises he’s going to have to rescind the offer when he sees how decrepit the poor guy now is.There are also cinephile in-jokes (which are also Cannesphile in-jokes). When Agnes’s son has his 10th birthday, Gustav brings the poor boy an outrageously unsuitable present: some brand-new DVDs of horribly shocking films like Michael Haneke’s The Piano Teacher and Gaspar Noé’s Irreversible – but Trier shows the ultimate irony is that they don’t have a DVD player. Technological changes have robbed these films of the power to shock.We are of course heading for an emollient ending in which Gustav’s very real talent is to be acknowledged along with his muddled, flawed, old-guy affection for his daughters – and maybe Trier himself is now not above a bit of fictional ancestor-worship appropriate to his own high status. It’s a baggy comedy, sentimental in ways that are not entirely intentional, but there is value, too.Sentimental Value screened at the Cannes film festivalExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsStellan SkarsgårdElle FanningCannes film festivalNorwayEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

The documentarian prizes honesty above all else, even and especially when it’s unflattering to the parties on camera, while those with the ability to shut down the whole operation by rescinding their permissions might wield it in order to promote an agreeable image of themselves. If the talent calls the shots, you get point-and-shoot exercises in hagiographic brand management, and if the director lacks that diplomatic touch, the film doesn’t get made.‘Don’t be afraid of what you don’t know’: the inimitable genius of Andy KaufmanRead moreVery shortly after the film-maker Matt Wolf began work on Pee-wee As Himself, a three-and-a-half-hour portrait of the artist Paul Reubens airing on Friday night onHBO, he started to wonder if he had met his match in the “dream subject” he had pursued for years. Reubens finally agreed to participate in the project because his desire to set his own record straight dovetailed with Wolf’s cardinal rules of “nuance, complexity and integrity”, but the two nonetheless jockeyed for authorial control over a multiyear process. As their interview sessions stretched on and on to a total of 40 hours, the comedian famed for decentering himself behind his stage-and-screen persona Pee-wee Herman proved a formidable sparring partner in turns playful and distractible, sly and evasive, “taunting and rebelling and procrastinating and blowing off steam”, as Wolf remembers him.“I found him immediately to be incredibly intense and challenging, but also compelling,” Wolf tells the Guardian over Zoom from his home office, the original Pee-wee poster from the early days at the Groundlings (a parting gift from Reubens’s assistant) hanging on the wall behind him. “After our first talk, he said what you see at the beginning of the film: ‘I want to make this documentary myself, everyone’s advising me against it, and I don’t understand why.’ And I told him I wanted to get to know him, and see if he could find a way of working with me. It was thrilling and combative in equal measure.” Wolf came in with the rule of thumb that interview subjects tend to lose steam after five hours, so it’s best to call time around there; Reubens flatly rejected this, and insisted that Wolf would be the one to cry uncle first.The finished product is intimately conversational, not only an excellent representation of the experience of speaking with Reubens, but a cooperative effort to reconcile two approaches and perspectives occasionally at odds. In their time together, Reubens often placed his hand on the wheel, asking for scripts and shot lists for sequences meant to be spontaneous. Wolf did commit to include him in the edit and agree to show him a cut, but “the idea that I, as a documentary film-maker, could come in and take his life as the raw material for my work was alienating and confusing for Paul”, Wolf says. “Which I understand; he lost control of his personal narrative, and he had real trauma left over from that. I was sensitive of that, and at the same time, fiercely protective about my editorial independence.”While shooting, Wolf found his way forward by embracing this push and pull as part of the text, the first time he’d considered incorporating himself into his filmography. This posed a unique challenge when, with an interview scheduled for the following week in summer 2023, Reubens died of the lung cancer he’d kept a secret for the previous six years. “The day Paul died, that night, I started to read the 1,500-page transcript of our interview,” Wolf says. “I spent days doing nothing but reading, seeing all these new connections and significances.”Wolf suddenly found himself the primary custodian of another man’s life story, his newfound lack of disputes attached to a moral obligation to do right by Reubens’s legacy. “I could not drop this ball,” Wolf says. “Every day when I woke up, I was aware that I had to rise to the occasion for this extraordinary responsibility I’d been given.” Reubens died at what seemed like a turning point for the film, just as he and Wolf had broken through a long impasse and reached a resolution to move forward, their final dialogue marked by “assurances I needed to continue on”, as Wolf puts it. “I’m hyper-vigilant about not speaking for Paul, or speculating about things he didn’t tell me. It’s unfair to do that for someone who can’t speak for themselves. There are limits to what we can know about other people.”View image in fullscreenPaul Reubens.Photograph: HBOThe initial version of Pee-wee As Himself duly rehashed the main talking points of Reubens’s life and career: the formative boyhood obsessions that would become kitsch classics to the first generation of Americans reared on irony, the creation of the excitable man-boy Pee-wee Herman, the character’s anarchic stage show that begat widely beloved star vehicles on screens big and small, the reputation-tarnishing arrest for public indecency in an adult movie theater and a trumped-up charge of possession of child sexual abuse images fueled by culture-war grievance. Wolf was thorough, but guarded; “that first-cut was very self-censoring,” he recalls. “Everyone told me to get real.”Wolf’s revisions delved deeper by pulling back the curtain, using the interview as a device to illustrate the slippery, elusive nature of a deeply compartmentalized man. Reubens’s tendency to appear in public as Pee-wee was just one part of a complex pathology oriented around privacy, a veil of secrecy Reubens lifted in the knowledge that his days were numbered. Though widely suspected since he first came to prominence, Reubens confirms his homosexuality for the first time on camera, divulging that he actually went back into the closet after a public relationship with a handsome artist named Guy, who later died of Aids. The revelation that Guy originated what would become Pee-wee’s signature “mmm, [noun]-y!” reaction to food ranks as one of the most devastating details in a film that will emotionally pulverize devotees of Reubens.Though Pee-wee was friend to all – especially icons of queer camp, the guest list on his Christmas special bringing together Cher, kd lang and Zsa Zsa Gabor – Reubens uncomfortably shrugged off any notions of gay sainthood. His return to the closet was in part practically motivated, driven by the shrewd awareness (later proven brutally correct) that America would not accept a homosexual entertaining their precious, impressionable children. But acceptance was always the secret word of the day in the Playhouse, a little lunatic utopia in which kids’ weirdest passions – old-timey pop-culture detritus, janky claymation, humor verging on dada a decade-plus before junior audiences met Spongebob – were nourished and celebrated.View image in fullscreenPaul Reubens in Pee-wee’s Big Adventure.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarIf this tragically unfinished film can be said to draw a conclusion, it’s that the heart of Reubens’s legacy will live there, in the eccentricity and generosity of spirit that made him a hero to so many young oddballs and misfits. Wolf shares the story of a Pee-wee superfan in hospice, who reached out with a plea to see the film before losing her own battle with cancer. (She died two days before our interview, and he’d prefer to keep their “beautiful correspondence” to himself.) At first, Wolf didn’t know too much about Reubens the man beyond a vague awareness of his experimental early days, but he looks back on Pee-wee’s Playhouse as a “significant touchstone” in his youth. “I wouldn’t have been able to put words to it at the time, but I think it was my first encounter with art that I had a visceral reaction to,” he says. “And looking back, I think its message of radical acceptance, nonconformity and creativity, that became part of my DNA, as it did for so many kids and adults.”I know what he means. Though I’d missed the boat on the Playhouse’s initial broadcast run, I grew up as one of the Saturday morning faithful in reruns, enraptured by a show vibrating on a different frequency than everything else. For Wolf, a gay man, some of the resonance came from Reubens’s willingness to meet his audience at eye level with furtively mature humor speaking to queer sensibilities without explicit statement. But his appeal was also more expansive than that, an offbeat light in the darkness of the shrill, dull wasteland that was children’s programming. Before youngsters can put a name to camp, they know how to heed its call, every bit as spellbound by Pee-wee as Reubens was by Howdy Doody back in his day. That inspiration is the most meaningful gift he leaves behind. “The fact that we couldn’t articulate why we felt an affinity for something speaks to how profound its impact was,” Wolf says. “It eludes words, to understand why something changes you as a kid.”Pee-wee As Himself premieres on HBO in the US on 23 May with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsDocumentaryUS televisionTV comedyComedyTelevisionHBOFactual TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Zlotowski is perhaps channelling Hitchcock or De Palma, or even late-period Woody Allen – or maybe Zlotowski has, like so many of us, fallen under the comedy spell of Only Murders in the Building on TV and fancied the idea of bringing its vibe to Paris and transforming the mood – slightly – into something more serious.Foster is classy shrink Lilian Steiner, stunned at the news that her client Paula Cohen-Solal (Virginie Efira) has taken her own life. She is also furiously confronted by Paula’s grieving widower Simon (Mathieu Amalric), who believes she bears some responsibility for her death, having prescribed antidepressants which were apparently taken in overdose. But a tense visit from Paula’s daughter Valérie (Luàna Bajrami) leads her to suspect foul play. Soon, she and her tolerant ex-husband Gabriel (Daniel Auteuil) are putting people under surveillance and generally staking them out; then someone breaks into Lilian’s private office and steals the minidiscs on which she records analysis sessions.Things get even weirder: Lilian, stressed out and drinking, pays a visit to a cheesy hypnotherapist (Sophie Guillemin) who regresses her into some kind of past-life dream state in which she and Paula were lovers, playing in the string section of a Paris orchestra during the Nazi occupation and one of the Hitler militia is her estranged son Julien (Vincent Lacoste). Huh? Lilian’s own analyst, incidentally, is played in cameo by iconic documentary-makerFrederick Wiseman, and he angers her by raising the painful question of Lilian’s mother – a plot point that is not pursued and may have been lost in the edit.But what is the point of these bizarre Nazi orchestra scenes with Simon conducting, his baton transformed into a revolver? They are striking and amusing (and maybe show the influence of 40s movies such as Nightmare Alley or The Seventh Veil). Do they reveal Lilian’s concern with antisemitism? She certainly objects to a bigoted wisecrack from the hypnotherapist about Freud. Her ex-husband is an ophthalmologist who has treated her for problems with tear-ducts; again, it could signify something about Lilian’s problems with compassion, or perhaps it’s just the pretext for a bit of high-spirited comedy, a style that Foster carries off rather well, despite being hardly a natural.Vie Privée canters along to a faintly silly, slightly anticlimactic conclusion and audiences might have been expecting a bigger and more sensational twist. Yet Foster’s natural charisma sells it.Vie Privée (Private Life) screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersDrama filmsCrime filmsCannes film festivalJodie FosterFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Fitzcarraldo was Herzog’s own bizarre and brilliant story idea, crazily amplifying and exaggerating a case from real life.Early 20th-century opera enthusiast Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald, played with straw-hair and mad blue eyes by Klaus Kinski, goes into the rubber trade to make enough money to realise his dream of building an opera house in the Peruvian port town of Iquito; he works out that the steamship needed to transport materials can only be brought into the required stretch of water by dragging it across land between two tributaries. This is a crazy, magnificent and operatic obsession, more grandiose than anything that could be presented on stage, for which he will need Indigenous peoples as slave labour to haul the ship. By playing these tribes his Caruso records on an old gramophone player, he persuades them he is a white god who must be obeyed.In the original case, an entrepreneur (called Carlos Fermin Fitzcarrald) reportedly transported a 300-ton ship across land by disassembling it into a couple of dozen pieces; Herzog insisted on shifting the ship whole, and moreover insisted on filming these scenes in the remote interior, not near Iquito itself – which would have been far easier and probably would have looked the same. In the jungle, the cast and crew suffered the agonies of early settlers and colonial adventurers: illness, discomfort, poison-arrow attacks and, above all, mind-bending boredom as the weather meant that nothing could be done for months at a time. Perhaps no other period movie in history has so closely duplicated the subject matter in its gruelling shoot.Herzog’s original lead casting, Jason Robards, dropped out with amoebic dysentery and Mick Jagger, who was to play the innocent sidekick, evidently saw what an ordeal he was in for and dropped out as well, citing the need to record the album Tattoo You. Herzog surrendered to the inevitable and cast his old frenemy-slash-muse Kinski; but the mercurial hothead-genius was naturally hurt at not being first choice and made everyone’s life hell with arguments and complaints. And it is difficult to get your head around the thought of what it must have been like for the cast and crew just waiting, waiting, waiting for Herzog to decree that, yes, we can shoot.‘A goalkeeper vomited over my typewriter’: Werner Herzog on writing his wildest filmRead moreThis is a strangely subdued documentary, recorded as it was more or less contemporaneously with the film itself but which doesn’t fully show the nightmarish things which were soon to become legendary. (Fax Bahr and George Hickenlooper’s 1991 film Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker’s Apocalypse, about the horror of making Coppola’s Apocalypse Now in the late 70s, had the advantage of time and gave us far more juicy and scary material.) Herzog himself is shown talking mournfully about his disasters: the light-plane crashes that are supposed to have critically injured some people and paralysed another. (But these people are not named. What actually happened?)We do however see the darkness and intensity of Herzog himself as he descants on how much he loves but also hates the jungle in that unmistakable voice of his. “The birds don’t sing … they just screech in pain. Theirs is the harmony of overwhelming collective murder … I love it against my better judgment.” Amazingly, Herzog always looks in pretty good shape, considering what he’s gone through, and put others through. His burden of dreams is borne with some style. It’s a good curtain-raiser to the film itself.Burden of Dreams is in UK cinemas from 23 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsWerner HerzogPeruAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

Her last two albums, 2023’s Think Later and February’s So Close to What, have produced a litany of trap-pop smashes slathered in Y2K influences, all paired with videos that throw back to a bygone era ruled by the choreographed precision of peak Britney.On her first arena tour, McRae is keen to show how much work that’s taken. During a lengthy ballad section on a small B-stage she introduces three older songs, some written when she was 13, with the weariness of a veteran, while 2022’s piano-led Chaotic is about having a “midlife crisis at 17”. Work is even part of the show’s backdrop. Flanked by two giant yellow “Tate”-emblazoned cranes, and with part of the stage raised on steel girders, it feels as if McRae and her eight back-up dancers are breaking several regulations on a building site – you half expect a foreman to show up and question the suitability of McRae’s heeled boots.A natural performer, McRae is in her happy place when she locks into elaborate choreography, relishing the dance break that anchors sugary recent single 2 Hands, or utilising pop’s best prop, the chair, for the elastic, Pussycat Dolls-esque Sports Car. The climax of trap-adjacent kiss-off Exes, meanwhile, is McRae – resplendent in a leopard print leotard and matching flat cap – jumping into the splits, a move that elicits both cheers and gasps from the hopped-up, mainly female crowd.Add to playlist: underground pop star Neggy Gemmy and the week’s best new tracksRead moreThe sheer amount of massed dancing, however, means McRae isn’t always the show’s main focus. Her charisma is showcased better when things get looser, as on the sugary new wave strut of She’s All I Wanna Be, which has her skipping around the stage by herself. The atmospheric midtempo Siren Sounds is another solo highlight, McRae projecting its emotional and blown-out chorus to the rafters.Slick, professional and clearly a fan of overtime, McRae’s work rate is second to none. But while the results are impressive, she’s still learning to make it all look effortless.Explore more on these topicsTate McRaePop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Since then the much-garlanded New Zealander has contrived to be not only conspicuously prolific but also intriguingly unpredictable. Though she returned to wartime Germany in her Women’s prize-longlisted Holocaust novel,Remote Sympathy, her work has ranged from the coming-of-age psychological thrillerPettoThe Beat of the Pendulum, a “found” novel that drew on everything from conversations and social media posts to news bulletins and even satnav instructions to create a picture of one woman’s life over a year. The Axeman’s Carnival, published in the UK last year, was partly narrated by a magpie. Like The Wish Child it won the Acorn prize for fiction, making Chidgey the only writer to win New Zealand’s most prestigious prize twice.The Book of Guilt appears to mark another departure. Chidgey describes her ninth novel as her “first foray into dystopian fiction” and, while the book purports to be set in England in 1979 with a female prime minister newly ensconced in Downing Street, it is not the country we know. In Chidgey’s alternate universe, the second world war ended not in 1945 with allied victory, but in 1943 when the assassination of Hitler by German conspirators led to a swiftly negotiated peace treaty. Subsequent collaboration across Europe has ensured that progress in biological and medical science, already significantly advanced, has accelerated, fuelled by shared research that includes the grotesque experiments carried out on prisoners in Nazi death camps.The shadow of those atrocities lingers over 13-year-old identical triplets Vincent, William and Lawrence, the last three remaining occupants of a secluded New Forest children’s home, part of the government’s Sycamore Scheme. Supervised by three “Mothers”, each working an eight-hour daily shift, the boys do their lessons and their exercises and take their medicine, in constant battle with a sickness which, though its symptoms vary from boy to boy and month to month, is referred to only as the Bug. They long to get well so that they will finally be granted the wish of every Sycamore child before them and be sent to the Big House in Margate, an earthly seaside paradise with sun-soaked golden sands and unlimited access to the Dreamland amusement park. But though the boys pore over the dog-eared Margate brochure, “we never dreamt of trying to escape”, an older, wiser Vincent confesses as the novel opens. “Those were happy days, before I knew what I was.” Since then the Scheme has been abandoned, the Sycamore homes sold off. People do not like to talk about it, Vincent admits. Nobody wants to feel guilty.If all this sounds reminiscent of Kazuo Ishiguro’s most famous novelNever Let Me Go, that is because, in many ways, it absolutely is. The similarities go far beyond the late 1970s institutional setting. Like Kathy, Ruth and Tommy, Ishiguro’s trio of students at Hailsham, the Sycamore boys know they are different, special even, and yet their lives share Hailsham’s whiff of wartime make-do-and-mend, where the lessons are rudimentary and everything is secondhand. Like the Hailsham students, the triplets are sheltered not only from the truth of their circumstances but also from any meaningful contact with or grasp of the world that fears and exploits them. Like them, they will only gradually and painfully come to understand their real purpose. Vincent’s first-person narration addresses the reader directly, recalling Kathy’s conversational style.And yet, for all the inevitable comparisons, it becomes clear as Chidgey’s novel unfolds that it is by no means a clone of Ishiguro’s. While both novels take as their starting point the grave dangers posed by unfettered scientific advancement, Never Let Me Go is, at its heart, a meditation on mortality, an exploration of humankind’s profound resistance to the idea that we must all eventually be parted from those whom we love. Ishiguro does not seek to rationalise or explain the world in which the book is set. His interest is personal, not political.The Book of Guilt, by contrast, unfolds an alternate political reality, intercutting Vincent’s account with two other parallel narratives. Nancy is a girl held as a kind of prisoner by her adoring parents, while the harassed Minister of Loneliness is charged with winding up the Scheme. They combine to create a compulsively readable story that raises profound questions not only about the power of the state to dehumanise parts of our society but about our complicity in that power, the doublethink that permits us simultaneously to know a truth and not know it, to see and somehow contrive not to believe, dehumanising us in its turn.These questions run through all Chidgey’s work: they are the connective tissue that binds her seemingly contrasting projects and, in 2025, as the US turns its back on the world, they are more urgent than ever. The Book of Guilt is written with insight and brio, deftly balancing darkness and light, depth and pace. Set in its own distinctive time and space, it could have been extraordinary. Instead the ghost of Ishiguro stalks its pages, dragging behind it the inevitable clanking comparisons and fatally undermining the integrity of the world Chidgey has so painstakingly created.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Like one of those fairground punching bags, it pops right back up every time a crisis knocks it down. Friedrich Engels learned this the hard way. “The American crash is superb,” he enthused in a letter to Karl Marx in 1857: this was communism’s big chance. Well, not quite. The US Treasury stepped in, recapitalising banks with its gold reserves; in Britain the Bank Charter Act was suspended to enable the printing of money. The rulebook was torn up and capitalism saved.So it has always been. Every time we have teetered close to the precipice, big government has swooped down to save the day. The name of the game is “managed capitalism” and it has been a going concern for more than 200 years. This is the theme of John Cassidy’s new book, a marvellously lucid overview of capitalism’s critics, written in good old-fashioned expository prose – if at times a touch workmanlike compared with some of his subjects, such as exhilarating stylists Marx and Carlyle.Half of the book is given over toMitteleuropa (where we meet Karl Polanyi and Rosa Luxemburg, both of whom are having a bit of a moment these days), India (JC Kumarappa, Gandhi’s crony and pioneer of ecological economics), and Latin America (whose dependency theorists argued that the developed world was scooping up the benefits of rising productivity at the developing world’s expense). Cassidy steers clear of the theoretical thickets of György Lukács and Louis Althusser as well as of the more idiosyncratic anti-capitalist paths taken by Milovan Djilas and José Carlos Mariátegui. Still, it would be churlish to complain about omissions in a book that finds room for 50 potted biographies. This is by far the best primer I have read on the luminaries of the economic left.Early socialists, Cassidy shows, had little faith in government and equated the state with upper-class corruption. Many of them were sentimentalists or oddballs. The utilitarian socialist William Thompson, for one, thought it was possible to kill the “passion for individual accumulation” simply by substituting cooperation for competition; the humans he describes sound suspiciously like Sims characters. Carlyle’s anti-capitalism (“Mammon-worship is a melancholy creed”), meanwhile, led him to a pro-slavery position.We owe the left as we know it to Marx and Engels, who railed against financialisation and monopolisation – the “concentration of capital” – and defended planning and public ownership. The collapse of capitalism that they foresaw, however, never came to pass. From their vantage point of 1840, wages had flatlined even as profits had soared over the previous 50 years. This immiseration would surely bring about the system’s downfall. Yet the following century reversed the trend: wages rose faster than profits, and capitalism found new champions among the workers.Unlike the factory-owning Engels, Keynes was no class traitor: “The class war will find me on the side of the educated bourgeoisie.” His mid-century magic formula, low interest rates and tax-and-spend, led to astonishing growth and stability in the short run. Rachel Reeves could benefit from his counsel for countercyclical spending: “the engine which drives Enterprise is not Thrift but Profit”.But Keynes, as Paul Sweezy complained, treated the economy as if it were a machine that could be sent for repair. There were “political aspects of full employment” that Keynes had ignored, Sweezy’s Marxist comrade Michał Kalecki elaborated. Low unemployment meant enhanced labour power, so more strikes and higher wages and inflation. A capitalist backlash would ensue, he predicted.That is precisely what happened in the 70s. Milton Friedman made the case for a “natural rate of unemployment”, by which he meant that more unemployment was needed in order to destroy labour power and push down wages. This confirmed Marx’s observation that a “reserve army” of desperate jobless workers was the best weapon capital had to cripple unionism. Where Nixon could call himself a Keynesian, his successors Carter and then Reagan turned to neoliberalism.High interest rates and anti-union legislation followed. After a brief mid-century egalitarian blip in which economic growth exceeded the rate of return on capital, the opposite has once again become true in our own gilded age. This was Thomas Piketty’s insight, demonstrated with the sophistication of statistics, in his Capital in the Twenty-First Century.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There is not a single snide remark in these pages. He plays his cards close to his chest, but I suspect he might confess to being a Keynesian. A clue lies in his conclusion – “capitalism can be reformed” – which reminded me of Fredric Jameson’s witticism that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism.Capitalism and Its Critics by John Cassidy is published by Allen Lane (£35).

In the 1990s, this kind of technology would be out of date after just a couple of years. There would be some tantalising new machine out before you knew it, everybody competing to be on the cutting edge: the Game Boy and Sega Genesis/Mega Drive in 1989 were followed by the Game Gear in 1990 and the Super NES in 1991. Five years was a long life for a gaming machine.Now, it’s more like 10. TheNintendo Switch 2will be released in a couple of weeks, more than eight years since I first picked an original Switch up off its dock and marvelled at the instant transition to portable play. Games consoles often feel like they mark off particular eras in my life: the Nintendo 64 was the defining console of my childhood, the PlayStation 2 of my adolescence, and theXbox 360of the first years of my career, the first console launch I ever covered as a (ridiculously young) journalist. TheNintendo Switchcame along just a few months after my first child was born, and for me it has become the games machine of that era of harried early parenthood.When I reflect on my experiences with the Switch, I remember snatching moments inBreath of the Wild’s Hyrule while the baby napped beside me; hiding on the veranda of a French villa to play the odd Splatoon match on our first family holiday; and trying to make a mint on my Animal Crossing turnip trades while walking my second baby around the house in his sling, trying to get him to sleep (he never did). When they got old enough, the first games I playedwithmy children were on the Switch. We all played Pokémon Sword and Shield together, and most recently my youngest made his way through the surprisingly entertainingPrincess Peach Showtimewith only minimal assistance from me.View image in fullscreenHello to the moo … The Nintendo Switch created a unique gaming space all of its own.Photograph: Justin Lane/EPAOver the last eight years, my living room TV became dominated by things like Bluey and Moana and most recently (god help me), Alvin and the Chipmunks, and I no longer have the hours of uninterrupted gaming time in the evenings. The Switch gave me some of that that time back, though, letting me dip into games whenever I had a moment – which gave me vital stress relief, aroute back to myselfduring some of the most challenging years of my life. Eight years is a long time, enough for anyone’s life to change beyond recognition. In that time I’ve lost people, moved cities, gained new friends, too. And, of course, we all went through the pandemic.Animal Crossing: New Horizonsbecame perhaps the defining game of that time, and I am not the only person for whom the Switch was a blessed oasis, a way to connect when we were starved of in-person interaction.Things have changed for me since 2017, as they probably have for you. Consoles feel like companions, especially perhaps the portable ones like the Switch and the Game Boy, which we literally carry with us wherever we go. My kids are older now, enjoying all the Switch games that I enjoyed when they were very small – and it does seem as if the Switch 2 will neatly mark another new stage, for me and for them.I recently gathered together all the Switch consoles, games, controllers and accessories in my house and my office for an audit, from the battered day-one unit that serves as the family console to the untouched OLED Zelda special edition my partner got me and the variably functioning spare JoyCons accumulated over time. It’s not quite time for them to join the other old consoles under my bed, each in a clear plastic box with all of its cables, ready to be dusted off when the time comes; the Switch 2 will take its place in my rucksack and in my office, but I won’t be upgrading the family console for some time yet. I don’t really wantto. I think the Switch is probably my favourite console I’ve ever owned, not just because its best games are real hall-of-famers that will be remembered in another 20 years, and not just because its hybrid home-portable nature was a feat of technical wizardry that genuinely changed how I play – but also because of the space it has occupied in my life.A little sentimentality is forgivable at the end of an era. In a couple of weeks all the talk will be about the new console, how it’s selling, whether it’s worth the money, what the best Mario Kart World strategies are, and how it compares to its record-breaking predecessor. For now, I’m not thinking much about what theNintendo Switchmeant for the gaming industry; instead I’m thinking about what it meant to me.What to playBe who you wanna be … there are many lives to choose from in the latest RPG, Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time.Illustration: Level5/Have you ever heard ofFantasy Life? It was a bit of a cult hit on the Nintendo 3DS in 2014, a cosy-feeling role-playing game that let you switch between 12 different professions, so you would be blacksmithing one minute, fighting monsters another and cooking things up the next. The sequel –Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time –is out today after years of delays.You can now be an artist or a farmer as well as a magician, carpenter, fisherman, alchemist or whatever else you fancy, and also it adds time travel into the mix. It’s an intriguing amalgamation of the Animal Crossing/Harvest Moon style of Japanese life simulator, and the Dragon Quest/Ni no Kuni flavour of unthreatening role-playing game, and I’m looking forward to exploring it.

My opinion has somewhat changed now that the successor to the Nintendo Switch is called Switch 2. Do you have any thoughts on console names?”It’s true that Nintendo usually goes for completely new names for each console, except arguably the series ofGame Boys, theNESandSuper NES,WiiandWii U, and nowSwitchandSwitch 2. And yes, this is the first time they’ve gone for a number. I’d say this is down to how badly the company did with the Wii U, whose confusing name surely contributed to how badly it flopped. But I think it reflects the more conservative and cautious mood of the games industry as a whole in 2025, as it comes to the end of decades’ worth of unsustainably rapid growth. Or maybe it’s because Nintendo’s president Shuntaro Furukawa used to be an accountant.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterNintendo SwitchGames consolesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some of his early works from this period have been brought together at a small but perfectly formed exhibition, curated by Louis Kasmin, grandson of John Kasmin, the dealer who first spotted Hockney.View image in fullscreenThrums with angry static … Composition (Thrust), 1960, by David Hockney.Photograph: © Royal College of Art. Royal College of Art, LondonAfter leaving the Bradford School of Art, Hockney showed up at the RCA in 1959 ready to kick the art world’s doors in. But this is not the Hockney the world knows now. There is no simplicity, no calm. There are no cool, flat planes of bright colour. Rather, young Hockney was a frantic, angry, tempestuous thing.And he was clearly slightly over-enamoured of the ultra-hip abstract expressionists in New York. These paintings, prints and drawings are full of vicious scribbles, irate marks and tempestuously flung paint. It’s almost bewildering to see the guy known for the precise restraint of A Bigger Splash going all hyper-expressive and emotional.He was also almost unstoppably horny. A vast white phallus plunges into a huge splodge of brown in Erection; another pierces up into a plane of white in Shame. Men embrace chaotically in We Two Boys Clinging Together, while a figure thrums with angry static in Composition (Thrust), the word “queen” angrily scrawled down its back. These are works filled with the excitement of burgeoning and, at the time still illegal, sexuality. Hockney was learning to embrace being a gay man, and the art here is a pretty good indicator of what he spent most of his time doing.Whatever spare hours he had away from this pastime he clearly spent immersing himself in all the modern art wonders London had to offer. It was his first time living in the capital, his first chance to lose himself in what its galleries had to offer.Hockney’s modern aesthetic is so unique, so ubiquitous, so incrediblyhim, that it’s a shock to see such glaringly obvious influences in his work. Twombly-esque scrawls, Bacon-y smudged figures, Rauschenbergian mess, Jasper Johns-like lettering. It’s all a little derivative.Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Nothing here feels like a rip off or cheap copy. Rather, it feels like synthesis, as if Hockney was absorbing all the big hits of modern art of his time, mashing them together and spitting out something new.View image in fullscreenDavid Hockney with Cha Cha Cha, around 1960-61.Photograph: Bridgeman ImagesHockney found himself surrounded by competition, too, including the likes of Derek Boshier, Patrick Caulfield and Allen Jones who would soon help invent pop art. He had to raise his game.And his game was clearly not abstraction, which as this show progresses he largely ditches, and for the better. The prints of his take on A Rake’s Progress are stark, political and confrontational, and then the last two rooms get even more figurative; a giant bespectacled demon (likely Hockney himself) stomps between New York skyscrapers, a woman dances herself into a blur, two semi-nude, barely there figures haunt an empty room, sitting on a filthy mattress. It’s all assured and so confident, bursting with love and sex and partying. It might not be abstract, hard edged experimentation, but it’s still undoubtedly something new.The temptation is to view this show purely as the first steps of an artistic giant, to look for hints in all this dark energy and chaos as to what he’d eventually become. That’s fair enough, but it’s also great art on its own merit, a portrait of youth, excitement, joy, hormones and sheer creative will.In the Mood for Love: Hockney in London, 1960-1963is at Hazlitt Holland-Hibbert, London, until 18 JulyExplore more on these topicsDavid HockneyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Brought to life in a bestselling memoir written with Basque poet Amets Arzallus Antia, it follows his trek from Guinea, west Africa, as a teenager, across the Sahara and Mediterranean to Europe as he goes in desperate search of his runaway younger brother.A story about the horrors of migration, it has so many gut-punch moments alongside flashes of levity that it should make for dramatic viewing on stage. Balde undergoes hunger, human trafficking, torture and ransom as well as a terrifying ocean crossing. His voice is clear, distinctive and full of natural poetry. So why does this production, adapted byTimberlake Wertenbaker, who translated the book from its original Basque, feel so lifeless?Part of it might be down to ploddingly unimaginative staging. Blair Gyabaah, playing Balde, largely narrates the story and is a charming presence but there is so little construction of drama around him that it becomes a physically static audio-led experience.Directed by Stella Powell-Jones, the production is framed around the relationship between Balde and Arzallus Antia (Youness Bouzinab) but this does not add layers. Actors juggling roles come on briefly in an array of costumes (headdresses and guns for many Arabs, gold watch for cash-counting people smugglers). These are the characters Balde meets on his journey and the five-strong cast are adept but the parts are representational and unanimated, the focus on incident and sequential story rather than drama.Author denied UK visa unable to attend premiere of play based on his memoirRead moreBalde’s clear and sometimes bathetic voice is captured but his story seems educational when it should come saturated with depth of emotion. Where the original is compactly told, high in tension and jeopardy, this feels too long and flat, despite being performed over 90 minutes.An African drum beats every now and again, along with the swoosh of ocean waves or puttering of motorbikes, but it is not enough to bring atmosphere. A back screen lights up occasionally but is underused on the whole. The set, designed by Natalie Johnson, incorporates salmon-coloured steps – to represent the sun-hammered terrain which Balde hikes across? – but characters too often stand in a row, enacting bite-size scenes.Family members make appearances but they too are so thinly drawn that they do not build the emotional drama. When Balde discovers the fate of his brother it is not the emotionally eviscerating moment it should be.The idea to bring this remarkable migrant story to a new audience is nothing less than necessary in our current hostile climate. But something seems to have been lost in its translation to a new medium.AtJermyn Street theatre, London, until 21 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreJermyn Street TheatreTimberlake WertenbakerreviewsShareReuse this content"

There’s plenty to love about thisUS import, acountry musicalwith a zany corn obsession and a message about breaking down barriers that suits this open air theatre. But just how much corn-fed wordplay can you stomach? You’ll soon find out. There’s a maze of maize jokes, some kernels of truth amid the cornball sentiment, a husk of a plot about a corn doctor mistakenly assumed to treat ears not feet and a few painful gags about cornholes. The actors essentially double as standups, delivering one-liners that are often very funny and occasionally enhance character and story but are mostly fired at random as if punslingerTim Vinehad been cloned and let loose.We’re in Cob County where Maizy (I’m afraid so) is about to wed Beau. When the small town’s valuable corn crop fails, she journeys to Tampa, Florida, for answers and meets conman Gordy who has two dubious claims – one on her heart and one that he can save the beleaguered town. A handsome design includes costumes by Tilly Grimes (dungarees, neckerchiefs, denim), golden lighting by Japhy Weideman and a stage bookended by cornfield thickets and circled by glowing purple rocks. Scott Pask’s set features a huge barn, its rafters broken and exposed to the elements, the whole building slanting as if about to be uprooted by The Wizard of Oz’s tornado.But it’s Brandy Clark and Shane McAnally’s songs that often blow you away: hoedowns, lonesome ballads, stagecoach rhythms, loud and proud show tunes, with a five-piece band heavy on the guitars and giving a percussive boost to the humour. Sarah O’Gleby’s choreography slowly builds up steam, with performers eventually walking on whiskey barrels and mixing hand claps with foot slaps.View image in fullscreenSongs that often blow you away … Shucked.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianGeorgina Onuorah thoroughly takes possession of Independently Owned, an anthem of self-determination – no mean feat as it is so closely linked with Alex Newellwho won a Tony awardin the same role as whiskey-making Lulu. When Ben Joyce (Beau) sings a solo called OK you half want him to do a full country set himself while Sophie McShera makes a yearning case for a world of windows not walls in Maizy’s solo. Matthew Seadon-Young has fun with a jazzy number about Gordy’s bid to be badder. Under Katy Richardson’s musical direction, many shades and themes of country music are present yet the lyrics sometimes lack the genre’s reputation for storytelling.The show is moved along by two storytellers, a little like theMean Girls musical, with Monique Ashe-Palmer and Steven Webb sharing a nice rapport. With a book by Robert Horn, it’s presented as a fable, not as you may first think about climate catastrophe but about loving neighbours and welcoming strangers, respecting home yet not being afraid to roam.But when even the thinly drawn characters express alarm at the words they’re saying, it’s hard to invest in the relationships. Comedies tend to have one wise-cracking role like the goofy Peanut (Keith Ramsay), but here everyone shares the compulsion to deliver bon mots, lollipop stick jokes and small-town homespun humour. It’s ultimately exhausting and not only flattens character but reduces dialogue to the same pattern of setup, pause and punchline (many of which you see coming), slowing down Jack O’Brien’s rambling production.Would it help if you were familiar with Hee Haw, the country music variety TV show to which it pays homage? Perhaps. But across town,Mischief Theatreare unleashing their own barrage of groansome gags inThe Comedy About Spies, a dizzily ridiculous farce which ambushes audiences on many levels, including making you sympathetic towards the unlikeliest characters. Shucked really wants you to laugh and care but to do that would require separating the wheat from the chaff.AtRegent’s Park Open Air theatre, London, until 14 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Plus some incredible dancers.To the good stuff first: these dancers, the men especially, are so vividly alive in Canadian choreographer Crystal Pite’s Frontier, with quicksilver reflexes and fizzing energy, even though everything’s executed with total control. Soloists dressed in white dance Pite’s treacle moves as if you can see the gravity. But they are among shadows, hooded figures all in black, who at times lift and support the soloists as if they’re being carried by invisible forces. Elsewhere they loom ominously, they are ghosts or fears. The mood is eerie with the whispers and echoes of Owen Belton’s soundtrack.Pite has a way with readable visual ideas. What might amount to a line written down – black v white, individual v group – becomes expansive in movement, sensitively alive. (She has said the dark figures represent the unknowns of the universe and consciousness, but it works whether you know that or not.) She has a talent for composition and structure, and for considering the audience’s journey. The transcendent voices of composer Eric Whitacre open the piece and they return at its end in a choral catharsis, to make a satisfying whole.View image in fullscreenReadable visual ideas … Eduardo Jiménez Cabrera in Frontier by Crystal Pite.Photograph: Michael SlobodianThis mastery of composition is something that’s missing in Johan Inger’s piece Passing (and, to be fair, in a lot of choreography). The Swede is much less well known in the UK than Pite. ENB danced his Carmen last year, but this is a lighter piece, certainly at the outset. It feels human in scale, with guitar-picking music and folksy movement, playing out snippets of life’s landmarks and seasons, its circles, rituals and relationships, with light, colour and humour; the dance itself is pleasingly wry in tone.But somewhere around the halfway point, it becomes overstretched. A mournful a cappella song outstays its welcome, things get nebulous.

The sister trade associations have called for the government’s comprehensive spending review to dramatically increase public investment, including £500m for infrastructure, and to support itsTheatre for Every Childinitiative which aims to ensure all pupils attend a professional theatre production before leaving school.The organisations’ co-CEOs, Claire Walker and Hannah Essex, said: “Theatres are doing more with less – and the strain is showing. Rising costs, shrinking support and ageing infrastructure are putting the sector under unsustainable pressure. We are seeing world-class organisations forced to cut programmes, delay maintenance and scale back outreach. If we want to maintain the UK’s position as a global leader in theatre – and continue to inspire the next generation of actors, writers, and technicians – then government must act.”The report, drawing on information from theatres that are members of the two organisations, states that one in five venues “require at least £5m over the next decade simply to remain operational”. Without substantial capital funding, nearly 40% “could close or become unusable”. Roughly one in four organisations ran a deficit in 2023–24, and almost one-third project a shortfall in the subsequent financial year.Since 2010, funding from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has fallen by 18% per person in real terms, notes the report, while local authority support has declined by as much as 48%. “Years of decline in creative education and underinvestment in skills training have left theatres struggling to recruit and retain staff,” it adds, with almost half of theatre leaders saying that new hires lack the necessary skills, particularly in technical roles.Against this backdrop, and the challenges of the pandemic and cost of living crisis, the two organisations’ member theatres drew audiences in excess of 37 million in 2024. ItsWest Endvenues “surpassed 17.1 million attenders [akin to 2023 levels] and generated more than £1bn in revenue”. Data from 48 regional venues shows a 4% increase in occupancy between 2019 and 2024 yet also underlined what regular theatregoers around the UK will have noticed: the number of shows being programmed has, in many cases, dropped in the last five years as theatres prune their schedules amid financial challenges.Bemoaning news headlines about premium ticket prices, the report stated that across the UK most tickets were sold for £39.50 or less (with 19% priced under £20 outside London), while in the West End most were sold at £56 or less. Since 2019, the average West End ticket price has fallen by 5.3% in real terms.Research quoted by the report shows that for every £1 spent on a theatre ticket, “an additional £1.40 is spent in the local economy”, while every pound of public investment returns more than £11 to the Treasury. The report said that the West End’s 11% post-pandemic audience growth is unmatched in the UK’s entertainment sector and highlighted that, last year, “nearly one in four international visitors to London attended a West End show – a testament to its global appeal”.Explore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndArts fundingTicket pricesConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

Eugene Jarecki’s documentary takes its title from the price the incoming Ecuadorian government supposedly charged the Trump administration for helping furnish his extradition to the US, thereby reneging on a promise of political asylum. If The Six Billion Dollar Man doesn’t rebuild Assange, exactly, that’s because it’s more interested in comprehensively demolishing his enemies. Compared to the hypocrites, scoundrels and crooks who surround him, the man himself looks almost virtuous.Actually Assange is mostly a background presence here. He’s more talked about than talking up; a karmic victim of his own success. While even his supporters admit to his personal failings (arrogance, cruelty, bouts of megalomania), the film asks us to regard him as a messenger shot down by bigger, darker forces; a man whose only real crime was publishing inconvenient truths.The Swedish rape charge, it argues, was largely cooked up as a means of delivering him to the US authorities, so that they in turn could charge him with violating the Espionage Act. “Julian Assange is not an angel carved in marble,” says the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden (no angel himself). “But he’s not a vial of poison either.”Poison or not, Assange’s release of diplomatic and military secrets leaked into the water table and served to destabilise the US government. Jarecki’s film provides a crisp, thorough recap of WikiLeaks’ greatest hits, beginning withthe publishing of the “collateral murder video”that showed US forces slaughtering unarmed civilians in Iraq, and reveals the ways in which the internet’s unfettered heyday was able to service a new kind of activism. Previously, whistleblowers such as Daniel Ellsberg (who leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971) released classified information at enormous personal risk. Thanks to Assange’s website, they could now do so anonymously, and on an industrial scale.The film makes the case, though, that WikiLeaks was at its most fire-proofed when it stayed small and nimble and operated with a skeleton crew.Its explosive release of diplomatic cableswas a high-profile joint venture, published in association with the Guardian, the New York Times and Der Spiegel, and the ensuing fallout placed Assange in the crosshairs. “Politically we’re untouchable now,” he brags as he arrives for a meeting at the Guardian and it is possibly this kind of hubris that made him blind to the danger. In September 2011an indiscriminate dump of unredacted US embassy cablesput scores of innocent lives at risk and tarnished his credentials as a crusading campaigner.View image in fullscreenJulian Assange poses for photographers at the photo call for The Six Billion Dollar Man.Photograph: Lewis Joly/Invision/APIt is the dark irony of the WikiLeaks story that the site should itself be undone by a series of leaks and betrayals. Assange’s former colleagues blame David Leigh, the Guardian’s former investigations editor, for publishing a top-secret password in the WikiLeaks book he co-wrote with Luke Harding. But the real Judas of Jarecki’s film isSigurdur “Siggi” Thordarson, a creepy teenage hacker inexplicably beloved by Assange. It was Siggi, we learn, who embezzled $50,000 (£37,000) from the company’s online store and who later agreed to wear an FBI wiretap.Initially a safe house, the Ecuadorian embassy in central London is revealed to turn by degrees into a false sanctuary. The film claims that Assange was effectively sold out by the building’s private security staff, who bugged CCTV cameras and passed the footage to a band of small-time crooks. His friends worried that Assange’s life in limbo was making him increasingly paranoid.While Assange has already been the subject of numerous documentaries, plusThe Fifth Estate, a Hollywood drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch, The Six Billion Dollar Man feels close to definitive. It’s rigorous and forensic and covers the ground with aplomb. Jarecki’s army of eye-witnesses run the gamut from Naomi Klein to Pamela Anderson (a fan and frequent visitor) to the former president of Ecuador, while the film’s sprawling crime scene eventually straddles half the globe.For all that, its most indelible, disquieting images are provided by the CCTV footage of Assange marooned in the embassy. He knows he’s being bugged and understands that he’s trapped and he paces his quarters like a hapless Gene Hackman at the end of Francis Ford Copppola’s The Conversation. Whatever he set out to be it almost certainly wasn’t this: the anguished poster boy for a world in which every hacker gets hacked, every person is spied on and no secret is safe.The Six Billion Dollar Man screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsJulian AssangeWikiLeaksThe GuardianThe US embassy cablesNational newspapersreviewsShareReuse this content"

The contest was ultimatelywon by Austria’s JJ with Wasted Love.Finland’s Yle Entertainment said: “We will ask the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) whether it is time to update these rules or at least review whether the current rules allow for abuse.” Spain’s public broadcaster called for a “complete review” to avoid “external interference”.Ireland’s RTÉ has requested a breakdown of the numbers, and the Netherlands and Iceland are also among those to have raised issues. Director of the competition, Martin Green, said it is taking the concerns “seriously”.Yuval Raphael performs New Day Will Rise in Basel during Saturday’s Eurovision song contest.Israel’s song, New Day Will Rise, submitted by the Israeli public service broadcaster Kan,comprehensively wonthe public part of the vote, after scoring points from 34 of the 38 national and international phone votes. Its performer, Yuval Raphael, was a survivor of the terror assault on the Nova musical festival.The previous Israeli entry finished second in the public vote, earning fifth place in the 2024 contest. Kan had previously beenforced to change the lyricsof entry October Rain, which was deemed to directly reference the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack inside Israel. Performer Eden Golan instead sung the retitled Hurricane.Public Spotify and YouTube streaming data shows that Raphael’s track lags far behind other competitors in terms of popularity. New Day Will Rise wasthe 19th most popular songfrom this year’s competition on Spotify in the week of the event, yet scored the maximumdouze pointsfrom 13 national public votes.Israeli government social media channelshave been encouraging people to vote for its representative the maximum 20 times permitted. The Israeli embassy in London posted to social media during the final, encouraging people to vote 20 times for Raphael.View image in fullscreenEden Golan rehearsing in Malmö during last year’s contest.Photograph: Leonhard Föger/ReutersThe Israeli marketing appears to encourage people to submit multiple votes without even having listened to the song or watched the show. This is not currently against Eurovision’s rules.Belgium’s broadcaster VRT provided data to community news site Songfestival.be which alsoappeared to showa disparity between numbers of viewers and voters. Their statistics indicated that the number of votes cast from Belgium had increased from 1.3m in 2023, to 2m in 2024 and then 2.2m in 2025. However, the show had only about half as many viewers in 2025 as in 2023, as Belgium did not make the final.Dutch broadcaster AvroTros issued a statement this week saying that it attaches “great importance to the apolitical and binding value of the Eurovision song contest” but that it is “increasingly influenced by social and geopolitical pressures”.The results have delighted some quarters. The Jewish Chronicledescribed the 2025 resultas a “rebuff” to anti-Israeli activists and media pundits, writing that “Eurovision fans ignored the relentless campaigning against the Jewish state”.Ewan Spence, senior editor atESC Insight, which reports on Eurovision all year round, told the Guardian that there are potential issues with any future Israeli victory while the Gaza conflict continues. “If Kan wins the Eurovision song contest under the Israeli flag, it would be expected to host the following year, which would raise significant security challenges.“If the contest had to be hosted elsewhere in partnership, the reputation of Eurovision inside Israel would be damaged, and the co-host broadcaster taking on that challenge would face reputational PR issues.”German broadcaster ARD would most likely be the first port of call for the EBU approaching someone to co-host alongside Israel, the way the UK co-hosted on behalf of Ukraine in Liverpool in 2023. However, Benjamin Netanyahu’s administration, which has beenseeking to privatise Kan, would almost certainly apply pressure for the contest to take place in Israel itself. Broadcasters would be under pressure to boycott a contest hosted or co-hosted by Israel while the conflict in Gaza continued.View image in fullscreenPro-Palestinian demonstrators attend a protest, on the day of the Eurovision song contest final in Basel.Photograph: Christian Hartmann/ReutersSome in the Eurovision community believe the contest has been affected by changes made by the EBU to accommodate Israel’s participation. The volume of the crowd in the arena appears to be mixed lower now, to prevent TV broadcasting boos for Israeli acts or pro-Palestinian slogans, and stricter rules were brought in on fans having flags inside the arena. There wasa security incident during Raphael’s performancethat led to a Eurovision staff member being hit with paint, and on the day of the contest pro-Palestinian demonstrators clashed with police in the centre of host city Basel.Spence said: “If Kan had won Eurovision on Saturday, the song contest would have faced an increased loss of engagement from community media and the wider fanbase.”Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez explicitly called on Israel to be expelled from Eurovision on Monday, directly comparing the situation with that of Russia’s exclusion from international events, saying: “[Russia] had to leave international competitions and could not take part … Therefore Israel shouldn’t either, because what we cannot allow is double standards in culture.”The EBU has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionEuropeTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s how to open your mouth without putting your foot in itKerry DownesWed 21 May 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 21 May 2025 11.43 EDTShareIt is estimated thatone in seven couplesin the UK will experience difficulties conceiving, and many will go on to have fertility treatment. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) reports that more than1.3m IVF cycles have been performed in the UK since 1991. I was 32 when I first underwent treatment, and I didn’t know anyone else who had been through it. Six years on, a quick headcount of IVF-enduring friends almost reaches double figures; we can no longer consider it rare. If you have friends, family or colleagues in their 30s and 40s, it is highly likely that some will be having IVF (that is not to say that no one younger will be – it is just statistically less likely: the average age is now 36).It can be difficult to know what to say to someone who has shared that this is their path to potential parenthood – the outcome possibly exciting, possibly heartbreaking. From my experience of that challenging time, there are comments that can boost and others that, however well intentioned, can sting.Despite having been on the rollercoaster myself, I have still walked away from conversations with friends regretting my choice of words. I think openness is always the best option; if something slips out that your brain later berates you for, then be honest and share your regret. The self-reflection shows that you care how your words are being received, and that you are trying, which is all that can be asked. Otherwise, this would be my advice:What not to sayOh, you’re not drinking?The question may seem innocuous, but it is often accompanied by a raised eyebrow, a smug smile or, God forbid, a wink. Most people do not drink alcohol during fertility treatment and acting as if you have just guessed their pregnancy secret will only highlight how upsettingly untrue this is.Children are overrated anywayThe only person allowed to say this is your fabulous child-free-by-choice friend who drinks champagne in sequined outfits while browsing art galleries each weekend, and genuinely doesn’t understand all the fuss. Mothers of three who later that day post gushing photos of their children on Instagram should categorically not say this.Why don’t you just adopt?Adoption is an incredible thing to do, but it is a very different route to having a family, and a complex process to navigate. When my second cycle ofIVFfailed, I stayed up drinking red wine and scrolling Instagram for adoption stories through intermittent bouts of tears; they brought me much more comfort than the 1.1m IVF success hashtags. But this was in the private world of my phone; if a friend had suggested I “just adopt”, I would have taken it to mean they thought my pursuit of fertility treatment was foolish and futile. Most people going through IVF will have thoroughly considered all routes to parenthood and suggesting they adopt is unlikely to be enlightening. Rather, it comes across as unsupportive.Whohas the issue, then, you or him?I won’t gratify this with an explanation, but yes, people honestly ask this.How exciting!This is a difficult one. It is entirely reasonable to feel excited by the thought of your friend becoming pregnant but, for reasons of self-preservation, they will probably be approaching the process cautiously. On average,only 31% of embryo transfers are successful, so there is a careful balance to be had in terms of positive thinking and cautious restraint. I had people clapping with excitement and even congratulating me for starting the process, then telling me I shouldn’t think that way if I reminded them of the potential for failure. This sort of toxic positivity left me feeling distanced from the friends who didn’t seem to understand my hesitancy towards hope.Well, you never know! Any holidays coming up?Everyone has heard of a couple who had eight rounds of IVF then magically got knocked up on holiday because they “just relaxed!”This phrase has become so reviled by those trying to conceive thatthe Big Fat Negative Podcastnow sells T-shirts emblazoned with the words. There are myriad reasons why people cannot conceive, and suggesting that lying on a beach might assuage their neuroticism is unlikely to go down well.Did youfind the donor online? Like shopping! Is there a photo? What nationality are they?Some people going through IVF will use donors, and obviously all same-sex couples will. I asked two of my gay friends for their input when writing this article; I wanted to know if things had landed in the same way – perhaps approaching IVF without years of disappointment already stacked up meant that it really was exciting. But their views reflected my own, with an additional gripe of being asked inappropriately intimate questions about the donors. People are seemingly obsessed with the donor’s looks and nationality, asked outright which partner’s egg/sperm was being used, and frequently referred to the donors as the mother or father. These are extremely intrusive questions and not appropriate for casual pub conversations with a friend you see once a year.What to sayI’m sorryyou’re having to go through thisReserved for heterosexual couples where there is obviously a more fun route to the end goal, sometimes a simple acknowledgment that it is not an ideal situation is all that’s needed. Just ensure you don’t slide from empathetic into dramatic pity. I’ve seen that face and all it does is scream: “Oh wow, your life sucks!”I’m here for you if there’s anything you needIt might be offering fridge space to make room for their extensive stash of medication, driving them to a clinic appointment, or posting Hobnobs through the letterbox on a day when they are not up for company. Reminding friends that you are there and ready to show up goes further than you think.Idon’t really know much about itRead the room on this one: if someone is telling you through tears that they are starting IVF, then now is not the time for a science lesson – go and do some background reading instead. But I didn’t expect friends to know the ins and outs of the process and always appreciated their honesty in telling me so.I’ll get thisThere is no getting away from it: IVF is expensive. NHS funding varies considerably across the UK:the latest figuresshow that only 24% of cycles in England were NHS-funded, whereas 58% were in Scotland. A single cycle costs about £5,000, and most people will require multiple. People take on second jobs and remortgage their houses to fund treatment. It can be incredibly stressful, so don’t make them feel bad if they skip that absurdly priced hen do or suggest dinner at a place with buy one, get one free burgers. Paying the bill for their beetroot smoothie might feel like a drop in the ocean, but it is a kindness that will be noted.NothingMy best friend left a bottle of non-alcoholic wine on our kitchen table with a hand-drawn card of a pineapple, the words “still ’ere”carefully inked beneath. A colleague put a card in my tray after I asked my manager to let her know I was starting treatment. We never talked about it, but I read her kind words again and again. When I mentioned that the hormones were making me feel exceptionally blue, my schoolfriends, hundreds of miles away, banded together and sent flowers. Sometimes, caring from a distance can feel less confronting and more powerful.I know someone else going through it, if you ever wanted to talkMany people don’t know anyone else going through IVF, so if you can connect two willing people, then do. There is a whole sisterhood of big-hearted, needle-wielding warriors out there and, while comparisons can feel dangerous (how many eggs, what grade of embryos etc), with some care and boundary-setting, these obstacles can be navigated and the benefits reaped. My sister-in-law ended up going through three rounds at a similar time to me. We messaged regularly, about optimal needle insertion angles or the pros of nettle tea, or how we weren’t sure how many times we could do this. She was the first person I told when I got two blue lines, even before my husband. Our sons were born two weeks apart.That Time Everything Was on Fire by Kerry Downes is published by HarperCollins on 22 May (£16.99).To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Are you team spot, or team stripe? They resonate on different frequencies, in a subtle sort of a way. They are not exactly opposites, but they are not interchangeable either. Not chalk and cheese, but perhaps a bit like salt-and-vinegar and cheese-and-onion. Just different flavours.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.A stripe is brisker, while a spot is giving whimsy. I guess there’s some old-fashioned gender stereotyping mixed up in that, because stripes are worn by everyone, whereas spots are almost exclusively found in women’s fashion. Stripes feel robust and functional, while spots are daintier, more playful.The nautical associations of Breton tops and gondolier jerseys give stripes a muscular, active aura. Dots are more ethereal, like a map of a starry sky. Stripes usually signify daywear: a striped shirt looks absolutely right with a business suit, but would feel a bit off with a tuxedo, I think. Dots and spots have legs after dark – think of dots stitched into black tulle, or on sheer tights with a cocktail dress.A spot as the main event and a stripe as an accessory works better than a half-and-half divideBoth spots and stripes are everywhere right now, and the good news is there’s no need to pick a side. You can do a stripe today, and a spot tomorrow.Even better, you can do both at once. Take a look here. It works, right? It works because the spot and the stripe have more in common than divides them. They both have an allure that is rooted in feeling deeply, essentially familiar. They are part of our visual language from childhood.Spots and stripes are the patterns we see in feathers and on rocks, on leaves and flowers. They can be as exotic as a zebra’s stripes or a leopard’s spots, or as common-or-garden as the yellow-and-black blur of a bumblebee, or daisies dotted on a lawn. They aren’t always childish, though. Both can be aesthetically sophisticated, too. Richly striped upholstery is stately home-coded in the world of interior design. And a spot can be museum-worthy if it’s by Damien Hirst or Yayoi Kusama.A few thoughts on how to wear them, starting with spots and dots. I’m pretty confident with stripes, but less so with these. Spots can feel quite old-school Sloane Ranger, a little too “Princess Diana at school sports day” for comfort. To make them feel modern, the trick is to knock the edges off a little bit. Instead of going for polo-adjacent, ladies-who-lunch refinement, have some fun. Try a flat shoe. Wear something black. Choose a silhouette that is a little loose or oversized, not belted and ladylike.Marks & Spencer have gone big on the polka dot this season. TheLyocell Rich Polka Dot Maxi(£79), is a lovely black dress with white spots, with a strapless ruched bodice and a long flowing skirt. Very Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Wear it with flats instead of wedges, and a slicked-back bun rather than barrel curls, to keep it modern.View image in fullscreenRosa blue stripe platform sandals from LK BennettI know I just said I was confident about how to wear stripes, but this is not exactly true. What I have is a very narrow comfort zone, in which stripes are always blue and white, and only ever worn on my top half. Basically a striped cotton button-down shirt with vertical blue-and-white stripes, or a long-sleeved boat-neck T-shirt with horizontal ones. Nothing wrong with either of these pieces, but both are pretty basic smart-casual fits.

Either that, or wearing stripes below the waist. I am very taken with the jauntyLK Bennett sandalspictured above (RRP £329 but currently reduced), so I may do a shoe rather than a stripy trouser, even though I admit I’m taking the soft option here.How to mix spots and stripes together? The trick is not to be too fair-minded. If you divide yourself neatly in two, the prints will fight. A spot as the main event and a stripe as an accessory (or vice versa) works better than a half-and-half divide. Looks like you’ll have to pick a side after all.Hair and make up: Delilah Blakeney using Charlotte Tilbury. Styling assistant: Sam Deaman. Model: Teesta at Milk.

This Japanese-style condiment, dipping sauce and dressing made from ground sesame seeds is powerful in flavour, sweet, sour and creamy all at the same time, while the addition of grated ginger and/or garlic makes it wonderfully piquant, too. It’s also very moreish and hugely versatile, meaning you can serve it with everything from a traditionalshabu shabuhot pot to cold noodles, tofu, aubergine and slaw; in fact, it’s so tasty I have to stop myself from eating it straight from the jar. My recipe uses the leftover tahini in the bottom of a jar and comes together in the jar itself, so minimising both waste and washing-up. Simply add all the ingredients, scrape down the sides and shake (you can apply a similar method to the ends of a peanut butter jar, too, for a nutty, satay-style twist).Tahini jar goma dareThis is my take on an old favourite fromKoya in Soho, London. I hadn’t thought to recreate it at home before, but its simplicity and incredible flavour mean it’s easy and satisfying to make from scratch. It’s a super-resourceful way to turn a few scraps of tahini into a restaurant-quality condiment. I’ve listed the basic ingredients and given optional extras such as mayo (to make it extra creamy) and white miso (to add salt and umami complexity). Think of each ingredient as a seasoning, so adjust to taste to add more punch and flavour (garlic and ginger), sweetness (honey, miso), sourness (vinegar) or salt (soy, miso).MakesAbout 100ml(or enough for 2 generous servings)1 nearly empty tahini jar, with about 2-3 tbsp remaining2 tbsp soy sauce, or tamari1 tbsp rice vinegar, or other vineger such as cider vinegar2 tsp honey, or sugarOptional extras1 tbsp mayonnaise1 tsp white miso paste1 tsp toasted sesame oil1 tsp freshly grated ginger1 small garlic clove, peeled and finely gratedTo serve (all optional)Soba noodlesSauteed aubergineShredded noriFinely sliced spring onion topsToasted sesame seedsAdd the soy sauce, vinegar, honey and two tablespoons of water to the near-empty tahini jar, then add the optional mayo, white miso paste, toasted sesame oil, ginger and/or garlic. Stir with a small spatula or spoon, scraping the sides and bottom of the jar to loosen and incorporate the tahini, then screw on the lid and shake vigorously until smooth and emulsified, again scraping the sides as necessary. If the sauce seems a bit too thick, add a splash more water to loosen and shake again.Use immediately, or store in the fridge for up to a week. The sauce may thicken up in the fridge and may need a little water and another shake before using.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteSauces and graviesJapanese food and drinkSide dishesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s hard to beat the joy of messily eating one over a sink, but these flaky, American-style shortcakes, which you may recognise as similar to scones, are a brilliant mango delivery method. Meanwhile, there are few things that pistachio doesn’t improve, and here pistachio cream, which is conveniently fortified with sugar and fat, and emulsified to a smooth, spoonable paste, is paired with coffee in the form of an airy tiramisu to feed a crowd.Mango shortcakes (pictured top)Using cold grated butter and performing a few roll, stack and folds will give you towering shortcakes with tender middles and crisp tops.Prep10 minCook1 hrMakes6For the flaky scones120g very cold butter250g plain flour, plus extra for dusting10g baking powder½ tsp flaky salt30g caster sugar130g buttermilk, plus extra for brushing2 tsp granulated sugarFor the whipped cream150g greek yoghurt30g caster sugar150g double creamTo finish3-4 small ripe Indian mangoes(I like alphonso), peeled and cut into thin horizontal strips1limeGrate the cold butter on to a plate. In a large bowl, whisk the dry ingredients for the scones, then add the grated butter in four instalments, tossing well between each addition. If the mix clumps, keep tossing and squishing it between your fingertips until any large clumps have dispersed.Add the buttermilk in two instalments, stirring and tossing the mixture with a spatula to hydrate it – it will be sticky in some places and dry in others – then tip the dough on to a clean work surface and squish into a roughly 20cm x 12cm rectangle. Using a rolling pin, roll out to 30cm x 15cm, then, with a knife or dough scraper, cut it into thirds and stack them on top of each other. Turn 90 degrees, then repeat the rolling and cutting twice more, dusting with flour if the dough sticks to the pin or work surface. For the final stack, put the smoothest third on top. Press down to adhere the layers – it should be around 20cm x 14cm by this stage. Trim the outside of the dough to create clean edges, then cut the dough into six equal 6cm x 6cm squares, each weighing (75-85g. (Save and bake any offcuts as snacks.)Transfer the squares to a tray lined with baking paper, leaving 5cm space between each shortcake, then put in the freezer while you heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. (Alternatively, rest the shortcakes in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 24 hours.) Brush the tops with buttermilk, scatter over the granulated sugar, then bake for 20-22 minutes, until crisp and golden. Remove and leave to cool slightly on the tray.To finish, whip the yoghurt, sugar and cream to stiff peaks. Split each shortcake in half, spoon about 30g of the yoghurt cream on top, followed by four or five slices of mango and a grating of lime zest (if the mango is a bit underpowered, toss it with lime juice first). Top with the shortcake lid, add another spoonful of cream, a few slices of mango and a final grating of zest, and serve immediately.Pistachio tiramisuView image in fullscreenNicola Lamb’s pistachio tiramisu.Splashing out on superbly green Iranian or Sicilian pistachios will give you the most dramatic, golf-club green finish, though any will taste just as good. You will need a 20cm x 20cm tin.Prep10 minCook45 minChill4 hr+Serves8250g mascarpone200ml double cream180g pistachio cream– I useBlack Milk4 egg whites(about 120g)¼ tsp flaky salt70g caster sugarAbout 30 ladyfingers, AKA sponge fingers or savoiardi400ml strong brewed coffee, cooled to room temperatureCocoa powder, for dusting75g pistachiosIn a large bowl, whip the mascarpone and double cream to stiff peaks. Add the pistachio cream and whip again until well combined.In a second bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy, then add the flaky salt and sugar, and whip again to voluminous stiff peaks that look like shiny shaving foam.Loosen the cream and pistachio mixture with four or five tablespoons of the meringue – mix it in and beat enthusiastically: the mixture should relax a little, making it easier to fold in the rest of the meringue and retain as much air as possible. In three instalments, gently fold in the remaining meringue with a flat spatula or whisk, leaving you with a strong-looking but airy mixture.Dip each ladyfinger one by one into the coffee for just two or three seconds, then use these to line the base of a 20cm x 20cm tin. Dust lightly with cocoa powder.​​Pile half the tiramisu cream (about 400g) on top and smooth with an offset spatula or the back of a spoon. Repeat with the sponge-dunking and layering, dust with more cocoa powder, then pile the remaining cream on top. Smooth the top, cover and chill for at least four hours, and ideally overnight or up to two days.Blitz the pistachios to a fine crumb in a food processor, then scatter all over the top of the tiramisu before serving.Nicola Lamb is a pastry chef and author of the weeklyKitchen Projectsnewsletter and Sift, published by Ebury Press at £30.

The NPP is intended to bring a “one app fits all” vision to life by connecting participating car parks to a shared platform through which drivers can pay using any approved app.The NPP has been under development at the Department for Transport (DfT) since 2019, but this year it emerged that taxpayer funding for the scheme’s pilot was about to be withdrawn.On Wednesday, the government said the British Parking Association (BPA), one of the main trade bodies, would take forward the development and running of the platform.Ministers added that it would be delivered by “a consortium of industry leaders,” including three of the best-known apps – RingGo, JustPark and PayByPhone – and led by the BPA.The agreement will involve the parking sector working with councils to run the platform on a not-for-profit basis. The government will maintain oversight it.The DfT said the consortium would bring more local authorities on board “imminently”.However, connecting up potentially thousands of council and privately owned sites into a single system will be a big endeavour.Rod Dennis, a senior policy officer at the RAC, said: “The key will be ensuring as many car park operators as possible sign up.”The 10 local authorities taking part include Manchester, Liverpool, Peterborough and Coventry city councils and Oxfordshire county council. The platform is being used in 476 parking locations and handles more than 550,000 transactions a month.Lilian Greenwood, the minister for the future of roads, said: “This government is on the side of drivers and dedicated to giving everyone simpler, more flexible parking.”Explore more on these topicsMotoringAppsLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

And so too would my makeup if I hadn’t spent weeks testing new long-wear products designed to stop one’s face melting in the heat. Those of us with oily skin, an active lifestyle or a hormonal propensity for sweating or flushing, can also struggle to hold on to foundation, eyeshadow and more. But until recently, the term “long-wear” often meant dry, dragging, somewhat joyless textures and shades.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.My best new discovery is Milk’s superlativeHydro Grip Gel Tint(£34), available in 15 shades; I wear number five and it’s perfect. Its light and comfortable texture and sheer, natural-looking, summery coverage betray what is extraordinarily dogged staying power. Used in place of foundation or tinted moisturiser, this has remained perfectly intact through tears, 16-hour days and a common cold – its glow never dimming. It has a flexible, stretchy gel texture that prevents cracking or caking as skin tires and dries. Concealer, blush, powders and anything else you care to throw on top layer over happily and smoothly (it has a similar texture to a primer). It’s an unequivocal 10/10 and I already know it’ll be among my best products of 2025. For a smidge more coverage with a comparable lifespan, try Maybelline’s impressiveSuper Stay 24h Skin Tint(£13.99).New setting sprays are launching at an unprecedented rate, and I rely on them to make my morning face go the distanceOne can’t talk lasting makeup without mentioning Bobbi Brown’sLong-Wear Cream Shadow Stick(£29.50). There are countless copies of this creamy colour wand, but nothing beats the original for lasting power. I repeat myself only to alert you to the recent but overdue addition of seven new browns to the lineup. Everyone needs a brown shadow in their makeup bag. A scribble-on-and-smoosh-out with fingertip or brush gives instant definition and depth to the eyes.New setting sprays are launching at an unprecedented rate (a dedicated column on these soon) and I rely on them more than ever to make my morning face go the distance. Charlotte Tilbury’sAirbrush Flawless Setting Spray(£32) is my stalwart, but recently, I’ve loved Make Up By Mario’s excellent newSurrealSkin Soft Setting Spray(£34). This, unlike most, has no fragrance or drying alcohol, making it ideal for sensitive or dry skin types. What makes it especially good is the superior pump applicator, which gives the finest imaginable coating of minuscule droplets, resulting in a perfectly comfortable and even finish with no additional shine.Explore more on these topicsSkincareSali Hughes on beautyBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s the world’s third-biggest producer of pinot noir grapes (after Burgundy and Champagne), yet although its vineyards are energetically promoted worldwide, few shout about its tourism potential.Which is astonishing, as the area is as gorgeous as its nickname – the “Tuscany of the north” – suggests. Its green hills have a fairytale look, dotted as they are with castles and medieval abbeys, terracotta villages such as Fortunago, and remote homesteads. Visitor numbers have been rising since Covid forced Italians to make more of what’s on their doorstep, but are still low, as are prices, and it is possible to walk, cycle or drive for miles without seeing anyone.View image in fullscreenThe town of Varzi.Photograph: AGF Srl/AlamyPartly to work up an appetite but mainly because the Staffora valley merits slow exploration, we make for Varzi on two wheels, hiring bikes fromDionisio Cicliin Rivanazzano Terme. The Oltrepò’s biggest town, Voghera, on the mainline from Milan, is the starting point of theGreenway Voghera-Varzi, a 22-mile (35km) former railway perfect for relaxed cycling or walking.We stop for coffee in Salice Terme, a 19th-century spa town with a huge park, then sweep on past Godiasco and Ponte Nizza, with its railway museum, to Bagnaria, a village of cherry orchards. In early summer, we cycle past trees laden with glossy fruits, and fields with matching red poppies. At a cherry festival on the second and third Sundays in June, visitors can sample the produce, applaud prizewinners and try cherry risotto with local wine.The Oltrepò’s unspoilt nature shows in its impressive biodiversity: this area of just over 380 square miles has, for example, about double the number of species of butterfly as the UK, which has 59. There are severaldesignated butterfly walks, but we spot beauties everywhere we look, in red, orange, yellow, pale green and dramatic black and white.It’s quiet today, but we are riding what was a well-trodden trail. The Staffora valley formed part of the ancient Via del Sale, the trade route on which wool and weapons from the north of Italy were taken by mule over the Giovà pass to seaports in Liguria to exchange for precious salt for use in delicious salami, among other things.View image in fullscreenThe famous salame di Varzi salami.Photograph: Pascopix/AlamyWe enter Varzi from the west, leaving the open Greenway for a maze of narrow alleys. The town’s importance as a waypoint on the salt route shows in its porticoed streets lined with three-storey merchants’ houses. Hidden in the centre is the 13th-century Castello Malaspina, recently reopened for weddings, events, guided tours and wine and salami tastings. Current owner Enrico Odetti, descended from the family that was given the land in 1164 by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, has plans to add a dozen B&B rooms.History records a 12th-century Marquis of Malaspina offering prizedsalame di Varzito guests, and there are plenty of places in town where a 21st-century visitor can try it, but its home is in the countryside nearby. We head south to the hamlet of Bosmenso, where the fourth generation of the Buscone family (sisters Ornella, Roberta and Marina) make salami from semi-wild pigs free to rootle for acorns, and age it for at least three months, usually six. They also run the eponymous Buscone restaurant. “It’s in our DNA,” says Roberta.The Oltrepò is the world’s third-biggest producer of pinot noir grapes, after Burgundy and ChampagneAs instructed by Carlo we note the rich red and pure white of the salami – cut on a diagonal with a knife – its aromas of grassy fields, crusty bread and mild garlic, and the sweet yet deeply savoury taste. It makes a perfect antipasto with pickled veg from their garden, plus glasses of Bonarda, the Oltrepò’s classic slightly sparkling red.Over the following days we visit more wineries (see below) and eat extremely well, fuel for activities such as a circular five-mile walk through chestnut woods from the village of Moglie to the Sant’Alberto di Butrio hermitage, on a craggy hillside. The 10th-century complex is surrounded by roses, geraniums and beehives, and frescoes in one of its three chapels look as bright as they must have looked when painted 600 years ago. The route back takes in Pizzocorno village, famous for strong-smelling cheese made with milk from small, hardyvacca varzesecows.View image in fullscreenPinot noir harvest in the Oltrepò Pavese vineyards.Photograph: Independent Photo Agency Srl/AlamyNext day, we swap the middle ages for the mid-20th century at a brilliant gallery in Rivanazzano founded by locally born Franco Riccardi (artartnews.com, €10/£8.50pp), who has spent the past 50 years putting together a treasure house, in a former wine warehouse, of paintings and sculptures from the 1930s to 70s.There is also a modern art museum at Castello dal Verme in the east of the Oltrepò. Seems whether it’s pork, wine, untrodden hills or fine canvases, this corner of Lombardy has good living off to a fine art.WineriesAtCà del Ge, among high green hills, sisters Sara and Stefania, daughters of founder winemaker Enzo Padroggi, make quality rieslings from grapes normally associated with Germany, and 5,000 bottles a year ofméthode champenoisesparkling.Travaglino, a former monastery on the wooded slopes of Monte Ceresino, uses pinot noir for more deep-flavoured “champagne” but we also like a simpler red Pernero tasting of wild strawberries and balsamic vinegar.Castello di Luzzanois presided over by winemaker and sculptor Giovanella Fugazza, who has worked for more than 40 years on the estate developed by her father. A spider made of wire, bike chain, spark plugs and oyster shells sits in the courtyard, and her wine labels are all modern masterpieces. Up winding lanes in the Ardivestra valley is family-ownedCastello di Stefanago, where Giacomo Baruffaldi cultivates 20 hectares of organic biodynamic vineyards. We particularly like his Ancestrale 36 sparkling rosé.Hidden Italy: where to stay and what to do off the beaten trackRead moreRestaurantsIn the hill village ofNazzano,Il Belvederelives up to its name with sweeping views over theStaffora valleyand traditional food (plenty for vegetarians), served by owner Stefano Migliora. As well as its charcuterie,Ristorante Buscone, near Varzi, offers homemade pastas and mains such as roast duck with garden veg, or delicious caramelised pork ribs. In Salice Terme, the kitchen atIl Caminettois run by Giovanna Torti, still rattling the pans at 82. Specialities are risotto with sweet yellow peppers from Voghera, and baked-to-ordercannoncini, pastry tubes filled with cream.Where to stayAccommodation in the area is slowly increasing as tourism develops.Castello di Luzzanohas four romantic doubles in what used to be a salt route tollhouse, from €130 including breakfast on a shady terrace. Near the Greenway in Godiasco,Ristorante Italiais a great pizzeria with B&B in simple rooms from €90.

I drank it in and shuffled forward, awaiting my turn, aware I was getting “looks” – and it wasn’t difficult to see why. I had driven all night from performing at a comedy gig in London to get to my home in the Loire valley, and I was still in my work clothes. My stage wear included a check tweed Edwardian frock coat with matching weskit, navy blue dress trousers, brogue monk shoes, a smart Oxford-collared shirt and a knitted blue tie, slightly loosened. Under normal circumstances, I would not invade my local boulangerie dressed as a cross between a late 60s dandy and a roaring 20s duellist, but it had been a long drive, and I was too tired to tone it down.Plus, I had never really fit in locally anyway. We had moved there about 10 years earlier, in 2005 – a catastrophic decision, according to my agent, but a happy one for me, my wife and our then four-year-old son; the pace of life was less frenetic and we felt less hemmed in. And, as I often said only half-jokingly, it was the closest place to London we could afford to buy a house. Things had gone pretty well: my wife, being half-French and fluent, was working locally as a teacher, and my son had picked up the language more quickly than I can change a car tyre. We had two more children and I was … well, I was doing OK.In truth, I was finding it hard. My French, at the time, was barely passable and spoken with a Michael Caine accent in what I have come to call “frockney”. But that was only part of the problem. Although I desperately wanted to melt into the background, my Englishness felt painfully in contrast with the sheerFrenchnessof the vine-growing, goat-farming bucolia where I now lived. No matter what I did, I always felt as if I stood out a mile. Initially I had seen my mod stagewear as a defence at comedy gigs, a suit of armour for the laconic performance. It was only as I became more experienced and my stage act began to more closely reflect my real personality that I realised it wasn’t armour – it was me.View image in fullscreen‘I became known locally as Monsieur So British.’Photograph: Courtesy of Ian MooreI had seen how the locals regarded the second-home-owning Parisians who flock to the Loire valley at the weekends in their expensive 4x4s and their too-new wellington boots, and I felt in danger of being seen the same way: a diffident interloper, not one of us. In the end, I rarely went out. I became clumsily mute, dreading any interaction with neighbours and acquaintances. The social minefield of how many cheek kisses were acceptable left me a gibbering wreck. But standing in the boulangeriequeue, looking like I’d just flown in from a Mod Weekender crossed with a Doctor Who convention, proved to be my salvation.Despite my exhaustion, my clothing gave me the kind of stage confidence I only usually had in front of a paying audience. I greeted everyone warmly, hearty “bonjours” all around; I laughed off the cheek-kissing when I got it wrong, ordered my baguettes and croissants and strode out. I didn’t realise it at the time, but I had made my mark. I became known locally asMonsieur So British– an affectionate moniker which, ironically, meant I started to feel more at home.Mods call it peacocking – dress up, feel good, parade – and, gradually, I started to do it more often. Part of the reason I’d been hiding away, I realised, was my own misguided stubbornness. Mod clothes are part of my identity and to dilute that look to fit in had felt wrong. So for much of the last decade, I had compromised my look, and peacocked indoors. Standing in line to order my baguette, I realised I needn’t have bothered.The rural French, I have learned, rarely do formal wear themselves – but they do love to see the British dress up. I have since attended local funerals where only the undertakers and I have been wearing suits – though mine is high-collared, eight-buttoned, double-breasted, and my tie is never loosened. On Armistice Day, a public holiday here, with street parades, it’s typically just me and those in uniform who abstain from casual attire. I wore a pair of two-tone, basket-weave loafers on one of these parades to the local cenotaph and a high-ranking officer from the local airbase said how pleased he was to see an Englishman joining the commemorations.“How did you know I was English?” I asked in my frockney accent.He chuckled and pointed at my shoes.C’est La Vieby Ian Moore is out now (£7.99; Summersdale)Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA moment that changed meFrancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump did not follow through onprevious threats to introduce “large-scale” sanctions on Russiaif there was no ceasefire, but instead extolled the prospect of restarting trade with Moscow.“Russia wants to do largescale TRADE with the United States when this catastrophic ‘bloodbath’ is over, and I agree,” Trump wrote on social media.Ukraine, he added, “can be a great beneficiary on Trade in the process of rebuilding its Country”.For Europe, the question is: what next? This week the EU approved its 17th round of sanctions againstRussia, which had already been in the pipeline weeks before the latest ultimatums to Putin came and went. These were a more incremental set of measures than earlier rounds, as the EU finds it harder to agree new targets, with each sanction requiring unanimity and many big measures that command consensus having already been agreed.On Tuesday the EU added dozens of Russian business people and companies to its sanctions list, bringing the total number of individuals and entities under asset freezes and travel bans to more than 2,400. It also said it had imposed the largest-ever package targeting Putin’s shadow fleet, poorly maintained tankers using flags of convenience that enable Russia to sell oil to countries such as India, in defiance of western restrictions.After the G7 and EU banned companies on their territories from selling or supporting sales of Russian oil above $60 a barrel, European shipping companiessold dozens of ageing vessels that could be re-registered abroadin places such as India, Hong Kong, Vietnam or Seychelles that are not participating in the economic sanctions against Moscow. These vessels enable Russia to sell its oil above the price cap.A further 189 vessels were banned from accessing EU ports and services such as insurance in an effort to stop the trade, bringing the total number of ships under sanctions to 342.But for several EU countries the measures are insufficient, especially as the shadow fleet continues to grow. One EU diplomat estimated that Russia had about 800 vessels in its shadow fleet, compared with only 100 two years ago.Even before these measures were finalised, the European Commission president,Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU was preparing “hard-hitting sanctions” targeting Russian energy and banks, including measures against the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines. Nord Stream 1 was rendered unusable after a series of underwater blasts for which no one has ever claimed responsibility; Nord Stream II never received a licence. But Russia has expressed interest in reviving the gas projects connecting Russia and Germany. “The idea [of sanctions] is to dissuade any interest, notably interest from investors, from pursuing any activity in Nord Stream in the future,” von der Leyen’s spokesperson said.As well as financial sanctions and clamping down on more shadow fleet vessels, the commission is also looking at lowering the $60 oil price cap.The plans fall short of what Ukraine and its strongest allies in the EU would like. EU countries, such as those in the Nordic and Baltic regions, would likethe bloc to move urgently to cease buying Russian gas– earlier this month the commission proposed phasing out all Russian gas by the end of 2027. For now, the EU remains Russia’s largest buyer of liquified natural gas, with much of the energy eventually going to Germany, via Belgian ports.Ukraine is arguing for sanctions on foreign countries that buy Russian oil, according to leaked documents from Kyiv seen by Reuters, which was reported on Wednesday. Such secondary sanctions, which could hit large importers such as China and India, would be a significant step. The EU has so far limited itself to imposing sanctions on a few relatively small companies in China and other states that have been supplying Russia with military technology. Ukraine would also like the oil price cap reduced to $30 a barrel.Questions are growing about what the EU can do without the US – the price cap was agreed by the G7, which includes Washington. Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, has described the oil price cap as “the most important” measure in the 18th package, because of the role fossil fuels play in keeping the Russian economy afloat. She cited reports on the state of the Russian economy, which, she said, “is not doing well”.If the US moves to ease sanctions on Russia, EU insiders fear European unity could fracture. Hungary, which has routinely threatened to block sanctions, could veto the bloc’s sanctions on the Russian economy when they are up for renewal in July, an explosive move that could endthe restrictions on €210bn Russian central bank assets frozen in the EU.Some EU countries, notably including a couple of Baltic states, could reimpose sanctions at national level, but many countries do not have the legal framework. Officials are looking at other ways to “Hungary-proof” sanctions, such as imposing capital controls and steep tariffs on Russian economic sectors, rather than sanctions. EU trade policy operates on qualified majority votes, while sanctions require unanimity. But everyone still hopes to avoid this plan B.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionVladimir PutinUkraineEuropeUrsula von der LeyenRussiaOilanalysisShareReuse this content"

The suspect in the bombing,Guy Edward Bartkus, left behind writings that appear to hold fringe theories of “antinatalism” and nihilism, ideologies that oppose procreation and have a general sense of the meaninglessness of life.Officials are still looking into the beliefs behind the attack and if Bartkus can be linked to a website bolstering those viewpoints. But in the meantime, experts say the nihilistic worldview the suspect possibly adhered to is part of a growing trend of people finding smaller, niche ideologies rather than movements linked to jihadist violence that have drawn followers for decades.Brian Levin, the founding director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism and a professor emeritus at Cal State San Bernardino, described antinatalism as one of the more obscure theories he has tracked. The conceptgenerally circles around the notionthat reproduction is cruel and that more children should not be brought into a harsh world. A manifesto published online before the bombing included a hope to sterilize the planet “of the disease of life”, although ithas not yetbeen linked to Bartkus.View image in fullscreenA law enforcement official stands near evidence of body parts after an explosion outside the American Reproductive Centers office, on Saturday.Photograph: Allison Dinner/EPABut rather than the motivations behind antinatalism specifically, Levin said online spaces now allow those with lone wolf mentalities to use “what they find in the online space as kind of a hand in glove for their own idiosyncratic perspectives”.“I think that there are a couple of things that are often left out, the role that psychological distress plays, as well as how the internet can aid and abet antisocial, aggressive or suicidal behaviors,” Levin said. “When one’s grievances, paranoia, despair are amplified and then twisted into an anger that is part of a continuum, this rabbit hole particularly for these unstable folks is very easy for people to go down.”The extremely online nature of modern life, Levin said, has only exacerbated the ability of lone actors to find motivation and validation, when in the past those ideas may have existed in their own silo, without an on-ramp to violence.One dead after ‘intentional’ explosion near fertility clinic in Palm SpringsRead more“[Now] the anger and grievance can find a philosophical home in an online community, with a skill acquisition component, which can make people even more violent than they were before,” Levin said. “When psychological self-destruction has its own community, online space, and identification of legitimate targets for this aggression, that’s what you get.”Javed Ali, an associate professor at the University of Michigan and a former senior counterterrorism official for the US government, agreed. He said attacks like the one in Palm Springs were part of a growing pattern of lone wolf tactics, and that investigators were faced with the difficult task of homing in on obscure individual motivations.Ali, who spent decades working for the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, among other agencies, said there was no single profile or dominant ideology investigators can look to in hopes of stopping violent attacks. That can be difficult for officials, who in the past were more accustomed to looking at links to trends in jihadist ideologies and now have to wrangle “this whole diverse spectrum of extremist beliefs out there”.Often, that can mean a potential attacker isn’t on law enforcement’s radar – until they are. He pointed toan attempted car bombing in Times Squarein 2010. The wannabe attacker, Faisal Shahzad, built a homemade explosive device, placed it inside his SUV and drove the bomb to New York City, where it failed to detonate.“He put a car bomb together in his garage, completely not drawing the attention of anybody and drove 30 or 40 miles to New York,” Ali said, adding he was often shocked people like Shahzad were able to put together “really sophisticated” devices by themselves.View image in fullscreenThe FBI and other law enforcement officials gather evidence a day after a bomb exploded near a reproductive health facility in Palm Springs, California, on Sunday.Photograph: David Swanson/Reuters“A lot of times those people are previously not subjects of FBI investigations, they move pretty seamlessly in this world from radicalization to mobilization and they’re able to conceal or not reveal those steps that probably would get you on the radar screen,” he said.“It’s so hard to stop them,” Ali added. “It’s so hard to identify them in the first place because things are very fuzzy.”Levin went on to say while Americans are largely afforded great freedoms under the first amendment – with even sociopathic viewpoints largely protected – the state of the internet and social media had left a vacuum into which those in psychological distress can fall into. Safeguards like notifications on search browsers alerting people to help and support could be a vehicle to help counter that black hole.“You’re not going to be able to eliminate this,” he said. “But what we can do is offer off-ramps and help that can hopefully be a choice for people who are otherwise careening without any speed bumps towards a violent or suicidal demise.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsCaliforniaWest CoastFertility problemsHealthIVFfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, housebuilders in the UK do not yet have the desire to build houses this way as it requires site staff be motivated to build in a way that prevents air leakage and to care about build quality, something that is sorely lacking here.The higher build cost for the fabric would be offset by the absence or reduction in the cost of heating installation. We have yet to see how the future homes standard will compare, but I for one am not holding my breath.Adrian BirchBrockweir, GloucestershireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

To achieve this and deal with the problem of prison overcrowding, we do not need to build more prisons. Community sentences require more resources so they can constructively challenge offending behaviour while keeping convicted individuals in touch with their responsibilities to families and communities.For those in prison, this would also allow for the application of the Texas model – a promising form of prison reform that is not only cost-saving but has also reduced crime and recidivism rates in that state. Its success lies significantly in prioritising incarceration for violent offences.It also emphasises in-prison and community-based treatment programmes for non-violent offenders, many of whose crimes intersect with substance abuse and/or mental health problems.Several other US states have found the Texas model fits with their wish to curtail prison numbers without jeopardising public safety.Maurice VanstoneEmeritus professorof criminology and criminal justice,Swansea UniversityAnita Kalunta-CrumptonProfessorof administration of justice, Texas Southern UniversityPhilip PriestleyIndependent scholarAs welcome as it is that the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has acknowledged the prison crisis, her solutions treat symptoms, not causes (Jail time for recalled offenders to be limited to free up prison places, 14 May). Limiting recall periods to 28 days may provide temporary relief, but the admission that prisons in England and Wales will still be 9,000 places short by 2028 exposes the futility of building our way out of this crisis.We cannot continue this cycle of emergency releases and quick fixes. The government must prioritise evidence-based alternatives: community sentences, electronic monitoring and intensive supervision programmes that cost less and reduce reoffending more effectively than prison.Most importantly, we need investment in prevention – addressing the social determinants of crime through education, mental health services and employment support.

They’re having to cope with the consequences of the Covid pandemic, the cost of living crisis, social media, and school, family and relationship pressures.We at the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy are pleased that the government recognises the importance of supporting children in all schools, but this announcement falls short of what’s needed. The plan will do little to meet the needs of children who need more than pastoral care and the low-level interventions provided through mental health support teams (MHSTs), but don’t require a referral to psychiatrists or child and adolescent mental health services.We estimate that about 730,000 children and young people each year will fall through the gaps in support available as part of this rollout. Instead, the government should have focused on an enhanced MHST+ model, which includes a clear referral pathway to funded counselling provision.It’s not just “grit” that will support children with their problems. It’s having access, when needed, to a trained professional counsellor. But that vital support is disappointingly missing from this plan.Martin BellHead of policy& public affairs,BACPI had high hopes that a Labour government might start to look seriously at how changes in education policy under Michael Gove might be impacting young people’s mental health and school attendance. Instead the focus is on fostering “grit”. My daughter is in the middle of GCSEs. The content for each subject is so great that when we put all the books, notes and revision aids into large carrier bags, there were 11 in total.Schools have had to cut music, breaktimes and art to ensure core subjects are covered. Some schools have gone doolally about punishing kids for minor misdemeanours, like forgetting a pen. Teachers are leaving the profession in droves. We keep trying to fix the kids, when we need to fix the problem. Maybe it’s the politicians that need to find the “grit” to focus on the causes, not the consequences.Caroline O’DwyerLondonA growing wealth of evidence shows that sustained access to nature and nature-based learning can improve health, wellbeing, development and resilience. Such approaches support children who struggle in traditional learning settings and stretch those who thrive in them.My organisation has seen this first-hand in ourStepping Stones to Natureprogramme. Embedding meaningful curriculum-linked nature activities into the school week, in some of England’s most deprived communities, has led to immediate improvements in wellbeing, confidence, communication and concentration.Nature should not be seen as an add-on. The government should explore how embedding it into classrooms, curriculums and school grounds – and making full use of the breadth of our green and blue spaces, from urban parks to protected landscapes – can improve outcomes in the short and long term.James MetcalfeDirector, North York Moors TrustHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The Oval Office meeting withSouth Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, started with exchanges of pleasantries, beforeDonald Trumpsaid “turn the lights down” and a video was played to support his false claims that white South African farmers are being murdered for their race.Ramaphosa came prepared with champion white South African golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen, whom thegolf-mad Trump referred to as “friends”, as well as South Africa’s richest person, Johann Rupert.Ramaphosa, who led the African National Congress (ANC) party’s delegation in the talks that ended apartheid white-minority rule three decades ago, needed to play his strongest cards.In February, Trumpsigned an executive ordercutting aid to South Africa, accusing it of “unjust racial discrimination” against the white Afrikaner minority, which ruled the country during apartheid. The order criticised a South African law allowing land expropriation in limited circumstances and set up a program to bring Afrikaners to the US as refugees. The first grouparrived earlier this month.Trump ambushes South African president with video and false claims of anti-white racismRead moreSouth African media had speculated about whether Ramaphosa was walking into a televised trap, like Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had just a few months before.The White House video was likely a surprise for the South Africans. It spliced together clips of Julius Malema, the leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) opposition party, saying “We are going to occupy land” and “We must never be scared to kill”, before singing the controversial Kill the Boer song (“Boer” is another name for Afrikaners and means “farmer” in Afrikaans).Malema, whose populism is designed to shock – and whose EFF won just 9.5% of the vote in South Africa’s 2024 election – will probably be thrilled with the attention, after being buoyed up by South African courts ruling that Kill the Boer is not meant to be taken literally.Former South African president Jacob Zuma, now leading his own opposition party, uMkhonto weSizwe (MK), also featured in the video, singing in Zulu: “We are going to shoot them. They are going to run.”The video ended with a drone shot of white crosses lining a road where vehicles were queued. Trump said they were paying respects to more than 1,000 murdered white farmers. Ramaphosa said he had never seen the video, which South African-born billionaire and Trump adviser Elon Musk reshared after it wasposted on X in March.Trump then whipped out a sheaf of printed-out news articles, intoning “death … death … death” before handing it over to Ramaphosa.It was not immediately clear where the white crosses had been filmed or even whether the footage was real. TheWhitkruis Monumentis a memorial to dead South African farmers, but the crosses are clustered on a hillside on private land.While there have been farm murders involving horrific violence, killers interviewed in jail told Rudolph Zinn, a University of Limpopo professor, that they targeted victims of all races for cash and valuables. In the last quarter of 2024, South African policerecorded12 murders on farms, including Black-owned smallholder plots, out of almost 7,000 murders across the country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also defended the DA’s coalition with the ANC to keep out the “rabble” EFF and MK parties.The two golfers’ words were perhaps less helpful. Els was cryptic: “Two wrongs don’t make a right.” Goosen spoke of his brother’s “constant battle” with people trying to burn down and take away his farm.However, their presence could snap Trump out of attack mode. “I respect champions,” he said. “I think the country is very lucky. They really wanted to be here, these two. They could have been on a beautiful fairway.”South Africa’s most potent defender was Rupert, whose luxury goods conglomerate Richemont owns Cartier. Referring to Malema and Zuma, he said: “I’m their No 1 target.”Rupert pointed out that all South Africans are targets of crime. He said how much his wife loved JD Vance’s autobiography and begged for Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite internet service at police stations.It remains to be seen, though, whether a fellow billionaire and a few rounds with South Africa’s finest golfers will be enough to mollify Trump and persuade him to attend the G20 summit in Johannesburg in November.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationSouth AfricaDonald TrumpUS foreign policyUS politicsAfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Murphy, the judge, said that little amount of time was “plainly insufficient”.An eighth man in the group was a citizen ofSouth Sudan, according to the Department of Homeland Security.Jonathan Ryan, a lawyer for Burmese man known in court documents as NM, who was expelled, said he initially received notice that his client was being sent to Libya, before being informed that client was actually being sent to SouthAfrica. About two hours after the second notice, Ryan was told his client was being sent to South Sudan.“I’ve never in 20 years seen anything close to this happening,” said Ryan, who has been representing clients detained in Pearsall, Texas, since 2005.Furthering the confusion, a lawyer for the Department of Justice first indicated that the Burmese deportee would ultimately be sent to Myanmar, but the government has not provided details about the final destination of the flight.Murphy ordered the administration to clarify the facts of NM’s removal, including the moment that officials first decided it would be impractical or impossible to remove him to Burma, and the time and reasoning behind the reversal of that decision and determination that NM should be sent to Burma after all.Ryan said his client was part of an ethnic minority in Myanmar, and faced immense risks if he were to be sent there. “Whether he’s sent to Burma or South Sudan, he is at risk of harm – of abuse, exploitation, death,” Ryan said.“In fact, this is a death penalty case with traffic court-level procedure,” said Ryan. “Or rather, this procedure wouldn’t even fly in a traffic court.”Burma is in the midst of a civil war, and recently experienced its worst earthquake disaster in more than a century. Meanwhile South Sudan, the world’s youngest country, has widely been described as being on the verge of descending into another episode of civil war.Flight trackers and a report from the New York Times suggest that the flight carrying deportees in question may have stopped inDjibouti, not South Sudan.“This is so opaque and obscure,” Ryan said, “I have no clarity.”In an earlier briefing on Wednesday, a homeland security spokesperson acknowledged the deportation was occurring, but refused to say whether the final destination wasSouth Sudan.“We conducted a deportation flight from Texas to remove some of the most barbaric, violent individuals illegally in the United States. These are the monsters that the district judge is trying to protect,” the spokeswoman, Tricia McLaughlin, said.McLaughlin went on to add: “It is absolutely absurd for a district judge to try to dictate the foreign policy and national security of the United States.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Homeland security officials claimed that they had been convicted of murder, armed robbery and other serious crimes.Last month, Murphy had issued an injunction that required any people being removed to a third country to receive due process. After reports of the apparent South Sudan flight, the judge told Elianis Perez, a justice department lawyer: “I have a strong indication that my preliminary injunction order has been violated.”In anemailto his lawyer, the spouse of a Vietnamese man believed to have been sent to South Sudan wrote: “Please help! … They cannot be allowed to do this.”South Sudan’s police spokesperson, Maj Gen James Enoka,toldthe Associated Press on Wednesday that no migrants had arrived.Enoka said that if they did, they would be investigated and those found not to be from the country would be “re-deported to their correct country”.Immigration lawyers have accused theTrump administrationof violating Murphy’s order several times in the past month, including in the case of a planned flight of Laotian, Vietnamese and Filipino immigrants to Libya and the expulsion of a Guatemalan man to Mexico.During Wednesday’s hearing, Murphy also chastised government lawyers for their handling of the case of the Guatemalan man, known as OCG. Lawyers initially said in a sworn declaration that OCG had been informed he was being sent to Mexico and confirmed that he was not afraid to go there, but the justice department later said the declaration was erroneous, and it could not confirm that OCG had been informed he was being sent to Mexico.“This is a really big deal,” Murphy said. “It’s a big deal to lie to a court under oath.”Following the hearing, Murphy issued a clarification to his prior preliminary injunction in which he said any removals of immigrants to third countries should be preceded by a formal notice, and individuals much have at least 10 days to evaluate and contest the removal.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationSouth SudanUS politicsMassachusettsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But the sector is marred by mismanagement and corruption and despite its vast resources, the country is underdeveloped, with most places lacking electricity, paved roads and other infrastructure.About two thirdsof its population live in extreme poverty.South Sudan also experiences some of the world’s most punishing climate phenomena, including extreme flooding, which displaced 380,000 people last year.In March, authorities put Riek Machar, the country’s first vice-president and main opposition leader, under house arrest,accusing him of agitating his supporters to cause a rebellion.Earlier that month, the White Army, a community militia loyal to Machar, had launched attacks against the country’s military in Nasir county and overran an army base.The militia said it had acted in self-defence. The government responded by bombarding areas where the group was based and arrested opposition figures.‘They came for us, to take our shelters and kill us’: how violence returned to a shattered South SudanRead moreMachar’s party, SPLM-IO, said his arrest had in effect collapsed the peace deal that ended the 2013-2018 civil war in which an estimated 400,000 people were killed in fighting between Nuer fighters loyal to Machar and Dinka forces backing Salva Kiir, the current president.This year’s renewed tensions have put the deal to the test and shaken a fragile peace, with the United Nations warning that South Sudan wason the brinkof relapsing into widespread conflict.Machar remains under house arrest and government offensiveshave continuedin many parts of the north-east, where Nasir is located.On Tuesday, Kiir promoted second vice-president Benjamin Bol Mel as the deputy chairperson of his SPLM party. In his new role, Bol Mel, who is widely viewed as Kiir’s chosen successor, would become acting president if Kiir stepped down.The news about deportations of South Asians to South Sudan comes weeks aftera standoffbetween South Sudan and the US after the US sent a Congolese man to South Sudan, claiming he was South Sudanese.Explore more on these topicsSouth SudanAfricaUS immigrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

South African officials and businesspeople are also worried that Congress will not renew the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) when it expires in September, ending tariff-free access to the US for goods including citrus fruits, nuts and cars.“The trade relations are the most important, that’s what brought us here. We want to come out of the United States with a really good trade deal,” Ramaphosa told South African reporters in the US.“Ernie Els was actually the person who, over the past month talked Trump into agreeing to the meeting,” said the billionaire Johann Rupert, the founder of Switzerland-based luxury goods conglomerate Richemont, which owns jewellery brand Cartier, who will also join the trip.Rupert has known Trump since 1996 and has played golf with the US president and Els. Rupert, thought to be South Africa’s richest man,told South Africa’s News24that he and Els visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in March 2024, months before Trump’s re-election, to ask him to keep AGOA.Far from being victims of a genocide – as in the telling of Trump, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the South African-born billionaire Elon Musk – Rupert, Els and Goosen are examples of successful white Afrikaners, a minority descended from mainly Dutch colonists who ruled SouthAfricaduring its decades of apartheid, legally mandated racial segregation and discrimination in favour of white people.South Africa was set to offer Musk a deal to bring his Starlink internet service to the country, Bloombergreportedon Tuesday. Musk has railed against affirmative action laws that would have required him to give up 30% of equity to non-white investors.

How drought and a youth exodus threaten Mexico’s prized cocoaRead more“These aren’t just abstract threats,” said the lead author of the report, Camilla Hyslop. “They are already playing out in ways that negatively affect businesses and jobs, as well as the availability and price of food for consumers, and they are only getting worse.”The researchers mapped trade data from Eurostat on to two rankings of environmental security to assess the level of exposure for three staple foods and three critical inputs into the EU’s food system.They used a ranking of climate readiness from the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index, which combines a country’s vulnerability to climate damages with its access to financial and institutional support, and a ranking of biodiversity intactness from the UK Natural History Museum, which compares the current abundance of wild species to pre-modern levels.They found the majority of imports came from countries they ranked “low-medium” on the climate scale and “low-medium” or “medium” on the biodiversity scale.Some food products were particularly exposed. The EU imported 90% of its maize from countries with low-medium climate readiness and 67% from countries with medium or lower biodiversity intactness, the report found.For cocoa, a key ingredient in the chocolate industry thatEuropedoes not grow itself, the import exposure was 96.5% for climate preparedness and 77% on the biodiversity scale, the report found.The industry is already struggling with rises in the price of sugar, driven in part byextreme weather events, and supply shortages of cocoa. Most of its cocoa comes from west African countries facing overlapping climate and biodiversity risks.The report, which was commissioned by the European Climate Foundation, argued that large chocolate manufacturers should invest in climate adaptation and biodiversity protection in cocoa-growing countries.“This is not an act of altruism or ESG [sustainable finance], but rather a vital derisking exercise for supply chains,” the authors wrote. “Ensuring farmers are in their supply chains paid a fair price for their produce would allow them to invest in the resilience of their own farms.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

I have a plan. Do you?  | George MonbiotRead morePaul Behrens, an environmental researcher at the University of Oxford and author of a textbook on food and sustainability, who was not involved in the research, said the findings painted an “extremely worrying picture” for food resilience.“Policymakers like to think of the EU as food-secure because it produces quite a lot of its own food,” he said. “But what this report shows is that the EU is vulnerable to climate and biodiversity risks in some vital food supply chains.”The report found coffee, rice and soy had fewer risks overall but noted hotspots of concern.Uganda, which provided 10% of the EU’s coffee in 2023, had low climate preparedness and low-medium biodiversity intactness, the report found.Joseph Nkandu, founder of the National Union ofCoffeeAgribusinesses and Farm Enterprises in Uganda, called for more access to international climate finance to help farmers become more resilient in the face of worsening weather.“The weather in Uganda is no longer predictable,” he said. “Heatwaves, prolonged dry spells and erratic rains are withering our coffee bushes and damaging production.”Marco Springmann, a food researcher at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the research, said a shift to healthier and more sustainable diets would be needed for food systems to withstand climate shocks.“About a third of grains and basically all imported soy is used to feed animals,” he said. “Aiming to make those supply chains more resilient therefore misses the point that this supports the very products that are to a large degree responsible for what is being tried to protect from.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisEuropean UnionChocolateEuropeFoodBiodiversityUgandanewsShareReuse this content"

But this time, the animals aren’t fleeing a flood, but rather insecurity, fear and anxiety,” Zazueta said.Since September, Culiacán has been the epicenter ofa bloody war between factions of the Sinaloa drug cartelthat has left more than 1,200 people dead and 1,400 missing, according to official figures.The cartel is one of six Mexican drug-trafficking groupsdesignated terrorist organizationsby the United States.Regular roadblocks and armed clashes in the region made it difficult for the sanctuary’s workers to keep the captive wildlife fed, another reason to relocate them.“The animals’ health began to suffer,” Zazueta said, adding that at least a ton of beef and chicken was needed every three days to feed the animals.Workers sedated the most dangerous of them, including lions and tigers, so they could be placed in cages for the 220km (nearly 140-mile) road trip.Two large containers and a huge crane were needed to load the elephants on to trailers.Monkey shot dead as Mexican cartels’ passion for exotic pets leaves bloody tollRead moreThe final destination is a site called Bioparque El Encanto, located in the seaside resort town of Mazatlán on Sinaloa’s Pacific coast and owned by a local businessman, Zazueta said.Big cats and other exotic animals have long been found at Mexican ranches and other properties owned by drug traffickers.Since September, federal authorities have discovered at least 14 big cats, some seized in raids and others found in abandoned houses believed to be used for criminal activities.They were given a new home at the Ostok refuge, whose director said the mass animal transfer sent a “painful message” about the situation in the Sinaloa state capital.“If animals can no longer live in Culiacán, who can?” Zazueta said.Explore more on these topicsMexicoWildlifeDrugs tradeAnimalsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

We also know that resolving these cases and bringing British citizens home to the UK depends on robust, principled, strategic action by the UK government.”At a press conference in London on Wednesday, Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, lead international counsel for Lai and his son, Jimmy, said there had been “outrageous foot dragging” in Lai’s case, involving charges under the city’spunitive national security law.She said it was supposed to last 30 days when it started after multiple adjournments in December 2023 but a current six-month pause meant closing submissions would not take place until August.Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, said: “I think we do need to be looking at government squarely in the eye and saying … ‘How dare you not prioritise the protection of your citizens from torture, from profound injustice and from the risk of death?’”An emotionalAnoosheh Ashoori, 71, who was released in Iran at the same time as Zaghari-Ratcliffe, said: “Luckily, I was only 116 days in a solitary confinement. With someone who has been there for such a long time, even for me it is difficult to imagine how resilient he must be and what he has been through.”The signatories urge Starmer to urgently accede to theLai’s son’s request for a meetingwith the prime minister.Gallagher said that raising Lai’s case bilaterally was not enough, the UK government had to make the Chinese understand “that actually there is a conditionality or an impact if they don’t engage”.A UK government spokesperson said Lai’s case was a priority, adding: “We continue to call on the Hong Kong authorities to end their politically motivated prosecution and immediately releaseJimmy Lai.”Explore more on these topicsJimmy LaiKeir StarmerHong KongChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

But Huang told the Computex tech forum in Taipei that the controls had instead spurred on Chinese developers.“The local companies are very, very talented and very determined, and the export control gave them the spirit, the energy and the government support to accelerate their development,” Huang told media the Computex tech show in Taipei.“I think, all in all, the export control was a failure.”A journey through the hyper-political world of microchipsRead more“China has a vibrant technology ecosystem, and it’s very important to realise thatChinahas 50% of the world’s AI researchers, and China is incredibly good at software,” Huang said.Nvidia, whichdesigns high-end GPUs, has beenbattered by US chip export controls. Huang said on Wednesday the company had written off “billions of dollars” in sales, and it’s share of China’s AI chip market had fallen from almost 95% at the start of the Biden administration to 50%.Last monthHuang made a surprise visit to Beijing, where he met with the head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, according to Chinese state media, and the DeepSeek founder, Liang Wenfeng, according to the Financial Times.His visit came just days after further US restrictions banned shipments to China of Nvidia’s H20 datacentre GPUs, a lower-powered version of other Nvidia chips which was designed specifically to comply with Biden-era restrictions.The US government told Nvidia the new rules were designed to address the risk that its products might be “used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China”.Huang’s Beijing meeting with Liang was to discuss new chip designs for the AI company that would not trigger the new US bans, the FT report said.Last week the Trump administration rescinded some of the existing controls on chip sales to China, after some countries said they were being shut out from crucial technology needed to develop artificial intelligence.But it also unveiled fresh guidelines for other countries, warning companies that using Chinese-made hi-tech AI semiconductors, specifically tech company Huawei’s Ascend chips, could put them in breach of existing US export controls.In response China accused the US of “abusing export controls to suppress and contain China”. The commerce ministry said on Wednesday the warning was “typical unilateral bullying and protectionism, which seriously undermine the stability of the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain”.It also warned that “any organisation or individual that enforces or assists in enforcing such measures” could be in violation of Chinese law.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaChinaTaiwanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

But speaking at a fundraiser last weekend, Etō said he had “never bought rice myself because my supporters donate so much to me that I can practically sell it”.Etō was replaced on Wednesday by Shinjirō Koizumi, a former environment minister whoran unsuccessfullyagainst Ishiba for the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) leadership last autumn.Etō’s comment incensed consumers, who are having to pay nearly double for a bag of rice compared with a year ago, according to figures published in April.“I asked myself whether it is appropriate for me to stay at the helm [of the agriculture ministry] at a critical time for rice prices, and I concluded that it is not,” Etō added, according to the Kyodo news agency.“Once again, I apologise to people for making extremely inappropriate comments as minister when they are struggling with surging rice prices.”Japan’sriceshortfall has been blamed on several factors, including poor harvests due to hot weather in 2023 and panic-buying prompted by a “megaquake” warning in 2024. Wholesalers and distributors are also thought to be hoarding rice stocks in anticipation of further shortages.Ishiba had earlier apologised for Etō’s remarks.The ongoing rice crisis and rising household food and energy bills havedented the popularityof Ishiba’s government, weeks before it faces voters in upper house elections that could determine his future as prime minister.In a recent Kyodo survey, 87% of respondents were dissatisfied with the government’s handling of the rice prices, while approval ratings for Ishiba’s cabinet have sunk to their lowest since he took office last October.The average price of rice sold at supermarkets in the week to 11 May reached a record ¥4,268 yen ($29) for 5kg, up from ¥4,214 the previous week and around double the price of a year ago.In April, Japanimported rice from South Koreafor the first time in a quarter of a century in an attempt to address growing consumer anger.Junya Ogawa, secretary general of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic party, described Etō’s comments as “extremely inappropriate, out of touch and intolerable”.Etō conceded that his remarks had angered his wife. “She told me that she does buy rice when the donated rice runs out,” he said. “It’s not like our family is living entirely off of rice given to us as gifts.”Explore more on these topicsJapanRiceFoodAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Beijing has alsodelivered significant aid,infrastructureandother fundingto Pacific Island countries.Tensions rose earlier this year when the Cook Islands government unveiled the details of astrategic partnership deal with China, after New Zealand expressed “significant concern” about a lack of transparency over the agreement.The Cook Islands has operated as a self-governing nation in “free association” with New Zealand for 60 years. Its roughly 17,000 citizens hold New Zealand citizenship and there areobligations between the two nationsto regularly consult on matters of defence and security.Mapped: the vast network of security deals spanning the Pacific, and what it meansRead moreLater in February, New Zealand and Australian officials said that China had conducted live-fire exercises in international waters between the two nations, giving little notice and forcing commercial airlines to divert flights.Challenging China – New Zealand’s largest trading partner – can be a delicate process and as such Wellington has historically taken a more conciliatory approach than Australia or its other Five Eyes security partners, Canada, the US and the UK.But Peters raised his concerns about the agreement and the live-firing drills with China’s foreign minister Wang Yi in Beijing shortly after the incidents.“We made sure that they understood what our position was,” Peters said, adding that New Zealand’s relationship with China remained strong.“If you can’t talk frankly to them, its not a great relationship but we’ve got a good relationship … because we can say what we think.”Defence, security and development in the Pacific will be high on the agenda when Peters and Wong meet in Adelaide on Friday for their six-monthly foreign ministers’ consultations. Cooperation with Australia had “never been more important”, Peters said.Peters and Wong have both travelled “extensively” in the region to shore up New Zealand and Australia’s relationship with their smaller Pacific neighbours, he said.“You cannot to this over zoom, or over correspondence, you’ve got to do it face-to-face.”With the exception of Kiribati, Peters has visited all of the Pacific Island Forum nations during his 18 months in the role. This week, Wong is visiting Vanuatu, Tonga and Fiji, in her first standalone trip after Labor’s landslide re-election.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandNew Zealand politicsWinston PetersPacific islandsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He said the Muslim head covering worn by young girls “seriously undermines gender equality and the protection of children”.Attal toldLe Parisienhe also wanted to introduce a criminal offence of coercion for parents who make their daughters aged under 18 wear the veil.Attal’s proposals were criticised by some on the left. The Socialist party lawmaker Jérôme Guedj said Attal was “chasing the far right” and turning French secularism against Muslims.Macron’s office said the report on the Muslim Brotherhood in France would be published by the end of this week. The Élysée Palace said that because of the “seriousness” of its findings, the government had been tasked to make proposals swiftly.Agence France-Presse, which obtained a copy of the report, said it pointed to the spread of Islamism “from the bottom up”. This was an apparent reference to municipal politics, charities, schools and sports groups. The report said this constituted “a threat in the short to medium term”.It is not certain if restrictions on the Muslim headscarf will be among the proposals made as a result of the report. In the 2022 presidential race, when Macron was re-elected, the far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who came second, proposedbanningthe wearing of the Muslim headscarf by any woman in all public spaces in France.What has 20 years of banning headscarves done for France? | Rokhaya DialloRead moreUnder current French legislation, civil servants in state buildings, including schools and hospitals, cannot wear obvious religious symbols such as a Christian crucifix, Jewish kippah, Sikh turban or Muslim headscarf.France is a secular republic built on a clear separation of church and state, intended to foster equality for all private beliefs. The state remains neutral in terms of religion but must safeguard everyone’s freedom to practise their own faith.In 2004, France banned girls from wearing Islamic headscarves in state schools – along with banning all other religious symbols such as crosses or turbans – arguing schools must be free of all religion. There is also debate in government over proposing a new law to ban the Muslim headscarf in domestic sports competitions.The Élysée said it had been important to commission a report on the Muslim Brotherhood. “The movement is present inEuropeand its target is clearly Europe,” an Élysée official said, adding that it was necessary to “raise awareness within the European Union”.But the Élysée also said: “We are all perfectly aligned in saying that we must not lump all Muslims together.”The official said: “We are fighting against Islamism and its radical excesses.”The report comes at a time when national politics in France is focused on issues of national identity and Islam, with Le Pen’s far right increasing its share of the vote.Bruno Retailleau, the hardline rightwing interior minister, was recently chosen to head the traditional right party Les Républicains, after its former leader Éric Ciotti left to join an alliance with Le Pen.Retailleau told the media before Wednesday’s meeting that political Islamism was “quietly infiltrating sporting, cultural, social and others associations” and its ultimate aim was to “tip the whole of French society into sharia [law]”.The French Muslim council issued a statement warning against targeting all Muslims. It said the state “must above all not feed a generalised suspicion towards Muslims in France”.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropeIslamGabriel AttalReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

The delegation comprised ambassadors and diplomats representing 31 countries, including Italy, Canada, Egypt, Jordan, the UK, China and Russia.The group was on an official mission organised by the Palestinian Authority to observe the humanitarian situation there. The Israeli military said the visit had been approved but the delegation “deviated from the approved route” and Israeli soldiers fired warning shots to distance them from the area.The Canadian, British, French and other European ministers summoned Israeli ambassadors in their respective capitals to explain the “unacceptable” incident, which will fuel already growing international anger and concern as Israel continues its offensive in Gaza and ramps up the expansion of settlements in the West Bank that are illegal under international law.Germany, a longtime Israel ally, condemned what it called “unprovoked firing,” while Canada, Turkey and the EU demanded an investigation.“We expect an immediate explanation of what happened. It’s totally unacceptable,” Canadian prime minister Mark Carney told a press conference. Four Canadian diplomats were part of the group.A spokesperson for UN secretary general António Guterres also urged Israel to conduct a “thorough investigation”.“It is clear that diplomats who are doing their work should never be shot at, attacked in any way, shape or form, and their safety, their inviolability, must be respected at all times,” said the spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric.Egypt said the incident “violates all diplomatic norms”.The Palestinian foreign ministry accused Israel of having “deliberately targeted” the diplomatic delegation with live fire.The IDF said it regretted “the inconvenience caused” and that senior officials would contact diplomats to inform them of the results of its internal investigation into the incident.View image in fullscreenThe diplomatic delegation visits the Jenin refugee camp and conducts inspections in the West Bank.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyJenin was the focus of a big Israeli assault in January that forced tens of thousands of Palestinians from their homes, one of the largest West Bank displacements in years.A new wave of airstrikes and artillery shelling killed at least 82 people inGazaon Wednesday, including several women and a week-old infant, the Gaza health ministry and hospital officials said.In Khan Younis, where Israel recently ordered new evacuations before an expected major attack into the southern city, 24 people were killed, including 14 from the same family, Palestinian officials reported.Late on Wednesday, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said “all of the Gaza Strip will be under the Israeli army’s control” by the end of its intensified offensive. Amid growing international pressure on Israel to allow food to reach starving Palestinians, he said: “We must avoid a humanitarian crisis in order to preserve our freedom of operational action.”View image in fullscreenSmoke rises from an Israeli airstrike south of Khan Younis, Gaza, on 21 May.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APAbout 100 aid trucks have entered Gaza since Monday when Netanyahu’s government agreed to lift the 11-week blockade that has led to the territory facing a “critical risk of famine”. On Wednesday, several dozen passed through the Kerem Shalom checkpoint but their cargos had yet to be distributed late on Wednesday.Abdel-Nasser al-Ajramy, the head of the bakery owners’ society in Gaza, said at least 25 bakeries that had been told they would receive flour from the World Food Programme had seen nothing and there had been no relief from the hunger for people waiting for food.Much of Gaza’s 2.3 million population rely for survival on free bakeries and community kitchens. Almost all have shut down.1:24Aid trucks trickle into Gaza while airstrikes continue – video report“There is no flour, no food, no water,” said Sabah Warsh Agha, a 67-year-old woman from the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya. “We used to get water from the pump, now the pump has stopped working.

Even the US, the country’s most important ally, has shown signs of losing patience with Netanyahu.On Tuesday, Britain announced the suspension of talks with Israel on a free trade deal, and has, along with France and Canada, threatened “concrete actions” if Israel continues its offensive and restrictions on the free flow of aid.Separately, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the bloc was reviewing its agreement with Israel governing trade ties over its conduct of the war in Gaza. The pact specifies thatall signatoriesmust show “respect for human rights and democratic principles”.The EU’s review could be completed relatively quickly as officials could draw on a 34-page report compiled late last year that details multiple allegations of systemic violations of international law during the conflict by both Israel and Hamas.What will it take to stop Israel’s attacks on Gaza? – podcastRead moreThe report, seen by the Guardian, includes UN statistics on casualty figures and concludes that 44% of those killed in the first months of the Israeli offensive were children. It also lists Israeli strikes on hospitals and stresses that under international humanitarian law, states have the “negative obligation” not to aid or assist in violations of international humanitarian law by parties to a conflict.In Jerusalem, the MP Ayman Odeh, a Palestinian citizen of Israel, was removed from the Knesset podium by security after accusing the government of killing 19,000 children in Gaza and waging war on civilians and the innocent.Earlier this week, Yair Golan, a leftwing opposition leader, drew a furious response from the government and its supporters when he said “a sane country doesn’t kill babies as a hobby” and that Israel risked becoming a “pariah state among the nations”.Golan, a former deputy commander of the Israeli military, is leader of one of the bigger minority parties in Israel’s parliament. His words – and similar comments made by the former prime minister Ehud Olmert in an interview with the BBC – represented a rare focus on Palestinian suffering by leading Israeli political figures. Most domestic criticism of the war has centred on the fate of hostages held in Gaza.Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, dismissed the criticism as “shocking”.“While IDF soldiers are fighting Hamas, there are those who are strengthening the false propaganda against the state of Israel,” Netanyahu, who leads the most rightwing government in Israel’s history, said.Indirect ceasefire talks in the Qatari capital of Doha have faltered. Israel recalled much of its negotiating team on Tuesday, saying it would leave lower-level officials in place instead. Qatari leaders, who are mediating negotiations, said there was a large gap between the two sides that they had been unable to bridge.The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 others. The militants are still holding 58 captives, about a third of whom are believed to be alive, after most of the others were returned in ceasefire agreements or other deals.Israel’s ensuing offensive, which has destroyed large swaths of Gaza, has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.Explore more on these topicsWest BankIsraelPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warGazaMiddle East and north AfricaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The fence also uses cameras and sensors to distinguish between people and animals crossing.Satellite images,published in the New York Times, appear to show an expansion of military infrastructure near the Finnish border, including rows of tents, military vehicles, renovations to fighter jet shelters and construction on a previously unused helicopter base.Nurmi said: “They are changing structures and we are seeing moderate preparations when it comes to building infrastructure close to our borders, meaning that they will, once the war inUkrainehopefully ends, start to bring back the forces that have been fighting in Ukraine, especially land forces.”While this was not unexpected sinceFinlandjoined Nato at record speed in 2023 after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Nurmi said they were following the preparations “very closely”.“They are doing it in phases. I would say it is still moderate numbers. It’s not big construction, but in certain places building new infrastructure and preparing, bringing new equipment in,” he said.“You also have to evaluate whether they are preparing to send more troops to Ukraine or preparing to build up their forces close to our border. But I guess they are doing both.”Responding to Russia’s changing activities, Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday he was “not worried about it at all”, adding that Finland and Norway were “going to be very safe”.Echoing the president’s sentiment, Nurmi said there was “no immediate military threat towards Finland or Nato from this direction”.He added: “What happened right after the Ukrainian attack was we applied for Nato membership and then when we were accepted Russia announced they would start to change their military posture across the border.”Finnish citizens have become accustomed to the looming threat from its eastern neighbour but hundreds are still signing up for training courses to prepare for emergency situations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The locations of the remaining cameras targeted were not provided. The hacking would have provided access to a “snapshot” of the cameras’ images, it is said.Other attempts were made that were designed to gather sensitive information on shipments, such as train schedules and shipping manifests, it is claimed. “In at least one instance, the actors attempted to use voice phishing to gain access to privileged accounts by impersonating IT staff,” says the advisory from 10 countries including the US, France and Germany.It adds: “The subjects of spearphishing emails were diverse and ranged from professional topics to adult themes. Phishing emails were frequently sent via compromised accounts or free webmail accounts. The emails were typically written in the target’s native language and sent to a single targeted recipient.”Paul Chichester, the NCSC’s director of operations, said: “This malicious campaign by Russia’s military intelligence service presents a serious risk to targeted organisations, including those involved in the delivery of assistance to Ukraine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The contest was ultimatelywon by Austria’s JJ with Wasted Love.Finland’s Yle Entertainment said: “We will ask the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) whether it is time to update these rules or at least review whether the current rules allow for abuse.” Spain’s public broadcaster called for a “complete review” to avoid “external interference”.Ireland’s RTÉ has requested a breakdown of the numbers, and the Netherlands and Iceland are also among those to have raised issues. Director of the competition, Martin Green, said it is taking the concerns “seriously”.Yuval Raphael performs New Day Will Rise in Basel during Saturday’s Eurovision song contest.Israel’s song, New Day Will Rise, submitted by the Israeli public service broadcaster Kan,comprehensively wonthe public part of the vote, after scoring points from 34 of the 38 national and international phone votes. Its performer, Yuval Raphael, was a survivor of the terror assault on the Nova musical festival.The previous Israeli entry finished second in the public vote, earning fifth place in the 2024 contest. Kan had previously beenforced to change the lyricsof entry October Rain, which was deemed to directly reference the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack inside Israel. Performer Eden Golan instead sung the retitled Hurricane.Public Spotify and YouTube streaming data shows that Raphael’s track lags far behind other competitors in terms of popularity. New Day Will Rise wasthe 19th most popular songfrom this year’s competition on Spotify in the week of the event, yet scored the maximumdouze pointsfrom 13 national public votes.Israeli government social media channelshave been encouraging people to vote for its representative the maximum 20 times permitted.

This is not currently against Eurovision’s rules.Belgium’s broadcaster VRT provided data to community news site Songfestival.be which alsoappeared to showa disparity between numbers of viewers and voters. Their statistics indicated that the number of votes cast from Belgium had increased from 1.3m in 2023, to 2m in 2024 and then 2.2m in 2025. However, the show had only about half as many viewers in 2025 as in 2023, as Belgium did not make the final.Dutch broadcaster AvroTros issued a statement this week saying that it attaches “great importance to the apolitical and binding value of the Eurovision song contest” but that it is “increasingly influenced by social and geopolitical pressures”.The results have delighted some quarters. The Jewish Chronicledescribed the 2025 resultas a “rebuff” to anti-Israeli activists and media pundits, writing that “Eurovision fans ignored the relentless campaigning against the Jewish state”.Ewan Spence, senior editor atESC Insight, which reports on Eurovision all year round, told the Guardian that there are potential issues with any future Israeli victory while the Gaza conflict continues. “If Kan wins the Eurovision song contest under the Israeli flag, it would be expected to host the following year, which would raise significant security challenges.“If the contest had to be hosted elsewhere in partnership, the reputation of Eurovision inside Israel would be damaged, and the co-host broadcaster taking on that challenge would face reputational PR issues.”German broadcaster ARD would most likely be the first port of call for the EBU approaching someone to co-host alongside Israel, the way the UK co-hosted on behalf of Ukraine in Liverpool in 2023. However, Benjamin Netanyahu’s administration, which has beenseeking to privatise Kan, would almost certainly apply pressure for the contest to take place in Israel itself. Broadcasters would be under pressure to boycott a contest hosted or co-hosted by Israel while the conflict in Gaza continued.View image in fullscreenPro-Palestinian demonstrators attend a protest, on the day of the Eurovision song contest final in Basel.Photograph: Christian Hartmann/ReutersSome in the Eurovision community believe the contest has been affected by changes made by the EBU to accommodate Israel’s participation. The volume of the crowd in the arena appears to be mixed lower now, to prevent TV broadcasting boos for Israeli acts or pro-Palestinian slogans, and stricter rules were brought in on fans having flags inside the arena. There wasa security incident during Raphael’s performancethat led to a Eurovision staff member being hit with paint, and on the day of the contest pro-Palestinian demonstrators clashed with police in the centre of host city Basel.Spence said: “If Kan had won Eurovision on Saturday, the song contest would have faced an increased loss of engagement from community media and the wider fanbase.”Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez explicitly called on Israel to be expelled from Eurovision on Monday, directly comparing the situation with that of Russia’s exclusion from international events, saying: “[Russia] had to leave international competitions and could not take part … Therefore Israel shouldn’t either, because what we cannot allow is double standards in culture.”The EBU has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionEuropeTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Pentagon officials have acknowledged that the jet is not yet suitable for presidential use without significant upgrades.Members of Congress havevoiced concernsthat the air force may be pressured to rush the process, potentially compromising critical safety features.Lawmakers from both parties havealso questionedQatar’s motives, suggesting the gift could be an attempt to gain influence or that the plane might contain hidden surveillance devices.Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator for Connecticut, previouslycondemned the giftin the context of the president’s trip to the Middle East last week.“Why did he choose these three countries for his first major foreign trip? It’s not because these are our most important allies or the most important countries in the world,” he said of Trump’s visit to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.“It’s because these are the three countries willing to pay him off. Every single one of these countries is giving Trump money – the plane from Qatar, an investment in his cryptocurrency scam from the UAE – and they are asking for national security concessions in return.”Murphy added: “This is the definition of corruption. Foreign governments putting money in the president’s pocket and then the US giving them national security concessions that hurt our own security.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is greater than the combined total for 2020-23, according to Campaign against the Arms Trade.Challenged on these figures by the independent Labour MP Zarah Sultana in the Commons on Tuesday, the foreign secretary,David Lammy, said he did not recognise the number and accused her of sensationalising the issue. He assured MPs “arms are not getting to Israel that could be used in Gaza”.However, the latest figures show the government authorised more than £61m in single-issue licences for military goods with an end user in Israel. This included licences for goods categories covering targeting systems, munitions and military aircraft parts.In his letter, Byrne points out that ministers assured MPs that the ban covered “equipment that we assess is for use in the current conflict in Gaza, such as important components that go into military aircraft, including fighter aircraft, helicopters and drones, as well as items that facilitate ground targeting”.He asks for an explanation for the increase and the proportion of arms going to the Israeli state.In addition, he has asked for the release of statistics on the number of licences that have been changed to remove Israel as the end user.The high court last week conducted a four-day judicial review of the UK government’s claim that it was lawful for the UK to sell components for F-35 fighter jets indirectly to Israel even though there was an acknowledged ministerial acceptance that those parts could be transferred for use in planes to bomb Gaza.Meanwhile, Labour MPs and human rights groups welcomed Lammy’s hardening in tone concerning the blockade of aid into Gaza on Tuesday, but almost every Labour backbencher who spoke during the 90-minute session expressed anger that ministers had only suspended talks on an expanded free trade deal with Israel, and hinted at further unspecified concrete measures.Explore more on these topicsArms tradeForeign policyIsraelDavid LammyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

According to local officials, an attacker drove a vehicle into the bus and then detonated explosives.Officials said five people – three children, the bus driver and a security guard – were killed and dozens more children were critically injured. Police said the initial investigation indicated that it was a suicide bombing.The children killed were named as 12-year-old Hifsa Kausar, 16-year-old Esha Saleem and 12-year-old Sania Somroo.‘He only wanted revenge’: the bloody insurgency in Balochistan gaining lethal momentumRead moreNo militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. However, the media wing of Pakistan’s military swiftly issued a statement alleging that its neighbour and rivalIndiahad “planned and orchestrated” the attack.“Indian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians,” the military statement said.India’s foreign ministry denied what it called “baseless allegations regarding Indian involvement in unrest in Pakistan”.The accusation comes at a highly volatile moment in India-Pakistan relations. Earlier this month, the two nuclear-armed countries came the closest they had been to war in decades as they launched drones and missiles into each other’s territory, before a ceasefire was declared on 10 May.The trigger for the conflict was a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in April that killed 26 people. The Indian government accused Pakistan-backed militant groups of being behind the incident and launched targeted missile strikes as “terrorist infrastructure and camps” over the border. Pakistan responded by firing missiles at Indian military targets.In the aftermath of the ceasefire, the Indian government said any future terror attacks on its territory would be considered an act of war.Pakistan has denied any involvement in last month’s militant attack in Indian Kashmir. It has become more vocal in blaming India for a rising wave of militant attacks that have struck Pakistan, particularly in the regions of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Pakistan has repeatedly accused India of using proxy militant groups to carry out terror attacks in order to destabilise the country, which India has denied.In Balochistan, home to a decades-long bloody insurgency, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist militant group, has been behind a growing number of incidents including suicide bombings and the recent hijacking of a train. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which borders Afghanistan, attacks by the Pakistani Taliban, known as TTP, have been intensifying recently.Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, echoed the military in blaming India for Wednesday’s attack on the school bus. “Terrorists operating under Indian patronage attacking innocent children on a school bus is clear evidence of their hostility,” he said.A Balochistan government spokesperson, Shahid Rind, denounced the attack as the “hideous face of Indian state-sponsored terrorism”.The attack echoed an incident more than a decade earlier when the TTP struck an army public school in the city of Peshawar, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing more than 130 schoolchildren. It was one of the deadliest militant attacks on children in Pakistan’s history.Explore more on these topicsPakistanIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

At least four, including Subedi, were immediately rejected by Bhutanese authorities and then expelled to India, where they fled to a refugee camp in Nepal.“I have nothing right now. They brought us in [to Bhutan] without any documents,” he says from one of the three Beldangi refugee camps in the south-east of Nepal, where he is using his father’s cellphone.Subedi had been serving jail time for a third-degree felony offense committed in Columbus, Ohio, before he was put on a plane and deported via New Jersey.Subedi is one of the more than 100,000 Bhutanese Nepalis who fledethnic cleansingand were made stateless by the Bhutanese government who stripped them of their citizenship rights in the 1980s. Since 2008, more than 90,000 have been resettled in the US.But theTrump administrationhas upended life for the community.Nepali-speaking Bhutanese refugees in limbo after deportation from USRead more“Bhutan is still not safe for our community members to return [to]. It is a matter of putting our lives at risk … Now, people are going through the cycle of being stateless again,” says Robin Gurung of Asian Refugees United.Several of the deported people are believed to be missing in India.Icetold Global Press Journalthat Subedi was deported under a “targeted enforcement operation”. Green card holders – Subedi is a legal permanent resident – can be deported having been found guilty of a serious crime but only after having the opportunity to plead their case in court and once the US government has shown “clear and convincing evidence” that the person can be deported. US laws forbid the deportation of individuals to countries where their safety may be at risk.“Most of the folks who have been deported have already served their time. For me, that is the matter of concern,” says Gurung. “They served their time, they were in their communities, providing for their families, their children, and now they are gone.”Thousands of Bhutanese Nepalis have settled in parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania that faced major economic struggles and population loss due to the 2008 Great Recession. About 8,000 Bhutanese Nepali people now live in Reynoldsburg, a city outside Columbus, making up about one-fifth of the population.Along the suburb’s main thoroughfare, East Main Street, Bhutanese Americans have opened up more than 30 businesses ranging from hair salons to restaurants.“A lot of the community works at local Amazon and FedEx facilities. Those kinds of jobs were very attractive for folks, and the schools in Reynoldsburg are good,” says Bhuwan Pyakurel who came to Reynoldsburg in 2016 and has since becomeAmerica’s first-ever Nepali-Bhutanese elected official.“Many of those businesses were closed before we came here [and] we came and revived them. Cricket is a big thing for the Bhutanese community when it wasn’t known here in the past. Now the city is in the process of building a new cricket field.”While towns and cities across the Sun belt have grown significantly in recent years, northern states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and beyond have struggled to retain and attract residents.As a result, immigrants have played an important role in helping local economies grow, creating a tax base for city authorities and adding vibrancy to a region working to shed its Rust belt past. Nextdoor in Pennsylvania, about 40,000 Bhutanese Nepalis live in the cities of Harrisburg and Lancaster. Harrisburg has lost nearly half of its population since 1950, though in recent years that decline has been halted.But now a crippling fear has gripped immigrant communities across the country.Pyakurel, who was elected to Reynoldsburg’s city council in 2019 having lived in a refugee camp in Nepal for 18 years, says he now fields five to 10 phone calls a day from worried local Bhutanese Nepali residents, many asking for guidance.“People are wondering if they should apply for their citizenship or wait for three years, if they should renew certain documentation,” he says. Last month, the Palestinian green card holder and Columbia University student Mohsen Mahdawi was detained at a naturalization interview and deportation proceedings against him were enacted. On 30 April, Mahdawi wasreleased.“Nowadays, I carry my passport with me all the time,” says Pyakurel. “Even though I’m a [city council] representative here, I don’t look like a citizen to many Ice officers.”Subedi came to the US through a government refugee relocation program in July 2016 and had been living and working as a machine operator in Pennsylvania before his arrest in Columbus last July.Now 7,700 miles from home, he has little to do but sit all day in the refugee camp, where he lives in a bamboo-made hut – the very same camp he spent the first two years of his life and where his father still lives. The arrival of him and three others deported from the US caused a stir at the camp, which drew the attention of the Nepali police, who detained him for several weeks as his legal status was investigated.This month, his daughter turns three years old. He says his family has no money to assist him in the refugee camp in part because his wife stopped working when their child was born.He says he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to come back to the US.“I want to come back. I have family, my kids,” Subedi says.“This is the second time we have become a refugee.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationBhutanNepalSouth and central AsiaTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) limit invasive sexual thoughts. Anti-androgens reduce the production of testosterone and limit libido.The drugs are taken alongside psychiatric work that targets other causes of sexual offending, such as a desire for power and control.Mahmood is exploring whether chemical castration could be made mandatory, instead of voluntary, for the most serious offenders, the source said.Sexual offences accounted for 21% of adults serving immediate custodial sentences at the end of March 2025. The report notes that participation in any such programme would be voluntary in England and Wales.Among the main recommendations, Gauke, the former Conservative justice secretary, said the government should:Ensure custodial sentences under 12 months are only used in exceptional circumstances.Extend suspended sentences to up to three years and encourage greater use of deferred sentences for low-risk offenders.Give courts greater flexibility to use fines and ancillary orders like travel, driving and football bans.Allow probation officers to adjust the level of supervision based on risk and compliance with licence conditions.Expand specialist domestic abuse courts to improve support for victims.Expand tagging for all perpetrators of violence against women and girls.Improve training for practitioners and the judiciary on violence against women and girls.Change the statutory purposes of sentencing so judges and magistrates must consider protecting victims as much as they consider punishment and rehabilitation when passing sentences.Gauke has called for the need to increase funding and resources for the probation service, including expanding the availability of electronic monitoring equipment like tags, and warned that there will be a “public backlash” if money is not found.“If probation are left without additional resources then the risk is that we won’t make progress on rehabilitation and there will be a public backlash,” he said.The National Police Chiefs’ Council echoed Gauke’s calls for more resources.Chief constable Sacha Hatchett, national policing lead for criminal justice, said: “Out of prison should not mean out of control. If we are going to have fewer people in prison, we need to ensure that we collectively have the resources and powers to manage the risk offenders pose outside prison.“Adequate funding to support these measures must be reflected in the upcoming spending review, as well as investment in probation services and technology, including electronic monitoring.”Penal reform group the Howard League welcomed the recommendations.Andrea Coomber, the chief executive, said: “The ball is now in the government’s court. Solving the prison capacity crisis will require major intervention and, as the review recognises, this will only succeed if reform and investment deliver an effective and responsive probation service that works to cut crime in the community.”The Conservatives have condemned Gauke’s review. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, said: “By scrapping short prison sentences Starmer is effectively decriminalising crimes like burglary, theft and assault. This is a gift to criminals who will be free to offend with impunity.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

The sister trade associations have called for the government’s comprehensive spending review to dramatically increase public investment, including £500m for infrastructure, and to support itsTheatre for Every Childinitiative which aims to ensure all pupils attend a professional theatre production before leaving school.The organisations’ co-CEOs, Claire Walker and Hannah Essex, said: “Theatres are doing more with less – and the strain is showing. Rising costs, shrinking support and ageing infrastructure are putting the sector under unsustainable pressure. We are seeing world-class organisations forced to cut programmes, delay maintenance and scale back outreach. If we want to maintain the UK’s position as a global leader in theatre – and continue to inspire the next generation of actors, writers, and technicians – then government must act.”The report, drawing on information from theatres that are members of the two organisations, states that one in five venues “require at least £5m over the next decade simply to remain operational”. Without substantial capital funding, nearly 40% “could close or become unusable”. Roughly one in four organisations ran a deficit in 2023–24, and almost one-third project a shortfall in the subsequent financial year.Since 2010, funding from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has fallen by 18% per person in real terms, notes the report, while local authority support has declined by as much as 48%. “Years of decline in creative education and underinvestment in skills training have left theatres struggling to recruit and retain staff,” it adds, with almost half of theatre leaders saying that new hires lack the necessary skills, particularly in technical roles.Against this backdrop, and the challenges of the pandemic and cost of living crisis, the two organisations’ member theatres drew audiences in excess of 37 million in 2024. ItsWest Endvenues “surpassed 17.1 million attenders [akin to 2023 levels] and generated more than £1bn in revenue”. Data from 48 regional venues shows a 4% increase in occupancy between 2019 and 2024 yet also underlined what regular theatregoers around the UK will have noticed: the number of shows being programmed has, in many cases, dropped in the last five years as theatres prune their schedules amid financial challenges.Bemoaning news headlines about premium ticket prices, the report stated that across the UK most tickets were sold for £39.50 or less (with 19% priced under £20 outside London), while in the West End most were sold at £56 or less. Since 2019, the average West End ticket price has fallen by 5.3% in real terms.Research quoted by the report shows that for every £1 spent on a theatre ticket, “an additional £1.40 is spent in the local economy”, while every pound of public investment returns more than £11 to the Treasury. The report said that the West End’s 11% post-pandemic audience growth is unmatched in the UK’s entertainment sector and highlighted that, last year, “nearly one in four international visitors to London attended a West End show – a testament to its global appeal”.Explore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndArts fundingTicket pricesConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is often regarded as one of New Labour’s most successful social policies.The programme was dismantled by Conservative-led governments elected from 2010 onwards. At its peak in 2009-10 Sure Start had 3,600 centres in England, before austerity cuts reduced government funding by two-thirds, with local authoritiesscaling back or closing most of the centresby 2018.The IFS looked at children born in the 1990s and 2000s who took part, and found it improved health and educational outcomes, including better than expected GCSE results, as well as reducing school absences and less severe special educational needs and disabilities.Nick Ridpath, a research economist at the IFS and an author of the report, said: “These benefits are not only important in their own right, they also generate savings to the public purse and boost lifetime earnings. Sure Start did not quite pay for itself from the government’s perspective. But taking benefits for lifetime earnings into account, in the long run it will generate around twice as much value as it cost.”At its peak, Sure Start’s running costs were about £2.7bn a year in 2023–24 prices. The IFS calculated that the government benefited from savings of £600m each year in lower health, special needs and social care demands, and £1.9bn in extra income tax and national insurance revenue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Clearly, then, investing in quality integrated early years services is not just the right moral decision, but a smart economic choice too.”The researchers warned that Sure Start was not a “silver bullet”, with the programme “unable to address all challenges that children and young people face”. It noted that it had no significant effect on the number of children spending time in council care and didn’t reduce support for more serious special needs provision.Explore more on these topicsEarly years educationInstitute for Fiscal StudiesChildren's healthSpecial educational needsChildrenEnglandThinktanksnewsShareReuse this content"

This is because very dense breasts look whiter on scans, making it harder to detect early-stage disease, which also appears white.Offering this group of women enhanced scans could find 3,500 more cases of cancer and save 700 lives a year in the UK, researchers from the University of Cambridge said. Their findings werepublished in the Lancet.Drug that cuts risk of breast cancer returning is approved for use in EnglandRead moreThe study’s lead author, Prof Fiona Gilbert, said: “Getting a cancer diagnosis early makes a huge difference for patients in terms of their treatment and outlook. We need to change our national screening programme so we can make sure more cancers are diagnosed early, giving many more women a much better chance of survival.”She added: “In addition to the relevance for the UK’s breast cancer screening programme, this study has global implications for all countries where screening is undertaken for women with dense breast tissue.”The study involved 9,361 women in the UK who had dense breasts and had received a negative (no cancer) mammogram result. When additional scanning methods were trialled, an extra 85 cancers were found.Two methods examined were contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM), in which dye is used to make blood vessels more visible, and abbreviated magnetic resonance imaging (Ab-MRI), which is faster than a regular MRI.View image in fullscreenExample mammogram images of healthy breasts showing fatty/least dense (left) and dense (right).Photograph: Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust/PAResearchers said adding either method to existing screening could detect 3,500 more cancers a year in the UK. With screening reducing mortality for about 20% of cancers detected, this could mean an extra 700 lives saved a year, the Cambridge team said.A third scanning method used in the trial – automated breast ultrasound (Abus) – also picked up cancers but was much less effective than CEM and Ab-MRI.CEM detected 19 cancers for every 1,000 women scanned, Ab-MRI found 17 and Abus found four. With mammograms already detecting about eight cases of cancer per 1,000 women with dense breasts, additional scans could more than treble breast cancer detection, the researchers said.The trial was funded byCancerResearch UK (CRUK) with support from the National Institute for Health and Care Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.Although the trial showed the scans could detect additional small cancers, which would probably save lives, further research is needed to confirm whether they could reduce the number of deaths, in order to establish the risk of overdiagnosis and to estimate the cost-benefit ratio of offering extra scans.“More research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness of these techniques, but these results are encouraging,” said Dr David Crosby, the head of prevention and early detection at CRUK.Dr Kotryna Temcinaite, the head of research communications and engagement at Breast Cancer Now, said: “The UK National Screening Committee now needs to consider this research as part of their current review to determine whether women with very dense breasts should be offered additional imaging during their routine screening.”She added: “Routine breast screening is the most likely route to finding breast cancer early, when treatment is most likely to be successful. While we know that the current process can be less effective in detecting cancers in dense breasts, we still encourage all women to attend mammogram screening when invited.”The Department forHealthand Social Care said research into enhanced scans for women with dense breasts was being carried out as part of the NHS breast screening programme. “The UK National Screening Committee is reviewing this evidence as it becomes available,” a spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsBreast cancerHealthWomen's healthNHSCancer researchCancerMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

An investigation was carried out, which led to the Crown Prosecution Service authorising the above charge.”Earlier this month, the Met said Kneecap was being investigated by counter-terrorism police after videos emerged allegedly showing the band calling for the deaths of MPs and shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”.The counter terrorism internet referral unit (CTIRU) is a national unit based within the Met’s counter-terrorism command, which is dedicated to identifying terrorist and extremist material online.Both Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.A Metropolitan police spokesperson said at the time: “We were made aware of a video on 22 April, believed to be from an event in November 2024, and it has been referred to the counter-terrorism internet referral unit for assessment and to determine whether any further police investigation may be required.“We have also been made aware of another video believed to be from an event in November 2023.”Kneecap said they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and apologised last month to the families of murdered MPs but claimed footage of the incident had been taken out of context and was being “exploited and weaponised”.A number of concerts featuring the band have been called off since the videos emerged.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, he was only able to experience his child’s birth via a telephone call.Khalil, a legal permanent resident, or US green-card holder, was arrested in New York on 8 March in the first in a string of Ice arrests targeting pro-Palestinian students and scholars, and put in detention without due process.Ina letter to his son published in the Guardian, Khalil wrote shortly after the birth: “My heart aches that I could not hold you in my arms and hear your first cry, that I could not unfurl your clenched fists or change your first diaper.”“My absence is not unique,” he continued. “Like other Palestinian fathers, I was separated from you by racist regimes and distant prisons.

Irwin, a pet kangaroo, first jumped throughDurango as a babyin October 2024. On Monday, he showed that his escapist tendencies have followed him from the pouch to adolescence.Irwin (named after Steve Irwin) was first caught in October when officers lured him with a large bag, banking on its similarity to a kangaroo pouch. But, when it came to catching a more grown-up Irwin, local police officers had to come up with a different kanga-ruse, a new form of hop pursuit.Released footage shows an officer approaching Irwin in a narrow corridor between a red fence and a brick house. Irwin attempts to jump past the officer (described by Durango’s police chiefas “a big farm boy”), and lands in his arms instead. “We have the kangaroo detained,” another officer calls into dispatch.Irwin’s confusion over his locale is understandable.

And while farmers welcome news that the US and Chinese officials agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs placed on exports, plenty of uncertainty remains.China is one of the top three importers of US food commodities, behind Canada and Mexico, and the escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing has worried farmers - particularly grain farmers, wholost money on last year’s harvestas bumper crops weighed on prices.Even as farmers plant this year’s corn and soya bean crops, agricultural economists estimate grain farmers could lose money again as total production costs remain above current prices, unless something changes.In a 90-day truce announced on 12 May, the US will cut the additional tariffs it placed on Chinese imports to 30%, down from 145%, while Chinese levies on US imports will drop to 10%. Over the next three months, the two countries will continue negotiations.Soya bean farmers have much to gain – or lose – in Chinese trade talks. Last year 54% of US soya bean exports went to China, according to the American Soybean Association.Soya beans were a casualty of Donald Trump’s trade war with China during his first term in 2016. Between 2000 to 2016, the US’s share of Chinese soya bean imports averaged around 40%, but by 2018 but it fell sharply as China turned to Brazil for its oilseed needs, said Lane Akre, economist at Farm Journal, a trade publication.Although the US and China eventually formalized trade for a few years, the US’s market share of Chinese purchases never rebounded. Last year it was only 22%, Akre said.Caleb Ragland, the soya bean association’s president and a soya bean producer in Kentucky, and Brian Duncan, president of Illinois Farm Bureau, who also runs a grain and livestock farm in north-west Illinois, both said they’re happy to see a truce, but the 90-day pause is not a long-term solution.“We understand the importance of fair trade, but we’ve historically supported a rules-based approach to trade. We’re hopeful that the negotiations here can lead to a productive framework,” Duncan said.Duncan said the investments farmers make in their operations, such as machinery, land, livestock and crops, are costs that often are paid for over years, costs that can’t be passed on. That makes trade uncertainty so difficult to manage.“We’re price takers, not price makers. So it’s unnerving here, as we’re planting this crop, wondering what demand is going to be, and realizing that during the last round of trade disputes with China, it pushed them further into the arms of Brazil,” he said.China is also an important export market for US pork, as 55% of pork offal products not readily consumed domestically, such as snouts and feet, go to China, in addition to muscle cuts, according to the National Pork Producers Council.Karl Setzer, partner with Consus Ag Consulting, a grain merchandising consultant, said farmer sentiment surveys, such as those taken monthly byPurdue University, show farmers are optimistic and think tariffs will be beneficial in the long run. He said some of that optimism may reflect the fact that farmers received subsidies from the Trump administration during the last trade war. Setzer wasn’t sure the optimism on tariffs is warranted in the long run.Despite the China rows, both Setzer and Akre said the US has other export markets to sell its grain and oilseeds but inking a deal with China matters.What’s potentially concerning is that the truce will end in 90 days, just before farmers begin the fall harvest.The truce comes at a lull in crop marketing, as much of last year’s harvest has been sold, and farmers haven’t forward-booked sales for the new crop that will be harvested in the fall. That makes it hard to tell the impact of the truce, said Setzer.“We don’t know what it means for new crop yet. Demand doesn’t really start to increase until we get to June or July,” he said.Explore more on these topicsFarmingTrump tariffsTariffsUS economyShareReuse this content"

It has support from Democrats and Republicans, so we should pass it, well, as soon as possible, without any poison pills,” said Rosen, a Democrat, on theSenate floor.The bill was introduced in the Senate in January 2025 by Senator Ted Cruz and a bipartisan group of co-sponsors which included Rosen and the Nevada senator Catherine Cortez Masto.No objections were made by Rosen’s request, resulting in the passage of the bill, which now goes to the House.The bipartisanbillwill create a tax deduction of up to $25,000 for cash tips reported to employers by workers for withholding purposes on payroll taxes, with a cap on the salary for eligible workers at $160,000 annually.The bill calls for the US Department of Treasury to issue a list of occupations that traditionally receive tips within 90 days of the bill’s enactment.Ending taxes on tips gained traction during the 2024 presidential election, with Donald Trumptoutingthe plan on the campaign trail in Nevada, and Kamala Harris laterendorsingthe idea.No tax on tips fires up Nevada hospitality workers: ‘I want that!’Read moreEconomistsand labor advocates havecriticizedthe legislation, withconcernsit will incentivize the expansion of tipped work, undermine pay increases and would affect only a small segment of about 5% of low-paid workers who receive tips.According to Brookings Institute researchers,37%of all tipped workers already pay no federal income tax because their earnings are so little, and eliminating sub-minimum wages for tipped workers would be more impactful.“Without having these earnings floors in place, the minimum wage floor and calling for an increase, workers are vulnerable to exploitation and inequality in the labor market which is harmful overall for the economy,” Lena Simet, a senior researcher Human Rights Watch,toldthe Guardian in August 2024 on the push to end taxes on tips.“It doesn’t mean that workers can no longer be tipped.

The company scaled back many diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in January after they came under attack by conservative activists and the White House. Target’s retreat created another backlash, with morecustomers angeredby the retailer’s reduction of LGBTQ+-themed merchandise for Pride month in June of 2023.‘Hit them where it hurts’: Americans boycott corporations to protest anti-DEI policiesRead moreSales fell 2.8% to $23.85bn in the quarter, and that was short of the $24.23bn Wall Street expected, according to FactSet. Sales are also down from the $24.53bn the company reported during the same period last year.Target cut its annual sales projections on Wednesday. The company now expects a low-single digit decline for 2025 after projecting a 1% increase for sales in March.Comparable store sales, those from established stores and online channels, fell 3.8%. That includes a 5.7% drop in store sales and a 4.7% increase in online sales. That reverses a comparable store sales increase of 1.5% in the previous quarter.The number of transactions across online and physical stores fell 2.4%, and the average ticket dropped 1.4%. Target said on Tuesday that it could not reliably estimate the individual impact of each of the factors that were hurting its business.The latest results underscore Target’s ongoing struggle in recent years to revive sales particularly in nonessentials like fashion and home furnishings as competition grows more fierce with the likes of Walmart and Amazon. Target’s shares have fallen more than 37% in the past 52 weeks.Target rival Walmart reported strong quarterly sales last week. The nation’s largest retailer said it had alreadyraised priceson some items due to tariffs and that more price hikes were on the way this summer when the back-to-school shopping season goes into high gear. For example, car seats made in China that currently sell for $350 at Walmart will probably cost customers another $100, executives said.Target did not offer specifics on tariffs’ impact on prices, but said that it was looking at different ways to offset those costs.Which Trump tariffs are active, which are paused and what’s next?Read more“We look at competition,” Cornell told reporters. “We make adjustments literally each and every week, so we’re constantly adjusting pricing.

But there’s an easy fix for our debtRobert ReichInstead of cutting taxes on the richest Americans – who hold much of the country’s debt – simply raise themWed 21 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 21 May 2025 09.52 EDTShareOn Friday, thecredit rating of the United States was downgraded. Moody’s, the ratings firm, announced that the government’s rising debt levels would grow further if theTrumpRepublican package of new tax cuts were enacted. This makes lending to the US riskier.Moody’s is the third of the three major credit-rating agencies to downgrade the credit rating of the United States.So-called “bond vigilantes” have already been selling the US government’s debt, as the Republican tax package moves through Congress. They’re expected to sell even more, driving long-term interest rates even higher to make up for the growing risk of holding US debt.Some rightwingRepublicansin Congress are using the Moody’s downgrade to justify deeper spending cuts in Medicaid, food stamps and other social programs that lower-income Americans depend on.But, hello? There’s a far easier way to reduce the federal debt. Just end the Trump tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy and big corporations – and insteadraisetaxes on them.I’m old enough to remember when the US’s super-rich financed the government with their tax payments. Under Dwight Eisenhower – hardly a leftwing radical – the highest marginal tax rate was 91%. (Even after all tax credits and deductions were figured in, the super-rich paid way over half their top marginal incomes in taxes.)But since the Reagan, George W Bush and Trump 1 tax cuts, tax rates on the super-rich have plummeted.So instead of financing the government with their taxes, the super-rich have been financing the US government bylending it money.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Robert ReichFree newsletterGet Robert Reich’s latest columns delivered straight to your inboxEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wrong.More than 70%of it is held byAmericans– and most of them are wealthy.)This means that an ever-increasing portion of the taxes from therestof us are dedicated to paying ever-increasing interest payments on the debt – payments that go largely to the super-rich.So when the debt of the United States is downgraded because Trump Republicans are planning another big tax cut mainly benefiting the rich and big corporations, most Americans could end up paying in three different ways:They’ll pay evenmoreinterest on the growing debt – to the super-rich.They’ll pay higher interest rates on all other long-term debt. (As higher rates on treasury bonds waft through the economy, they raise borrowing costs on everything from mortgages to auto loans.)The debt crisis will give Republicans even more excuse to do what they’re always wanting to do: slash safety nets. So many Americans could lose benefits they rely on, such asMedicaidand food stamps.The “bond vigilantes” are not the cause of this absurdity. Neither is Moody’s or the other credit-rating agencies. Nor, for that matter, is the growing national debt.What’s the underlying cause? Just follow the money. It’s the growing political power of the super-rich and big corporations to lower their taxes at the expense of most Americans.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

It said it aimed to halve the financial impact of the attack to about £150m through insurance, cost reductions and other actions.Machin said the hack was not down to a weakness in M&S’s IT systems and access had been gained via a third party. That contractor is understood to be Tata Consulting Services (TCS), which manages M&S’s helpdesk among other IT services. Two employee logins were used as part of the breach, according to a Reuters report, for which TCS declined to comment.Machin said he expected the business to “recover at pace” from the disruption, with its website expected to reopen “within the next few weeks” and probably to begin selling in all product categories before July.“If anything, the incident allows us to accelerate the pace of change as we draw a line and move on,” he said.He dismissed fears of a hit to shoppers’ confidence in the business, saying the retailer had been “very transparent” about the problem and had passed on information swiftly.Machin said M&S’s food was now selling well but that clothing and homeware sales in stores were “softer than we would like”, having been disrupted by the closure of the website.He acknowledged that £300m – about two-thirds of which is down to lost clothing sales, according to analysts – “does sound like a big number” but he described the hit as a “one-off” that was “not significant” to the business as a whole.Machin said there were no plans to offset the cost with job cuts or to reduce store refurbishments or openings, which include nine new food stores and two full-line outlets planned this year.The business is bringing forward IT investment and will carry out two years of work on updating its systems in six months, partly aided by the forced shutdown of its website and online distribution centre, which made bringing in new technology simpler.Analysts said they expected to cut profit forecasts for this year by at least 10%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The attack forced M&S tostop ordersvia its website, through which it sells fashion, homeware and gifts, while deliveries of food and fashion into stores and some deliveries to its online food partner, Ocado, have also been disrupted.M&S has admitted that some personal informationrelating to thousands of customers– including names, addresses, dates of birth and order histories – was taken in the cyber-attack.Machin thanked customers and staff for their support. He said the business was now “focused on recovery, with the aim of exiting this period a much stronger business”.“We started the new financial year as we finished the last, with sales growth ahead of budget across both businesses,” he said.The figures showed that the cyber-incident interrupted a strong period of trading for M&S. Overall sales were up by 6% to £13.9bn over the year to 30 March. Food sales rose by almost 9% to £9bn, while fashion and homeware increased by 3.5% to £4.2bn.The company did not give a figure for how much sales had fallen since the attack.After including one-off costs such as a £248.5m write-down on the valuation of its Ocado Retail joint venture and £84m in costs of shutting and refurbishing stores, the company’s pre-tax profits fell by 24% to £511.8m.The attack, which has been attributed to the hacking collectiveScattered Spider, emerged days before similar cyber-attacks were reported againstthe Co-opandHarrods.Explore more on these topicsMarks & SpencerRetail industryAnnual resultsCybercrimeHackingnewsShareReuse this content"

It was not about what happens next with the manager; that can wait. It was about grasping an opportunity that does not come around very often, about emerging from what has felt like a generation’s worth of jibes; about winning.On a golden night for their longsuffering followers, they chased the baggage from their backs, they changed the narrative. Yet again, Postecoglou won in his second season at a club. For the first time since 2008, Spurs got their hands on a trophy.Ange Postecoglou keen to continue at Tottenham after Europa League winRead moreThere was an idea that success here could do more than rescue the season and bring Champions League qualification; it could unlock something. Yet in the release of all that pent-up frustration upon the full-time whistle, all that mattered was these 90 minutes – plus those nerve-shredding seven extra ones – inside this stadium.It was a long way from being a classic but try telling that to the hordes in white who danced and pulled each other tight when it was all over, lost in the emotion. Spurs scored just before the interval when Brennan Johnson attacked a Pape Sarr cross, the ball spinning home – just about – with assistance from the unfortunateManchester Uniteddefender, Luke Shaw. And thereafter, Postecoglou’s team simply defended. They did so with their lives. Their expected goals statistic for the second half? 0.00. It did not matter. The only thing that did was keeping United out.Cristian Romero, who started as the captain after Postecoglou named Son Heung-min among the substitutes, was a titan of strength, ably supported by his central defensive partner, Micky van de Ven. But there were heroes everywhere in white. Like Sarr, whose energy was remarkable in the No 10 role. Like Yves Bissouma.United had their openings, none bigger than when Rasmus Højlund looped a header goalwards in the 68th minute and saw Van de Ven take off towards his own line, stretching out one of those long legs to acrobatically hook clear from high above it; one of the defining images.View image in fullscreenTottenham’s Micky van de Ven acrobatically clears a Rasmus Højlund header off the line in the second half.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/ReutersPlenty of the others came after full time. Son’s tears; after 10 years at Spurs, he finally has what he has craved. Postecoglou’s broad smile. He has succeeded where Mauricio Pochettino, José Mourinho, Antonio Conte and all the rest failed. If he departs, after what has been a historically terrible Premier League season, he will do so as a legend.Spurs will arrange the open-top bus parade – it is slated for Friday – and, hey, their fans will probably tell you that they have now won more than Arsenal over the last five years.United fought until the end, Shaw working Guglielmo Vicario deep into stoppage time with a header but yet again, they paid the price for their lack of end product. Winning a trophy would not have papered over the cracks that have yawned wide during a truly awful domestic season but it would have given them a good feeling. They departed with only emptiness.The hype had been extraordinary: redemption or Armageddon. For both clubs. It felt as black and white as that. But if the line about Bilbao bobbins got a laugh, it overlooked how hard the teams had fought to get here; how much it meant.The nerves jangled; hearts hammered. On the pitch and in the stands. There were errors as both teams fought to settle; fouls conceded, clearances fluffed. It was end to end, the tempo lifted from a weekend Premier League fixture. Composure was sorely missing.View image in fullscreenBruno Fernandes struggled to make a decisive impact for Manchester United.Photograph: Vincent West/ReutersPostecoglou has shown that he can be more flexible with his approach in the knockout rounds of this competition. It need not be relentless waves of intricate attacks. Spurs were happy to look long for Dominic Solanke.

It was easy to fixate on Amad Diallo versus Destiny Udogie, with the Spurs left-back intent on taking risks, on driving upfield – and not without success. Diallo was booked for tugging at his shirt during the first half. In the other direction, Diallo shimmered with menace.Spurs blew the game open in the 42nd minute. There had been few clear chances up to that point. Sarr had a shot blocked after a loose Harry Maguire pass for Shaw, Johnson having got in on the initial phase while Diallo flashed in a couple of dangerous balls.Spurs prevail with Mourinho blueprint and ultra pragmatism in baffling final | Jonathan WilsonRead moreThe breakthrough was of a piece with the overall scrappiness. Sarr’s whipped cross from the left was dangerous, with Johnson making a trademark run from the far post. He could not finish on the bounce and that was when fate intervened, the ball rearing up, striking Shaw’s upper arm and squirming, via a brush with Johnson’s boot, into the corner beyond André Onana’s desperate dive.United had been here before this season; trailing Spurs, needing to find an answer. In both of the league fixtures and the Carabao Cup quarter-final, they could not do so, losing all three.Spurs sank deeper, measuring their progress in duels won, clearances executed. Udogie made a crucial tackle on Diallo inside the area before surging forward at the other end, narrowly missing a pass to Solanke. Son got on for Richarlison and Spurs dug even deeper, the Van de Ven clearance standing as a symbol. Vicario had spilled a Bruno Fernandes free-kick and Højlund was able to measure his header.Ruben Amorim made changes, including Alejandro Garnacho and Joshua Zirkzee for Mason Mount and Højlund. United probed. Fernandes blew a header when well placed and Garnacho extended Vicario. Postecoglou sent on Kevin Danso for Johnson and went to a back five. When Vicario denied Shaw, Spurs were there.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueTottenham HotspurManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Over four days, competitors will race, lift and swim with full access to drugs and therapies banned in virtually every other elite athletic setting.On your marks, get set, dope! Welcome to the Enhanced Games – the sporting event no one wants | Marina HydeRead moreBilled as a revolution in sport and science, the event aims to embrace what organizers call “superhumanity” – a future where pharmaceutical and technological enhancement is normalized in elite competition. But while promoters cast it as a bold break from the past, critics are already raising alarms about safety, fairness and the fundamental integrity of sport.“We are creating a new category of human excellence,” the Enhanced Games’ promotional materials declare. “A world where performance-enhancing drugs are used safely, openly, and under medical supervision.”The pitch is simple but radical: rather than penalize athletes for using banned substances, normalize and study their use in a medically supervised environment. Under the Enhanced model, athletes can either compete naturally, follow independent enhancement protocols, or participate in a clinical trial using FDA-approved drugs designated as “Investigational Medicinal Products”.The event’s founder, the London-based Australian entrepreneur Aron D’Souza, argues that current anti-doping policies are outdated and hypocritical. “The Enhanced Games is renovating the Olympic model for the 21st century,” he said. “In the era of accelerating technological and scientific change, the world needs a sporting event that embraces the future – particularly advances in medical science.”Organizers promise extensive medical screening, individualized health profiling and oversight by independent scientific and ethics boards. But athletes will not be subject to traditional anti-doping tests. Instead, they must disclose what substances they’re using – a model that some critics warn resembles “don’t ask, don’t tell” for doping in sport.The first Games will be held at Resorts World in Las Vegas and feature sprinting, swimming and weightlifting. Prize money is substantial: up to $500,000 per event, including a $1m bonus for breaking the 100m sprint or 50m freestyle world records.That may not be a theoretical reward. In February, Greek-Bulgarian swimmer Kristian Gkolomeev recorded a time of 20.89sec in the 50m freestyle – 0.02sec faster than the official world record,which has stood since 2009– reportedly while following an enhancement protocol for the first time. The swim, held at a certified pool under Olympic-level oversight, was filmed for a forthcoming promotional documentary.Yet even this demonstration comes with caveats. Gkolomeev wore a full-body polyurethane suit not approved by Fina, swimming’s international governing body. Organizers claim the suit was commercially available and not decisive in the performance – but its inclusion underscores the ethical gray areas the Enhanced Games are poised to explore.More fundamentally, many observers are uneasy with the concept itself.View image in fullscreenAron D’Souza, founder and president of Enhanced Games. photographed at Paviline Kensington, London.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer“As we have seen through history, performance-enhancing drugs have taken a terrible physical and mental toll on many athletes. Some have died,” the World Anti-Doping Agency said in a statement. “Clearly this event would jeopardize [athletes’ health and well-being] by promoting the abuse of powerful substances and methods that should only be prescribed, if at all, for specific therapeutic needs.”Travis Tygart, CEO of the US Anti-Doping Agency, was even more blunt. “It’s a dangerous clown show, not real sport,” he said.‘Imagine if a 60-year-old broke Usain Bolt’s record’: the story behind the Enhanced Games, the Olympics where everyone dopesRead moreThe Enhanced Games are also attracting attention, and controversy, due to the event’s supporters. Thelatest funding round, reportedly in the millions, includes investment from 1789 Capital, a firm led by Donald Trump Jr, Omeed Malik and Chris Buskirk. Other co-leads include Apeiron Investment Group and Karatage, a hedge fund with stakes in cryptocurrency and AI ventures. Avideo announcing the fundingsuggests Donald Trump’s endorsement.D’Souza described the involvement of Trump-aligned investors as a natural fit. “I’ve had the great fortune of working alongside many members of the administration and other prominent figures of the Trump movement over the years,” he said in February. “To know that some of the most significant figures in American social and political life support the Enhanced Games is more important to us than any investment.”Peter Thiel, the tech billionaire known for his libertarian politics and backing of controversial biotech ventures, is also listed as a major investor and “close advisor”, according to D’Souza.The participation of such figures has drawn further scrutiny from critics who view the Enhanced Games as not only a break from the Olympic model, but a calculated provocation – a challenge to elite sporting institutions, anti-doping agencies and what D’Souza has called the “anti-science” bent of legacy sports governance.Organizers maintain they are not trying to overwrite Olympic records or discredit traditional sport. Instead, they frame the Enhanced Games as a parallel category, akin to the professionalization of sport in the 20th century. The goal, they argue, is to explore the boundaries of human potential while provoking a broader cultural conversation.It’s an ambitious vision – and a high-stakes gamble.Athletes from around the world are being recruited, including some who felt alienated by anti-doping regimes. Former swimming world champion James Magnussen is among them, though the Australian’s recent enhanced attempts fell short of record times.The organizers, now headquartered in New York, say they will not tolerate abuse of illicit substances. Drugs must be legally prescribed and athletes must be medically fit to compete. Still, enforcement appears to rely more on partnership than oversight – a feature, not a bug, according to the Enhanced team.“There are always risks in elite sport,” reads one of the Games’ internal FAQs. “We believe the greater risk is pretending those risks don’t exist.”Whether the public buys into that logic remains to be seen. Organizers say they are in talks with major sponsors and streaming platforms, but have not confirmed any broadcast partners or marquee athletes beyond a handful of early adopters. If backlash builds – from federations, governments or regulators – it’s unclear whether the model will survive its first test.For now, though, the Enhanced Games are moving ahead, armed with a defiant slogan: Live Enhanced.Whether the world embraces that vision or recoils from it may determine not just the future of one event, but the ethical limits of sport itself.Explore more on these topicsDrugs in sportUS sportsDonald Trump JrPeter ThielSwimmingAthleticsWeightliftingnewsShareReuse this content"

The team have used the play since 2022. It involves two or three players lining up behind quarterback Jalen Hurts to push him forward in short yardage situations. Several other teams have copied Philadelphia’s use of the play, including the Buffalo Bills. Pushing Josh Allen in short-yardage situations has worked out for Buffalo, except on a critical fourth down in the AFC championship game against Kansas City when there was also a controversial spot on the play.The Fall of Favre: the making – and unmaking – of a flawed NFL gunslingerRead moreThe Eagles brought former center Jason Kelce, one of the players who fueled the success of the tush push, to the meetings in Minnesota with owner Jeffrey Lurie to provide more clarity around the play. Kelce, a seven-time Pro Bowl pick who retired after the 2023 season, said recently he wasn’t as concerned about a ban of the tush push as he was about clearing up misconceptions it poses an injury risk and was partially responsible for his decision to end his career.“I’ll come out of retirement today if you tell me all I’ve got to do is run 80 tush pushes to play in theNFL,” Kelce said on the New Heights podcast with his brother, Travis. “I’ll do that gladly. It’ll be the easiest job in the world.”The NFL has said no injuries have been reported on a tush push since its inception. In April, NFL Competition Committee chairman Rich McKay stressed the issues surrounding the play extend beyond safety.“There are definitely some people that have health and safety concerns, but there’s just as many people that have football concerns,” McKay said. “So I wouldn’t say it was because of one particular health and safety video or discussion. It was much more about the play, the aesthetics of the play, is it part of what football has been traditionally, or is it more of a rugby play? All those types of discussions. Health and safety is still there because of potential but I wouldn’t go beyond that.”Packers president and CEO Mark Murphy called the tush push “bad for the game” after the Packers were eliminated by the Eagles in the playoffs last season.“There is no skill involved and it is almost an automatic first down on plays of a yard or less,” Murphy said. “I would like to see the league prohibit pushing or aiding the run.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I definitely will be one of the guys voting against it.”After Wednesday’s vote was taken, the Eagles sent on social media a picture of Hurts about to run a tush push against the Green Bay Packers with the caption, “Push on.” The Packers proposed the ban on offensive players pushing, pulling, lifting, grasping or encircling a runner.Explore more on these topicsNFLPhiladelphia EaglesUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

A lot of people don’t know what football players have to go through and play with. I’ve had a lot of ankle pain and played with it in the last couple of months.“It’s been a frustrating season. I’ve had a lot of things going on off the pitch mentally. Sometimes there’s things in life bigger than football. This season I’ve struggled a little bit. Hopefully come next year I can get my head mentally right, get back where I left the season before because I know what I’m capable of doing and the quality I have.”Foden has been supported by City. “Definitely,” he said. “The club has been so supportive. I can’t thank them enough. I know if everything was OK [off the pitch] I’d definitely be better on the field. Sometimes things happen and you have to deal with it and move on. Now it’s about improving and getting back to my best. I know my standards and what I can reach.”City fly to the US on 12 June for the Fifa Club World Cup. Foden was asked whether he would prefer a break.“It’s obviously difficult because the lads are mentally drained from this season,” he said. “I believe everyone needs the right time to recover. There will be this competition. It’s going to be a funny one: some clubs will take it more seriously than others but I know we’ll definitely take it seriously.“It’s going to be something new, I don’t know much about it; I’ve left it in the back of my head until the season’s finished.

A contract worth £150,000 a week has been put forward. Talks with several other clubs are anticipated and it is understood that Chelsea and Newcastle have been wooing the 22-year-old behind closed doors.Chelsea determined to keep Enzo Fernández despite Real Madrid interestRead moreNewcastle are looking to add more depth to a small squad and are understood to have made it clear that they feel that Delap can play in tandem with their star forward, Alexander Isak. Eddie Howe will also need a quality alternative to Isak – who is reportedly set to undergo groin surgery at the end of the season – if Newcastle seal qualification for the Champions League this weekend.Delap has enjoyed a breakout campaign since leaving Manchester City last summer, scoring 12 goals in 39 appearances, and represents an affordable option for any club looking to sign a striker this summer. There is no chance of him staying at Ipswich, who had looked into renegotiating the terms of his departure at one stage but are now resigned to him leaving. A deal within weeks would allow all sides clarity well before pre-season. At least one interested club have seen their hopes of signing Delap dashed after being made aware that he wants to play at the highest possible level.Chelsea have a policy of signing young players and like the England Under-21 international. They have alternatives and it has been suggested they will prioritise a move for the RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko if they qualify for the Champions League.Sesko has interest from elsewhere, including Arsenal, but has been tracked by Chelsea for three years. The 21-year-old Slovenia international has scored 26 goals for club and country this season.Delap is well known to United’s technical director, Jason Wilcox, from their time at City. United are also pushing to seal the signing of the Wolves forward Matheus Cunha and have considered Eintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitike, Napoli’s Victor Osimhen and Sporting’s Viktor Gyökeres.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowIpswich TownChelseaNewcastle UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

His arrest came after the NCA seized an estimated £600,000 of the class B drug as it was being smuggled through Stansted on 2 September.Border Force officers detected roughly 60kg (132lb) of the drug in two suitcases, which had arrived via a flight from Bangkok. Co-defendants Rosie Rowland and Yasmin Piotrowska, who both denied the charge, face no further action after prosecutors offered no evidence in their case.Prosecutor David Josse KC said that “at all material times they maintained both before the events that led to the importation and after the events they said they thought they were importing gold not cannabis”.Judge Christopher Morgan directed that not guilty verdicts be recorded in the case of Rowland and Piotrowska and they walked free from the dock.

It will replace the existing memorial that is located on the wall of the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand.Bruce Grobbelaar, Liverpool’s goalkeeper in 1985, attended the announcement at Anfield on Wednesday and admitted emotions are still raw. “One, because I was there,” he said. “Two, because my mother came from Africa with her husband. It was the first time she’d watched me play. She turned around to me afterwards and said: ‘If this is football, I don’t want to be a part of it.’ It left a lasting impression in my psyche. I had to live with that for all this time. She never watched me again. She came from Africa, she went back to Africa. She might have watched on TV, but never live.”The idea to mark the 40th anniversary with a new memorial came from Liverpool supporters. It was felt the current memorial is inadequate and, with the car park behind the Sir Kenny Dalglish stand occasionally closed to the public, the location unsuitable for people to pay their respects. The location of the new memorial, which will measure approximately 2.2m x 1m, has not been decided. Liverpool have identified five possible options around Anfield including one near the Hillsborough memorial.Liverpool consulted on the design with representatives of the Hillsborough families, supporters, Juventus and the president of the Association for the Families of Heysel Victims, Andrea Lorentini. Lorentini’s father, Roberto, was among those killed – aged 31 – when a wall collapsed at the stadium after a charge by Liverpool supporters.View image in fullscreenBruce Grobbelaar (right) attended the announcement of the new memorial at Anfield.Photograph: Courtesy of Liverpool FCJuventus will mark the anniversary on 29 May by unveiling a new memorial of their own near the Allianz Stadium. “Verso Altrove” is a 65m platform that spirals above ground and focuses on the horizon. The Liverpool great and club ambassador Ian Rush, who also played for Juventus, and the Liverpool chief executive, Billy Hogan, will attend the unveiling in Turin. Out of respect for Juventus’s commemorations next week Liverpool will not unveil their memorial until later in the summer. Juventus officials will attend the Anfield ceremony.The idea for two scarves tied together originated from photographs of the immediate aftermath of the disaster that showed fan memorabilia discarded all over the Heysel terraces. The image symbolises unity and solidarity between the two clubs, reconciliation and the bond formed by grief. A liver bird and a zebra, in the design of Liverpool’s and Juventus’s insignia from the mid-80s respectively, is on each scarf.Jonathan Bamber, Liverpool’s chief legal and external affairs officer, explained: “It’s something that we don’t want to forget. Forty years is a significant anniversary and so we felt it was a good moment to review what was already in place. We have a supporters’ board who we liaise with and it was supporters who came to the club and said: ‘Do you think that you should potentially look at this?’ There was the feeling that perhaps there could be something that was slightly more accessible and gave people the opportunity to reflect a bit more.“The interaction with Juventus and the families has been absolutely paramount, it’s been at the core of really everything that we’ve thought through. An awful lot of thought has gone into it, trying to get it right and make it meaningful.”Grobbelaar added: “I thank the club and Juventus and the people that have coordinated it for getting this right. Because the two clubs have to come together and they are bound together from that day onwards. They are for ever bound and I think it is a fantastic tribute to the passing of the 39.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolShareReuse this content"

The player’s name was redacted from the published written findings of an independent regulatory commission. The hearing took place in March 2025.Blackburn forced to withdraw from WSL 2 on ‘sad day for women’s football’Read moreThe regulatory commission found that on 9 August 2024, London City Lionesses’ managing director, Sarah Batters, sent the player a message saying: “Hiya – just so you know, we’ve made the approach and have spoken to [redacted name] and they are open to sell … there’s the question of the fee, but what would your salary expectations be? Obviously I would love to make this happen!!”That message came three hours before Southampton responded to an earlier email received from London City’s recruitment manager, with Southampton explaining in their reply that they “won’t be engaging in conversations with you regarding a transfer”, with Southampton’s email adding “we have received interest from a number of clubs and some are prepared to meet the release fee” for the player.London City’s recruitment manager had explained in an email on 6 August that they would not be able to pay the release clause in her contract, the unspecific price of which had been clarified with her agent in a phone call earlier on that day. The hearing also heard that Batters had contacted the player via social media in July to ascertain the contact details for her agent.The regulatory commission, which noted that London City had apologised and cooperated with the disciplinary process, also revealed that London City had said they had been prepared to pay £150,000 to sign the player, and that sum was taken into account when calculating their £15,000 fine.Next season London City Lionesses will be the first fully independent women’s club to compete in the WSL, with no affiliation to a men’s side. They are owned by the American businesswoman Michele Kang, who also owns the recentlyrenamed French champions OL Lyonnesand the US-based club Washington Spirit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Seven clubs will enter the last round of matches unsure of which European competition they will be playing in next season, or in some cases whether they will be playing in Europe at all, with half of the division potentially competing in Uefa tournaments in 2025-26. Here is what is at stake on Sunday …Champions LeagueChampionsLiverpooland runners-upArsenalhave secured their places at the top table for next season but three of England’s five qualification spots remain up for grabs. The Premier League has gained an extra fifth Champions League place – a “European Performance Spot” – owing to English clubs’ results across Uefa competitions this season.Tottenham, the winners of Wednesday night’s Europa League final, also qualify, meaning there will be six English sides in the 36-team group phase.Three fromManchester City,Newcastle,Chelsea,Aston VillaandNottingham Forestwill join them. A win or a draw at Fulham will keep Pep Guardiola’s side among the European elite; Newcastle host Everton and Villa visit Old Trafford. The stakes are high for both clubs at the City Ground, where Forest host Chelsea knowing victory would secure their place in the Europa League or reward an excellent campaign with Champions League football should Newcastle or Villa drop points. Only an away win will keep Chelsea in control of their Champions League destiny.Europa LeagueCrystal Palacehave booked one of English football’s two places in next season’s Europa League courtesy of their historicFA Cup triumph against Manchester City. The sixth-placed Premier League team get the other. That could be any one of City, Newcastle, Chelsea, Villa or Forest.Conference LeagueAswinners of the Carabao Cup, Newcastle have gained entry to European football’s third tier competition.The complicated bitAnd it iscomplicated, and will not be decided untilChelseaplay Real Betis in the Conference League final next Wednesday. The winners of the Conference League qualify for the Europa League. However, if Enzo Maresca’s team win in Wroclaw and finish in the top five they will take their place in the Champions League and no other Premier League team will get their Europa League spot. But should Chelsea win the Conference League and finish sixth, with Newcastle finishing seventh, the Premier League receives an extra Europa League place. That would go to Eddie Howe’s team. The team finishing eighth in the Premier League would then qualify for the Conference League.Should Chelsea win the Conference League and finish seventh, the extra Europa League place would go to the sixth-placed team in the Premier League and, again, the team in eighth would qualify for the Conference League. That meansBrighton(who are at Spurs) andBrentford(away to Wolves) have something tangible to play for on the final day and England’s European contingent could swell to 10 next season. All clear? Good.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedTottenham HotspurManchester CityNewcastle UnitedChelseaAston VillaexplainersShareReuse this content"

Victory for Paris Saint-Germain against Reims in the French Cup final this weekend would confirm that Lyon qualify for theEuropa Leagueafter finishing sixth in Ligue 1.Crystal Palace keep party going as Eze’s glorious goal wraps up win over WolvesRead moreUefa’s club financial control body (CFCB) is believed to be preparing to look into the case, with a decision expected in early June. Regulations dictate that Palace – who can finish no higher than ninth in the Premier League with one game still to play – would miss out due to a lower placing in their domestic league if it decides that Textor’s influence at Selhurst Park goes beyond its restrictions. They include holding a majority of the shareholders’ voting rights or “being able to exercise by any means a decisive influence in the decision-making of the club”.It is understood that Palace will argue that the ownership structure at the club which gives Textor’s Eagle Football equal voting rights with co-owners Josh Harris, David Blitzer and the chair, Steve Parish, is evidence that there is no breach of the regulations. It is also understood that Eagle Football is not involved in any aspect of the operational running of the club – another of Uefa’s red lines.The Guardianreported recentlythat Textor has held talks with his fellow American shareholders Blitzer and Harris about buying their shares in Palace, which constitute about 36% of the club. He has previously signalled his intention to sell his stake in Palace after growing frustrated at his lack of influence in recruitment and other areas. Palace and Uefa did not comment when approached by the Guardian.Last month, the Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis,placed his shares in a blind trustin order to comply with Uefa regulations on multiclub ownership in anticipation of both Forest and the Greek club Olympiakos potentially qualifying for the same competition.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceLyonEuropa LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

It was duly delivered, after Eberechi Eze completeda 4-2 win over Wolveswith one of those goals only he can score, all grace and precision, off-the-cuff football played with south London swing. To the final whistle then, and a chance for the FA Cup to be run round Selhurst, hopefully with a bit more care than when Graeme Souness and Liverpool chums were lobbing around the old Football League Championship trophy like they were Orrell back-row forwards. The silverware took a while to arrive but when it did, it was in the arms of Joel Ward, making his final appearance as a Palace player, his 364th game. So long, Joel, and thanks for all the fish.But instead of another FA Cup beano, a club that had waited 101 years to win anything, give or take the ZDS Cup, launched a celebration of … Joel Ward. You know, Joel Ward, played 364 times for Crystal Palace, defender bloke, been there 13 years. Chairman Steve Parish was beside himself, wiping a tear when the player was subbed off in the 71st minute. “You’ve been a rock star,” he sobbed. Now, not even his better half, at pitch-side holding their baby, born just last Thursday, can believe Joel Ward, a man who has, beyond Croydon perhaps, been able to live life as incognito as the rest of us, is anything like Nick Cave or Ozzy Osbourne, let alone Billy Idol. Perhaps, though, in football, those who survive long enough deserve the tearful send-off. After all, as Liverpool’s psychodrama over Trent Alexander-Arnold’s departure suggests, football loyalty is in the eye of the beholder. Trent, by the by, runs a foundation for those, unlike him, who never made the grade and felt the cruelty of a profession that breaks hearts harder than any rock star.View image in fullscreenBig Lion King vibes.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockWhile Ward was being deified, at Eastlands a high-concept farewellwas being bade to Kevin De Bruyne, a true Manchester City great, the best midfielder of the last decade in the Premier League, perhaps second only to Colin Bell in club lore. Thing is, De Bruyne has been making noises that he would have preferred to stay. Ward, 35, meanwhile has featured in just three matches all season. Both have been cut from wage bills and given the soft landing of a leaving party at the closure of their employment contracts. Talking of which: Pep Guardiola, who stopped short of sobbing “he is so nice” of King Kev as he once did when jibbing out Sergio Agüero, was busy throwing the blue door marked “Do One” wide open, having spent £200m in January. “I don’t want to leave five or six players in the freezer,”he roared of his expensive squad-fillers. “I don’t want that. I will quit. Make a shorter squad, I will stay. It’s impossible for my soul.” OK. Right.

He had been serving in the army for six years and, as a native of the almost entirely occupied Luhansk region, knew the price of war better than most. It was soon to take a horrifying toll from him. Moskal stepped on a landmine shortly after the rotation and life changed irrevocably. The evacuation procedure went smoothly, in the circumstances, but his lower left leg could not be saved. It was hard not to think dark thoughts after two operations; tougher still given a prosthetic was nowhere on the horizon.Now it is mid-May. Wearing the red, yellow-trimmed shirt of FK Khrestonostsi, Moskal puffs out his cheeks before sitting in the dugout. He props his crutch against the neighbouring seat. The second half of the final is starting and he will take a breather. He smiles at his wife, Alina, who watches from the front row. This time he has remembered to wear his talisman, a metallic cross fastened around his neck, and he tells her it is the reason for his two goals. Soon he will almost certainly win his first football tournament. “Rest up or you won’t be able to lift the trophy,” a teammate advises.View image in fullscreenKonstantyn Moskal (pictured) used to prefer boxing to football before his injury on Ukraine’s frontline.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianHow can life ever compensate for the loss of something so fundamental? Almost everyone playing here is grappling with that question. The “League of the Mighty”, a competition created by the Ukrainian FA for its amputees, is trying to offer some kind of answer. BeforeRussia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine had no more than 10 registered amputee footballers. Now there are 170, which is about 15% of Europe’s total. Estimates suggest as many as50,000 people have lost limbsowing to the war.Moskal’s second surgery took place in Lutsk, in the country’s north-west. On another of those long, exacting days at the rehabilitation centre, he saw an advert on social media: Khrestonostsi (Crusaders) had formed there at the end of December and sought new recruits. He had previously been more into boxing, but a return to physical activity could not come quickly enough. If those around him were surprised, they knew not to suggest it was too soon. Within days Ihor Lytvynenko, a former Paralympian footballer who had been appointed the new club’s coach, drove to the centre and picked him up for training.“I don’t think he would feel the same comfort anywhere else that he does among this group,” says Lytvynenko, a kindly and soft-spoken figure. “This is all about a community: guys with similar issues who come together and support each other.”0:48MSK Dnipro play Pokrova in League of the Mighty amputee football tournament – videoEight teams are competing here in a tidy little ground close to the national stadium. The two-day tournament’s first edition was held in January. There are five in the Super League and a further three newcomers, including Khrestonostsi, playing for the First League trophy. Potential future competitors have been invited to take part in demonstrations and the expectation is that a fully fledged national league will begin later this year.‘Like a piece of a past life’: Shakhtar’s cup final win offers Ukraine hopeRead more“It’s about emotional gain, helping them rediscover this will to live,” says Bohdan Melnyk, the event’s development manager. “In some cases they’re now doing something they weren’t able to before their injuries. The key thing is that we don’t kick anyone out of a team. If you want to play, come to training and let’s do it. Everyone can try, we’ll always encourage each other.”Melnyk is speaking before the team he founded, Pokrova, take the field for a Super League match against Dnipro. Based in Lviv, Pokrova started out in September 2023 and have set a standard for the ecosystem Ukraine’s football authorities are creating. They were quickly accepted into Poland’s amputee Ekstraklasa league and are able to bring two teams here, along with support staff and a small group of supporters who chant to a drumbeat.Players come from as far as Odesa and Mykolaiv, 11 hours away by car, to represent Pokrova. Their expenses are paid. Everyone has their own tale of service, loss and hope. David, a Colombian soldier, travelled from his home city Barranquilla to fight for Ukraine. He lost a leg when a mine exploded near Kharkiv; now he plays for their second team and sits among them watching other games unfold. The jokes and repartee flow; he keeps up as best he can, for someone who barely speaks Ukrainian or English, and takes his turn on the drum. Football offers some level of certainty in what would otherwise be a strange and isolated existence.Then there is the bearded Andriy Mandryk, who Melnyk views as a shining example of what amputee football can achieve. Mandryk went through 25 surgical interventions after being injured near the front, eventually requiring a leg amputation. “He was in a really sad state and we invited him to training,” Melnyk says.View image in fullscreenDavid (left) joins in with the Pokrova supporters’ drum section.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The Guardian“He came and could barely walk on crutches: he brought his three-year-old daughter and was scared of falling, especially in front of her. Then I took the ball, kicked it towards the little girl and told her to pass it to her father. They started to play between themselves, and that’s how I first saw him smile after his injury. Now he’s the soul of the party and a totally different person.”Standing outside Pokrova’s dressing room, Mandryk calmly recounts how an Iskander rocket attack led to his appalling ordeal. He had been a goalkeeper in the same futsal team as Melnyk before becoming an army captain. “In the beginning it was hard but I’m almost there physically as a player,” says the 25-year-old Mandryk. “This is such an important rehabilitation for veterans. Without this kind of activity it’s not hard to start drinking or doing drugs.”Shakhtar Donetsk are here too, in the form of their well-developed Shakhtar Stalevi side. One of their players, Andriy Herasymchuk, was injured close to Kherson in October 2022. He had rarely played football before but is now a pillar of the side and training to be a referee. “Life is movement,” he says. “You need to move in order to stay alive. I’m just trying to do that.”There is no lack of activity on the pitch, which is scaled down to roughly two-thirds its regular size and provides the stage for two seven-a-side teams. This is a sport dependent on upper body strength: the ability to propel yourself, using a specially adapted support, around the surface and generate enough backlift to circulate the ball or shoot. The players’ impairments do not diminish their ingenuity and sheer skill, whether manifested in passing patterns, intuitive flicks, swift breaks or shot placement. One flicked finish in Pokrova’s win over Shakhtar brings the house down. Because this is present-day Ukraine, the subsequent break is prolonged by an air raid siren.Knocks and calls for treatment are common. Residual limb pain, affecting the remaining part of a leg or arm, can be agonising and blows to those regions are keenly felt given prosthetics are not worn. It is hard to get through a 50-minute game. Moskal has been struggling with such an issue from training and takes assistance from a colleague in applying freezing spray midway through Khrestonostsi’s opening match against Vinnytsia. His teammate, Vova, takes a nasty looking fall during the game.“Suka!”(“Bitch!”) exclaims Vova’s wife, Marina. “Don’t swear, this is going out on YouTube,” comes a voice from behind.The entire weekend is a slick production, VAR even being deployed to resolve penalty calls on a couple of occasions. Nobody hoped Ukraine would need to develop an advanced amputee football infrastructure but, now that the need is here and will only grow, the model being constructed looks serious, detailed and inclusive. Women are being integrated, a handful turning out for the Kyiv side Burevi.View image in fullscreenTetiana Matseshyna plays for Kyiv’s Burevi.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianMoskal, a dynamic presence on the right flank, returns for a cameo towards the end of the final. There is to be no hat-trick but Khrestonostsi have done more than enough, overcoming the Kharkiv-Dnipro side Nezlamni 3-0 and taking a prize that, for numerous reasons, nobody in the team could have envisaged winning. “I’m incredibly proud of my boys, they gave it everything,” says a visibly emotional Lytvynenko. “We’d never played on a big pitch, or on grass, before. The kits and boots weren’t worn in. It’s all new for us.”Khrestonostsi warm down and return to watch Pokrova win the Super League by comprehensively beating Shakhtar. As the minutes tick away, the stadium comes to its feet for a rendition of the national anthem. When the final whistle blows, flares light up in the stand. One wonders how and when these men will be able to fully reckon with the drastic change, the crushing deprivations and the colourful new possibilities they have been dealt.Standing on the winners’ podium at last, an exhausted Moskal holds up Khrestonostsi’s flag. He grins broadly, shyly, and receives his medal, handing it to Alina with a kiss after alighting. Victory means the team will receive a special reception with the mayor of Lutsk. In the coming days, Alina will join Moskal there and the pair will set up home for good. Plans will be made for a new life that already holds clear promise.View image in fullscreenFK Khrestonostsi (Crusaders) lift their trophy.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The Guardian“I need to recuperate and then we’ll see what’s next,” Moskal says afterwards. “It makes sense to feel happy, alive and celebrate moments like this. But at the same time, we must remember that we’re able to do it because of the guys who are out there, fighting for us.” Like everyone here, he has known both sides of a redemptive story whose complexities will endure.Explore more on these topicsFootballDisability and sportUkrainefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We need to add some experience to it. I’m the manager of the football club, that decision is not in my hands. All I care about is this thing [his medal]. There are no meetings planned – no one has said anything to me.“All I know is I’m going to go back to my hotel room, open a bottle of scotch, have a couple of quiet ones and prepare for a big parade on Friday. I don’t feel like I’ve completed the job yet, we’re still building. The moment I took the job, I wanted to win something. We’ve done that. It’s the toughest thing I’ve ever done.“The moment I accepted the role [as manager] I had one thing in my head, and that was to win something,” Postecoglou added. “More than anything else I had that in my head, and we’ve done that now so I want to build on it. I am super proud – this is one for the true believers. I’m still taking it all in. I know what it means for this football club. The longer it goes, the harder it is to break that cycle.“I could sense the nerves in everyone at the club and until you take that monkey off your back, you never understand what it feels like.“We have a young group and I hope by tasting this, the players feel different about themselves and what it means to them is unbelievable. I’ve always felt knockout football is different to league football and when you’re in that situation it comes down to good organisation, having a real gameplan and moments and you can minimise moments by having a strong foundation.”View image in fullscreenRuben Amorim of Manchester United. ‘I have nothing to show to the fans, so in this moment it is a little bit of faith,’ he said.Photograph: Jose Breton/NurPhoto/ShutterstockIn September Postecoglou declared he always wins a trophy in his second season at a club: “I always win things in my second season. Of this he said: “People misinterpreted me. It was not me boasting, just me making a declaration and I believed it. I had this thing inside me more than anything else. I know our league form has been unacceptable, but coming third was not going to change this football club, winning a trophy would, that was my ambition and I was prepared to wear it if it did not happen. People kept reminding me of it because we were getting closer but I’m happy with that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Amorim was asked what confidence he has that he can turn United around. “I have nothing to show to the fans, so in this moment it is a little bit of faith,” the Portuguese admitted. “Let’s see. I am always open, if the board and fans feel I am not the right guy, I will go in the next day without any conversation about compensation, but I will not quit. I am really confident in my job. And as you see I will not change nothing in the way I do things.”This is only the second time in 35 years United have not qualified for European, the previous time being Louis van Gaal’s opening season of 2014-15. If they had won the final Amorim’s team would have played Champions League football next season, which would have been worth approximately £100m“We have two plans for the market and we have to understand it is tough for a club like ours not to be in the Champions League,” the manager said.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueTottenham HotspurManchester UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

Having won the first set, Raducanu was 5-0 down when she called a medical timeout before returning to the court 10 minutes later. Although she was able to finish the match, she lost 4-6, 6-1, 6-3 to Collins.Drop by drop: Carlos Alcaraz leads shift back to the most deft shot in tennisRead moreWith the French Open starting on Sunday, Raducanu will now have the problem fully assessed before travelling to Paris, though the way she competed hard in a tight third set could suggest it was not too serious. She took a wildcard in eastern France to enter the final warm-up tournament for Roland Garros – not something she has usually done in the buildup to a grand slam.The British No 2, who is chasing Katie Boulter as the highest-ranked Briton, started off well by winning the first set against the world No 46. But her level immediately dropped and after walking through the fifth game, where she went 5-0 down, she left the court for lengthy treatment.Collins quickly wrapped up the second set and there was a fear she could also run away with the decider. But to her credit, Raducanu fought hard and was primed to take a 3-1 lead but could not convert four break points. It was tightly poised at 3-3 after an exchange of breaks, but Collins put her foot down to win the final three games as Raducanu fell away.Raducanu has added an extra tournament to her grass-court schedule after taking a wildcard into the BerlinTennisOpen. The former US Open champion will begin her campaign on the surface at the new WTA event at Queen’s Club next month before heading to the German capital for the tournament from 16-22 June.That means Raducanu will not be joining Boulter at the Nottingham Open, which takes place the same week. The Berlin tournament is a higher tier of the WTA Tour and therefore offers more ranking points and prize money. Raducanu will face fierce competition in Germany, with a stacked field led by world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka, and featuring nine of the top 10. Naomi Osaka, the four-time grand slam champion, has also been given a wildcard.Novak Djokovic, who is seeking his 100th career title on the ATP Tour, finally won a match on clay this season, beating Marton Fucsovics 6-2, 6-3 in the second round at the rainy Geneva Open.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic was in control at the Geneva Open.Photograph: Cyril Zingaro/EPA“My first win this season on clay obviously, it’s great to break the ice in a way. It’s a very demanding surface,” Djokovic said. He faced no break-point chances, landed 73% of his first serves and clinched the contest with a backhand winner on his second match point.“It helps if you have a good serve and today I think that was my strongest shot,” Djokovic added.The 37-year-old lost his two previous matches on clay, and his next opponent at the last warm-up event before the French Open is one of the players who beat him. He is scheduled to play Matteo Arnaldi who earlier advanced past Fabian Marozsan 6-3, 7-6 (3).

The possibility of repeating that feat has been discussed by Stokes, the coach Brendon McCullum, and the England and WalesCricketBoard’s managing director of men’s cricket, Rob Key.“When the rankings came out, I did send Baz and Keys [Rob Key] a text saying: ‘We’ve got one more place to go’,” Stokes said. “Baz uses this phrase a lot: ‘We’re starting from a place of strength.’ For us to be able to build on that, and everyone knows that we’ve got improvement to do. It’s very exciting that we are where we are as a team at the moment. Everyone understands and knows we’ve definitely got another level to go to.”One word in particular was to the fore as Stokes laid out the path ahead for England on the eve of their first game of the summer: “The word I love and what I’ve tried to instil in this team is ‘dominance’ and ‘dominate’,” he said. “Whatever situation we find ourselves in, that’s the word I want to be at the front of our heads. I want this team to dominate series, to dominate days, dominate every session. It’s not always going to happen like that, but that’s the mindset I want us to go out with every single day, so everything is aimed towards winning.”News of a fresh injury setback for Jofra Archer, whose damaged right thumb has ruled him out of the forthcoming ODI series against West Indies – for which Lancashire’s Luke Wood has been drafted in – and the England Lions game he was hoping to use as a springboard into a summer of red-ball cricket, is fresh evidence that plans can go awry.The Lions squad was announced and Stokes himself may join it depending on his performance against Zimbabwe, his first competitive action since December, when he tore his hamstring in Hamilton. “It will just be how I feel at the end of this, if I feel I need any more game time before we head into India,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I apologize to our fans, our partners and our organization for letting them down.”Penske is owner of Team Penske, IndyCar, Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indy 500. He has won the Indy 500 a record 20 times.Two-time defending Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden and teammate Will Power were found to have an illegally modified part on their cars ahead of Sunday’s final round of qualifications for the 109th running of the Indianapolis 500.Neither was allowed to qualify and both drivers were dropped to the back of the field and will start 32nd and 33rd. Rival teams have been arguing the punishments do not go far enough because the situation isthe second cheating scandalinvolving Team Penske in two seasons.Cindric and Ruzewski had already been suspended by IndyCar for the race.The trouble for Team Penske began before the fast 12 shootout on Sunday, when rival team owner Chip Ganassi was among a chorus of competitors who accused the team of cheating. They noticed unapproved changes had been made to the rear attenuator, a safety device designed to absorb and reduce the force of impacts, and the assumption was the modifications would have given the two Team Penske cars an aerodynamic advantage in their four-lap qualifying runs.Further investigation showed Newgarden’s winning car from last year that is displayed in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway museum has the same illegal modification, as did the car Team Penske brought to the White House last month. Rivals claim to have photos indicating the modification has been in place for some time.What made the outrage even greater that is was just one year ago that Team Penske was caught in a push-to-pass scandal in which Newgarden was found to have access to an additional boost of horsepower when he should not have at the season-opener. He was stripped of his win and Penske suspended Cindric for two races, including the Indy 500.Cindric is the biggest name to fall in this scandal. He’s a member of the Team Penske Hall of Fame and has been with the organization since 2000 as president of Penske Racing Inc. He’s been long assumed to be Penske’s successor on the racing part of Penske’s empire.Cindric was elevated to the role of president of Penske Performance in 2005 and, until February, essentially ran the day-to-day operations of all of Penske’s racing properties. But Penske’s right-hand man in February was stripped of most of his roles although he said he chose to step back as the overall leader of the organization. He remained president of the IndyCar program.Explore more on these topicsIndycarMotor sportUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Anthony Edwards, who had been averaging 26.5 points per game in the playoffs, was held to 18 points on 5-of-13 shooting.“I definitely got to shoot more. I took 13 shots, but I’ll say probably just get off the ball a little more,” Edwards said. “Play without the ball. I think that would be the answer, because playing on the ball, they’re just going to double and sit in the gaps all day. So I’ve got to go watch some film and take it apart and figure it out.”Edwards said the Thunder packed the paint, and he expects the Timberwolves to take advantage of that tactic going forward. Game 2 is on Thursday in Oklahoma City.“They bank on us not making shots, I guess, because every time I go to the rim it’s like four people,” he said. “So yeah, I guess they just be clogging the paint. They put like five, four bodies in the paint, make you kick it out. So keep making the right play.”Oklahoma City were just two days removed from eliminating Denver in Game 7 of the conference semifinals. Minnesota hadn’t played in a week.Minnesota led 48-44 at halftime as Randle scored 20 points and made 5 of 6 three-pointers. Gilgeous-Alexander was held to 11 points on 2-of-13 shooting before the break.“For us to play as poorly as we did offensively in the first half and be down four was a major victory for us at halftime,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said.The Thunder went on a 10-0 run in the third quarter to take a 66-60 lead. A short time later, Kenrich Williams, a rarely-used sub this postseason, hit a midrange jumper and a three-pointer on consecutive possessions to put the Thunder up 71-62. Oklahoma City outscored Minnesota 32-18 in the third quarter to take a 76-66 advantage into the fourth.A spinning dunk by Holmgren in traffic put Oklahoma City ahead 86-75 and drew a roar from the crowd. Gilgeous-Alexander threw up a prayer as he was being fouled while falling to the floor. The ball rolled in, and he made the free throw to make it 91-77 with seven minutes remaining.“It’s Game 1,” Minnesota coach Chris Finch said. “They won at home. Congrats to them. They played really well. There’s another game in two days.”Explore more on these topicsNBAOklahoma City ThunderIndiana PacersBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

With local celebrities such as Steve Kerr, Jonathan Kuminga and Brandi Chastain also in attendance,WNBAgames are suddenly a real Bay Area attraction.But it has taken the WNBA a long time to arrive. When the “W” started play in 1997, the San Francisco Bay was surprisingly excluded, despite its sports pedigree. Sacramento, roughly two hours away, was given its own team, the Monarchs, but they folded in 2009.Meanwhile, an opportunity for women’s basketball had been steadily accruing in the Bay Area. The franchise has already made history by becoming the first in the WNBA to surpass 10,000 season-ticket holders, a feat that was declared mid-game against the Sparks, who ultimately defeated the still-inexperienced Valkyries 84-67 on Friday. Chants of “GSV” and “Let’s Go Valkyries” broke out throughout the night at decibels that longtime Bay Area fans may recall from the days when the Golden State Warriors played at Oracle Arena. With the Valkyries’ practice facility and headquarters located in the previously vacant Warriors’ offices in downtownOakland, they’re sure to appeal to fans from all over the Bay’s shoreline, too.“There was nothing like this for a long time,” says Mickey, a 74-year-old who made the commute from Silicon Valley during rush hour for the inaugural Valkyries game (she requested not to publish her full name). Before tip off, she sat in front of the arena in an electric wheelchair wearing her Valkyries gear, soaking it all in. “I used to go to Sacramento to watch the WNBA; I didn’t miss a single playoff game [during the team’s championship season] in 2005. I’ve been waiting for a WNBA team in the Bay Area for over 27 years.”The air seems noticeably fresher in town with the WNBA – a league knownfor its social justice efforts, gender and labor equity advocacy, and its appeal to queer and non-traditional fans. Enthusiasts like Mickey abound here and are a reminder of the many dimensions of sports fandom that can thrive in a place like the Bay Area.And yet, Ballhalla (a de facto nickname for the Valkyries’ home court, and a playful ode to Valhalla, the mythic hall of fallen warriors in Nordic myth) wasn’t built overnight. Women’s basketball has had a rich, if not overlooked legacy in the Bay. And its phalanx of supporters, in tandem with the Bay Area’s vibrant arts and culture scenes, have been ready for their big shot.In 1969, Lew Alcindor – later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar – was the No 1 overall pick in the NBA draft; he went on to become a dominant Hall of Fame force who would change the sport. Yet, a far lesser known prospect was drafted that very same night. She who would have just as profound effect on the sport by becomingthe first hooper to break the league’s gender barrier.Denise Long was selected by the then-San Francisco Warriors in the 13th round with the 175th pick, becoming the only female player to be picked in the NBA draft. This was nearly 30 years before the formation of the WNBA.Long’s tenure as a professional basketballer in San Francisco didn’t last. The league’s commissioner, Walter Kennedy, immediately annulled the move, citing her status as a high schooler and gender. Warriors owner Franklin Mieuli, a bombastic Bay Area entrepreneur, had another gameplan – launching a women’s basketball league in nearby Daly City.View image in fullscreenGolden State Valkyries players gather on court after their opening game.Photograph: Jeff Chiu/APLong, who had scored more than 100 points in a single game three times in high school, would go on to headline the nascent, local women’s circuit (Mieuli gave his young star a purple Jaguar to show his esteem for her skills). That season, four women’s teams competed before every Warriors home game. But the league folded after one campaign, and Long moved back to her home state of Iowa to lead a quiet life away from basketball.Pro women’s basketball wouldn’t renew itself until 1979, when the San Francisco Pioneers of the Women’s Professional Basketball League made Oakland native Anna Johnsonthe first professional women’s player from the Bay Area. Like the Warriors’ upstart efforts, however, it proved too difficult to maintain a professional women’s franchise in the area. TheSan Jose Lasers (also funded by Lacob)would make an attempt in 1996, along with the San Jose Spiders, but both failed. And though the Stanford Cardinal assembled an college dynasty in Palo Alto, winning three national titles, the professional women’s game never caught a break in the Bay Area. Until now.Michelle Miller has worked for the Golden State Warriors, Bay Area Panthers and California Golden Bears. Better known asDJShellheart, she keeps the energy high at Bay Area sporting events. As a Black, queer woman rooted in the local hip-hop scene, she says nothing feels quite like working with the Valkyries as one of the team’s DJs.“This is the start of something bigger, just having a safe space to go, to feel comfortable and not be scared to speak about sports with [like minded] people,” she says. “The Valkyries coming to the Bay has shifted the energy. Since last year we’ve been doing community drives, girl’s camps focused on mental health, things that are just bringing positivity. This is the ideal place to have a team like this.”She’s just one of the Valkyries’ community partners. Others include artists like Kehlani, P-Lo, E-40 – who performed for the opening game’s half-time show to a raucous crowd – and Goapele, a legendary R&B singer who is appointed as one of the Valkyries’ public ambassadors. In an effort to build inroads within local arts and culture, the team has also initiated itsValkyries Collectiveprogram, featuring athletes, influencers and entertainers from the area.Even the Valkyries’ head coach Natalie Nakase, who becamethe first Asian American head coach in league history, has quasi-local roots. The Californian began her professional career as a point guard with the San Jose Spiders about an hour south of San Francisco.The organization’s focus on the local area can be seen in the arena’s rafters.Allison Huemanis a decorated Filipina muralist from the East Bay who grew up watching the Warriors. Though she has worked with the NBA in past seasons – evendesigning a Nike uniform for the Dubs in 2022-23– she is particularly excited to team up with the V’s. Her work often incorporates womanhood, femininity, and Bay Area immigrant identity. So it’s no surprise that she was brought on to paint a Valkyries-sponsored mural at their practice facility in Oakland. The work is sprawling, covering 200ft and unfurls elegantly across a long hallway: a surrealistic rendition of women in battle, running mid court, swords drawn, galloping towards what appears to be victory, clouded in a purplish, dreamlike haze. It is everything that a women’s basketball team in the Bay Area is, and may one day yet be.View image in fullscreenThe Valkyries have already built a passionate fanbase.Photograph: Jeff Chiu/APBack in San Francisco inside Splash Bar – a Steph Curry-backed sports bar, in whichthe NBA star has expressed his support for the Valkyries– WNBA games are being shown on a huge screen before Friday’s game. Outside, flocks of Valkyries fans mingle hours before tip off, eager to be a part of history.Fans like Teresa Guillen and Diane Rosen, Gen Xers who live in San Francisco and have had ties to the Warriors since the 70s, now have a top-shelf women’s team to root for. Former high school players like Yolanda Shavies, who grew up across the Bay Bridge in Oakland and once had aspirations of playing professionally. These are the fans who the team represents; and they certainly didn’t disappoint when they showed up for game number one.“We’ve been waiting a long time for this,” says Shavies, who crafted a Valkyries-emblazoned sword, which she carried around as an accessory to complement her violet shirt and color-coordinated Nikes. “I’ve been waiting a long time for this.”“We’ve found the finishing piece to what the Bay Area was missing,” DJShellheart says. “Adding the WNBA is like finishing that thousand-piece puzzle. It’s an image and color we could never fully see until now.”Explore more on these topicsGolden State ValkyriesWNBABasketballUS sportsWest CoastSan FranciscoOaklandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a gripping new account of the battle for AI supremacy, writer Karen Hao says we should all be wary of the power he now wieldsEmine SanerWed 21 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 21 May 2025 12.03 EDTShareThe short-lived firing ofSam Altman, the CEO of possibly the world’s most important AI company, was sensational. When he was sacked by OpenAI’s board members, some of them believed the stakes could not have been higher – the future of humanity – if the organisation continued under Altman. Imagine Succession, with added apocalypse vibes. In early November 2023, after three weeks of secret calls and varying degrees of paranoia, the OpenAI board agreed: Altman had to go.The drama didn’t stop there. After his removal, Altman’s most loyal staff resigned, and others signed an open letter calling for his reinstatement. Investors, including its biggest, Microsoft, got spooked. Without talent or funding, OpenAI – which developedChatGPTand was worth billions – wouldn’t even exist. Some who had been involved in the decision to fire Altman switched sides and within days, he was reinstated. Is he now untouchable? “Certainly he has entrenched his power,” says Karen Hao, the tech journalist whose new book, Empire of AI, details this saga in a tense and absorbing history of OpenAI. The current board is “much more allied with his interests,” she says.Hao’s book is a gripping read (subtitle: “Inside the Reckless Race for Total Domination”), featuring the unimaginably rich, as well as people in developing countries who are paid a pittance to root out the horrific sexual and violent content in the internet data that AI is trained on. The cast of characters that make up OpenAI have brilliant minds, and often eccentric behaviour. Elon Musk, after all, is one of its founders. Another founder and its chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever – who would be part of the failed attempt to remove Altman – dramatically illustrated his fears about the “unaligned” AI they had created byburning a wooden effigyconstructed to represent it in 2023 while his senior colleagues stood around a firepit at a luxury resort, wearing bathrobes.View image in fullscreen‘Every person that has clashed with Altman about his vision of AI has left’ … Journalist and author Karen Hao in Hong Kong.Photograph: Billy H C Kwok/The GuardianAt the centre of it all is Altman, OpenAI’s charismatic co-founder and CEO who is, depending how you view him, the villain who has put humanity on the path to mass extinction, or the visionary utopian who will bring uscures for diseasesand a revolution in how we work. In the less than two years it has taken Hao to write her book, Altman, 40, appears to have outmanoeuvred his dissenters and has announced plans to raise $7tn.Hao describes Altman as a “once-in-a-generation fundraising talent” and claims OpenAI’s chances of winning the AI arms race depend on raising vast sums. “He persuades people into ceding power to him, he doesn’t seize it. The reason he’s able to do this is because he’s incredibly good at understanding what people want and what motivates them. I came to understand that … when he is talking to someone, what comes out of his mouth is not necessarily correlated as much with his own beliefs as it is with what he thinks the other person needs to hear.” It’s why, she says, he was able to recruit so many talented people and get so much investment (and also what made some on his original board, and senior employees, nervous). “It’s also why he was able to pull off something that most people would not be able to do, which is to get the public to buy into this premise that he’s doing something profoundly good for society, just long enough to get away with it.”Within OpenAI, Hao points out, “every single person that has ever clashed with him about his vision of AI development has left – Musk has left, Dario Amodei has left, Sutskever has left [the three were early leaders in OpenAI] and a whole host of other people. Ultimately, they had a different idea of how AI should be developed. They challenged Altman, and Altman won.”View image in fullscreen‘A perfect case study’ … Annie, Sam Altman’s sister.Photograph: The Annie Altman Show/FacebookIn 2021, Altman’s sister Annie made the shocking allegation on what was then Twitter that he had sexually abused her as a child (he is nine years older). In January this year, she filed a lawsuit against him. In a statement released by Altman, his mother and his two brothers, they described the allegations as “utterly untrue” (his father died in 2018). Hao had several conversations with Annie, piecing together how her life unravelled. A bright child who planned to go to medical school, she suffered with poor mental health, and then developed a series of chronic physical health issues as a young adult. After her father’s death, her health declined even further and, as her family started cutting off financial help, she became estranged from them. Annie, says Hao, “is such a perfect case study of why we need to be sceptical of what Sam Altman says about the benefits of AI”. Altman claims AI is going to solve poverty and improve healthcare, but Annie – who lives in poverty and has health issues – hasn’t seen any of the benefits, says Hao. “She’s representative of more people, and how they live in the world, than he is, and it just so happens that this perfect case study is also his sister.”Despite agreeing to speak to Hao for her book, OpenAI eventually pulled out altogether, until they found out she was in touch with Annie. “This should be a family thing,” says Hao. “Why is a company representative now making this their top issue? That illustrated to me how important Sam, the man, is to the company.” It highlighted to her, she says, thatSilicon Valleycompanies, particularly when faced with criticism, “can bring their full power to bear to quash that dissent.”Hao studied mechanical engineering at university and moved to San Francisco after graduation to work for a startup. “I thought that was going to be my career, to be in Silicon Valley and do that whole journey,” she says, when we speak over Zoom. “I pretty much realised within the first year that the incentives within Silicon Valley for technology development were not aligned with the public interest.”View image in fullscreenTech companies ‘want their tools to feel like magic’ … Sam Altman at the Microsoft Build event in Seattle, Washington, in 2024.Photograph: Chona Kasinger/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesSo she moved into journalism and, writing for the magazine MIT Technology Review, became fascinated by AI. “I was primarily spending all my time talking with researchers within companies that were operating in academic-like environments, where they didn’t really have any commercial objectives. There was so much diversity of research happening.” There were also healthy debates. This was in 2016, around the time Donald Trump won his first election, and there had been a lot of criticism of the tech industry. “There was emerging research on AI and its impact on society. What are the harms? What are the biases embedded in models that lead to potential widespread discrimination and civil rights issues? That’s kind of where the AI world and discourse was before it got derailed by ChatGPT.”Within days of the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, it had one million users. Within a couple of months, it had 100 million users and had become the fastest growing consumer app in history. Hao felt its dazzling success had overshadowed those kind of debates, at least in the mainstream. “People were just buying what OpenAI and other companies were spoon-feeding in terms of narratives, like: this is going to cure cancer, this is going to solve the climate crisis, all these utopic things that you can’t even dream of.” She started working on what would become her book, looking at the history of OpenAI and its competitors. “Only when you have that context can you begin to understand that what these companies say should not be taken at face value.”Before Hao started following OpenAI more closely, she says she had a “pretty positive impression. I was curious about them; they were not a company, they were a non-profit, and they talked about how they were going to be transparent, open their research, and were focused on benefiting society”. Then, in 2019, things started to change; OpenAI developed a “capped-profit” structure (investors would have their returns capped at a very generous 100 times), Altman became CEO, they signed a billion-dollar deal with Microsoft, and started to withhold their research. “It seemed like quite a significant shift,” says Hao.“That is one of the reasons why OpenAI has had so much drama, but it’s also emblematic of AI development – it’s so much driven by ideology,” she says. “There’s this clash of egos and ideologies that’s happening, to try to seize the direction.” Within OpenAI, whether boomer (those who want to scale as fast as possible) or doomer (those who believe AI is a threat to humanity), the finish line was the same: to develop, and therefore control, AI first.View image in fullscreen‘What’s going to cause catastrophe is people, not rogue AI’ … OVHcloud datacentre in Roubaix, France.Photograph: Sameer Al-Doumy/AFP/Getty ImagesDoes Hao think AI poses an existential threat? “The biggest and most pressing threat is that AI is going to completely erode democracy and, if you understand that, the conclusion is then we should just stop developing this technology in the way that these companies are developing it.” The funnelling of resources “is a completely different scale than previous tech companies … They’re trying to justify raising the largest private investment rounds again and again – OpenAI having just raised $40bn in the latest round”. That kind of concentration of wealth, she says, “is in and of itself a threat. We are already seeing that play out with the US government, with the takeover by unelected tech billionaires.”The apocalyptic visions of a superintelligent AI turning against humanity have been a distraction, she thinks. “Ultimately, what’s going to cause catastrophe is people, not rogue AI, and we need to watch what the people are doing.” However, she has met people who genuinely believe AI will destroy humanity. “I spoke to people whose voices were literally quivering in fear, that is the degree to which they believe, and if you truly believe that, that’s terrifying.” Then there are those who use the idea of how AI could become so powerful as “a rhetorical tool to continue saying: ‘That’s why we good people need to continue controlling the technology and not have it be in the hands of bad people.’” But as far as Hao can see, “we’ve not gotten more democratic technologies, but more authoritarian ones.”Neither does Hao have much sympathy for the argument that the development of AI requires huge investment. “I don’t think it needs the level of investment these companies say it needs,” she says. “They have already spent hundreds of billions of dollars on developing a technology that has yet to achieve what they said it’s going to achieve,” says Hao. “And now you expect us to spend trillions? At what point do we decide that actually they’ve just failed?“When I was covering AI pre-ChatGPT and the wide range of research that was happening, there were such exciting ideas … ChatGPT erased people’s imaginations for what else could be possible.” Generative AI has taken over – not just OpenAI, but at other tech companies including Google’s DeepMind – and this, says Hao, “has distorted the landscape of research, because talent goes where the money goes.”The money doesn’t flow equally, though. Hao interviews people working for outsourced companies in Kenya, Colombia and Chile, who annotate the data that generative AI is trained on, sifting out harmful content for low pay and without much thought for their mental health. The AI, meanwhile, is powered by vast datacentres, buildings packed with computers, that require a huge amount of energy to run, and whose cooling systems require a huge amount of water. In the near future there will be even bigger datacentres known as “mega-campuses”. Just one of these could use more energy than three cities the size of San Francisco.The trouble with AI art isn’t just lack of originality. It’s something far bigger | Eric ReinhartRead moreThe premise of her book is that the AI giants are running an empire. But history shows us that empires can and do fall. Hao sees each step of the supply chain as a potential site of resistance. Artists and writers, for instance, arepushing backagainst their work being used to train generative AI (the Guardian has adealwith OpenAI for the use of its content). Enforcing data privacy laws, “are also ways to contain the empire”, as is forcing companies to be transparent about their environmental impact, from their energy consumption to where and how the minerals needed for hardware are extracted. Tech companies, says Hao, “want their tools to feel like magic” but she would like more public education to make people realise that each AI prompt uses resources and energy. Hitting these pressure points and more means, she says, “we can slowly shift back to a more democratic model of governing AI”.Compelling though he is, this isn’t just about Altman, the reigning emperor of AI. “It will take a far more concerted effort now to remove him,” she says, but adds, “we fixate a bit too much on the individual”. If, or when, Altman chooses to step down or is successfully ousted, will his successor be any different? “OpenAI is ultimately a product of Silicon Valley.” And anybody who may one day replace Altman, says Hao with foreboding, is going to pursue the same objective: “To build and fortify the empire.”Empire of AI: Inside the Reckless Race for Total Domination by Karen Hao is published by Allen Lane, Penguin (£25).

It’ll show up in Search soon!” read atweetfrom the game’s official account. As an upshot of its legal war with Apple, Epic established its own digital store.Fortnite is back on mobiles after four years thanks to EU lawRead moreThe video game, which features virtual gunfighting on a digital island, is coming back to theiPhonejust a few days after its parent company, Epic Games, filed a motion asking a federal judge to order its return as part of a civil contempt of court finding issued against Apple late last month. Last week, the game went dark on Apple devices the world over, and it remains unavailable on them in many countries.In a brief statement filed in court late on Tuesday,Applesaid the dispute that had been keeping Fortnite off its iOS software for the iPhone had been resolved. The Cupertino, California, company did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.The legal wrangling is all part of a bitter feud that is still boiling. Epic filed a lawsuit alleging Apple had turned its app store into an illegal monopoly – a claim that it lost under a 2021 ruling made by a federal judge after a month-long trial.Although she decided Apple was not breaking antitrust laws, US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ordered the company to loosen control over in-app payments and allow links to other options that might offer lower prices.After exhausting an appeal that went all the way to the US supreme court, Apple last year introduced a new system that opened the door for links to alternative payment options while still imposing a 27% commission on in-app transactions executed outside its own system.Epic fired back by alleging Apple was thumbing its nose at the legal system, reviving another round of court hearings that lasted nearly a year before Gonzalez Rogers delivered her stinging rebuke that included a ban on collecting any kind of commission on alternative payment options.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After Apple contended that keeping Fortnite was still permissible while it pursues an appeal of Gonzalez Rogers’s contempt ruling, Epic forced the issue by asking the judge for another order that would make clear the video game should be allowed back on the iPhone and iPad.Gonzalez Rogers on Monday asked why Apple was still blocking Fortnite without an order from the appeals court authorizing that action. She scheduled a 27 May hearing in Oakland, California, to hear Epic’s latest motion while noting “Apple is fully capable of resolving this issue without further briefing or a hearing.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyFortniteAppleiPhoneGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

M&S said on Wednesday it will take an estimated£300m hit to profitsafter itssystems were hackedlast month.The UK’s NationalCrimeAgency, whose remit includes combating cybercrime, said the group was a focus in its investigations.“We are looking at the group that is publicly known as Scattered Spider, but we’ve got a range of different hypotheses and we’ll follow the evidence to get to the offenders,” Paul Foster, the head of the NCA’s national cybercrime unit,told the BBC.He added: “In light of all the damage that we’re seeing, catching whoever is behind these attacks is our top priority.”Last week Googletold the Guardianthat UK-based members of Scattered Spider were actively “facilitating” cyber-attacks, as it warned that attempts to enter UK retailers’ systems were now being replicated in the US.The focus on a particular industry and geography is a common tactic of the Scattered Spider community, which communicates on platforms such as Discord and Telegram.The M&S hackers have deployed ransomware, or malicious software that locks up a target’s files, which is a cybercrime typically associated with Russian-speaking gangs and not native English speakers based in the UK or US.“We know that Scattered Spider are largely English-speaking but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re in the UK. We know that they communicate online among themselves in a range of different platforms and channels, which is, I guess, key to their ability to then be able to operate as a collective,” Foster said.It has been reported that the hackers have used ransomware called DragonForce, in a ransomware-as-a-service operation where hackers use another group’s malware and infrastructure in exchange for a cut of any financial proceeds from the attack. Ransomware attackers demand a sum, usually paid in cryptocurrency, in exchange for unlocking any hacked files and returning stolen data.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The restrictions are supposed to prevent the programs from providing harmful, biased or inappropriate responses to users’ questions.The engines that power chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude – large language models (LLMs) – are fed vast amounts of material from the internet.Despite efforts to strip harmful text from the training data, LLMs can still absorb information about illegal activities such as hacking, money laundering, insider trading and bomb-making. The security controls are designed to stop them using that information in their responses.In areporton the threat, the researchers conclude that it is easy to trick most AI-driven chatbots into generating harmful and illegal information, showing that the risk is “immediate, tangible and deeply concerning”.Chicago Sun-Times confirms AI was used to create reading list of books that don’t existRead more“What was once restricted to state actors or organised crime groups may soon be in the hands of anyone with a laptop or even a mobile phone,” the authors warn.The research, led by Prof Lior Rokach and Dr Michael Fire at Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, identified a growing threat from “dark LLMs”, AI models that are either deliberately designed without safety controls or modified through jailbreaks. Some are openly advertised online as having “no ethical guardrails” and being willing to assist with illegal activities such as cybercrime and fraud.Jailbreaking tends to use carefully crafted prompts to trick chatbots into generating responses that are normally prohibited. They work by exploiting the tension between the program’s primary goal to follow the user’s instructions, and its secondary goal to avoid generating harmful, biased, unethical or illegal answers. The prompts tend to create scenarios in which the program prioritises helpfulness over its safety constraints.To demonstrate the problem, the researchers developed a universal jailbreak that compromised multiple leading chatbots, enabling them to answer questions that should normally be refused. Once compromised, the LLMs consistently generated responses to almost any query, the report states.“It was shocking to see what this system of knowledge consists of,” Fire said. Examples included how to hack computer networks or make drugs, and step-by-step instructions for other criminal activities.“What sets this threat apart from previous technological risks is its unprecedented combination of accessibility, scalability and adaptability,” Rokach added.The researchers contacted leading providers of LLMs to alert them to the universal jailbreak but said the response was “underwhelming”. Several companies failed to respond, while others said jailbreak attacks fell outside the scope of bounty programs, which reward ethical hackers for flagging software vulnerabilities.The report says tech firms should screen training data more carefully, add robust firewalls to block risky queries and responses and develop “machine unlearning” techniques, so chatbots can “forget” any illicit information they absorb. Dark LLMs should be seen as “serious security risks”, comparable to unlicensed weapons and explosives, with providers being held accountable, it adds.Dr Ihsen Alouani, who works on AI security at Queen’s University Belfast, said jailbreak attacks on LLMs could pose real risks, from providing detailed instructions on weapon-making to convincing disinformation or social engineering and automated scams “with alarming sophistication”.“A key part of the solution is for companies to invest more seriously in red teaming and model-level robustness techniques, rather than relying solely on front-end safeguards. We also need clearer standards and independent oversight to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape,” he said.Prof Peter Garraghan, an AI security expert at Lancaster University, said: “Organisations must treat LLMs like any other critical software component – one that requires rigorous security testing, continuous red teaming and contextual threat modelling.“Yes, jailbreaks are a concern, but without understanding the full AI stack, accountability will remain superficial. Real security demands not just responsible disclosure, but responsible design and deployment practices,” he added.OpenAI, the firm that built ChatGPT, said its latest o1 model can reason about the firm’s safety policies, which improves its resilience to jailbreaks. The company added that it was always investigating ways to make the programs more robust.Meta, Google, Microsoft and Anthropic, have been approached for comment. Microsoft responded with alink to a blogon its work to safeguard against jailbreaks.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)HackingComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

But Huang told the Computex tech forum in Taipei that the controls had instead spurred on Chinese developers.“The local companies are very, very talented and very determined, and the export control gave them the spirit, the energy and the government support to accelerate their development,” Huang told media the Computex tech show in Taipei.“I think, all in all, the export control was a failure.”A journey through the hyper-political world of microchipsRead more“China has a vibrant technology ecosystem, and it’s very important to realise thatChinahas 50% of the world’s AI researchers, and China is incredibly good at software,” Huang said.Nvidia, whichdesigns high-end GPUs, has beenbattered by US chip export controls. Huang said on Wednesday the company had written off “billions of dollars” in sales, and it’s share of China’s AI chip market had fallen from almost 95% at the start of the Biden administration to 50%.Last monthHuang made a surprise visit to Beijing, where he met with the head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, according to Chinese state media, and the DeepSeek founder, Liang Wenfeng, according to the Financial Times.His visit came just days after further US restrictions banned shipments to China of Nvidia’s H20 datacentre GPUs, a lower-powered version of other Nvidia chips which was designed specifically to comply with Biden-era restrictions.The US government told Nvidia the new rules were designed to address the risk that its products might be “used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China”.Huang’s Beijing meeting with Liang was to discuss new chip designs for the AI company that would not trigger the new US bans, the FT report said.Last week the Trump administration rescinded some of the existing controls on chip sales to China, after some countries said they were being shut out from crucial technology needed to develop artificial intelligence.But it also unveiled fresh guidelines for other countries, warning companies that using Chinese-made hi-tech AI semiconductors, specifically tech company Huawei’s Ascend chips, could put them in breach of existing US export controls.In response China accused the US of “abusing export controls to suppress and contain China”. The commerce ministry said on Wednesday the warning was “typical unilateral bullying and protectionism, which seriously undermine the stability of the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain”.It also warned that “any organisation or individual that enforces or assists in enforcing such measures” could be in violation of Chinese law.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaChinaTaiwanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

In the 1990s, this kind of technology would be out of date after just a couple of years. There would be some tantalising new machine out before you knew it, everybody competing to be on the cutting edge: the Game Boy and Sega Genesis/Mega Drive in 1989 were followed by the Game Gear in 1990 and the Super NES in 1991. Five years was a long life for a gaming machine.Now, it’s more like 10. TheNintendo Switch 2will be released in a couple of weeks, more than eight years since I first picked an original Switch up off its dock and marvelled at the instant transition to portable play. Games consoles often feel like they mark off particular eras in my life: the Nintendo 64 was the defining console of my childhood, the PlayStation 2 of my adolescence, and theXbox 360of the first years of my career, the first console launch I ever covered as a (ridiculously young) journalist. TheNintendo Switchcame along just a few months after my first child was born, and for me it has become the games machine of that era of harried early parenthood.When I reflect on my experiences with the Switch, I remember snatching moments inBreath of the Wild’s Hyrule while the baby napped beside me; hiding on the veranda of a French villa to play the odd Splatoon match on our first family holiday; and trying to make a mint on my Animal Crossing turnip trades while walking my second baby around the house in his sling, trying to get him to sleep (he never did). When they got old enough, the first games I playedwithmy children were on the Switch. We all played Pokémon Sword and Shield together, and most recently my youngest made his way through the surprisingly entertainingPrincess Peach Showtimewith only minimal assistance from me.View image in fullscreenHello to the moo … The Nintendo Switch created a unique gaming space all of its own.Photograph: Justin Lane/EPAOver the last eight years, my living room TV became dominated by things like Bluey and Moana and most recently (god help me), Alvin and the Chipmunks, and I no longer have the hours of uninterrupted gaming time in the evenings. The Switch gave me some of that that time back, though, letting me dip into games whenever I had a moment – which gave me vital stress relief, aroute back to myselfduring some of the most challenging years of my life. Eight years is a long time, enough for anyone’s life to change beyond recognition. In that time I’ve lost people, moved cities, gained new friends, too. And, of course, we all went through the pandemic.Animal Crossing: New Horizonsbecame perhaps the defining game of that time, and I am not the only person for whom the Switch was a blessed oasis, a way to connect when we were starved of in-person interaction.Things have changed for me since 2017, as they probably have for you. Consoles feel like companions, especially perhaps the portable ones like the Switch and the Game Boy, which we literally carry with us wherever we go. My kids are older now, enjoying all the Switch games that I enjoyed when they were very small – and it does seem as if the Switch 2 will neatly mark another new stage, for me and for them.I recently gathered together all the Switch consoles, games, controllers and accessories in my house and my office for an audit, from the battered day-one unit that serves as the family console to the untouched OLED Zelda special edition my partner got me and the variably functioning spare JoyCons accumulated over time. It’s not quite time for them to join the other old consoles under my bed, each in a clear plastic box with all of its cables, ready to be dusted off when the time comes; the Switch 2 will take its place in my rucksack and in my office, but I won’t be upgrading the family console for some time yet. I don’t really wantto. I think the Switch is probably my favourite console I’ve ever owned, not just because its best games are real hall-of-famers that will be remembered in another 20 years, and not just because its hybrid home-portable nature was a feat of technical wizardry that genuinely changed how I play – but also because of the space it has occupied in my life.A little sentimentality is forgivable at the end of an era. In a couple of weeks all the talk will be about the new console, how it’s selling, whether it’s worth the money, what the best Mario Kart World strategies are, and how it compares to its record-breaking predecessor. For now, I’m not thinking much about what theNintendo Switchmeant for the gaming industry; instead I’m thinking about what it meant to me.What to playBe who you wanna be … there are many lives to choose from in the latest RPG, Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time.Illustration: Level5/Have you ever heard ofFantasy Life? It was a bit of a cult hit on the Nintendo 3DS in 2014, a cosy-feeling role-playing game that let you switch between 12 different professions, so you would be blacksmithing one minute, fighting monsters another and cooking things up the next. The sequel –Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time –is out today after years of delays.You can now be an artist or a farmer as well as a magician, carpenter, fisherman, alchemist or whatever else you fancy, and also it adds time travel into the mix. It’s an intriguing amalgamation of the Animal Crossing/Harvest Moon style of Japanese life simulator, and the Dragon Quest/Ni no Kuni flavour of unthreatening role-playing game, and I’m looking forward to exploring it.

My opinion has somewhat changed now that the successor to the Nintendo Switch is called Switch 2. Do you have any thoughts on console names?”It’s true that Nintendo usually goes for completely new names for each console, except arguably the series ofGame Boys, theNESandSuper NES,WiiandWii U, and nowSwitchandSwitch 2. And yes, this is the first time they’ve gone for a number. I’d say this is down to how badly the company did with the Wii U, whose confusing name surely contributed to how badly it flopped. But I think it reflects the more conservative and cautious mood of the games industry as a whole in 2025, as it comes to the end of decades’ worth of unsustainably rapid growth. Or maybe it’s because Nintendo’s president Shuntaro Furukawa used to be an accountant.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterNintendo SwitchGames consolesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A clearer sign was his apparentsympathywith Vladimir Putin. Mr Trump’s tone regarding the Russian president hascooled somewhaton the discovery that the conflict cannot be frozen by White House diktat. There are hints of recognition that the peace process is failing because the Kremlin is cynically playing for time. Sadly, any such insight hasn’t evolved into outrage at the criminal aggression that started the war in the first place.Accounts of atelephone callbetween the two leaders earlier this week indicate no increase in American pressure on Russia. Mr Trump’s impatience with the whole issue seems likelier to result in him walking away. Mr Putin relishes that prospect.Ukraine’s European allies have tried to coax Mr Trump into a more pro-Kyiv stance, while making contingency plans for US disengagement. But even on optimistic projections of increased defence spending, Europe is a long way from achieving capacity to provide for its own security. For now, American help is indispensable.Ukraine’s military has beaten the odds and defied gloomy prognoses before, checked Russian advances and inflicted bruising defeats on their aggressor. But Mr Putin has a grim advantage in numbers. He calculates that time is on his side, that he can keep feeding conscripts into what Russians call the “meat grinder” and, by means of bloody attrition, force Volodymyr Zelenskyy to submit.Russia’s military resources are finite. And, while Mr Putin has repressed domestic dissent, he cannot indefinitely brush aside the deaths of many tens of thousands of young men. State propaganda celebrations of a war that has achieved none of its declared aims ring hollow.Mr Putin’s greatest weakness is a brittle economy, geared to perpetual war, that is failing to meet the needs of civilians whose living standards have been degraded by inflation. Russia’s budget is dependent on oil revenues, and the price of crude has fallen recently (partly in response to Mr Trump’s trade-suffocating tariffs). Western sanctions already impose a price cap on Russian oil exports and the EU has proposed lowering it further.Brussels and the UK this week coordinated a further round ofsanctions, including efforts to close the “shadow fleet” loophole that sustains Kremlin oil revenues. Ukraine is urging its European friends to go further still, with secondary sanctions targeting countries that buy from Russia or provide it with technological assistance.Across the Atlantic, a majority of US senators support the application of firmer economic pressure on Moscow, but Mr Trump prefers emollience and even normalisation of commercial relations.The US president’s Kremlin-friendly bias has been a consistent obstacle to the defence of Ukraine, but not an entirely immovable one. He doesn’t want to look weak – an aversion that can be mobilised to dissuade him from total appeasement of Mr Putin.The Russian president might also have less time than he thinks. He projects an image of himself as a master strategist, but the evidence of a hubristically launched and badly run war doesn’t support that analysis. The Kremlin can lie about the grim state of theRussian economy, but can’t hide it for ever. That is a vulnerability which Ukraine’s allies must continue to target with maximum force.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Companies ignore these findings at their own riskWed 21 May 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 21 May 2025 18.30 EDTShareWhen the pandemic hit in early 2020, organizations pivoted overnight to remote and hybrid models to survive. Nearly five years later, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, Dell andGoldman Sachshaveenforcedfive-day-in-office mandates, while US federal agencies imposed on-site requirements for more than 400,000 employees.These actions rely on outdated assumptions about productivity, culture and resilience, according to authoritative federal government data. A May 2025reportfrom the non-partisan Government Accountability Office (GAO), Telework: Private Sector Stakeholder and Expert Views, shows that telework offers clear advantages when leaders embrace strategic culture-building, robust performance tracking and available regulatory guidance. Companies ignoring these insights risk talent attrition, rising costs and reduced agility in an era that demands adaptability.Flexibility now drives talent acquisition and retention more powerfully than traditional perks. Interviews in the GAO study reveal one technology firm cut voluntary turnover by 33% after offering two remote days each week. Across industries, employees cite autonomy and work–life balance as top priorities when evaluating offers. Remote work removes geographic barriers for candidates facing challenges such as caregiving, disabilities or rural isolation. A National Bureau of Economic Research analysis cited in the report found full-time employment among workers with disabilities rose by 12% on average – and by as much as 40% in computer roles – once telework became widespread. Veterans, caregivers and parents of young children similarly gain access to roles they would otherwise forego, expanding the talent pipeline. By hiring beyond traditional office locations, organizations retain top performers who might otherwise resign due to relocation or caregiving conflicts.Telework can deliver significant cost savings and measurable productivity gains at scale. Organizations in the GAO report halved their office footprints and slashed lease expenses, redirecting budgets toward home-office stipends rather than fixed desks. Some reported saving millions annually in real estate costs alone. Employees reclaim an average of 55 minutes daily by skipping commutes, boosting focus and reducing burnout, while employers report fewer sick days and lower absenteeism. Research reviewed by the GAO indicates a 12% performance lift for roles with clear metrics when executed remotely, thanks to fewer interruptions and personalized work environments. Reduced commuting and lower energy use help companies meet sustainability goals and support corporate social responsibility commitments, while ensuring continuity during severe weather, transit disruptions or other emergencies.I was secretary of labor. Trump’s bizarre tariff scheme won’t revive American jobs | Robert ReichRead moreWorkers and employers in the study did raise concern about difficulties in building workplace culture and relationships – and indeed, building a cohesive culture in distributed teams demands intentional effort. Leading companies foster connection through weekly video huddles, virtual coffee chats and cross-team recognition ceremonies that spark collaboration and belonging. Mentorship programs pair new hires with seasoned employees, and all-hands virtual events celebrate milestones and reinforce shared values. Clear communication protocols and compliance frameworks – drawing on Department of Labor guidelines and multistate payroll solutions – ensure legal peace of mind and maintain consistent policies across jurisdictions. Robust IT safeguards, ergonomic stipends and mental wellness resources protect sensitive data and support employee health across locations, demonstrating an organization’s commitment to its people.Insisting on full-time return-to-office mandates now carries steep risks to competitiveness and culture. The GAO report highlights one business that lost half its workforce – including key leaders – after enforcing a strict in-office policy. In contrast, organizations embracing a remote-first mindset enjoy minimal turnover, higher morale and stronger employer brands, attracting top talent even in saturated markets. Experts advise publishing telework eligibility in job postings, investing in high-speed broadband infrastructure and designing compensation models that reward flexibility and fairness. The GAO’s data-driven findings deliver a clear roadmap: integrate remote work strategically to attract talent, reduce costs and enhance productivity. Leaders who act now will build resilient, high-performing teams prepared for whatever challenges lie ahead in a competitive global landscape.Gleb Tsipursky, PhD, is the CEO of the future-of-work consultancy Disaster Avoidance ExpertsExplore more on these topicsWorking from homeOpinionUS work & careerscommentShareReuse this content"

John Ewing Jr, a longtime county treasurer, was elected the first Black mayor of Omaha, defeating the incumbent Jean Stothert, who was seeking a fourth term after holding that office since 2013. More than that, Ewing won big, by nearly13 points, marking a huge shift after Stothert won her last race by 30.Ewing ran a substantive, highly localized campaign that built upon decades of credibility he earned as a public servant – supplemented by the longstanding work of the Nebraska Democratic party to build coalitions in a traditionally deep-red state. In swinging this race by 43 points, they have both inspired hope that the political winds may be shifting, and provided a model forDemocratsto succeed in 2026 and beyond.The results in Omaha are meaningful not for the scale of the city, but for how it may reflect the country as a whole. Omaha’s congressional seat – Nebraska’s second – is a true swing district, one of only three in the country that voted for Kamala Harris in 2024 while also electing a Republican to Congress. It’s a diverse, medium-sized, midwestern city – and if that isn’t enough to convey its heartland status, it’s nearly in thegeographic centerof the contiguous United States.For all of these reasons, it’s instructive for Democrats to understand the strategy of the chair of the Nebraska Democratic party, who now serves as president of the Association of State Democratic Committees (ASDC) and a DNC vice-chair: Jane Kleeb. In a moment when so much media attention has been focused on internal procedural drama surroundingcertain other vice-chairs, Kleeb and the Nebraska Democratic party have continued their longstanding focus on the day-to-day work.In the waning days of the Omaha mayoral election, Stothert attempted to negatively polarize voters against Ewing by nationalizing the race – and, in particular, hammering the GOP’s favorite wedge issue target of late:trans people. As my colleague John Nichols wrote about last week for the Nation,this did not work. Instead, Ewing refused to take the bait and kept his focus on tangible municipal issues – such ashousing,street pavingand even astruggling streetcar project. In a simple graphic released three days before the election, the Nebraska Democratic partyproudly declared: “Jean is focused on potties. John is focused on fixing potholes.”As thousands of Democrats across the country seek election up and down the ballot in 2026, they too could decline to debate on Republican terms and instead run campaigns relentlessly focused on improving their constituents’ lives.Successful as this campaign was, it also builds upon statewide efforts from the Nebraska Democratic party to compete in unfavorable territory. Kleeb haslong advocatedfor Democrats to perform direct outreach to rural voters – and it’s not the same thing as pandering. Instead, it means recognizing real problems that, say, farmers are experiencing and offering practical solutions.Inher words: “In rural and small towns we may not use the word ‘climate change’ in the first five sentences, but everything we’re doing is talking about protecting the land and water.”And progressives in Nebraska know a thing or two about the value of avoiding toxic political labels. When the navy veteran, mechanic and union leader Dan Osborn ran a populist, independent campaign for Senate last year, the Nebraska Democratic party stepped aside and chose not to run a candidate. While Osborn and the state partyhad their differences– and he ultimately lost – this unorthodox strategy showed serious upside. Osborn came closer to defeating the incumbent Republican than any other challenger in the 2024 cycle; now he’s looking at a2026 runin much more favorable circumstances.With lessons to learn from the success in Nebraska, it is encouraging that Kleeb now holds a prominent leadership position in the national Democratic party – the same role that Ken Martinheldbefore he became chair. As head of the ASDC, Kleeb is well positioned to work with all 50 state chairs to get them the resources they need – and it will be all 50, as she and the DNC recently announced that the national organization will becontributing moreto state parties as part of a re-emerging 50 state strategy.But even if Kleeb’s ascendance only meant that the Democratic party got better at competing in Nebraska, it could prove decisive. Given that the House is currently held by Republicans by a handful of seats (give or take whateverdisgraced resignationshappen between now and next November), the race in Nebraska’s second district could very well be the tipping point for control of the lower chamber. Representative Don Bacon, who held on to his seat by less than 2 pointslast cycle, may wellretirebefore he has a chance to lose.Whether the race for Congress in 2026 comes down to Omaha itself or someplace like it, Democratic victories will depend on a nationwide effort to invest as deeply in local concerns as Kleeb and Ewing have. That strategy can be summed up with a mantra that Kleeb has repeated time and time again – what you may call Jane’s refrain: “When we organize everywhere, we can win anywhere!”Katrina vanden Heuvel is editorial director and publisher of the Nation, she is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and she has contributed to theWashington Post, the New York Times and the Los Angeles TimesExplore more on these topicsDemocratsOpinionNebraskaUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But there’s an easy fix for our debtRobert ReichInstead of cutting taxes on the richest Americans – who hold much of the country’s debt – simply raise themWed 21 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 21 May 2025 09.52 EDTShareOn Friday, thecredit rating of the United States was downgraded. Moody’s, the ratings firm, announced that the government’s rising debt levels would grow further if theTrumpRepublican package of new tax cuts were enacted. This makes lending to the US riskier.Moody’s is the third of the three major credit-rating agencies to downgrade the credit rating of the United States.So-called “bond vigilantes” have already been selling the US government’s debt, as the Republican tax package moves through Congress. They’re expected to sell even more, driving long-term interest rates even higher to make up for the growing risk of holding US debt.Some rightwingRepublicansin Congress are using the Moody’s downgrade to justify deeper spending cuts in Medicaid, food stamps and other social programs that lower-income Americans depend on.But, hello? There’s a far easier way to reduce the federal debt. Just end the Trump tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy and big corporations – and insteadraisetaxes on them.I’m old enough to remember when the US’s super-rich financed the government with their tax payments. Under Dwight Eisenhower – hardly a leftwing radical – the highest marginal tax rate was 91%. (Even after all tax credits and deductions were figured in, the super-rich paid way over half their top marginal incomes in taxes.)But since the Reagan, George W Bush and Trump 1 tax cuts, tax rates on the super-rich have plummeted.So instead of financing the government with their taxes, the super-rich have been financing the US government bylending it money.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Robert ReichFree newsletterGet Robert Reich’s latest columns delivered straight to your inboxEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wrong.More than 70%of it is held byAmericans– and most of them are wealthy.)This means that an ever-increasing portion of the taxes from therestof us are dedicated to paying ever-increasing interest payments on the debt – payments that go largely to the super-rich.So when the debt of the United States is downgraded because Trump Republicans are planning another big tax cut mainly benefiting the rich and big corporations, most Americans could end up paying in three different ways:They’ll pay evenmoreinterest on the growing debt – to the super-rich.They’ll pay higher interest rates on all other long-term debt. (As higher rates on treasury bonds waft through the economy, they raise borrowing costs on everything from mortgages to auto loans.)The debt crisis will give Republicans even more excuse to do what they’re always wanting to do: slash safety nets. So many Americans could lose benefits they rely on, such asMedicaidand food stamps.The “bond vigilantes” are not the cause of this absurdity. Neither is Moody’s or the other credit-rating agencies. Nor, for that matter, is the growing national debt.What’s the underlying cause? Just follow the money. It’s the growing political power of the super-rich and big corporations to lower their taxes at the expense of most Americans.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

In return, he is already critiquing their worldviewWed 21 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 21 May 2025 14.14 EDTShareIn the outer reaches of the Magasphere, it would be fair to say the advent of the first pope from the US has not been greeted with unbridled enthusiasm. Take Laura Loomer, the thirtysomething influencer and conspiracy theorist, whoseverdicton Leo XIV was as instant as it was theologically uninformed: “Anti-Trump, anti-Maga, pro-open Borders, and a total Marxist like Pope Francis.” Also doing the rounds on X was a shortsummaryof Leo’s supposed transgressions before ascending to St Peter’s chair: “Trashed Trump, trashed Vance, trashed border enforcement, endorsed DREAMer-style illegal immigration, repeatedly praised and honored George Floyd, and endorsed a Democrat senator’s call for more gun control.”So far, so tedious. The comic-book casting of the new pope as a globalist villain in the US culture wars is traceable back to his predecessor’s impact on liberal opinion a decade ago. Pope Francis’s sometimes lonely championing of progressive causes, such as the rights of migrants, gave him a kind of liberal celebrity and led Time magazine toname him“person of the year” in 2013. Pope Leo, born in Chicago, has been pre-emptively caricatured by much of the Maga right as a continuity pontiff who will, in effect, front up the religious wing of the Democratic party.Leaving the simplistic conflation of religious perspective and political positioning aside, the truth is far more interesting than that. It may also be more challenging for Catholic Maga luminaries such as the vice-president,JD Vance, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and Donald Trump’s sometime adviser Steve Bannon if they are serious about their faith.Bannon and Vance – aCatholic convert– are representatives of a traditionalist movement in the church, which sought toundermineFrancis’s papacy at every turn and has become a kind of theological vanguard for the “America first” era. In January, Vance notoriously invoked St Augustine tojustifythe Trump administration’s decision to cut international aid and impose a brutal immigration crackdown. One of Francis’s last acts was to refute the vice-president’s reduction of the Augustinian concept of neighbourly love to a version of “charity begins at home” (though delivering a papal rebuke was not enough to spare him from avisit from Vancethe day before he died).But it would be too easy (and too reminiscent of their own performatively aggressive approach) to simply dismiss the Maga Catholics as theologically beyond the pale. Many Catholics might, for example, legitimately sympathise with Bannon’s analysis of the neglect of working-class interests in 21st-century western liberal democracies. The deepening inequality and corrosive individualism of our times is seriously at odds with Catholic social teaching, which has historicallypromotedthe dignity of labour, social solidarity and a just wage.The problem is that, in the absence of a leftwing economic populism to challenge the injustices of the globalised era, a rightwing version has filled the gap in the US and beyond. Its form of solidarity is nationalistic and insular, its cultural outlook is xenophobic and its political style is authoritarian and deliberately confrontational. The Maga critique of “globalism” is not limited to the neoliberal economic world order, also condemned by the last three popes; it extends to a repudiation of the foundational Catholic commitment to universality, expressed through compassion for the stranger and a sense of the world as a shared common home.Enter Pope Leo. The mostgeographically diverse conclavein church history was surely aware that in choosing an American to succeed Francis, it was setting up a potential showdown between the Vatican and Trumpian nationalism. The new pope’schoice of nameis a sign that he recognises the scale and the novelty of the challenge that the rightwing populist turn represents.The last Leo, a patrician Italianelectedto the papacy in 1878, made it his mission to confront the ruthless laissez-faire economics unleashed by the Industrial Revolution and the emerging Marxist response to its cruelties. InRerum Novarum, his groundbreaking 1891 papal encyclical, Leo XIII laid out swingeing criticisms of the greed that placed profit before people and allowed extreme divides in wealth to undermine the common good. At the same time, in terms that were to prove tragically prescient, he identified in early communist movements a dangerous idolatry of the state and a lack of respect for individual autonomy and rights.Last weekend, before hisfirst mass in St Peter’s Square, Leo XIV explicitly set himself the task of following in his 19th-century predecessor’s footsteps. That would mean, he told a Rome conference, addressing “the dramatic nature of our own age, marked by wars, climate change, growing inequalities, forced and contested migration, stigmatised poverty, disruptive technological innovations, job insecurity and precarious labour rights”.The daunting length of that list, and the interlocking, global nature of its crises, should be viewed as an early critique of the Maga worldview. In Leo XIII’s day, the burgeoning Marxist movement incubated a totalitarian strain that would go viral in the 20th century. The success of Trumpian nationalism is also in part a response to the depredations of capitalism, this time in the context of globalisation. But its authoritarian evangelists have hijacked the working-class cause to inflict new injustices on migrant “invaders” and have lost sight of the need for global cooperation to prevent an environmental catastrophe that threatens the poor most of all. The strategy has proved electorally astute. But as Leo will surely make clear, it has nothing to do withCatholicism.In acolumnpublished at the weekend, the American Catholic commentator Sohrab Ahmari referenced asermonby Leo from last year, in which the future pope acknowledged that the issue of migration “is a huge problem, and it’s a problem worldwide” that needed to be solved. This recognition, Ahmari suggested, could at least open up the possibility of fruitful future dialogue with the Maga Catholics in and around the White House.He failed, however, to quote the sermon’s next passage: “Every one of us, whether we were born in the United States of America or on the North Pole, we are all given the gift of being created in the image and likeness of God, and the day we forget that is the day we forget who we are.” Words for Vance and Rubio, who met Leo after Sunday’s inaugural mass in Rome, to ponder.Julian Coman is a Guardian associate editorExplore more on these topicsPope Leo XIVOpinionTrump administrationJD VanceCatholicismUS politicsVaticanThe papacycommentShareReuse this content"

Most would wax lyrical about their school days and the teachers who taught and inspired them.Yet the government of which those women make up almost half the total number of MPs is now targeting spending on “education and gender” for cuts in the overseas aid budget. It is beyond depressing.Jenny Chapman, the international development minister, could not have been clearer when giving evidence to a select committee last week. The decision to reduce aid spending from 0.5% to 0.3% of national income by 2027 meant something had to give, and that was money that had hitherto been spent not just on building schools in poor countries but also encouraging girls to attend them. In a more challenging spending environment, the UK will now make health its priority.Make no mistake, Chapman faces some unenviable choices. There is no soft landing when you have to implement a 40% cut in your budget. But a slash-and-burn approach to education is indefensible and would have been anathema to previous Labour governments.Things were certainly different 20 years ago, when the final preparations for a G8 summit at Gleneagles involved the prime minister, Tony Blair, and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, successfully lobbying fellow world leaders for a$50bn aid packageand a comprehensive debt relief deal.Times are tougher now. At the time of Gleneagles, the global economy was booming and government finances were healthy. The global financial crisis was still two years away, and only the most inveterate pessimists foresaw the age of austerity that would follow the near collapse of the banks.In 2005, the rich countries of the west were minded to be generous. Today they are not, and it is naive to imagine that the aid budget is going to remain sacrosanct when the British government is planningcuts to disability benefits.All that said, cutting aid spending on education for girls is still a bad policy choice. Before it was axed as a standalone ministry by the Conservatives and subsumed into the Foreign Office, the Department for International Development commissioned countless studies into whether spending money on encouraging girls to go to school should be a priority for the aid budget. It concluded that it should be – and for good reasons.Women with an education are far more likely to go to a clinic and have their children vaccinated. They are also more likely to get antenatal care and seek early treatment for diarrhoea and pneumonia, both potential killers.The evidence is compelling: if all women completed primary education and gained basic literacy, maternal deathswould be reducedby two-thirds.In Malawi, each additional year of maternal education cut infant mortality by 10%. In Uganda, each extra year of schooling cut the risk of infant mortality by more than 16%. Chapman seems not to get the point that cutting education spending will reduce the effectiveness of spending on health.In 1996, the year before he became prime minister, Blair said the three priorities for a Labour government would be “education, education, education”, and the reason he said that was because investment in education is good for growth and boosts living standards. That applies even more to poor countries than it does to rich countries. In a low-income nation, every year of schooling results in a10% increasein earnings.Nor is investing in education costly. One study has found that $100 (£75) pays for the equivalent oftwo extra yearsof teaching for girls. With the government keen to ensure that every penny of a reduced aid budget is used effectively, that represents excellent value for money.Ministers of all parties once accepted all these arguments as a matter of course. This, for example, wasAlok Sharma, Boris Johnson’s international development secretary, back in 2019: “Educating girls prevents child marriage and early pregnancy, helps women into the workforce and boosts household incomes and economic growth. Supporting education for girls and women gives them a greater voice. That voice helps them to shape their own future and advocate for changes in their own lives and, very importantly, the lives of other girls and women.”All of which remains as true now as it was then. Education is worthwhile not just because of the quantifiable economic benefits – important though they are – but because of the spin-offs it generates. The economist Amartya Senhas pointed outthese intangible gains – confidence, ability to engage in political processes, capacity for absorbing and processing information – that create opportunities. In countries where gender equity is deeply entrenched in homes and labour markets, education is a gamechanger.If, as Chapman says, a reduced aid budget is the “new normal”, there are ways of mitigating the pain. The government could alter the balance so that more British spending goes through multilateral organisations, such as the World Bank, which have the financial firepower to make pooled resources go further.It could press harder for a comprehensive debt relief agreement that would allow poor countries to devote more of their spending to education. But that has to start with a different approach. This is not just about the money; it is also about a mindset that appears to have forgotten that encouraging girls to go to school is good for health, good for growth, good for poverty reduction, good for gender equality and good for the self-esteem of women.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsAidOpinionChildrenWomenLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Last week Fletcher observed: “For more than 10 weeks, nothing has entered Gaza – no food, medicine, water or tents.” He pleaded to Israel: “Lift this brutal blockade. Let humanitarians save lives.”Australia demands Israel allow aid into Gaza, stating ‘the population faces starvation’ in joint statementRead moreThe UK has now announced asuspension of trade talkswith Israel after fierce condemnation of the situation by the prime minister, Keir Starmer, in the House of Commons. Using language not used since the latest Gaza conflict began, the British foreign secretary, David Lammy, called Israel’s further planned major military incursion into Gaza “morally unjustifiable, wholly disproportionate and utterly counterproductive”. He told MPs: “We must call this what it is. It is extremism. It is dangerous. It is repellent. It is monstrous.”But in Australia the Albanese government has been remarkably silent. Other than joining in a 19 Mayjoint statement with like-minded aid partners, there has been little direct comment from Australia on the latest developments. On Wednesday, Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong,released a statementlabelling UN reports on the risks to babies and children “horrifying”. But despite joining the 19 May statement, Australia did not join aseparate statementsigned by Canada, the UK and France warning Israel against expanding its military campaign in Gaza, threatening “further action”, including targeted sanctions.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailGiven how volatile the Israel-Hamas conflict had become in Australia, and how it was a potential flashpoint during the election, it might have been understandable that the government was largely silent on these issues before 3 May. But now, having been returned to office with a strengthened mandate and no apparent evidence that Labor’s position on Gaza had damaged it electorally, the Albanese government could speak out more forcefully on these issues both domestically and internationally. Most recently more attention has been given to the situation in Ukraine and Australia’s ongoing support for efforts to combat Russia’s aggression and to end that war.How was the current humanitarian situation in Gaza allowed to develop? Israel’s latest blockade of Gaza began after the breakdown in March of the January ceasefire that had been negotiated with Hamas. From March until this week no humanitarian aid was permitted to enter Gaza. The result was that in addition to Israel’s continuing military assault on the territory, the civilian population only had small reserves of food, which gradually became exhausted.The images of people in Gaza pleading for whatever food they could secure eventually became too much even for Donald Trump. At the conclusion of his Middle East diplomatic and trade tour last week, Trump commented on 16 May: “We’re looking at Gaza. And we’re going to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving.” That statement appears to have been the catalyst for others to act.Following the gathering of various world leaders in Rome on Saturday for Pope Leo’s inauguration mass, the wider international community has begun to speak out, no doubt also encouraged by the pope’s comments that “we cannot forget our brothers and sisters who are suffering because of war” and his direct reference to the situation in Gaza. In quick succession, on 19 May a joint statement was issued by Canada, France and the UK, calling on Israel to allow aid to flow into Gaza, followed the same day by a “Joint donor statement on humanitarian aid to Gaza”.Australia joined with 22 other states and EU representatives making clear: “Food, medicines and essential supplies are exhausted. The population faces starvation.” It was bluntly stated: “We have two straightforward messages for the Government of Israel: allow a full resumption of aid into Gaza immediately and enable the UN and humanitarian organisations to work independently and impartially to save lives, reduce suffering and maintain dignity.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many more are in a queue awaiting a further relaxation of the blockade.It would appear clear that the international diplomatic and political pressure on Israel had reached a point that it could no longer be ignored. This was despite the fact that the UN security council in New York has largely been just an observer. US congressional influence on Israel should be acknowledged, with Benjamin Netanyahu stating that “senators” who are friends of Israel had expressed their concerns.Wong has consistently advanced a principled position on one aspect of the war in Gaza, which is that Australia respects Israel’s right to defend itself but how it does so matters. Starving a civilian population is a war crime and can be evidence of the commission of genocide. That clearly is something that matters.Australia, as a friend of Israel and supporter of international law and the rules-based international system, needs to make its position on these issues crystal clear – directly in Canberra and in Jerusalem.Donald Rothwell is professor of international law at the Australian National UniversityExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionAustralian foreign policyIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

While all signs point to more rates cuts to come, unfortunately the RBA remains wedded to the idea that we need more people to lose their jobs in order to keep inflation low.You might have missed it, but the inflation fight is now officially over.After every board meeting going backto October 2022, the RBA has issued a statement that ended by saying the bank remains “resolute in its determination to return inflation to target”.On Tuesday the bank changed the language, endingits statementby noting that “the Board is focused on its mandate to deliver price stability and full employment and will do what it considers necessary to achieve that outcome”.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIt is no longer resolute about returning inflation to target, because inflation nowiswithin the 2% to 3% target range.Suddenly the RBA has rediscovered that it is supposed to also care about full employment. That might seem good for those looking for work, but unfortunately, the bank view of full employment is that we need more people unemployed.For you see, the RBA continues to obsess about a “tight labour market”. It does this because it believes unemployment of about 4% will probably cause wages to rise and then prices will follow.You would think after nearly three years of being wrong, the bank might start to question its economics. But no.Australia’s wage growth remains solid. But now the recovery needs to be sustained | Greg JerichoRead moreThree years of waiting for a wages-price spiral that has never come.Back inMay 2022, when the RBA first began to increase interest rates, the bank warned that “in a tight labour market, an increasing number of firms are paying higher wages to attract and retain staff”.Unemployment at the time was 3.9% and the RBA wanted it to rise to 4.5%. Private sector wages were growing at 2.7% while inflation was more than double that at 6.1%. We were also just halfway through a record 30 months of prices growing faster than wages.It took until the end of 2023 for wages to grow faster than inflation.Throughout all of that time, unemployment was never above 4% and in the 15 months since December 2023, it has been above 4.1% for just one month.What has happened in these past 15 months? Did wages rise with prices following? Nope. Wage growth fell. Inflation fell.Does the RBA realise they got it wrong? Oh lord no!In its statement on Tuesday the RBA board stuck to its guns, saying that while there was weak demand in the economy, “at the same time, a range of indicators suggest that labour market conditions remain tight”.Despite this, in theMay statement on monetary policy, also released on Tuesday, the RBA predicts underlying inflation and wage growth will be lower than it did in its February statement:If the graph does not display, click hereThis means the RBA now predicts real wages will only grow around half a percent over the next two years:If the graph does not display, click hereOne would think a tight labour market might result in better wages than that!skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Oops. Don’t blame us, blame the data!The RBA now forecasts slower household spending growth for the next 18 months than it did in February:If the graph does not display, click hereHeck, the RBA now predicts theAustralian economyas a whole will grow slower over the next two years that it thought was the case just three months ago:If the graph does not display, click hereSo, the RBA expects wage growth to be slower, household spending to be lower, the economy to be weaker than it did when it kept rates steady in April, but also that it was not wrong to keep rates steady!Cripes, I’d have to see how bad things get for them to actually admit fault.And here’s the kicker – the RBA is happy with everything slowing.In its statement, the RBA noted that cutting rates “will make monetary policy somewhat less restrictive”. That means it still thinks interest rates are slowing the economy, just not by as much as before. Why on earth would you want the economy to grow slower than it is now?The market, for its part, thinks the RBA will have to wake up soon. After the April meeting, the market predicted the cash rate might be cut to 3.35% by the end of the year; now it thinks there is very good chance of it being cut to 3.1%.If the graph does not display, click hereThe RBA admits inflation is under control; now it is time for it to truly focus on delivering full employment rather than sticking to its outdated view that we need more people out of work to stop wages from rising.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsInterest ratesReserve Bank of AustraliaUnemploymentcommentShareReuse this content"

To understand why, visit BirminghamSharon GrahamMinisters are targeting low-paid bin workers while cosseting billionaires. Supporters could not be more disillusionedSharon Graham is the general secretary of UniteWed 21 May 2025 10.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 21 May 2025 12.13 EDTShareSix months ago, it was a stirring, a mood felt in many workers’ meetings, on picket lines and doorsteps. What started as disappointment in Labour is now giving way to anger for many British workers and their communities. “Aren’t Labour supposed to be for workers?” is a line I hear daily now. Most recently, this sentiment has been felt in Birmingham, where bin workers for the Labour-run city council have been onindefinite strikesince 11 March.These workers woke up one morning to be told they would lose up to a quarter of their pay – what Unite believes to be up to £8,000. This is “fire-and-rehire” by any other name. Bin lorry drivers are now being told they are next in line to lose the same amount in pay. What makes this scandal all the more egregious is that it is being perpetrated by a Labour council – enthusiastically backed by a Labour government. Onebin worker saidthis government “might be Labour in name, but it isn’t Labour in nature”.That specific is mirrored in much more general conceptions. Labour voters can’t believe that this government would, with almost its first act,cut the winter fuel allowancefor pensioners, regardless of theU-turn it has now made. Then it attacked those on welfare benefits. Why would a Labour administration target some of the country’s most vulnerable people instead of making the rich pay more, through a real wealth tax? Unite research shows that the assets of the richest 50 families in the UK areworth £500bn. That’s more than the wealth of a third of Britain. A 1% tax on the richest 1% would raise £25bn. Labour in name but not in nature is right.And nothing is more symbolic of Labour’s disconnection from its core mission than the catastrophe of the Birmingham bin strike. Angela Rayner, Labour MPs, and the leader of Birmingham city council, John Cotton, who incidentally has not attendedone single negotiationon the bin strike, have spent weeks, if not months, demanding that our members should simply accept “the fair and reasonable offer on the table”. The problem is there isn’t one.I’ve seen this charade play out week after week since the strike began: Unite decision-makers are in the room with a group of council employees who clearly do not have the power to make any decisions. Hence, there have been no real negotiations and certainly no settlement of the dispute.When Acas conciliation was suggested, I said I would be there in person and that I expected the leader of the council to do the same. After all, he had said in public just days before that “nobody needs to lose any pay” – surely we should have been in touching distance of a deal? But Cotton, once again, did not turn up to the talks, sending Joanne Roney, the managing director of the city council instead, who introduced herself as a decision-maker. I asked for a copy of the “fair and reasonable offer”, but yet again, none was produced.Both Rayner and Cotton have cited lump sums in the thousands being put on the table, together with moves that would result in no loss of pay. None of this was seen at Acas. Nonetheless, the talks began, and a “ballpark” deal was discussed, one that could finally be taken back to workers to ballot. That was on the 6 May. Roney said she would send a written draft by 8 May, but at the time of writing, we have yet to receive the offer. A simple written offer dictating terms.Dysfunction worthy of the House of Windsor: the real reasons rubbish is piling up in Birmingham | Kate KnowlesRead moreSo why the delay? The government’s own commissioners – who have beenin placesince just after the council effectively declared itself bankrupt in 2023 – are now apparently blocking the deal, despite Rayner previously claiming central government has “no part in the decision-making of the dispute”. Roney is reportedly being prevented from putting in writing what we discussed at conciliation unless they agree to it. Of course, this is what Unite has been saying all along: Birmingham city council’s decision-makers are simply not in the room.In 35 years of negotiating huge disputes, I have never seen such a shambles. Our members can see through Labour’s spin. How can a Labour council be doing this to their own workers? What happened to the “change” promised by Starmer?Make no mistake, these workers have the full backing of Unite. Losing up to a quarter of their pay means many won’t be able to pay mortgages or rent, or cover other basic living costs. This cannot be allowed to happen.How can a Labour council and a Labour government preside over these pay cuts and say with a straight face that they are the party of workers? The recent local election results are a warning to Labour that the anger is becoming more widespread. The party needs to change course; driving “further and faster” while you are heading for a cliff doesn’t usually end well.Sharon Graham is the general secretary of UniteExplore more on these topicsBirminghamOpinionIndustrial actionPublic services policyLocal governmentcommentShareReuse this content"

Benjamin Netanyahu’s government recently announced its intention to reoccupy Gaza yet again, and called up Israeli reservists. In tandem, the illegal expansion of settlements and violence in the West Bank continues unabated. And as part of a tactic to bring pressure to bear on Hamas to release the remaining hostages held in Gaza, Israelhalted the delivery of humanitarian aidinto Gaza for two months, leading to widespread starvation and brutal conditions.In reaction, the UK, France and Canada issued a joint statement expressing a strong rebuke of Israel’s war effort. The UK’s foreign secretary, David Lammy, also announced afreeze on trade discussionswith Israel, and the imposition of sanctions on settlers and organisations involved in West Bank violence. This reproach followed the Dutch foreign minister’s call to review theEU-Israel association agreement. The move, supported by a large number of EU states, criticised Israel’s conduct of war and could lead to sanctions. Spain’s prime minister went even further, calling Israel agenocidal state. Strikingly, even the staunchly pro-Israeli Trump administration is also taking its distance from Netanyahu’s government, with Donald Trump avoiding a stop in Israel on his Middle East tour. The US vice-president, JD Vance, has also chosen to delay a visit to Israel, suggesting that the administration wants to dissociate itself from the optics of this unending war.The growing chorus of international condemnation reflects a decisive shift in global attitudes, but without more stringent efforts – including further sanctions, external steps to recognise Palestinian statehood and greater alignment by Israel’s opposition – it is unlikely that Netanyahu and his rightwing coalition will be derailed from their military campaign against Hamas and territorial expansionist plans.Netanyahu is certainly caught between growing domestic and international pressure, but as of now neither is sufficient to force a change in course or calculus. His coalition of rightwing partners continue to see the war in Gaza as an opportunity under the guise of national security to expand Israel’s territorial claims. Netanyahu himself, seeking to stay in power through 2026, has lashed out against Europe and the UK,arguingthat Israel is at the helm of a fight between “civilisation and barbarism”.EU to review trade relations with Israel over ‘untenable’ situation in Gaza, says top diplomat – as it happenedRead moreInside Israel opposition is mounting. The continued captivity of Israeli hostages in Gaza has triggered mass protests, with families and civil society groups demanding immediate action. Polls show that67% of Israeliswant an end to the conflict and the hostages brought home. Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s push for controversial judicial reforms has reignited protests over what many view as an erosion of democratic checks and balances. His attempt todismissthe Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar prompted a rare legal confrontation, with the supreme court stepping in, showcasing tensions between the government and the security establishment. Political challengers such as the former prime minister, Naftali Bennett, and the Democratic party leader, Yair Golan, are gaining momentum among voters disillusioned by the government’s war strategy and domestic agenda. Still, a serious challenge to Netanyahu’s grip on power will require a more unified and future-oriented opposition coalition.An opportunity for further international pressure that moves beyond rhetoric lies ahead. TheSaudi-French conference on Palestineat the UN headquarters in New York next month marks a potentially pivotal moment. The conference aims to reinvigorate multilateral engagement on Palestinian statehood and coordinate international responses to the crisis in Gaza. With148 countrieshaving already recognised Palestine as a state, the event can be a platform for additional countries, particularly those in Europe, to follow suit. France has hinted at the possibility of announcing its recognition of Palestinian statehood during the conference. The UK is also considering supporting this move.Israel-Gaza war live: one-week-old baby amongst 45 people killed in Gaza strikes as UN warns aid still being blockedRead moreSaudi Arabia normalising relations with Israel, which has conventionally been seen as the big incentive to end the war and integrate Israel into the regional neighbourhood, is formallyoff the tableuntil Israel recognises Palestinian statehood. Positioning itself as a leading regional voice, Saudi Arabia is leveraging the multilateral conference to reassert Arab support for a two-state solution. As global frustration with the status quo intensifies, the Saudi-French initiative could signal a shift toward greater diplomatic recognition of Palestinian rights and a renewed push for a negotiated settlement.Israel stands at a crossroads, increasingly isolated on the world stage and facing mounting isolation and internal unrest. Yet, condemnation alone will not alter the trajectory of Netanyahu’s government. What’s needed now is coordinated, strategic external and internal action that can finally force a shift away from endless war and toward a path of accountability, justice and peace.Sanam Vakil is director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa programmeExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionGazaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuDavid LammyMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Though, it is very in keeping with a nuclear Australia to keep a radioactive policy around because you have no idea how to safely dispose of it.1:59Coalition split: the Nationals are breaking up with the Liberal party after election defeat – videoMy favourite quote on the incident came from the Nationals Senate leader, Bridget McKenzie, who said “I’m genuinely blown away that we are prepared to do this for the right reasons.”This feels true to me. I could imagine them doing this for petty reasons, perhaps even outwardly stupid reasons, but principles of any kind are so rare to find that part of you has to respect the move, provided it’s the part of you incapable of adding up numbers.Still, it’s at least a stand to take. We believe in our principles and if we can’t get them done together then we will go ourselves and stand even less of a chance of getting them done.You’d better give me what I want or I will shoot myself right in the foot.The Liberal party was only given half an hour to prepare for the split to be announced to the press, hardly enough time to take the traditional post-breakup measures of booking a trip to Japan and flooding your Instagram stories with inspirational quotes about loyalty and finding your path in life.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

John Howard emerged like the Ghost of Christmas Past to lash both parties for their misdeeds, and made sure to remark about the time that he almost split theCoalitionbecause he was having so much success, and the Liberal party was going so well, and everyone loved him so much – does that help you? Can you relate to that?Senator Matt Canavan,fresh from his own leadership challenge, was stood up on breakfast television by the deputy Liberal leader, Ted O’Brien. Later, O’Brien claimed the two were good friends and would happily appear together – an unfortunate misstep as “unwilling to appear with Matt Canavan” was the most relatable policy the Liberal had put forward in months.Now, as with all breakups, you don’t want to say anything too harsh in case the couple gets back together in a few days. I will not speculate on rumours that the Liberals might start seeing that nice Teal party from work, even if they do seem to have a lot in common.The only advice I will give is the traditional breakup advice.

These are all contributing factors, but there’s another, more hidden cause that isn’t talked about enough: abuse, especially during childhood. I recall Chad Varah, the founder of Samaritans, reflecting that there were many things that drove people to call the charity’s suicide helpline. But abuse was a prominent reason.Abuse isn’t an easy subject to raise or talk about. It brings up issues of gender dynamics – a colleague studying global sexual abuse told me: “The vast majority of perpetrators are men; the victims are equally boys and girls.” These are hard issues to think about, harder still to discuss and difficult to address. They challenge notions of safety, trust, family and community. But if we want to make progress in addressing poor mental health, we have to start here – with the truths we’d rather avoid.The internet has fundamentally changed our world. Where once we worried about a child walking home from school alone or sleeping over at a friend’s house, now we have the entire online world to contend with. Grooming and exploitation no longer happen only in person – they happen on smartphones, in video games and through tablets handed over to keep kids entertained. And too often, the adults meant to protect children are far behind.Recent research fromChildlight, a child safety charity at the University of Edinburgh, has shown a steep rise in online grooming cases. It estimates that about 830,000 young people worldwide are at risk of social exploitation and abuse every day. This includes explicit photo sharing, sexual extortion, solicitation, deepfake images, pornography and grooming. Social media platforms, messaging apps and multiplayer games have become common avenues for abusers to target youngsters. They’ve been designed to be attractive and addictive to children, but largely without their safety in mind. And that puts the burden of protection unfairly on parents, many of whom don’t understand the risks – or aren’t even aware that they exist.Take Roblox, a platform marketed as a child-friendly virtual playground. Behind its colourful, blocky graphics and simple games lies a reality far less innocent.A recent studyexamining interactions within the game found that through its open chat features, users were able to initiate contact with children as young as five, and were able to potentially speak with them over time before moving to other, less public platforms. Children could also see and hear sexual and suggestive content while playing various games. The researchers found that a test avatar registered to an adult could ask for a five-year-old’s test avatar’s Snapchat details on the platform. Just last month, aCalifornia manwas accused of kidnapping and sexual conduct with a 10-year-old he met on Roblox. The surface looks benign. The danger lies underneath.One thing that should be noted, too, is that even if physical contact never occurs, exposure to traumatic or sexually inappropriate content can still leavelasting mental scars. The internet and social media in particular have made it easier to access this kind of content, even if a child is never contacted by a coercive individual. Online abuse can take many forms, from exposure to sexual images and videos to inappropriate sexual and non-sexual language, extortion and solicitation.In 2023, an estimated 19% of children aged 10 to 15 in England and Wales exchanged messages with someone online whom they had never met in real life.Nearly a third of eight- to 17-year-olds who game online saythey chat to strangerswhile gaming.The vast majority of those interactions will be harmless, but when bad things do happen, many children feel isolated or unsupported: only half of children in a survey in Englandtoldtheir parents or teacher about harmful content they had seen online.The same shame, confusion, fear and guilt that silences victims of abuse in the real world also mutes those suffering from exposure virtually.That silence can be deadly.Studies have shownthat children who are groomed or coerced online often suffer from anxiety, depression, PTSD and suicidal thoughts. According to Samaritans, children and young people with histories of abuse are at far higher risk of self-harm and suicide. Varah’s reflections underscore this: abuse, especially when unaddressed, can derail an entire life. But awareness is the first step towards prevention. We need to remove the stigma around abuse so that survivors of any age can speak up.Timid new online safety laws won’t prevent more tragedies like the death of my daughter Molly | Ian RussellRead moreWe also need to better understand how quickly the landscape of risk is evolving. This means having open conversations with children, not just once but regularly. It means teaching them that they can talk to us about anything they see or experience online, without fear or shame.Tech companies need to be regulated by government to be accountable for creating safer environments. Just leaving it to voluntary initiatives doesn’t seem to be enough.On 25 July, the Online Safety Act will beimplemented in Britain, with clear safety rules for platforms to protect young people from harmful content, online abuse and sexual material. It is an important step forward in treating this issue with the urgency it deserves – just as we would with any other public health threat.While Samaritans continues its vital work supporting those in crisis, we owe it to our children to intervene earlier, to prevent that crisis from occurring in the first place. If we want to protect the mental health of young people, we need to start where the damage begins – and that means looking directly at the hard truths, online and off.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s what young women are up toCas MuddeThere is an opportunity staring centre-left parties in the face – if they reject the male gaze distorting our politicsWed 21 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 21 May 2025 08.05 EDTShare‘The boys are alt-right.” Thisseems to bethe new consensus on far-right politicspropagatedin numerous articles and podcasts. But the media’s obsessive focus on the young men allegedly fuelling the rise of the far right isn’t just empirically flawed – it misses a much more significant shift in public opinion among young people. While many surveys show a large gender gap in support of far-right parties and policies, it isyoung womenwho stand out as the more politically interesting demographic, as they are turning in ever greater numbers towards the left.The idea that young people in general, and young men in particular, disproportionately support the far right has been around for a while.In a classic 2012 study, the German political scientist Kai Arzheimer characterised the “typical” voter of far-right parties in Europe as “male, young(ish), of moderate educational achievementand concerned about immigrants and immigration”.It is frequently used to explain the rise of Donald Trump, while in Europe there has been an explosion of articles claiming that young people, particularlyyoung men, are “driving far-right support”. But is the recent rise of Europe’s far right truly due to the disproportionate support of young men? And are young people really becoming more rightwing?Levels of support for far-right parties among young people are indeed higher than ever before in many cases. Butarticleson this subject often fail to mention that far-right parties have increased their supportoverall,and that support among other age groups is at least as high. A study of the 2024 European electionseven showedlower support for far-right parties among young voters (aged 16-29) than among older voters. More interestingly, while young men voted for far-right parties in similar numbers to older men, young women voted less for far-right parties than older women.Mostresearchshows that young people – both women and men – hold more progressive values than previous generations. While there is alarger gender gapamong young people, the main reason for this is not a rightwing turn among young men but a sharp leftwing turn among young women, as Gaby Hinsliff noted in a perceptiverecent columnfor the Guardian.That the media chooses nevertheless to focus on young men illustrates the male gaze that continues to dominate society, which not only means that whatever men do or think is deemed inherently important and worthy of both academic and political attention, but also sets men as the norm. This ends up strengthening the far right’s political prospects: given that men are the norm, what they supposedly do or think is deemed “normal”, which means that all politicians should come up with “commonsense” policies to cater to them.To be clear, “the boys” may not be not “alt-right” but they are also not all right. Many studies have found that young menstrugglein terms of education, mental health and work. And politically, researchshowsthat while young men do not vote more for far-right parties than older men, they doconsidervoting for far-right parties in much larger numbers. Moreover, they are moresusceptibleto “modern sexism” – denying that women continue to be discriminated against and rejecting demands for increased gender equality.We obsess over the angry young men going Reform. But what of the anxious young women going Green? | Gaby HinsliffRead moreOf course it is important to better understand these developments, particularly given the threat that the far right poses to liberal democracy. But this should not lead us to minimise or even ignore the more pronounced generational shift to the left. That young women are more supportive of abortion rights or feminism than young men and even older women should not be that surprising, given that these issues affect them more directly and personally. Yet they are alsomore concernedabout the environment and moresupportiveof redistribution and a larger role for the state. Why is this?This is not just an academic question: it is a political opportunity. Centre-left parties have followed the male gaze into chasing an outdated interpretation of the “working-class” voter (narrowly defined as white men with rightwing sociocultural views). This electoral strategy pushes politics further to the right. Moreover, as decades of academic research haveshown, it serves mainly to help far-right parties while hurting centre-left parties, which end up losing (young, female) progressive voters and barely gaining the (male) reactionary voters they court.Focusing on the priorities and values of female voters (such as actions to fight the climate crisis and strengthen the welfare state), rather than pandering to the reactionary politics of the far right,would have two major advantages for progressive politics in general and for leftwing parties in particular. First, it would transform the political debate: we would talk more about combating the climate crisis, for instance, and spend less time demonising immigrants. Second, it gives young women a reason to come out and vote in larger numbers, which issignificant, as “young women abstain from voting more than young men do”. The opportunity is there for the taking.Cas Mudde is the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, and author ofThe Far Right TodayExplore more on these topicsWomenOpinionMenYoung peopleEuropeClimate crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

Then the Nationals went nuclearWhat does the split mean for Australian politics? – Full Story podcastTue 20 May 2025 21.08 EDTLast modified on Wed 21 May 2025 02.51 EDTShareThe Coalitioncame unstuckover four policy areas: nuclear power, the $20bn regional Australia future fund, strengthening the universal service obligation in the provision of telecommunications, and increased powers to force Coles and Woolworths to divest.TheNational partyroom required the Liberal party to commit to them as a condition of a renewed Coalition agreement, and Sussan Ley would not. She had promised her party a root-and-branch review of its policies and did not want this pre-empted.Talking toDavid Littleproudon the ABC’s 7.30 program, Sarah Ferguson described these policies as minor and was puzzled as to why they had blown up such a longstanding political alliance. But each is on the fault line between the Liberals and the Nationals over the role of government provision. Each advocates a more active role for government than many Liberals feel comfortable with.1:59Coalition split: the Nationals are breaking up with the Liberal party after election defeat – videoThe policy theCoalitiontook to the election was for seven nuclear power stations to be built by the government. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has now suggested the more modest aim of lifting the ban on nuclear power to make it possible for the private sector to build the plants but this is not yet the party’s settled policy and some, including Matt Canavan, are holding out for government to take the initiative and make the investment.Putting aside questions about the feasibility of nuclear power, the Coalition’s policy was at odds with the Liberals’ commitment to the market and private investment and their belief that government should only supply those things the private sector cannot, and should not compete with an efficient private sector. So it is not surprising that theLiberal party, embarking on a review of its policies, does not want to be held to this.The great Coalition split: how Littleproud’s irresistible force met Ley’s immovable objectRead moreThe purpose of the regional future fund is to provide government-funded infrastructure and services to rural and regional Australia, especially in areas where the population is too thin to support private provision. The National party and its predecessor, the Country party, have always argued that people living in Australia’s rural and regional areas are entitled to the same levels of service as those available to city dwellers, despite these being much more expensive to deliver, and that if the market won’t deliver them then the government should.The universal service obligation dates back to federation when the postmaster general’s department was given monopoly control of postal, telegraphic and telephonic communications, with the obligation to provide these to the country and regions. During the 1980s and 90s the Nationals fought hard against the privatisation ofAustralia Postand Telecom. They lost but they did succeed in ensuring the continuation of this obligation in the two living descendants of the PMG.Australia Post is obliged to deliver letters for a standard price to anywhere in Australia, regardless of losses on delivery. Telstra is obliged to ensure that standard telephone services and payphones are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they work or live. The demand now is that this be extended to mobile services. The divestiture policy is newer but it too requires the government to interfere with the workings of the market.Australia’s three foundational parties, Liberal, Labor and Country/National, differ in the balance each strikes between public and private provision, between the role of the state and the market in the distribution of the nation’s resources. Where the Liberals have tilted to private and the market, Labor has tilted to public and the state. And so has the Country/National party.It was once common to talk of Country party socialism. Although farmers hated the unions, they shared with Labor a faith in government to compensate for the failures of the market and provide them with a fair share of the country’s wealth.That is why I called my 2011 Quarterly Essay, on country and city in Australia,Fair Share.It is quite understandable that the Liberals do not want to pre-empt their forthcoming policy review by committing to policies that give such a large role to government.This fault line between the Nationals and the Liberals has always been there, albeit obscured of late by the culture wars in which both parties espoused adherence to family values and traditional settler nationalism. The Liberals’ devastating loss on 3 May has turned it into a rift.Judith Brett is a political historian and biographer, and an emeritus professor of politics at La Trobe University.

And when fate parts them in the years after, their love story becomes something more poignant.They are farm-boy Lionel from Kentucky, played byPaul Mescal– a sonorous, stately voiceover at the very beginning reveals him to have perfect pitch and synaesthesia, the ability to comprehend music in taste and colour as well as sound – but these abilities are not actually revealed in the film.The other man is David, played by Josh O’Connor, a man from a more privileged background, without Lionel’s instinctive music talent and destined for a college instructor’s job.View image in fullscreenImpeccable … Josh O'Connor in The History of Sound.Photograph: Gwen Capistran/Fair Winter LLCMescal and O’Connor are of course very talented actors and they never do anything other than an impeccable professional job but they have each shown more passion in, variously, Andrew Haigh’sAll of Us Strangersand Francis Lee’sGod’s Own Country.This is a film about music as well as love, but the folk songs, for which Mescal and O’Connor gamely fabricate enthusiasm, sound like museum pieces kept under glass and the love story itself feels as if it is kept under glass. The accents and line-readings feel like painstaking expert reconstructions rather than the real thing and the love scenes are at half-throttle – as if they are there to be remembered sadly rather than experienced ecstatically in the here and now.There are, I concede, well-judged moments of tenderness and loneliness in the long aftermath to the long goodbye – in Lionel’s lonely wanderings in Italy and England, and in the revelation involved in his meeting with the woman that David married after their idyllic Maine summer. And there is to be a kind of final meeting between the two, involving that wax cylinder technology, perhaps inspired by a famous ending by Graham Greene.Everything here is out of the top drawer of production value: but it never really comes to passionate life.The History of Sound premiered atCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalPaul MescalJosh O'ConnorFestivalsDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

And, OK, how can you really prove that?” they smile. “But I can say, at least for myself, it has opened up a new level of awareness and self-compassion over the years.”We know music is powerful: we turn to songs to feel comforted, to boost our energy, to appreciate beauty and so much more. But what about the frequencies; the actual soundwaves vibrating the air, our eardrums and our bodies – how do they affect us? From promoting deep relaxation to the use of noise as a weapon, there is a wide range of claims, and evidence, for the impact of sound. It moves us emotionally and literally, a theme that’s explored in a new exhibition at the Barbican in London called Feel the Sound. “The idea that the world is made up of vibrations and frequencies is something we don’t necessarily think about a lot of the time,” says Luke Kemp, head of creative programming at Barbican Immersive. “The big idea is how sound is more than an audio experience. We can think of our whole body as a listening device,” he says.View image in fullscreenAn installation at Feel the Sound.Photograph: © Thomas Adank/Barbican CentreTake Jan St Werner’s Vibraceptional Plate installation, which visitors can stand on and then explore the resonance of their own body, and a film by deaf percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie discussing the rhythms inside us and how she experiences sound. There’s a holographic choral experience, a playground of multisensory musical instruments, and for the finale, an installation in the Barbican’s car park featuring souped-up cars with big sound systems; part sculpture, part dancefloor.Ifekoya’s piece, called Resonant Frequencies, is an immersive soundscape using frequencies believed to be healing. Visitors will be able to sit or lie on a vibrating stage to hear and feel the sound, as well as see its effect on a pool of water at the centre of the room. As we chat, Ifekoya tells me about other supposedly powerful frequencies, such as 174Hz (roughly the F below middle C). “This one reportedly works with the internal system, the organs, to regenerate and repair.” They show me a frequency board (a special type of circuit board) emitting an inaudible 7.83Hz, one of the frequencies produced by electromagnetic waves in the Earth’s lower ionosphere. “This is the frequency my home is grounded at,” says Ifekoya. Has it had a positive effect? “My plants are thriving,” they laugh.Anyone who has found themselves next to the bass bins in a club will know the physical power of sound is real. “You feel the low frequencies hitting and vibrating your body,” says electronic musician (with a PhD in computational biology) Max Cooper, who has plenty of experience seeing the visible effect of his music on crowds of clubbers when he plays around the world. In the piece Cooper has made for Feel the Sound, called Reflections of Being, visitors can get some of that subwoofer experience, “the full body massage” as he puts it, without fear of hurting their ears, via tactile benches in the installation space which make no sound but shake instead. “I’m a big fan of tactile sound,” Cooper says, pointing to a tactile transducer–or bass shaker–fixed to the back of his studio chair, which allows him to feel low-frequency vibrations. “I do a lot of low frequency harmonies and when you play on a big sound system in a big venue, you feel that transfer directly into your body.”Cooper started the project by asking the public how they were feeling – the question was: “What do you want to express that you feel you can’t in every day life” – and then created music in response. The replies he got were “beautiful, scary, intense, funny,” he says, and had a powerful effect on him. He felt a responsibility to do justice to the people who’d trusted him with their honesty. “Because, you know, it’s fine to talk about tactile benches, but ultimately it’s the emotion that we can communicate that’s important.”View image in fullscreen‘We can think of our whole body as a listening device’ … Jan St Werner’s Vibraceptional Plate, 2024.Photograph: Sanja Bistričić SrićaThat intersection of science with sensation and emotions is exactly where multidisciplinary designer Robyn Landau works, translating academic insight from neuroscience into creative projects, often aimed at improving wellbeing. For the installation Your Inner Symphony, her company Kinda Studios has collaborated with designer Alex Jenkins from Nexus Studios to make the invisible inner workings of our bodies tangible. Visitors will go to a “sensing station” and put their hand on a sensor to measure heart rate, heart rate variability and galvanic skin response (ie how much you’re sweating). Then, once they’ve moved through the exhibition, they’ll be able to test themselves again to see what’s changed and their readings will be translated into images and sound.It’s based on the idea that “emotions live as physiological sensations inside of our bodies”, says Landau. “And these physiological changes are what shape our feelings.” It’s very well documented, she says, that sound frequencies interact with our brainwaves, but researchers are now learning how frequencies interact with the way the body maps emotional responses. One study showed that we sense different emotions in specific parts of our bodies, and there is lots of research on entrainment – the way humans naturally sync up with rhythms in music, such as when our heart rates match a musical beat, or when we automatically tap our feet to one.View image in fullscreenPart sculpture, part dancefloor … souped-up cars in the Barbican’s car park.Photograph: © Thomas Adank/Barbican CentreThe science on specific frequencies such as 528Hz is less established, Landau says. “There is some evidence,” she says tentatively. “Not all of it is clinically proven. But just because it’s not proven doesn’t always mean it’s not true. Sometimes we don’t have the tools to be able to measure it properly.” Most current research in that field is focused on largely inaudible, low frequency sound. “This is where we feel stimulated from inside,” says Landau. “There’s lots ofresearch to showthat these low frequency vibrations can effectively make people more tolerant to pain.” She likens it to a cat’s purr when it’s relaxed. (Cats also sometimes purr when they’re stressed to self-soothe – humans might try humming for the same effect.)There is a lot more to learn, but it’s clear that our brains and bodies are constantly responding to the soundworld around us, whether we’re aware of it or not. Sound “drives a cascade of bodily sensations that shape the visceral feeling of being emotionally moved”, says Landau. “I hope that people can come away from the exhibition with a sense of awe about their own body,” she adds, “and how magical a place it really is.”Feel the Sound is at theBarbican, London, from 22 May to 31 AugustExplore more on these topicsInstallationElectronic musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then you see the tattoos’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 21 May 2025 09.36 EDTLast modified on Wed 21 May 2025 12.45 EDTShareMy first trip photographing Americans was in 2015, when I drove 8,000 miles across the country on aHarley-Davidson. I’d spent too long caught up in assignments and wanted to take some time off from commercial and editorial work to follow my own creative urges. America offered an opportunity to explore a landscape I didn’t know, and was far enough away from my home in the Netherlands to ensure it wouldn’t be easy for me to just go back if things got difficult.I think Europeans often don’t understand how tough life in America can be. I wanted to show real, underrepresented people who are just trying to survive, while also drawing attention to how rich their lives can be. At a time when people seem increasingly polarised in their views, my images seek to challenge the assumptions that often divide people, and to focus on the common experiences that connect us.This picture is from a more recent series,American, which I undertook with my husband between 2022 and 2024. Again, I took portraits of people we encountered while driving from state to state and we also recorded interviews and documented their stories on film. I spotted Derek and Quentin from our car as we were driving through Elkhart, Indiana. They were wearing hoodies and their faces were hidden. I don’t know what it is that attracts me to people, it’s just this gut feeling – I see certain people and feel I need to talk to and observe them.So I jumped out of the car and ran towards them. I said something like: “Hey, are you brothers?” They said: “Yeah, yeah.” But they were not really looking at me. I told them I was a photographer and film-maker from Amsterdam, and when they heard the word “Amsterdam” they were suddenly interested. I discovered they were 29-year-old twins who lived nearby in a tent, in woodland behind a friend’s trailer home.They’re unconsciously mirroring one another in the way they’re holding their handsThese boys had never learned how to have a “normal” life – how to organise everything, show up to a job, all the basic things. Their mom has a severe mental health condition and never stays in the same place for long and their dad died of an overdose a couple of years ago. Their grandma had taken care of them until they left and started living on the streets. But they have each other, and if you asked them, they would say they had a good childhood. This was where they felt at ease and wanted to live.If you didn’t know their story, you could look at this picture and think they are maybe runners or cyclists. Their skin is white where it’s been covered by T-shirts but their necks and forearms are tanned, and the colour of their skin and hair is echoed by the orange flowers in the background. Then you see the tattoos – Quentin, on the left, has a little star under his eye. They’re also unconsciously mirroring one another in the way they’re holding their hands. There’s so much going on in this picture that it’s a little confusing. But because of that, you keep staring, and that, for me, is a way to break something open – people who see this photograph are curious and always want to know more about these boys.I use a medium format camera because I love capturing the texture of people’s skin and hair, and the twins were fascinated by that and the other tech we were using – the film camera and sound equipment. They’re really into machines and electronics. You can see in their gaze that they’re communicating with me, their posture is open. That’s how I like to approach these portraits – they’re a collaborative process. I love being in that moment where the subject is as completely focused on me as I’m focused on them and we’re reacting to one another.Even when my work exhausts me, it’s not something I can just park, or detach myself from. I always say that through my photography, I’ve created my own family. Just likeRandy, who I formed a close bond with on that first trip across America and still speak to daily, I’ve stayed in regular contact with Derek and Quentin. They are very dear to me.View image in fullscreenRobin de Puy’s CVBorn:1986, Oostflakkee, the NetherlandsTrained:The Photo Academy, Rotterdam.Influences:“Mary Ellen Mark, Egon Schiele, David Lynch, Richard Avedon, Larry Clark and Harmony Korine (I love Kids and Gummo).

The documentarian prizes honesty above all else, even and especially when it’s unflattering to the parties on camera, while those with the ability to shut down the whole operation by rescinding their permissions might wield it in order to promote an agreeable image of themselves. If the talent calls the shots, you get point-and-shoot exercises in hagiographic brand management, and if the director lacks that diplomatic touch, the film doesn’t get made.‘Don’t be afraid of what you don’t know’: the inimitable genius of Andy KaufmanRead moreVery shortly after the film-maker Matt Wolf began work on Pee-wee As Himself, a three-and-a-half-hour portrait of the artist Paul Reubens airing on Friday night onHBO, he started to wonder if he had met his match in the “dream subject” he had pursued for years. Reubens finally agreed to participate in the project because his desire to set his own record straight dovetailed with Wolf’s cardinal rules of “nuance, complexity and integrity”, but the two nonetheless jockeyed for authorial control over a multiyear process. As their interview sessions stretched on and on to a total of 40 hours, the comedian famed for decentering himself behind his stage-and-screen persona Pee-wee Herman proved a formidable sparring partner in turns playful and distractible, sly and evasive, “taunting and rebelling and procrastinating and blowing off steam”, as Wolf remembers him.“I found him immediately to be incredibly intense and challenging, but also compelling,” Wolf tells the Guardian over Zoom from his home office, the original Pee-wee poster from the early days at the Groundlings (a parting gift from Reubens’s assistant) hanging on the wall behind him. “After our first talk, he said what you see at the beginning of the film: ‘I want to make this documentary myself, everyone’s advising me against it, and I don’t understand why.’ And I told him I wanted to get to know him, and see if he could find a way of working with me. It was thrilling and combative in equal measure.” Wolf came in with the rule of thumb that interview subjects tend to lose steam after five hours, so it’s best to call time around there; Reubens flatly rejected this, and insisted that Wolf would be the one to cry uncle first.The finished product is intimately conversational, not only an excellent representation of the experience of speaking with Reubens, but a cooperative effort to reconcile two approaches and perspectives occasionally at odds. In their time together, Reubens often placed his hand on the wheel, asking for scripts and shot lists for sequences meant to be spontaneous. Wolf did commit to include him in the edit and agree to show him a cut, but “the idea that I, as a documentary film-maker, could come in and take his life as the raw material for my work was alienating and confusing for Paul”, Wolf says. “Which I understand; he lost control of his personal narrative, and he had real trauma left over from that. I was sensitive of that, and at the same time, fiercely protective about my editorial independence.”While shooting, Wolf found his way forward by embracing this push and pull as part of the text, the first time he’d considered incorporating himself into his filmography. This posed a unique challenge when, with an interview scheduled for the following week in summer 2023, Reubens died of the lung cancer he’d kept a secret for the previous six years. “The day Paul died, that night, I started to read the 1,500-page transcript of our interview,” Wolf says. “I spent days doing nothing but reading, seeing all these new connections and significances.”Wolf suddenly found himself the primary custodian of another man’s life story, his newfound lack of disputes attached to a moral obligation to do right by Reubens’s legacy. “I could not drop this ball,” Wolf says. “Every day when I woke up, I was aware that I had to rise to the occasion for this extraordinary responsibility I’d been given.” Reubens died at what seemed like a turning point for the film, just as he and Wolf had broken through a long impasse and reached a resolution to move forward, their final dialogue marked by “assurances I needed to continue on”, as Wolf puts it. “I’m hyper-vigilant about not speaking for Paul, or speculating about things he didn’t tell me. It’s unfair to do that for someone who can’t speak for themselves. There are limits to what we can know about other people.”View image in fullscreenPaul Reubens.Photograph: HBOThe initial version of Pee-wee As Himself duly rehashed the main talking points of Reubens’s life and career: the formative boyhood obsessions that would become kitsch classics to the first generation of Americans reared on irony, the creation of the excitable man-boy Pee-wee Herman, the character’s anarchic stage show that begat widely beloved star vehicles on screens big and small, the reputation-tarnishing arrest for public indecency in an adult movie theater and a trumped-up charge of possession of child sexual abuse images fueled by culture-war grievance. Wolf was thorough, but guarded; “that first-cut was very self-censoring,” he recalls. “Everyone told me to get real.”Wolf’s revisions delved deeper by pulling back the curtain, using the interview as a device to illustrate the slippery, elusive nature of a deeply compartmentalized man. Reubens’s tendency to appear in public as Pee-wee was just one part of a complex pathology oriented around privacy, a veil of secrecy Reubens lifted in the knowledge that his days were numbered. Though widely suspected since he first came to prominence, Reubens confirms his homosexuality for the first time on camera, divulging that he actually went back into the closet after a public relationship with a handsome artist named Guy, who later died of Aids. The revelation that Guy originated what would become Pee-wee’s signature “mmm, [noun]-y!” reaction to food ranks as one of the most devastating details in a film that will emotionally pulverize devotees of Reubens.Though Pee-wee was friend to all – especially icons of queer camp, the guest list on his Christmas special bringing together Cher, kd lang and Zsa Zsa Gabor – Reubens uncomfortably shrugged off any notions of gay sainthood. His return to the closet was in part practically motivated, driven by the shrewd awareness (later proven brutally correct) that America would not accept a homosexual entertaining their precious, impressionable children. But acceptance was always the secret word of the day in the Playhouse, a little lunatic utopia in which kids’ weirdest passions – old-timey pop-culture detritus, janky claymation, humor verging on dada a decade-plus before junior audiences met Spongebob – were nourished and celebrated.View image in fullscreenPaul Reubens in Pee-wee’s Big Adventure.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarIf this tragically unfinished film can be said to draw a conclusion, it’s that the heart of Reubens’s legacy will live there, in the eccentricity and generosity of spirit that made him a hero to so many young oddballs and misfits. Wolf shares the story of a Pee-wee superfan in hospice, who reached out with a plea to see the film before losing her own battle with cancer. (She died two days before our interview, and he’d prefer to keep their “beautiful correspondence” to himself.) At first, Wolf didn’t know too much about Reubens the man beyond a vague awareness of his experimental early days, but he looks back on Pee-wee’s Playhouse as a “significant touchstone” in his youth. “I wouldn’t have been able to put words to it at the time, but I think it was my first encounter with art that I had a visceral reaction to,” he says. “And looking back, I think its message of radical acceptance, nonconformity and creativity, that became part of my DNA, as it did for so many kids and adults.”I know what he means. Though I’d missed the boat on the Playhouse’s initial broadcast run, I grew up as one of the Saturday morning faithful in reruns, enraptured by a show vibrating on a different frequency than everything else. For Wolf, a gay man, some of the resonance came from Reubens’s willingness to meet his audience at eye level with furtively mature humor speaking to queer sensibilities without explicit statement. But his appeal was also more expansive than that, an offbeat light in the darkness of the shrill, dull wasteland that was children’s programming. Before youngsters can put a name to camp, they know how to heed its call, every bit as spellbound by Pee-wee as Reubens was by Howdy Doody back in his day. That inspiration is the most meaningful gift he leaves behind. “The fact that we couldn’t articulate why we felt an affinity for something speaks to how profound its impact was,” Wolf says. “It eludes words, to understand why something changes you as a kid.”Pee-wee As Himself premieres on HBO in the US on 23 May with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsDocumentaryUS televisionTV comedyComedyTelevisionHBOFactual TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some of his early works from this period have been brought together at a small but perfectly formed exhibition, curated by Louis Kasmin, grandson of John Kasmin, the dealer who first spotted Hockney.View image in fullscreenThrums with angry static … Composition (Thrust), 1960, by David Hockney.Photograph: © Royal College of Art. Royal College of Art, LondonAfter leaving the Bradford School of Art, Hockney showed up at the RCA in 1959 ready to kick the art world’s doors in. But this is not the Hockney the world knows now. There is no simplicity, no calm. There are no cool, flat planes of bright colour. Rather, young Hockney was a frantic, angry, tempestuous thing.And he was clearly slightly over-enamoured of the ultra-hip abstract expressionists in New York. These paintings, prints and drawings are full of vicious scribbles, irate marks and tempestuously flung paint. It’s almost bewildering to see the guy known for the precise restraint of A Bigger Splash going all hyper-expressive and emotional.He was also almost unstoppably horny. A vast white phallus plunges into a huge splodge of brown in Erection; another pierces up into a plane of white in Shame. Men embrace chaotically in We Two Boys Clinging Together, while a figure thrums with angry static in Composition (Thrust), the word “queen” angrily scrawled down its back. These are works filled with the excitement of burgeoning and, at the time still illegal, sexuality. Hockney was learning to embrace being a gay man, and the art here is a pretty good indicator of what he spent most of his time doing.Whatever spare hours he had away from this pastime he clearly spent immersing himself in all the modern art wonders London had to offer. It was his first time living in the capital, his first chance to lose himself in what its galleries had to offer.Hockney’s modern aesthetic is so unique, so ubiquitous, so incrediblyhim, that it’s a shock to see such glaringly obvious influences in his work. Twombly-esque scrawls, Bacon-y smudged figures, Rauschenbergian mess, Jasper Johns-like lettering. It’s all a little derivative.Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Nothing here feels like a rip off or cheap copy. Rather, it feels like synthesis, as if Hockney was absorbing all the big hits of modern art of his time, mashing them together and spitting out something new.View image in fullscreenDavid Hockney with Cha Cha Cha, around 1960-61.Photograph: Bridgeman ImagesHockney found himself surrounded by competition, too, including the likes of Derek Boshier, Patrick Caulfield and Allen Jones who would soon help invent pop art. He had to raise his game.And his game was clearly not abstraction, which as this show progresses he largely ditches, and for the better. The prints of his take on A Rake’s Progress are stark, political and confrontational, and then the last two rooms get even more figurative; a giant bespectacled demon (likely Hockney himself) stomps between New York skyscrapers, a woman dances herself into a blur, two semi-nude, barely there figures haunt an empty room, sitting on a filthy mattress. It’s all assured and so confident, bursting with love and sex and partying. It might not be abstract, hard edged experimentation, but it’s still undoubtedly something new.The temptation is to view this show purely as the first steps of an artistic giant, to look for hints in all this dark energy and chaos as to what he’d eventually become. That’s fair enough, but it’s also great art on its own merit, a portrait of youth, excitement, joy, hormones and sheer creative will.In the Mood for Love: Hockney in London, 1960-1963is at Hazlitt Holland-Hibbert, London, until 18 JulyExplore more on these topicsDavid HockneyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The first Celebration Day was held on 26 June 2022, and now it runs on the last bank holiday Monday in May, which this year will be 26 May.Stephen Mangan, Nathaniel Parker and Susan Wokoma were also filmed reading poems at Abbey Road studios in London.

They’re just people’Read moreWilfred Owen and Sheenagh Pugh are among the poets whose works were selected by the actors. Jones, known for his roles in Mr Bates vs the Post Office and Detectorists, picked Portrait of a Romantic by ASJ Tessimond, in memory of his father, who died a year after Jones introduced him to the poem.Poems “were like clothing” to his father, said Jones – he “wanted to live inside” them, and memorised a number of them, including Portrait of a Romantic. “We decided to use the second stanza of this poem on his gravestone”, said Jones. “When I read the poem, inevitably I reflect on my Dad, and the huge influence he’s had on both what I do, and how I feel about what I do.”Bonham Carter chose Don’t Let That Horse in memory of her grandmother, who was known as “Bubbles”. A painter who made “sort of fake Chagalls”, Bonham Carter described her grandmother as an “eternal child” who “always had a sense of play”.View image in fullscreen‘An eternal child’ … Helena Bonham Carter holding a picture with her grandmother, Bubbles.Photograph: Rory Langdon-Down“She died at 89, but frankly she never really grew older emotionally than about seven. A good reminder that no matter how serious it gets, you’ve got to remember to have fun.”Lost loved ones “remain part of our fabric, our internal world”, the actor added. “We need permission to stop – a day in which we can invoke them and remember them, and let them live again through us.” After losing somebody, “you might lose what you were when you were with them. And that relationship needs to carry on, somehow”.The actors worked with Esiri, who compiled365 Poems for LifeandA Poem for Every Day of the Year, to choose their poems. Most of us reach for poetry at significant moments in life, like weddings and funerals, because poems “help us express things that most of us find really difficult to express”, said Esiri.The language of poetry “gives you a path when you’re suffering eviscerating feelings of grief and you’ve lost your hold on the earth and everything’s very very fractured”, she added. The “great poet gives you words, and it’s sort of likeholding your hand across time”.Star pin badges will be on sale at WH Smith stores until 27 June, with proceeds going to charities Mind, the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, Make-A-Wish and Hospice UK. The public are encouraged to share memories of loved ones on social media using the hashtag #ShareYourStar.Parker, who directed the videos, said the project “was a genuinely memorable experience”.“Sometimes with a light touch, sometimes deeply moving, they are small, intimate acts of sharing, whether defiant, mournful or inspiring,” he said.Explore more on these topicsBooksPoems to rememberPoetryHelena Bonham CarterStephen ManganToby JonesAsa ButterfieldnewsShareReuse this content"

The contest was ultimatelywon by Austria’s JJ with Wasted Love.Finland’s Yle Entertainment said: “We will ask the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) whether it is time to update these rules or at least review whether the current rules allow for abuse.” Spain’s public broadcaster called for a “complete review” to avoid “external interference”.Ireland’s RTÉ has requested a breakdown of the numbers, and the Netherlands and Iceland are also among those to have raised issues. Director of the competition, Martin Green, said it is taking the concerns “seriously”.Yuval Raphael performs New Day Will Rise in Basel during Saturday’s Eurovision song contest.Israel’s song, New Day Will Rise, submitted by the Israeli public service broadcaster Kan,comprehensively wonthe public part of the vote, after scoring points from 34 of the 38 national and international phone votes. Its performer, Yuval Raphael, was a survivor of the terror assault on the Nova musical festival.The previous Israeli entry finished second in the public vote, earning fifth place in the 2024 contest. Kan had previously beenforced to change the lyricsof entry October Rain, which was deemed to directly reference the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack inside Israel. Performer Eden Golan instead sung the retitled Hurricane.Public Spotify and YouTube streaming data shows that Raphael’s track lags far behind other competitors in terms of popularity. New Day Will Rise wasthe 19th most popular songfrom this year’s competition on Spotify in the week of the event, yet scored the maximumdouze pointsfrom 13 national public votes.Israeli government social media channelshave been encouraging people to vote for its representative the maximum 20 times permitted. The Israeli embassy in London posted to social media during the final, encouraging people to vote 20 times for Raphael.View image in fullscreenEden Golan rehearsing in Malmö during last year’s contest.Photograph: Leonhard Föger/ReutersThe Israeli marketing appears to encourage people to submit multiple votes without even having listened to the song or watched the show. This is not currently against Eurovision’s rules.Belgium’s broadcaster VRT provided data to community news site Songfestival.be which alsoappeared to showa disparity between numbers of viewers and voters. Their statistics indicated that the number of votes cast from Belgium had increased from 1.3m in 2023, to 2m in 2024 and then 2.2m in 2025. However, the show had only about half as many viewers in 2025 as in 2023, as Belgium did not make the final.Dutch broadcaster AvroTros issued a statement this week saying that it attaches “great importance to the apolitical and binding value of the Eurovision song contest” but that it is “increasingly influenced by social and geopolitical pressures”.The results have delighted some quarters. The Jewish Chronicledescribed the 2025 resultas a “rebuff” to anti-Israeli activists and media pundits, writing that “Eurovision fans ignored the relentless campaigning against the Jewish state”.Ewan Spence, senior editor atESC Insight, which reports on Eurovision all year round, told the Guardian that there are potential issues with any future Israeli victory while the Gaza conflict continues. “If Kan wins the Eurovision song contest under the Israeli flag, it would be expected to host the following year, which would raise significant security challenges.“If the contest had to be hosted elsewhere in partnership, the reputation of Eurovision inside Israel would be damaged, and the co-host broadcaster taking on that challenge would face reputational PR issues.”German broadcaster ARD would most likely be the first port of call for the EBU approaching someone to co-host alongside Israel, the way the UK co-hosted on behalf of Ukraine in Liverpool in 2023. However, Benjamin Netanyahu’s administration, which has beenseeking to privatise Kan, would almost certainly apply pressure for the contest to take place in Israel itself. Broadcasters would be under pressure to boycott a contest hosted or co-hosted by Israel while the conflict in Gaza continued.View image in fullscreenPro-Palestinian demonstrators attend a protest, on the day of the Eurovision song contest final in Basel.Photograph: Christian Hartmann/ReutersSome in the Eurovision community believe the contest has been affected by changes made by the EBU to accommodate Israel’s participation. The volume of the crowd in the arena appears to be mixed lower now, to prevent TV broadcasting boos for Israeli acts or pro-Palestinian slogans, and stricter rules were brought in on fans having flags inside the arena. There wasa security incident during Raphael’s performancethat led to a Eurovision staff member being hit with paint, and on the day of the contest pro-Palestinian demonstrators clashed with police in the centre of host city Basel.Spence said: “If Kan had won Eurovision on Saturday, the song contest would have faced an increased loss of engagement from community media and the wider fanbase.”Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez explicitly called on Israel to be expelled from Eurovision on Monday, directly comparing the situation with that of Russia’s exclusion from international events, saying: “[Russia] had to leave international competitions and could not take part … Therefore Israel shouldn’t either, because what we cannot allow is double standards in culture.”The EBU has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionEuropeTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

He wasarrested in Septemberand has pleaded not guilty.On Wednesday morning, Gerard Gannon, an agent with Homeland Security Investigations who oversaw the March 2024 search of Combs’s Miami Beach home, took the stand forthe second timethis week.Gannon told the court on Tuesday that agents discovered AR-15 rifle parts, high heels, sex toys, lubricants, baby oil and lingerie in the closet of the main bedroom of Combs’s Miami home.On Wednesday, Gannon recalled that agents found a Gucci bag containing an assortment of pills including MDMA tablets, as well as white residue that tested positive for cocaine and ketamine, and other items in a different closet in Combs’s home.Photos shown in court were of items that agents said were found in a hallway closet, including more than 20 bottles of baby oil and lubricant.Gannon testified that agents found a loaded .45 caliber handgun in a suitcase in the guesthouse on the property.Under cross-examination, Gannon said the AR-15-style guns found in Combs’s home were disassembled and thus inoperable.The prosecution then called Dr Dawn Hughes, a forensic and clinical psychologist who specializes in trauma. Hughespreviously testified during the 2022 defamation caseof actors Amber Heard and Johnny Depp.Hughes testified that it was common for victims to remain in abusive relationships because they often feel trapped and that it can take months, or even years, before a victim is able to disclose the abuse to anybody. Trauma victims, she said, typically experience deep feelings of shame, humiliation and degradation.“They don’t want to talk about it,” Hughes said. “They don’t even want to think about it in their own brain.”In abusive relationships, Hughes said there is “almost always love” which creates “an intense psychological bond that creates an attachment with their abuser”.It often takes multiple attempts for victims to leave abusive relationships, Hughes said, before describing a cycle of “returning, and reconciliation, and then returning again” as a common pattern in abusive relationships.In tandem with physical violence, Hughes said abusers frequently use financial control to maintain power and make victims feel trapped. Victims often use drugs and repress memories, she said.Hughes told the court that she was paid $600 an hour for her work as an expert witness and $6,000 for a day of testimony in court.During cross-examination, Combs’s lawyers tried to paint Hughes as a biased expert witness who is being paid by the prosecution.On the stand, Hughes confirmed that she’s never testified in defense of someone accused of a sex crime, explaining to the court that she doesn’t “evaluate offenders”.After Hughes, the government called George Kaplan, a former assistant to Combs, to the witness stand.Kaplan said that he started working for Combs Enterprises in 2013 and that he was promoted in less than a year to Combs’s executive assistant.Kaplan testified that Combs would frequently threaten to fire him, and would say that he only wanted the best employees.Kaplan said that he communicated with Combs daily, and often prepared hotel rooms for him, stocking them with clothes, candles, lubricant, baby oil and more, and would clean them afterward.Kaplan told the court that “protecting” Combs’s public image was “very important”.Court adjourned at about 3pm ET. Kaplan will continue testifying on Thursday morning.On Tuesday, the jury heard froma former assistant to Combs, a male escort and Cassie Ventura’s mother, Regina Ventura, who accused him of blackmail and of assaulting her daughter.On Monday, the jury heard fromsinger Dawn Richardand Kerry Morgan, a former close friend of Ventura’s during her relationship with Combs. Both womentestified that they had witnessedCombs assaulting Ventura.Cassie Ventura spent four days on the stand last week, and testified aboutyears of physical and emotional abuseshe endured from Combs during their 11-year on-again, off-again relationship.Ventura said Combs orchestrated drug-fueled sex performances with male sex workers that he called “freak-offs”, and that hecoerced and blackmailedher into participating.She also alleged that Combs raped her in 2018 after their breakup.Prosecutors have sought to portray Combs as controlling and abusive, and as someone who exerted power over nearly every aspect of Ventura’s life and decisions.Attorneys for Combs have tried to undermine Ventura’s credibility and sought to depict her as a willing and consenting participant in the so-called “freak-offs”.The trial is expected to last seven more weeks. If convicted, Combs could spend the rest of his life in prison.Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsNew YorkHip-hopRapnewsShareReuse this content"

The sister trade associations have called for the government’s comprehensive spending review to dramatically increase public investment, including £500m for infrastructure, and to support itsTheatre for Every Childinitiative which aims to ensure all pupils attend a professional theatre production before leaving school.The organisations’ co-CEOs, Claire Walker and Hannah Essex, said: “Theatres are doing more with less – and the strain is showing. Rising costs, shrinking support and ageing infrastructure are putting the sector under unsustainable pressure. We are seeing world-class organisations forced to cut programmes, delay maintenance and scale back outreach. If we want to maintain the UK’s position as a global leader in theatre – and continue to inspire the next generation of actors, writers, and technicians – then government must act.”The report, drawing on information from theatres that are members of the two organisations, states that one in five venues “require at least £5m over the next decade simply to remain operational”. Without substantial capital funding, nearly 40% “could close or become unusable”. Roughly one in four organisations ran a deficit in 2023–24, and almost one-third project a shortfall in the subsequent financial year.Since 2010, funding from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has fallen by 18% per person in real terms, notes the report, while local authority support has declined by as much as 48%. “Years of decline in creative education and underinvestment in skills training have left theatres struggling to recruit and retain staff,” it adds, with almost half of theatre leaders saying that new hires lack the necessary skills, particularly in technical roles.Against this backdrop, and the challenges of the pandemic and cost of living crisis, the two organisations’ member theatres drew audiences in excess of 37 million in 2024. ItsWest Endvenues “surpassed 17.1 million attenders [akin to 2023 levels] and generated more than £1bn in revenue”. Data from 48 regional venues shows a 4% increase in occupancy between 2019 and 2024 yet also underlined what regular theatregoers around the UK will have noticed: the number of shows being programmed has, in many cases, dropped in the last five years as theatres prune their schedules amid financial challenges.Bemoaning news headlines about premium ticket prices, the report stated that across the UK most tickets were sold for £39.50 or less (with 19% priced under £20 outside London), while in the West End most were sold at £56 or less. Since 2019, the average West End ticket price has fallen by 5.3% in real terms.Research quoted by the report shows that for every £1 spent on a theatre ticket, “an additional £1.40 is spent in the local economy”, while every pound of public investment returns more than £11 to the Treasury. The report said that the West End’s 11% post-pandemic audience growth is unmatched in the UK’s entertainment sector and highlighted that, last year, “nearly one in four international visitors to London attended a West End show – a testament to its global appeal”.Explore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndArts fundingTicket pricesConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

But in their lawsuit, they claim that UMG has said those termination notices are not valid because Salt-N-Pepa’s songs were “works made for hire” and so the duo cannot reclaim the rights.“UMG appears to take the position that it can unilaterally decide when and/or if a recording artist is entitled to termination. This is not the law, and UMG does not have this power,” the lawsuit states.The group’s first two albums, 1986’s Hot, Cool & Vicious and 1988’s A Salt With a Deadly Pepa, were removed from streaming services between May and July 2024. Denton and James allege that was a “punitive measure” by UMG, saying the company “indicated that it will hold plaintiffs’ rights hostage even if it means tanking the value of plaintiffs’ music catalogue and depriving their fans of access to their work”. They claim they lost out on “substantial royalties” when the catalogue was offline.The duo have claimed that rights to their 1990 album Blacks’ Magic should have returned to them in March, are they also looking to win back the rights to later albums in May 2026.Denton and James are seeking financial damages, and an injunction against UMG infringing on their copyright.UMG have responded, saying: “Salt-N-Pepa’s own legal filings demonstrate the repeated attempts we have made to resolve this matter amicably (including offers to enter into a mediation) ever since the artists served an invalid termination notice.“Although we had no legal obligation to do so, we still sought to find a way to improve the artists’ compensation and pay them directly – even after they had sold their royalty streams to a third party.“Clearly, the artists’ legal counsel thinks they can use the threat of negative media coverage from the lawsuit to achieve their unreasonable demands. Despite this, and consistent with our longstanding practice, we remain committed to working towards an amicable resolution.”Though they haven’t released an album since 1997’s Brand New, Salt-N-Pepa have continued to tour, with their most recent dates in 2023.They were among the first women to win a Grammy for a rap performance, in 1995 for the track None of Your Business, taken from the album Very Necessary. Two other tracks from the album reached the US Top Five, Shoop and the En Vogue collaboration Whatta Man. They were given a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2021, and earlier this year were included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s musical influence category.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockRapHip-hopnewsShareReuse this content"

The implication is always that if we don’t find that courage, we will spiral downwards.”John le Carré: ‘I was a secret even to myself’Read moreThe Spy Who Came in from the Cold was adapted shortly after its publicationinto a filmstarring Richard Burton as Alec Leamas, the titular spy who is convinced to go back into the field by the spymaster George Smiley. But it was not until last year’s run at the Minerva theatre in Chichester that a Le Carré novel had been adapted for the stage.The playwright David Eldridge, who adapted the novel for the stage said the initial idea for the adaptation came at around the same time as thenovichok poisoning in Salisbury, which raised the question of how a country reacts to such an attack. “Should you respond in kind, so that you can defeat your enemy?” Eldridge said. “But in doing so, do you compromise your value system?”The idea of where British intelligence services draw the line is one of the dominant themes of the story. As is the effect that spying has on Leamas, who isin a state of existential despairat the end of the novel.Some of the action takes place in East Germany, and Harkaway said the appearance of the Berlin wall – the dividing line across the city thatfell in 1989– as part of the stage set was a dramatic reminder of the period.“We talk about modern relevance – well, this was a scar across the middle of Europe which existed for 40 years,” he said. “When you see that up close, it’s really powerful.”From cold war spy to angry old man: the politics of John le CarréRead moreLeamas calls spies a “squalid procession of vain fools, traitors, too, yes; pansies, sadists and drunkards, people who play cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten lives”.When Eldridge met Le Carré, beforehis death in 2020, the novelist told him “not to get carried away with the idea that intelligence officers are a special breed in some way”, repeatedly saying that they’re just “ordinary people”. Eldridge said his adaptation was true to that idea.The Guardian’sMark Lawson commentedon the “extreme moral ambiguity” of Smiley in the Chichester production as he battles with his Russian counterpart – and nemesis – the KGB’s Karla. Lawson also praised Agnes O’Casey’s performance as the librarian Liz Gold, who gets caught up in the brutal churn of spycraft.Eldridge said: “The novel and the play constantly asks the audience whether it’s worth it or not.”The Spy Who Came in from the Cold opens on 17 November at Soho Place and runs until 21 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreJohn le CarréEspionagenewsShareReuse this content"

Travel and new outfits for the concert will also attract a considerable spend, calculated at £70.50 and £73.70, respectively, while an average of £59.70 will be spent on merchandise.More than £75 will be spent on pre-concert food and drinks, while the cost of a pint at venues such as Wembley Stadium and Manchester’s Heaton Park will hit about £8.Almost 30% of fans surveyed said they intended to embrace 90s fashion trends at the concert, sporting baggy jeans, tracksuit jackets and trainers, while 14% are going as far as sporting a haircut inspired by the Gallagher brothers.The £1.06bn exceeds the estimate Barclays made forTaylor Swift’s Eras Tourof £997m, although Oasis are playing two more nights than the US singer’s UK tour last year.In justifying the cost, 16% of fans said they had bought tickets as a gift, while 30% described it as a “sentimental purchase” due to the significance the band’s music had played in their life.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The film cycles through a range of moods and ideas, and finally delivers a fair bit of that sentimentality from the title; it’s a movie of daddy issues and cinematic adventures in the manner of Fellini and Bergman, with a gag about overhearing a therapist’s session through the heating pipes, pinched from Woody Allen’s Another Woman.Stellan Skarsgård plays preening auteur Gustav Borg, whose career is on the slide; many years ago, he left his wife, Sissel, a psychotherapist, and two grownup daughters, abandoning the family home – the house where Gustav himself was brought up. Now their mother has died and Gustav’s daughter Nora (Reinsve), a famous stage actor starring in a production of A Doll’s House, is suffering anxiety attacks – and to snap out of it, she asks to be slapped backstage by the (married) actor with whom she is having an affair, played by longtime Trier player Anders Danielsen Lie.The Six Billion Dollar Man review – WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange’s rise, fall and limboRead moreNora’s sister, Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas), is a little calmer and more grounded, being happily settled with husband and young son, though a little messed up by the memory of having once had a small child-actor role in one of Gustav’s films – and feeling abandoned once the filming was over. Just as the two women are sorting through the house’s contents for things of sentimental value they might want to keep before selling the house, they are stunned to realise that the insufferable Gustav actually still has legal rights to the property and now wants to use it as a location for a biopic about his mother, who took her own life there due to the trauma of being tortured by the Nazis during the war.To add insult to injury, Gustav begs Nora to take the lead role of her own grandmother, expecting that Nora, whom he neglected for most of her life, will use her stage fame to revive his flagging career. He even asks Agnes to let him use her young son as a child actor, just as she once was used. But after Nora angrily refuses, the part is taken by Hollywood superstar Rachel Kemp (Elle Fanning), who has fallen for Gustav’s rascally charm at a film festival and brings with her huge amounts of investment funding. So Nora gets to be jealous and upset all over again.The stage appears to be set for an uproarious but bittersweet black comedy of the movie world and show business and the emotional vampirism and ruthlessness it involves, with a touch of All About Eve perhaps – made worse when you are working with members of your own family. And to some extent, that is what we get. But this long and slightly indulgent film also ranges across moods of rather serious wintriness and cinephile sadness about the changing industry. Gustav had insisted on using a veteran cinematographer with whom he’d worked many times, but realises he’s going to have to rescind the offer when he sees how decrepit the poor guy now is.There are also cinephile in-jokes (which are also Cannesphile in-jokes). When Agnes’s son has his 10th birthday, Gustav brings the poor boy an outrageously unsuitable present: some brand-new DVDs of horribly shocking films like Michael Haneke’s The Piano Teacher and Gaspar Noé’s Irreversible – but Trier shows the ultimate irony is that they don’t have a DVD player. Technological changes have robbed these films of the power to shock.We are of course heading for an emollient ending in which Gustav’s very real talent is to be acknowledged along with his muddled, flawed, old-guy affection for his daughters – and maybe Trier himself is now not above a bit of fictional ancestor-worship appropriate to his own high status. It’s a baggy comedy, sentimental in ways that are not entirely intentional, but there is value, too.Sentimental Value screened at the Cannes film festivalExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsStellan SkarsgårdElle FanningCannes film festivalNorwayEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Eugene Jarecki’s documentary takes its title from the price the incoming Ecuadorian government supposedly charged the Trump administration for helping furnish his extradition to the US, thereby reneging on a promise of political asylum. If The Six Billion Dollar Man doesn’t rebuild Assange, exactly, that’s because it’s more interested in comprehensively demolishing his enemies. Compared to the hypocrites, scoundrels and crooks who surround him, the man himself looks almost virtuous.Actually Assange is mostly a background presence here. He’s more talked about than talking up; a karmic victim of his own success. While even his supporters admit to his personal failings (arrogance, cruelty, bouts of megalomania), the film asks us to regard him as a messenger shot down by bigger, darker forces; a man whose only real crime was publishing inconvenient truths.The Swedish rape charge, it argues, was largely cooked up as a means of delivering him to the US authorities, so that they in turn could charge him with violating the Espionage Act. “Julian Assange is not an angel carved in marble,” says the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden (no angel himself). “But he’s not a vial of poison either.”Poison or not, Assange’s release of diplomatic and military secrets leaked into the water table and served to destabilise the US government. Jarecki’s film provides a crisp, thorough recap of WikiLeaks’ greatest hits, beginning withthe publishing of the “collateral murder video”that showed US forces slaughtering unarmed civilians in Iraq, and reveals the ways in which the internet’s unfettered heyday was able to service a new kind of activism. Previously, whistleblowers such as Daniel Ellsberg (who leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971) released classified information at enormous personal risk. Thanks to Assange’s website, they could now do so anonymously, and on an industrial scale.The film makes the case, though, that WikiLeaks was at its most fire-proofed when it stayed small and nimble and operated with a skeleton crew.Its explosive release of diplomatic cableswas a high-profile joint venture, published in association with the Guardian, the New York Times and Der Spiegel, and the ensuing fallout placed Assange in the crosshairs. “Politically we’re untouchable now,” he brags as he arrives for a meeting at the Guardian and it is possibly this kind of hubris that made him blind to the danger. In September 2011an indiscriminate dump of unredacted US embassy cablesput scores of innocent lives at risk and tarnished his credentials as a crusading campaigner.View image in fullscreenJulian Assange poses for photographers at the photo call for The Six Billion Dollar Man.Photograph: Lewis Joly/Invision/APIt is the dark irony of the WikiLeaks story that the site should itself be undone by a series of leaks and betrayals. Assange’s former colleagues blame David Leigh, the Guardian’s former investigations editor, for publishing a top-secret password in the WikiLeaks book he co-wrote with Luke Harding. But the real Judas of Jarecki’s film isSigurdur “Siggi” Thordarson, a creepy teenage hacker inexplicably beloved by Assange. It was Siggi, we learn, who embezzled $50,000 (£37,000) from the company’s online store and who later agreed to wear an FBI wiretap.Initially a safe house, the Ecuadorian embassy in central London is revealed to turn by degrees into a false sanctuary. The film claims that Assange was effectively sold out by the building’s private security staff, who bugged CCTV cameras and passed the footage to a band of small-time crooks. His friends worried that Assange’s life in limbo was making him increasingly paranoid.While Assange has already been the subject of numerous documentaries, plusThe Fifth Estate, a Hollywood drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch, The Six Billion Dollar Man feels close to definitive. It’s rigorous and forensic and covers the ground with aplomb. Jarecki’s army of eye-witnesses run the gamut from Naomi Klein to Pamela Anderson (a fan and frequent visitor) to the former president of Ecuador, while the film’s sprawling crime scene eventually straddles half the globe.For all that, its most indelible, disquieting images are provided by the CCTV footage of Assange marooned in the embassy. He knows he’s being bugged and understands that he’s trapped and he paces his quarters like a hapless Gene Hackman at the end of Francis Ford Copppola’s The Conversation. Whatever he set out to be it almost certainly wasn’t this: the anguished poster boy for a world in which every hacker gets hacked, every person is spied on and no secret is safe.The Six Billion Dollar Man screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsJulian AssangeWikiLeaksThe GuardianThe US embassy cablesNational newspapersreviewsShareReuse this content"

Plus some incredible dancers.To the good stuff first: these dancers, the men especially, are so vividly alive in Canadian choreographer Crystal Pite’s Frontier, with quicksilver reflexes and fizzing energy, even though everything’s executed with total control. Soloists dressed in white dance Pite’s treacle moves as if you can see the gravity. But they are among shadows, hooded figures all in black, who at times lift and support the soloists as if they’re being carried by invisible forces. Elsewhere they loom ominously, they are ghosts or fears. The mood is eerie with the whispers and echoes of Owen Belton’s soundtrack.Pite has a way with readable visual ideas. What might amount to a line written down – black v white, individual v group – becomes expansive in movement, sensitively alive. (She has said the dark figures represent the unknowns of the universe and consciousness, but it works whether you know that or not.) She has a talent for composition and structure, and for considering the audience’s journey. The transcendent voices of composer Eric Whitacre open the piece and they return at its end in a choral catharsis, to make a satisfying whole.View image in fullscreenReadable visual ideas … Eduardo Jiménez Cabrera in Frontier by Crystal Pite.Photograph: Michael SlobodianThis mastery of composition is something that’s missing in Johan Inger’s piece Passing (and, to be fair, in a lot of choreography). The Swede is much less well known in the UK than Pite. ENB danced his Carmen last year, but this is a lighter piece, certainly at the outset. It feels human in scale, with guitar-picking music and folksy movement, playing out snippets of life’s landmarks and seasons, its circles, rituals and relationships, with light, colour and humour; the dance itself is pleasingly wry in tone.But somewhere around the halfway point, it becomes overstretched. A mournful a cappella song outstays its welcome, things get nebulous. The company end up circling the stage in their underwear in a huge shower of confetti – it’s beautiful to look at, but missing the profundity it’s no doubt aiming for. The thick drone of the soundtrack doesn’t help. Bring back that choir!AtSadler’s Wells, London, until 21 May.

There’s plenty to love about thisUS import, acountry musicalwith a zany corn obsession and a message about breaking down barriers that suits this open air theatre. But just how much corn-fed wordplay can you stomach? You’ll soon find out. There’s a maze of maize jokes, some kernels of truth amid the cornball sentiment, a husk of a plot about a corn doctor mistakenly assumed to treat ears not feet and a few painful gags about cornholes. The actors essentially double as standups, delivering one-liners that are often very funny and occasionally enhance character and story but are mostly fired at random as if punslingerTim Vinehad been cloned and let loose.We’re in Cob County where Maizy (I’m afraid so) is about to wed Beau. When the small town’s valuable corn crop fails, she journeys to Tampa, Florida, for answers and meets conman Gordy who has two dubious claims – one on her heart and one that he can save the beleaguered town. A handsome design includes costumes by Tilly Grimes (dungarees, neckerchiefs, denim), golden lighting by Japhy Weideman and a stage bookended by cornfield thickets and circled by glowing purple rocks. Scott Pask’s set features a huge barn, its rafters broken and exposed to the elements, the whole building slanting as if about to be uprooted by The Wizard of Oz’s tornado.But it’s Brandy Clark and Shane McAnally’s songs that often blow you away: hoedowns, lonesome ballads, stagecoach rhythms, loud and proud show tunes, with a five-piece band heavy on the guitars and giving a percussive boost to the humour. Sarah O’Gleby’s choreography slowly builds up steam, with performers eventually walking on whiskey barrels and mixing hand claps with foot slaps.View image in fullscreenSongs that often blow you away … Shucked.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianGeorgina Onuorah thoroughly takes possession of Independently Owned, an anthem of self-determination – no mean feat as it is so closely linked with Alex Newellwho won a Tony awardin the same role as whiskey-making Lulu. When Ben Joyce (Beau) sings a solo called OK you half want him to do a full country set himself while Sophie McShera makes a yearning case for a world of windows not walls in Maizy’s solo. Matthew Seadon-Young has fun with a jazzy number about Gordy’s bid to be badder. Under Katy Richardson’s musical direction, many shades and themes of country music are present yet the lyrics sometimes lack the genre’s reputation for storytelling.The show is moved along by two storytellers, a little like theMean Girls musical, with Monique Ashe-Palmer and Steven Webb sharing a nice rapport. With a book by Robert Horn, it’s presented as a fable, not as you may first think about climate catastrophe but about loving neighbours and welcoming strangers, respecting home yet not being afraid to roam.But when even the thinly drawn characters express alarm at the words they’re saying, it’s hard to invest in the relationships. Comedies tend to have one wise-cracking role like the goofy Peanut (Keith Ramsay), but here everyone shares the compulsion to deliver bon mots, lollipop stick jokes and small-town homespun humour. It’s ultimately exhausting and not only flattens character but reduces dialogue to the same pattern of setup, pause and punchline (many of which you see coming), slowing down Jack O’Brien’s rambling production.Would it help if you were familiar with Hee Haw, the country music variety TV show to which it pays homage? Perhaps. But across town,Mischief Theatreare unleashing their own barrage of groansome gags inThe Comedy About Spies, a dizzily ridiculous farce which ambushes audiences on many levels, including making you sympathetic towards the unlikeliest characters.

Since then the much-garlanded New Zealander has contrived to be not only conspicuously prolific but also intriguingly unpredictable. Though she returned to wartime Germany in her Women’s prize-longlisted Holocaust novel,Remote Sympathy, her work has ranged from the coming-of-age psychological thrillerPettoThe Beat of the Pendulum, a “found” novel that drew on everything from conversations and social media posts to news bulletins and even satnav instructions to create a picture of one woman’s life over a year. The Axeman’s Carnival, published in the UK last year, was partly narrated by a magpie. Like The Wish Child it won the Acorn prize for fiction, making Chidgey the only writer to win New Zealand’s most prestigious prize twice.The Book of Guilt appears to mark another departure. Chidgey describes her ninth novel as her “first foray into dystopian fiction” and, while the book purports to be set in England in 1979 with a female prime minister newly ensconced in Downing Street, it is not the country we know. In Chidgey’s alternate universe, the second world war ended not in 1945 with allied victory, but in 1943 when the assassination of Hitler by German conspirators led to a swiftly negotiated peace treaty. Subsequent collaboration across Europe has ensured that progress in biological and medical science, already significantly advanced, has accelerated, fuelled by shared research that includes the grotesque experiments carried out on prisoners in Nazi death camps.The shadow of those atrocities lingers over 13-year-old identical triplets Vincent, William and Lawrence, the last three remaining occupants of a secluded New Forest children’s home, part of the government’s Sycamore Scheme. Supervised by three “Mothers”, each working an eight-hour daily shift, the boys do their lessons and their exercises and take their medicine, in constant battle with a sickness which, though its symptoms vary from boy to boy and month to month, is referred to only as the Bug. They long to get well so that they will finally be granted the wish of every Sycamore child before them and be sent to the Big House in Margate, an earthly seaside paradise with sun-soaked golden sands and unlimited access to the Dreamland amusement park. But though the boys pore over the dog-eared Margate brochure, “we never dreamt of trying to escape”, an older, wiser Vincent confesses as the novel opens. “Those were happy days, before I knew what I was.” Since then the Scheme has been abandoned, the Sycamore homes sold off. People do not like to talk about it, Vincent admits. Nobody wants to feel guilty.If all this sounds reminiscent of Kazuo Ishiguro’s most famous novelNever Let Me Go, that is because, in many ways, it absolutely is. The similarities go far beyond the late 1970s institutional setting. Like Kathy, Ruth and Tommy, Ishiguro’s trio of students at Hailsham, the Sycamore boys know they are different, special even, and yet their lives share Hailsham’s whiff of wartime make-do-and-mend, where the lessons are rudimentary and everything is secondhand. Like the Hailsham students, the triplets are sheltered not only from the truth of their circumstances but also from any meaningful contact with or grasp of the world that fears and exploits them. Like them, they will only gradually and painfully come to understand their real purpose. Vincent’s first-person narration addresses the reader directly, recalling Kathy’s conversational style.And yet, for all the inevitable comparisons, it becomes clear as Chidgey’s novel unfolds that it is by no means a clone of Ishiguro’s. While both novels take as their starting point the grave dangers posed by unfettered scientific advancement, Never Let Me Go is, at its heart, a meditation on mortality, an exploration of humankind’s profound resistance to the idea that we must all eventually be parted from those whom we love. Ishiguro does not seek to rationalise or explain the world in which the book is set. His interest is personal, not political.The Book of Guilt, by contrast, unfolds an alternate political reality, intercutting Vincent’s account with two other parallel narratives. Nancy is a girl held as a kind of prisoner by her adoring parents, while the harassed Minister of Loneliness is charged with winding up the Scheme. They combine to create a compulsively readable story that raises profound questions not only about the power of the state to dehumanise parts of our society but about our complicity in that power, the doublethink that permits us simultaneously to know a truth and not know it, to see and somehow contrive not to believe, dehumanising us in its turn.These questions run through all Chidgey’s work: they are the connective tissue that binds her seemingly contrasting projects and, in 2025, as the US turns its back on the world, they are more urgent than ever. The Book of Guilt is written with insight and brio, deftly balancing darkness and light, depth and pace. Set in its own distinctive time and space, it could have been extraordinary. Instead the ghost of Ishiguro stalks its pages, dragging behind it the inevitable clanking comparisons and fatally undermining the integrity of the world Chidgey has so painstakingly created.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Fitzcarraldo was Herzog’s own bizarre and brilliant story idea, crazily amplifying and exaggerating a case from real life.Early 20th-century opera enthusiast Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald, played with straw-hair and mad blue eyes by Klaus Kinski, goes into the rubber trade to make enough money to realise his dream of building an opera house in the Peruvian port town of Iquito; he works out that the steamship needed to transport materials can only be brought into the required stretch of water by dragging it across land between two tributaries. This is a crazy, magnificent and operatic obsession, more grandiose than anything that could be presented on stage, for which he will need Indigenous peoples as slave labour to haul the ship. By playing these tribes his Caruso records on an old gramophone player, he persuades them he is a white god who must be obeyed.In the original case, an entrepreneur (called Carlos Fermin Fitzcarrald) reportedly transported a 300-ton ship across land by disassembling it into a couple of dozen pieces; Herzog insisted on shifting the ship whole, and moreover insisted on filming these scenes in the remote interior, not near Iquito itself – which would have been far easier and probably would have looked the same. In the jungle, the cast and crew suffered the agonies of early settlers and colonial adventurers: illness, discomfort, poison-arrow attacks and, above all, mind-bending boredom as the weather meant that nothing could be done for months at a time. Perhaps no other period movie in history has so closely duplicated the subject matter in its gruelling shoot.Herzog’s original lead casting, Jason Robards, dropped out with amoebic dysentery and Mick Jagger, who was to play the innocent sidekick, evidently saw what an ordeal he was in for and dropped out as well, citing the need to record the album Tattoo You. Herzog surrendered to the inevitable and cast his old frenemy-slash-muse Kinski; but the mercurial hothead-genius was naturally hurt at not being first choice and made everyone’s life hell with arguments and complaints. And it is difficult to get your head around the thought of what it must have been like for the cast and crew just waiting, waiting, waiting for Herzog to decree that, yes, we can shoot.‘A goalkeeper vomited over my typewriter’: Werner Herzog on writing his wildest filmRead moreThis is a strangely subdued documentary, recorded as it was more or less contemporaneously with the film itself but which doesn’t fully show the nightmarish things which were soon to become legendary. (Fax Bahr and George Hickenlooper’s 1991 film Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker’s Apocalypse, about the horror of making Coppola’s Apocalypse Now in the late 70s, had the advantage of time and gave us far more juicy and scary material.) Herzog himself is shown talking mournfully about his disasters: the light-plane crashes that are supposed to have critically injured some people and paralysed another. (But these people are not named. What actually happened?)We do however see the darkness and intensity of Herzog himself as he descants on how much he loves but also hates the jungle in that unmistakable voice of his. “The birds don’t sing … they just screech in pain. Theirs is the harmony of overwhelming collective murder … I love it against my better judgment.” Amazingly, Herzog always looks in pretty good shape, considering what he’s gone through, and put others through. His burden of dreams is borne with some style. It’s a good curtain-raiser to the film itself.Burden of Dreams is in UK cinemas from 23 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsWerner HerzogPeruAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

Like one of those fairground punching bags, it pops right back up every time a crisis knocks it down. Friedrich Engels learned this the hard way. “The American crash is superb,” he enthused in a letter to Karl Marx in 1857: this was communism’s big chance. Well, not quite. The US Treasury stepped in, recapitalising banks with its gold reserves; in Britain the Bank Charter Act was suspended to enable the printing of money. The rulebook was torn up and capitalism saved.So it has always been. Every time we have teetered close to the precipice, big government has swooped down to save the day. The name of the game is “managed capitalism” and it has been a going concern for more than 200 years. This is the theme of John Cassidy’s new book, a marvellously lucid overview of capitalism’s critics, written in good old-fashioned expository prose – if at times a touch workmanlike compared with some of his subjects, such as exhilarating stylists Marx and Carlyle.Half of the book is given over toMitteleuropa (where we meet Karl Polanyi and Rosa Luxemburg, both of whom are having a bit of a moment these days), India (JC Kumarappa, Gandhi’s crony and pioneer of ecological economics), and Latin America (whose dependency theorists argued that the developed world was scooping up the benefits of rising productivity at the developing world’s expense). Cassidy steers clear of the theoretical thickets of György Lukács and Louis Althusser as well as of the more idiosyncratic anti-capitalist paths taken by Milovan Djilas and José Carlos Mariátegui. Still, it would be churlish to complain about omissions in a book that finds room for 50 potted biographies. This is by far the best primer I have read on the luminaries of the economic left.Early socialists, Cassidy shows, had little faith in government and equated the state with upper-class corruption. Many of them were sentimentalists or oddballs. The utilitarian socialist William Thompson, for one, thought it was possible to kill the “passion for individual accumulation” simply by substituting cooperation for competition; the humans he describes sound suspiciously like Sims characters. Carlyle’s anti-capitalism (“Mammon-worship is a melancholy creed”), meanwhile, led him to a pro-slavery position.We owe the left as we know it to Marx and Engels, who railed against financialisation and monopolisation – the “concentration of capital” – and defended planning and public ownership. The collapse of capitalism that they foresaw, however, never came to pass. From their vantage point of 1840, wages had flatlined even as profits had soared over the previous 50 years. This immiseration would surely bring about the system’s downfall. Yet the following century reversed the trend: wages rose faster than profits, and capitalism found new champions among the workers.Unlike the factory-owning Engels, Keynes was no class traitor: “The class war will find me on the side of the educated bourgeoisie.” His mid-century magic formula, low interest rates and tax-and-spend, led to astonishing growth and stability in the short run. Rachel Reeves could benefit from his counsel for countercyclical spending: “the engine which drives Enterprise is not Thrift but Profit”.But Keynes, as Paul Sweezy complained, treated the economy as if it were a machine that could be sent for repair. There were “political aspects of full employment” that Keynes had ignored, Sweezy’s Marxist comrade Michał Kalecki elaborated. Low unemployment meant enhanced labour power, so more strikes and higher wages and inflation. A capitalist backlash would ensue, he predicted.That is precisely what happened in the 70s. Milton Friedman made the case for a “natural rate of unemployment”, by which he meant that more unemployment was needed in order to destroy labour power and push down wages. This confirmed Marx’s observation that a “reserve army” of desperate jobless workers was the best weapon capital had to cripple unionism. Where Nixon could call himself a Keynesian, his successors Carter and then Reagan turned to neoliberalism.High interest rates and anti-union legislation followed. After a brief mid-century egalitarian blip in which economic growth exceeded the rate of return on capital, the opposite has once again become true in our own gilded age. This was Thomas Piketty’s insight, demonstrated with the sophistication of statistics, in his Capital in the Twenty-First Century.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There is not a single snide remark in these pages. He plays his cards close to his chest, but I suspect he might confess to being a Keynesian. A clue lies in his conclusion – “capitalism can be reformed” – which reminded me of Fredric Jameson’s witticism that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism.Capitalism and Its Critics by John Cassidy is published by Allen Lane (£35).

It’s the world’s third-biggest producer of pinot noir grapes (after Burgundy and Champagne), yet although its vineyards are energetically promoted worldwide, few shout about its tourism potential.Which is astonishing, as the area is as gorgeous as its nickname – the “Tuscany of the north” – suggests. Its green hills have a fairytale look, dotted as they are with castles and medieval abbeys, terracotta villages such as Fortunago, and remote homesteads. Visitor numbers have been rising since Covid forced Italians to make more of what’s on their doorstep, but are still low, as are prices, and it is possible to walk, cycle or drive for miles without seeing anyone.View image in fullscreenThe town of Varzi.Photograph: AGF Srl/AlamyPartly to work up an appetite but mainly because the Staffora valley merits slow exploration, we make for Varzi on two wheels, hiring bikes fromDionisio Cicliin Rivanazzano Terme. The Oltrepò’s biggest town, Voghera, on the mainline from Milan, is the starting point of theGreenway Voghera-Varzi, a 22-mile (35km) former railway perfect for relaxed cycling or walking.We stop for coffee in Salice Terme, a 19th-century spa town with a huge park, then sweep on past Godiasco and Ponte Nizza, with its railway museum, to Bagnaria, a village of cherry orchards. In early summer, we cycle past trees laden with glossy fruits, and fields with matching red poppies. At a cherry festival on the second and third Sundays in June, visitors can sample the produce, applaud prizewinners and try cherry risotto with local wine.The Oltrepò’s unspoilt nature shows in its impressive biodiversity: this area of just over 380 square miles has, for example, about double the number of species of butterfly as the UK, which has 59. There are severaldesignated butterfly walks, but we spot beauties everywhere we look, in red, orange, yellow, pale green and dramatic black and white.It’s quiet today, but we are riding what was a well-trodden trail. The Staffora valley formed part of the ancient Via del Sale, the trade route on which wool and weapons from the north of Italy were taken by mule over the Giovà pass to seaports in Liguria to exchange for precious salt for use in delicious salami, among other things.View image in fullscreenThe famous salame di Varzi salami.Photograph: Pascopix/AlamyWe enter Varzi from the west, leaving the open Greenway for a maze of narrow alleys. The town’s importance as a waypoint on the salt route shows in its porticoed streets lined with three-storey merchants’ houses. Hidden in the centre is the 13th-century Castello Malaspina, recently reopened for weddings, events, guided tours and wine and salami tastings. Current owner Enrico Odetti, descended from the family that was given the land in 1164 by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, has plans to add a dozen B&B rooms.History records a 12th-century Marquis of Malaspina offering prizedsalame di Varzito guests, and there are plenty of places in town where a 21st-century visitor can try it, but its home is in the countryside nearby. We head south to the hamlet of Bosmenso, where the fourth generation of the Buscone family (sisters Ornella, Roberta and Marina) make salami from semi-wild pigs free to rootle for acorns, and age it for at least three months, usually six. They also run the eponymous Buscone restaurant. “It’s in our DNA,” says Roberta.The Oltrepò is the world’s third-biggest producer of pinot noir grapes, after Burgundy and ChampagneAs instructed by Carlo we note the rich red and pure white of the salami – cut on a diagonal with a knife – its aromas of grassy fields, crusty bread and mild garlic, and the sweet yet deeply savoury taste. It makes a perfect antipasto with pickled veg from their garden, plus glasses of Bonarda, the Oltrepò’s classic slightly sparkling red.Over the following days we visit more wineries (see below) and eat extremely well, fuel for activities such as a circular five-mile walk through chestnut woods from the village of Moglie to the Sant’Alberto di Butrio hermitage, on a craggy hillside. The 10th-century complex is surrounded by roses, geraniums and beehives, and frescoes in one of its three chapels look as bright as they must have looked when painted 600 years ago. The route back takes in Pizzocorno village, famous for strong-smelling cheese made with milk from small, hardyvacca varzesecows.View image in fullscreenPinot noir harvest in the Oltrepò Pavese vineyards.Photograph: Independent Photo Agency Srl/AlamyNext day, we swap the middle ages for the mid-20th century at a brilliant gallery in Rivanazzano founded by locally born Franco Riccardi (artartnews.com, €10/£8.50pp), who has spent the past 50 years putting together a treasure house, in a former wine warehouse, of paintings and sculptures from the 1930s to 70s.There is also a modern art museum at Castello dal Verme in the east of the Oltrepò. Seems whether it’s pork, wine, untrodden hills or fine canvases, this corner of Lombardy has good living off to a fine art.WineriesAtCà del Ge, among high green hills, sisters Sara and Stefania, daughters of founder winemaker Enzo Padroggi, make quality rieslings from grapes normally associated with Germany, and 5,000 bottles a year ofméthode champenoisesparkling.Travaglino, a former monastery on the wooded slopes of Monte Ceresino, uses pinot noir for more deep-flavoured “champagne” but we also like a simpler red Pernero tasting of wild strawberries and balsamic vinegar.Castello di Luzzanois presided over by winemaker and sculptor Giovanella Fugazza, who has worked for more than 40 years on the estate developed by her father. A spider made of wire, bike chain, spark plugs and oyster shells sits in the courtyard, and her wine labels are all modern masterpieces. Up winding lanes in the Ardivestra valley is family-ownedCastello di Stefanago, where Giacomo Baruffaldi cultivates 20 hectares of organic biodynamic vineyards. We particularly like his Ancestrale 36 sparkling rosé.Hidden Italy: where to stay and what to do off the beaten trackRead moreRestaurantsIn the hill village ofNazzano,Il Belvederelives up to its name with sweeping views over theStaffora valleyand traditional food (plenty for vegetarians), served by owner Stefano Migliora. As well as its charcuterie,Ristorante Buscone, near Varzi, offers homemade pastas and mains such as roast duck with garden veg, or delicious caramelised pork ribs. In Salice Terme, the kitchen atIl Caminettois run by Giovanna Torti, still rattling the pans at 82. Specialities are risotto with sweet yellow peppers from Voghera, and baked-to-ordercannoncini, pastry tubes filled with cream.Where to stayAccommodation in the area is slowly increasing as tourism develops.Castello di Luzzanohas four romantic doubles in what used to be a salt route tollhouse, from €130 including breakfast on a shady terrace.

This Japanese-style condiment, dipping sauce and dressing made from ground sesame seeds is powerful in flavour, sweet, sour and creamy all at the same time, while the addition of grated ginger and/or garlic makes it wonderfully piquant, too. It’s also very moreish and hugely versatile, meaning you can serve it with everything from a traditionalshabu shabuhot pot to cold noodles, tofu, aubergine and slaw; in fact, it’s so tasty I have to stop myself from eating it straight from the jar. My recipe uses the leftover tahini in the bottom of a jar and comes together in the jar itself, so minimising both waste and washing-up. Simply add all the ingredients, scrape down the sides and shake (you can apply a similar method to the ends of a peanut butter jar, too, for a nutty, satay-style twist).Tahini jar goma dareThis is my take on an old favourite fromKoya in Soho, London. I hadn’t thought to recreate it at home before, but its simplicity and incredible flavour mean it’s easy and satisfying to make from scratch. It’s a super-resourceful way to turn a few scraps of tahini into a restaurant-quality condiment. I’ve listed the basic ingredients and given optional extras such as mayo (to make it extra creamy) and white miso (to add salt and umami complexity). Think of each ingredient as a seasoning, so adjust to taste to add more punch and flavour (garlic and ginger), sweetness (honey, miso), sourness (vinegar) or salt (soy, miso).MakesAbout 100ml(or enough for 2 generous servings)1 nearly empty tahini jar, with about 2-3 tbsp remaining2 tbsp soy sauce, or tamari1 tbsp rice vinegar, or other vineger such as cider vinegar2 tsp honey, or sugarOptional extras1 tbsp mayonnaise1 tsp white miso paste1 tsp toasted sesame oil1 tsp freshly grated ginger1 small garlic clove, peeled and finely gratedTo serve (all optional)Soba noodlesSauteed aubergineShredded noriFinely sliced spring onion topsToasted sesame seedsAdd the soy sauce, vinegar, honey and two tablespoons of water to the near-empty tahini jar, then add the optional mayo, white miso paste, toasted sesame oil, ginger and/or garlic. Stir with a small spatula or spoon, scraping the sides and bottom of the jar to loosen and incorporate the tahini, then screw on the lid and shake vigorously until smooth and emulsified, again scraping the sides as necessary. If the sauce seems a bit too thick, add a splash more water to loosen and shake again.Use immediately, or store in the fridge for up to a week. The sauce may thicken up in the fridge and may need a little water and another shake before using.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteSauces and graviesJapanese food and drinkSide dishesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s hard to beat the joy of messily eating one over a sink, but these flaky, American-style shortcakes, which you may recognise as similar to scones, are a brilliant mango delivery method. Meanwhile, there are few things that pistachio doesn’t improve, and here pistachio cream, which is conveniently fortified with sugar and fat, and emulsified to a smooth, spoonable paste, is paired with coffee in the form of an airy tiramisu to feed a crowd.Mango shortcakes (pictured top)Using cold grated butter and performing a few roll, stack and folds will give you towering shortcakes with tender middles and crisp tops.Prep10 minCook1 hrMakes6For the flaky scones120g very cold butter250g plain flour, plus extra for dusting10g baking powder½ tsp flaky salt30g caster sugar130g buttermilk, plus extra for brushing2 tsp granulated sugarFor the whipped cream150g greek yoghurt30g caster sugar150g double creamTo finish3-4 small ripe Indian mangoes(I like alphonso), peeled and cut into thin horizontal strips1limeGrate the cold butter on to a plate. In a large bowl, whisk the dry ingredients for the scones, then add the grated butter in four instalments, tossing well between each addition. If the mix clumps, keep tossing and squishing it between your fingertips until any large clumps have dispersed.Add the buttermilk in two instalments, stirring and tossing the mixture with a spatula to hydrate it – it will be sticky in some places and dry in others – then tip the dough on to a clean work surface and squish into a roughly 20cm x 12cm rectangle. Using a rolling pin, roll out to 30cm x 15cm, then, with a knife or dough scraper, cut it into thirds and stack them on top of each other. Turn 90 degrees, then repeat the rolling and cutting twice more, dusting with flour if the dough sticks to the pin or work surface. For the final stack, put the smoothest third on top. Press down to adhere the layers – it should be around 20cm x 14cm by this stage. Trim the outside of the dough to create clean edges, then cut the dough into six equal 6cm x 6cm squares, each weighing (75-85g. (Save and bake any offcuts as snacks.)Transfer the squares to a tray lined with baking paper, leaving 5cm space between each shortcake, then put in the freezer while you heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. (Alternatively, rest the shortcakes in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 24 hours.) Brush the tops with buttermilk, scatter over the granulated sugar, then bake for 20-22 minutes, until crisp and golden. Remove and leave to cool slightly on the tray.To finish, whip the yoghurt, sugar and cream to stiff peaks. Split each shortcake in half, spoon about 30g of the yoghurt cream on top, followed by four or five slices of mango and a grating of lime zest (if the mango is a bit underpowered, toss it with lime juice first). Top with the shortcake lid, add another spoonful of cream, a few slices of mango and a final grating of zest, and serve immediately.Pistachio tiramisuView image in fullscreenNicola Lamb’s pistachio tiramisu.Splashing out on superbly green Iranian or Sicilian pistachios will give you the most dramatic, golf-club green finish, though any will taste just as good. You will need a 20cm x 20cm tin.Prep10 minCook45 minChill4 hr+Serves8250g mascarpone200ml double cream180g pistachio cream– I useBlack Milk4 egg whites(about 120g)¼ tsp flaky salt70g caster sugarAbout 30 ladyfingers, AKA sponge fingers or savoiardi400ml strong brewed coffee, cooled to room temperatureCocoa powder, for dusting75g pistachiosIn a large bowl, whip the mascarpone and double cream to stiff peaks. Add the pistachio cream and whip again until well combined.In a second bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy, then add the flaky salt and sugar, and whip again to voluminous stiff peaks that look like shiny shaving foam.Loosen the cream and pistachio mixture with four or five tablespoons of the meringue – mix it in and beat enthusiastically: the mixture should relax a little, making it easier to fold in the rest of the meringue and retain as much air as possible. In three instalments, gently fold in the remaining meringue with a flat spatula or whisk, leaving you with a strong-looking but airy mixture.Dip each ladyfinger one by one into the coffee for just two or three seconds, then use these to line the base of a 20cm x 20cm tin. Dust lightly with cocoa powder.​​Pile half the tiramisu cream (about 400g) on top and smooth with an offset spatula or the back of a spoon. Repeat with the sponge-dunking and layering, dust with more cocoa powder, then pile the remaining cream on top. Smooth the top, cover and chill for at least four hours, and ideally overnight or up to two days.Blitz the pistachios to a fine crumb in a food processor, then scatter all over the top of the tiramisu before serving.Nicola Lamb is a pastry chef and author of the weeklyKitchen Projectsnewsletter and Sift, published by Ebury Press at £30.
