She doesn’t wear a tutu to fill goons with lead thoughPeter BradshawWed 4 Jun 2025 18.00 EDTShareThat title could cause confusion. The film might accidentally tap into the Frozen customer-base, and millions of wide-eyed little girls in sparkly tutus and tiaras will show up at cinemas with their mums and dads to watch Keanu Reeves let a heavy-set gangster have it in the chops with a round from his specially customised Glock. Well, the confusion is deliberate. Here, the delicacy of ballet and the violence of martial arts are conflated. In this new spin-off feature from Keanu’s John Wick action franchise – an auxiliary episode on the timeline, between Wick episodes Three andFour, when JW was lying low, recovering from injuries – a mysterious new action-slash-classical-dance heroine called Eve now grands-jetés her way into the franchise, played by the always stylish Ana de Armas. JW veteran Shay Hatten writes the screenplay and Len Wiseman directs.The central idea returns me an old maxim of mine: people who call action scenes in films “balletic” have never seen a ballet, or indeed a fight, in their lives. Yet I was sort of hoping that de Armas’s ballerina Eve Macarro would put the smackdown on a couple of dozen goons while up on pointe. Sadly no. But I do have to admit that de Armas carries off the essential silliness of Ballerina and, after her performance as Paloma in No Time to Die opposite Daniel Craig’s 007, she proves again she can do action, in both couture and daytime wear; she can also carry out the time-honoured lightning-fast choreography of removing a clip from an automatic weapon, inspecting its contents, smacking it back into position with the heel of her palm and then filling someone full of lead.Eve is inducted into the way of violence as a little kid, like Natalie Portman’s badass moppet in Luc Besson’s Léon, or indeed like John Wick himself; she is secretly trained in weaponry and martial arts at the same time as she is schooled in ballet, the rigour and discipline of which are considered to be complementary to those of beating the jeepers out of someone. It happened after her dad was whacked by a mysterious cult led by a dead-eyed creep called the Chancellor (Gabriel Byrne), and the plucky orphan is taken in by the Ruska Roma group led by Anjelica Huston’s implacable Director, and grows to womanhood in this strange, dysfunctional ballet-plus-violence organisation whose income apparently derives from assassination fees. But Eve has always nursed a desire for revenge against the weird tribe who killed her dad.FourJohn Wickfilms with Keanu fetishising his guns and sporting his increasingly werewolfy facial hair have been increasingly heavy going but now de Armas mixes things up and she is a smart screen presence. As for the ballet, the emphasis is on Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake; nothing wrong with that, of course, but if the Ballerina sub-franchise continues, let’s hope that different works are chosen and we see de Armas actually getting out there on stage in a tutu as opposed to simply racking up the kills.Ballerina is out on 6 June in Australia and the US, and on 7 June in the UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersAction and adventure filmsAna de ArmasAnjelica HustonGabriel ByrneIan McShanereviewsShareReuse this content"

A level of success to whichKemi Badenochcan only aspire right now. We’ve reached the point where her having a decent stab at approximating some intelligent questions goes down as an unmitigated triumph. Not that it really matters any more.To care about the Tory leader’s performances at prime minister’s questions is to commit a category error. She has become an irrelevance both to Labour and her own MPs. Possibly even to herself. Though that might require a level of personal insight that is beyond her.Two weeks ago, KemiKaze failed to notice thatKeir Starmerhad already U-turned on the winter fuel allowance and repeatedly asked him when he was going to U-turn. Not her finest hour. Some of her frontbench colleagues were almost in tears. Though Robert Jenrick was crying with laughter. You can see why he has been keeping up the perma-campaign to take her job. She never fails to keep giving him reasonable grounds for hope.Badenoch challenges Starmer at PMQs over winter fuel payment U-turn, Chagos deal and child benefit cap – UK politics liveRead moreAt Wednesday’sPMQsKemi was back asking about the winter fuel allowance again. For reasons best known to herself, she has got it into her head that the only reason Starmer backtracked was down to her demanding that he did a fortnight previously. It hasn’t occurred to her that public opinion and some extremely grumpy Labour MPs might have been rather more prominent in Keir’s mind. He really doesn’t need to dance to the beat of a party that is trailing the Lib Dems and Reform in some polls.“Glad you’re catching up,” Keir said cheerily. But only a little. Kemi was still a fortnight behind everyone else. And she clearly hadn’t been listening to the chancellor’s speech earlier that morning in which she had indicated that the new means-tested thresholdwould be in place in time for next winter’s payments. Labour had been right to stabilise the economy first, Starmer continued.The mention of the £22bn black hole seemed to derange Kemi. She started yelling “chaos, chaos, chaos”. You’d have thought she would have got used to Starmer not really answering her questions in the way she would like by now. Would have factored that into her attack lines. Yet she continues to take it as a personal affront. And her accusations of chaos fell flat. Because not every U-turn is a sign of chaos. Sometimes it’s pragmatism. You make one choice with one set of circumstances. And if they change, then you make another. It’s how most people live their lives.“Chaos, chaos, chaos,” Kemi shouted. She moved on to the two-child benefit limit. What did Starmer believe in? She believed fervently in child poverty, she said. More or less. Most charities and thinktanks had concluded that lifting the cap would be the most effective way of lifting children out of poverty.But that was not a Britain that KemiKaze wanted to see. Far better to make some children pay for the sins of their parents. If some hard-up families couldn’t restrict themselves to just two kids then the third one deserved to starve to death. Because that would teach it a lesson. That was Kemi’s way. That was the Conservative way. Babies born to be scroungers were a blight on all of us. It was an unusual take for a party leader. But I guess George Osborne would have been cheering her on.“I know what I believe in,” said Kemi. We all know what she believes in. The last thing that she read on social media. “But the prime minister has to look in his own folder to know what he believes in.” This came out as a torrent. As if she thought it was her best line of the day. Only she hadn’t quite realised she herself had just read it out of her own folder. Sometimes her handlers must despair. Wrangling Kemi is a thankless task. She has no idea she is her own worst enemy.Not that this was a vintage performance from Starmer by any means. But it didn’t need to be. He no longer regards Badenoch as a serious opponent. Just a mild irritation who will sooner or later no longer be around to bother him. Maybe he’s even getting just a bit too casual. Not spending quite as long preparing for this weekly set piece as he used to. Other more pressing things on his mind. His barbs and repartee sometimes lapsing into outright condescension. Not a good look.Mostly Keir just ignored whatever Kemi had to say and used his slots for his own soundbites. Kemi was on the side of the Russian on Chagos. Which is almost true. Only she and Putin have described it as a sellout. The US and our allies seem to be in favour. She was also a Russian stooge over Ukraine. Probably unfair.But she should learn to think before she speaks in future so that her words can’t be twisted. Though that’s not her style. She chose to end in self-immolation with a critique of the trade deal with the US. She didn’t seem to know that we were paying less in steel tariffs than the rest of the world.As so often these days, it was the Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, who appeared to be the real opposition. Certainly Starmer accords him greater bandwidth and credibility. Davey is the only leader to talk of Donald Trump in the same way as the rest of the country. An unstable president who cannot be trusted to keep his word on anything. That must hurt Keir. Because he knows it’s true.The only other highlight of a dismal session was a first question from the new Reform MP, Sarah Pochin, who wasted no time in establishing her xenophobic credentials by calling for a ban on the burqa. Maybe she would like nuns to go bare-headed as well. Starmer refused to engage. Merely pointing out that as she had in a former life been a supporter of Liz Truss, then maybe she was fully behind Reform’s economic plans to bankrupt the country.We ended with a point of order from Tory Jesse Norman. It was fine when Conservative prime ministers failed to answer any questions, he said. But it was beyond the pale for a Labour leader to do the same. The speaker merely observed that the purpose of PMQs had never been for the prime minister to answer questions. It was performative sideshow. And an opportunity for Kemi to express her existential futility in interpretive dance.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochThe politics sketchKeir StarmerPMQsFuel povertyHouse of CommonscommentShareReuse this content"

It was joyous and completely overwhelming. It was that same iconic Rose Tyler smile that got me – the one we last saw when she was reunited with the Doctor in 2008. Like many others, I was a child when I was introduced to Doctor Who in 2005 and it was unquestionably Rose Tyler who hooked me in, and that transcendental love story. I have been a fan of Piper ever since and hope, for old times’ sake, we get to see her again with David Tennant’s 14th Doctor.Steph Braithwaite, 31,communityrelations manager, Toxteth, Liverpool‘I was pretty surprised to see her pop up’I heard a rumour about the Doctor regenerating into Billie but quickly dismissed it as a joke, so I was pretty surprised to see her pop up. Note that in the credits she wasn’t listed as the Doctor. If the rumours are true, the show is likely to be rested for a good few years. So I’m thinking that getting Billie was probably a last-minute inclusion to get everyone talking and ensure the show didn’t go out with a whimper. As for the future of the show, stick it on at 9pm. I think it needs to appeal to an older audience (like me) – I’m thinking more like X-Files. Make it dark, scary and occasionally funny. Just not sexy, please.Mike, 48, productdesigner, Montreal‘Despite my reservations, this manoeuvre was excellently bizarre’Christopher Eccleston, the former Doctor, vouched for this at a conventionthree years ago– partly, he said, because he wanted to see how fans would process such a move. Despite my reservations around the episode and this era more broadly, this manoeuvre is an excellently bizarre one, but I’m also confident it wasn’t “always the plan” as has been suggested. Regardless of what is next, the upcoming spin-off looks excellent. Russell T Davies, an incredibly ambitious writer and a visionary, has clearly had to navigate his vision for this era around various obstacles: Disney’s lack of commitment to a further series, the pressure this puts on an up-and-coming cast, and the mammoth task of revitalising a franchise which can, and has, been phenomenally successful. What I want to see, really, is for Doctor Who to start challenging for mass appeal again.Ben, 23, London‘Billie will bring me back’I had become tired of the show and haven’t watched more than one or two episodes in the last five years, which is very sad but I just wasn’t excited by it any more. I had been a devotedDoctor Whofan since Tom Baker but that died with Capaldi and Whittaker. Billie will bring me back – I hope she will be the next Doctor.Mary, 71, retired, USView image in fullscreen‘I had been a devoted Doctor Who fan since Tom Baker but that died with Capaldi and Whittaker’ … Jodie Whittaker in the finale to Doctor Who’s latest series.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/James Pardon‘The show needs a break – just having a familiar face returning isn’t enough’Billie Piper was never a great companion in my view but many did love her as Rose. If she is set to play the Doctor then she needs to be a very different character type,more in line with a Missythan a 13th Doctor. I do not know if she can do that. There are so many good actors in the UK that could play the character of an alien without trying too hard, something previous Doctors appeared to do, but the last few haven’t felt authentic. I believe they need a break, perhaps about five years, before the next series. In that time the show executives and writers can create something special. Just having a familiar face returning, in whatever capacity, isn’t enough.Mandy, Midlands‘There is something unnerving about taking on the form of a previous love interest and wearing their skin as a suit’In all honesty, I’m a bit unsure how I feel. There are elements of it that makes sense, however, there is something unnerving about taking on the form of a previous love interest and wearing their skin as a suit. I hope it’s not just gimmicky – perhaps if there are links back to the Bad Wolf storyline that originated for the ninth Doctor then it may work. However, at the moment it does feel like trying to float a sinking ship. I say this as somebody who has loved Doctor Who since I was a child. Time will tell, but I hope this isn’t just another cheap trick to keep us interested. Russell T Davies don’t let us down!Gabrielle, freelance photographer and video editor, Bristol‘I feel for Ncuti Gatwa whose entrance and exit have been overshadowed by nostalgia grabs’I am honestly fine with her being the next Doctor – it could be very interesting. However, I feel forNcuti Gatwa, whose entrance and exit have been overshadowed by nostalgia grabs. The entire season was set up for viral moments and not storytelling, but this is meant to be swept under the carpet because guess who is back? Billie Piper! Let the team remind you of when Doctor Who was interesting and you cared about the characters, but don’t mind the fact they are going to force a companion we barely care about to now have a child. Don’t mind the fact the doctor has a complete personality change and gaslights and belittles Ruby. Don’t mind the fact women in that season were treated terribly. We have another female Doctor to make all the bad writing seem unimportant.Rachel, 25, research assistant in data science and clinical trials, St Albans‘The last thing the audience wants is to get attached for what five minutes before losing anotherDoctor’I think it feels tired and creatively bankrupt. On its own, it might have felt exciting or refreshing, but after the 60th specials and the number of throwbacks throughout the last two seasons, it feels as if the creative team are barely capable of looking forward. I’d like Billie to at least take on the role properly and have much more screen time. The last thing the audience wants, after so many regenerations since the episode Power of the Doctor, and such a sadly short stint for Ncuti, is to get attached for what feels like five minutes before losing another Doctor. I just feel worn out from it all.Zach, 24, student, AberystwythView image in fullscreen‘The Ncuti Gatwa series were the worst series I’ve ever seen’ … Gatwa in the Doctor Who finale.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/James Pardon‘The only thing I’m upset about is how poorly parts of the fandom reacted’I’m shocked, but in a good way. Billie Piper is such an integral part of NuWho history and the credits didn’t introduce her as the Doctor, so the opportunities are endless (is she the Bad Wolf? Or the Moment?). I’m really excited to see what comes next and hope the show gets renewed. The only thing I’m upset about is how poorly parts of the fandom reacted. To bring back old characters is such a Doctor Who thing to do. I have the feeling that loads of people forgot what the show is about: it’s fun, it’s full of heart and it’s always been a little bit wacky, so why not embrace this new development with an open mind? As the Doctor himself said: “Hate is always foolish, love is always wise.” It would be great if people took that to heart.Isa, Germany‘I just want the show to be good and entertaining’This is what Doctor Who should be like – where there is an air of mystery about it, not where they advertise who the new Doctor is months in advance. I am not worried if this is a brief appearance or if she is the new Doctor. I am only worried about whether the show can pull it off well and do a respectable job with it. I just want the show to be good and entertaining.Karl, Australia‘It was a shock’It was a shock seeing Ncuti regenerate into Rose Tyler. Firstly, this was the first regeneration that didn’t seem to cause any pain to the Doctor. Secondly, the regeneration energy being dissipated by his clothes and then Billie saying hello made it more confusing as normally the Doctor does not know what face they will get. I think Doctor Who is going on a hiatus and Billie is not the actual 16th incarnation. I guess we’ll have to wait.MuhammadHashmi, student, Pakistan‘The show needs a break of at least 10 years so Russell T Davies has nothing to do with it’The Ncuti Gatwa series were the worst series of Doctor Who I’ve ever seen, and I’ve followed it since 1963. Billie Piper’s return was an act of desperation. I would like the show to have a break of at least 10 years so that Russell T Davies and his production team have nothing to do with it.Stephen John Mitchell, 70, retired, Carlisle‘IfDoctorWho is to continue it needs new ideas’I have nothing against Billie Piper. She is a wonderful actor and if she wasn’t so ingrained in the show she would be on my shortlist to play the 16th Doctor. But she is as much a part of it as David Tennant and Catherine Tate are. Falling back on nostalgia every two years won’t help the show survive. If it’s to continue to be the crown jewel of the BBC that it’s been for the best part of 20 years, it needs new ideas. A new format for its distribution to help it fit with TV in 2025. Maybe a self-contained five-episode run that can be binged?Olly, 33, musician, ManchesterExplore more on these topicsDoctor WhoBillie PiperTelevisionFantasy TVNcuti GatwafeaturesShareReuse this content"

What actually happens in the world of movie reporting can be yet more murkyWed 4 Jun 2025 10.04 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 12.56 EDTShareIt is no surprise that Austrian newspaper Kurier’sClint Eastwoodinterview went viral over the weekend. An audience with a 95-year-old film legend containing stern words about the current state of cinema was always going to go like a rocket. Particularly during the industry’s dregs season: the thin period post Cannes and pre the summer proper, with Mission: Impossible fever fading fast and Lilo & Stitch ruling the box office – a success from which only so many stories can be spun.Further evidence of this thinness comes from a quick scan of the news stories run over the past week in some of the trade magazines – Variety, Hollywood Reporter, Deadline, Screen International – who must keep producing them, regardless of actual material. These include a write-off of an interview in which Michael Cera says he didn’t think Jackie Chan knew who he was when they first met, Renée Zellweger revealing that she shed a tear shooting the Bridget Jones film that was released last February and – an exclusive, this – a report that Bill Murray will appear at a film festival in Croatia. Against this backdrop, Eastwood telling younger directors to buck up is, basically, Watergate.Yet the waves the interview made do appear to have come as a surprise to the publication in which it ran. And, in a way, that itself is no surprise, for most of the apparatus of film journalism remains weirdly rooted in a pre-internet era, one in which Google translate doesn’t exist and 18 sets of roundtable interviews, conducted over at least a decade, can absolutely constitute a new article.Clint Eastwood calls viral interview a fabrication: ‘Entirely phony’Read moreWhat the paper does regret, according to itsstatement, is suggesting it was an “interview” rather than a “birthday profile”, implying that the writer, Elisabeth Sereda, mis-sold them her access – which is why they will no longer be working with her.If this is true, it raises further questions. Interviews of this nature generally involve considerable back and forth (say 150 emails) between a commissioning editor, writer, picture editors, film publicist, personal publicist and more. Assuming none of these happened, it still feels concerning that the paper never confirmed when, where or how Sereda spoke to such a major, reticent – and elderly – star.View image in fullscreenDenzel Washington speaks with press on the red carpet at the Highest 2 Lowest premiere in Cannes.Photograph: Manon Cruz/ReutersMore confusingly, as well as describing its writer’s approach to quote-gathering as basically kosher, Kurier’s statement goes on to further tout her credentials. Sereda, it says, “has been in the Hollywood business for decades, conducting interviews with the biggest stars … Her closeness to them is undoubtedly well known.“This is also due, among other things, to the fact that Sereda is a member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the association that awards the Golden Globes and reports from Hollywood for international media.”The Hollywood Foreign Press is a defunct organisation, disbanded in 2023 after decades of accusations of unprofessionalism, bribery and misconduct by some of its members – international showbiz writers of hazy credentials and uncertain identity.The Golden Globes, which it did indeed dish out, were so discredited that they were boycotted by publicists, stars and broadcasters, and the association then had to issue multiple apologies for its lack of transparency and diversity (not a single black writer), before relaunching a couple of years ago.Austrian newspaper cuts ties with writer over Clint Eastwood ‘exclusive’Read moreWriters such as Sereda and many of the original members of the HFPA – like many film journalists, many of them reporters of integrity and expertise – rely to a greater or lesser extent on access granted at film festivals. This access is brief, chaotic and non-exclusive. When I worked for another publication 20-odd years ago, I remember being at such roundtables involving one or two stars and perhaps a dozen sharp-elbowed correspondents from countries across the world.After a bruising 20 minutes, you would be left with a challenging tombola of quotes about, perhaps, an especially niche style of cinematography, whether the star might one day visit Latvia and a lot of bland waffle about how marvellous the director was. Getting a question of your own in was rare. Getting a good piece out of the results was rarer.It is possible to make a living on such access, if you trot around all the festivals – Sundance, Berlin, Cannes, Venice, Toronto – and remain in favour with a couple of publications, and, most crucially, the publicists. A certain level of sycophancy is essential – and, happily, appears to be far from a stretch for many of the writers. Sereda’s Instagram page, for instance, is populated by wide-smiled selfies of her with assorted A-listers. These are posted in the event of a new interview, a new movie or their death.Such unabashed celeb-worship is absolutely common practice in film journalism, even among the most respected Hollywood pundits. I remember one brilliant writer who would post a selfie with a recently deceased star with such speed after news broke of their death that the gesture morphed from the morbid into the faintly suspicious. Could it be that they were the common factor behind all these tragedies?Thick skins, malleable standards and dribble: this is how a lot of this world works. Luckily, the Guardian is a publication with sufficient leverage that it does not need to rely on roundtable access – and would generally not accept it, unless for background, ahead of a 1:1. But much of the access that we are often offered and the circumstances of it is, still, sausage factory stuff: you probably don’t want to know.That roundtables persist is evidence of how much the film industry remains wedded to print publicity. Twenty years ago, the same ragbag quotes appearing in an Austrian broadsheet as well as, say, a Swedish film quarterly and an Australian celebrity magazine, would have gone unnoticed. Today, it makes much less sense. But despite the primacy of streamers and, more broadly, the whole tech-revolution of the past two decades, online versions of articles are of much less concern to publicists than the print version.Juror #2: the curious case of the missing Clint Eastwood filmRead moreWhy? Because clients need presenting with something concrete, a hard glossy copy with a pre-approved photo of themselves on the cover – even if this is seen by perhaps 100th of the people who will read it online. That this is still the case is something I find very curious.Yet maybe the clients are changing. It was, after all, none other than Eastwood himself who first flagged the dodginess of the Kurier article. He had, in fact, said all those things. He just hadn’t said them recently, or knowingly given an audience to that writer, for that newspaper.A new interview with him would be gold-dust because Eastwood did not do press for his most recent movie, Juror #2, which went straight to streaming in the US, after rumours of a rift between the director and the incoming head of studio Warner, David Zaslav (Eastwood didn’t even show up to the premiere).Was Eastwood – now shooting his new movie – concerned these historic quotes would be interpreted as a broadside against Zaslav? Or is he, in his 10th decade, simply paying more attention than the rest of us?Explore more on these topicsFilm industryFilm criticismNewspapersClint EastwoodanalysisShareReuse this content"

Is that because of what the country is doing now – or its socialist past?Zoe WilliamsWed 4 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 11.12 EDTShareMuch of the world doesn’t have a clue what to do about child poverty, or even when to do it. In the UK the Labour government recentlydelayed its flagship policyon tackling the issue until the autumn. But if you’re looking for inspiration, it might be worth asking what Slovenia has been getting right. The country has the lowest rates of child poverty in Europe.Why? The glaringly obvious reason is thatSloveniais a very economically equal country. “The heritage of the social state, from communist times, is still here,” says Marta Gregorčič, a professor at the Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development, which addresses household distress and poverty.However, this is more than a broad-spectrum equality story. There is a deep, stated commitment to eradicating child poverty in Slovenia, and you can read that in various and sometimes counterintuitive ways. There is anational action planfor children across all kinds of metrics: affordable early years care; educational inclusivity, particularly for Roma children; protective measures on mental health; access to housing – which is transparent and prioritised. The country has “very strong humanitarian and civil organisations,” says Gregorčič, but Slovenians also take as given that it is everyone’s job to make sure kids don’t get siloed by social class. And then, seeing one of those organisations up close, one driver of the country’s success surfaces constantly: they are never satisfied; one child in poverty is too many.The numbers speak for themselves – the amount of children at risk of deprivation in Slovenia is 10.3%, just under half the EU average of 24.4%, according toEurostat. The UK is no longer included in these figures, but for comparison, a separateUnicef studyfound that the UK was third from bottom of the OECD in 2021, and that only Turkish and Colombian children were more likely to be living below the poverty line. Slovenia, in that study? Still first.I’m here to visitZveza Anita Ogulin & ZPM(ZPM for short), a children’s charity in the east of Ljubljana, in a set of low-rise municipal buildings on a tidy, grass-banked street whose name translates as Proletarian Road. Doris Rojo, its head of communications, is annoyed that it gets these buildings rent-free from the state, but has to pay rent on the larger site opposite, which houses a community centre and food bank.Rojo refers frequently to the “socialism that is left from the past”, to explain many features of a Slovenian childhood: the custom of cooked meals at school that lots of children don’t pay for, for instance, or the idea that kids have a right to a holiday, by the sea or in the mountains, and no one would think of organising a group trip that didn’t include a cross-section of social classes. “This was considered part of life,” Rojo says. “Everyone went on holiday, at least once a year. The state even owned apartments by the sea, available for workers on reduced terms.” Somehow, capitalism never attained the status of inevitability or modernity in Slovenian policy discourse – just a different way of doing things, that is only sometimes better. When they call a street after the proletariat, they don’t mean that in a bad way.View image in fullscreenA girl and her father follow their homemade boats during an event to celebrate the arrival of spring in Ljubljana.Photograph: Xinhua/Alamy“Social protection policy in Slovenia has always quite strongly supported families and children,” Gregorčič says, noting that female workforce participation has a long history, going back to the second world war. “All these policies for women in the labour market, all the subsidies for parental leave, I believe contribute to a lower risk of poverty.” She goes on to list these assistances and allowances: “maternity and paternity leave at 100% pay; the right to reduced working hours; a childbirth grant; breastfeeding breaks; allowances for large families; allowances for childcare if you have children with disabilities; quite a significant child allowance – €115 a month for the first child in low income households”.Policy, history and social cohesion interact in subtle ways. Female workforce participation has also created a tradition of grandparental childcare, but family help is only part of the picture. Peter Wostner, a policy expert at the Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development, describes this geographically. “We’re a very small country, which internally is very diverse. To give you a flavour – there are 33 or 34 regions within Slovenia by which people principally identify themselves – a similar number of different dialects, different cuisines, different everything. Why am I mentioning that? Because of that element of community, the networks within these areas are strong.” Perhaps more generous attitudes created the conditions for a solid social safety net, or perhaps the security creates more generosity, or more likely they’re in a feedback loop.Covid triggered a scramble for emergency support common to many European nations, but its aftermath brought on a deeper consideration of the struggles many working families faced here. In 2021, a new child welfare advisory group was formed made up of NGOs, the local Unicef branch and the government-funded Social Protection Institute. Among other things, it consulted 37 children aged 12 to 15 from all over Slovenia, who made proposals on a draft child guarantee action plan. It had fast, concrete results – 13,000 of the most deprived children were guaranteed computer access by 2024 – and the overall finding was that they needed a “social protection system for the entire family, not only for the child in need within the family. After all, a child is part of a family and shares the same fate as its other members.” Maybe that sounds obvious, that you can’t get serious about children’s dignity and life chances if you’re not also serious about their parents’ wages and rents.View image in fullscreenChildren on a holiday organised by the Anita Ogulin & ZPM Association.Economists like Gregorčič will acknowledge the “strong social protections for families”, but she immediately moves on to stubborn pockets of deprivation: “the migrants, Roma, the homeless, the erased”. (When Slovenia declared independence in 1991, 25,000 people were removed from the registry of permanent residents, thereby losing social and civil rights, and disappearing from the statistics). “There were 5,000 children among them, and now they are grown up,” Gregorčič continues, “but it is still a huge problem, the marginalised groups who are missing from the statistics.”The assembled team at ZPM – Rojo, plus Tea Dorić, a social worker, Julija Mišič, the communications lead, and Živa Logar, programme coordinator – also give short shrift to the child-poverty rankings, because the numbers are going in the wrong direction. “We still have 41,000 children living under the poverty line,” Rojo says, “and these are not just numbers, they are people.” Slovenia’s population is small – two million; if that were scaled up to a UK-sized population, it would equate to 1.5 million kids. In fact, in the UK there are4.5 millionchildren living in poverty, almost a third. It’s almost as if our runaway numbers have washed away our seriousness of purpose.Dorić is technically not a social worker but a social pedagogue – a more holistic form of careworker, concerned with equality and relationships as much as material needs. A lot of European countries practise social pedagogy (Poland, Hungary, Spain, Germany), which if you describe it conceptually sounds kind of: “Meh, don’t we all do that?” You need examples to really get it. Yvalia Febrer, an associate professor of social work at Kingston University, offered this: “In the UK, you’ll get a social worker who will say, ‘I’m little Jonny’s social worker, I’m not your social worker, even though you’re his mum. I’m not interested in your housing issues … I’m just looking athisneeds, and whether they’re being met. If you’re not able to meet them, then that’s neglect.’ A social pedagogue will say: ‘If the problem is housing, let’s fix the housing.’”Dorić is the first social pedagogue I’ve met in real life, and she is everything about that model you would dream of: fierce, imaginative, indefatigable, humane. “We are trying to say to the wider public, children are not inherently bad. They’re amazing, they’re so loving and smart, they are doing regular things.” Mišič chimes in: “Society is bad, not the children. Our parents can’t pay the bills, they can’t buy food, they can’t go on holiday, they are alone.”ZPM started as a charity providing holidays, nearly 70 years ago, but it has expanded its mission to provide a range of services – extra tuition, financial support, therapy, youth groups, food parcels (particularly during Covid) and financial advice. “It’s hard to tell someone how to better manage their finances if you know that they don’t have enough. Families will spend a long time walking the line of just about meeting their family’s needs, and then one crisis, and the debt keeps on growing. It snowballs,” Mišič says.That collective memory of a socialist past cuts two ways. “There is a perception that people who are employed cannot be poor. People find it hard to imagine even when it’s happening to them,” Mišič continues. Rojo says the stats are lagging the reality: “But what we are facing really, is that the children we’re working with, who are now in poor families, are mainly those where one or both parents work.”View image in fullscreenThis year’s international ‘Play with Me’ festival in Ljubljana was attended by the Slovenian prime minister, Robert Golob.Photograph: Natasa Kupljenik/MI-PRESS/ShutterstockAcross the road from ZPM, at the youth and community centre, Nuša Lesar, a well-known TV presenter, is running a workshop for teenagers; behind that, there’s a food bank, crates of identical flour and supplies, plainly corporately donated; in a third room, I met Vedran Jovanovski, 14, and Tamara Grozden Mirosavlejevič, 11. Vedran is a migrant from North Macedonia; his father is a barber, his mother was a social worker but has to retrain to work in Slovenia. They moved two and a half years ago. His English is excellent, as is his Slovenian. “For older people, like my mum, it’s more difficult. But it’s not that hard.” He wants to be an engineer or an architect, and already dresses like one – natty skinny trousers and a blazer.“We had our own house in Macedonia; my dad had his own barber shop. We had everything, but the situation there is not good,” he says. (The country is politically turbulent and riven with corruption.) “We didn’t come here with friends – we just decided on our own to move and got here, didn’t know anything. But we kind of fitted in with people, and with society.” Tamara is quieter. Her mother is a doctor, her father died a few years ago. She loves to dance and teaches younger children traditional Slovenian moves, but both of them come to the children’s centre for extra tutoring. She doesn’t want to be a doctor because she can’t stand the sight of blood, but that’s as far as she’s got on the career planning, which is fair enough. She’s only 11.A core principle of the children’s centre, the holidays, the third sector overall, is that kids shouldn’t be excluded from anything because of their income or class, whether that’s TV workshops or computers or holidays by the sea.In so many ways, the Slovenian story traces that of western democracies everywhere: welfare states have been contracting since the financial crisis. That might show up immediately as a direct impact – Gregorčič describes “restrictive measures straight after the financial crash, which stopped child allowances being a human right; they became a social right. At that time, childhood poverty rose a lot.” Or it might show up over time as wage erosion and underfunded public services, and that arc would be familiar across a large number of countries.But where Slovenia differs is in the amount of child deprivation it will tolerate. “We know they are not hungry at school,” Gregorčič says. “We have free meals in school. We know they are surviving, to say it really harshly. But I, for example, am not proud.” Child poverty isn’t the only area where Slovenia ranks high; it’sone of the safest countries in the world; it has the third largest share of forests in Europe. “Five years ago, we started not even comparing ourselves to the EU average [for social health indicators],” Wostner says. “We benchmark ourselves against the innovators. We’re not interested in the US model, we’re not interested in the Asian model – we’re going in the direction of the social innovation leaders, which is the Nordic model.” I met no one who celebrated having the fewest deprived children in Europe; it seems you can’t get this right unless your target figure is zero.Explore more on these topicsChildrenEuro visionsPovertySloveniaEuropeSocial carefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trail running is a different beast, offering all the same positives with different challenges and potentially even more rewards.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ve been running trails for almost two decades, from the runnable tracks of the New Forest to the steep, technical trails around Mont Blanc, running everything from trail 10kms to 100-mile ultras. It allows me to unplug completely, tap into the mental health benefits of spending time in nature and get a double dose of strength and cardio.Any run that takes you off the tarmac on to unpaved surfaces can be considered “hitting the trails”. That could be anything from fields and dirt paths in your local park to forest trails, and the more technical – and taxing – coastal paths or mountainous terrain. These adventures test your mind and body, battling uneven terrain, elevation changes and obstacles such as rocks, roots and streams.The good news: you don’t need loads of specialised kit to take your runs off-road. But some important items can make life much easier.Here’s my shortlist of the trail running essentials you need to enjoy your miles in the wild. Starting with the most important item of all – your trail running shoes.My favourite trail running gearView image in fullscreenPhotograph: SrdjanPav/Getty ImagesThe best trail running shoes forbeginnersChoosing the right shoes is mission-critical. You can buy shoes that carefully target types of terrain, but as a beginner, you’re probably looking for a good all-rounder. The trail shoes I’ve recommended below offer enough versatility to cater for your early adventures off-road.View image in fullscreenMerrell Morphlite trainersMen’s£70 at Blacks£100 at MerrellWomen’s£80 at Sports Direct£100 at MerrellLow on price, high on versatility, Merrell’s road-to-trail all-rounder handles the switch from tarmac to trail with ease. It’s a simple, winning mix of lightweight fuss-free comfort, good protection and a mildly responsive ride. Soft enough for the road but stable and reliable for the trails, too. The shallow lugs don’t cope so well when things get wet, muddy and sloppy, but for tamer trails, these are a great option.View image in fullscreenOn Cloudsurfer trail trainersMen’s£120 at Runners Need£150 at OnWomen’s£115 at Runners Need£150 at OnAnother shoe that strides seamlessly from asphalt to lighter trails, the Cloudsurfer trail retains some road-shoe DNA in a beginner-friendly trail shoe. It’s good at handling less technical, rolling or flat terrain, with a nice balance of cushion and protection in a relatively lightweight, agile package. It’s an easy long hauler that won’t weigh you down. Definitely suits runners logging their first tentative trail miles.View image in fullscreenMerrell Agility Peak 5 shoesMen’sFrom £79.97 at Millets£140 at MerrellWomen’s£140 at Merrell£140 at SchuhThis excellent utility off-roader serves up controlled cushioning and good protection from the lumps and bumps of the trail with reliable stability and excellent grip from the 5mm lugs. The well-cushioned midsole offers lots of energy for clipping along compacted trails and is soft enough to cruise the road miles to the trail. An all-round excellent trail workhorse for rolling road-to-trail terrain. Also consider theHoka Speedgoat 6, which provides a very similar ride.View image in fullscreenAsics Gel Trabuco Max 4 trainersMen’s£160 at Go Outdoors£160 at AsicsWomen’s£159.95 at Runners Need£160 at AsicsWith a bigger-stack, high-cushioned midsole, plush padded heels and a roomy toe box, the Trabuco Max 4 is all about cruising, easy comfort at slower paces.

For many longer trail races, they’re obligatory. Look for a jacket with taped seams, a higher hydrostatic head rating and a good breathability score. But also think about waterproof pockets, cap-friendly hoods, windproof cuffs and how small they can pack up.Three jackets that tick most of those boxes are the North Face Summit Superior Futurelight jacket, the Inov8 Stormshell FZ V2 and the Montane Minimus Lite.

They combine two large, zippered leg pockets and an integrated storage belt in the waistband that has four large mesh drop-in pockets. They’re ideal for storing fuel, a phone or a head torch within easy reach. They can even swallow a 600ml soft flask. I ran 1,830 miles across Europe – a marathon a day for 67 days – in a single pair of these, and not only were they excellent for day-to-day comfort in some gruelling conditions, but they’re still going strong now.View image in fullscreenWomen’s Kiprun Run 500shorts£12.99 at DecathlonYou’ll never regret adding a no-nonsense utility short to your running wardrobe, and these Kiprun trail shorts are all about simple versatility. They’re cut from a light, airy and fast-drying fabric and happily work for trail, track or pavement. There’s decent storage with four pockets – one with a key hook, one zippered back pocket for holstering your phone and two less useful side pockets. Plus, a soft, lined drawstring waistband to keep everything comfy and where it should be. A do-it-all everyday short that will also work when things get warmer.A hydration vestView image in fullscreenThe North Face Summit Run 5L vest£134.99 at SportsShoes£135 at the North FaceYou often need to carry more gear when running off the beaten track – and that includes water. The best way to port fluids is in a hydration vest. This five-litre option has an adjustable fit for little to no bounce. There’s good storage with two front holsters for soft flasks, stretchy stash pouches, a zippered front pocket big enough to hold a phone and a main compartment that can store a jacket. It’s just as good for long road runs and running daily errands.A dry bagView image in fullscreenSilva Terra 3L dry bag£11.99 at TrekittFrom £12.95 at Outdoor ActionA dry bag isn’t 100% essential, but it’s extraordinarily handy. Most running vests aren’t waterproof, and they rarely stop the back sweat from soiling your gear. A dry bag guarantees that what is in your pack stays in tip-top condition. This Silva Terra 3L dry bag is a good option for smaller packs.Open-ear headphonesView image in fullscreenShokz OpenSwim Pro£169 at Shokz£169 at John LewisThe OpenSwim Pro are primarily aimed at triathletes, but there are big benefits for trail runners, too. There’s regular Bluetooth connectivity, but the built-in MP3 player also lets you store music so you can soundtrack your trail adventures without draining your phone. Plus, you get all the open-ear benefits of regular bone conduction headphones, so you can tune into nature and your surroundings with the bonus of a guaranteed stay-put fit.The life saversView image in fullscreenPreparing for all weathers is important for your comfort, your trail adventures and your health.Photograph: Robb Reece/Getty ImagesThe sun creamView image in fullscreenRiemann P20 SPF50+£19.99 for 100ml at Boots£13.31 for 100ml at AmazonFor long days on the trails, I slap on P20 SPF50+. I used it to fend off the Saharan sun while running the Marathon des Sables in 2015. It’s completely water- and sweat-resistant, so it doesn’t leak into your eyes and hinder your vision mid-run. And the spray bottle makes application happily mess-free. One liberal coating protects from all the sun’s nasties for 10 hours.The anti-chafe oilView image in fullscreen2Toms SportShield anti-chafing waterproof roll on£17.99 for 45ml at Mountain Warehouse£19.98 for 45ml at AmazonWhatever terrain you’re tackling, being safe from the chafe is important. But the friction risk is raised by running trails with a pack and heavier shoes. There are loads of run-specific anti-chafe solutions, and good old Vaseline does a job. But my go-to is 2Toms Sportshield.This roll-on style oil provides a trusty barrier against unwanted friction burns. It’s easy to apply to all the at-risk areas – nipples, thighs, under arms – and even the hardest to reach nooks and crannies. It’s relatively mess-free, covers easily, and one application lasts all day. The tube is really portable, too, should you need to take it with you.A safety blanket or survival bagView image in fullscreenLifesystemssurvivalbag£5.49 at Decathlon£6 at Ellis BrighamView image in fullscreenEurohike survival blanket£3 at Millets£3 at BlacksThis might seem like overkill, but sticking one of these in your pack could be a literal life saver should you find yourself in an unexpected emergency. If you’re stuck in the middle of nowhere, unable to move, with the cold setting in fast, these packable foil blankets will provide a crucial backup barrier; they’ll return up to 90% of body heat to help fend off hypothermia. Survival bags level up your protection further still, letting you climb inside like a sleeping bag. They’re also another common piece of obligatory race kit.Don’t bother with …Hiking polesA coach once told me that hiking poles were for people with weak legs. I don’t subscribe to that ethos fully, but you unlock the true value of trekking poles only if you use them correctly. That comes with a lot of practice, and the learning curve is as steep as the hills you’re trying to tame. It’s a complication that most beginner trail runners don’t need.Gore-Tex shoesBrands are increasingly offering Gore-Tex-protected editions of their popular trail running shoes that beef up the water resistance. If you’re regularly tackling longer runs in wilder wet conditions, they absolutely have a place, but they come at a premium. For most new trail runners, this level of waterproofing just isn’t necessary. Save your money for later, say when you’ve been lured into running an ultra trail race mid-winter.Kieran Alger is arunning, fitness and health journalist who splits his time between testing, training and tapping out reviewsExplore more on these topicsRunningThe FilterFitnessHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is feared that thousands could have died in that time, leaving grieving families to pick up the bill.One source said: “We should never have scrapped the winter fuel payment in the first place, but the whole process of reinstating it has been completely chaotic. The optics of us demanding the money back from grieving families are dire.”The chancellor has brought forward confirmation of the change to the £11,500 income threshold over which pensioners are no longer eligible for the benefit to next week’s spending review from the autumn budget, after a backlash against one of the most unpopular policies of the Labour government.In a further attempt to win public support and quell Labour backbench concerns, ministers are announcing on Thursday that all pupils in England whose families claim universal credit will be eligible for free school meals under an expansion of the scheme.Hundreds of thousands more children across the country will be able to access means-tested free school meals when the provision is extended from September 2026, after campaigners and school leavers urged ministers to take action on child poverty amidfears of delays.Reeves has already launched a charm offensive to persuade fractious Labour MPs that her spending review will not be a return to austerity, announcing£15bn for trams, trains and busesoutside London aspart of a £113bn investment in capital projectsover the rest of the parliament.The chancellor wants capital spending to be at the centre of the government’s narrative at the review next week in an acknowledgment that MPs, many of them in marginal seats, need a better economic story to address rising discontent among the public.Nearly 2.1 million pupils – almost one in four of the total in England – were eligible for free school meals in January 2024. The Department for Education has said more than half a million more children are expected to benefit from the expansion, with nearly £500 put back into parents’ pockets every year.It suggested that the expansion will lift 100,000 children across England completely out of poverty, with the move being the most effective way of tackling the issue outside the benefits system. Keir Starmer has said the government will look at scrapping the two-child benefits limit.“It is the moral mission of this government to tackle the stain of child poverty, and today this government takes a giant step towards ending it with targeted support that puts money back in parents’ pockets,” the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said.The expansion of free school meals was almost universally welcomed by anti-poverty campaigners and teaching unions. Nick Harrison, chief executive of the Sutton Trust, said: “This is a significant step towards taking hunger out of the classroom.“Children can’t learn effectively when hungry, so this announcement not only helps to tackle the effects of child poverty, but will also likely help improve education outcomes for disadvantaged young people.”Kate Anstey, at the ChildPovertyAction Group charity, said: “This is fantastic news and a gamechanger for children and families. At last, more kids will get the food they need to learn and thrive and millions of parents struggling to make ends meet will get a bit of breathing space.”Asked about the winter fuel payment after a speech in Rochdale, Reeves told reporters: “We have listened to the concerns that people had about the level of the means test, and so we will be making changes to that; they will be in place so that pensioners are paid this coming winter.“We’ll announce the detail of that and the level of that as soon as we possibly can. But people should be in no doubt that the means test will increase and more people will get a winter fuel payment this winter.”The option of paying all pensioners a winter fuel payment and then asking for wealthier people to repay the money is a similar approach to that taken by the former Conservative chancellor George Osborne when he reduced child benefit eligibility for better-off parents.A senior official at HMRC, Jonathan Athow, confirmed to the Treasury select committee on Wednesday that if the tax system was used to make the changes, it would not be possible until next year.“We’d have to get to April next year before we knew somebody’s income, before we could then make any decisions about how [recouping the payment] would then be implemented,” he told MPs.The government’s reversal came despite Downing Street denying that it would make changes to winter fuel payments after theGuardian revealed that it was rethinking the cutamid anxiety at the top of government that the policy could wreak serious electoral damage.The chancellor also hinted at tensions between cabinet colleagues saying she had had to turn down spending requests as she struggled to balance the books.“Not every department will get everything that they want next week,” she said, “and I have had to say no to things that I want to do too.”Just two Whitehall departments are still to agree their multi-year budgets with the Treasury before the spending review, the Guardian understands, with the home secretary, Yvette Cooper and the housing secretary, Angela Rayner, holding out on policing and social housing budgets.She also ruled out bending her fiscal rules, as some Labour MPs have urged her to do, and which she acknowledged would be the subject of much discussion over the coming days. It means that tax rises or further spending cuts are more likely this autumn.Explore more on these topicsFuel povertyEnergy billsHousehold billsPovertyRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

Criminal cases can be stopped at any point if a prosecutor decides there is no longer a realistic prospect of conviction, but this reform strengthens the right of victims to challenge the decision.Though a right to review already exists, it cannot be exercised when the case has been stopped in court. Under the terms of the pilot, for the first time victims of rape or serious sexual abuse will be offered the right to request a review by a different prosecutor before their case is dropped. If that prosecutor determines there is enough evidence, the case will continue.If the trial is successful in the West Midlands, ministers could extend it acrossEnglandand Wales.Jade Blue McCrossen-Nethercott, a justice reform campaigner who won compensation from the CPS after her rape case was dropped amidclaims she could have had an episode of “sexsomnia”, said the pilot was “a hugely important step in the right direction”.“After my own case was closed due to a controversial ‘sexsomnia’ defence, I used the victims’ right to review – only to be told that, despite the CPS admitting a mistake, it was too late to reopen the case because they’d already offered no evidence in court. That experience was devastating,” she said.“I’ve spent nearly three years campaigning behind the scenes for this exact change: for victims to have the opportunity to request a second review before a case is shut down.”She added that, despite its failure in her case, the CPS had shown a willingness to reflect and change and that her “faith in the agencies that once failed me is slowly being restored”.Ministers hope the change will help build trust in the justice system,which has been eroded by lengthy waiting times. In latest quarterly crime data released by the Ministry of Justice running to December 2024, rape and sexual offences had reached a record high in the crown court’s backlog.The number of sexual offences waiting to go to the crown court was 11,981, up by 41% in two years. There were 3,489 adult rape cases waiting to go to trial, an increase of 70% in two years.According to figures published by Rape Crisis, fewer than three in 100 rapes recorded by police in 2024 resulted in someone being charged that same year. Adult rape cases take an average of two years to complete in court, with many taking far longer.The pilot was welcomed by the End Violence Against Women Coalition and Centre for Women’s Justice.Helen Newlove, the victims’ commissioner for England and Wales, said it was “a first step toward ending a manifestly unfair practice that denied victims a voice and robbed them of justice”.Lucy Rigby, the solicitor general, said: “This government is treating violence against women and girls with the seriousness it deserves. Part of that is about empowering victims and improving their experience of the criminal justice system.”Siobhan Blake, CPS lead for rape and chief crown prosecutor of CPS West Midlands, said: “We know for rape victims, the prospect of their case being stopped can be absolutely devastating. Although they can request a review of our decision-making now, if we have already stopped the case in court, there is nothing that can be done to reactivate the case if that review comes to a different conclusion. In those circumstances we offer an apology, but appreciate that for a victim an apology rarely goes far enough or feels like a just outcome.“This pilot offers greater reassurance for victims. It means that they will be alerted to the prospect of their case being stopped earlier, so that they can ask for a review by a different prosecutor. If the original decision is reversed, then the case will continue but even if it can’t we hope that victims will have more confidence in the process and the earlier scrutiny of our decision-making.”Explore more on these topicsRape and sexual assaultViolence against women and girlsCrown Prosecution ServiceUK criminal justiceCrimeWomenEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

We strongly urge all those heading to our locations to follow the routes set by the IDF to ensure safe passage,” it said. It did not give any further details.Gaza Humanitarian Foundation names US evangelical leader as new chairRead moreThe GHF had previously said it had asked the Israeli military to “guide foot traffic in a way that minimises confusion or escalation risks” near military perimeters, develop clearer guidance for civilians and enhance training to support civilian safety. “Our top priority remains ensuring the safety and dignity of civilians receiving aid,” said a GHF spokesperson.An Israeli military spokesperson warned civilians against moving in areas leading to GHF sites on Wednesday, deeming them “combat zones”.The previous day, GHF announced that its distribution points would be closed on Wednesday for “update, organisation and efficiency improvement work”.The killing of the 27 or more Palestinians was the third such shooting in three days, and Israel admitted on Tuesday for the first time that its forces shot at Palestinians. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops fired shots near a food distribution complex after noticing “a number of suspects moving towards them”.“The forces fired evasive shots, and after they did not move away, additional shots were fired near the individual suspects who were advancing towards the forces. The individuals were moving towards forces in a way that posed a threat to them,” the military said, without specifying who the suspects were.MapA spokesperson for the GHF, which has taken over the distribution of food in Gaza and is backed by Israel, told the Associated Press that the group “was saddened to learn that a number of civilians were injured and killed after moving beyond the designated safe corridor”.The shooting occurred at the same site where on Sunday more than30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli firewhile they were heading to the distribution hub.The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, said the “deadly attacks” on civilians around food distribution points was a war crime.“Deadly attacks on distraught civilians trying to access the paltry amounts of food aid in Gaza are unconscionable,” Türk said. “Attacks directed against civilians constitute a grave breach of international law and a war crime.”Witnesses told the Guardian that the shooting started in the city’s Flag Roundabout area, about a kilometre from the food distribution hub.Fadi Abu Mohammad, 43, said his relative Mohammad Abu Shamala, 22, was killed near the food distribution site. “When gunfire opened on the civilians, he was struck by a bullet in the back and died instantly,” Fadi said.2:27What we know about the Gaza food centres – video“He was supposed to get married next month. Going back to the aid distribution is a huge risk and a potential death sentence, but everyone who went had no other choice. If they aren’t killed by bullets or shelling, they will die of hunger.”Israelimposed a blockade on all suppliesin March, claiming Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters. The group denies this and aid officials in Gaza havedenied there is evidenceof any widespread diversion of supplies at any stage of the conflict. In May a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the Strip faced starvation.The GHF took over the handling of food relief despite objections from the UN and other humanitarian organisations, which criticised the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, and that it allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population.On Tuesday, an evangelical leader and adviser to Donald Trump on interfaith issues was appointed as thenew head of the GHF. Johnnie Moore, a member of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom and founder of the boutique advisory firm Kairos Company, replaced Jake Wood, a former marine, who resigned saying hecould not guarantee the GHF’s independencefrom Israeli interests.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over160 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Moore has been a vocal defender of the GHF and has bristled at public criticism of the rollout, telling the UN secretary general, António Guterres, on X that reports of Palestinians killed and injured while seeking food supplies in Gaza were “a lie … spread by terrorists”.The UN security council is expected to vote on Wednesday on a demand for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and humanitarian access across Gaza, where malnutrition is widespread and food relief has only trickled in since Israel lifted an 11-week blockade in late May.“It is unacceptable. Civilians are risking – and in several instances losing – their lives just trying to get food,” a UN spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said on Tuesday, adding that the food distribution model backed by the US and Israel was “a recipe for disaster, which is exactly what is going on”.At least 48 people were killed by Israeli bombardment across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, including 14 in a single strike on a tent sheltering displaced people, the civil defence agency said.Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Women were also 39% less likely to have a procedure to replace their aortic valve.Aortic stenosis is a condition where the aortic valve, which controls blood moving from the heart to the body, starts restricting blood flow. This causes it to become narrow, resulting in symptoms such as shortness of breath and chest pain.The study also found that black patients were 48% less likely to undergo a procedure to replace their aortic valve than white patients, with south Asian patients being 27% less likely. Both groups were more likely to be referred to secondary care, although the researchers say that this could reflect referrals for other heart issues not related to their aortic stenosis.Dr Anvesha Singh, an associate professor at the University of Leicester and a consultant cardiologist, who was involved in the research, said: “Previous studies have shown lower rates of valve replacement in women, and clinicians had assumed that women were less likely to be diagnosed with aortic stenosis. This analysis using large, real-world data clearly shows that this is not the case, giving us the clearest picture yet of what is happening in day-to-day clinical practice.“Our study highlights potential inequities in management and care of this common and serious condition. More research is needed to understand the reasons for this and the true prevalence of aortic stenosis in different groups.”Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, the clinical director at the British Heart Foundation – which supported the research – and a consultant cardiologist, said: “This study of over 150,000 GP records has unveiled disparities in access to aortic valve treatment for women, south Asian and black people, and people living in more deprived communities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To be clear, no financial loss to those individuals.”He added: “This was organised crime phishing for identity data outwith of HMRC systems, so stuff that banks and others will also unfortunately experience, and then trying to use that data to create PAYE accounts to pay themselves a repayment and/or access an existing account.”An investigation into the matter, which took place last year “including jurisdictions outside the UK”, led to “some arrests last year”, Marks told MPs.Angela MacDonald, HMRC’s deputy chief executive and second permanent secretary, added: “At the moment, they’ve managed to extract repayments to the tune of £47m. Now that is a lot of money, and it’s very unacceptable.Watchdog accuses HMRC of deliberately ‘degrading’ phone servicesRead more“We have overall, in the last tax year, we actually protected £1.9bn worth of money which sought to be taken from us by attacks.”MacDonald stressed the breach was “not a cyber-attack, we have not been hacked, we have not had data extracted from us”.She later added: “The ability for somebody to breach your systems and to extract data, to hold you to ransomware and all of those things, that is a cyber-attack. That is not what has happened here.”HMRC said it had locked down affected accounts and deleted login details to prevent future unauthorised access.Any incorrect information has been removed from tax records and officials have checked to ensure no other details have been changed.People affected will receive a letter from HMRC over the next three weeks.Marks also told MPs that HMRC phone lines were down on Wednesday afternoon but said this was “coincidental”, adding they will be “back up and available” on Thursday.An HMRC spokesperson said: “We’ve acted to protect customers after identifying attempts to access a very small minority of tax accounts, and we’re working with other law enforcement agencies both in the UK and overseas to bring those responsible to justice.“This was not a cyber-attack – it involved criminals using personal information from phishing activity or data obtained elsewhere to try to claim money from HMRC.“We’re writing to those customers affected to reassure them we’ve secured their accounts and that they haven’t lost any money.”Last week, UK banks and payment firms were urged tostrengthen their anti-fraud systemsfor international payments after a rise in scammers tricking people into sending money abroad.New figures revealed that international payments accounted for 11% of authorised push payment scams losses in 2024 – almost double the 2023 figure.Explore more on these topicsHMRCCybercrimeScamsConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

This is just the beginningElton JohnSpeaking at an awards event after the vote, Elton John said copyright protection was an “existential issue” for artists and urged the government “to do the right thing”.He added: “We will not let the government forget their promise to support our creative industries. We will not back down and we will not quietly go away. This is just the beginning.”Wednesday night’s vote prolongs a lengthy standoff between the Commons and Lords over the data bill, which has been used as a vehicle by campaigners to oppose the government’s proposed copyright reforms.Resistance to the changes in the Lords has been led byBeeban Kidron, a cross-bench peer and film director, whose amendments have been repeatedly backed by the upper chamber.The data bill now faces the prospect of being shelved unless the Commons accepts the Kidron amendment or proposes an alternative.Maggie Jones, the Lords minister for the digital economy and online safety, had urged peers to vote against the Kidron amendment after the government offered last-minute concessions in an attempt to stave off another defeat.Before the vote, Jones said peers were “choosing whether they want the entire bill to fall” and that by voting for Kidron’s amendment they would “countenance the unprecedented – to try to collapse a bill that does nothing to weaken copyright law” but included other important measures including to combat sexually explicit deepfake images.Kidron told peers: “This is our last chance to ask the government to provide a meaningful solution” and urged ministers to set out concrete steps to subject AI companies to copyright rules.“It is not fair, not reasonable, not just, balanced or any other such word to stand in the way of the creative industries identifying those who are taking their work or their property. It is not neutral – it is aiding and abetting what we have called in the house widespread theft.“We have asked privately and repeatedly on the floor of both houses what is the government going to do to stop the work of creatives from being stolen right now? The answer is nothing.”Several peers pushed back against the suggestion that the Lords’ move was unprecedented and said the government was itself breaking precedent by not compromising. Tim Clement-Jones, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for the digital economy, offered his party’s “staunch support” for Kidron’s amendment.View image in fullscreenBeeban Kidron said a question had to be asked – why did the government feel unable to protect UK interests and want to give away the country’s riches and jobs?Photograph: Carl Court/GettyThe Lords’ move puts the data bill in double insistence territory. This means the Commons and Lords cannot reach agreement over legislation. In this scenario, under parliamentary convention, the bill would fall unless ministers accept the rebel amendment or offer an alternative. A bill falling is extremely rare but not without precedent – it happened to the European parliamentary elections bill in the 1997-98 session.Under parliamentary convention, the Commons has primacy as the elected house, and in rare instances where the Lords refuses to back down ministers can resort to the Parliament Act to pass the bill in the next parliamentary session. This would significantly delay the legislation.In concessions offered to peers on Tuesday night, the government said it would commit to publishing further technical reports on the future of AI and copyright regulation and do so within nine months instead of 12.“A number of noble Lords have voiced concerns during ping-pong that the government is not listening. This is simply not the case,” Jones said in her letter, reiterating that ministers regretted the way the Lords rebels had gone about the changes.Jones stressed that the data bill was expected to generate £10bn of economic benefit by updating data protection law and that it would improve online safety, including by strengthening powers to ask social media companies to preserve data after the death of a child.Kidron said: “It is in the gift of the government to accept the amendment, or put something meaningful in its place. They have failed to listen to the Lords, they have failed to listen to the creative sector, they have failed to listen to their own backbenchers.”Under the government’s proposals, AI companies would be allowed to train their models using copyrighted work without permission unless the owner opts out. The plans have beenfiercely criticised by creators and publishersincluding high-profile artists such as Paul McCartney and Tom Stoppard.Peter Kyle, the technology secretary, has said heregretted the decisionto launch a consultation on changing copyright law with the opt-out system as the “preferred option”. Campaigners against the changes believe that there is resistance inside Downing Street to making more substantial concessions.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Intellectual propertyHouse of LordsHouse of CommonsBeeban KidronLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Radiologists and clinical oncologists face “unsustainable” workloads, it adds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These delays may lead to the cancer spreading, making it harder to treat successfully.”The Department ofHealthand Social Care acknowledged that too many patients face delays.“This government inherited a broken NHS where too many cancer patients are waiting too long for treatment but through our plan for change, we are determined to tackle delays, diagnose cancer earlier and treat it faster,” a spokesperson said.“We are delivering 40,000 more appointments every week, investing £1.5bn in both new surgical hubs and AI scanners, rolling out cutting-edge radiotherapy machines to every region in the country, and backing our radiologists and oncologists with above inflation pay rises for the second year in a row.“Later this year we will also publish a refreshed workforce plan to ensure the NHS has the right people in the right places to deliver the care patients need.”Explore more on these topicsCancerNHSHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

You know, the grade, the colour spectrum – it’s a completely different experience. Audiences want things which are real and authentic and connect them with the history of the media.“The Filmhouse is a venue that is able to offer that experience in a way that few other venues can.”The cinema, which will have four screens, is reopening after a major community-led campaign to save it, launched by senior staff and board members when itclosed suddenlyin October 2022 after a financial crisis.Simpson, hired from the Tyneside cinema in Newcastle, said the venue would again become a hub for independent film festivals, and make great use of its collection of heritage film projectors.The Filmhouse’s original set of 70mm, 35mm, 16mm and 8mm projectors, as well as television broadcast-grade equipment that used large, so-called “exhibition tapes” known as Beta SPs, allow it to screen a huge range of current and historic films.The venue also has modern digital projectors, but the collection of heritage machines was quite rare in the UK, Simpson said. “We’re here to celebrate full diversity of film, to celebrate the full history of cinema, and actually being able to display films on those formats is a really vital an important part of that mission.”He said the use of those traditional formats “really connects with audiences”. The Glasgow Film Theatre had a bigger box office when it screened The Brutalist, starring Adrien Brody, in 70mm than it had during its original opening weekend three weeks earlier.The “open the doors” campaign to save the Filmhouse, backed by stars and patrons such as Brian Cox, Dougray Scott, Charlotte Wells and Jack Lowden, raised £324,000, and won £1.5m in UK government funding and backing from the agencies ScreenScotlandand Creative Scotland.The refurbished cinemas, complete with new seating and a reopened bar and restaurant, are being leased for 25 years from the building’s current owners, the pub and restaurant chain Caledonian Heritable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Filmhouse is expected to again become a festival venue.Simpson said the “extraordinary” success in reopening the Filmhouse should embolden and encourage community campaigners elsewhere. “It can offer some real sort of hope for how local communities can fight to hold to the things that are really kind of important to them,” he said.Explore more on these topicsScotlandEdinburghEdinburgh film festivalFestivalsShareReuse this content"

I’m not making bombs any more – I’m making coffee.”Patek was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2012 for his role in theBalibombings, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and 23 Britons.In what remains Indonesia’s deadliest terror attack, Patek helped mix 50kg of the 1 tonne of explosives used in the bombs, while prosecutors said he helped assemble suicide vests, detonator cords and boosters.But Patek says those days are long behind him.View image in fullscreenUmar Patek, with his own coffee blend, Ramu, on 3 June 2025.Photograph: Michael NeilsonReleased from jail in late 2022, he has started to rebuild his life by marketing a spiced coffee blend based on his mother’s recipe, an initiative he says is part of his mission to help deradicalise terrorists.“Ramu, if reversed, becomes Umar, my name,” he said, “Ramu in Indonesian means to mix. Like myself, who is currently mixing coffee.”After his release Patek said he struggled to reintegrate into society until in 2023 he met David Andreasmita, a dentist and businessman who owns the Hedon Estate cafe in Surabaya, who decided to offer him a second chance.“Many people thought it was strange that I wanted to work with a former terrorist,” Andreasmita said. “I have always liked helping people. [But I knew] if I let Umar be, then it would be very possible he would become a terrorist again.”“I am Christian and he is Muslim, but we can joke together. Umar even considers me his mentor,” he said, “This coffee business is a form of deradicalisation.”But for survivors and families of the victims, redemption remains difficult to accept.At Tuesday’s launch, Husnul Khotimah, an Indonesian survivor, confronted Patek about his former life.View image in fullscreenHusnul Khotimah, an Indonesian survivor of the 2002 Bali bombings.Photograph: Michael Neilson“Do you still remember me?” she asked him.“Look at this,” she continued, gesturing to the scars on her arms and hands – a fraction of the burn scars that still cover 70% of her body.Patek stood and listened, and appeared moved by Khotimah’s words. He said he did remember her, from his sentencing in 2012 at which she had also confronted him, and apologised again.“I’m sorry that my apology is not comparable to the suffering you feel. If my business is successful, David and I are committed to inviting you and other victims to work with us.”Khotimah, from nearby Sidoarjo, underwent 37 surgeries in Indonesia and Australia and still has metal fragments lodged in her legs from the attacks.“It is very difficult for me to forgive Umar and his friends,” she said, “Especially with my suffering and struggles in the past.”In 2022, Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese said he had “contempt” for Patek’s actions and that his early release would renew trauma for victims’ families.Patek said he has apologised many times in the past.“Today, I apologise again. Let me prove that I have changed,” he said, “Everyone is watching me now.”After fleeing Bali before the attacks, Patek spent nine years on the run in Pakistan and the Philippines, where he was affiliated with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. He was arrested in 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan – the same town where Osama bin Laden was later killed.He was also convicted for his involvement in the 2000 Christmas Eve church bombings in Indonesia that killed 18 people.Tuesday’s event drew local and national politicians, and the former head of Indonesia’s counter-terrorism agency, Marthinus Hukom, who helped arrest Patek. Some attendees welcomed his efforts to turn his life around.Security analyst Noor Huda Ismail, founder of The Institute for International Peace Building, said his team had worked with Patek post-release and that his case showed good potential for rehabilitation.“His willingness to disengage from violent ideology and embrace a peaceful identity has been crucial,” Ismail said. “Equally critical is the ecosystem of support – people who are willing to look beyond his past and invest in his future.”Patek had disengaged from radical networks and been supported by family and the Indonesian government’s reintegration program, which includes counselling, religious re-education, and economic support, he said.“Extending a second chance to someone like Umar Patek is not about forgetting the past,” he said, “It’s about reducing the risk of future violence and building a safer society.”For his part, Patek said he understood that some may never forgive him.“The public can see and judge for themselves,” he said, “Starting now.”This article was amended on 4 June 2025. An earlier version misidentified the premises referred to in the third paragraph as the Andreasmita cafe, rather than the Hedon Estate cafe.Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaBaliAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The fortune teller recommended that they try to be more open with each other.But the advice on the future of the relationship didn’t come from a human – it came from ChatGPT.InThailand, a country with a rich tradition of fortune telling, Whan, 28, is among a growing number of young people turning toChatGPTfor answers about their future. On social media, users share advice on how to upload pictures of their palms for palm readings, and of their birth charts, which show the positions of the planets at the time of their birth.Usually, if Whan wants to see her fortune teller, she needs to book an appointment months in advance - and pay 599 baht [£13.55] for a one hour session. So, when she saw comments on social media praising the accuracy of ChatGPT’s readings, she decided to give it a try. She typed into the chat box: “I saw many people have asked you about their fortune based on a birth chart. Can you do it for me?”It replied: “My pleasure”, before asking the time, date and location of her birth.Satisfied with her first reading, Whan, who asked to use only her nickname, later uploaded a picture of her face for a face reading, and asked ChatGPT to analyse her compatibility with her boyfriend.View image in fullscreenFortune-tellers show astrology wallpapers on their phones as they livestream a card reading session on an online platform in Bangkok, Thailand 8 April, 2022.Photograph: Chalinee Thirasupa/ReutersThe importance of fortune tellers - called “Mor Doo,” meaning “doctors who see” - dates back centuries inThailand, a majority Buddhist country, where culture is shaped by astrology and other forms of divination.Fortune tellers are consulted by anyone from politicians or wealthy business people weighing up investment decisions, to students nervous about their exam results or curious about their love life.‘They make things look cute’: how the TikTok generation is reshaping Thailand’s spiritual lifeRead moreEstimates of the size of the market for spiritual goods and services vary, though last year the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce suggested it was worth between $304 and $456m.Research produced in January by Krungsri Bankfound that younger people were most likely of all generations to buy such products online, and that of the growing range of spiritual services offered through digital technologies, fortune telling applications drew the most interest from all ages.Jirapat Wangcharoen, 27, a content creator focused on astrology and spirituality, has benefited from the rising trend. On his TikTok account Nesh the Wizard, he has shared advice using ChatGPT, with one video last October liked by tens of thousands of users.Jirapat researched the use ofAIas a personal navigation tool while studying his Master’s degree in Australia. “My key takeaway was people just want to take their anxieties away as soon as possible,” he said. “If they have a question at night, at 1am, they don’t want to linger on that… They go to ChatGPT or TikTok live to ask the question.”“It’s easier for them [young people] to talk to robots rather than humans,” he added.While fortune tellers can easily be found on social media, or sitting at tables outside temples, people often prefer to use someone they trust and have consulted previously, or who has been recommended. This can mean they need to wait for an appointment.Ruchi Agarwal, assistant professor of anthropology at Mahidol University, said curiosity about the future peaks in times of instability. “If you look at the past trends, whenever there was economic crisis or political crisis, then there was always a search for either spirit mediums or fortune tellers – just as a psychological remedy, or for finding some solution to the uncertainty they face,” she said.This is also the case for younger people today, who have lived through political instability and the pandemic, and who are also, she said, “more in their silos, and more attached to social media”.‘Don’t ask what AI can do for us, ask what it is doing to us’: are ChatGPT and co harming human intelligence?Read moreAjarn Par, or Master Par, an astrologist based in Huai Khwang, an area of Bangkok known for its popular Ganesha Shrine and fortune tellers, agreed that younger people are searching for meaning. “It’s [a way of building] emotional resilience in an uncertain world,” she said. “Young people have a feeling of [a lack] of control.”Some have raised concerns about the risk of giving AI tools with personal information such as photos or birth details. And, opinions are divided over whether ChatGPT or other AI tools will have long-lasting appeal among those interested in astrology.View image in fullscreenAjarn Par, or Master Par, Thai astrologer based in Huai Khwang, an area of Bangkok that is known for its popular Ganesha Shrine and fortune tellers.Photograph: Rebecca Ratcliffe/The GuardianAjarn Par believes ChatGPT may be capable of relaying data about astrological principles, but she questions its benefits.“To give proper guidance, you need to have lived experience… [human fortune tellers] have the feeling of human intuition,” she said.She likens fortune tellers’ role to that of a therapist, someone people can consult in their most difficult moments. None of this can be replicated by a computer, she said. “A robot cannot touch your feelings.”For Whan, there are positives to consulting both humans and ChatGPT. With a human teller, she said, you can see their face and reactions.But with AI: “you can just use it right away - and you can keep asking them.”Explore more on these topicsThailandAsia PacificArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

But after agreeing to exclusive takeover talks with the US private equity company KKR, the debt-laden utility was hoping for a quieter period as it sorted out the details.Those hopes were extinguished on Tuesday after KKR said it waswithdrawing its bid– to the shock of Thames Water and its creditors.It is those creditors, some of whom bought Thames’s debt at a big discount in the hope of a quick profit, who have been left – without warning – with the responsibility of pulling together billions of pounds to carry out a turnaround that could take 15 years.Thames Water hit with £123m of fines over sewage and dividend breachesRead moreThames Water has been through a tumultuous year already. It had a close shave with bankruptcy, ahigh court battle to secure £3bnin emergency investment, and several testy parliamentary hearings. It must invest £20bn over the next five years to fix leaking pipes and water treatment works, all while trying to fend off public anger over sewage in Britain’s rivers and seas.KKR balked at the complexity of taking on Thames amid so much scrutiny and with multiple stakeholders in play, according to a person close to the talks. Partners at the private equity firm had carried out 10 weeks of intensive due diligence, including several visits to wastewater treatment works, and had relied on a small army of up to 200 advisers to carry out detailed assessments. The state of some of the Thames assets was worse than KKR had initially thought, according to another source.New York-based KKR, short for Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, had deployed 15 members of its European infrastructure team, run by the executive Tara Davies, to work on the bid, with James Gordon serving as the lead partner. (Both formerly worked for Macquarie, the Australian investment bank criticised fortaking dividends from Thames while building up debt– although they are not thought to have worked on the water company.) Yet over the weekend KKR brought out one of its big guns to try to sweet talk the government: Henry Kravis, one of the co-founders, called up Labour’s business adviser Varun Chandra to discuss the plan. Sky News first reported the call.KKR has rarely been shy ofpotential controversy, ever since its infamous 1988 buyout of the US conglomerate RJR Nabisco was depicted in the book Barbarians at the Gate. However, several people close to the Thames Water situation have said they believed KKR also became concerned about the political risks associated with it, such as the possibility of intense public scrutiny leading to a stricter approach from the government on enforcement.A government spokesperson said: “The government makes no apology for tackling the poor behaviour we have seen in the past, where too many people were rewarded for failure,” but added: “We welcome investors who want to work with us to rebuild this vital sector and clean up our rivers, lakes and seas.”Ofwat, the water regulator for England and Wales, last week laid down the gauntlet to KKR with£123m in new penaltiesmostly related to environmental breaches involving sewage spills.KKR’s bid hinged on convincing regulators including Ofwat and the Environment Agency to grant it leniency on fines, penalties and other costs amounting to billions of pounds,as revealed by the Guardian.“There were always going to be three people in the marriage,” wrote Helen Rodriguez, the head of European special situations at CreditSights, a bond rating agency: Thames Water, KKR and Ofwat. KKR may have been put off by “the inevitable drip of more fines to come”, and decided it was not worth going through a month of meetings in June to try to reach a compromise, she added.Thames Water has hired its own army of advisers, including the law firm Linklaters. It is understood the Linklaters lawyers involved have included Alison Saunders, formerly the UK’s director of public prosecutions, and Jonathan Jones, a former head of the government’s legal department. Saunders has previously acted for Southern Water on a criminal investigation, while Jones acted for the energy company Bulb during its special administration. Linklaters declined to comment.Keir Starmer’s office received a courtesy call from KKR before the announcement. The government is hoping to avoid involvement.The environment secretary, Steve Reed, told parliament on Tuesday there remained “a market-led solution on the table” as he categorically ruled out a permanent nationalisation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is an unwieldy group of 100 companies, holding £13bn in Thames Water bonds. The investment bank Jefferies is acting as the group’s main financial adviser.Despite the financial pressure Thames is under – and the cash burn required to fund its operations – the water company has covered the costs of as much as £15m for due diligence checks that KKR spent on exploring the state of the vast business. Much of that information has already been shared with the creditor group, and will now be used to inform their talks with Ofwat.However, the creditors must race to secure a deal as Thames burns through the first £1.5bn of the emergency cash it borrowed to fund its day-to-day operations.Like KKRbefore it, the creditor group will also try to reach an accommodation with Ofwat that will reduce the scope for big fines that would threaten to wipe out their financial returns. The new owners would look to install a board with more water industry experience. The position of Thames Water’s chief executive, Chris Weston, is unclear.“The creditors believe that Thames Water requires an urgent and fundamental reset and there is a very short and closing window in which a market-led solution can succeed,” a spokesperson for the lenders said. “Discussions with Ofwat and the government will be advanced in the coming weeks to reach an agreement and turnaround for the benefit of customers and the environment.”Even if yet another deal on Thames Water can be reached, people involved in the crisis noted the irony of the timing of KKR’s decision: it was announced just as an interim government review highlighted“deep-rooted, systemic” problemsin England and Wales’s privatised water industry.Explore more on these topicsThames WaterUtilitiesWater industryanalysisShareReuse this content"

A star-crossed romance about London-dwelling young adults Raj and Simran, the three-hour epic explored the lives of a new generation of diaspora Indians born abroad and navigating changing family values.Thirty years on and DDLJ has become one of the highest grossing Bollywood movies of all time, still screening at the Maratha Mandir cinema in Mumbai. For the many fans used to singing along to its songs on wedding dancefloors, director Aditya Chopra’s stage adaptation will come as a surprise.With new music from Bollywood production duo Vishal-Shekhar and an updated story by Mean Girls co-writer Nell Benjamin, Come Fall in Love supplants Punjabi boy Raj with all-English “Rog” (Roger) to produce a multiracial take on the diaspora tale.View image in fullscreenStar-crossed romance … Rog (Ashley Day) and Simran (Jen Pandya) in Come Fall in Love.Photograph: Johan PerssonThe racial dynamics and narrative beats are broad-brushstroke. Billionaire progeny Roger (Ashley Day) is the son of divorced parents and doesn’t believe in lasting love, while straight-A student Simran (Jena Pandya) is a second-generation immigrant striving for an immaculate romance while promised to a family friend in Punjab. The pair are an unlikely couple, until they find themselves Interrailing around Europe and sparks fly.So far, so predictable. Yet, Day and Pandya have an undeniable chemistry, flitting around one another with nimble coyness and furtive passion, leaving the audience rooting for their inevitable love. Rob Ashford and Shruti Merchant’s choreography is equally engrossing, making full use of the ensemble cast to dart around and leap over Derek McLane’s intricate set, while standout solo performances come from Kinshuk Sen as clowning fiancee Kuljit and Kara Lane as Rog’s mother, Minky, in the raucous number Hot and Independent and Hot.Vishal-Shekhar’s bhangra, reggae and disco music may not reach the melodramatic peaks of the original film’s yearning melodies but closing number Holi Hai is infectiously celebratory, leaving the audience on their feet. It is testament to the fact that while Come Fall in Love isn’t the most nuanced or complex investigation of diaspora identity, it is joyously loud and kitsch, expertly embodying the tenets of the Bollywood art form.AtManchester Opera Houseuntil 21 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsBollywoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

Another critic pulled me aside just in time. But then again, she pressed the button to release the airborne poo – fake, I think – in the first place. This is Kara Chin’s funny installation in a cinema recreating the seediness of the seaside with squawking AI seagulls on video screens, chaotic electro-assemblages resembling mutant arcade machines and a floor covered with guano. Liverpool is not by the sea but close enough that seagulls provide a chorus as you walk between Liverpool Biennial art events in museums, galleries, warehouses and community centres.I can’t see the Liver Birds on the skyline without remembering the first time I visited this city as small child, seeing my aunt off on a voyage across the Atlantic, from docks that then loomed with massive ships. Proustian memories of the biggest city I knew as a child return with a vengeance in a raw warehouse space where Turkish artist Cevdet Erek has created a homage to the noise and intensity of soccer crowds. He loves football and loud music. I meet him there and he enthuses about attending Anfield as research, and being inspired by a track on Pink Floyd’s Meddle. Flashbacks of matches with my dad surge.But Erek’s installion is not a literal portrayal of a football game. Instead it transfigures the noise and tension of a big match. The space is dominated by an arena made of brown, earthy bricks while a pounding soundtrack pumps from speakers in its seating areas. It’s eerie and seems ancient, for the pebbly arena and stands make you think as much of gladiatorial games as modern soccer. Vicious drums increase the menace. But there are no people. It’s a ruin excavated in the desert, to which a Floyd of the future have come to perform to the empty air.View image in fullscreenPeople being raised up by angels into the heavens … Maria Loizidou’s crocheted tapestry in Liverpool Cathedral.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe 2025 Liverpool Biennial is entitled Bedrock and its best moments come when artists engage with the emotional bedrock of Liverpool itself – from football to religion. Is there a difference? At Bluecoat contemporary arts centre, Amy Claire Mills shows a bright, booming mural of Liverpool’s coat of arms, reproducing its surreal mythology in which the sea god Neptune, a merman, dolphins and, of course, the Liver Birds all feature.Yet by and large the freshest experiences are to be had in site-specific works outside galleries and museums. The WalkerArtGallery’s Biennial show of unmemorable art is eclipsed by the likes of Hogarth and Millais in its collection. Nour Bishouty has placed a wooden sculpture of a gazelle-like animal, inlaid with mother of pearl, on a plinth below a painting of an outsized ox by Liverpool-born 18th-century artist George Stubbs. Past beats present here.But enter Liverpool’s Anglican cathedral, with its stupendous interior by Giles Gilbert Scott, and you see a veil of colour suspended against its brown craggy heights, a woven work by Cypriot artist Maria Loizidou that depicts people being raised up by angels into the heavens. Its imagery of redemption is positively medieval. Taking religion seriously turns out to be the freshest, most surprisingly successful aspect of this art festival in a multi-faith city.On the Liverpool skyline you can sometimes see both Scott’s neo-medieval pile and the more graceful modernist Catholic cathedral. In the best artwork of the Biennial, Turner prize winner Elizabeth Price explores a question that might not occur to many people but she makes fascinating: how did Britain’s Catholic communities come to build so many modernist churches?View image in fullscreenBright and booming … Deep End by Amy Claire Mills.Photograph: Mark McNultyHer film, in a darkened hall in Liverpool’s Chinatown, uses a suspenseful soundtrack, digital graphics and sinister negative images to ponder this. As Irish Catholic immigration to Britain increased in the 20th century, the growing community had to remedy a lack of Catholic churches. A new one was built around a century ago on Anglesey, the first stop for many Irish immigrants arriving by sea. Price tries to understand why it took a radical modernist form, an upturned ship’s hull moulded in concrete by an Italian architect. She relates it to military architecture, including airship hangars, and the music becomes more threatening. Yet she doesn’t seem satisfied with her own answers – and as a drum throbs, the colours and negative saturation get ever more lurid. For a moment I expected a horror ending, a murder in the cathedral.Instead she takes you inside some of the churches to see their mysticism enhanced by her effects, and it dawns on you. The supernatural force haunting these spaces is – can it be … God?I’d always thought of Price as a gothic artist. But just as William Peter Blatty, author of The Exorcist, was trying to promote the Catholic faith, so in this compelling artwork Price appears to reveal that she is, and always has been, a religious artist.Outside this city roars, profane and riotous, but under the skin it has a soul. The Liverpool Biennial has a lot of forgettable art in it. But at its best it cuts not just to the architectural but the spiritual heart of Liverpool. Huge as that heart is.TheLiverpool Biennialopens 7 JuneExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingInstallationSculptureLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s what worked‘I’m tired of peeing in my pants,’ I said to the urogynecologist. ‘Please fix me’Buy an exclusive print from our Well Actually seriesAmanda KlarsfeldWed 4 Jun 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 13.31 EDTShareLast October, I got out of bed to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. Sleepy and seated on the toilet, I was shocked into wakefulness by a loud sound.The night before, in my latest attempt to manage incontinence, I’d been working out how to use aKegelball, a marble-like vaginal insert that claims to help with pelvic floor strengthening. I’d accidentally fallen asleep with it inside me, and the ball had hit the porcelain bowl.Uh-oh.I dismounted and stuck my ungloved hand deep into the toilet. Luckily, I was able to retrieve it before it entered the drain pipe, preventing the need for a mortifying 3am call to my super. This was both my first and last time using the Kegel ball.Eighteen years prior, I had experienced bladder leakage after giving birth, but it resolved within a year. Once perimenopause hit at age 47, however, the condition returned and managing it had become my part-time job.At the advice of my gynecologist, I’d tried daily self-directed Kegel exercises, tampon-like devices designed to prevent leaks by lifting the urethra, and bladder training – or gradually increasing the time between bathroom visits, which I lost interest in pretty quickly. None of these options really worked.So my bladder kept leaking, usually after laughing, coughing or sneezing. Panty liners were now an essential part of my wardrobe. The worst leaks occurred when I went on a run, and required more substantial protection. I wondered how many other middle-aged women on my Central Park loop had diaper-like devices hidden under their Lululemon leggings.Perimenopause has brought chaos to my life – but also peaceRead moreProbably a lot. More than 60% of US women surveyed from 2015 to 2018reported bladder control challenges. Incontinence often begins after childbirth, due to a combination of estrogen loss and physical trauma, says Dr Meghan Markowski, a board-certified clinical specialist in women’s health physical therapy at Brigham and Women’s hospital. “Because we have a certain reserve of estrogen, things get better. Then, when we start to lose estrogen in peri- and post-menopause, these symptoms come back with full-fledged vengeance,” she says.I was an empty nester and recent divorcee and dating again for the first time in decades when incontinence re-reared its ugly head again. On dates, I’d often scurry away in order to beat the leak. I wondered what these men thought of all those visits to the bathroom – perhaps they suspected I was sneaking drugs or plotting my escape.Although males are also likely to lose some bladder control with age, middle-aged mendo not experiencethe same surge in incontinence that women do. The men I met were mostly my age and their kids had probably been potty trained a decade ago, or more. Did they really want a partner who was going through the reverse?Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, 'Well Actually', then 'Read more on living a good life in a complex world,' then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say 'More from this section'If you can’t beat it, talk about it, I decided. And as I started to share, I noticed two things. First, men are usually OK with discussing your vaginal region, no matter the reason. And second, when I revealed my problem to female friends, I learned that I was in good company.“There’s no reason why this should be taboo,” saidDr Larissa Rodríguez, urologist-in-chief and director of theCenter for Female Pelvic Healthat NewYork-Presbyterian hospital and Weill Cornell Medicine. “For anything that affects women’s quality of life, they should seek care because there are ways to treat it.”What causes incontinence in womenThere are two main types of incontinence: stress and urge. Both occur because of a decline in estrogen, which weakens the pelvic floor and thins the lining of the urethra.Stress incontinence is caused by physical pressure – such as coughing or running – putting stress on the bladder, leading to urine leakage. This is common when the pelvic muscles, which support the urethra, are weak. This is the type I had: unpleasant and inconvenient, but manageable with pads.Urge incontinence occurs when the bladder contracts more than it should, and can be much harder to live with. “It’s characterized by the sudden compelling desire to pass urine that is either difficult or impossible to defer,” said Markowski. “You could be out shopping, everything’s great, and you go to check out and all of a sudden …Clear the path! I have to get there immediately!”How to treat incontinence“For stress incontinence, the gold standard is sling surgery,” said Rodríguez. The sling is “material put under the urethra, like a hammock, so the urethra has something to close against when there’s an increase in abdominal pressure”. Traditionally, mesh is used but it’s also possible for doctors to harvest tissue from the patient, like the lining of the abdomen or the fascia of the thigh muscle.Alternatively, stress incontinence can be relieved by injecting bulking agents to increase resistance and thickness in the urethral wall. “These are similar to the fillers people use for wrinkles,” said Rodríguez. “They are mostly water-based and close the urethra up a bit.” This is a good option for those who want to avoid surgery. It’s a shorter-term fix, but can last several years.Urge incontinence can be improved with two types of medication, both of which reduce bladder contractions. The first type, anticholinergics, accomplish this by blocking the chemical messenger acetylcholine, while the second type, beta-3 agonists, relax the bladder’s detrusor muscle, thereby increasing bladder capacity.If medication fails, Rodríguez said nerve modulation – changing nerve activity via stimulation – is the next step. Inserting a pacemaker near the sacral nerves, which manage the bladder, can result in improved brain-to-bladder communication and control. Acupuncture can stimulate nerves at the ankle, blocking abnormal signals from the bladder and preventing spasms. Another option is injecting botulinum toxin, the same one peopleuse for cosmetic purposes. It relaxes the bladder muscles so you don’t have spasms.Stress and urge incontinence are both caused by midlife estrogen decline, so ongoing vaginal estrogen supplementation may help, like what’s prescribed for vaginal dryness at menopause, according to Dr Rajita Patil, assistant clinical professor of OB-GYN at UCLA and director of UCLA Health’s comprehensive menopause care program. “It takes a few months to see a difference, and the risks are really low,” said Patil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Physicians on five common pelvic floor mythsRead moreAnother highly effective and clinically proven way to prevent and treat incontinence is pelvic physical therapy, which, according to Markowski, is not as simple as doing Kegel exercises. “Without individually assessing someone’s pelvic floor, you have no idea what they’re actually doing. Are the muscles so weak you can’t activate them? Or are they so tense you can’t activate them? The starting function of the pelvic floor muscles will determine the plan of care,” Markowski said. But a training program takes time; Markowski recommends at least three months. If this seems daunting, she suggests at least one pelvic physical therapy session to be properly evaluated and advised.No matter which treatment you choose, behavior modification is also essential. “Alcohol, caffeine, carbonated beverages and artificial sweeteners irritate the bladder,” said Patil, who also encourages adequate hydration and maintaining a “healthy” body weight. “The more fat there is on the bladder and the urethral sphincter, the greater the pressure exerted on these structures, weakening their ability to maintain closure and increasing the likelihood of urinary leakage.”Another behavioral strategy is bladder retraining – gradually increasing the time intervals between bathroom visits, improving your ability to hold urine – which my gynecologist had recommended.How sling surgery fixed my incontinenceA friend mentioned someone who had undergone a sling surgery, which I’d never heard of. It seemed like a great option, and I could hardly contain my excitement. A week after turning 50, I made an appointment with a urogynecologist.Prolapse, tearing, pain: a urogynecologist on what you should know before giving birthRead more“I’m tired of peeing in my pants,” were my exact words. “Please fix me.”A bladder test determined that I had stress incontinence. I scheduled the surgery, an outpatient procedure covered by insurance. Recovery was virtually painless; I didn’t even take any Tylenol. I stayed home for a few days, and was told not to exercise or “stick anything in the vagina” for four weeks. The hardest part was not being able to work out, but the anticipation of pad-less runs made it worth the wait.Now, two months post-surgery, my runs are pee-free. Last week, I visited my surgeon to reperform the bladder test. She made my bladder uncomfortably full via a catheter, then asked me to make a small cough. Then a medium cough. Then a loud one. My underpants remained as dry as a bone.According to my surgeon, I should be “fixed” for at least the next 10 years. And physical therapy, though not mandatory, could make the results last longer.Still, there is no such thing as a perfect solution, and treatments may work best when combined with others. Markowski, who’s dedicated more than 20 years to helping patients non-surgically, acknowledges that physical therapy might not be enough to resolve symptoms in all cases: “We always want to start with the most conservative measures and up the ante as time goes on, with meds or surgery. But surgery doesn’t change the muscle function, so in many cases, even the surgeon will want their patient to undergo physical therapy.”Rodríguez, a surgeon, concurs: “I am a strong believer in physical therapy, and pilates is also quite good in getting people to engage the pelvic floor.”The best thing I ever did about my incontinence was start talking about it. Chances are, if you share, you’ll learn that you’re not alone. If you’re really lucky, you’ll even find someone to laugh with you about it. And if you pee a little when you do, you won’t be the only one.Amanda Klarsfeld is a freelance writer in New York CityExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyAgeingWomen's healthWomenHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But language isn’t a fortressWed 4 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 11.35 EDTShareIn Shakespeare’s Henry VI, Part II, a messenger breathlessly announces to the king that, “Jack Cade hath gotten London bridge”. Hold this late 16th-century text in mind as we fast forward to last week when Martin Kettle, associate editor and columnist at the Guardian in the UK, was seen to suggest in anopinion piecethat, if King Charles has pushed the boundaries of neutrality, such as with his speech to open the new Canadian parliament, he has so far “gotten away with it”.In aletterpublished the next day, a reader asked teasingly if this use of “gotten” – and another writer’s reference to a “faucet” – were signs the Guardian had fallen into line with Donald Trump’s demand that news agencies adopt current US terminology, such as referring to the “Gulf of America”.Another, who wrote to me separately, had first seen the article in the print edition and expected subeditors (or copy editors, if you wish) would eventually catch up and remove “gotten”, which “is not a word in British English”. She was surprised to find the online version not only unchanged but with the phrase repeated in the headline.How misusing words can even change their dictionary definitions | Elisabeth RibbansRead moreQueries over US English spellings or “Americanisms” form a small but steady strand of correspondence to my office; “normalcy”, “airplane” and “hot flash” are among recent contested usages. We explain that while the Guardian was founded in the UK, and this remains its biggest edition, it is 204 years later a global media organisation with two-thirds of its digital audience outside the UK. And the reason some articles use American English is that they are produced by Guardian US, which was launched in September 2007 and works (like Guardian Australia, established in 2013) to serve readers in that country as well as globally. Naturally, local spelling and grammar is followed, although all Guardian articles share a website and one with wider appeal may appear on the front of the UK online edition. Only if a US story is to run in the printed newspaper is it re-edited for British English.The difference in language works both ways, occasionally leading an American eye to mistake British spelling in an online article for error. “The word ‘defense’ was spelled ‘defence’ over and over!” wrote one reader. “I don’t need a job, but I’d be happy to help with your editing.”I can only hope the above explanation reduces consternation.Getting back to “gotten”, which has been described by the linguist David Crystal in his Cambridge Encyclopedia of the EnglishLanguageas “probably the most distinctive of all the [American English/British English] grammatical differences”. Well, to set the record straight, this did not come from Kettle’s pen. He wrote “got” but there was an unwanted change during the editing process, with “gotten” also making it into the web headline. In my view, it was right that the published piece was subsequently amended back to the writer’s voice.However, it would be a mistake to regard language as a fortress. It has always changed. “Gotten” was used in Middle English and Early Modern English (Shakespeare uses it five times, says Crystal), before falling largely out of use in Britain by the early 1800s, except in “ill-gotten”. Early copies of the Guardian show some remnant sprinklings: in 1842, it reported that special constables in Rochdale, whose wages had gone unpaid, feared “this money had gotten into wrong hands”.But in the US, where this past participle of “get” had travelled with English colonists, its use continued, and lately appears to be making a return to base. “It’s certainly in young people’s speech now,” says Crystal. “I don’t use it at all, but Ben [his son and often co-author] does. You can see the rise in usage if you do an Ngram search,” he adds, sending me aGoogle graphshowing frequency in books, with a steep upward curve from around the start of this century.The other British invasion: how UK lingo conquered the USRead moreCrystal says it is also important to note that Americansuse both got and gotten. “What this means is that Brits are likely to overuse gotten, thinking it’s always a replacement for got, when it isn’t.”Rebecca Nicholson, who inreviewingthe BBC documentary The Rise and Fall of Michelle Mone, had ventured that “once you turn on the faucet of public attention, trying to turn it off again is a sisyphean task”, was amazed to find she had written “faucet”, and could only think that in the moment it “sounded better”.Such “borrowing” is a way that natural language shift occurs, and I see the extra force here in “faucet”. Nicholson can also summonhistory in her defence. The OED tells us that, in its first sense, faucet is “a wooden tap for drawing liquid from a barrel, cask, or tub”, deriving from the French “fausette” or “fausset” and with earliest known use in Middle English. As a later word for a plumbing fixture, it is “chiefly US”, with speakers of English elsewhere typically using “tap”.And there, in whichever glorious variety of English you use, we turn off – but your messages are welcome to flow.Elisabeth Ribbans is the Guardian’s global readers’ editorguardian.readers@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsReference and languages booksOpen doorLanguageLanguagescommentShareReuse this content"

A what? I took this to be a typo, a typo that happened to suit him quite well. But he claimed an edgelord was an actual thing. He defined it as a person who specialises in edgy opinions, especially if they don’t really believe them.I checked with a few people who are more across the ways of the world than I seem to be these days: my daughters, a neighbour, an on-trend colleague or two. Blank looks all around. “Sounds dirty,” said one of my BBC colleagues. Then I asked one of my handlers at the Guardian, who not only knew the word but also failed to hide their surprise that I hadn’t. Which just goes to show that this publication is indeed at the cutting edge of things, even if some of its writers need educating.Edgelord isn’t in my Chambers dictionary, and WhatsApp itself doesn’t recognise the word. The laptop on which I’m writing this, however, is comfortable with it, offering no squiggly red line beneath the word. The Merriam-Webster dictionary and Dictionary.com both have it, but they’re American, so are not, in my view, to be fully trusted in these matters.I bet myself that the Oxford English Dictionary would have no truck with this nonsense – but no, here it is: “A person who affects a provocative or extreme persona, esp online.” Furthermore, the OED says the word has been about since 2013 and was “attested earliest in the context of video gaming, denoting a type of online player who customizes his or her character’s appearance, username, etc, in a manner deemed to be overly self-serious”. I’m not sure what the OED thinks it is doing spelling customises with a z, by the way, but I’ll let that pass.Not for the first time, I feel clever and foolish at the same time. Clever for knowing what an edgelord is when others don’t; foolish for taking 12 years to join the party. As a new recruit, it ill becomes me to be picky, but surely there’s a gender issue here. I’ve come across several female edgelords in my time. What are we to call them? Not edgeladies, surely? But what else? And another thing: what’s the opposite of an edgelord? Perhaps they are thought so dull, they don’t merit a name of their own.Now I’m seeing edgelords everywhere. I may even see one when I look in the mirror. They’re not just online, either – they’re to be found in conversations everywhere, at work and at play. Saying whatever they think it takes in order to be heard and seen, to help them feel relevant.The edgelord community is a broad church indeed, encompassing everyone from common-or-garden bar bores to the vilest of internet trolls to the most erudite of columnists. In a society of short and shrinking attention spans, their lordships provide an essential service for all of us. We crave something different, something radical, something interesting, whether or not it’s complete bollocks. If we don’t like or believe whatever edgelordery we’re listening to, our anger makes us feel alive. If we like what we hear, we’ll repeat it in order to edgelord it over others. But if too many edgelords spout the same line, it will soon lose its edge. This means some edgelord or other will have to come up with something new. And so it goes on.The edgelords need to be aware of something important, though: they play with fire. Because what started as an opinion they only conceived in order to shock may, like Tolkien’s ring, overwhelm them. It will become their truth, and the edgelord will turn into Gollum.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSocial etiquetteOpinionLanguagecommentShareReuse this content"

I’m not one of themNick WilliamsThe legislation is a product of joined-up environmental thinking – aiming to create housing while preventing nature lossNick Williams was an economic policy adviser to Keir Starmer between 2023 and 2025, having previously worked in HM TreasuryWed 4 Jun 2025 08.33 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 12.02 EDTShareIn recent weeks, various nature groups and newspaper columnists have promoted claims that the government’s flagship planning and infrastructure bill is a“nature sellout”. The argument goes that the government is conspiring with malign developers todestroy irreplaceable habitatsas a first resort. This sounds alarming, if only it were true.The truth is that our current framework for protecting habitats has been in place for decades but has failed to prevent nature loss. This is because we approach conservation in the least effective way possible, with tens of thousands of individual site-by-site protections. Ecological science is clear that this is outdated. Modern conservation strategies recognise the necessity of interconnectivity and scale for supporting complex ecosystems.As well as failing nature, this system adds yet more costs and barriers to the new homes and infrastructure our country needs, because builders are distracted by cooking up well-meaning but ultimately piecemeal mitigation schemes with questionable impact, such as the nowinfamous HS2 bat tunnel, which is ridiculed by environmentalists and industrialists alike.Without more homes, wealth will continue to concentrate and homelessness will grow. Without better infrastructure, we cannot build more prosperous communities across the Midlands and north. And without getting smarter, habitat decline is inevitable. The status quo will see more young people robbed of the joy of nature, the security and socioeconomic mobility that previous generations enjoyed, and it will hinder our efforts to tackle the climate crisis. Something needs to change.The government has proposed a solution. The bill will establish a nature restoration fund, which will support a number of strategic nature restoration schemes across the country at a scale that is genuinely impactful.Natural England will produce a series of “environmental delivery plans”, underpinned by ecological science, explaining how it will deliver an “overall improvement in conservation status” for a given environmental feature. This test is set out in the legislation. Unlike now, performance will be regularly measured against what was promised and the approach in the plans must be amended if they are not delivering. This will mean results are easier to evaluate and scrutinise, as well as making enforcement simpler. Crucially these schemes will operate across council boundaries, because nature does. Instead of creating their own bespoke schemes, developers will financially contribute to much greater environmental outcomes nationally. This is what is meant by a “win-win”.Noise about the legislation misses the point that nothing changes until the delivery plans are in place. That is where the action is. Until they are in place, the existing safeguards persists. And until draft plans are published, there is a vacuum in which alarm can thrive. So let’s debunk some myths.Green spaces will not vanish. Amenity green space is vital for healthy, fulfilling lives, which is why it is a core principle and given protected designation by the government’s new national planning policy framework, and new green spaces created with funds already levied on development. However, local parks and ponds are not great banks of biodiversity, and are no substitute for the woods and wetlands we need at scale. The creation of those habitats will be made possible with the funds levied.Rare habitats such as chalk streams will not be destroyed under the promise of new habitats elsewhere. This is an obviously ridiculous caricature; any such proposal would not pass the hurdles set out in the legislation and NaturalEnglandwould never claim it can create a new chalk stream.This has not been cooked up in a smoke-filled room with the volume housebuilders. On the contrary, I know first-hand that environmental leaders were intimately involved in its development, which is why organisations like RSPB, Wildlife Trust and Green Alliance were supportive when the Bill was published. . Regretfully, some havechanged their tune, and nowprefer to defend regulationsover defending nature.The proposal is not perfect, but it isn’t intended to be. It will take years to be fully implemented and even that is subject to Natural England securing Treasury support in the forthcoming spending review. But it is a serious reform and it must be viewed within the wider context of what this government is doing.The government’s land use framework proposes to support farmers to deliver nature and climate benefits across 1.6 million hectares of land – more than the total developed for housing – by 2050. Meanwhile, it has banned bee-killing pesticides and the burning of peatlands, and its farming roadmap supports a shift towards regenerative farming methods.By comparison, just 30,000 hectares of land will be developed to deliver 1.5m homes this parliament, and, over the same period, if current rates of tree planting are sustained, more than double will be used to create new forests.John Cunliffe’s reviewlooks set to recommend a shift to nature-based solutions to flooding and water pollution. Replacing concrete with more reed- and tree-lined banks will benefit billpayers and the environment.While the government has walked into a fight with environmental groups, it is also quietly getting on with radical change to enhance our green and pleasant land.Nick Williams was an economic policy adviser to Keir Starmer between 2023 and 2025, having previously worked in HM TreasuryExplore more on these topicsPlanning policyOpinionConstruction industryWildlifeEnglandEconomic growth (GDP)commentShareReuse this content"

The chancellor needs to raise revenues, fastWed 4 Jun 2025 11.36 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 13.03 EDTShareSir Keir Starmer is pledgingto make Britain “battle-ready”by spending billions of pounds on arms factories, drones and submarines. Rachel Reeves says shewill invest £15bnin trams, buses and trains for towns and cities outside London. The announcements by the prime minister and chancellor followed last month’spartial U-turnon the means testing of pensioners’ winter fuel allowance. Anyone could be forgiven for thinking the tough times were over and that money was now no object.Nothing could be further from the truth. The spending review Reeves will deliver next week comes at a time when growth is weak and borrowing high. The brutal reality is that if more is to be spent on defence and the NHS, if the police are to be handed extra resources to tackle crime, and if pledges to hit housebuilding and net zero targets are to be fulfilled, something has to give. And that something will be higher taxes in the budget. It is just a matter of which taxes and who pays them.Reeves could simply borrow more money to fund increases in spending. That’s precisely what happened during the global financial crisis of 2008-09 and during the pandemic. It is what would happen again in the event that the new cold war turned into a real shooting match. When things are really bad, governments abandon all thoughts of financial probity, spend whatever it takes and think about the consequences later.Short of a full-blown crisis, there is no way Reeves is going to throw caution to the wind. Her room for manoeuvre is limited by her self-imposedfiscal rules– that over time national debt should be falling as a share of national income, and that day-to-day spending should be covered by tax receipts. The first of these affects the level of capital spending and was tweaked in last autumn’s budget to make possible the welcome increases in spending on transport infrastructure for less well-off parts of the country. Even so, the debt rule still means there are constraints on capital spending, and the more that is invested in military hardware, the less will be available for everything else.In the short term, it is the second rule that makes life difficult for Reeves. Unsurprisingly, given the neglect of the public realm in the 14 years of Conservative rule, there are powerful arguments for higher day-to-day spending, but the chancellor has insisted these must be covered by tax receipts. This rule – “iron-clad” according to Reeves – is policed by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which provides outside scrutiny of the state of the public finances. If the OBR says the rule is going to be broken, Reeves can only avoid raising taxes if she is prepared to sayit is not so “iron-clad”after all.There is a case for doing this. The OBR is far from infallible and its assessment is based on judgment calls on what will happen to the economy over the coming years. Cutting spending or raising taxes on the basis of views that might change within a matter of months is not sensible policymaking. At the very least, there should be less frequent OBR assessments – a changerecently recommendedby the International Monetary Fund.Rachel Reeves must think big to fund Labour’s ‘battle-ready’ Britain. Tweaks and tinkering won’t do | Polly ToynbeeRead moreBritain currently has a system where the level of public spending is determined by what the Treasury and the OBR says the country can afford, rather than a system where it is determined by what the country actually needs. Those needs are many and will cost plenty to put right.The prisons are full, the roads are potholed, the police say the fight against crime is being hampered by a lack of cash.There is no longer a peace dividend to fund higher welfare spending. Voters think the NHS needs extra resources, and after the furore over the winter fuel allowance, it will be a brave government that floats the idea of scrappingthe triple lockguaranteeing that the state pension rises in line with either inflation, earnings or a minimum of 2.5%.Rapid growth would help but seems unlikely. A complete rethink of borrowing rules is not being considered. As a result, unless the state is going to shrink in size, the government has to be prepared to raise taxes. That’s not a popular message, to say the least, especially when taxes are on course toreach the highest shareof national income in more than 70 years.This is understandable. The recent cost of living crisis eroded living standards and made the public hostile to the idea of paying more tax. Voters think higher spending is a good idea – but only if somebody else foots the bill. This would make it a political no-no to raise VAT rates and income tax, even if that were not already ruled out by Labour’s election manifesto commitment.So Reeves needs to think creatively about ways to raise revenue. A fresh freeze on income tax allowances and thresholds is one possibility, although it would hit the pockets of working people, and almost certainly lead to a bigger opinion poll lead for Reform UK.But there are other options. Atax on financial transactionsis one. Limiting pension tax relief to the basic rate of income tax – assuggested by the tax expertRichard Murphy – is another. But no matter what Reeves chooses, she needs to start making the case now that you can’t get better public services on the cheap.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEconomicsOpinionRachel ReevesTaxTax and spendingLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

I urge them to defend their principlesGus Casely-Hayford is director of London’s V&A EastWed 4 Jun 2025 10.32 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 13.00 EDTShareIn one of his recent Truth Social posts, Donald Trumpappeared to fireKim Sajet – the fearless and utterly brilliant director of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC. The president used his social media platform to claim that Sajet’s support for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) made her unsuitable for her role. “Upon the request and recommendation of many people, I am hereby terminating the employment of Kim Sajet as Director of the National Portrait Gallery”, Trump wrote. “She is a highly partisan person, and a strong supporter of DEI, which is totally inappropriate for her position. Her replacement will be named shortly.”Where to start? By now, we all know the arts has become the terrain for a brutal proxy battle for hearts and minds. A culture war 2.0, where not just reputations are at stake, but institutions, whole sectors and ways of thinking. But I am hoping that even Trump’s support base have begun to grow a little bored with these attacks on figures and institutions in the cultural sector. The culture war has moved beyond farce into the deeply tragic.I am sure even many of the president’s most loyal supporters know deep down that the Smithsonian (a vast complex of 21 museums) is a genuine force for good, an institution that represents so much of the US at its very best. And like the Kennedy Center, the cultural institution that Trumptook control ofearlier this year, or the universitieshis administration has attacked, the Smithsonian is a fish in a barrel: easy to bully, its financial destiny in significant part tied to public funding, with limited scope to defend itself. This contrived political theatre damages critical institutions, threatens the careers of talented, dedicated people, and its repercussions will be deep and long-lasting.Good museums are not sleepy institutions trapped in heritage-aspic. Across its 178-year history, the Smithsonian has consistently evolved to reflect ambient change and address public need. Like many other national museums around the world, these changes, particularly in recent years, have been driven by an aspiration to engage and enfranchise, to broaden audiences and to catalyse national conversations. I would have thought that seeking to give value back to a greater number of the population is uncontroversial. Institutions this important, mostly sponsored by the public, must simply, continually, work to be ever more universal, inclusive and open. Left or right, that has value. In times like these, when we are, as citizens of western democracies, so riven and divided, the arts have a job to do of being a space for inclusive debate.But the truth is that DEI isn’t some new-fangled indulgence. That drive to be inclusive is what good museums were created to deliver. Twenty-five years ago, I began my career at the British Museum. I still remember reading its founding purpose for the first time. The British Museum was created for “all studious and curious persons”. I remember thinking that the word that does the really hard work in that statement is “all”. The British Museum was created in the mid-18th century around an inclusive imperative, around the idea that we might all hope to find ourselves reflected in its spaces and concerns.Its founders must have recognised the powerful need for a national museum: it was created at a time when Britain was going through a period of existential anxiety, when Scots were rebelling; the country needed a unifying narrative. I am sure the British Museum’s founders knew exactly what they were doing when they committed the institution to that beautifully enfranchising ambition of being for us all. And yes, I know museums have so often failed miserably to live up to these inclusive objectives, but we must never stop trying, nor relinquish the basis on which the public can hold us to account.Universities and museums are vital for healthy societies, and their independence, their bravery, their sometimes maddening honesty, underpins so much that is important. We undermine that at our peril. I spent a number of treasured years as a Smithsonian museum director and fell for its ethos and its dedicated people. It was founded on an ambition to propagate “the increase and diffusion of knowledge”. It was created to enable transformational change through sharing and empowering US citizens with knowledge, with truth. I cannot think of a time when this has been more important.It is unclear whether Trump has the authority to fire Sajet. What is clear is that his move is designed to demoralise her and all my former Smithsonian colleagues. That’s why, directing a different museum now, across the Atlantic, I feel moved to write. We in the cultural sector everywhere need to stand up and be counted, we need to celebrate Kim Sajet, we need to not retreat from diversity here in Britain. To my former colleagues,I say that speaking the truth and having the courage to do so when it is difficult does not make you unsuitable for your roles in a demographically complex democracy; it is probably the most important aspect of what we are called upon to do. It is easy writing the diversity action plan, but having the moral courage to stand up for those principles when they are needed – that is heroic.Gus Casely-Hayford is a curator, cultural historian, broadcaster and lecturer who is currently the director ofV&A EastExplore more on these topicsMuseumsOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

In presenting its much-heraldedstrategic defence reviewand calling for a new national resolve, it not only treated parliament with contempt – making big policy announcements outside the House of Commons – it gave the country ludicrously exaggerated claims for a “defence dividend”: the idea that increasing investment in the defence sector will boost growth and create high-quality jobs. It failed to explain why money for arms should be a better stimulus for the economy than, say, funding nurseries.The government claims that the world has become so much more dangerous that a “root and branch” review of defence is needed. It claims that transformation and innovation are essential. Except there is very little that is innovative or transformative about the new approach. The programme it has come up with is a doubling down on the old – on the renovation of the “sovereign nuclear warhead” programme (to be mounted on very un-sovereign US-made and maintained missiles), on up to12 new nuclear powered submarines, on cyber and drones, which have been staples in defence procurement discussion for well over a decade. The US remains, despite everything, Britain’s “first partner”, with whom ties should be strengthened. This is no great rupture with the past. And, as many have pointed out, there is a huge gap between the rhetoric and the spending, which will merely increase from 2.3% to 2.5% of GDP.How are we to explain this?Labour has relished the opportunity to present itself as the party of rearmament, just as Tony Blair gleefully believed he was the first to make the Labour party a war party. Its unseemly enthusiasm is reflected in Keir Starmer’s childish talk of “a battle-ready, armour-clad nation” or of British “warriors”. The prime minister even claimed “we will innovate and accelerate innovation to a wartime pace” and become “the fastest innovator in Nato”. This is Labour wanting to become the Tory party of its imagination, to purge itself of the stain of social democracy, to indulge itself in nationalist nostalgia, not least for wartime.There was a time when Labour was proud to claim it was the party of the welfare state. More recently, the Labour right has insisted that it was also the party of the “warfare state” – Nye Bevan’s NHS is proudly paired with Ernie Bevin’s Nato (Bevin was an architect of the north Atlantic alliance). There is more truth in this narrative than many social democrats care to admit: Labour’s postwar government pushed defence spending to around 10% of GDP, under pressure from the Americans. What is too often forgotten is that those in the know knew that such levels of rushed expenditure would not produce what was promised and would damage underlying British growth. Among them were then minister of labour and national service, Nye Bevan, Harold Wilson, president of the Board of Trade, and John Freeman, a junior minister in the Ministry of Supply (that is, of armaments). They resigned and they were proved right.The UK did enjoy a so-called peace dividend from the mid-1950s, as defence expenditure fell relative to GDP and welfare spending. The Labour party now appears to believe that military procurement will generate growth. Khem Rogaly, a researcher at Common Wealth, a progressive thinktank, has studied the relations of defence spending and jobs, and observes that “this is not a serious industrial or jobs strategy”.Still, Starmer claims a “defence dividend” will result from a 0.2 percentage point of GDP increase in spending and that there will be national and regional renewal through arms contracts. This feeds nostalgia for (male) skilled jobs, but it is not a serious proposition. In any case, there is no reason at all to believe that a defence dividend for the economy would be higher than a green energy, housing, NHS, or university dividend – andplenty to believe it will be a lot less. In any case, if defence itself is really as important as they say, there will be very good reasons to continue buying weapons overseas, whichwill happen in practice, instead of pining for national sufficiency. It might be sensible to give the defence dividend to those with a track record of successful design and manufacture, for example, German tank and gun makers, even Ukrainian drone makers.There are some things to welcome in the government’s announcements and the strategic defence review itself. There is a palpable sense that things have gone very wrong, that it is no longer appropriate to think of the UK as having by far and away the best armed services in Europe. The usual dishonest superlatives are lacking. There is nothing “world-beating” here, and only a little is world-leading. The once routine claim that the UK is a force for good in the world is missing. There is recognition that public investment in factories is needed. “Nato first” is better than Tory-era fantasies of an Indo-Pacific tilt.But the fundamental problem remains – there is no thinking about alternative foreign policies or defence policies; the government is still focused on UK defence ties to the Middle East and east Asia. For every sensible proposal, such as the need to build stockpile weapons and improve the procurement machinery, there is a failure to think through the UK’s real place in the world, and to face up to the failures of the defence and foreign policy of the past quarter century.Keir Starmer wants to “mobilise the nation in a common cause” and claims that “nothing works unless we all work together”. But that requires a genuine and serious consensus about aims and consistency in principles. Supporting the territorial integrity of Ukraine, and fighting against the illegal Russian invasion and violations of the laws of war, is a good thing. But it has been noticed by many that the UK has been steadfast in its logistical and political support to an ally, Israel, in illegal occupation of territories that are subject to the war crime of collective punishment on an appalling scale. A root and branch review is indeed desperately needed, but that can only happen if we have a political class prepared to recognise that the old formulas will no longer do. It is easy to talk the talk of change and innovation; achieving that requires a genuine rupture with the assumptions of the past and present.David Edgerton is Hans Rausing professor of the history of science and technology and professor of modern British history at King’s College London.

In 2014, George Osborne promised a “northern powerhouse” to rival the dominance of London and the south-east. He pledged devolution and investment in infrastructure to connect northern cities, to unlock productivity and growth.Since then, Britain’s economy has suffered multiple shocks, some external (the pandemic, inflation stoked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine), others self-inflicted (Brexit, Liz Truss’s mini-budget). Each time, the damage was more severe in places already falling behind. Boris Johnson claimed levelling up as his defining purpose. Rishi Sunak let the ambition slide. Now it is being revived by a Labour chancellor. Ina speechannouncing transport investments on Wednesday, Ms Reeves promised a “renewal of Britain”, with prosperity built on “broad foundations” and a break from the failed model that relied on “a handful of places forging ahead of the rest”.There was material support behind that commitment – £15.6bn offunding for local transportin regions across northern England and the Midlands. Less measurable but arguably more significant over time is the pledge to rewrite Treasury rules for evaluating return on public investment. The current model encodes a bias in favour of putting new infrastructure in places that are already prosperous.Changing that calculus, alongside revisions made last year to fiscal rules on borrowing for capital spending, givesLabourmore scope and more fiscal firepower to direct money to needy parts of the country. Ms Reeves promises a £300bn uplift in public investment over the course of this parliament – the highest level since the 1970s. More detail on how this will be spent is expected when a 10-year infrastructure plan is launched later this month.The government hopes that these upbeat messages about investment and regeneration will sugar-coat theless palatable doseof fiscal medicine that Ms Reeves is due to administer next week in the comprehensive spending review. What flexibility the Treasury has afforded itself for capital investment does not extend to day-to-day departmental spending. There, the picture will be grim, with real-terms cuts in all but a handful of protected budgets.The combination of austerity in the short to medium term with investment over the longer term amounts to a colossal political gamble. The chancellor cannot realistically expect promised future benefits from transport, housing and other projects to comfort people whose dailylived experienceis dilapidated services, shrinking benefits and councils on the brink of bankruptcy.In her speech on Wednesday, Ms Reeves spoke of “spades in the ground” by 2028 and fleets of new vehicles coming on stream by 2032. With an election due in 2029, those timelines don’t offer much prospect of a feelgood factor sufficient to persuade voters to let Labour complete the job of national renewal in a second term.Strategic planning that looks beyond the electoral cycle is admirable as statecraft. But it fails as politics without a more compelling narrative of collective national purpose and a palpable sense that things are getting better.

A ceasefire, hostage release and proper resumption of aid remain essentialWed 4 Jun 2025 13.26 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 14.22 EDTShareAfull, independent investigation into thekillings of Palestiniansattempting to collect food for their family, and accountability for their deaths, is essential. But no investigation is needed to establish that Israel is ultimately responsible, by starving people and then implementing a food-collection scheme that cannot solve the humanitarian crisis, and which is known to be dangerous. The US, which promoted that scheme, is complicit.Health officials in Gaza say that at least 27 people were killed by Israeli fire as they awaited food on Tuesday – thethird such incidentin three days. (The Israeli military said troops fired at people “moving towards [them] … in a way that posed a threat”.) Officials previously said that Israeli forceskilled more than 30 Palestinianson Sunday, and another three the following day; the military said they did not shoot civilians, but fired “warning shots”. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) – the American private organisation running the scheme –suspended operationson Wednesday for “update, organisation and efficiency improvement work”.No update can fix this: the food scheme itself is the problem. The UN and aid agencies feared that it breached international law and refused to work with the GHF; the founding directorresigned, saying that GHF would not be able to deliver aid while adhering to humanitarian principles. Senior Israeli military officials reportedlyraised concerns. Many people cannot reach the sites. Those who do face a greater risk of having meagre supplies snatched by other desperate people. Essential non-food goods such as medications are not included. The risk of shootings was clear: armed American contractors run the three sites and Israeli troops control the surrounding areas. Palestinians are forced to choose – risk their lives or watch their children starve.After 11 weeks of total siege, followed by a trickle of supplies, Gaza isthe hungriest place on Earth, says the UN. It was never plausible that this scheme could feed it. It is a fig leaf for Israel’s continued starvation of civilians, and helps displace them to an ever smaller area. The far-right minister Bezalel Smotrich hassaidthat Gaza will be “entirely destroyed” so that its population will “leave in great numbers to third countries”. In short, ethnic cleansing.The use of food as a weapon comes in addition to strikes on schools being used as shelters, the destruction of hospitals and the killing of tens of thousands of civilians. Israel’s war crimes have caused public support toplummetin western Europe and fall markedly in the US. Yet politicians are lagging. Sir Keir Starmer calls the situation “intolerable”, but until the UK acts decisively it is, in reality, tolerating it. The UK, France and Canada warned of “concrete measures” and must follow through. The US could stop this conflict tomorrow, but the European Union, Israel’s biggest trading partner, alsohas real power. It is now reviewing its trade agreement with Israel; it should suspend it. Improving aid is a necessary but not sufficient demand. The need is created by the war. The real solution is still a ceasefire and release of the hostages seized by Hamas on 7 October 2023.As Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross,has warned, international law itself is being hollowed out – with profound implications for conflicts to come. As long as Israel enjoys impunity, more Palestinians die and human lives everywhere are cheapened. It must be held accountable.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

On a three-match losing streak while closing in on his 38th birthday, he had, in his own words, entered a “new reality”. Djokovic reasoned that his results simply reflected the circle of life. It was inevitable that the circle will eventually close.There was nothing at all new about the level exhibited by Djokovic on a glorious Thursday night in Paris as he turned back the clock with a vintage offering. Djokovic, the sixth seed in Paris, completely outplayed the third seed Alexander Zverev to return to the semi-finals of theFrench Openwith a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 victory.Wildcard Boisson drinks in French Open fairytale run after reaching semisRead moreDjokovic is the oldest man to reach the French Open semi-finals since Pancho Gonzales in 1968 and he has now reached 51 grand slam semi-finals, extending his own all-time record. “Tonight is one of those reasons why I still keep playing,” he said.Life will become more difficult for Djokovic when he faces world No 1Jannik Sinnerin the semi-final on Friday. Sinner continued his imperious march through the draw with an emphatic 6-1, 7-5, 6-0 win over Alexander Bublik of Kazakhstan. Sinner is still yet to drop a set and he has won 19 consecutive matches at grand slams after recent triumphs at the US Open and Australian Open.Djokovic entered Court Philippe-Chatrier with unfinished business after being forced to withdraw from his Australian Open semi-final against Zverev in January. He had produced a stellar performance to defeat Carlos Alcaraz in the last eight, fighting through a hamstring strain that finally downed him in Melbourne. Having started the year radiating confidence, that injury would prove the start of three extremely difficult months on the tour.On the eve of the French Open, Djokovic found his way again by winning his 100th career title at a small tournament in Geneva. Still it was unclear if he was truly ready to elevate his level against one of the best. The early exchanges further underlined the high standard required as Djokovic opened up the match with a sloppy service game against a locked-in Zverev, who immediately broke his serve. Zverev played an excellent opening set, serving brilliantly, imposing himself with his forehand and outlasting Djokovic in the attritional exchanges.View image in fullscreenAlexander Zverev (right) embraces Novak Djokovic after their men’s singles semi-final.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty ImagesNobody understands the ebb and flow of a best-of-five marathon like Djokovic, who calmly shrugged off the lost opening set. He built rhythm on his serve and tried to put as many returns in the court as possible while calmly waiting for his moment. At 2-1 in set two, Djokovic was rewarded for his patience. In his attempts to maintain pressure on the Serbian, tense unforced errors began to leak from Zverev’s racket, and Djokovic earned his first break.Having faced each other 13 previous occasions and trained together many more times, there are no secrets. Djokovic picked apart Zverev’s game the same way he has done many times before. He used his drop shot astoundingly well, continually taking advantage of the massive space left by Zverev’s deep court positioning with perfectly timed and executed drop shots and he served brilliantly in the decisive moments. Djokovic also chose his moments to serve and volley and was efficient when he approached the net. For a man with so many miles in his legs, his court coverage and durability remains staggering.As the match endured, Djokovic controlled the baseline with his forehand and when they found themselves locked in backhand exchanges, only Djokovic was willing to change direction and force his way out. He dismantled one of the best players in the world with surgical precision. Regardless of how the tournament continues, the fact that he can still compete at a high level at 38 is an incredible achievement in its own right.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His enormous serve, movement and physicality makes him an incredibly difficult opponent to face on almost any day and he has built a strong résumé during his years at the top.However, the story of Zverev’s career so far is that in the decisive moments of the grand slam tournaments, while the greatest players are desperate to seize the moment, he cowers. As Djokovic bulldozed his path to the semi-finals, it was clear that both players on the court knew this all too well.Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025Jannik SinnerNovak DjokovicFrench OpenTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The club were determined to bring in a new striker this summer and have moved swiftly to secure one of their top targets.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreDelap, who has signed a six-year deal, chose to join Chelsea after receiving pitches from Everton, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest and Manchester United. The 22-year-old scored 12 goals for Ipswich last season and was available at an affordable price following their relegation from the Premier League. Chelsea met the release clause in his contract last week.Enzo Maresca knows Delap from his time at Manchester City and played a key role in convincing the England Under-21 international to pick Chelsea. The forward, who joined Ipswich from City last summer, has been asked to miss the Under-21 European Championship in order to represent his new team at the Club World Cup.“I understand the stature of this club and can see the trajectory it is on with these players and the head coach,” Delap told Chelsea’s website. “It’s going to be an incredible place for me to develop, and I hope to achieve amazing things here and help the club win more trophies.”Quick GuideInzaghi joins Al-Hilal as Fábregas plays down Inter linksShowSimone Inzaghi has been appointed coach of Al-Hilal, the Saudi Pro League side announced on Wednesday.

Inzaghi's first task will be to take charge of Al-Hilal at the Club World Cup in the US; they will face Real Madrid on 18 June in their group opener.Earlier on Wednesday, Cesc Fàbregas pledged his immediate managerial future to Como amid speculation that the Spaniard is Inter's main target to replace Inzaghi.The former Arsenal, Barcelona and Chelsea midfielder has attracted the attention of several top clubs after leading promoted Como to 10th place in Serie A.'I really believe in Como's long-term project, I arrived here as a player and I'm very, very happy because I can work here the way I want,\" Fàbregas, who is also a shareholder in the club he manages, said at the SXSW (South By Southwest) conference in London.

Tammy Beaumont, meanwhile, followed up with a second consecutive hundred of her own, despite battling what she jokingly described as “man flu”.The decision of Charlotte Edwards, the head coach, to reunite the pair after a five-year break now looks like a masterstroke, after they became the first players in ODI history to share consecutive partnerships of more than 200. Beaumont said: “We know each other really well, we’ve known each other for years and years. I couldn’t have asked for it to go better.“I’m so proud of [Amy] backing up that first century at Derby, in even better style, and pretty much having to manage my man flu at times. For her to take that lead role there and look after me, as well as go and play like that, was outstanding.”England beat West Indies by 143 runs in  second women’s cricket ODI – live reactionRead moreMatthews had been ruled out before play because of a shoulder injury, presumably sustained after carrying the entire weight of her team all tour. She spent the ­England innings stalking the boundary in a sling; she will see a specialist on Thursday to assess whether she is able to play any part in the final ODI at Taunton on Saturday.West Indies were also without their hard-hitting opener Qiana Joseph with flu, but the 20‑year‑old Realeanna Grimmond proved a ready replacement, striking a 64-ball half‑century on ODI debut.Grimmond seemed unfazed at being asked to open, even when she was struck on the forearm by a ferocious Lauren Filer, who clocked 75mph in her first international match since the Ashes. The young West Indies batter clobbered Lauren Bell for two sixes over the leg side, before finally holing out to long-on in the 23rd over.Kate Cross then became just the eighth Englishwoman to reach 100 ODI wickets, with a little bit of help from DRS – UltraEdge concluding definitively that she had caught the under-edge of Aaliyah Alleyne’s bat on the way through to Jones behind the stumps. Cross sat out the winter’s Ashes series with a back injury, and has admitted she felt her international career might be over, stuck for ever on 98 ODI scalps; this felt like vindication for all those hours spent in agonising rehab.View image in fullscreenRealeanna Grimmond’s 53 was not enough for West Indies to mount a competitive run chase.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesWest Indies were always going far too slowly to threaten England’s target, but they made the bowlers sweat for their series win: two DRS reviews burned; two catches shelled; a wild onslaught of 44 from 24 balls by Jannillea ­Glasgow; and a defiant tail which added 69 runs between the fall of the seventh and 10th wickets – 44 of them in boundaries. Finally, in the 46th over, Alice Capsey had Cherry‑Ann Fraser caught at point and the celebrations could begin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She admitted on the eve of this match that she had been disappointed, five years ago, to be bumped down into the middle order by the then-coach Lisa Keightley: “Having the chance to set the tone is a really cool responsibility.”She certainly did that here, dominating a 202-run partnership with Beaumont. “We complement each other so well,” Beaumont said. “The height difference means we hit dif­ferent lengths in different areas.”Emma Lamb was presumably Edwards’s other contender for the ODI opening spot, but – ­assuming things continue like this – she now needs to get used to sitting around for extended periods before her services are required at No 3. Here, she contributed a nifty knock of 55 from 45 balls, while aggressive cameos from Sophia Dunkley and Capsey helped England to accelerate at the death – albeit not quite at the rocket speeds promised in the early overs.Grimmond had shelled a chance offered up by Jones on 43, diving forward at point, but redeemed herself somewhat by snaffling two impressive catches in the deep in the closing overs. England’s score of 366 left them 12 runs short of their record ODI total – although still with far more than they were ever likely to need.Explore more on these topicsWomen's cricketEngland women's cricket teamWest Indies WomenCricketmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But the focus since Monday has been to look at the bigger picture, which has involved monitoring the reaction of the players to extreme temperatures – with the help of ­biometric tablets and innovative sports-science methods.Tuchel tells Alexander-Arnold to take England defensive role ‘very seriously’Read moreThe players have been asked to take a tablet and cycle for 45 ­minutes at a consistent level inside a tent that has been heated to a minimum of 35C. The Football Association’s experts have been able to track their core body temperatures under stress – with the idea being that it will inform how they manage them at the finals in the US, Canada and Mexico.Eze, who finished the domestic season on a high with the winner for Crystal Palacein the FA Cup finalagainst Manchester City, said it was the first time he had seen such an approach in training.“It was quite difficult to do,” he said. “It was taking the tablets and you had to be on the bike for 45 ­minutes, which is a long time to be on a bike.“You had to keep going and they monitored your heart rate, your actual temperature. It was just understanding and it was definitely helpful … a bit of an insight into ­yourself and how you will cope in those situations.”Cole Palmer, the Chelsea midfielder, said: “It was tough. It was 35C, 36C inside the tents and we had to get to a certain watts [level] on the bike and maintain it. For 45 minutes.”View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel talks to Cole Palmer at England training in Girona.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty ImagesEze has been on fire since he scored his first England goal in the 3-0 victoryagainst Latvia in late March, which was Tuchel’s second game in charge. The first was the 2-0 win against Albania three days before. Tuchel has talked about the goal having inspired Eze, who went back to Palace and finished the season with nine in 13 matches.The one that will always be remembered was against City to secure ­Palace’s first major trophy and a place in the Europa League, although there is a complication on that front because of the majority stake that the club’s co-owner, John Textor, holds in Lyon. The Ligue 1 club have also qualified for the Europa League.

Does women’s football have too many international windows? Does the game offer enough support for players’ wellbeing? And have Chelsea and England rotated and rested players such as Bright sufficiently in the past few years?Second, it should offer anybody else who is not feeling fully fit mentally the reassurance that they are not alone and that – ultimately – nothing is more important than your health. In short, sport would be a much healthier place if more athletes felt empowered to make the difficult decision that Bright has taken.For England, however, in the short term, her absence will undoubtedly leave them weaker for Euro 2025 next month, together with the retirements from international football ofMary EarpsandFran Kirby, in what has turned into surely the most tumultuous week of Sarina Wiegman’s otherwise hugely successful tenure.The European champions will go to the European Championship without three vastly experienced players who have a combined 218 senior caps. That sort of knowhow and leadership will be tricky to replace, even though it will offer young talents a chance to thrive.View image in fullscreenMary Earps celebrates with team-mate Millie Bright during their victorious Euro campaign in 2022. Neither will be in the England team this summer for their title defence.Photograph: Steve Bardens/UEFA/Getty ImagesThere will naturally be many people alarmed by the trio of high‑profile withdrawals. However, each has come for individual reasons. Earps is understood to have been contemplating her decision for more than a year. Kirby had already planned to retire from England duty after Euro 2025 and has brought that move forward after being informed – after “honest conversations” – that she would not be selected in the final squad. Bright revealed in May that she was withdrawing from the games against Portugal and Spain, telling the Daly Brightness podcast last week: “Mentally and physically, I’m probably at my limits. We are humans, we’re not robots. At some point, things will take their toll on you and I just needed time to breathe and switch off.”Nonetheless, there are some questions for Wiegman. On the one hand, her determination to have honest conversations with players about their chances of selection for Euro 2025 will be welcomed by those who appreciate the transparency, but did the England head coach decide too soon that Kirby would not be picked? Was that not a risk, before England’s match against Spain, in case another player who plays in Kirby’s position picked up an injury?Similarly, while both goalkeepers will probably have been glad to hear such honesty and clarity from their coach, was it definitely necessary for Wiegman to decide that Hampton was her No 1 for the European Championship so early – as has been widely reported – rather than encouraging both players to keep battling for the starting jersey and pushing each other to keep improving? We will never know for certain whether that could have made any difference in delaying Earps’s retirement. It was a big call for the Dutchwoman to make, although one where she was possibly in a no-win situation; delay the decision and the topic of “Who is your No 1 keeper?” would have been asked at every media session until England face France on 5 July.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Carli Lloyd played for her country until she was 39. Alex Morgan was almost 35 when she played her final USA fixture last year. More recently, in December, Becky Sauerbrunn announced her retirement aged 39.For England to say farewell to Earps, aged 32, and Kirby, aged 31, and be without 31-year-old Bright this summer, raises questions for the camp internally about whether or not enough is being done to help sustain the careers of these icons and help them to continue thriving at the elite level for as long as those USA stars did.Rachel Daly also retired last year from Lionesses duty at 32.Everything should be looked at from schedules, calendars and recovery periods, to mental wellbeing support, nutrition and whether the environment could be improved, because the national team are saying goodbye to fans’ favourites too soon.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamMary EarpsMillie BrightWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

Ronaldo also had to deal with a young pitch invader who was grabbed by stewards as he tried to approach thePortugalcaptain for a selfie.The hosts had the better of the first half, with the Portugal keeper Diogo Costa making a point-blank save to deny debutant Nick Woltemade’s fizzed effort, then getting down quickly to turn Leon Goretzka’s low shot around the post. Ronaldo spurned the visitors’ best chance, failing to find the corner of the net with a shot on the turn.View image in fullscreenRúben Dias appeals for a foul as Florian Wirtz heads Germany in front.Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPAPortugal were inches away from taking the lead early in the second half as Ronaldo was just unable to connect with Nuno Mendes’ incisive cross, which agonisingly grazed the forward’s studs. Moments later, Wirtz broke the deadlock, heading home a delightful clipped ball over the defence from Joshua Kimmich, who was celebrating his 100thGermanycap.The visitors appealed in vain for a foul, with Rúben Dias adamant he had been obstructed by Woldemate, allowing Wirtz to steer a header beyond Costa and into the far corner. The referee, Slovenia’s Slavko Vincic, reviewed the goal on a pitchside monitor but did not award either a foul or offside, and Wirtz’ opener stood.Quick GuideInzaghi joins Al-Hilal as Fábregas plays down Inter linksShowSimone Inzaghi has been appointed coach of Al-Hilal, the Saudi Pro League side announced on Wednesday. The Italian left Inter on Tuesday after the side's humiliating 5-0 loss in the Champions League final against Paris Saint-Germain last Saturday, and has quickly taken on another managerial job.The Saudi club did not immediately disclose any details about Inzaghi's contract, but Italian media reported that it could be worth up to €30m (£25.3m) per season. Inzaghi's first task will be to take charge of Al-Hilal at the Club World Cup in the US; they will face Real Madrid on 18 June in their group opener.Earlier on Wednesday, Cesc Fàbregas pledged his immediate managerial future to Como amid speculation that the Spaniard is Inter's main target to replace Inzaghi.The former Arsenal, Barcelona and Chelsea midfielder has attracted the attention of several top clubs after leading promoted Como to 10th place in Serie A.'I really believe in Como's long-term project, I arrived here as a player and I'm very, very happy because I can work here the way I want,\" Fàbregas, who is also a shareholder in the club he manages, said at the SXSW (South By Southwest) conference in London. Italian media have reported that Inter want to speak to Fàbregas after Inzaghi left by mutual agreement on Tuesday.ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Martínez made a triple change just before the hour mark, with Juventus winger Conceição replacing Francisco Trinçao on the right side. It was Conceição who changed the game five minutes later, cutting in from the right, driving towards goal and finding the far corner with a 25-yard effort that swerved and dipped.That seemed like a good omen for Portugal – Francisco’s father, Sérgio, scored a hat-trick the last time they beat Germany, at Euro 2000. So it proved five minutes later as Bruno Fernandes played in Nuno Mendes, whose cross found Ronaldo just onside, six yards out, to slot past Marc-André ter Stegen for his 137th international goal.Germany came close to an equaliser when substitute Karim Adeyemi struck the near post from a tight angle, but in the latter stages it was Portugal who looked more likely to score as Julian Nagelsmann’s team ran out of ideas.View image in fullscreenFrancisco Conceiçao (bottom left) beats Marc-André ter Stegen with a long-range strike.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APConceição, who was named player of the match, sent a powerful strike just wide, while Ter Stegen made a miraculous double save to deny substitute Diogo Jota and then Conceição’s shot on the rebound in the dying moments.Still, Portugal’s work was done, and the 2019 Nations League winners advance to a final against either 2021 champions France or the current holders, Spain, at the same venue on Sunday night.“We need to enjoy the victory – we won for the first time in a while against Germany,” Martínez said afterwards. “Tactically we were exceptional and our commitment helped ... it was a team victory. Now we can recover and evaluate … we want another performance with personality in this shirt.”“The defeat is absolutely deserved,” the Germany captain Kimmich said. “We weren’t playing well enough in the first half [and] after going 1-0 up, nothing came of it. We have to learn from this. If we’re not at 100%, we can’t beat a top European team. Today was one of our worst games, purely based on our performance.”Explore more on these topicsNations LeagueGermanyPortugalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

McIlroy had to switch heads early in the week at Quail Hollow after his driver was deemed non-conforming by a United States Golf Association test.The scenario is perfectly common – when club faces become too springy through overuse – and also happened to theeventual champion Scottie Scheffler. The process, though, is meant to be private.Former world No 5 Max Homa carries own bag at US Open qualifier after split from caddieRead moreMcIlroy did not address the media after any round at the US PGA, something he expanded on at the Canadian Open in Toronto on Wednesday. “The PGA was a bit of a weird week,”the Masters championsaid. “I didn’t play well. I didn’t play well the first day, so I wanted to go practise, so that was fine. Second day, we finished late. I wanted to go back and see [McIlroy’s daughter] Poppy before she went to bed. The driver news broke. I didn’t really want to speak on that.“Saturday, I was supposed to tee off at 8.20 in the morning. I didn’t tee off until almost 2 in the afternoon, another late finish, was just tired, wanted to go home. Then Sunday, I just wanted to get on the plane and go back to Florida.”McIlroy duly opened up on the specifics of his driver. “I was a little pissed off because I knew that Scottie’s driver had failed on Monday but my name was the one that was leaked. It was supposed to stay confidential. Two members of the media were the ones that leaked it.“I didn’t want to get up there and say something I regretted. I’m trying to protect Scottie. I don’t want to mention his name. I’m trying to protect TaylorMade. I’m trying to protect the USGA, PGA of America, myself.“With Scottie’s stuff, that’s not my information to share. I felt that process is supposed to be kept confidential and it wasn’t for whatever reason. That’s why I was pretty annoyed at that.”View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler won the US PGA despite his driver failing a test before the championship.Photograph: Jared C Tilton/Getty ImagesLost in this melee was that McIlroy’s driving accuracy statistics were decidedly poor at Augusta National and the month previously, whenhe won the Players Championship. His appearance in Canada serves in part as a buildup for the US Open at Oakmont next week and he admitted he has had to juggle fresh thoughts after winning the Masters, a success that completed the career grand slam.“I would certainly say that the last few weeks, I’ve had a couple of weeks off and going and grinding on the range for three or four hours every day is maybe a little tougher than it used to be,” the 36-year-old said. “You have this event in your life that you’ve worked towards and it happens, sometimes it’s hard to find the motivation to get back on the horse and go again.“The last two weeks have been good for me just as a reset, just to figure out where I’m at in my own head, what I want to do, where I want to play. I thought it was a good time to reset some goals. I’ve had a pretty good first half of the season and I want to have a good second half of the season now, too.”Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyGolfUS sportsScottie SchefflerUS PGAnewsShareReuse this content"

As Willie Carson, four times a winner of the Classic and on hand to draw the stall numbers, pointed out during the rehearsal, the FA’s crest was still obvious on the bag.FA Cup balls are ready for a wide-open Derby with no obvious winnerRead moreBut if a little borrowing from elsewhere can help to rebuild the Derby’s popularity and status, both locally and further afield, then Jim Allen, Epsom’s new general manager, will ask away. “I came here [to the local Picturehouse] to watch a movie a few months ago, and I thought it would be an ideal venue for the draw,” Allen said on Wednesday. “I called a friend of mine at the FA to ask if there was any chance we could use their equipment, and within 45 minutes, they said: ‘Yes.’“We tried to get a set of starting stalls into town as well, which everybody was on board for, but it was the size of them, we just really couldn’t quite fit them in, so we’re looking at that for next year.”Allen never missed a Derby when he was growing up in nearby Croydon – “it was the one day all year when I missed school” – but nearly a quarter of a century working in a variety of roles, including director of racing at Arena Racing Company from 2006 to 2015 and a spell training horses in the US and France, has kept him away from Epsom on the big day since the turn of the century.View image in fullscreenThe official draw for Saturday’s Derby took place at Epsom Picturehouse with the former winning jockeys Martin Dwyer (left) and Willie Carson and other special guests.Photograph: Racing TVHe has thought of little else since his appointment last October, however, and this year the Classic meeting, which opens with the Oaks and Coronation Cup card on Friday, will be his first chance to put a stamp on the event, and tempt racegoers back to an occasion that has seen attendances decline steadily. The 2004 Derby drew 48,000 spectators, but 10 years later the figure had dropped to 34,000 and last year it was just under 27,000.“It’s my job to try to bring some of those crowds back,” Allen says. “It will take a while to learn about Epsom, it’s quite a complicated racecourse with its temporary-structure build, but basically we’ll review everything, including the marketing, the promotion, and the temporary structures, and at the heart of it will be the race. I’d like to build everything around the race.”One of Allen’s models for the Derby’s future will be Louisville, Kentucky, where he has seen first-hand how the buildup to the Kentucky Derby takes over the city in the days before.“We’d love to get it to that level,” he says. “It’ll take a bit of time but there’s no reason why we can’t. Epsom is a fantastic town and there are venues here to do all sorts of different things.

And that’s what they did.”Kellogg also repeated rumours that Ukraine had struck the Russian nuclear fleet at Severomorsk, although reports of an explosion there have not been confirmed. He said the US was “trying to avoid” an escalation.Other current and former members of the administration skeptical of US support for Ukraine have also vocally opposed the drone strikes.“It is not in America’s interest for Ukraine to be attacking Russia’s strategic nuclear forces the day before another round of peace talks,” said Dan Caldwell, an influential foreign policy adviser who was a senior aide to Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon until he was purged amid a leaking scandal last month.“This has the potential to be highly escalatory and raises the risk of direct confrontation between Russia and Nato,” he said. “US should not only distance itself from this attack but end any support that could directly or indirectly enable attacks against Russian strategic nuclear forces.”It is not the first time that concerns over Russia’s use of a nuclear weapon have been used to try to temper US support for Ukraine.As Moscow’s forces were routed near Kharkiv and in the south at Kherson in September 2022, Russian officials sent signals that the Kremlin was considering using a battlefield nuclear weapon, senior Biden officials have said.National security officials said they believed that if the Russian lines collapsed and left open the potential for a Ukrainian attack on Crimea, then there was a 50% chance that Russia would use a nuclear weapon as a result.Ukrainian officials have responded by saying that Russia has embellished its threats of a nuclear attack in order to blackmail the US from giving greater support to Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaNuclear weaponsEuropeUS foreign policyDonald TrumpVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s divide and conquer.”Hegseth orders US navy to strip Harvey Milk name from ship amid Pride monthRead morePenn, who won his second best actor Oscar for playing the former San Francisco supervisor, added in an email: “I’ve never before seen a Secretary of Defense so aggressively demote himself to the rank of Chief PETTY Officer.”The order to rename the USNS HarveyMilk, christened in San Diego in 2021 for the prominent gay rights and navy veteran, was part of an internal memo that was leaked on Tuesday. The Pentagon’s chief spokesperson confirmed that the ship’s new name “will be announced after internal reviews are complete”.The timing of the decision for mid-June, a month meant to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community, was reportedly intentional. The renaming is supposed to ensure “alignment with president and SECDEF objectives and SECNAV priorities of reestablishing the warrior culture”, referring to Donald Trump, Hegseth and navy secretary John Phelan, according to the memorandum.“Secretary Hegseth is committed to ensuring that the names attached to all DOD installations and assets are reflective of the commander in chief’s priorities, our nation’s history and the warrior ethos,” the Pentagon said in a statement.LGBTQ+ leaders condemn Trump plan to drop Harvey Milk’s name from navy shipRead more“These guys are idiots,” Black told the Hollywood Reporter. “Pete Hegseth does not seem like a smart man, a wise man, a knowledgeable man. He seems small and petty. I would love to introduce him to some LGBTQ folks who are warriors who have had to be warriors our entire life just to live our lives openly as who we are.”Milk, written by Black and directed by Gus Van Sant, depicted Milk’s political ascendancy in San Francisco, where he became the first publicly gay man to be elected to public office when he won a seat on the city’s board of supervisors. He was assassinated along with mayor George Moscone by former city supervisor Dan White in 1978. White was convicted on two counts of voluntary manslaughter and served just five years in prison.The USNS Harvey Milk was initially named in 2016 during the administration ofBarack Obama. According to the leaked memo, Phelan is also considering new titles for vessels named after such civil rights icons as Thurgood Marshall, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Harriet Tubman and Cesar Chavez.“Harvey Milk is an icon, a civil rights icon, and for good reason,” Black said. “That’s not going to change. Renaming a ship isn’t going to change that. If people are pissed off, good, be pissed off – but take the appropriate action. Do what Harvey Milk had said we need to do, and it’s about bringing back together the coalition of the ‘us’-es that helps move the pendulum of progress forward. Stop the infighting and lock arms again. That’s what Harvey would say.”Explore more on these topicsSean PennMilkPete HegsethLGBTQ+ rightsTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was understood to be enthusiastic and supportive of the name change.Adopting the birth name of his mother, Diana, would probably have further deepened therift between the Harry and the royal family, which shows no signs of being healed.However, the discussion became moot because the UK passports for Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet were finally issued almost six months after the initial applications – days after lawyers for the Sussexes sent a letter threatening to pursue a data subject access request.This could have revealed details of the delays – and the nature of any behind-the-scenes discussions between British officials responsible for issuing the documents.One source told the Guardian that the duke and duchess had feared that UK officials were dragging their feet because the passport applications included the titles HRH (His/Her Royal Highness) for both children.The applications also used the surname Sussex, which the family had already started using publicly; until 2023, Archie had US and British passports under the name Mountbatten-Windsor.“There was clear reluctance to issue passports for the kids,” a source close to the Sussexes said.The standard wait time for a passport is three weeks. But after three months without receiving them because of “technical issues”, it is understood Harry and Meghan reapplied using the 24-hour passport service, only to have their meeting cancelled at the last minute owing to a “systems failure.”Forgive and forget? Both sides must be accountable after a family falloutRead moreThe source claimed that “the king hadn’t wanted Archie and Lili to carry the titles, most of all the HRH, and the British passports, once created, would be the first and perhaps the only legal proof of their names”.The source added: “Harry was at a point where British passports for his children with their updated Sussex surnames (since the death of Queen Elizabeth II) were being blocked with a string of excuses over the course of five months.“Out of sheer exasperation he went to his uncle to effectively say: ‘My family are supposed to have the same name and they’re stopping that from happening because the kids are legally HRH, so if push comes to shove, if this blows up and they won’t let the kids be called Sussex, then can we use Spencer as a surname?’”The Guardian understands that Prince Harry wants to keep the HRH titles for his children so that when they grow older they can decide for themselves whether they want to become working royals, or stay out of public life.He and Meghan dropped the honorific in 2020 as part of thearrangementagreed with Queen Elizabeth II when they stopped performing royal duties.The couple are believed to have been angered by a report in the Mail on Sunday earlier this week, which claimed Earl Spencer had advised Harry not to change his name, saying the legal hurdles were insurmountable. “It’s completely untrue,” a source said.The Guardian put a series of questions to theHome Officeand Buckingham Palace about the delays to the passport applications, and asked whether officials processing the documents had been seeking or taking advice from them.The Home Office said it was its longstanding policy not to comment on individual cases.Buckingham Palace made clear it would not be commenting on any personal matters relating to members of the royal family. But it denied making any suggestions or objections to the passports being issued with HRH in the titles.A spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex said: “We do not comment on private issues pertaining to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s children.”Earl Spencer was also approached but he had not responded at the time of publication.In May,Harry lost a legal challengeover the level of taxpayer-funded security he is entitled to while in the UK, but it is understood he intends to challenge the ruling.He had challenged the dismissal of his high court claim against the Home Office over the decision of the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures, known as Ravec, that he should receive a different degree of protection when in the country after he stepped down.The prince considers that his mother, Diana, might still be alive if she had continued to have the security protection offered to other royals.However, three senior judges at the court of appeal rejected Harry’s claim that he had been “singled out” for “inferior treatment” and that his safety and life were “at stake” after a change in security arrangements that occurred when he stepped down as a working royal and moved abroad.Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryMeghan, the Duchess of SussexDiana, Princess of WalesHome OfficePassport OfficeMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

She told the court that in an effort to “act casual” she went to the apartment’s balcony.Ex-assistant who alleged Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs raped her returns to stand: ‘The lows were low’Read moreCombs then entered the apartment, she said, telling the court that he thencame up to her from behind ,lifted her up, and placed her on top of the balcony’s rail.Bongolan testified that Combs then told her several times, “you know what the fuck you did” but said that she was not aware what he was referring to.“For a split second I was thinking about if I was going to fall, but for the most part he was yelling at me, so I was trying to answer him,” Bongolan, 33, told the jury.She alleged that Combs held her on top of the balcony’s rail for around 10 to 15 seconds, before pulling her down and throwing her onto the balcony furniture.At the time, Bongolan said that she was about 5ft 1in (155cm) tall and weighed between 100 and 115lbs (45 to 52 kg). Combs, Bongolan said, was “bigger”.In court on Wednesday, jurors were shown photos Bongolan took that day which depicted bruises she said she suffered as a result of the incident, as well as her wearing a neck brace.Bongolan testified that the incident left her with nightmares and paranoia. “I used to scream a lot in my sleep,” she said.During cross-examination, Combs’s lawyer challenged Bongolan’s credibility, and questioned discrepancies in her accounts of the alleged incident.Combs, 55, faces federal charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution.Arrested in September 2024, Combs has pleaded not guilty to all five counts.Federal prosecutors in Manhattan say Combs over two decades coerced women, including Ventura, to take part in drug-fueled sexual performances with male sex workers known as “freak-offs”.The trial is in its fourth week.Ventura, an R&B singer known as Cassie, told jurors last month that shewas coercedandblackmailedinto participating in the drug-fueled sex sessions she said were orchestrated and directed by Combs, known as “freak-offs” and detailed thephysical and emotional abuse she says she enduredfrom Combs during their relationship.During cross-examination of Ventura, Combs’s lawyers sought to portray her as a consenting participant in the “freak-offs” and argued that the sexual encounters were part of a“swingers lifestyle”.Second woman testifies that Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sexually assaulted herRead moreProsecutors with the Manhattan US attorney’s office say Combs and his associates used force and the threat of force to coerce women to take part in the freak-offs and to make sure witnesses to his abuse remained quiet.Combs’s lawyers have acknowledged Combs’s history of domestic violence,but argue that women who took part in freak-offs did so consensually. His lawyers have argued that he isnot guilty of sex trafficking or racketeering, and denied any criminal enterprise.On Wednesday, Bongolan also told the jury thatCombs and Ventura often had a volatile relationship. Bongolan said she saw Ventura with a black eye or bruises on multiple occasions. Once, Bongolan said she saw Combs throw a knife in Ventura’s direction at Ventura’s apartment.Another time, on the beach in Malibu, California, Combs approached Bongolan and said: “I’m the devil and I could kill you,” Bongolan testified. She said she did not know why Combs told her that.Testimony is due to resume on Thursday morning, and Bongolan is expected to return to the stand for more cross examination.If convicted on all counts, Combs could face up to life in prison.Prosecutors have said they may finish presenting their case next week, allowing the defense to put on its case.Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reporting.In the US, thedomestic violence hotlineis 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

The manuscripts range from legal documents to parts of the Hebrew Bible, and are thought to date from around the third century BCE to the second century CE.Now researchers have used artificial intelligence to glean fresh insights into the dates of individual scrolls – findings experts suggest could challenge ideas about when, where and by whom they were produced.“It’s like a time machine. So we can shake hands with these people from 2,000 years ago, and we can put them in time much better now, said Prof Mladen Popović, first author of the research from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.While some scrolls were radiocarbon dated in the 1990s, Popović said scholars did not tackle the problem of castor oil contamination – a substance applied in the 1950s to help experts read the manuscripts, but which could skew results.In addition, many of the scrolls had only been dated by handwriting analysis.Writing in the journal Plos One, the team report how they attempted radiocarbon dating of 30 samples from different manuscripts found at four sites and thought to span five centuries. Crucially, the team first cleaned the samples to remove the castor oil contamination.The researchers successfully radiocarbon-dated 27 samples, finding that while two were younger than handwriting analysis had suggested, many were older.Among other findings, the researchers discovered two different writing styles, known as Hasmonean and Herodian scripts, coexisted for a much longer period than previously thought, while a sample from a manuscript called 4Q114 – which contains verses from the book of Daniel – was older than traditional palaeography had suggested.“It was previously dated to the late second century BCE, a generation after the author of the Book of Daniel. Now, with our study we move back in time contemporary to that author,” said Popović.The team then used a type of AI known as machine learning to build a model they called Enoch – a nod to a biblical figure associated with scientific knowledge.The team trained Enoch by feeding it 62 digital images of ink traces from 24 of the radiocarbon dated manuscripts, together with the carbon-14 dates.They then verified the model by showing Enoch a further 13 images from the same manuscripts. In 85% of cases the model produced ages that tallied with the radiocarbon dates, and in many cases produced a smaller range of probable dates than obtained from radiocarbon dating alone.“What we have created is a very robust tool that is empirically based – based on physics and on geometry,” said Popović.When Enoch was presented with images from 135 undated manuscripts it had not previously seen, it realistically dated 79% of them – as judged by expert palaeographers. Popović added those deemed unrealistic might have had problematic data, such as poor quality images.The system has already produced new insights including that a copy of the biblical book Ecclesiastes dates from the time of the book’s presumed author.Popović said Enoch meant the age of further scrolls could now be uncovered without radiocarbon dating – a process that requires the destruction of small samples.“There are more than 1,000 Dead Sea scrolls manuscripts so our study is a first but significant step, opening a door unto history with new possibilities for research,” he said.Prof emerita Joan Taylor of King’s College London, said the results would have a major impact on Qumran studies.“These results mean that most of the manuscripts found in the caves near Qumran would not have been written at the site of Qumran, which was not occupied until later,” she said.However, Dr Matthew Collins of the University of Chester cautioned that radiocarbon dating only shed light on the age of the parchment, not when it was written on, while there were also questions about how stylistically representative the small number of training samples were for different periods in time.“Overall, this is an important and welcome study, and one which may provide us with a significant new tool in our armoury for dating these texts,” he said. “Nevertheless, it’s one that we should adopt with caution, and in careful conjunction with other evidence.”Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyReligionMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I urge us all to call for a further legal opinion from the OEP so that misleading ministerial statements aren’t allowed to stay in circulation for too long.”The Guardianrevealed on Tuesdaythat three separate legal opinions – including the OEP’s – say the bill rolls back environmental protections, including for more than 5,000 of the most sensitive, rare and protected habitats in England, leaving them vulnerable to destruction. Wildlife charities are calling on the government to scrap part three and redraw the bill when it returns to parliament on Monday.Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the RSPB, said: “The government must stop portraying this planning bill as a win-win for nature and economic growth. It is not. A thriving natural world is essential to underpin both growth and a resilient future. It’s not too late for the government to address the issues with part three of the bill, and put forward legislation that can actually deliver economic growth and restore nature at scale.”Property developers have yet to build 1.4m homes for which they have planning permission. In a tactic known as landbanking, developers hold land with planning permission to secure higher values, according to recent research by theInstitute for Public Policy Research(IPPR).Chris Hinchliff, the Labour MP for North East Hertfordshire, said that rather than pushing through a bill that allowed developers to pay to sidestep environmental protections, ministers should force developers to start building the homes they already had permission for.Hinchliff hassubmitted a number of amendmentsto the bill aiming to strengthen protections for nature. He said: “This legislation strips back environmental protections and local democracy but does nothing to stop developers drip-feeding developments to inflate prices. The planning system consistently approves more homes than get built. The bottleneck isn’t simply process, it’s profit.”The rebel backbenchers are working with the Green party and the Liberal Democrats to form a large group that hopes to scupper part three of the bill, which they say is the most damaging, when the legislation comes to parliament next week.Part three allows developers to sidestep environmental obligations by paying into a nature restoration fund, for environmental improvements elsewhere at a later date.Destroying our natural wealth makes us poorer in every sense of the wordRead moreThe planning and infrastructure bill is central to the government’s growth strategy, with a target to build 1.5m homes by the end of this parliament to address the UK’shousing affordability crisisand drive economic growth.Ministersannounced recentlythat they were consulting on a range of measures to get developers building, including considering a use-it-or-lose-it policy, which was recommended by the IPPR in its report in February.IPPR research shows that planning rules have been loosened over the past two decades but building rates have decreased during that time.Hinchliff said there should a fresh approach to deal with underperforming developers. “I’ve proposed financial penalties for developers who don’t build as promised, and new powers for councils to block developments from firms which repeatedly land bank,” he said.Terry Jermy, the Labour MP for South West Norfolk, said: “Ensuring that homes with planning permission get built in a timely manner is part of the solution to our housing needs. There’s a housing shortage in the country, which is costing local councils and the government huge sums of money in emergency and temporary accommodation, and the dream of home ownership remains out of reach for many. Tackling landbanking needs to form part of the government’s focus to bring about the change needed.”Dr Maya Singer Hobbs, a senior research fellow at IPPR, said: “Developers are not deliberately building slowly to stymie housebuilding, but they are not going to build at a rate that will reduce house prices – it’s not in their interest to do this, and indeed they have legal obligations to shareholders that would prevent this. There might be a case to explore whether giving local authorities the power to apply a ‘use it or lose it’ approach to planning permission would speed up delivery.”Explore more on these topicsPlanning policyLabourGreen politicsHousingReal estatenewsShareReuse this content"

So when their clear, pure voices rang out from some brambles in Kent on a late spring morning, it felt as if they were campaigning for their home.Their music has charmed writers from Keats to Oscar Wilde. But over the decades, the little brown bird has had its habitat gradually hacked away because the thick brambles it likes to nest in have little use for humans.Birdsong at Lodge HillA nightingale can be made out amidst the busy singingSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2025/05/30-62824-New+Recording+8.mp300:00:0000:00:01And now one of its most important strongholds is under threat from the Labour government’splanning and infrastructure bill. For the best part of a decade, developers have been eying up Lodge Hill in Kent, where more than 100 singing birds are known to live. The derelict army training camp, which is mostly off-limits to the public though there is a footpath through some of the woodland, is prime brownfield, a 10-minute drive from Strood, which is on the high-speed line to London.Revealed: 5,000 English nature sites at risk under Labour’s planning proposalsRead moreIn 2017,Medway council proposed 5,000 homesfor the area, but the plan was shelved after a survey showed that there were 85 singing birds in the bushes. Since the RSPB’s efforts at protecting the site, there are now more than 100. Shortly after this, however, Homes England, a government body, proposed 2,000 homes, then 500.For now, the plans are to build just a few homes on the outskirts of the reserve, rather than on it. That is thanks to a designation (granted afteryears of campaigning by the RSPB) as a site of special scientific interest by Natural England, meaning that the habitat cannot be destroyed.But if Labour’s planning bill is passed in its current form, that protection will vanish; developers will be able to pay to create nature somewhere else in the country to gain permission to build here.View image in fullscreenThe bushes in Lodge Hill attract nightingales because they contain a variety of habitats.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianAnd that will be a catastrophe for the nightingales. “Developers say they can just create some more habitat elsewhere, but that really doesn’t work for nightingales,” Joseph Beale, an RSPB conservation officer and nightingale expert, says: “They won’t move somewhere else, they’ll just go, we will lose them. Nightingales only tend to set up home when they hear others of their species sing. So they’ll fly over, and hear another nightingale sing, and know that means the area is good for nightingales. If this area falls silent, it will stop being used by them, and they won’t just set up somewhere new. This is a special area – nature has chosen it – let’s just protect it.”A map showing the location of Lodge Hill‘Half the tree of life’: ecologists’ horror as nature reserves are emptied of insectsRead moreThere are thought to be just 5,500 or so breeding pairs still in the UK, a dramatic decrease of more than 90% in the last 50 years.This grove is uniquely attractive to the birds because of its use by the Ministry of Defence, which means the woodland has been disturbed by heavy machinery and even explosions, leading to a variety of habitats which are heaven for songbirds. Thick brambles give way to ancient woodland and rare grassland, providing nesting and hunting sites as well as tall trees to sing from.“They like scrub. They like thickets,” Beale says. “Unfortunately, a lot of that seems to grow up on land that’s been left a little while, like brownfield and formerly developed land, and this is exactly what developers like. So they often fall through the cracks of planning, because they live in this sort of habitat that’s a little bit undervalued.”When the Guardian joined the RSPB for a walk around the site, the air was thick with birdsong; immediately identifiable were chiffchaffs, blackcaps, woodpeckers, chaffinches and scores of baby blue tits. In the long tunnel of trees and hedges, walking down the footpath felt like being in a high-rise city of songbirds.View image in fullscreenThe fact that Lodge Hill has been disturbed by the Ministry of Defence suits the nightingale.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianAnd – amazingly – we heard four nightingales. Their complex song cuts through all the rest, their voices are so strong and unwavering. “It’s like all the birdsong in the world condensed into one sound,” says Beale. He has heard the bird hundreds of times, but is just as starstruck on each occasion.The nightingale was once common acrossEngland, before its homes were demolished. These days, its meagre population has been squeezed into south-east England, unfortunately, the area with the biggest housing pressure. If the bill is passed, the protection of being a Site of Special Scientific Interest will be meaningless.Dawn chorus at Lodge HillThe cry of a tawny owl in the woods capturedSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/06/04/New_Recording.mp300:00:0000:00:00“It essentially undermines that pretty fundamental environmental principle that you should try and avoid the most precious sites first,” Beale says. “At the moment even before this law is passed, we’re fighting to stand still. You know, we’re not even saying, can we have more protections? We’re trying to save what we already have, which is the remnants of what we used to have. So we are really worried.”Of the suggestion Keir Starmer should come and hear the nightingales, Beale says: “It would probably do him some good.”Birdsong recorded by photographer Martin GodwinExplore more on these topicsBirdsPlanning policyLabourAnimalsWildlifeEnglandHousingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Current guidelines prevent French border police intervening offshore except to rescue people.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAImmigration and asylumFrance plans to begin intercepting small boats at sea, says UK Home OfficeOfficials have agreed to begin offshore interceptions, it is claimed, in change of policy that NGOs say will risk livesRajeev SyalHome affairs editorWed 4 Jun 2025 14.32 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 15.24 EDTShareThe French government plans to begin intercepting small boats carrying asylum seekers even if they are already at sea, aHome Officesource has said.In a move that NGOs claim will endanger lives, it was claimed that French officials agreed this week to draw up plans to begin intervening in waters close to beaches and inland canals.A Home Office source said the plan was intended to clamp down on boats that “taxi” up to French beaches from nearby waterways. “The French have said this week they will intervene to tackle the taxi boats which are operating inland and near to French beaches to help prevent these dangerous crossings,” the source said.Keir Starmer is attempting to fight off a growing challenge from Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, andLabourparty officials are convinced that rising irregular immigration numbers will be a key issue in future elections.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, expressed her concern on Monday that French officials were not intercepting boats at sea “as swiftly as possible” after a record 1,195 people reached the UK in 19 small boats on Saturday. It took the total number of such arrivals so far this year to 14,812, the highest on record.It was reported that French officials stopped fewer than 200 people from making the journey, but Home Office sources said French authorities had intervened to stop nearly 500 people trying to get into small boats on that day. There was footage of a gendarmes looking on from the beach as people attempting to reach the UK ran into the water and climbed onboard small boats.Current guidelines prevent French police from intervening offshore unless it is to rescue passengers in distress. In practice, the policy means officers can stop boats leaving the beach by puncturing them, but are restricted once they are in the water.In February, Bruno Retailleau, the French interior minister, said he wanted a change to the rules to enable officers to intervene in the water up to 300 metres from the coast. “We have to review our organisation so that we can board these boats … arriving to pick up migrants,” he said.Le Figaro newspaper reported earlier this year that ministry officials were still working on what were being termed the “feet in the water” guidelines to implement the policy. However, the French maritime daily newspaper Le Marin said the proposed change of rules had been opposed by local police officers.Cooper has said she wants French border police to intercept the taxi boats not only in the shallow waters as they leave the beaches but also when they make their way from rivers and inland waterways to pick up people on the beach. With heatwaves forecast this summer, there are concerns still larger numbers of people will attempt the perilous crossing.Traffickers have circumvented rules by asking asylum seekers to wade waist-high into the Channel, where they are picked up by dinghies that were launched from inland canals.French government sourcestold the Telegraphon Wednesday that ministers overseeing migration policy had given the green light to stopping boats in the water while respecting the law of the sea.It is understood that the French authorities have said they will draw up plans to intercept boats in shallow waters within weeks.Cooper is also planning a new law to fast-track the removal of asylum seekers who arrivefrom countries deemed to be safe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionA Home Office analysis released on Wednesday morning claimed that the record numbers of people arriving in the UK via small boats could be attributed to favourable weather and greater numbers being crammed into vessels. Figures show there were twice as many “red days” – when there are calmer conditions in the Channel, meaning crossings are more likely – in the first four months of this year as there were in the same period in 2024.In the year to April, 47% of boats crossing the Channel had 60 or more people onboard, compared with 2% in the year to April 2022.The Migration Observatory at Oxford University challenged the Home Office analysis, saying there was no evidence that weather was a major factor in long-term increases in arrivals.Priti Patel, then Tory home secretary, attempted to draw up plans for UK and French officers to intervene at sea in 2021, but her French counterpart said thatFrancewould not accept any practices contrary to the law of the sea. The plans were eventually shelved.Responding to the latest plans, Steve Smith, the chief executive of Care4Calais, said the plan would cost more lives at sea as gangs and asylum seekers took greater risks to reach the UK.“Last year saw a record number of refugees lose their lives on our border, and still our political leaders risk more deaths rather than create safe routes to claim asylum,” he said.“Interceptions in the sea, like the last Tory government’s failed attempt to implement pushbacks, have never been tried because they put lives at risk, and are most likely illegal. Like all the other so-called deterrents, and failed security initiatives, this is doomed to fail, but it will cost lives along the way.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

However, as this review highlights, professionals must always be mindful of whether their views about parents, including their faith, race and culture, [are] inhibiting their capacity to be questioning and act together in a timely way to safeguard and protect children.”Tai, 42, a medical genetics graduate, and Naiyahmi, 43, a former shop worker, left the body buried in the garden when they were evicted from the house in 2022. The couple adopted their own belief and legal system known as “slick law”, which incorporated elements of Igbo culture.They were described as shunning society, putting a sign on the door of their home that warned “all governmental and non-governmental bodies” not to ring the doorbell or make “any contact with any member of this house”.Tai and Naiyahmi, who were arrested in December 2022 while living in a shipping container in Somerset, were sentenced to 24 years and six months and 19 years and six months for multiple charges including child cruelty, causing or allowing the death of a child, and attempting to pervert the course of justice.Explore more on these topicsChildrenBirminghamnewsShareReuse this content"

Space for new tissue is then created by inflating the balloon, which supports the heart valve.The HumberHealthCare Partnership, which runs Castle Hill through Hull university teaching hospitals NHS trust (HUTH), told the BBC that three separate reviews, conducted after concerns were raised, had found that deaths after this type of surgery at the hospital were in line with the national average.It said families who had lost loved ones were invited to ask questions and that the trust was “happy to answer those directly”.The spokesperson said: “Three separate external reviews of our TAVI service have been undertaken and shown that mortality rates associated with TAVI are similar to national mortality rates over a four-year period.“The Royal College of Physicians was invited to review the service in 2021, at the request of the trust’s chief medical officer. The Royal College report concluded that the TAVI service is essential for the Humber and North Yorkshire region and needs to be expanded.“It stated, however, that the design of the service should be reviewed and invested in. The report offered a number of actions for improvement and we have delivered against all of those since it was shared with us.”A Humberside police spokesperson said: “An investigation is in the very early stages in relation to deaths following surgery at Castle Hill hospital. Inquiries are being carried out and at this time, we can confirm no arrests have been made.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHospitalsHealthYorkshireHullEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

London’s unit is the biggest, with the capital also suffering the highest rate of knife crime.The scheme includes support based at hospital emergency departments aimed to stop retaliation from victims of violence, as well as services in police custody suites that have tried to help 800 children.The report details what drives violent crime and how a public health approach can help reduce it.It says: “Monitoring data shows that nearly three-quarters of young people in hospital following a stabbing or violent incident reduced their risk of harm after the intervention from a youth worker.“And last year, data reported by our projects showed that almost 90% of teenagers arrested for violent offences did not reoffend over the next 12 months following intervention and help from a youth worker based in the busiest police stations in London.”The scheme is showing signs of being able to exploit the “teachable moment” long talked about by police and youth workers. It is the point where someone is wavering between continuing as a criminal or turning their back on violence.Michael Gosling, one of the London youth workers based in police custody, said he tried to earn childrens’ trust and told them not to discuss their crimes with him, with most wanting to talk about what had led to them being under arrest.“Going into custody can be quite scary,” he said. “I try to appeal to them by using body language. I tell them I am there for them, I am not there to judge them. We are not wearing the get-up of a police officer. I make it clear I am not a police officer.”VRUs, and the expansion of youth work they involve, represent an attempt to counter attitudes supporting violence. Gosling said of one case: “He was a product of his environment.”Some youngsters were driven by needing money to eat, others by buying trainers or just exploiting “the playground of opportunities”, Gosling said. “Older gang members are looking for younger children who are vulnerable, to recruit them,” he added.Gosling said otherssaw violence as a necessary part of their attempt to make money: “The thought process is: here and now. They are out to get it by any means necessary.”The report says low trust in theMetropolitan policedamages the fight against crime: “Trust and confidence in policing have seen sustained declines over recent years – just 46 percent of Londoners believe the police do a good job in their local area. This is 10 percent below where it was 5 years ago.”One young person mentioned reportedly described their reluctance to report a crime to the police, “saying they weren’t sure if they would be treated as a victim or perpetrator. They described feeling ‘powerless’”.Peck said: “I don’t think you can get away from the fact that it’s a very problematic relationship at times. We just see the consequences of it.”The VRU also claims success reducing school exclusions, and says children not in education are more likely to become involved in violence. Peck said: “Whatever the cost to the taxpayer [of the VRU] we are saving the same or saving more.”Since the VRU started in 2019, homicide rates are down in the capital. Its murder rate is now lower than Paris, Toronto, Manchester and Berlin, but higher than Rome and the West Midlands.Other crime types are increasing, however, and London’s VRU, largely funded by the mayor, is seen as a long-term project for a decade or more.Key factors driving violence remainpoverty,deprivationand alienation, with drugs a key factor – 56% of homicides between 2012-13 and 2017-18 in London were drug-related, according to the report.There has also been an increase in the proportion of 10- to 14-year-olds suspected of violence.Explore more on these topicsPoliceYoung peoplePrisons and probationUK criminal justiceCrimeKnife crimeLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

One politician, Marian Hussein, was asked by the speaker to remove her keffiyeh, which she kept on in protest. During the debate, sounds of shouting protesters outside echoed in the chamber.Hussein, the deputy leader of the Socialist Left party, which brought forward one of the proposals, said in response: “Speaker, I will not take off my Palestinian scarf. Those standing outside are shouting right now: ‘Stop Norwegian involvement, withdraw the oil fund.’”She added: “Why do we still show double standards in this hall? Why are some people worth less than others?”After quoting from a famous Norwegian poem, Du Må Ikke Sove (Dare Not Sleep) from 1936, she cited Jens Stoltenberg, the former Nato secretary general who is now the finance minister in Norway’s minority Labour government.View image in fullscreenA protester is removed from outside parliament where pro-Palestinian crowds had gathered on 4 June.Photograph: Reuters“We are a small nation which constantly talks about the need for a world order,” she said. “We have a finance minister who has been a former Nato chief and prime minister. He knows very well what this means in foreign policy.”During the debate, Stoltenberg said Norway had “an established ethical regime for the fund”. He added: “We divest from the companies that contribute to Israel’s breach of international law, but we do not divest from all companies that are present on the ground.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This should have been the easiest vote of our lives, especially for the Labour party and the Labour government.”She added: “We are not backing down. Shortly before the government recognised the state of Palestine, they voted against it in parliament. We will continue to put pressure on the other parties together with the massive movement in civil society.”Before the afternoon vote, crowds gathered outside parliament for a protest organised by several organisations including the Palestinian Committee, the Action Group for Palestine and Amnesty International Norway.Norway has played a historical role in the region, including by facilitating the Oslo peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians that led to a breakthrough deal in 1993. Last year itrecognised the Palestinian state, one of a minority of European countries to do so.Last week, Norway’s international development minister, Åsmund Aukrust, told the Guardian that Israel wassetting a dangerous precedentfor international human rights law violations in Gaza that was making the world more dangerous.Line Khateeb, the leader of the Palestine Committee of Norway, said the vote was an opportunity for politicians “to show that international law matters and that they do not want to make Norway complicit in the Israeli genocide and colonisation”.View image in fullscreenProtesters waving Palestinian flags outside Norway’s central bank in March.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesStoltenberg, she said, “needs to take responsibility” and she called on the oil fund to divest from Israel as it had done from all Russian companies immediately after the invasion of Ukraine. She added: “Even though the Norwegian oil fund is Europe’s largest investor in the Israeli occupation, Stoltenberg claims that the current guidelines are good enough. That is appalling and needs to change.”The discovery of one of the world’s largest offshore oilfields off the Norwegian coast in 1969 and the huge revenue that came from selling it dramatically changed Norway’s prospects, bringing rapid economic growth.Norway’s oil fund, officially called the Government Pension Fund Global, was established in 1990 to preserve revenues for future generations in the knowledge that the oil supply will one day run out. The first deposit was made to the fund in 1996 and since then it has been invested only outside Norway.Explore more on these topicsNorwayPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaEuropeWest BankGazaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The stadium has a capacity of only 35,000 people, but 200,000 to 300,000 people came,” he said.“At a time of celebration, this unfortunate event should not have happened. We are saddened by this. The fans that showed up were beyond our expectations.”One police officer carried an injured spectator to an ambulance, while people gathered around another lying seemingly unconscious on the ground.Mithun Singh, a software engineer in the crowd, claimed that police started caning people at one gate, leading to more chaos.Naseer Ahmed, a political secretary for the Karnataka chief minister, told the broadcaster NDTV the crowd became uncontrollable and authorities were unable to make proper arrangements.Bengaluru were celebrating beating Punjab Kings on Tuesday in the T20 tournament’s final match in the 18th edition of theIPL, the world’s richest cricket league.In January, at least 30 people were killed as tens of thousands of Hindus rushed to bathe in a sacred river during the Maha Kumbh Mela festival, the world’s largest religious gathering.Explore more on these topicsIndiaIPLCricketSouth and central AsiaTwenty20ShareReuse this content"

It featured the testimony of several women who claim they were sexually assaulted by Simmons in the 1980s and 90s, when he was at the height of his influence as the co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, the hip-hop label behind LL Cool J,Public Enemy, the Beastie Boys and other top acts.Simmons has consistently denied all allegations. He seeks $20m for defamation, alleging the film-makers “disregard[ed] and/or suppressed” information provided by his representatives, according to a summons filed in Manhattan court on Tuesday by Simmons’ lawyer, Imran Ansari.‘People continue to turn a blind eye’: behind a shocking film about music industry abuseRead more“Despite voluminous support for Mr Simmons in the form of credible information, persuasive evidence, witness statements, and calls for further investigation by notable members of the media, politics, and the civil rights movement, the defendants simply disregarded it, and released, and continue to re-release globally, a film that tremendously disparaged and damaged Mr Simmons with salacious and defamatory accusations that he vehemently denies,” Ansari and co-counsel Carla DiMare said in a statement.The suit comes after the statute of limitations for defamation in New York passed, which is one year from the date of first publication. To prevail, Simmons and his legal team will have to demonstrate thatHBOis liable for “republication” in international markets.On Wednesday, HBO’s parent company, Warner Bros Discovery, dismissed the lawsuit’s allegations as “unfounded”.“We dispute Mr Simmons’ allegations, stand by the film-makers and their process, and will vigorously defend ourselves against these unfounded allegations,” a company spokesperson toldDeadline.On the Record premiered to strong reviews at the Sundance film festival in January 2020. The film was initially supposed to stream on Apple TV+ as part of producer Oprah Winfrey’s deal with the company, but ended up at HBO Max that May after Winfrey abruptly withdrew her support ahead of the film’s premiere, citing unspecified “inconsistencies”. (Though no longer affiliated with the film, Winfrey continued to publicly support its subjects – “I stand with the women, I support the women, and I do hope that people see the film,” shetold CBSthat January.)On the Record: the music industry #MeToo doc that caused Oprah to turn awayRead moreWinfrey’s shock withdrawal from the project “blinded” the film-makers, who maintained that she was incorrect. “There are no inconsistencies,” Dicktoldthe Guardian in May 2020. “These stories were reported by the New York Times, the LA Times and the Hollywood Reporter and very extensively vetted.”According to Simmons’ filing, he and his lawyers unsuccessfully lobbied HBO leaders at the time to stop distribution of the film with unspecified contradictory evidence. “Defendants were requested to review this evidence and information by multiple luminaries in media and politics, including but not limited to, civil rights leaders and members of Congress, and other high-profile black leaders; and board members within the defendant corporation(s) itself,” the filing states.Simmons is one of several high-profile music figures, including fellow producerSean “Diddy” Combsand R&B singerChris Brown, to face multiple lawsuits for sexual misconduct, including from women who appeared in On the Record. He has also followed their footsteps in suing the distributors of documentaries detailing the allegations. Brown claimed defamation in a$500m suitagainst Warner Bros Discovery for releasing the 2024 documentaryChris Brown: A History of Violence, filed this past January. Diddy, who is currently on trial in New York for racketeering and sex trafficking, sued NBC Universal and its streaming service Peacock in February for Diddy: The Making of a Bad Boy, a 90-minute film on the allegations of sexual abuse made in more than three dozen lawsuits.Simmons wasmost recently suedin February 2024 by an anonymous former executive at Def Jam Recording, for an alleged rape in the 1990s and sexual harassment that “disrupted and derailed” her career. In 2023, he reached a confidential settlement with three women, including documentary participant Sil Lai Abrams, who alleged in the film that Simmons raped her in 1994.In all, more than 20 women have accused Simmons of sexual assault. Ansari, his lawyer, works for Aidala, Bertuna & Kamins, a New York-based law firm that is currently representingHarvey Weinsteinin his criminal trial for sexual assault and misconduct. Simmons seeks “immediate removal” of the documentary from HBO’s platforms and $20m in damages.Explore more on these topicsRussell SimmonsDocumentary filmsHBORape and sexual assaultUS television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The affirmation came at the start of a poem by Arthur Berry, written in 1986 to toast the new theatre and welcome audiences to a place of “necessary illusions”. In his native Potteries, Berry is a celebrated polymath, known for his drawings, prints and watercolours, as well as poetry, broadcasting and half a dozen plays, including St George of Scotia Road, the theatre’s opening production.Appropriately, in thiscentenary year of Berry’s birthand three decades after his death, the theatre has dug out the first draft of his final play, spruced it up and given it a belated debut.It is unlikely anyone would consider Whatever Happened to Phoebe Salt a neglected classic. Drawn with the same broad strokes and warm human eye as the sketches that line the upper foyer walls, it is a kitchen-sink drama, evoking the long-lost life of working-class Card Street, Burslem, where the pulse of a pugmill sets a relentless rhythm and the wafer-thin walls permit no secrets.Berry writes with a sense of bittersweet nostalgia: think Terence Davies’sDistant Voices, Still Liveswith the intensity, violence and poetry dialled down. His characters are trapped by circumstance, their lives made smaller by the need to survive.There is Nellie Salt (Laura Costello), washed out and broken, her hopes of betterment dashed by teenage pregnancy. There is her husband, Sammy (Alasdair Baker), gruff and taciturn, his emotions reserved for the care of his pregnant sow he keeps. And above all, there is Phoebe Salt (Isabella Rossi), the “daughter of the sun” and the only colour in Lis Evans’s perfectly drab 1950s set, a young woman bursting with an energy that cannot be contained.Making a debut as assured as it is bolshie, Rossi has the measure of this ever-restless teenager, bored by her faithful fiance (Elliot Goodhill), enticed by the illicit thrill of her married boss (Perry Moore), entertained by the showbiz ambitions of her stage partner (Andrew Pollard), and worth more than all of them put together. In Abbey Wright’s well acted production, she rides above the perfunctory plot and heavily signalled denouement and makes it her own.AtNew Vic, Newcastle-under-Lyme, until 21 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s part of Chance’s self-published collection of short stories and poems, entitled Pandemic Soup for the Soul, a reflection on “what we experienced during the pandemic crisis”, she shared with me in a recent phone call. “It’s crazy how they maintained control and instilled fear within us. When you’re locked up, you ask yourself … are you going to be angry, or are you going to find what your calling and purpose is?”Alabama paid a law firm millions to defend its prisons. It used AI and turned in fake citationsRead moreLocked Down is also one of 16 tracks onBending the Bars, a hip-hop album featuring original songs by artists formerly or currently incarcerated in Florida’s Broward county jails (with the exception of Chance, a Florida native). Bending the Bars was organized by the south Florida abolitionist organizationChip– the Community Hotline for Incarcerated People – which was initially founded to support inmates during the early days of Covid. Nicole Morse, a Chip co-founder and associate professor at the University of Maryland, says the organization began fielding calls in April 2020, primarily from Broward, the county just north of Miami-Dade; the calls were primarily about medical neglect, abuse and an atmosphere of abject fear, perpetuated by guards who demanded silence.It’s no secret that the prison-industrial complex is inherently abusive, especially Florida’s, which has one of thehighest incarceration rates per capita. As Morse explained in an interview, “Most jails and prisons have an element of violence, retaliation, coercion – it’s what the system relies on to control people.” And Broward county is uniquely punitive: “Broward county jails are standouts in how lawless they seem to be, how much the corrections officers are authorized to act without any oversight.” Last year, it wasreportedthat 21 inmates had died in Broward jails since 2021,prompting the NAACPto declare the need for an investigation. In 2021, the data Chip had gathered was used to support a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida and Disability Rights Florida on behalf of individuals suffering from Covid in the Broward county jail.View image in fullscreenGary Field and Kashdat in the recording studio.Photograph: Noam BrownSomething more hopeful was emerging from those hotline calls, too: creativity. “People wanted to share their latest poetry or a song they were developing,” Morse said. “Art was helping people survive an incredibly desperate time.” Noam Brown, a children’s musician and Chip committee member, began dreaming up the idea of an album; Morse, whose research looks at LGBTQ+ cultural production, particularly collaborative media production with incarcerated artists, co-signed the project. They wanted to do more than simply raise awareness. “When you look at how raising awareness functions politically, people who are not impacted by the system tend to get overwhelmed and apathetic, because the system is so violent,” Morse said. Instead, Chip hoped to create a platform for the wealth of talent they continually encountered. The organization began fundraising, applying for grants and putting the word out that they were producing an album; Gary Field, an incarcerated organizer, writer and scholar, became the executive producer, helping to connect the artists with Chip.Musicians on the inside used two phones to record their songs – one as the microphone to record their vocals, the other to listen to the beat. “The challenges were phenomenal,” Field shared in a phone call. “People couldn’t even talk to their families, never mind collaborate on something as complicated as producing a studio album. We were in the middle of a pandemic. There were four phones and 40 inmates trying to use them.” Spaces with two easily accessible phones were limited; the duration of any prison phone call is restricted. But Chip covered the costs of the calls, while Brown’s brother, Eitan, worked as the sound engineer, and the Grammy-winning children’s artists Alphabet Rockets helped create beats. Artists who were already out were able to spend time in the studio, including Chance, who returned to southFloridaafter her release. After reconnecting with a former classmate, the two attended a meeting for Chainless Change, a Lauderhill-based non-profit advocating for those affected by the criminal legal system. “It was divine – I don’t believe in accidents; I knew I was being called to go back to Florida,” Chance said. She began working with the group and helped organize a poetry event, where she met Field, Brown and Morse. She asked if they had room on the album for one more.The result is nearly an hour of uniquely south Floridian hip-hop and R&B, both of which are constellations of so many genres – Caribbean beats, southern bass, Deep City soul, Miami drill – poetic musings on love, loneliness and hope, and demands for systemic change to the draconian and brutal conditions of the Florida prison system. While Morse noted that the album’s sound quality was impaired by technical limitations, Bending the Bars is polished and clear, an accomplishment owed partly to its production and mostly to the ingenuity of its artists: singers, rappers and collaborators like J4, dangeRush and Chuckie Lee, all of whom alchemized the tracklist into a textural tapestry: playful, mournful, educational and intentionally dotted with prerecorded interjections from the prison phone line (“you have one minute remaining”). Field, whose song Tearing Down Walls and Building Bridges closes the album, studied theology at Columbia University and received his master’s from Gulf Coast Bible College, and has contributed 2,000 pages of writing to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology civic media project Between the Bars. He knows, intimately, the significance of the writing process. “I remember, as an inmate back in 2010, what a profound sense of gratitude the opportunity to write gave me,” he shared. “The relationship between writing, rap, hip-hop, music, jails, prison – it’s really intertwined.”View image in fullscreenBending the Bars artists Kashdatt, Chuckie Lee and ZQ recording in the studio.Photograph: Noam BrownCounty jails, Field added, are incubators for hip-hop, especially in Broward county, which cultivated “legends like Kodak Black and YNW Melly … but the diversity of voices on Bending the Bars is a natural extension of the eclectic mix of detainees that can be found in almost any urban jail”. Field added that space for writing, and a deeper understanding of philosophical ideology, are inevitable on the inside. “While on an academic level, philosophy can be broken down into many categories – ontology, epistemology, ethics, morality – in its simplest sense, philosophy is man’s attempt to figure out the world around him and his place in it,” he said. “When that world is reduced to what lies behind the razor wire, an old-timer who has served 35 years … can provide more wisdom than someone with a PhD in metaphysics.”The system often censored mail or blocked phone calls during the recording process; Morse said that this necessitated new pathways for the collaborators to connect with each other. “We had to develop a set of strategies to overcome those barriers,” they said. “The project was made without the cooperation of any prison or jail. Every strategy we came up with for how to get through to people, how to connect with them, how to find them if they seem to have disappeared in the system – we can now share those strategies with loved ones of incarcerated folks who don’t have any additional privileged access.” It’s for this reason that Chip hopes the album will serve as a model for ways of interacting with and caring for those inside the system – and for future creative endeavors. “Gary always says there’s thousands of jails in the country, and in each one, there are folks who have as much talent as the people we connected to,” Morse added. “We did this independently and autonomously. We hope this inspires others.” In 2026, Chip will release a documentary about the process.After our call, which was cut off due to time restrictions, Field sent an email describing the prison-industrial complex as “an insidious and intentional campaign” that, he warned, is an ongoing harbinger of societal abuse, regardless of a person’s criminal background. “If allowed to continue unchecked, it will not be content with feeding upon the poor, minorities, those suffering from substance abuse issues and undocumented immigrants. How long until the weaponization of the justice department begins to target journalists, educators, scientists, researchers, protesters and even some politicians as enemies of the people? The time to recognize, organize and speak out is now.” It’s a point he illustrates in his song: “Well, they’ve criminalized mental illness and treat addiction as a crime / How long do you think this moves from the shadows to prime time? / … Won’t you raise your voice / Help someone to stand up / Silence is a choice.”Bending the Bars is released on 11 JuneExplore more on these topicsHip-hopUS prisonsCoronavirusFloridaRapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is nothing anywhere in the world like it. For all of its problems, I still see that it has this ability to change people’s lives and teach people the job of being a comedian.”Now, as the cost of taking shows to the fringe continues to rise, current members of the Durham Revue and other student sketch groups say they are being priced out of the performing arts festival.“We’re looking at the fact that this could be our last year,” says Alannah O’Hare, co-president of the Durham Revue, which as well as Kumar, countsAmbika Mod,Ed Gamble, Bafta-nominated TV writer Tom Neenan and Taskmaster’s Stevie Martin as alumni. The group has gone to the fringe almost every year since the mid-70s. “There’s a huge legacy there,” says O’Hare. “But it’s becoming increasingly impossible.”View image in fullscreen‘There is nothing anywhere in the world like it’ … Nish Kumar at the Edinburgh fringe in 2022.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the GuardianDurham isn’t the only university with a legacy of developing comedy talent. As well as the Cambridge Footlights and Oxford Revue, there is the Bristol Revunions, rekindled in 2008 by Charlie Perkins (now Channel 4’s head of comedy), which counts Jamie Demetriou, Ellie White and Charlotte Ritchie as former members. In the north-west there are the Manchester Revue and the Leeds Tealights, which boasts comedians Annie McGrath and Jack Barry, producer Phoebe Bourke and comedy agent Chris Quaile among its alumni.Kumar first experienced the fringe’s transformative effects in 2006. Every year, Revue members write sketches and put on shows in Durham, with the goal of creating an hour of comedy gold for the festival. “That was the whole purpose, because we wanted to be professional comedians and there isn’t an obvious route,” Kumar says. Performing every day for a month improved his writing, plus, he says: “You get a certain comfort that means you’re not having a full-blown physiological panic attack every time you stand on stage. That confidence never leaves you.”Students also get the chance to watch other shows, which “teaches you a lot about what you can do in comedy” and helped Kumar understand that not every interesting comedian is a TV star, but there’s a pipeline to it. “I got to see Russell Howard in a room with 100 people and then six months later he appeared on TV,” Kumar says.Crucially, students get to experience this without racking up substantial debt. “The opportunity to go as students where you’re not putting huge amounts of personal finances at risk, it’s a really fleeting opportunity,” says O’Hare. If students must fund the experience themselves, “you’ll lose working-class voices, you’ll lose lower-middle-class voices,” says Kumar. “But we won’t lose art from posh people because they have independent wealth.”McGrath, who attended three fringes with the Tealights, agrees: “Edinburgh has already become wildly unaffordable for so many acts and punters, and landlords have a lot to answer for. It’s really sad as it could wipe out a generation of new talent. It also means there’s a lack of diversity in what is being created if only the wealthiest acts and biggest names are able to go.”Her student experience was “totally magical” and “instrumental in shaping the path I took after university,” McGrath says. “Edinburgh is where I met so many of my comedy contemporaries, and I managed to get an agent the summer I graduated which gave me the confidence to think this could be a viable career.”View image in fullscreen‘There’s a huge legacy there’ … Alannah O’Hare (far right) in Durham Revue in 2024.Photograph: Thomas TomlinsonDurham Revue and other troupes fund fringe runs from profits of the previous year, with extra money raised by staging shows throughout the year and, if they’re lucky, grants from their university. These are not guaranteed and becoming harder to secure as university finances are squeezed, say O’Hare and Evie Cowen from the Leeds Tealights.The biggest hurdles are venue and accommodation costs, says O’Hare. This year, the Revue will spend about £9,000 on accommodation – 60% of its overall costs – “and that’s students sharing beds, it’s not luxurious living”. Cowen says the Tealights have found accommodation for £6,500, a huge increase on the £4,000 spent in 2023.To cover the increases, Durham Revue has started its first crowdfunder, to which Kumar and other alumni have contributed. Yet this “does not offer a long-term solution”, O’Hare says. Leeds Tealights turns 20 this year and hopes money raised from an anniversary show will cover festival costs. Both groups worry about how they will bridge the gap in 2026.“It feels like the inaccessibility of it has accelerated over the past few years, and it’s impacting young people and students and people starting out,” O’Hare says.Is there a solution? Kumar says lack of university investment is “shortsighted”. “I’d definitely like to see more bursaries coming in to help,” Kumar says. “They’re talking about placing taxes on streaming services to reinvest into UK television – I’d like to see more of that invested into grassroots arts programmes. We need to look at how arts funding has been slowly chipped away for the past 15 years.”If students from all financial backgrounds can no longer attend the fringe, “you’re losing a really valuable training ground,” Kumar says. “Comedy is one of the things we still do well in this country. Not providing funding for it is insane.”Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)StudentsTheatreStudent financeUniversitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

To him, commercial flops were rarely the result of audiences misunderstanding his work, but a regrettable failure on his part to connect with them. So it’s notable that Wilder didn’t have kind things to say about theMarilyn Monroecomedy The Seven Year Itch, a box-office sensation that’s rightfully settled a few tiers below classics like Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard, The Apartment and Some Like It Hot, his brilliant second go-around with Monroe.Gentlemen Prefer Blondes at 70: Marilyn Monroe remains a dazzling starRead moreA work-for-hire job for Darryl Zanuck at 20th Century Fox, The Seven Year Itch didn’t originate with Wilder, but George Axelrod’s 1952 Broadway comedy about marital wanderlust, with its ping-pong between lustiness and guilt, seemed well-suited to his sensibility. But the real tension that undermines the film is the ping-pong between Monroe’s five-alarm sexuality and the wet-blanket prudishness that keeps putting out the fire. Wilder and Axelrod, who also scripted, were “straitjacketed” by the Hays code, which imposed strict limits on how far the film could go, and Wilder couldn’t work around it. He called it a “nothing picture” because censors neutered a comedy about infidelity. A comedy about mere temptation doesn’t have the same pop.Seventy years later, The Seven Year Itch may not be remembered as a great movie, but it’ll forever be cherished as a grate movie. Wilder sensed a scene where Monroe, in a form-fitting white dress, positions herself above a subway grate on Lexington Avenue would cause a stir, so he leaned into it, turning the shoot into a media frenzy that yielded one of the signature images of Monroe’s career. It’s also a prime example of the uncorked sexuality that Monroe brought to the table, which even the Hays code couldn’t hope to suppress. On a date with an older, married man – the movie they see, Creature from the Black Lagoon, is much more erotic than this one – her character explains that she likes to feel the wind from passing trains under her dress. She’s unashamed by the feeling.Yet shame proves to be a heavy anchor for Richard Sherman (Tom Ewell), a middle-aged paperback book publisher whose tendency to daydream about romantic encounters seems to manifest a fantasy girl come to life. After sending his wife, Helen (Evelyn Keyes), and their son off to Maine for hot summer months, Richard toys with how much he’s going to let himself off the leash while he reclaims his bachelorhood. He’s a good boy at first, dining at a vegetarian restaurant because “you can’t run on martinis and Hungarian goulash”. But those martinis can easily be shaken in his Manhattan apartment, and though he keeps his cigarettes under lock and key, it’s only a small hassle to access them when he gets the urge.Still, there are common urges and then there’s Marilyn Monroe as “the girl”, the bubbly and endlessly accommodating blonde who’s moved into the place upstairs. She nearly kills Richards when a tomato plant on her balcony drops through his lounge chair, but that proves to be enough of a meet-cute to get her to come down for a drink. Before she arrives, he dreams of seducing her with cocktails and Rachmaninoff, but she proves more enticed by the lowbrow appeals of Chopsticks and dipping potato chips in champagne. They’re an odd couple, but nothing seems to turn her off, including his wedding ring, and plenty turns him on, like an “artistic picture” in a bikini she took for a magazine he has on his shelf.The title The Seven Year Itch refers to a dubious piece of psychology suggesting married men tire of their wives after seven years and start looking around for a mistress. Many of the laughs in Axelrod’s script come from Richard twisting himself into knots over whether he’s that type of guy or not, which the play answers one way and the movie answers another. Wilder does his best to bring Richard’s tortured conscience to visual life, with sequences that toggle between fantasy and reality, creating not only a window into his thinking but also opening up what’s mostly a one-room stage play. The trouble is that Ewell, who originated the role on Broadway, is a bit of a drip as a leading man. (Wilder wanted the then unknown Walter Matthau, who’d have been a terrific choice.)Virtually all the energy in The Seven Year Itch comes from Monroe, whose sexual confidence is as weirdly innocent as it is incandescent, as if she doesn’t comprehend her own power. (“People keep falling desperately in love with me,” she says, as if it’s a mystery she can’t begin to start cracking.) Referring to her simply as “the girl” is an icky sign of the times, as though Axelrod and Wilder can’t imagine her as a woman who exists apart from Richard’s imagination. But Monroe makes so singular an impression that she dwarfs the film’s ostensible star, who looks one-dimensional and feckless by comparison.Wilder is right to believe the material might have thrived in an era in which infidelity was allowed to be the theme, because without it, the stakes of The Seven Year Itch are almost non-existent. Monroe should overwhelm Ewell like Barbara Stanwyck does Henry Fonda in The Lady Eve, a comedy that was also made under the code but is arousing and dangerous in a way that The Seven Year Itch never becomes. Monroe may have been the embodiment of temptation in the era, but the possibility of sex is off the table. It’s an itch the film can never scratch.Explore more on these topicsMarilyn MonroeBilly WilderComedy filmsComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The TV clicks off. The steady hum of electricity gives way to silence, swallowed by the creeping Lagos heat and the lingering scent of lavender from a diffuser. Everyone in the room sighs.We’re in the flat of 23-year-old musician M3lon in the suburb of Lekki, talking about Nigeria’s Afro-Adura, also known as trenches music (trench being a slang term for a ghetto or impoverished area). This is raw songcraft drawing together gospel, trap and the energetic Nigerian pop style of fuji, leaning heavily on Yoruba proverbs, idioms and faith – adura translates to prayer.It feels apt that the electricity has just gone off. Struggle and survival walk hand-in-hand in this music, whose roots are as far back as the late 00s when the popular Afrobeats vocalist Oritse Femi pivoted to faith-centred songwriting with Mercies of the Lord. Afro-Adura cries out and clings desperately to God, and its strongly religious audience use it to weather the daily grind of economic collapse.M3lon’s track Nepa, the haunting opener of his EP When Life Gives You Melons, captures this tension perfectly – it’s a reference to Nigeria’s electric utility company, and a mirror held up to the quiet powerlessness that millions of Nigerians, himself included, live with daily. “Growing up in thelungu” –a colloquial reference to the trenches – “of Ikorodu, there were times we’d go weeks without light,” he says. “Now I live in one of the poshest areas in Lagos, and there are nights I sleep in [total] darkness. This song is a tribute to that.”In April 2024, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission approved a sharp tariff hike for electricity users in Band A – customers who receive at least 20 hours of power supply daily – raising rates from ₦68 (three pence) per kilowatt hour to a staggering ₦225 (11 pence). Though later revised slightly, the more than 200% spike sent shock waves through schools, businesses, and homes like M3lon’s. Like many Nigerians, he now lives in a reality where electricity is both inconsistent and unaffordable.It’s why a lyric like “Nepa no tan na, but my people still turn up” resonates so powerfully. In Nigeria, turning up – ie partying – in the dark isn’t just resilience, it’s ritual, and this defiant joy in the face of systemic failure gives trenches music its inspirational heft.In a country where over 130 million people live in multidimensional poverty, it’s not just electricity in crisis. Inflation is at its highest in decades: transport fares have nearly doubled since a fuel subsidy removal in May 2023 and bag of rice costs over ₦80,000 (£37) in some cities. 27-year-old Olanrewaju, an aspiring photographer, says Afro-Adura gives him hope when gigs are scarce. “I resonate deeply with the struggles and sombre sonic disposition of the flag bearers of the sound,” he says. “To relish sound in its purest form, you need to have lived it.”“Electricity has gone up, even the petrol we rely on can’t power our generators at length any more,” says 25-year-old Adekunle, a fuel attendant. M3lon and I have come to refill his generator, and as Adekunle fills our keg, I notice his dangling earphones and ask what he is listening to. “Na Seyi o! No Seyi, no vibes,” he says, naming one of the genre’s most successful artists.View image in fullscreenBhadboi OML.Photograph: Tope Adenola / Horpload works photographyOn his 2022 album Billion Dollar Baby, Seyi Vibez charts his escape from poverty. Songs such as Ife and Saro recall life in the trenches, his rise to affluence steeped in gratitude and grief. The pain isn’t just in the lyrics – it pulses in the percussion, the tremble in his voice, the minor keys. The music remembers the cost of the climb.Bhadboi OML, another rising star, continues in this tradition, bridging struggle and salvation with unfussy candour. His new project Bhad Boi (Deluxe), he says, “is everything I’ve seen and felt. It’s like writing my life with beats.” While OML acknowledges that not all his music fits neatly into the trenches music box any more, the heart of the genre – truth-telling, grit, hope – remains in every bar. “People just want something real,” he adds. “When music speaks to what they’re going through, it hits different. Trenches music isn’t just about hurt but also about power, and turning pain into prayer and community.”To Diamond Jimma, another prodigy of the genre, faith isn’t just part of Afro-Adura – it’s how he and his listeners make sense of life. “Faith becomes the light we hold on to when everything else is dark – and through Afro-Adura, we turn that light into sound,” he says.Back at M3lon’s, we step out on to the balcony. The blackout has thickened the silence, broken only by the distant hum of a neighbouring estate’s generator. Below, Lekki stretches out like a glitching constellation – mansions lit up beside others swallowed by darkness. It’s symbolic of who gets to live with ease and who must endure, of who eats three times a day and who prays over empty pots. “This view is crazy,” M3lon says quietly. “Millions in light. Millions in darkness. Same city. Same country.”Explore more on these topicsPop and rockNigeriaAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

In between, he edited the magazine National Review, wrote three columns a week, wrote or dictated hundreds of letters a month, and was known to dash off a book while on vacation. He wasphotographedworking at a typewriter in the back of a limousine as a dog looked on. In Aladdin (1992), Robin Williams’s geniedoesBuckley as one of his impressions.Buckley’s extraordinary energy is captured in a sweeping new biography that also uses its subject to tell a larger story of the American right. “As far as I’m concerned, he invented politics as cultural warfare, and that’s what we’re seeing now,” the writer Sam Tanenhaus said.View image in fullscreenSam Tanenhaus’s new biography, Buckley: The Life and Revolution that Changed America.Photograph: Random HouseTanenhaus spent nearly three decades researching an authorized biography that was published on Tuesday, titled Buckley: The Life and Revolution that Changed America.Buckley is often remembered as the architect of the modern conservative movement. For decades he worked to unite anti-communists, free marketeers and social conservatives into the coalition behind the Reagan revolution. Yet today, almost two decades since Buckley’s death in 2008, the conservative landscape looks different. Free trade is out, economic protectionism is in. The Republican party’s base of support, once the most educated and affluent, is now increasingly working-class.Even asDonald Trumpremakes the right in his own image, however, Tanenhaus sees Buckley’s thumbprints.One of the biggest is Trumpism’s suspicion of intellectual elites. Although Buckley was a blue blood and loved the company of artists and literary people, he memorably said that he would “sooner live in a society governed by the first 2,000 names in the Boston telephone directory than in a society governed by the 2,000 faculty members of Harvard University”.His first book, in 1951, accused professors of indoctrinating students with liberal and secularist ideas – more than half a century before theTrump administration’s bruising attempts to pressure Ivy League universities into political fealty.[The left doesn’t] understand how closely the right has been studying them all these yearsSam TanenhausTanenhaus, the former editor of the New York Times Book Review, spoke to me by video call from his house in Connecticut. He is a gregarious and funny conversationalist. At one point, he paused a digression about Joan Didion to observe: “Wow. There’s a vulture in my backyard. For God’s sake.” He said he looked forward to reading my piece about him, “unless you’re saying bad stuff about me. Then send it to me and say: ‘My editors made me write this.’”Our free-flowing, one-and-half-hour conversation gave me some sense of why Tanenhaus’s biography took so long to write. It also made me better understand how the conservative Buckley was charmed into the decision to allow a self-described “lifelong unregistered liberal Democrat” unfettered access to his papers, and to give that person the final – or at least most comprehensive – word on his life.The outcome is a lively, balanced and deeply researched book. At more than 1,000 pages, including end matter, the hardback is an engrossing, if occasionally wrist-straining, read.View image in fullscreenGuy de Rothschild, Patricia Buckley (obscured), and Pat Patterson (obscured) attend a party at the Buckley residence in New York City on 17 January 1984.Photograph: WWD/Penske Media/Getty ImagesTanenhaus was born in 1955, three weeks before Buckley published the first issue of National Review. Writing the book, he said, often felt like a kind of “reconstructive journalism” where he relived history that he had experienced but never considered in its context. As a liberal and an “unobservant, ignorant, secular Jew”, he also had to try to understand someone with whom he had little in common, politically or culturally.Although Buckley’s views on some subjects evolved over time, “he was pretty and firmly entrenched with two foundational ideas,” Tanenhaus said. “One was Catholicism, which was the most important thing in his life. The second was a kind of evangelical capitalism.”Unlike many of his mentors and allies, who tended to be ex-Marxists or ex-liberals, Buckley was not an ideological convert. His father, a wealthy, devoutly Catholic and rightwing oilman from Texas who raised his large family in Connecticut and across Europe, loomed large over his early life.Buckley and his nine siblings were desperate to impress their father. He was loving to his family and also racist, in a “genteel Bourbon” way, and antisemitic, in a more vitriolic way. In 1937, when Buckley was 11, his older siblings burned a cross in front of a Jewish resort. He later recounted the story with embarrassment but argued that his siblings did not understand the gravity of what they were doing.Although Buckley came to make a real effort to purge the right of racist, antisemitic and fringe elements, Tanenhaus thinks his upbringing held sway longer than most people realize. One of the most interesting sections of the book concerns Camden, South Carolina, where Buckley’s parents had a home. In the 1950s the town became notorious for violence against black people and white liberals.View image in fullscreenFamily photos displayed at the Buckley residence in New York City on 17 January 1984.Photograph: WWD/Penske Media/Getty ImagesDuring his research, Tanenhaus discovered that the Buckleys – who were considered by their black domestic workers to be unusually kind relative to the white people of the area – also funded the town’s pro-segregation paper and had ties to a local white supremacist group. After a spate of racist attacks in Camden, Buckley wrote a piece in National Review condemning the violence, but not segregation itself. Hedefendedsegregation on the grounds that white people were, for the time being, the culturally “superior” race.Buckley’s views on race began to change in the 1960s. He was horrified by the Birmingham church bombing that killed four little girls. During his unsuccessful third-party campaign for mayor of New York in 1965, he surprised both conservatives and liberals byendorsingaffirmative action. In 1970 he argued that within a decade the United States might have a black president and that this event would be a “welcome tonic”.Despite his patrician manner and distinctaccent, Buckley had a savvy understanding of the power of mass media and technology. National Review was never read by a wide audience, but Buckley and his conservative vanguard fully embraced radio, television and other media. A technophile, he was one of the first to adopt MCI mail, an early version of email. Tanenhaus thinks he would thrive in the age of Twitter and podcasts.Yet the current era feels a world away in other respects. For one, Buckley’s politics rarely affected his many friendships. “His best friends were liberals,” Tanenhaus said. He greatly admired Jesse Jackson. It was not strange for Eldridge Cleaver, the black nationalist, and Timothy Leary, the psychonaut, to stop by his house.Baldwin v Buckley: how the ‘debate play’ made a riveting resurgenceRead moreBuckley was deeply embarrassed by the notorious1968 incidentin which Gore Vidal called him a “crypto-Nazi”, on-air, and Buckley responded by calling Vidal an alcoholic “queer” and threatening to punch him. It was an exception to a code of conduct that Buckley generally tried to live by.“If he became your friend, and then you told him you joined the Communist party, he would say: ‘That is the worst thing you can do, I’m shocked you would do it, but you’re still coming over for dinner tomorrow, right?’” Tanenhaus laughed. “It’s just a different worldview, and we don’t get it because we take ourselves more seriously than he did.”Being the authorized biographer of a living person entails a special relationship. You become intimately familiar with your subject – perhaps even good friends, as Tanenhaus and his wife did with Buckley and his socialite wife, Pat. Yet you also need critical distance to write honestly.It was impossible to finish the book “while he was still alive”, Tanenhaus said. He realized in retrospect that Buckley’s death was “the only way that I could gain the perspective I needed, the distance from him and the events that he played an important part in, to be able to wrap my arms around them”.He thinks Buckley also understood that a true biography would be a full and frank accounting of his life. “I think that, in some way, he wanted someone to come along and maybe understand things he didn’t understand about himself.”Despite his disagreements with Buckley’s politics, Tanenhaus was ultimately left with a positive assessment of him as a person. “He had a warmth and generosity that are uncommon. When you’re a journalist, part of your business is interacting in some way with the great, and the great always remind you that you’re not one of them. They have no interest in you. They never ask you about yourself. Buckley was not like that.”He is not sure what he would have made of Trump. Buckley was willing to criticize the right, and was an early critic of the Iraq war, Tanenhaus said. Yet “conservatives can always find a way to say: ‘Whatever our side is doing, the other side is worse.’”View image in fullscreenWilliam F Buckley Jr talking on the phone at home in his study.Photograph: Truman Moore/Getty ImagesThis is Tanenhaus’s third book about conservatism. I asked what he thinks the left most misunderstands about the right.He instantly responded: “They don’t understand how closely the right has been studyingthemall these years.” He noted that Buckley surrounded himself with ex-leftists and that he and other conservatives made a point of reading left and liberal books and studying their tactics of political organizing.But that doesn’t seem to go the opposite direction. Leftists and liberals “don’t see that the other side should be listened to, that there’s anything to learn from them. And they think, no matter how few of them there are, that they’re always in the majority.”Buckley once said that his “idea of a counter-revolution is one in which we overturn the view of society that came out of the New Deal”, Tanenhaus said. Today, Trump is aggressively moving, with mixed success, to roll back the federal administrative state – a vestige of Buckley’s vision of unfettered capitalism, even if Trump’s other economic views aren’t exactly Buckley’s.“It would not be far-fetched to say we are now seeing the fulfillment of what he had in mind,” Tanenhaus said.Explore more on these topicsBiography booksMagazinesUS politicsRepublicansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With characteristic exactness and compassion, Swift considers the cost of human conflict in all its forms – and the challenge, for those who manage to stay alive, of retrieving the past.In The Next Best Thing former Leutnant Büchner, gatekeeping civic records in postwar Germany in 1959, fields a British serviceman’s attempts to trace the fate of his German Jewish relatives during the Holocaust. Denial and guilt vie chillingly in a tale about the agony of looking back when there are only “pathetic little scraps of paper” to be found. “What did they expect, after all, what did they really hope for,” Büchner wonders, “these needy and haunted ones who still, after 15 years, kept coming forward … To be given back the actual ashes, the actual dust, the actual bones?”In Blushes the “ghost world” we’re shown is the suddenly empty one created by the Covid pandemic, with its unpeopled streets and rising death toll. Here the war being fought is the war against disease. Hinges, meanwhile, takes us into the thoughts of a middle-aged woman during her father’s funeral. As the coffin is brought to the cemetery she thinks back to a day when, as a girl, she waited with him for a carpenter to arrive and fix their creaking front door. The door, he’d explained, was 90 years old. Swift’s conceptual agility is on dazzling display here:But she couldn’t have thought, then, what her 49-year-old self could think: that 90 years was the length of a decent human life, though rather longer, as it had proved, than her father’s. And she surely couldn’t have thought then, as she thought now, that there were two things, generally made of wood, specifically designed to accommodate the dimensions of a single human being. Two objects of carpentry. A door and a coffin. It was like the answer to a riddle.Neat as the parallel is, if these stories occasionally feel a little pat, it is precisely because they are so smoothly jointed. Sometimes the “hinge” involves a moment of slick linguistic doubleness. The carpenter in Hinges is called Joe Short – “As in ‘life is short’,” we’re reminded. In Black, another daughter makes sense of the way her angry coalminer father and his friends terrorised their families by concluding that “their place was the pit and they didn’t want pity”. The riddle of life, you suspect, isn’t that easily solved.In Twelve Post-War Tales the craving for life and the pull towards death are murkily intertwinedWhere the moral focus is blurrier, the emotional payoff is often much greater. Beauty is a story of bereavement without a resolution: hoping for closure, a grandfather pays a secret visit to the university residence where his granddaughter Clare recently killed herself, only to feel like “an old man among ghostly young people”. The tale is a haunting palimpsest of shifting impressions. While the dean is showing him to Clare’s dorm, he’s incongruously aroused by her beauty. She tells him that the room “has now been cleared” and he notes that “there was the little collision of ‘Clare’ and ‘clear’. They were the same word.” But is anything clear? In this story the craving for life and the pull towards death are murkily intertwined. On the train back, even “the scudding fields and trees became obscure”. The image of dissolution tugs at the heart, without trying to reel us in.Swift’s interest in what a meaningful reconstruction of the past might look like achieves an even deeper resonance in the final piece, Passport. Though she’s in her 80s and doesn’t expect to travel again, Anna-Maria Anderson has recently renewed this official proof of identity. She concedes ruefully that “there really was no way of travelling through time”, which is what she would really like to do. But of course, there is; this story is it. As she thinks, marvelling, of her parents’ love affair during the Spanish civil war and her own survival, as a baby, of the Blitz bomb that killed her mother, the piece becomes a moving reflection on the haphazardness as well as the serendipity of life. But it acknowledges something else too: the awkwardness of growing old, and its inescapable tedium. “If life turns out to be short, well then that’s cruel,” Anna-Maria decides. “But when life is long, that can be cruel too.” Skilful, generous and humane, these 12 tales suggest the complexity and heartbreak of being engaged on such an uncertain journey.Twelve Post-War Tales by Graham Swift is published by Scribner (£18.99).

These singular beasties – centipedes,spiders, scorpions, leeches, snails and woodlice – derive their daily nutrients from slimy mats of sulphur-loving bacteria that thrive in the oxygen-poor atmosphere.This unique ecosystem was isolated for more than 5m years until 1986, when drilling for a potential power plant pierced the cave’s walls. As the science writer Alex Riley reports in Super Natural,37 out of the 52 invertebrate species living in the 240-metre-long space – which sits 21 metres below the surface near the Black Sea coast – exist nowhere else on Earth.While our ancestors were evolving in the intervening aeons – learning how to use fire, circling the globe, discovering petroleum and then polluting the atmosphere with greenhouse gases – “the animals in Movile cave slurped up their microbial crop” oblivious to the world outside.They represent just a few of the exotic species that populate Riley’s fascinating portrait of how life survives despite radiation, desiccation, the heat of the Sahara, freezing polar temperatures, total darkness, extended famine, lack of oxygen and the oceans’ abyssal depths.Among them are the hardy tardigrades, cute little invertebrate “moss piglets”half a millimetre longthat can withstand “unimaginable extremes”, including “freezing to near absolute zero, boiling heat, pulverising radiation, the vacuum of space” (they’ve been taken into orbit several times). But there are also more familiar creatures, including mammals and birds. Withinthe Chornobyl exclusion zone, wild Przewalski’s horses – a oncenear-extinct species– thrive and reproduce despite the lingering radiation. In North America, the common poorwill (orhölchoko, “the sleeping one” in Hopi) is the only bird known to hibernate, lowering its body temperature to 5C (41F) and remaining in this torpid state for weeks.The deep ocean was once regarded as hostile to any form of life, with 19th-century biologists such as Louis Agassiz deeming it “quite impassable for marine animals”. There was no sustenance for them , he wrote, “and it is doubtful if animals could sustain the pressure of so great a column of water”. That turned out to be wrong, and in 2022 scientists were able to film thePseudoliparissnailfishat 8,336 metres below sea leveloff the coast of Japan – a depth roughly equivalent to the height of Everest.It doesn’t stop there. “Sea stars, isopods, sea cucumbers, glass sponges: all have representatives that filter water or sediment to feed in waters over 10 kilometers down.” The most common are scavenging crustaceans that feed on the dead organisms falling from above – one of which, the supergiant amphipodAlicella gigantea, looks like a flea and can grow to the size of a rat.Sadly, their diet has begun to change. Dissecting an amphipod collected in the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific, ecologist Johanna Weston “found a blue microscopic fibre inside its stomach. Just over half a millimetre long and shaped like an archer’s bow, it was a sliver of polyethylene terephthalate.” That’s the plastic used in water bottles, and Weston named the speciesEurythenes plasticus.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The minutes he spends observing this tiny animal with its “eight chubby legs” open “a tiny portal into a world beyond humanity”.It’s also oddly comforting to realise that nature is highly resilient, enduring five mass extinctions before the current, sixth one. The Permian extinction, caused by volcanic activity 252m years ago, killed 96% of all life in the oceans. And yet, by clearing the seabed of rugose corals and trilobites, “a new world of predatory cephalopods, crabs, snails, sharks, bony fish and marine reptiles could emerge”, writes Riley. And, whatever happens, you can bet that near-indestructible tardigrades will continue plodding along. “Life, once it has emerged on a planet, is very hard to destroy.”Super Natural: How Life Thrives in Impossible Places by Alex Riley is published by Atlantic (£22).

In its wisdom, Nintendo has decided not to send review units out until the day before release, so as you read this I will be standing impatiently by the door like a dog anxiously awaiting its owner.I have played the console, though, for a whole day at Nintendo’s offices, so I can give you some first impressions. Hardware-wise, it is the upgrade of my dreams: sturdier JoyCons, a beautiful screen, the graphical muscle to make games look as good as I want them to in 2025 (though still not comparable to the high-end PlayStation 5 Pro or a modern gaming PC). I like the understated pops of colour on the controllers, the refined menu with its soothing chimes and blips. Game sharing, online functionality and other basic stuff is frictionless now. I love that Nintendo Switch Online is so reasonably priced, at£18 a year, as opposed to about the same per month for comparable gaming services, and it gives me access to a treasure trove of Nintendo games from decades past.But here’s the key word in that paragraph: it’s an upgrade. After eight years, an upgrade feels rather belated. I was hoping for something actually new, and aside from the fact that you can now use those controllers as mice by turning them sideways and moving them around on a desk or on your lap, there isn’t much new in the Switch 2. Absorbed in Mario Kart World, the main launch title, it was easy to forget I was even playing a new console. I do wonder –as I did in January– whether many less gaming-literate families who own a Switch will see a reason to upgrade, given the£400 asking price.View image in fullscreenBrilliant … Mario Kart World.Photograph: NintendoSpeaking ofMario KartWorld, though: it’s brilliant. Totally splendid. It will deservedly sell squillions. Alongside the classic competitive grand prix and time trial races, the headline feature is an open, driveable world that you can explore all you like, as any character, picking up characters and costumes and collectibles, and getting into elimination-style races that span the full continent. All the courses are part of one huge map, and they flow right into one another.Your kart transforms helpfully into a boat when you hit water, and I found an island with a really tricky challenge where I had to ride seaplanes up towards a skyscraper in the city, driving over their wings from one to the other. Anyone could lose hours driving aimlessly around the colourful collection of mountains, jungles and winding motorways here. There’s even a space-station themed course that cleverly echoes the original Donkey Kong arcade game, delivering a nostalgia hit as delightful as Super Mario Odyssey’s climactic New Donk City festival.Pushing Buttons correspondent Keith Stuart alsohad a great timewith another launch game, Konami’s Survival Kids, which is a bit like Overcooked except all the players are working together to survive on a desert island. (Be reassured, if you generally find survival games hard work: it’s very much fun over peril.)However: I would steer clear of theNintendoSwitch Welcome Tour, an almost belligerently un-fun interactive tour of the console’s new features … that costs £7.99. Your tiny avatar walks around a gigantic recreation of a Switch 2 console, looking for invisible plaques that point out its different components. There are displays with uninteresting technical information about, say, the quality of the console’s HD rumble. One of the interactive museum displays shows a ball bounding across the screen and asks you to guess how many frames per second it is travelling at. As someone who aggressively does not care about fine technical detail, I was terrible at this. It’s like being on the least interesting school trip of your life.And it felt felt remarkably un-Nintendo, so dry and devoid of personality that it made me a little worried.Nintendo Labo, by contrast, was a super-fun and accessible way of showing off the original Switch’s technical features. I had assumed that Welcome Tour would be made by the same team, but evidently not.I couldn’t wait to get back to Mario Kart World, which, once again, is fantastic. I’m excited to spend the rest of the week playing it for a proper review. And if you’ve pre-ordered a Switch 2, you’ll have it in your hands in the next 24 hours. For those holding off: we’ll have plenty more Switch 2 info and opinions in the next few weeks to help you make a decision.What to playArms akimbo … to a T is funny and weird.Illustration: Annapurna interactive/SteamLast week I played throughto a T, the beautifully strange, unexpectedly thoughtful new game from Katamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi. It is about a young teenager who is forever stuck in a T-pose, arms akimbo. As you might imagine, this makes life rather difficult for them, and they must rely on their fluffy little dog to help them through life. It’s a kid-friendly game about accepting who you are – I played it with my sons – but it is also extremely funny and weird, and features a song about a giraffe who loves to make sandwiches. I love a game where you don’t know what to expect, and I bet that if I asked every single reader of this newsletter to guess how it ends, not one of you would be anywhere close.Available on:PS5, Xbox, PCEstimated playtime:five hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenTake chances … Remy Siu (left) and Nhi Do accept the Peabody award for 1000xRESIST.Photograph: Charley Gallay/Getty images1000xRESIST, last year’s critical darling sci-fi game about the immigrant experience and the cost of political resistance,won a Peabody awardthis week.

Take the opening, where she appears in pale rose dress, partner José Maldonado in dusky pink, and they circle each other, eyes locked, not predatory but sweet, coquettish and companionable, and all attention is quietly drawn to them.That’s no disrespect to the musicians – a simple set-up with singer David Lagos, guitarist Santiago Lara and palmas (hand claps) provided by twins Antonio and Manuel Montes Saavedra. It’s only that Ruiz’s show is the antidote to the full-volume, all-feet-firing, tearing-one’s-heart-out onslaught of much virtuoso flamenco.Ruiz appears as part of London’s annual Flamenco festival, which features a wide range of musicians and dancers, some pushing the art form in unexpected directions, others keeping a more traditional flame aglow. Ruiz, who has been leading her own company for 22 years, is more in the latter camp, dressed in demure version of classic flamenco style: the long ruffled bata de cola skirt, the mantón shawl, Cordobés hat, fan and castanets.She is, as it happens, a demon on those castanets (same when it comes to finger clicks). Sometimes she holds them behind her back, we hear their twittering out of sight, and it’s like her thoughts whirring, a little subtext to the relationship we see on stage – although this doesn’t feel like a deeply subtextual work. It’s an ode to the art, which Ruiz has absorbed deeply and returns to us with a light touch, hands like fine lace, smile like warm sun. There’s a gentleness to Ruiz’s petal-soft movement, it is playful and delicate and precise. Meanwhile, the gentlemanly Maldonado supports, enhances, but doesn’t try to upstage Ruiz. It’s wonderful to hear the subtleties in his footwork, the conversational tones and controlled dynamic, accented with a well-placed sforzando in agreement with the climax of a musical phrase.Romancero del Baile Flamenco may seem a little tame in comparison with some of the festival’s other offerings, the starry bravura of Sara Baras, the progressive politics ofManuel Liñanor duoEstévez/Paños’s experimentation with form but there is absolutely a place for a class act like Ruiz, even if this outing doesn’t thoroughly enthral.Flamenco festival continues until 8 JuneExplore more on these topicsDanceFlamencoSadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But this production shows his late work contains genuine warmth – and love – beneath the disappointments and dishonesties of married life.Longsuffering wife Lydia (Claire Price) seems stranded in her marriage to the pompous and hectoring Sebastian (Dominic Rowan) who – quite literally – cannot change a lightbulb without her assistance. When they are visited by successful American writer Mark (Daniel Abelson), who has always loved Lydia, the plot seems to promise a love triangle.But this play, written as part of a double bill in 1973, wrongfoots those expectations. It veers in several directions, from serious illness and impending death to father-son wrangles between Sebastian and Joey (Joe Edgar), who is an aspiring TV writer. Thrown into the mix is Lydia’s “outsider” status (she is Estonian) with talk of refugees as outsiders to “Englishness” along with the lived memories of the Holocaust, as well as political debates that set Sebastian’s champagne Marxism against Joey’s embrace of the Liberal party.The play was said to be loosely inspired by Rex Harrison and his last (sixth) wife, Kay Kendall, who died two years after they were married, in 1959.View image in fullscreenSimmering tension … Dominic Rowan and Daniel Abelson.Photograph: Ellie KurttzThe play creaks with female sacrifice that feels peculiarly of its time: Lydia lives in service to Sebastian, tending to his every need. And even when she suspects him of an affair, she still plans for his future welfare. Directed by Amelia Sears, the production does not try to disguise the datedness. This is a 1970s world of tiny black and white TV sets, drinks cabinets and dutiful wives.Staged fouryears before Rattigan died in 1977, it deals with impending death, but also the characteristic peering under the bonnet of a couple’s secrets; Lydia with her illness, Sebastian with an off-stage female lover who might well be the coded homosexual partner often found in Rattigan’s work.There is nervy humour and Price gives a delicate performance as Lydia, capturing the psychological subtleties of her part, while Rowan is sufficiently sledge-hammer as her boorish husband. Still, it is not as monumental a play asThe Deep Blue Sea, also about the disenchantments of romance, nor is it as chamber-like as some of Rattigan’s double-bills (such asSummer 1954). The parts of Joey and Mark feel like cogs to the plot, which itself is so busy that it dilutes emotional focus.But it is a tender work that leaves you with the picture of a family, fractious certainly, but loving too in their own way – and together until the end. Like so many Rattigan marriages, there are secrets and lies here but underneath there is a love that smoulders.AtOrange Tree theatre, London, until 5 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatreOrange Tree theatreTerence RattiganreviewsShareReuse this content"

At the beginning of the pandemic, we met at 5pm on Skype, Monday through Friday, which became our two-person book club. This continued after the pandemic. The first book we read was The Complete Stories by Elizabeth Bowen. Between that collection and The Hotel, my estimation is that we read between 80 and 120 books. Sometimes we marvelled with fake shivering (Muriel Spark’s The Driver’s Seat, for instance). Sometimes we compared our underlined parts in the books, and when we found we underlined the same adjective, the same phrase, or the same paragraph, we pretended, once again, to be surprised. When we read Henry Green’s novels, Edmund would act the dialogues out in a British accent. There was a detail from a Yasunari Kawabata novel that we returned to often as a private joke: “Are you low on B?” (As in Vitamin B.) “Yes, I feel low on B.” This would be the closest that we would admit that we were feeling saddened by the losses in our lives. Edmund lost many beloveds to Aids; I lost two children to suicide. And yet there was never a heaviness in our conversations. I think Edmund brought a lightness and a cloudlessness into my life. We gossiped, we giggled, and sometimes I would stare at my little screen, dumbfounded, when Edmund enlightened me with a graphic reminisce of gay sex from 20 or 30 years ago, in a castle or back alley in Europe. Then we would stare at each other before bursting into laughter.When we first read Bowen together, sometimes Edmund or I would say, “I wish I could write like this.” And the other person would repeat, “I wish I could write like this.” In a few days, I shall return to America where Edmund Valentine White III is no more, and I shall finish The Hotel by myself. Neither he nor I will make our friendship into fiction. I wish I knew a pair of characters like us in literature.‘He loved gossip and intrigue’Colm TóibínIrish novelistEdmund White wrote with style; he cared about style; he made it seem natural and effortless. He wrote and indeed spoke with a kind of delightful candour. He loved revelation and gossip and intrigue. The idea that everyone he knew had secrets fascinated him. He chuckled a lot. He read all the latest French novels. He saw no reason why he should keep things to himself and, because he was gay in a time when gay life had not appeared much in fiction, that became one of his great subjects.A Boy’s Own Story, which came out in 1982, had enormous influence. It was an essential book for several generations of gay men. In The Beautiful Room Is Empty and The Farewell Symphony, White charted the changes and the tragedies of the gay life that had seemed so promising in A Boy’s Own Story.In writing about gay characters, White also became one of the chroniclers of city life, especially New York and Paris. (During a brief stay in Princeton, he suggested that the only relief from tedium was to howl nightly at the moon.) White was in full possession of a prose style that was deceptive in how it functioned. His writing could feel like conversation or someone thinking clearly and honestly or taking you slowly into his confidence. The cadences were close to the rhythms of speaking, but there was also a mannered tone buried in the phrasing, which moved the diction to a level above the casual and the conversational.The book of his that I love most is his 2000 novelThe Married Man, which is a kind of retelling of Henry James’s The Ambassadors. White dramatises with considerable subtlety the conflict between the idea that the personal is political (“which,” White wrote in 2002, “may be America’s most salient contribution to the armamentarium of progressive politics”) and the legacy of Vichy France filled with secrecy and ambiguity and the ability to live several compartmentalised lives.In the recent years, White’s apartment in Chelsea, shared with his husband, the writer Michael Carroll, was a centre of fun and laughter, a place where you got all the latest news. Books were piled up. They, too, were treated as kind of news. He worked every day, writing at the dining-room table. He made light of his illness. He was, in many essential ways, a lesson to us all.‘I gave his novel a bad review – which positively inflamed his charm’Adam Mars-JonesBritish novelistI met Ed White in London in 1983, at the time of the UK publication of A Boy’s Own Story. I had reviewed the novel for Gay News, and he knew that my verdict was unfavourable but not what my objection was (I described it as a cake that had been iced but not baked). This didn’t deter him from making a conquest of some sort – a degree of resistance could positively inflame his charm. We took a stroll round Covent Garden. I bought him a punnet of whitecurrants, a fruit with which he was unfamiliar, though feigning ignorance in order to please me would have been perfectly in character. He must have registered my lack of carnal interest but went on sexualising our promenade, asking me if one bystander was my type, telling me that another had given me the eye.To have become his friend without even a moment of sexual closeness was, a least at that time in the New York gay world, an anomaly and perhaps even a distinction. I visited Ed several times in Paris, sleeping on the daybed in his enviable flat on the Île Saint-Louis. In the morning he would help his ex-lover John Purcell get ready for a day of graduate study, a routine – as he was well aware – with overtones of a mother packing her son off to school. We would have one more cup of coffee and listen to some chamber music, Poulenc a favourite. Then he would say, “I must get back to thedarlingnovel” (he was working on Caracole at the time), and lie on his bed to write in longhand. I loved those visits, and some of that was down to Paris, but most to his hospitality. For a night in he might buy rabbit loin in mustard sauce pre-prepared from atraîteur,unthinkable sophistication. It was from him I learned that “cutting the nose off the brie” was not just bad manners, as I hadn’t known, but a named crime.He was writing a monthly column for American Vogue, sosocialising was a job requirement as well as a pleasure. Even so, I was mildly scandalised that his French literary friends took it for granted that he would pick up the tab in restaurants.  Priggishly I would treat him to a meal now and then, though I think he took more pleasure in largesse than in the presumption of equality.‘He expanded the bounds of what could be written about’Olivia LaingBritish writerI saw Edmund White on the A train once, like glimpsing an emperor in the grocery shop. I must have been barely in my teens when I first read A Boy’s Own Story, the Picador paperback with the brooding boy in a purple vest on the cover. I was seduced by everything: the lovely, supple, almost shimmering language, the explicit precision applied to sex and class. Cornholing, a word I’d never heard before. Above all, it held out an invitation. It was from White that I realised a writer takes the rough material life gives – unwanted, shabby, maybe repellent – and makes it their own by way of sensibility and style, that alchemical translation.Years later, I met him. He was at an adjoining table when my first American editor took me out for lunch. He was celebrating too, toasting the publication of Justin Spring’s Secret Historian, a book about the unconventional sexual researcher Samuel Steward. It was pure White territory: sex explored exactly and without shame. His presence that day felt like a blessing. He interwove the elegant and the explicit, he expanded the bounds of what could be written about and also how a life could be lived. There is a generation of writers you write for without quite realising it. They set the bar, and then they go. That beautiful room is emptier now.‘His work was as fresh as gay bar gossip’MendezBritish novelistEdmund White was one of those writers whose work was as fresh and immediate as gay bar gossip, but from a place of deeper learning and knowledge. I met him once in 2019, over dinner with Alan Hollinghurst in New York, and he remained every bit as witty and sex-positive as I’d found him in his books. The incredible thing about him is that he was one of very few gay writers to remember the pre-Aids era and survive into old age. When I think of White I think of the bathhouses of 1970s New York City and his conspiratorial storytelling, though that’s not to undersell him as a prose stylist. Such was his keenness to connect with a gay-literate rather than a mainstream, almost anthropologically minded audience, that The Joy of Gay Sex, which he co-wrote, retains a contraband feel to this day.‘He showed us what was really going on’Tom CreweBritish novelistEdmund White was not a gateway to gay literature, or to the gay experience, since that would imply that he was not in himself a main destination. However, he was very often the man who opened the door to the expectant reader, who took them by the elbow, led them inside and eagerly showed them everything that was going on – that wasreallygoing on. There are his novels and his memoirs, of course, with their brave, bracing, dirty and dignifying candour, and his biographies, of Genet,Proust,Rimbaud, not to mention The Joy of Gay Sex, co-authored with Charles Silverstein. But I am thinking especially of States of Desire: Travels in Gay America (1980), which records his visits to the diverse gay communities across the country, before they were united by the internet and representation in mainstream culture. It is of its time – often magnificently so, as in its description of the “San Francisco look”:Edmund White on lust, love and literature: ‘I’d had sex with 3,000 men. A peer asked: “Why so few?”’Read moreA strongly marked mouth and swimming, soulful eyes (the effect of the moustache); a V-shaped torso by metonymy from the open V of the half-unbuttoned shirt above the sweaty chest; rounded buttocks squeezed in jeans, swelling out from the cinched-in waist, further emphasised by the charged erotic insignia of coloured handkerchiefs and keys; a crotch instantly accessible through the buttons (button one already undone) and enlarged by being pressed, along with the scrotum, to one side; legs moulded in perfect, powerful detail; the feet simplified, brutalised and magnified by the boots. For gay men there are three erotic zones – mouth, penis and anus – and all three are vividly dramatised by this costume.But it is also of its time in its repeated, inevitable attention to the brute facts of homophobia and how it crowds, limits and costs lives. The book, accidentally, became a vital record of gay life on the brink of Aids: the epidemic’s outsized impact in the US (which White went on to describe and protest) was a direct consequence of this indulged prejudice. But States of Desire doesn’t memorialise a lost Eden – “Gay life,” White said, “will never please an ideologue; it’s too untidy, too linked to the unpredictable vagaries of anarchic desire.” At one point in his travels, in Portland, he discovered “an unusual degree of integration with the straight community” worthy of remark: “A gay single or couple must deal with the family next door and the widow across the street; the proximity promotes a mixed gay-straight social life – parties, dinners, bridge games, a shared cup of coffee.” It’s a reminder of how amazingly far we’ve travelled. Edmund White was one of the people that brought us here – but he didn’t think integration and toleration, the right to marriage and a family, was an end-point. It was just one sight on the tour, and White showed us, with a proper absence of shame or embarrassment, many others rather more thrilling. Gay life shouldn’t ever mean one thing in particular; but what it can provide, as he wrote in States of Desire, “is some give in the social machine”.‘His books were a fabulous reel of anecdote and savage humour’Seán HewittEdmund White was true giant of letters, the patron saint of queer literature. I can still remember, vividly, reading (in the wrong order), the books of the trilogy from A Boy’s Own Story to The Farewell Symphony, completely absorbed in White’s camp, biting humour, his name-dropping, his ability to capture self-delusion, fantasy, disappointment, anger, lust and romance in a heady, whirling voice. I remember saying to a friend, then, that I thought I could read him for ever.White’s books were a fabulous, unending reel of anecdote and savage humour, attuned to the erotic impulse of writing, full of mincing queens, effeminate boys and brutal men: a fully stocked world of idolatry and abnegation. What stays with me, years later, is not only the biting social observation, but also the religious tenor of his mind, the affinities of his characters with the world of the sacred, of mystics and martyrs, which processed shame with such exuberance of feeling. I felt, in the company of his voice, educated in a secret, glamorous world, which was operatic in its emotion and brilliantly arch in its range of reference.In his final book,The Loves of My Life, White proved himself an iconoclast to the end. Even the epigraph made me chuckle, because I could almost hear him chuckling to himself while setting it down: “Mae West hearing a bad actress auditioning for West’s hit comedy Sex: ‘She’s flushin’ my play down the terlet!’”. His honesty, even in his last years, was still enough to make you wince, still sharp enough to bring a shock of laughter, still melancholy and occasionally self-pitying enough to catch you off guard with all the many sadnesses of the world. I’m grateful that he left us so much work, and that the full, unadulterated sound of his voice is so potent, so convivial, so fresh and living on every page.Explore more on these topicsEdmund WhiteLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Where would you go from here? It usually comes out with garbage, but sometimes there is something in it that gives you another idea.”The use of AI is a hugely contentious issue in the music industry.This year, Dua Lipa and Paul McCartney were among hundreds of artists whosigned an open letterurging the prime ministerto protect artists’ copyright and not “give our work away” to big tech.Ulvaeus said he believes AI is a collaborator rather than a creative threat.“It’s fantastic. It is such a great tool,” he added. “It is like having another songwriter in the room with a huge reference frame. It is really an extension of your mind. You have access to things that you didn’t think of before.”The new musical is far from Ulvaeus’s first flirtation with technology.Abba Voyage, the concert which launched three years ago in a purpose-built arena featuring digital avatars of the band members, has been a huge success and was described as a “dazzling retro-futurist extravaganza” by the Guardian.Thank you for the music: Abba members get Swedish knighthoodsRead moreIt was a risky venture as Pophouse Entertainment, the company behind the project needed to bring in £140m in order to break even.He told the audience at SXSW London that he embraced experimental approaches to songwriting and studio technology much earlier in his career.This experimental approach is characteristic of Ulvaeus’s career-long fascination with technological innovation.During his time inAbba, he – along with bandmate Benny Andersson – “always wanted the latest thing”, and were among the first to use the Minimoog synthesiser and to use digital recording machines in their studio.“We were always on the lookout for, you know, you would hear a sound on the record. How was that done? And then you get that stuff,” said.The Abba songwriter told the audience that he sees AI as the latest evolution in his career rather than a threat, which is how it is perceived by many.“I actually wake up curious every morning,” Ulvaeus said, explaining the drive that has kept him creating decades after Abba’s peak. “Everything’s really after our wanting to try new things.”Explore more on these topicsAbbaArtificial intelligence (AI)SXSWFestivalsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

He said: “The problems with my voice are one of many grounds for uncertainty about my creative future.” He said that he was currently unable to express himself with his voice: “I don’t feel like singing, and for me that’s a sign.”Bandmate Magne Furuholmen said all future band-related activities “will of course be tuned to suit Morten’s situation”.Harket broke the news on the A-ha website inan interview with band biographer Jan Omdahl. “I’ve got no problem accepting the diagnosis,” he said. “With time I’ve taken to heart my 94-year-old father’s attitude to the way the organism gradually surrenders: ‘I use whatever works.’”There is no current cure for Parkinson’s. In 2024, Harket underwent neurosurgery at the Mayo clinic in the US to implant electrodes inside the left side of his brain, followed by a similar procedure on the right side in December. The devices connect to a small device, similar to a pacemaker, placed under the skin of the upper chest that stimulates the brain by sending electrical impulses through the electrodes. The procedures gave him a dramatic improvement in his symptoms.Harket said: “I’m trying the best I can to prevent my entire system from going into decline. It’s a difficult balancing act between taking the medication and managing its side effects. There’s so much to weigh up when you’re emulating the masterful way the body handles every complex movement, or social matters and invitations, or day-to-day life in general.”A-ha: how we made Take on MeRead moreHarket said that he didn’t hope to regain “full technical control” over his vocals but that he had been working on songs “that I’ve got great belief in, and I feel the lyrics, especially, have something of a different aspect of me in them.“I’m not sure if I’ll be able to finish them for release. Time will tell if they make it. I really like the idea of just going for it, as a Parkinson’s patient and an artist, with something completely outside the box. It’s all up to me, I just have to get this out of the way first.”He told fans that his identity wasn’t rooted in being a singer. “I see singing as my responsibility, and at certain moments I think it’s absolutely fantastic that I get to do it. But I’ve got other passions too, I have other things that are just as big a part of me, that are just as necessary and true.”Furuholmen said in an Instagram post on Wednesday: “It is a day of sad news in A-ha world. Having known about Morten’s diagnosis for some time does not take the force out of the blow, nor diminish the impact it has had, and will continue have, on us – as people and as a band.”Furuholmen stressed the band’s compassion for Harket and his family and expressed gratitude for their memories, fandom and legacy.A-ha formed in Oslo in 1982, comprised of guitarist Paul Waaktaar-Savoy, keyboardist Furuholmen and lead singer Harket. The band has had nine Top 10 UK singles including Take on Me and You Are the One.Harket gave concerned fans a message about how to take the news: “Don’t worry about me. Find out who you want to be – a process that can be new each and every day. Be good servants of nature, the very basis of our existence, and care for the environment while it is still possible to do so. Spend your energy and effort addressing real problems, and know that I am being taken care of.”Explore more on these topicsA-haPop and rockNorwayParkinson's diseasenewsShareReuse this content"

It is so annoying to realise on a bathroom break, after pudding, that for the past two hours you have been unwittingly showing the remains of your starter with every smile.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.However. It is also undeniably the case that when someone does the right thing, letting you know that you might want to check a mirror, that moment can be awkward. Especially if you don’t know each other well, the spinach-eater might feel embarrassed and flustered and even, irrationally, a bit cross.To be clear, dear reader, you don’t have anything in your teeth that I am aware of. The point I am trying to establish is that if something about your look isn’t working, and you haven’t noticed, then a friend who points this out is doing the right thing. Right? Hold that thought.Now look down at your feet and ankles. Are you wearing white trainers with bare ankles?View image in fullscreenPairing dark grey socks with white black loafers.Photograph: Edward Berthelot/Getty ImagesFive years ago, white trainers and bare ankles, with either a midi-dress or an ankle-length jean, was a great look. But now, it makes you look dated. Next time you are out, look around you, and you will notice that no one under 30 wears this any more. It has become a very middle-aged look. The 21st-century equivalent of going out in a house coat. Now, there is absolutely nothing wrong with middle-age. I am in my 50s, and proud of it, and very much not about to start dressing like a teenager. But white trainers and bare ankles are not where style is at any more. I’m just trying to be helpful.The no-socks look has not yet disappeared. But then, people still wear fascinators to weddingsThis is all extremely discombobulating. It wasn’t that long ago that this look was cool. Phoebe Philo wore it. Rihanna wore it. Michelle Obama wore it. A flat white shoe with a flash of ankle was the definitive grown-up-but-still-got-it signoff, and it worked with any outfit. It was neat without being twee, casual but still elegant. But unless you’ve been hiding under a rock for the past year, you will have noticed the stratospheric rise of the sock. Generation Z love a sock. Socks – sporty, ribbed, marl, but very much designed to be seen – are where fashion is at. This has been bewildering to those of us who came of age in an era when the only acceptable socks were ones designed to make it look as if you weren’t wearing any.View image in fullscreenEmma Corrin outside Good Morning America in white tennis socks and patent brogues.Photograph: Media Punch/Bauer-Griffin/GC ImagesLet’s break this down. You can still wear a white trainer, but it will look more modern now if it’s a bit chunky. If you love a trainer with a neat profile, you can stick with the shape, but switch to colour. Either way, you need to wear socks. You can swap trainers for loafers, which have a similar silhouette to an old-school sleek trainer – but, yes, you guessed it, still socks. A bare ankle is just not cute.Am I exaggerating? A little, yes. The flat white and no-socks look has not yet disappeared. But then, people still wear fascinators to weddings and it doesn’t make them acceptable. The Duchess of Cambridge still wears white trainers and no socks with floral dresses, but a) to be fair, she’s probably had more pressing matters to contend with over the past year, and b) while she always looks charming, I’m not sure she’s exactly our north star here.

But this almost indestructible little creature gave me a lesson in resilienceAlex RileyWed 4 Jun 2025 01.55 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 07.19 EDTShareLess than a millimetre in length, the squishy, transparent animal was completely unaware of my presence, my entire existence, while I watched it in awe. On my computer screen, where I gazed at the image generated by a cheap USB microscope, the water bear stumbled over grains of eroded rock and plant matter, an assemblage of soil, and I felt amused by its bumbling nature. Like someone trying to move through a field of beach balls, I thought.I had found thiswater bear, or tardigrade, in a clump of moss I collected during a wet and windy walk with our dog, Bernie, in late 2021. After changing into dry clothes, I rinsed the moss with water and removed the excess using coffee filter paper. Transferring the residue soil and stray moss leaves – known as phyllids – to a small glass bowl, I found the water bear within minutes, but I don’t know how long I then spent watching the little animal manoeuvre through its microscopic kingdom. Time seemed to stand still, my eyes glued to the screen.View image in fullscreen‘Water bears can withstand the most brutal conditions without harm.’Photograph: Science Photo Library/Steve Gschmeissner/Getty ImagesI had been feeling overwhelmed about the state of the world: the climate crisis, ecological devastation, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and growing political toxicity. But my microscope was a portal into a life indifferent to humanity, oblivious to our often reckless actions.Water bears have existed in a similar form since the Cambrian period, a time when evolution came up with some of its most zany creations, such as the aptly namedHallucigeniathat had 10 tube-shaped legs and 14 punk rock-like spines along its back. Surviving through five mass extinctions, tardigrades are a small but charismatic reminder of life’s resilience through the ages.It’s heroic, hardy and less than a millimetre long: meet the 2025 invertebrate of the year  | Patrick BarkhamRead moreThe day before I found my first tardigrade, I had met with a researcher at the University of Plymouth who studied them for his PhD. Seeing his laboratory-reared animals inspired me to seek out my own. Finding one in the wild made me think of the early microscopists of the 17th century who first saw these animals – or “animalcules” as they called them – in the dirt collected from their gutters.Not only are tardigrades adorable, like sentient gummy bears with a pig-like snout for a mouth, they can withstand the most brutal conditions without harm. Blasted with radiation that would kill a human in seconds, heated to 130C or frozen to near-absolute zero (the temperature at which all motion, at the atomic level, ceases) – they endure. Their recent rise in popularity, especially in YouTube videos, has certainly come from their paradoxical mix of squishy cuteness and extreme indifference to stress.I also found comfort in this animal for a slightly different reason. Yes, being able to survive in space or being frozen solid is incredible. But these little animals are also unperturbed by the future planet we are creating. One studyfound they were unfazedby simulations of even the worst-case scenarios of climate change, a warming of 5C by 2100, which had “no detectable effect on the tardigrade community”.View image in fullscreenAlex Riley examining moss samples under the microscope.Photograph: Courtesy of Alex RileySeeing this creature for myself, knowing that it lived in my neighbourhood, felt like a balm against the age of extinction in which we are living.But I also felt a more personal kinship within this moment of observation: it was a reminder not just of the water bear’s ability to endure hardships, but of my own.As a boy growing up in a village in North Yorkshire, unable to understand my mum’s depression and her struggles with alcohol, I turned to nature as an escape from a confusing and often lonely home life. Shy and introverted, I found solace in scrapbooks, filling their pages with detailed descriptions of animals from distant lands, reminders of a living world far beyond the hills and valleys I roamed.My dad, who had worked in construction his whole life and stopped any scientific education before his O-levels, helped nurture my interests as best he could. Together, we built a pond from plywood and a plastic tarp, a portal into one of the most incredible metamorphoses in nature: a tadpole transforming into a frog. As I revised for my biology and chemistry exams, he would ask me questions from my notes and celebrate my answers, as if he was learning along with me, which he undoubtedly was.A moment that changed me: I went into the wilderness with my family – and lost my inhibitionsRead moreI was given an enormous amount of freedom to explore, to follow a path of my choosing. My mum, on her good days, always instilled a sense of “do what you enjoy”. My obsession with nature became a refuge, somewhere that was as much a part of myself as it was a tangible place I could run to.Since that first tardigrade, I have seen many others in the moss growing around my home. There are ones like the Michelin man, all segmented and chubby, and there are others with scutes of armour that remind me of a microscopic mashup of an armadillo and a woodlouse. All have the same chubby eight legs adorned with bear-like claws.Knowing that these tiny animals are all around has brought a dramatic shift in perspective; a walk into the garden feels like a reminder of life’s resilience, a journey from the alien world of the Cambrian to the future climate we are creating. A cushion of moss, just like the first one I collected, is the continued expression of a living planet.Super Natural: How Life Thrives in Impossible Places by Alex Riley is published by Atlantic Books on 5 June (£22).

It’s often argued that it’s not really worth saving food from the waste bin if energy or other ingredients are required, but I believe that all food is worth saving.We obviously need to cook and eat food every day, so why not reinvent dishes to include these otherwise unwanted ingredients? Zero waste at its simplest can also mean basic, innovative recipes and solutions for byproducts, such as today’s mango pit and skin coulis. Such recipes are an easier sell, because they simplify the concept and create a valuable product out of very little.Mango pit and skin coulisCoulis is a thin, smooth sauce that’s usually made from sieved fruit, and this one takes the flavour and residual flesh left on mango pits and skins and turns it into a restaurant-grade fruit sauce. When I first started cooking back in the late 1990s, chefs were putting a coulis of some kind on most puddings, and some still do but, to be fair, coulis is delicious and adds another dimension to a dish. Sweet, sour and flavoursome, with a smooth and silky texture, coulis is a simple and fun way to upcycle mango scraps, and shows how it’s well worth extracting the flavour from remnants and offcuts.It also exemplifies the principles I apply when developing food products and menu items for food businesses and restaurants: that is, minimising waste through creative repurposing, maximising flavour extraction from overlooked ingredients, and creating versatile new ingredients that can be incorporated into recipes or even developed into standalone products. What works in professional kitchens and product development often translates beautifully to home cooking – and vice versa – transforming forgotten and often discarded ingredients into something of genuine culinary value.I first had the idea for this coulis while developinga recipe for mango pit vodka, and it can be drizzled, stirred or shaken into countless drinks and desserts. It’s gorgeous diluted with sparkling water, in a smoothie or iced tea, shaken into a mango mojito or spooned over pancakes, porridge or, my personal favourite, yoghurt. The scraps from one mango typically yield about 100g of coulis, and the recipe below can be scaled up for as many mango pits and skins as you have to hand.Pit and skinof 1 ripe mango50g sugar, honey or jaggeryFinely grated zest and juice of ¼ lemon or lime(optional)Put the mango pit and skin in a small saucepan and add water just to cover. Add the sugar or honey (or jaggery, for an extra-flavoursome Indian twist) and the optional lemon or lime juice and zest. Bring to a boil, stirring gently, then turn down to a simmer and cook for 15–20 minutes, until the syrup is slightly thickened and the whole kitchen smells of mangoes.Leave to cool to room temperature, then strain through a fine sieve, rubbing any flesh off the pit and skin and pressing it through the sieve to extract every last bit – the remaining pit and skin can now be composted. Return the resulting coulis to the pan, bring back to a boil and reduce until it coats the back of a spoon or reaches your desired thickness. Store in a clean jar in the fridge for about five days, or portion and freeze.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteFruitDessertSauces and graviesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Think the comforting familiarity of terrine and steak tartare, of onion soup and moules-frîtes, the sheer pleasure that is a properParis-Brestor tarte tatin … In my home town of Lyon, we’ve even developed our own local take on the bistro in the form of thebouchon, to showcase and preserve the region’s culinary traditions. Bistro, bouchon, brasserie: whatever you call it, this is, above all else, good, honest cooking, rustic rather than show-offy, and it’s made to share around a noisy table, whether that’s in a restaurant or in the comfort of your own home.Lamb shoulder with flageolet beans (pictured top)Yes, there’s a fair amount of soaking, curing and marinading going on here, but it’s all well worth the effort – plus none of it requires much in the way of actual hands-on work, anyway.Prep20 minSoak24 hrCure6 hrMarinate12 hrCook5 hr 30 min+Serves4For the lamb1.2-1½kg bone-in lamb shoulder100g table salt1-1½ tsprosemary leaves1-1½ tspthyme leaves1 tsp finely chopped garlicVegetable oil, for searing4 cloves new season garlic, peeled, cut in half and germs removedAbout 1 litre lamb stockFor the marinade50ml extra-virgin olive oil½ tsp espelette pepper½ tsp paprika50ml vegetable oilFor the beans250g dried flageolet beans50g finely chopped shallot(about 6 tbsp)50g finely chopped celery(about 3-4 tbsp)10g finely chopped garlic(about 2 cloves)8-10bay leaves(5g)2-3 tsp thyme leaves(5g)1 litrechicken stockSaltSoak the dried beans in cold water for 24 hours. Meanwhile, put the lamb shoulder in a suitable dish in which it fits snugly, rub all over with the salt, rosemary, thyme and chopped garlic, then cover, refrigerate and leave to cure for six hours.Wash the cured lamb, then dry well with a clean tea towel or kitchen cloth. Heat a little vegetable oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan or casserole, then sear the lamb shoulder until well coloured all over. Make eight deep cuts all over the seared lamb and push the halved new-season garlic cloves into the slits. Put the lamb back in the same dish, add all the ingredients for the marinade, toss to coat, then cover again, return to the fridge and leave to marinate for 12 hours.Put the lamb and all its marinade in a large, cast-iron pot for which you have a lid, then pour in enough lamb stock to come halfway up the sides of the meat. Cover the pot and roast in a very low oven – 140C (120C fan)/300F/gas 1 – for five to six hours, until the lamb is very tender and all but falling off the bone. Take out of the oven and turn up the heat to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Baste the lamb in the pan juices until it’s well coated, then return to the oven uncovered for another 15 minutes, basting regularly with the pan juices, until the liquid reduces and the lamb is nicely browned and glazed.After the lamb has been cooking for three to three and a half hours, drain the soaked beans and put them in an oven tray (ideally one for which you have a lid). Add the shallot, celery, garlic, bay and thyme, pour over the chicken stock, cover the tray (either with a lid or a thick double layer of foil) and bake alongside the lamb for 90 minutes. After the beans have had 45 minutes, season with salt, stir and finish off cooking. Just before serving, adjust the seasoning to taste.Spoon the cooked beans on to a big platter and top with the lamb, either carved or whole to be carved at the table. Spoon over a generous amount of the cooking juices, take to the table and serve. A few new season carrots and/or some cabbage on the side wouldn’t go amiss, either.Rum babaView image in fullscreenAt the restaurant, we make our babas in large traditionalkugelhopfmoulds, but at home you could also make individual ones in a six- or eight-hole muffin tin.Prep10 minProve1 hrCook2 hr 15 minServes10For the quick marmalade2 large oranges200g caster sugar30g lemon juiceFor the rum syrup750g caster sugar375ml dark rumFor the chantilly100ml double cream100ml whipping cream1 vanilla pod, split lengthways and seeds scraped out and reserved40g caster sugarFor the baba7g fast-action yeast, or 15g fresh yeast160g beaten egg(from about 3-4 eggs)250g strong white bread flour7g salt20g sugar50g unsalted butter, melted, plus extra softened butter for greasingFor the orange and rum glaze200g orange marmalade(see above and method)30ml dark rumFirst make the quick marmalade. Using a small, sharp knife or peeler, peel the oranges, taking care not to take off too much of the white pith, then cut the skin into fine julienne strips. Pare off and discard the pith from the oranges, then segment the orange flesh. Put the peel in a small saucepan of water, bring to a boil, then fine-strain. Return the peel to the pan, cover with fresh water and repeat the process twice more. After the third strain, put the orange peel back in the pan, add the orange segments, sugar and 420ml cold water, and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer, and leave to cook for about 45 minutes, until thick, sticky and jammy. Take off the heat, stir in the lemon juice and leave to cool.Now for the glaze. Once the marmalade is cool, measure 200g of the cooled marmalade into a small pan, add the rum and bring to a simmer. Strain to remove the solids, then set aside.Put all the ingredients for the chantilly cream in a clean bowl, whisk to soft peaks, then cover and refrigerate until needed.Now for the baba itself. Heat 90ml water to 28C (just above room temperature), then stir in the yeast. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment or with a hand whisk, beat the egg with the flour, salt and sugar, then beat in the yeast mixuntil well combined. Swap the whisk for the dough hook (or a wooden spoon) and mix on medium speed for five minutes, or until the dough comes together and starts to get stretchy.Slowly incorporate the melted butter, and mix until the dough is smooth.Grease a 24cm kugelhopf tin (or a six- or eight-hole muffin tin) with softened butter, scrape in the baba mix, cover with a damp cloth or clingfilm,and leave to prove at room temperature for an hour, or until it’s risen to 2cm from the top of mould. Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, then bake for about 40 minutes (or for eight to 10 minutes if making baby babas), until nicely browned and a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean.Remove from the oven, unmould at once on to a rack, then leave to cool for 10 minutes.While the baba is baking, make the syrup. Put the sugar and rum in a medium saucepan with 750ml water, bring to a simmer, then leave to cool to lukewarm (40C). Slowly pour syrup all over the baba, letting it soak in first before adding any more, until it’s fully soaked all the way through, then put on a rack to cool.Once the baba is completely cool, brush it all over with the orange and rum glaze, then slice and serve with the chantilly cream.Claude Bosi is chef/patron ofJoséphine,Brooklands at the PeninsulaandBibendum, all in London.Explore more on these topicsFrench food and drinkSummer food and drinkFoodLambMeatBeans, pulses and legumesMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

While beauty buffs use melting balms, silky oils and rich creams to remove daily makeup, dirt and SPF, and separate exfoliants to remove dull skin, the vast majority of consumers – including my own family – will always prefer a foaming face wash that does it all.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I get it. Exfoliating cleansers are fast to use (and easily stored in the shower), and give that fully refreshed feeling only wet cleansing can. The drawback is that they can leave your face feeling tight, dry and begging for moisturiser, and frequently fail what I call “the towel test” – that is, they leave behind enough makeup for it to lightly stain a white towel during post-cleanse drying. So which exfoliating cleansers do a decent job and leave skin clean, without too much squeak?For oily and spotty skin, I frequently recommend CeraVe’sSASmoothing Cleanserwith salicylic acid (£14.50), since the beta hydroxy acids cut through oiliness without leaving skin parched, thanks to comforting ceramides.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Avoid summer meltdowns with new long-wear makeupRead moreOn dull, drier skin, I love the always excellent Skingredients’ new (refillable)AHA Brightening + Exfoliating Lactic Acid Cleanse(£28, pictured). This recommendation is a bit of a cheat, since the product doesn’t foam, but it rinses off with water (leave on for 60 seconds before doing so, for best results), cleanses properly and gives face-wash fans that very clean, fresh feeling they crave. The lactic acid (my exfoliant of choice) here is gentler than other alpha hydroxy acids and its moisturising abilities help ease that tight, dry sensation. Slot this one in place of your usual cleanser a couple of times a week.Also using lactic acid for brightness and smoothness is Simple’sSmoothing Gel Cleanser For Sensitive Skin(£9). This is an impressive product from a brand that has raised its game considerably over the past two or three years. It removed all but my eye makeup (clear that with micellar lotion before turning on the tap), rinsing away quickly and easily, leaving no residue and only very mild tightness (unavoidable on drier skins).To those who find even a separate wash for face a step too far, I offer Beauty Pie’sAcidEnzyme Jumbo Exfoliating Face & Body Cleanser(£28.50 to members) for a massive 400ml pump bottle. My family is mad for this unfragranced, easily rinsed, sudsing wash that helps clears pores and mild acne, whether it’s on the face, chest or back.Explore more on these topicsBeautySali Hughes on beautySkincareHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was at junior school. I had a friend whose mother was described as “vague” – this was the 1970s, so that could have been code for almost anything. The vague mother had given my normally quite organised mother directions to a remote house where my schoolfriend spent his summers. We were “popping in” (70s code: spending the day there). The instructions to find the place were something like, “Turn left after South Zeal, pass the dirt track and follow the direction the sheep are facing.”After an hour of pretending we were still on the right route, my mum suddenly burst into tears and uttered a rare denunciation of a fellow human being. “That SILLY woman!” she shouted. “We don’t know where we are. Nobody does.”Were we not just lost, but lost-lost, in the way that leads to humans sometimes disappearing for ever? “Nobody does” sounded serious to this 10-year-old. There were no mobile phones and, this being the olden days, only a large spiral-bound map of the entire country in the footwell of the car (at this stage, a gen Z reader will be saying: “Nah. That never happened”). We were, I suspect, on Dartmoor.View image in fullscreenJeremy Vine on the beach with his daughters Martha, left, and Anna, when they were youngMy mum pulled herself together and eventually the tears were dried, new purpose found, her boy reassured, the house somehow located. But for many years the word “Devon” was synonymous in my mind with “lost and weeping”. It was not a place you go to by choice. Nobody does.But 25 years later I did return. In a sense there was no choice; the location came with my lovely fiancee Rachel Schofield. Her parents had retired to a sprawling house near Sidmouth. It had a cobwebbed pantry and service bells for long-dead maids. They suggested a marquee in their back garden on the wedding day. I was hardly about to reply: “Have you thought of Hammersmith?”Not lost, this time, but found. We were married in the church of St John the Evangelist in Tipton St John. My mum cried again, but for different reasons. Over the years we came down summer after summer, Christmas after Christmas, for R&R in the muddy Devon air. Our two kids arrived. It became their go-to bucket-and-spade location: I recently heard a psychologist explain how a regular family holiday location is “good for children’s mental health”, and wondered why she never mentioned adults.View image in fullscreenThe Jurassic coast at Branscombe.Photograph: MH Coast/AlamyThere are some great spots around that part of the east Devon coast. You can see the full glory of the Jurassic Coast in Seaton, and gasp at the fact that Jurassic means “ 200m years ago”. There are almost-private beaches too (just don’t picnic in the shade of the rock face – I never trust a bit above me not to break off and I don’t want to be killed by the Mesozoic era). You can go to arcades in Exmouth, not quite Jurassic but still wonderfully old-fashioned. Play the penny falls and the impossible lucky dip. Or visit the“Excape” roomthere, set up and run by the most lovely young couple you will ever meet.At Branscombe beach you can see the place where, in 2007, the so-called “scavengers of Branscombe” descended. A freighter shed its cargo, the goods were washed on to the normally deserted beach, and about £1m-worth of cars, motorbikes, spare parts, bric-a-brac and countless items of treasure trove were liberated by people who came from all over the country. Newspapers called it the “Branscombe beach booty bonanza”.Sidmouth is chintzy in places, drab in others, but it feels real. And real by the sea is a different kind of beautyThere I go again, letting my news head take over. Devon is a place to leave the real world behind. Walk from Axmouth to Lyme Regis if you want the coastal path. Go to Budleigh Salterton if you love a cliff and you don’t mind pebbles (use sea shoes and a wetsuit, and suddenly you have Bondi beach in Budleigh). Go to the village of Beer forPecoramaif you have young ones; their model railway takes humans. Ottery St Mary hasWildwoodwildlife park and its drop slide, the most inspiring challenge to health and safety law I’ve seen this century. If you want pure walking,Newton Poppleford to Budleigh Saltertonis six miles.Seaton Wetlandshas three miles of trails. Or just walk in a circle round Colyton.But it’s Sidmouth I come back to. After getting married close by, it became our summer place. It has sights such asJacob’s Ladderhistoric wooden steps, the supersize-me cakes at theClock Tower cafeor the famousDonkey Sanctuary, probably one of the most popular charities on the face of the Earth. It’s not a classic sandy beach – a single triangle of brown sand is revealed at low tide, and that’s your lot – but you feel you’re facing proper sea, with heavy weather triggering waves that crash against rocks by the promenade. When I set my first whodunnit, Murder on Line One,in the town, I included a scene in chapter two where a massive wave sweeps the radio station manager and her just-sacked DJ into the water together. He has to rescue her, fishing her out of the sea after she kicked him out of his job.View image in fullscreenJeremy Vine and his daughtersWhat I love most about Sidmouth is that it feels like a town going places. It was once cruelly nicknamed “God’s waiting room”. But recently Radio 2 had to cover a story about a giant lump of congealed fat, wet wipes and dental floss that had blocked the sewers. “It is the size,” we were told, “of two doubledecker buses.” It was sucked out using some sort of reverse fire hose. Others despaired, but I felt this was Sidmouth laying down a marker. It had a bigger blob of fat than Blackpool. More families, more jobs, more going on (and going down). It’s chintzy in places, drab in others, but it feels real. And real by the sea is a different kind of beauty. Brits need proximity to the ocean. In Sidmouth you’re virtually in it.Jeremy Vine’s debutmystery, Murder on Line One (HarperCollins, £20), is out now.To support the Guardian order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Just a normal rag doll. Nothing to see here.If there’s nothing to see, why are we talking about her?Because there happened to bea large fire and a jailbreak in New Orleanswhile “one of the most infamous dolls on the planet” was in town. Reports of Annabelle going missing and causing “local disasters” while on tour in May have been proliferating online. Chicago was bracing itself last week after rumours she was coming for them next.Hang on, hang on. “Infamous”? “Disasters”? Explain yourself.Annabelle is haunted, probablycursed. Given to a Connecticut nurse in 1970, she soon started moving around, leaving notes and inflicting “psychic slashes” on visitors.Passive-aggressive, huh? I’ve had roommates like that.Well, the paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren concluded Annabelle was demonically possessed and removed her to their museum. “Allegedly linked to decades of deaths and grisly paranormal activity,”according to NBC, she has subsequently inspired three films in The Conjuringhorror franchise (Annabelle, Annabelle: Creation and Annabelle Comes Home).I like the “allegedly” there, as if shemay be litigious.Look at her: she’d absolutely take you to the cleaners.So this Annabelle doll recently went walkabout and bad stuff happened?According to the New England Society for Psychic Research, who organised her tour (called Devils on the Run), Annabelle didnotgo missing in New Orleans, and she was never in Chicago at all. “That doll was never out of our sight, never out of our control,” her handler, Tony Spera, confirmed. She remained in her case, which is “usually secured by crosses and holy water”.It’s fake news, then?Or possibly viral marketing, but social media users aren’t buying it. “Ed and Lorraine told y’all to keep her locked up,” one wrote on theFacebook page for Ghost City Tours, which hosted Annabelle in New Orleans. “Nobody listened. Look at the aftermath.” TikTok users freaked out at the idea she was missing, and questioned why Annabelle was “on tour” at all: “Is she about to drop her first single, I love Satan and killing babies???”The queen of evil dolls: why Annabelle’s work ethic makes her a great role modelRead moreThis is just silly, isn’t it? Haunted dolls aren’t real.Ebay users would beg to differ: there’s abuoyant marketfor them, everything from “positive, beginner-friendly”GemmatoVicky, “a particularly horrid spirit” who hides the TV remote and “doesn’t like men at all”.Again, I’ve had roommates like that.There are other celebrity haunted dolls, too: sailor-suitedRobert, who lives in Florida and inflicts “post-visit misfortunes” on disrespectful guests; andOkiku, who is possessed by a dead child and has hair that keeps growing. But Annabelle is the most powerful and we should respect her.Annabelle’s making you say that, isn’t she?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Surface Laptop 13in joins the current seventh-generation Laptop 13.8in and 15in that were launched in the summer last year. It sits at the bottom of the premium pile in price, costing from £899 (€1,099/$900/A$1,699), but above the Laptop Go 3, which is likely to be phased out.The new 13in model looks like a cross between theLaptop Goand its bigger siblings. It has a similar but smaller glossy LCD touchscreen, which isn’t quite as bright or crisp and has a slower 60Hz refresh rate, but still looks good for the size. The smooth aluminium deck holds a full-size keyboard that offers a quality typing experience few competitors manage.View image in fullscreenThe power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe generous trackpad is smooth and precise but of the older, hinged variety, instead of the better haptic models fitted to the larger Surface Laptop models and other premium competitors. It still works fine but is harder to click higher up on the pad.The speakers in the deck are great for the size and the 1080p webcam above the screen is solid, even if it lacks Microsoft’sWindowsHello facial recognition for logging into the machine.SpecificationsScreen:13in LCD 1920 x 1280 (178 PPI)Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus (8 core)RAM:16GBStorage:256 or 512GBOperating system:Windows 11HomeCamera:1080P front-facingConnectivity:wifi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, USB-A, 2xUSB-C (3.2), headphonesDimensions:285.7 x 214.1 x 15.6mmWeight:1.2kgSnapdragon X PlusView image in fullscreenThe laptop takes about two hours to fully charge using a 60W or greater power adaptor (not included), hitting 50% in 36 minutes.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Laptop 13in has Qualcomm’s mid-rangeSnapdragon X PlusArm chip with eight cores (versus 10 on the larger models). It won’t win any raw performance awards but it is roughly on a par with its Intel competition and plenty fast enough for a laptop of this size. It stays quiet unless really pushed and feels snappy in operation while managing to be efficient on battery for general use. It lasts a very good 14 hours of work using plenty of browser tabs, multiple chat apps, text editors and note-taking apps. That is almost twice as long as previousIntel-based Surface Laptopsand much more on a par withApple’s class-leading MacBook Air.Using it for more demanding tasks, such as large photo editing or other creative applications, cuts the battery life roughly in half for a still solid seven hours.The Surface has two USB-C (3.2) ports and a USB-A port, which is reasonably good for a machine of this size. But it lacks the more modern USB4/Thunderbolt and ditches Microsoft’s proprietary Surface Connect port, relying instead on USB-C for charging, which is no bad thing unless you already own a Surface Dock or similar accessory.Windows 11 on ArmView image in fullscreenRecall allows you to go back in time to see what you were looking at in various apps using a timeline or search.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Surface runs Windows 11, which generally works well without any unnecessary trials and bits of software that frequently plague rivals. But Windows on Arm chips, such as the Surface’s Snapdragon models, still has a few compatibility problems not shared by the version running on the standard x86 chips from Intel or AMD.Apps that aren’t written for Arm systems have to be run through an emulation system, which works in the background but makes them much slower. Lighter-weight x86 apps, such as the note-taker Evernote, work OK but are noticeably slower than on Arm-native rivals.The majority of popular apps now have Arm versions, which fly along. That includes Google Drive, whichuntil recentlywas incompatible with Windows on Arm. But there are enough apps with issues, particularly in the creative industries, that you should check for problems before buying. Gaming is also tricky, as most big games including Fortnite are not compatible with Arm chips.View image in fullscreenCopilot in the Edge browser allows you to ask questions about the site you’re currently looking at instead of heading to a Google search.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe laptop is aCopilot+PCand includes Microsoft’s various AI tools. The much-delayedRecall featurerecords snapshots of what you’re doing on the machine so you can use it like a time machine to see what was on screen at any particular moment. You can search Recall using natural language and interact with the text, images or data it finds, such as opening a site you were browsing a couple of days ago.It is an opt-in feature, the screenshots are stored locally on your device secured by your fingerprint, and you can block some apps from being captured, such as a password manager, but it could still be a privacy risk too far for some.The rest of the AI tools are similar to those onprevious Surfaces, including a Cocreator system in Paint that can turn crude sketches into art. The most powerful tool is Copilot, which is integrated across multiple Microsoft apps, including Word and other members of the Office suite if you have a subscription. Generally it works as a cross between a search tool and an AI chatbot, and makes short work of turning data into tables, jazzing up your copy or identifying things from images, though you have to use Microsoft’s Edge browser for it to be able to see what you’re looking at on your screen.View image in fullscreenClick to Do is a new fast way of interacting with images, objects and text on your screen.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianMicrosoft’s new “Click to Do” feature allows you to hold the Windows button and click on something on your screen to perform actions with it, such as remove an image’s background with Paint or rewrite the text with AI. It is fairly basic at the moment, with more features to be added later this year, but it works as a much quicker and accessible way of performing AI tasks with things on a PC.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe smooth aluminium lid looks and feels premium, particularly in its violet colour option.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe laptop is generally repairable, with areplaceable SSD, spare parts,self-repairandservice guidesavailable. The machine contains recycled cobalt and rare earth metals. Microsoft operatestrade-in and recycling schemesand publishesout-of-warranty repair costsandproduct environmental impact reports.PriceThe Microsoft Surface Laptop 13in costs from£899(€1,099/$899.99/A$1,699) and ships on 10 June.For comparison, the Surface Laptop 13.8in costs from£944, the Surface Pro 12in costs£799, theSurface Pro 13incosts£1,029and the13in MacBook Air M4costs£999.VerdictThe Surface Laptop 13in is a smaller, cut-down version of Microsoft’s excellent Windows 11 laptop.The general feel of the machine is very similar to its larger siblings thanks to premium materials, a great keyboard and clutter-free Windows 11 experience. The 13in touchscreen is decent, if not quite as good as other models, and the older-technology trackpad still works well. Microsoft’s AI tools are slowly improving, though they are still not a reason to buy a machine.The lack of USB4/Thunderbolt and face recognition can be overlooked for a cheaper price, as can the lower-power chip. It proved more than fast enough for general productivity, and helps provide long battery life that could see out two full work days between charges. The Arm chip brings with it some potential app compatibility problems that are worth checking out before buying.Overall, the small Surface Laptop is a lovely machine. But at £900 or equivalent it’s not terribly cheap, with its larger and better sibling often available for similar money, so it’s worth shopping around.Pros:good keyboard, decent trackpad, good speakers, USB-A and USB-C, decent screen, fingerprint reader, long battery life, solid performance, clutter-free Windows 11 with AI features.Cons:app and game compatibility issues with Arm chip, screen only 60Hz and less crisp than larger siblings, no face recognition, no USB4, no haptic touchpad, a little expensive.View image in fullscreenSleek design and premium materials help elevate the Surface Laptop from the pack.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsMicrosoft SurfaceMicrosoftLaptopsComputingWindows 11WindowsreviewsShareReuse this content"

His quote-unquote ‘solutions’ will only make a bad situation worse.”View image in fullscreenBernie Sanders.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianIn person, Sanders’ 83 years read differently than in photograph, perhaps because of how conversational he is. His voice is magnetic – a Brooklyn accent that feels both warm and tough. “But what I have been aware of, and I’ve talked about it for years, is that in America, the very richest people are doing phenomenally well, while 60% of our people live paycheck to paycheck.”Later, he will say the same thing to an audience in London – only with more emphasis and passion. “Sixty per cent. Six-zero. Do you know what paycheck to paycheck means?” It’s exhilarating to hear Sanders speak to a crowd: his zeal is reflected back in their faces, his moral clarity is such a relief, set against the cynicism and resignation of most of the Democratic party’s opposition to Trump and his administration. Class war is as old as time, but it’s a peculiarity of this age that you rarely hear a politician name it. “I do,” he tells me. “There is a class war going on. The people on top are waging that war.”It’s a look at what could have been. Sanders ran, of course, to be the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, and again in 2020. The first time, there was a real sense, in the US and abroad, that something incredible might happen: that someone with “almost no name recognition,” he says, a senator from the small state of Vermont, might successfully challengeHillary Clinton, whom the party had already anointed. We all know how that worked out. Was it the greatest disappointment of his political life? “Well, you’re too busy to feel things,” he says. “You’re just working very hard.”What is absolutely unequivocal is his criticism of theDemocrats. The party, he thinks, lacks any real progressive promise. “What they say is, ‘The status quo is working pretty good, and we will tinker around the edges’, and that is not a message that resonates with working people”. He refuses to indulge in any personal ill-will towards Joe Biden or Kamala Harris. The most he’ll voice is a weary resignation about 2020, when his campaign “won the first three states, primary states, in terms of popular votes. Then the Democratic establishment made sure the other candidates dropped out, and they rallied around Joe Biden. You know, that’s the world that we live in. We are taking on not just the Republican leadership, we are taking on a Democratic establishment which is tied to elements of corporate America.”During the 2024 election, he “worked very hard to see that Kamala Harris was elected. I was all over the country and was one of her major surrogates. We begged our campaign to start talking about the needs of working people. But their consultants and the money people behind them thought of another strategy, showing that she was more conservative, that she worked with people likeLiz Cheney, worked with Republicans, had billionaires going out and saying that she’s wonderful. They thought that was the right approach. I did not think that was the approach, and I was public about that.” He pauses, and not for effect: it’s hard to relive November 2024. “But my voice did not carry,” he says.Sanders started his political life in 1981, when he was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont. His brother, Larry, is 90 and lives in Oxfordshire. He stood as a Green candidate in David Cameron’s old parliamentary seat in 2016. In a speech that year, supporting Sanders as the Democratic nominee, Larry gave a brief portrait of their parents. “Eli Sanders and Dorothy Wexford Sanders. They did not have easy lives, and they died young,” he said. Dorothy was born in New York, to Jewish immigrant parents fleeing Russian pogroms. Eli arrived in the US in 1921, most of his family remaining in what is now Poland and what was then Austrian Galicia, to be “wiped out by Hitler,” Sanders has said in the past. Eli worried constantly about providing for his family and both he and Dorothy were political, Larry said in the speech: “They loved the New Deal of Franklin D Roosevelt, and would be especially proud that Bernard is renewing that vision.”View image in fullscreenSanders speaks in support of better healthcare provision in Washington DC, 2023.Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesSanders’ charge to the Democrats now is twofold. “Their weakness is, I think, that their credibility is now quite low. And they don’t have much of a message for working people, other than to say Trump is dangerous. I think that’s just not enough.” He point blank refuses to get into Trump’s administration – its excesses, surprises, non-surprises, without first walking through everything that was already wrong with the US. “What the Democrats have to absolutely make clear is this: we’re going to take on the billionaire class. They’re going to start paying their fair share of taxes. We’re going to havehealthcare for all peopleas a human right. We’re going to have a strong childcare system that every American can afford. We’re going to make public colleges and universitiestuition-free. We’re going to create millions of jobs transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel. We’re going to build housing – boy, housing is like it is here, justa huge crisis. We’re going to build millions of units of low-income and affordable housing. Do Democrats say that? No.”That Sanders will not be drawn on every new Trump calumny, instead focusing on an economic reality that’s been worsening for decades, does help him keep on course. And it definitely doesn’t stop him giving Trump both barrels. “We don’t usually have presidents suing the media, threatening the media if they write bad stories about them. We don’t usually have presidents threatening to impeach judges. We don’t have presidents suing law firms. You add all that together, it is a movement for authoritarianism.” Is it worse than he predicted? I was thinking specifically about the extrajudicial detentions and deportations, students dragged off campus and held for weeks, perfectly legal migrants sent to El Salvador, when they weren’t even from there. “First time around, Trump was not as well organised. They’ve had four years to get their act together, so to speak. And that’s what this Project 2025 document was about.”Project 2025 was adocumentpublished by rightwing thinktank the Heritage Foundation in 2024, offering aterrifying vision for a second Trump term. An outright proposal to dismantle the US government, it was a roadmap to crackdown on immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, abortion rights – as well as being against action on the climate crisis and against vaccines. If it looked like a blueprint for The Handmaid’s Tale and The Road combined, none of the alarm last year could ever have encompassed the reality that would come. Among many other things, the Trump administration would go on to deport people without due process, and then ignore a supreme court ruling that an 18th-century wartime declaration about “alien enemies” was not a proper legal instrument.The Democrats’ credibility is quite low. They don’t have much of a message for working peopleI ask a question about who funds the Heritage Foundation – as it keeps all donations secret, which raises questions about whose interests Project 2025 is really serving. His reply is impatient: “It doesn’t matter who it is they have. There’s no lack of well-paid, right-wing consultants and intellectuals who can move this country to an oligarchic authoritarian society.” His tone is clear – stop getting lost in detail, stop looking for hidden connections, stop messing around and start fighting.“One of the frightening aspects of what’s going on is the degree to which the establishment-type folks have caved in, and so quickly,” he says. “That was much less the case, during Trump’s first term.” He mentions Jeff Bezos, “who one had assumed was kind of a moderate Democrat”, losing his editorial board because they were going to endorse Kamala Harris. “Same thing in the Los Angeles Times. When you have ABC agreeing to a settlement with Trump; the bogus lawsuit against CBS thatParamount are negotiatingright now. When you have major, billion-dollar law firms saying, ‘OK, we plead guilty to having clients who went to court against you and your friends, that was a terrible crime, we’re going to give you millions of dollars.’ Harvard has buckled up a little bit and appears not to be caving in, but a lot of universities have. None of this was the case eight years ago. They are creating the overall mentality that it will be dangerous to be strongly critical of Donald Trump.”View image in fullscreenWith Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a rally in Denver, Colorado, in March.Photograph: Chet Strange/Getty ImagesIn other areas, money is talking so loudly in politics that it’s all you can hear. Sandershas used Gaza as an examplewhen he says that politicians are afraid to speak out on Israel’s actions in caseSuper Pacs– which can put forward unlimited amounts of money for a candidate – will penalise them at the next election. Today, he says it’s not just Gaza, but a host of other issues. “Ifyou say, ‘Do you really think it’s a good idea to cut Medicaid and give tax breaks to billionaires? Do you really think that climate change is a hoax?” there will be a number, not a majority, but a number of Republicans who would say: ‘No. But if I stand up and vote ‘no’, the next day, Elon Musk would say, “All right, you are going to be primaried [a candidate will be fielded against you], and Trump will support your opponent. I will put unlimited sums of money to elect your opponent.”’ Good luck to you.’”While that pattern is undoubtedly visible across many issues, the example of Gaza is particularly stark – with groups such asAipac, funded by pro-Israel billionaires, putting tens of millions of dollars against congressional candidates, mainly Democrats, that it did not deem to be sufficiently supportive of Israel in the run-up to 2024. As the atrocities inGazaleave many in civil society dumbfounded, what is the long game here, I ask. “That’s a difficult question, and I don’t know the answer. I will tell you that the United States has had a long-term relationship with Israel, and there are many people who have intellectually chosen not to understand that Netanyahu does not represent the Israel of 20 years ago. The moderate democratic society is now controlled by right-wing racist extremists who have done, and are doing today, absolutely horrific things to the Palestinian people in violation of American law and international law. They refuse to recognise that.” In Dublin, he was heckled for not using the word genocide, and some US progressives were dismayed, two years ago, whenhe didn’t call for an immediate ceasefire. He speaks out now, choosing his words carefully; he’s not on the fence.Since the end of March, Sanders andAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez(he always calls her that, never AOC), have been holding campaign rallies all over the US from Arizona to Utah. They are deliberately not skipping the diehard Democratic states – but have been more surprised by the numbers they’ve been getting in red states. “This is not a campaign. This is a political rally, and I think the numbers are almost unprecedented. Large numbers of people, including in conservative areas, do not want to see oligarchy in America, do not want to see authoritarianism, do not want to see massive tax breaks for the rich and cuts to the programmes that working-class people desperately need.” Sure, he and AOC sometimes disagree, “my wife and I disagree on issues! But Alexandria, I think, comes pretty much from where I come from.”View image in fullscreenBernie Sanders as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in the 1980s.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveHe has hope for the future, too. There are a couple of dozen people in the house Progressive Caucus – a 98-strong group of the more left-wing members of the Democratic party in Congress – that are “strong progressives”, he says. “Alexandria is maybe one of the most articulate and charismatic, but there are others there as well.”Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib to name a few.Sanders is clear that he and Ocasio-Cortez are not trying to start a third political party. Instead, they’re “trying to build a grassroots movement of working-class people and young people … If you’re seeing candidates now arising who are progressive, that’s down to a lot of the work that we are doing for the 2026 midterms.”Sanders in person is very much as he is in his book,It’s OK to Be Angry About Capitalism, in which he lays out some principles, among them, “wars and excessive military budgets are not good”; “carbon emissions are not good”; “racism, sexism, homophobia and xenophobia are not good”; “exploiting workers is not good”. It’s really the sight of him igniting a crowd that’s so hopeful, which holds for him, too – he keeps his optimism because he has the “fortune of being able to go around the country and speak to large numbers of wonderful people”. The message doesn’t change, though – it doesn’t have to be new: it just has to be true.As he leaves to make his way upstairs to the photography studio, he strides on ahead, his wife Jane O’Meara Sanders, an activist herself, making small talk with me in his wake. It’s not that he’s performing vigour in an era where politicians’ ages are relentlessly analysed. It’s just his manner – all this urgent change should have happened yesterday.This article was amended on 4 June 2025. An earlier version misspelled the surname of Jane O’Meara Sanders as “Saunders”."

It is the softcore erotic drama from screenwriter Joe Eszterhas and director Paul Verhoeven that has made a slow ascent from critical flop to kitsch cult favourite and now to a supposed tongue-out-of-cheek classic melodrama. Maybe it’s the last great mainstream exploitation picture, a film which owns and flaunts its crassness; a bi-curious catfight version of All About Eve or Pretty Woman.Elizabeth Berkley plays Nomi, a mysterious, beautiful, super-sexy drifter who arrives in Vegas, hoping to make it dancing in one of the hotel shows. She is befriended by Molly (Gina Ravera), a good-natured pal whose help gets Nomi a start in a low-grade strip joint called Cheetah’s. Nomi soon upgrades to the supposedly classier Stardust where she is dazzled by the gorgeousness of leading lady Cristal Connors, played by Gina Gershon with an entirely ridiculous way of addressing everyone as “darlin’” in a Texas accent. Nomi has a sexual frisson with the club’s owner Zack, played byKyle MacLachlan(whose presence helps give the film a mild and accidental Lynchian flavour) and also with Cristal herself, whose understudy she aspires to be. Throughout it all, Nomi shows she is a survivor with a streak of ruthlessness.The question has to be asked. Why? Why? Why the strange, clenched, maniacal acting and directing, which Verhoeven never actually demonstrated before or ever again, and which really doesn’t resemble any other 90s erotic thriller. It looks more like an erotic horror with the horror removed. Berkley’s baffling performance, abruptly switching back and forth between sultry pouting and pop-eyed badass defiance, is that of a Stepford sexbot; though it has to be said it is managed, like the rest of the film, with a fanatically focused consistency and Berkley’s onscreen appearance is impressive, even awe-inspiring in her trance-like beauty.Everything is deeply strange: the angular, jolting choreography, the persistent, repeated and pedantic revelation of naked breasts, and the grotesque treatment of ageing stripper Mama Bazoom, played by Lin Tucci, who is portrayed with absolute misogyny, though arguably no more so than anyone or anything else. Then there is the rape scene, which is not really redeemed by the rape-revenge scene.There is one tiny touch which gives Showgirls a kind of human dimension: poor out-of-towner Nomi buys herself a fancy gown and mispronounces the word “Versace” as “Ver-sayss” and is mocked by the sneery Vegas insiders (although Zack rather gallantly glosses over it). That whole moment seems to come from another film entirely. Are we rushing to clothe the naked emperor by contriving emollient or contrarian explanations for all this? Perhaps. (The hip young cinephiles inMia Hansen-Løve’s 2014 film Edenare shown debating whether the awfulness of Showgirls is deliberate.) It remains weirdly innocent in its absurdity.Showgirls is in UK and Irish cinemas from 6 June, and is streaming in Australia on SBS On Demand.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsLas VegasKyle MacLachlanreviewsShareReuse this content"

In terms of the ensuing loss, the independentForde report(2020), commissioned by Labour, provided compelling evidence that the deep factionalism in the party between pro- and anti-Corbynites during the election campaign became a major hindrance to making a Labour-led government feasible.Surely all members of the party who were involved in the factionalism during the campaign need to take responsibility for allowing theConservativesto form a minority government to impose their baleful policies on the country.John MaherLiverpoolShaun Soper sharply reminds John McDonnell that he and Corbyn lost two elections.

The more that Blue Labour promotes Reform-friendly policies, the less likely the others will remain supporters.In 2024 Keir Starmer achieved a very narrow coalition that won well in enough constituencies with fewer votes thanLabourachieved in 2019 (then described as the party’s worst result since 1935).There are some exceptional Labour MPs, like Simon Opher, who understand the importance of solidifying the centre-left coalition and fightingReform UKby retaining its values. But many are surrendering them by adopting the extremism of Reform.Starmer’s weak coalition of 2024 has fractured beyond measure, and for those on the left, the choices in England are a shift towards either the Greens and Liberal Democrats, or a new party of the left. The latter could be a real danger to Labour, as it could be as successful as the Social Democratic party was in the 1980s in dividing Labour and securing victory for a rightwing party.For many, particularly those in non-Labour seats, there is no point in waiting. Now is the time to find a new political home. The choice is not easy and will often depend on the local strength of the other centre-left parties.Chas TownleyBrockworth, GloucestershireAbout half a century ago, I wrote a report for the National Union of Journalists called Black and White:RaceReporting in Britain, pointing out that expressions like “a coloured man” were common in BBC news bulletins and in broadsheets. It asked why most media outlets employed no non‑white journalists.I now realise that, according to one of today’s Nigel Farage cults that is apparently supported by Blue Labour, I believed in diversity, equity and inclusion – three words not only to be expunged from Labour’s lexicon but made into a law of political purity. It seems I was guilty of the crime of “woke”.

If so, it’s no bad thing, 31 May).But while acknowledging that coercive measures to reduce population are a thing of the past, he does not mention that, even historically, the majority of these measures were voluntary and based on educating, empowering and providing contraceptive access to women and girls. This works because women choose lower fertility as soon as they are able to. Yet Kennedy ignores the millennia-old history of empires, churches and the military pushing for them to have more children.He is correct that we should not fear the prospect of immigrants populating rich countries, but wrong that we need them to perform low-wage labour to save us from dire consequences. Alarmist fears of low birthrates are most often spread by the Elon Musks of the world, who have obvious reasons for cheering the cheap labour that comes with population growth. That they are being increasingly parroted by “liberal” outlets shows that we have lost sight of the lowest- hanging fruit towards taking care of our citizens – taxes that make the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share rather than pressures that push women to have babies they don’t want.In a time of deepening climate change, species extinctions and pollution, and of soaring global inequality where people in high-fertility countries want, and deserve, materially secure lives, we should not be cheering the prospect of billions more humans to add to our already dire ecological and social predicaments.Kirsten StadePopulation BalanceAn entire article about overpopulation and no mention of myriad other species that are being wiped out to accommodate us. I’m not sure that any other animals will be left alive when the population peaks “at about 10.3 billion in the mid-2080s”, or if the planet will still be inhabitable.Ron BinghamMuswell Hill, LondonJonathan Kennedy builds on Isaac Asimov’s “bathroom metaphor” to demonstrate the dangers of populist leaders’ hostility to immigration. Figuratively speaking, he says they want to keep one bathroom for themselves and force everyone else to share the other one, but that this comes with risks: “Perhaps the other toilet becomes blocked and the whole flat is inundated with raw sewage.” Right. But this is also what inevitably happens when a limited number of bathrooms are shared with an ever-increasing number of people, even if they are shared equally.We must absolutely become better at sharing resources, but this won’t enable infinite growth on a finite planet. There is nothing “alarmist” about acknowledging that the Earth has limits. In fact, at our current population size, we’ve already breachedclose to seven out of ninecritical planetary boundaries.It’s good to see Kennedy acknowledge that today’s population movement focuses on women’s empowerment: “Educating women and giving them control over their lives has proved remarkably effective at reducing fertility rates.” Precisely, not to mention that empowering women is morally essential in its own right. So if we can improve lives and at the same time ensure that there are enough “bathrooms” for everyone to be comfortable and to avoid disasters, why wouldn’t we?Small changes in fertility rates have major impacts on future population sizes. While we are on track for a peak of over 10 billion, the UN’s projectionsalso showthat if every other woman had one more child than currently expected, our global population would soar to 14.4 billion by 2100, while if every other woman had one fewer child than expected, our global population would decline to 7 billion by 2100. One of these is a lot more compatible with a happy, healthy planet than the other.Olivia NaterPopulation ConnectionJonathan Kennedy acknowledges that current concerns about overpopulation relate to “climate change, resource depletion and biodiversity loss”, but then bewilderingly fails to address any of these issues. An implied cornucopian perspective is taken – these issues do not need to be addressed as either humankind’s ingenuity will sort them out or humankind at least will not suffer too much from their effects (with no regard paid to the non-human species that we inhabit the planet with). With humankind currentlytransgressing at least six of nine planetary boundaries, the cornucopian perspective is a dangerous one and needs to be challenged wherever encountered. Overpopulation needs to be acknowledged as a major challenge to bringing human impacts on our world back within sustainable boundaries.Shane DelphineMelbourne, AustraliaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

He and his wife, a successful businesswoman, had applied to come to the UK with their 18-month-old child for three weeks in the summer so they could spend time with his sister, Hope Ibeawuchi-Beales, and her husband, Nick Beales, who is head of campaigning at Ramfel, which supports vulnerable migrants.Despite Ibeawuchi-Beales and Beales undertaking to support the family during their trip, a Home Office official turned down the visit visa application. The refusal letter states: “This sponsorship does not satisfy me of your own intention to leave the UK on completion of your visit.”It adds that future visits are also likely to be refused. Officials also queried how Ibeawuchi, who provided the Home Office with his business registration certificate, derives an income from his business as a self-employed person.BKay Security has provided services to the former Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan, senior UK and US politicians, celebrities and international footballers including Alex Iwobi, the former Arsenal and Everton player who currently plays for Fulham andNigeria.It wasreportedlast month that the government was planning to clamp down on visa applications for people from several countries, including Nigeria. Beales said: “There’s no doubt that the UK government refused these visa applications as part of their overtly racist crackdown on Nigerians.“Samuel and his wife both run successful businesses in Nigeria and have no interest in remaining here after visiting my family, and had we applied for their visas a year ago I have no doubt they’d have been granted. It sadly says a lot though when the Labour party is even more hostile to families such as ours than their Conservative predecessors.”Ibeawuchi said he was very disappointed that the Home Office was barring him and his family from coming to the UK. “I feel very bad that the Home Office refused us. I really wanted to take my family to the UK for a visit and we submitted all the necessary documents and photos of the two families spending time together.“We do not want to stay in the UK, just to come here to visit our family for three weeks.”Ibeawuchi-Beales said: “Our two kids were so excited for their little cousin, aunty and uncle to visit and had already planned all the things they wanted to show them in London.

Many career judges chose not to run.Roughly 2,600 posts, from local magistrates to supreme court justices, were up for grabs. Given the sheer number of positions and candidates involved, critics had warned that a low turnout was likely. Parts of the opposition also called for a boycott.In the event, just 13% of Mexicans voted, a record low in a federal election.Mexican president hails ‘complete success’ after just 13% vote in judicial electionsRead more“The turnout was frankly meagre,” said Javier Martín Reyes, a constitutional law professor at Mexico’s Unam university. “The government has tried to argue that voters were demanding this reform. But this has been proven false.”Sheinbaum described the process as “a complete success”, adding: “Mexico is the most democratic country in the world.”There was evidence of illegal party interference in the elections through the distribution ofcheat sheetstelling people how to vote, largely with the names of the government’s favoured candidates.All nine of the new justices on the supreme court were included onsuch cheat sheets. Most have ties to the governing party, meaning it may no longer act as a check on Morena’s executive power, as it has in the past.Aguilar is among them, having served as a senior official at the National Institute for Indigenous Peoples during the government of Sheinbaum’s predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.One of Aguilar’s campaign promises was to promote justice for Indigenous communities and the environment – yet under López Obrador he coordinated consultations for mega-projects such as the Maya Train and the Interoceanic Corridor, a train-and-port system to connect trade between the Pacific and the Atlantic, that wereriddled with irregularities.Two other candidates with previous ties to Morena are María Ríos, who served as legal counsel to López Obrador when he was president, and Irving Espinosa, who was an adviser to Morena lawmakers.Three sitting justices who decided to run were all re-elected: Lenia Batres, Yasmín Esquivel and Loretta Ortiz. All three were initially nominated by López Obrador and have largely voted in favour of Morena governments.It is not certain how justices with past ties to Morena will vote, but if they band together they could give Sheinbaum a decisive majority on Mexico’s highest court.Even those with more independent profiles might fear to go against the executive, said Martín Reyes.“Morena and its allies have a supermajority – they can change the constitution at any moment, start political trials, remove [the justices’] immunity,” said Martín Reyes. “These people will live under the threat of sanction.”The National Electoral Institute will continue to release results over the next week, including for the powerful new disciplinary tribune, tasked with supervising judges, and the top electoral court.Preliminary resultssuggest Morena may have significant influence in the first of those, too.“These elections were a failure and a success,” said Martín Reyes. “A failure in terms of democratic participation – but a success in terms of political capture.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoIndigenous peoplesClaudia SheinbaumAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He’s now 36 years into exile | Nuria KhasimRead more“The CCP [Chinese Communist party] actively tries to censor the facts, but the world will never forget.”Responding to Rubio’s remarks on Wednesday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said: “Erroneous statements by the US side maliciously distort historical facts, deliberately attack China’s political system and developmental path, and seriously interfere in China’s internal affairs.”Separately,Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory, also praised the bravery of the Tiananmen Square protesters.“Authoritarian governments often choose to silence and forget history, while democratic societies choose to preserve the truth and refuse to forget those who gave their lives – and their dreams – to the idea of human rights,” said Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te.Ahead of the 1989 massacre, protesters had been gathering for weeks in the square to call for democratic reforms to the CCP. The student-led movement attracted worldwide attention, which turned to horror as tanks rolled into the square to clear the encampment. Several protesters were also killed ata smaller demonstration in Chengdu, a city in south-west China.The date of 4 June remains one of China’s strictest taboos, and the Chinese government employs extensive and increasingly sophisticated resources to censor any discussion or acknowledgment of it inside China.Internet censors scrub even the most obscure references to the date from online spaces, and activists in China are often put under increased surveillance or sent on enforced “holidays” away from Beijing.New research from human rights workers has found that the sensitive date also sees heightened transnational repression of Chinese government critics overseas by the government and its proxies.The report published on Wednesday byArticle 19, a human rights research and advocacy group, said that the Chinese government “has engaged in a systematic international campaign of transnational repression targeting protesters critical of the Chinese Communist party”, with Uyghurs, Tibetans and Hongkongers particularly likely to be affected.View image in fullscreenThe Pillar of Shame, a statue made by Danish artist Jens Galschiøt to commemorate the victims of the 1989 Beijing Tiananmen Square massacre, displayed at the University of Hong Kong before it was removed in 2021.Photograph: Jérôme Favre/EPAThe report citedFreedom House researchin 2023, which found that China had been responsible for about 30% all recorded acts of physical transnational repression since 2014.“Protesters targeted by [transnational repression] frequently live in fear of surveillance; targeting; abduction and forced repatriation, especially around embassies and consulates; and ‘collective punishment’ retaliation against relatives still in China, which also leads people to cut ties with their family,” the report said.The Article 19 researchers found that, with Tiananmen Square vigils snuffed out in China, pro-CCP agents appear to be targeting commemorations in other parts of the world.In 2022, a replica of a statue known as the Pillar of Shame, by the Danish artist Jens Galschiøt, was vandalised in Taipei. The statue is designed to memorialise the people who died on 4 June 1989. The original was on display at the University of Hong Kong for 23 years before it was removed by university authorities in 2021.For many years, Hong Kong, and to a lesser extent Macau, were the only places on Chinese territory where the event could be commemorated.View image in fullscreenPolice officers stand guard during a stop and search near Victoria Park in Hong Kong ahead of the 36th anniversary of Tiananmen Square massacre.Photograph: Tyrone Siu/ReutersBut since the 2019 pro-democracy protests and the ensuing crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, the annual 4 June vigil in Victoria Parkhas been banned.In recent years some high-profile activists have been prosecuted over attempts to mark the day. For the last three years a government-sponsored food carnival has been held on the site during the week of the anniversary.On Tuesday there was a heavy police presence in Causeway Bay, near the park, Hong Kong Free Press reported.A performance artist, Chan Mei-tung, was stopped and searched, and later escorted from the area by police. She was standing on the road chewing gum, according to the outlet. In 2022 Chan was arrested after she stood in the same area peeling a potato.On Tuesday Hong Kong’s chief executive, John Lee, warned that any activity conducted on Wednesday must be “lawful”, but was not specific. A key criticism of Hong Kong’s national security laws are that they are broad and the proscribed crimes are ill-defined.One of the few groups of people in China who are still outspoken about the events of 36 years ago are the rapidly ageing “Tiananmen Mothers”, parents of young people killed in the massacre, who have called for an official reckoning.One of the founding members, 88-year-old Zhang Xianling, gave a rare interview this year with Radio Free Asia, saying that she still lives under close surveillance.Zhangsaid: “I don’t know why they are so afraid of me. I am 88 years old and I have to use a wheelchair if I can’t walk 200 metres. Am I that scary?”Earlier this week Li Xiaoming, an ex-PLA officer who has lived in Australia for 25 years, gave an interviewto Taiwan media, about his involvement at the Tiananmen crackdown as a junior soldier.Li said he was compelled to talk “as a warning to the world”, and also toTaiwan which is facing the threat of Chinese annexation.“Although the CCP leadership sees the 4 June incident as something shameful, what they learned from it is the need for strict control – eliminating any sign of unrest early on, controlling and blocking public opinion, and brainwashing to people. They work to crush all instability at the earliest stage,” he said according to Channel News Asia’s translation.Additional reporting by Oliver HolmesExplore more on these topicsChinaTaiwanAsia PacificMarco RubioTiananmen Square protests 1989newsShareReuse this content"

The two-child policy was not universally enforced, though members of the Communist party could face sanctions.Birthrates are plummeting worldwide. Can governments turn the tide?Read moreAuthorities are now searching for ways to boost families, as Vietnam’s birthrate fell to a record low of 1.91 children per woman in 2024, which is below replacement level.Officials fear the trend could lead to an ageing society, creating labour shortages, putting pressure on social welfare systems and threatening the country’s economic growth plans.Birthrates are especially low in urban centres, such as Ho Chi Minh City, where the rising cost of living was identified as barrier for young families. Its birthrate fell to 1.32 in 2023.Local provinces are offering various rewards and subsidies to encourage couples to have children. This includes certificates of merit and a financial reward of about 1m dong (£28) for women who have two children before the age of 35. Some provinces, such as Tien Giang in southern Vietnam, were also giving 30m dong to communes and wards in which 60% of couples of childbearing age had two children across three consecutive years, state media reported. Birthrates in the province are still falling, however.The national birthrate of 1.91 children per woman recorded in 2024 was down from 2.11 children per woman in 2021, 2.01 in 2022 and 1.96 in 2023. Neighbouring countries, such as Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia, have similar trends.In Japan, the government released figures on Wednesday showing the number of births in 2024 had fallen below 700,000 for the first time on record.Vietnam appeared to relax its two-child policy in 2003, but this wasreversed in 2008.Vietnam is also trying to tackle an imbalance in its sex ratio, driven by a historical preference for boys. On Tuesday the ministry of health proposed tripling a current fine to $3,800 “to curb foetal gender selection”, according to state media.The gender ratio at birth, though improved, remains skewed at 112 boys for every 100 girls.China ended its strict“one-child policy”in 2016 and in 2021 permitted couples to have three children, though its population fell for the third year running in 2024.AFP contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsVietnamPopulationAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The foundations of Washington’s ties with Seoul, one of its most important allies in the Asia-Pacific, appeared as firm as Yoon’s more-than-passable crooning.As he prepares to replace thenow-disgraced Yoon, South Korea’s new leader,Lee Jae-myung, will have to strike a very different note with Biden’s successor in the White House.His modest inauguration complete, Lee will focus initially on healing the open wound his predecessor inflicted on South Korean society and kick-starting growth in Asia’s fourth biggest economy.Inevitably, though, he will soon have to find a way to engage with Donald Trump’s White House, whose initial reaction to Lee’s resounding victory over his conservative opponent was to suggest that his bumpy path to power had been smoothed by Chinese interference in the vote.Not surprisingly, Lee devoted a good chunk of his first speech as president to Trump’s trade war, describing rising protectionism as “a threat to our very survival”.There are no immediate plans, though, to request talks over the imposition, from Wednesday, of50% tariffson imports of steel and aluminium.South Koreawas the fourth largest exporter of steel to the US last year, accounting for 13% of its total steel imports.“President Lee will find himself with little to no time to spare before tackling the most important task of his early presidency: reaching a deal with Trump,” the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said in an analysis.There was little detail, too, on how Lee intends to repair economic ties with China – by far South Korea’s biggest trading partner – without alienating Trump.Restoring public confidence in post-Yoon democracy aside, other huge challenges await Lee, according to Kim Jun-seok, a political science professor at Dongguk University in Seoul. “A grim outlook on the economy that’s projected to grow maybe less than 1%. And there’s a crisis outside, dealing with Trump. He has a lot of work to do.”The biggest foreign policy challenge facing incoming South Korean presidents has traditionally centred on nuclear-armedNorth Korea. On Wednesday, Lee vowed to restart dialogue with the North after three years of rapidly deteriorating ties under Yoon.“No matter how costly, peace is better than war,” he said, promising to “deter North Korean nuclear and military provocations while opening communication channels”.Even though Trump recently repeated a demand made during his first presidency that Seoul pay more towards the cost of hosting 28,500 US troops in South Korea, bilateral security ties appear to be on solid ground – for now.“The US and South Korea share an ironclad commitment to the alliance grounded in our mutual defence treaty, shared values, and deep economic ties,” the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said after Lee’s victory.How much room for manoeuvre Lee has in reaching out to both China and the US remains to be seen. So far, he has made a point of lauding the US-South Korea relationship and says he intends to bolster a trilateral partnership with Washington and Tokyo.After his brief inauguration at the national assembly, Lee made the customary telephone call to the head of his joint chiefs of staff, before honouring South Korean war dead at the national cemetery in Seoul. He was expected to take calls from world leaders later in the day, with Trump first to offer his congratulations.“Political leadership is crucial at times like this,” said Kim Dae-jong, a professor at Sejong University in Seoul. “And with an elected president, a phone call with Trump could improve the situation significantly.”Lee’s supporters describe him as a pragmatic and effective negotiator, but if he can bring himself to follow the lead of his predecessor, he could do worse than heed the message of another Don McLean hit from the early 1970s: If We Try.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaNorth KoreaLee Jae-myungUS foreign policyAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

And that’s what they did.”Kellogg also repeated rumours that Ukraine had struck the Russian nuclear fleet at Severomorsk, although reports of an explosion there have not been confirmed. He said the US was “trying to avoid” an escalation.Other current and former members of the administration skeptical of US support for Ukraine have also vocally opposed the drone strikes.“It is not in America’s interest for Ukraine to be attacking Russia’s strategic nuclear forces the day before another round of peace talks,” said Dan Caldwell, an influential foreign policy adviser who was a senior aide to Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon until he was purged amid a leaking scandal last month.“This has the potential to be highly escalatory and raises the risk of direct confrontation between Russia and Nato,” he said. “US should not only distance itself from this attack but end any support that could directly or indirectly enable attacks against Russian strategic nuclear forces.”It is not the first time that concerns over Russia’s use of a nuclear weapon have been used to try to temper US support for Ukraine.As Moscow’s forces were routed near Kharkiv and in the south at Kherson in September 2022, Russian officials sent signals that the Kremlin was considering using a battlefield nuclear weapon, senior Biden officials have said.National security officials said they believed that if the Russian lines collapsed and left open the potential for a Ukrainian attack on Crimea, then there was a 50% chance that Russia would use a nuclear weapon as a result.Ukrainian officials have responded by saying that Russia has embellished its threats of a nuclear attack in order to blackmail the US from giving greater support to Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaNuclear weaponsEuropeUS foreign policyDonald TrumpVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

The programme has expanded considerably since 2018, when Trump withdrew from a multilateral agreement to constrain it in exchange for sanctions relief.In separate remarks on Wednesday, Putin once again ruled out a comprehensive ceasefire in Ukraine, claiming it would just give Kyiv time to regroup and rearm, while Ukraine’sVolodymyr Zelenskyydescribed Moscow’s peace proposals presented earlier this week as nothing more than an “ultimatum”.Operation Spiderweb: a visual guide to Ukraine’s destruction of Russian aircraftRead moreThe comments from both leaders confirmednegotiations in Istanbul on Mondayhad made no headway towards a truce, but the two sides signalled progress on other issues, including the transfer of captives and bodies.Russia said it was “working” on the return of more than 300 Ukrainian children who the Kyiv government and the international criminal court (ICC) say were abducted by invading forces.It also confirmed there would be a prisoner exchange in the coming days, and there were continuing discussions on plans to repatriate thousands of bodies of fallen soldiers from both sides.Zelenskyy said he expected 500 PoWs to be swapped this weekend, but he said that the broader peace proposal put forward by Russia in Istanbul amounted to “an ultimatum from the Russian side to us”.Immediately after Monday’s meeting, Ukrainian officials said they needed more time to study the document handed over by the Russians, but press reports at the time said that it simply restated Russia’s maximalist demand that Ukrainian forces withdraw from four regions under partial Russian occupation.Putin stated his position on Wednesday in the form of a televised virtual meeting with his aides.After being informed that Ukraine had proposed an unconditional ceasefire of 30 to 60 days, Putin asked: “Why reward them by giving them a break from the combat, which will be used to pump the regime with western arms, to continue their forced mobilisation and to prepare different terrorist acts?”4:42Ukraine releases dramatic FPV footage of drone attack on Russian airbases – videoHe pointed to recent Ukrainian attacks on bridges inside Russia,one of which helped cause a train crash that killed seven people.On Sunday, Ukraine also carried out aremote-controlled mass drone attackon four Russian airfields, which Kyiv claims knocked out more than a third of Moscow’s heavy bombers capable of firing cruise missiles.Ukrainian officials said 41 Russian warplanes, including strategic bombers and other types of combat aircraft, were destroyed or damaged in Sunday’s operation, which they claimed had taken 18 months to plan. On Wednesday, they released additional drone footage of the attack, codenamed Operation Spiderweb.Satellite photos analysed and published by the Associated Press showed aircraft wreckage and scorched areas at Belaya base, one of the four airfields targeted.It said the images showed at least three Tu-95 and four Tu-22M bombers – both capable of firing cruise missiles – had been destroyed on the runway. Other aircraft at the base appeared unscathed.In his Truth Social post, Trump said the drone attacks on Russian airfields had come up in his hour-and-15-minute conversation with Putin on Wednesday.“We discussed the attack on Russia’s docked airplanes, by Ukraine, and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides,” Trump said.“It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace. President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields.”Trump told Putin that Ukraine did not inform him before the drone attacks, a Kremlin spokesperson said.Putin also spoke on Wednesday to Pope Leo XIV, in the US-born pontiff’s first call to the Russian leader since he became head of the world’s Catholics last month.The Vatican said in a statement that during the call, “the pope made an appeal for Russia to make a gesture that favours peace”.Before the Istanbul talks, Russia stepped up its aerial attacks on cities, and pushed further into Ukraine’s northern region of Sumy, seizing more than 150 sq km (58 sq miles) of the area in less than two weeks, according to Russian claims and Ukrainian open-source mapping.During his election campaign, Trump claimed more than 50 times he could end the Ukraine conflict within a day, but his comments on Wednesday did not involve any calls for restraint.View image in fullscreenA satellite image shows a Tupolev Tu-22 aircraft destroyed following a series of Ukrainian drone strikes at the Belaya airbase in Russia.Photograph: Maxar Technologies Handout/EPAWhile Putin has ruled out a comprehensive ceasefire, Russia has suggested two- to three-day local truces on different parts of the frontline, to allow the opposing armies to collect their dead, a proposal Moscow says Kyiv has rejected.However, both sides showed on Wednesday they were ready to continue with the exchange of PoWs, the bodies of dead soldiers, and to offer some cooperation on Kyiv’s priority, the return of Ukrainian children.In the televised government meeting on Wednesday, the chief Russian negotiator in Istanbul, Vladimir Medinsky, said Russia was “working” on the return of Ukrainian children, noting that Kyiv had presented a list of 339 of them.Russia has claimed Ukrainian children were taken to Russia for their safety, while Kyiv insisted they had been abducted. The Ukrainian view was underpinned by the ICC, whichissued arrest warrantsin March 2023 for Putin and his “commissioner for children’s rights”, Maria Lvova-Belova, for their role in the “unlawful deportation” of the Ukrainian children.After the Istanbul meeting, Zelenskyy said the Ukrainian delegation had handed the Russians a list of nearly 400 names of abducted Ukrainian children, but claimed that Russia had only offered to resolve the cases of 10 of them.After Monday’s talks, Turkey’s leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, announced he wanted to host a Putin-Zelenskyy summit also involving Trump. Zelenskyy has been challenging his Russian counterpart to meet him face to face for some months.“We are ready for such a meeting any day,” the Ukrainian leader said on Wednesday, adding it was “pointless” to hold further talks with the midlevel Russian delegates Putin has sent to the talks – who Zelenskyy has previously dismissed as “empty heads” – since they were not empowered to agree a ceasefire.Putin maintained his opposition to a personal meeting with Zelenskyy, however, on the grounds of the recent attacks on railways in the Kursk and Bryansk border regions, which he described as “terrorist acts”.“How can any such [summit] meetings be conducted in such circumstances? What shall we talk about?” Putin asked in his video call with his officials.Since Trump’s return to the White House in January, European capitals have sought to take more of a leading role in bolstering Ukraine’s defence, and on Wednesday, a series of military industrial support measures were announced at a meeting of the 52-country strong Ukraine Defense Contact Group at Nato headquarters in Brussels, chaired jointly by the UK and Germany.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpVladimir PutinRussiaUkraineUS foreign policyVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Despite critics likening the legislation to Russia’s “foreign agent” law, it was forecast to be passed by parliament as Fidesz holds a two-thirds majority.But on Wednesday, Fidesz’ parliamentary party leader, Mâté Kocsis, told local media that the vote would be postponed until autumn as the government had received several suggestions regarding the law. “We are united in our intentions, but there is still debate about the means,” he added on social media.Civil rights organisations celebrated the delay, with Amnesty International calling it a “huge joint success”.“Of course, we can only rest easy once this unlawful bill has been scrapped for good,” the group said on social media. “Unfortunately, one thing is certain: the government will not give up its attempts to silence independent voices, as has been its goal since 2010.”Previously, Zoltán Kovács, a spokesperson for the Hungarian government,had saidthe bill had been introduced amid worries that foreign-funded organisations, primarily from the US and Brussels, were shaping the country’s political discourse.The legislation takes a broad view of what constitutes a threat, describing it as acts undermining Hungary’s constitutional identity or Christian culture or challenging the primacy of marriage, the family and biological sexes.The proposal was swiftly slammed by opposition politicians, who said it would allow the government to potentially shut down all independent media and NGOs engaged in public affairs, while Transparency International described it as a “dark turning point” for Hungary. “It is designed to crush dissent, silence civil society, and dismantle the pillars of democracy,” the organisation noted.The warning was echoed by the Hungarian Helsinki Committee. “If this bill passes, it will not simply marginalise Hungary’s independent voices – it will extinguish them,” co-chair Márta Pardavisaid in a statementthat described the draft law as “Operation Starve and Strangle”.Scores of Hungarians took to the streets in protest while more than 90 editors-in-chief and publishers from across Europe, including from the Guardian, Libération in France and Gazeta Wyborcza in Poland,called on the EUto take action.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many in the country’s steadily shrinking civic space had been left rattled by the proposed law and reeling from the uncertainty of what comes next.“And we’ve already felt the chilling effects, especially smaller, weaker organisations who were really frightened by the draft law and the potential consequences,” she said. “So even if it’s not passed – which would be great – it’s already had an impact.”Explore more on these topicsHungaryViktor OrbánEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It took the total number of such arrivals so far this year to 14,812, the highest on record.It was reported that French officials stopped fewer than 200 people from making the journey, but Home Office sources said French authorities had intervened to stop nearly 500 people trying to get into small boats on that day. There was footage of a gendarmes looking on from the beach as people attempting to reach the UK ran into the water and climbed onboard small boats.Current guidelines prevent French police from intervening offshore unless it is to rescue passengers in distress. In practice, the policy means officers can stop boats leaving the beach by puncturing them, but are restricted once they are in the water.In February, Bruno Retailleau, the French interior minister, said he wanted a change to the rules to enable officers to intervene in the water up to 300 metres from the coast. “We have to review our organisation so that we can board these boats … arriving to pick up migrants,” he said.Le Figaro newspaper reported earlier this year that ministry officials were still working on what were being termed the “feet in the water” guidelines to implement the policy. However, the French maritime daily newspaper Le Marin said the proposed change of rules had been opposed by local police officers.Cooper has said she wants French border police to intercept the taxi boats not only in the shallow waters as they leave the beaches but also when they make their way from rivers and inland waterways to pick up people on the beach. With heatwaves forecast this summer, there are concerns still larger numbers of people will attempt the perilous crossing.Traffickers have circumvented rules by asking asylum seekers to wade waist-high into the Channel, where they are picked up by dinghies that were launched from inland canals.French government sourcestold the Telegraphon Wednesday that ministers overseeing migration policy had given the green light to stopping boats in the water while respecting the law of the sea.It is understood that the French authorities have said they will draw up plans to intercept boats in shallow waters within weeks.Cooper is also planning a new law to fast-track the removal of asylum seekers who arrivefrom countries deemed to be safe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionA Home Office analysis released on Wednesday morning claimed that the record numbers of people arriving in the UK via small boats could be attributed to favourable weather and greater numbers being crammed into vessels. Figures show there were twice as many “red days” – when there are calmer conditions in the Channel, meaning crossings are more likely – in the first four months of this year as there were in the same period in 2024.In the year to April, 47% of boats crossing the Channel had 60 or more people onboard, compared with 2% in the year to April 2022.The Migration Observatory at Oxford University challenged the Home Office analysis, saying there was no evidence that weather was a major factor in long-term increases in arrivals.Priti Patel, then Tory home secretary, attempted to draw up plans for UK and French officers to intervene at sea in 2021, but her French counterpart said thatFrancewould not accept any practices contrary to the law of the sea. The plans were eventually shelved.Responding to the latest plans, Steve Smith, the chief executive of Care4Calais, said the plan would cost more lives at sea as gangs and asylum seekers took greater risks to reach the UK.“Last year saw a record number of refugees lose their lives on our border, and still our political leaders risk more deaths rather than create safe routes to claim asylum,” he said.“Interceptions in the sea, like the last Tory government’s failed attempt to implement pushbacks, have never been tried because they put lives at risk, and are most likely illegal. Like all the other so-called deterrents, and failed security initiatives, this is doomed to fail, but it will cost lives along the way.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Washington vetoed a similar resolution in November, under the Biden administration, on the grounds that the ceasefire demand wasnot directly linked to the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas.The text was co-sponsored by Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Pakistan, Panama, South Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, and Somalia. Russia, China, France and the UK also voted in favour.“The Council was prevented from shouldering its responsibility, despite the fact that most of us seem to be converging on one view,” said France’s ambassador to the UN Jerome Bonnafont.“Today, the United States sent a strong message by vetoing a counterproductive UN Security Council resolution on Gaza targetingIsrael,” US secretary of state Marco Rubio said in a statement after the vote.He said Washington would not support any text that “draws a false equivalence between Israel and Hamas, or disregards Israel’s right to defend itself.“The United States will continue to stand with Israel at the UN.”Israel also welcomed the US veto.“I thank @POTUS and the U.S. administration for standing shoulder to shoulder with Israel and vetoing this one-sided resolution in the UN Security Council,” wrote Gideon Saar, Israel’s minister of foreign affairs. “The proposed resolution only strengthens Hamas and undermines American efforts to achieve a hostage deal.”The UK supported the resolution. In a statement, its ambassador, Barbara Woodward, called Israel’s new aid system “inhumane” and said that Israel “needs to end its restrictions on aid now”.“This Israeli government’s decisions to expand its military operations in Gaza and severely restrict aid are unjustifiable, disproportionate and counterproductive,” she said. “And the UK completely opposes them.”Other security council members criticised the US for the veto. Pakistan’s ambassador to the UN said the failed resolution would “remain not only a moral stain on the conscience of this council, but a fateful moment of political application that will reverberate for generations.”China’s ambassador to the UN Fu Cong said: “today’s vote result once again exposes that the root cause of the council’s inability to quell the conflict in Gaza is the repeated obstruction by the US.”The resolution was put up for a vote as the UN and aid agencies have warned of famine conditions in Gaza after a protracted embargo on aid and the shambolic rollout of a US- and Israeli-backed scheme called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).What we know about the killing of Palestinians at a food point in GazaRead more“The world is watching, day after day, horrifying scenes of Palestinians being shot, wounded or killed in Gaza while simply trying to eat,” said the UN relief chief, Tom Fletcher, on Wednesday.GHF, which has murky political backing and funding, announced that itsdistribution centres in Gaza would remain closed for a second day on Thursday morning. At least 27 people were killed and hundreds injured on Tuesday by Israeli fire as they waited for food at a GHF distribution point.Woodward, the UK permanent representative to the UN, voiced support for a UN call for “an immediate and independent investigation into these events and for perpetrators to be held accountable”.“Israel needs to end its restrictions on aid now: let the UN and humanitarians do their job to save lives, reduce suffering and maintain dignity,” she said.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warUnited NationsGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelForeign policyUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

We strongly urge all those heading to our locations to follow the routes set by the IDF to ensure safe passage,” it said. It did not give any further details.Gaza Humanitarian Foundation names US evangelical leader as new chairRead moreThe GHF had previously said it had asked the Israeli military to “guide foot traffic in a way that minimises confusion or escalation risks” near military perimeters, develop clearer guidance for civilians and enhance training to support civilian safety. “Our top priority remains ensuring the safety and dignity of civilians receiving aid,” said a GHF spokesperson.An Israeli military spokesperson warned civilians against moving in areas leading to GHF sites on Wednesday, deeming them “combat zones”.The previous day, GHF announced that its distribution points would be closed on Wednesday for “update, organisation and efficiency improvement work”.The killing of the 27 or more Palestinians was the third such shooting in three days, and Israel admitted on Tuesday for the first time that its forces shot at Palestinians. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops fired shots near a food distribution complex after noticing “a number of suspects moving towards them”.“The forces fired evasive shots, and after they did not move away, additional shots were fired near the individual suspects who were advancing towards the forces. The individuals were moving towards forces in a way that posed a threat to them,” the military said, without specifying who the suspects were.MapA spokesperson for the GHF, which has taken over the distribution of food in Gaza and is backed by Israel, told the Associated Press that the group “was saddened to learn that a number of civilians were injured and killed after moving beyond the designated safe corridor”.The shooting occurred at the same site where on Sunday more than30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli firewhile they were heading to the distribution hub.The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, said the “deadly attacks” on civilians around food distribution points was a war crime.“Deadly attacks on distraught civilians trying to access the paltry amounts of food aid in Gaza are unconscionable,” Türk said. “Attacks directed against civilians constitute a grave breach of international law and a war crime.”Witnesses told the Guardian that the shooting started in the city’s Flag Roundabout area, about a kilometre from the food distribution hub.Fadi Abu Mohammad, 43, said his relative Mohammad Abu Shamala, 22, was killed near the food distribution site. “When gunfire opened on the civilians, he was struck by a bullet in the back and died instantly,” Fadi said.2:27What we know about the Gaza food centres – video“He was supposed to get married next month. Going back to the aid distribution is a huge risk and a potential death sentence, but everyone who went had no other choice. If they aren’t killed by bullets or shelling, they will die of hunger.”Israelimposed a blockade on all suppliesin March, claiming Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters. The group denies this and aid officials in Gaza havedenied there is evidenceof any widespread diversion of supplies at any stage of the conflict. In May a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the Strip faced starvation.The GHF took over the handling of food relief despite objections from the UN and other humanitarian organisations, which criticised the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, and that it allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population.On Tuesday, an evangelical leader and adviser to Donald Trump on interfaith issues was appointed as thenew head of the GHF. Johnnie Moore, a member of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom and founder of the boutique advisory firm Kairos Company, replaced Jake Wood, a former marine, who resigned saying hecould not guarantee the GHF’s independencefrom Israeli interests.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over160 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Moore has been a vocal defender of the GHF and has bristled at public criticism of the rollout, telling the UN secretary general, António Guterres, on X that reports of Palestinians killed and injured while seeking food supplies in Gaza were “a lie … spread by terrorists”.The UN security council is expected to vote on Wednesday on a demand for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and humanitarian access across Gaza, where malnutrition is widespread and food relief has only trickled in since Israel lifted an 11-week blockade in late May.“It is unacceptable. Civilians are risking – and in several instances losing – their lives just trying to get food,” a UN spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said on Tuesday, adding that the food distribution model backed by the US and Israel was “a recipe for disaster, which is exactly what is going on”.At least 48 people were killed by Israeli bombardment across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, including 14 in a single strike on a tent sheltering displaced people, the civil defence agency said.Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

It said there was a “massive disconnect” between public despair at events in Gaza and what it called the “complacency” of political leaders.Oxfam UK’s chief executive, Halima Begum, said: “It is beyond comprehension that aid distribution points should be turned into killing fields.”The Foreign Office minister Hamish Falconer said later on Wednesday that if Israel did not cease “the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in this place”. He added: “I will not say from the dispatch box today when that might be.”Falconer was confronted on Wednesday by angry MPs from multiple parties demanding stronger British action on sanctions, weapons sales and Palestinian recognition. Dozens ofLabourand Tory MPs have recently signed letters to the prime minister calling for Palestine to be recognised immediately but have so far not received a response.Paula Barker, a Labour backbencher, asked: “What more evidence do we need to call this exactly what it is – a deliberate policy of annexation and genocide?”Kit Malthouse, a Conservative MP, said: “We’re all, frankly, getting a bit fed up with the theatrics in this chamber. And, if I’m honest with the minister, it feels like the whole house is being played. He shows up, he mouths the words full of condemnation and being appalled, and very occasionally, the government leaks out just enough sanctions, frankly, I’m afraid, to keep the Labour benches from open revolt.”Malthouse’s Tory colleague Jeremy Wright added: “I now believe it’s necessary for the UK, hopefully, in conjunction with others, to recognise the state of Palestine. Why has it not yet?”The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn successfully passed a bill calling for an independent inquiry into British involvement in Israeli military action in Gaza. The inquiry is unlikely ever to happen, however, because the government will not support a substantive vote that would enable one to be set up.While MPs were debating in the Commons chamber, dozens of protesters gathered outside, one of whom was arrested after an altercation with a police officer at the gates of parliament.Falconer confirmed to MPs that the government was reconsidering its position on Palestinian statehood, and that ministers were open to the idea of immediate recognition.Government sources said one option wa to make an announcement at or after a UN conference later this month being hosted by France and Saudi Arabia to talk about a two-state solution. The government is keen to secure compromises in exchange, including an agreement by Hamas to leave Gaza entirely.On arms sales, ministers have already cancelled licences for many of the weapons Britain used to sell to Israel, saying it would only export “defensive” arms in the future. The Guardian revealed last month that British companies had managed to export thousands of military items to Israel, including munitions.Meanwhile, ministers are fighting a legal case to be allowed to continue making spare parts for American-made F-35s, which are used by Israel but also by many Nato allies. They argue that stopping such sales could harm other non-Israeli partners.The ICRC, which is in effect the guardian of the Geneva conventions governing the conduct of war, is carefully diplomatic in its dealings with warring parties and normally does not speak publicly about convention violations.However, Spoljaric told the BBC in an interview that Israel’s current actions in Gaza amounted to a “hollowing out” of international law and not enough was being done by to end the war, stop Palestinian suffering and release Israeli hostages.She highlighted the level of destruction and suffering in Gaza, and said the world was “watching a people being entirely stripped of its dignity” and this “should really shock our collective conscience”.She added: “State leaders are under an obligation to act. I’m calling on them to do something, and to do more, and do what they can, Because it will reverberate, it will haunt them, it will reach their doorsteps.”On Tuesdaythe ICRC reportedthat its Rafah field hospital in southern Gaza, which is close to a food distribution site, had received 184 patients in what it called a “mass casualty influx.” It said 19 patients were dead on arrival, the majority with gunshot wounds. Eight more died from their wounds.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelLabourMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The manuscripts range from legal documents to parts of the Hebrew Bible, and are thought to date from around the third century BCE to the second century CE.Now researchers have used artificial intelligence to glean fresh insights into the dates of individual scrolls – findings experts suggest could challenge ideas about when, where and by whom they were produced.“It’s like a time machine. So we can shake hands with these people from 2,000 years ago, and we can put them in time much better now, said Prof Mladen Popović, first author of the research from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.While some scrolls were radiocarbon dated in the 1990s, Popović said scholars did not tackle the problem of castor oil contamination – a substance applied in the 1950s to help experts read the manuscripts, but which could skew results.In addition, many of the scrolls had only been dated by handwriting analysis.Writing in the journal Plos One, the team report how they attempted radiocarbon dating of 30 samples from different manuscripts found at four sites and thought to span five centuries. Crucially, the team first cleaned the samples to remove the castor oil contamination.The researchers successfully radiocarbon-dated 27 samples, finding that while two were younger than handwriting analysis had suggested, many were older.Among other findings, the researchers discovered two different writing styles, known as Hasmonean and Herodian scripts, coexisted for a much longer period than previously thought, while a sample from a manuscript called 4Q114 – which contains verses from the book of Daniel – was older than traditional palaeography had suggested.“It was previously dated to the late second century BCE, a generation after the author of the Book of Daniel. Now, with our study we move back in time contemporary to that author,” said Popović.The team then used a type of AI known as machine learning to build a model they called Enoch – a nod to a biblical figure associated with scientific knowledge.The team trained Enoch by feeding it 62 digital images of ink traces from 24 of the radiocarbon dated manuscripts, together with the carbon-14 dates.They then verified the model by showing Enoch a further 13 images from the same manuscripts. In 85% of cases the model produced ages that tallied with the radiocarbon dates, and in many cases produced a smaller range of probable dates than obtained from radiocarbon dating alone.“What we have created is a very robust tool that is empirically based – based on physics and on geometry,” said Popović.When Enoch was presented with images from 135 undated manuscripts it had not previously seen, it realistically dated 79% of them – as judged by expert palaeographers. Popović added those deemed unrealistic might have had problematic data, such as poor quality images.The system has already produced new insights including that a copy of the biblical book Ecclesiastes dates from the time of the book’s presumed author.Popović said Enoch meant the age of further scrolls could now be uncovered without radiocarbon dating – a process that requires the destruction of small samples.“There are more than 1,000 Dead Sea scrolls manuscripts so our study is a first but significant step, opening a door unto history with new possibilities for research,” he said.Prof emerita Joan Taylor of King’s College London, said the results would have a major impact on Qumran studies.“These results mean that most of the manuscripts found in the caves near Qumran would not have been written at the site of Qumran, which was not occupied until later,” she said.However, Dr Matthew Collins of the University of Chester cautioned that radiocarbon dating only shed light on the age of the parchment, not when it was written on, while there were also questions about how stylistically representative the small number of training samples were for different periods in time.“Overall, this is an important and welcome study, and one which may provide us with a significant new tool in our armoury for dating these texts,” he said. “Nevertheless, it’s one that we should adopt with caution, and in careful conjunction with other evidence.”Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyReligionMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Radiologists and clinical oncologists face “unsustainable” workloads, it adds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These delays may lead to the cancer spreading, making it harder to treat successfully.”The Department ofHealthand Social Care acknowledged that too many patients face delays.“This government inherited a broken NHS where too many cancer patients are waiting too long for treatment but through our plan for change, we are determined to tackle delays, diagnose cancer earlier and treat it faster,” a spokesperson said.“We are delivering 40,000 more appointments every week, investing £1.5bn in both new surgical hubs and AI scanners, rolling out cutting-edge radiotherapy machines to every region in the country, and backing our radiologists and oncologists with above inflation pay rises for the second year in a row.“Later this year we will also publish a refreshed workforce plan to ensure the NHS has the right people in the right places to deliver the care patients need.”Explore more on these topicsCancerNHSHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Women were also 39% less likely to have a procedure to replace their aortic valve.Aortic stenosis is a condition where the aortic valve, which controls blood moving from the heart to the body, starts restricting blood flow. This causes it to become narrow, resulting in symptoms such as shortness of breath and chest pain.The study also found that black patients were 48% less likely to undergo a procedure to replace their aortic valve than white patients, with south Asian patients being 27% less likely. Both groups were more likely to be referred to secondary care, although the researchers say that this could reflect referrals for other heart issues not related to their aortic stenosis.Dr Anvesha Singh, an associate professor at the University of Leicester and a consultant cardiologist, who was involved in the research, said: “Previous studies have shown lower rates of valve replacement in women, and clinicians had assumed that women were less likely to be diagnosed with aortic stenosis. This analysis using large, real-world data clearly shows that this is not the case, giving us the clearest picture yet of what is happening in day-to-day clinical practice.“Our study highlights potential inequities in management and care of this common and serious condition. More research is needed to understand the reasons for this and the true prevalence of aortic stenosis in different groups.”Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, the clinical director at the British Heart Foundation – which supported the research – and a consultant cardiologist, said: “This study of over 150,000 GP records has unveiled disparities in access to aortic valve treatment for women, south Asian and black people, and people living in more deprived communities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Criminal cases can be stopped at any point if a prosecutor decides there is no longer a realistic prospect of conviction, but this reform strengthens the right of victims to challenge the decision.Though a right to review already exists, it cannot be exercised when the case has been stopped in court. Under the terms of the pilot, for the first time victims of rape or serious sexual abuse will be offered the right to request a review by a different prosecutor before their case is dropped. If that prosecutor determines there is enough evidence, the case will continue.If the trial is successful in the West Midlands, ministers could extend it acrossEnglandand Wales.Jade Blue McCrossen-Nethercott, a justice reform campaigner who won compensation from the CPS after her rape case was dropped amidclaims she could have had an episode of “sexsomnia”, said the pilot was “a hugely important step in the right direction”.“After my own case was closed due to a controversial ‘sexsomnia’ defence, I used the victims’ right to review – only to be told that, despite the CPS admitting a mistake, it was too late to reopen the case because they’d already offered no evidence in court. That experience was devastating,” she said.“I’ve spent nearly three years campaigning behind the scenes for this exact change: for victims to have the opportunity to request a second review before a case is shut down.”She added that, despite its failure in her case, the CPS had shown a willingness to reflect and change and that her “faith in the agencies that once failed me is slowly being restored”.Ministers hope the change will help build trust in the justice system,which has been eroded by lengthy waiting times. In latest quarterly crime data released by the Ministry of Justice running to December 2024, rape and sexual offences had reached a record high in the crown court’s backlog.The number of sexual offences waiting to go to the crown court was 11,981, up by 41% in two years. There were 3,489 adult rape cases waiting to go to trial, an increase of 70% in two years.According to figures published by Rape Crisis, fewer than three in 100 rapes recorded by police in 2024 resulted in someone being charged that same year. Adult rape cases take an average of two years to complete in court, with many taking far longer.The pilot was welcomed by the End Violence Against Women Coalition and Centre for Women’s Justice.Helen Newlove, the victims’ commissioner for England and Wales, said it was “a first step toward ending a manifestly unfair practice that denied victims a voice and robbed them of justice”.Lucy Rigby, the solicitor general, said: “This government is treating violence against women and girls with the seriousness it deserves. Part of that is about empowering victims and improving their experience of the criminal justice system.”Siobhan Blake, CPS lead for rape and chief crown prosecutor of CPS West Midlands, said: “We know for rape victims, the prospect of their case being stopped can be absolutely devastating. Although they can request a review of our decision-making now, if we have already stopped the case in court, there is nothing that can be done to reactivate the case if that review comes to a different conclusion. In those circumstances we offer an apology, but appreciate that for a victim an apology rarely goes far enough or feels like a just outcome.“This pilot offers greater reassurance for victims. It means that they will be alerted to the prospect of their case being stopped earlier, so that they can ask for a review by a different prosecutor. If the original decision is reversed, then the case will continue but even if it can’t we hope that victims will have more confidence in the process and the earlier scrutiny of our decision-making.”Explore more on these topicsRape and sexual assaultViolence against women and girlsCrown Prosecution ServiceUK criminal justiceCrimeWomenEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

This is just the beginningElton JohnSpeaking at an awards event after the vote, Elton John said copyright protection was an “existential issue” for artists and urged the government “to do the right thing”.He added: “We will not let the government forget their promise to support our creative industries. We will not back down and we will not quietly go away. This is just the beginning.”Wednesday night’s vote prolongs a lengthy standoff between the Commons and Lords over the data bill, which has been used as a vehicle by campaigners to oppose the government’s proposed copyright reforms.Resistance to the changes in the Lords has been led byBeeban Kidron, a cross-bench peer and film director, whose amendments have been repeatedly backed by the upper chamber.The data bill now faces the prospect of being shelved unless the Commons accepts the Kidron amendment or proposes an alternative.Maggie Jones, the Lords minister for the digital economy and online safety, had urged peers to vote against the Kidron amendment after the government offered last-minute concessions in an attempt to stave off another defeat.Before the vote, Jones said peers were “choosing whether they want the entire bill to fall” and that by voting for Kidron’s amendment they would “countenance the unprecedented – to try to collapse a bill that does nothing to weaken copyright law” but included other important measures including to combat sexually explicit deepfake images.Kidron told peers: “This is our last chance to ask the government to provide a meaningful solution” and urged ministers to set out concrete steps to subject AI companies to copyright rules.“It is not fair, not reasonable, not just, balanced or any other such word to stand in the way of the creative industries identifying those who are taking their work or their property. It is not neutral – it is aiding and abetting what we have called in the house widespread theft.“We have asked privately and repeatedly on the floor of both houses what is the government going to do to stop the work of creatives from being stolen right now? The answer is nothing.”Several peers pushed back against the suggestion that the Lords’ move was unprecedented and said the government was itself breaking precedent by not compromising. Tim Clement-Jones, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for the digital economy, offered his party’s “staunch support” for Kidron’s amendment.View image in fullscreenBeeban Kidron said a question had to be asked – why did the government feel unable to protect UK interests and want to give away the country’s riches and jobs?Photograph: Carl Court/GettyThe Lords’ move puts the data bill in double insistence territory. This means the Commons and Lords cannot reach agreement over legislation. In this scenario, under parliamentary convention, the bill would fall unless ministers accept the rebel amendment or offer an alternative. A bill falling is extremely rare but not without precedent – it happened to the European parliamentary elections bill in the 1997-98 session.Under parliamentary convention, the Commons has primacy as the elected house, and in rare instances where the Lords refuses to back down ministers can resort to the Parliament Act to pass the bill in the next parliamentary session. This would significantly delay the legislation.In concessions offered to peers on Tuesday night, the government said it would commit to publishing further technical reports on the future of AI and copyright regulation and do so within nine months instead of 12.“A number of noble Lords have voiced concerns during ping-pong that the government is not listening. This is simply not the case,” Jones said in her letter, reiterating that ministers regretted the way the Lords rebels had gone about the changes.Jones stressed that the data bill was expected to generate £10bn of economic benefit by updating data protection law and that it would improve online safety, including by strengthening powers to ask social media companies to preserve data after the death of a child.Kidron said: “It is in the gift of the government to accept the amendment, or put something meaningful in its place. They have failed to listen to the Lords, they have failed to listen to the creative sector, they have failed to listen to their own backbenchers.”Under the government’s proposals, AI companies would be allowed to train their models using copyrighted work without permission unless the owner opts out. The plans have beenfiercely criticised by creators and publishersincluding high-profile artists such as Paul McCartney and Tom Stoppard.Peter Kyle, the technology secretary, has said heregretted the decisionto launch a consultation on changing copyright law with the opt-out system as the “preferred option”. Campaigners against the changes believe that there is resistance inside Downing Street to making more substantial concessions.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Intellectual propertyHouse of LordsHouse of CommonsBeeban KidronLabournewsShareReuse this content"

He should have been released in September on the completion of his last sentence. Doctors have warned she is in a highly dangerous condition, and are surprised she is conscious.Must Laila Soueif die from her hunger strike in London before her son Alaa Abd el-Fattah is released? | Helena KennedyRead moreIt is understood Starmer has been trying to speak to Abdel Fatah al-Sisi ever since she was hospitalised, but after taking two previous calls earlier in the crisis, the Egyptian president is so far refusing to take a third. Starmer last spoke to Sisi on 22 May, and urged him to “end the anguish of the family”.A diplomatic source said Sisi is adamant that he does not regard Abd el-Fattah as anything to do with Britain, since he won’t recognise his dual citizenship.“One can only assume he is indifferent to what happens to his mother, but we have been relaying through all the channels available how serious and urgent this matter is,” said one government source.The UK foreign secretary,David Lammy, has asked for options to be drawn up to demonstrate the UK’s anger at what has been happening, but the possibility that any will stick to make Sisi relent seem slim.The UK has not upgraded its travel advice for Egypt to “dangerous”.Starmer has enlisted the help of European allies to put pressure on Sisi to relent.Sending a message from her hospital bed, Soueif said she was overwhelmed by those who supported her. “I feel I have reaped what I have sowed hundred fold. All that is asked (of) us is that we don’t stop fighting for what is right. We do not have to be winning, but I believe there will come a time when we prevail.”Laila’s daughter, Sana’a, said on Tuesday that the doctors believed her mother may have found a limited pocket of energy. “She is fighting, and we hope the Foreign Office is using the time,” she said, adding that her brother is aware of his mother’s plight.Sana’a said that along with her sister Mono, they had already told the doctors that if she loses consciousness, they would not ask to revive her.She explained: “Our mother has told us: ‘I had a good and happy life. I had a good marriage and I had a good job and lived 69 years. I do not want to sit and watch my grandchildren’s life be stolen. It has been 10 years.’“Of course I do not want to lose my mum, but I also do not want her to go through this hospital business again. The only reason she wants to stay alive is us. She really does not want to continue life like this and I understand it.”She said Lammy had called for the ambassador’s access to Whitehall departments to be limited while he was in opposition. “He was very happy to say this when the Tories were in power, but it is not happening now.”John McDonnell, the independent MP who has been at the forefront of the campaign to bring the family’s plight to parliament, said: “My concern is that we are running out of time.“There is a whole range of things that specialists and diplomats have advised the government to do around trade and travel advice. There do not as yet seem to be any consequences.”Explore more on these topicsEgyptForeign policyActivismHuman rightsKeir StarmerDavid LammynewsShareReuse this content"

Higher tariffs “will more effectively counter foreign countries that continue to offload low-priced, excess steel and aluminum in the United States market and thereby undercut the competitiveness of the United States steel and aluminum industries”, the order said.The increase applies toall trading partners except Britain, the only country so far that has struck a preliminary trade agreement with the US during a 90-day pause on a wider array of Trump tariffs. The rate for steel and aluminum imports from the UK – which does not rank among the top exporters of either metal to the US – will remain at 25% until at least 9 July.About a quarter of all steel used in the US is imported and data shows the increased levies will hit the closest US trading partners – Canada and Mexico – especially hard. They rank first and third respectively in steel shipment volumes to the US.The office of Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister, said Canada was “engaged in intensive and live negotiations to have these and other tariffs removed”.Mexico’s economy minister, Marcelo Ebrard, reiterated that the tariffs were unsustainable and unfair, especially given that Mexico imports more steel from the US than it exports there.“It makes no sense for the United States to levy a tariff on a product in which you have a surplus,” he said, adding that Mexico would on Friday seek an exemption from the increase.Days afterannouncing his approval of the controversial takeoverof US Steel by Japan’s Nippon Steel, Trumpunveiled plans for the rapid increase in tariffson overseas steel and aluminum.“Our steel and aluminum industries are coming back like never before,” Trump posted. “This will be yet another BIG jolt of great news for our wonderful steel and aluminum workers.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just look at his trade cases: on again, off again.”Trump ditched his opposition to the deal – which Joe Bidenblockedin January, citing national security concerns – last week, claiming it would create tens of thousands of jobs.At Friday’sPennsylvaniarally, the president also announced he was doubling US tariffs on foreign steel to 50%. “This will be yet another BIG jolt of great news for our wonderful steel and aluminum workers,” he later claimed on social media.As Nippon looks to swoop on US Steel, however, staff are still waiting on clarity.“Are we still going to be employed when this whole thing goes through, and are there going to be improvements to our plant?” Mikayla Prescott, a worker at the Irvin site where Trump spoke on Friday,told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.“If it’s not benefiting the workers,” she added, “then what’s the point?”Following his retirement in 2016, May has followed international trade deals involving steel and watched the negative impacts offoreign steel importson the US industry.May said the president “recognized [the] disenchantment and anger” over the decline of the US steel industry but expressed distrust and disapproval of Trump’s rhetoric and promises in supporting the deal.While the deal is said to include a “golden share” that will be issued to the federal government, details have not been disclosed. US Steel hascharacterizedthe deal as an acquisition.United Steel Workers, which did not participate in the discussions around the acquisition of US Steel, hasnotedNippon Steel has been found to have violated US trade laws in 13 different cases.The union’s most recent contract with US Steel, signed in 2022 and set to expire at the end of 2026,represents 11,000 workersat the company.US Steel bought the Granite City plant, where May used to work, out of bankruptcy in 2003. The plant wastemporarily idledfor months in 2009 due to the recession, the first time in the plant’s over 100-year history, and following another idling of the plant in December 2015, US Steel announced in March 2018 it was reopening the plant,citingTrump’s 25% tariffs on steel imports.“We are once again pouring American steel into the spine of our country,” the president, then in his first term, declared at a rally at Granite City. “You are the ones who are making America great again.”May disputed Trump, or his tariffs, as the reason for the reopening, which he suggested was a result of the cyclical nature of the industry. In 2016, the US Steel chief executive had said the plant was idled due to market conditions and that it would be brought back when conditions improve.“Granite City was going to start back up anyway,” said May. “They don’t just flip a switch just because Trump came to town.”Despite Trump’s promises in 2018 to bring back “hope and prosperity” to Granite City, problems continued. The plant’s blast furnace wasidledpartially in 2019,then its second was idledin late 2023, which US Steelblamedon the autoworkers’ strike at the big three automakers. United Steel Workersarguedthe decision was a targeted attack on unionized workers.“If Trump really had steel workers’ backs, he wouldn’t be makinganti-union appointmentsto the National Labor Relations Board,” May added. “He wouldn’t bedecimatingOsha [the Occupational Safety and Health Administration]. He wouldn’t be doing everything he’s done: a long list of things that prove that he’s not supportive of unions.”May said: “The ‘partnership’ that those at the rally are celebrating, despite scant details of investments being shared, could become your very nemesis in a short period of time. Solidarity with USW leadership and members across the country is critical going forward. Once the shit hits the fan, commitments are unfulfilled,non-union electric arc furnace actionswill be used as a contract bargaining weapon and the rally is a forgotten memory.”There is a “vast difference between public relations and putting commitments in writing”, McCall, the USW president, said in a statement last week. “Issuing press releases and making political speeches is easy. Binding commitments are hard,” he said.“The devil is always in the details, and that is especially true with a bad actor like Nippon Steel that has again and again violated our trade laws, devastating steel communities in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.”US Steel did not respond to multiple requests for comment on criticisms from United Steel Workers on the deal.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS economyPennsylvaniaSteel industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The recent disapproval has been led by Musk, who denounced the measure as a “disgusting abomination” on his X platform on Tuesday.“This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,” Musk wrote. “Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong.”Then on Wednesday, he began to outline his suggested path forward.“We need a new bill that doesn’t grow the deficit,” hewrote on X. “A new spending bill should be drafted that doesn’t massively grow the deficit and increase the debt ceiling by 5 TRILLION DOLLARS,” headded.The House speaker, Mike Johnson, acknowledged tensions with Musk, telling reporters he had spoken with Trump about the criticism. “He’s not delighted that Elon did a 180 on that,” Johnson said.The legislation extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts while making deep spending reductions, primarily through cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, and passed the House by a single vote last month with no Democratic support. On Tuesday, the Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor-Greeneadmittedshe had missed a section of the bill text that was meant to regulate AI over the next 10 years, something she says would have made her vote against it. The week prior, the Nebraska representative Mike Flood said he glossed over another part of the bill about federal judges enforcing contempt orders.The CBO analysis found the bill would leave 10.9 million more Americans without health insurance by 2034, including 1.4 million people “without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status” who would lose coverage under state-funded programs.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, dismissed the projections, claiming the budget office has become “partisan and political”. She alleged CBO staff members have not contributed to Republican candidates since 2000 while many have donated to Democrats.Johnson had a similar take on the CBO, and defended the legislation, claiming it represents unprecedented spending cuts. “No government in the history of mankind has ever cut $1.6tn in a piece of legislation,” he told reporters. Earlier in the week, he said 84% of its budget analysts were “partisan Democrats” who donate to “Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren”.The Senate is expected to consider modifying the legislation in coming weeks, with Republican leaders hoping to pass a final version by early July.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpBudgetUS politicsUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

While Loïs Boisson and Mirra Andreeva feathered their first forehands of the warm-up, the French crowd cleared their throats with a forceful rendition of La Marseillaise. The message was clear: no matter how the match unfolded, they would be there with the home player until the end.All 15,000 of them were there to witness and encourage the extension of one of the most unexpected breakthrough runs in the history of tennis. Boisson, a French wildcard ranked No 361 and competing in her firstFrench Open, continued her incredible journey through the draw by toppling the sixth seed Andreeva 7-6 (6), 6-3 to reach the semi-finals.Coco Gauff scraps past Madison Keys to reach French Open semi-finalsRead moreOn Thursday she will face Coco Gauff, the American No 2 seed, who held her nerve after a difficult start to defeatthe Australian Open champion Madison Keys6-7 (6), 6-4, 6-1.Boisson had never defeated a player ranked inside the top 90 or even faced a top-50 opponent before she took her first steps on the clay courts at Roland Garros as a main-draw entrant 10 days ago. The 22-year-old had just one tour-level win, a match in Rouen two months ago, which generated significant attention after her British opponent, Harriet Dart,claimed she had body odour. Despite her lack of experience at the highest level, Boisson is now the lowest-ranked grand slam semi-finalist in 40 years and only the third player since 1989 to reach the semis at her first major tournament after Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati.Boisson entered the tournament as the 24th-ranked tennis player in France – she will leave Paris as her country’s new No 1.“I think every kid who plays tennis has the dream to win a slam,” she said. “More for French players to win Roland Garros, for sure. It’s a dream. For sure I will go for the dream, because my dream is to win it, not to be in the semi-final. So I will try to do my best for it.”Although underdog stories come easily, there has never been anything like this. One year ago, she was granted a French Open main draw wildcard after a few encouraging tournaments on the lower level ITF circuit. A week before the biggest occasion of her life, Boisson tore an anterior cruciate ligament at a small warm-up tournament in Paris. Six painful months of rehabilitation followed.View image in fullscreenLoïs Boisson at the end of the match.Photograph: Yoan Valat/EPAOne year later, having made positive steps in her few tournaments back, she was granted another shot at Roland Garros with a wildcard. She had already seized the moment with astounding vigour and self-belief, beating four quality players en route to the quarter-finals, including a deliriousthree-set win over the No 3 seed Jessica Pegula.However, Andreeva posed a completely different challenge. One of the best young talents to emerge in recent years, the 18-year-old had established herself as a genuine title contender this year.Despite the French crowd’s desperation to get involved in the match, Andreeva controlled the early exchanges, outsmarting Boisson with her superior court sense and well-timed drop shots while lasering down-the-line backhands at will. The Russian took a 5-3 lead and held a set point on Boisson’s serve.Throughout this week, Boisson has shown beyond doubt that she is a talented player with a distinct, tricky game. She pairs her wicked, heavy topspin forehand with a potent serve, excellent athleticism and ample variation, including a sweet feel on her drop shots.As Boisson settled into the match, she began to inflict damage on Andreeva. With every successful point, the crowd further enveloped the match. “It’s normal that [they] would support a French player, so I knew that it’s going to be like this,” Andreeva said.“I think that in the first set I mana­ged it pretty well. I didn’t really pay attention to that, but with nerves and with pressure, it became a little harder. But, anyway, I think that I can learn from this, so nothing more I can say for now.”Under suffocating pressure from a formidable opponent, her own ambitions and a bloodthirsty audience that jubilantly cheered every point she lost, Andreeva – who won at Indian Wells in March – fell apart. Her forehand disintegrated as she served for the set at 5-4 and then she began to struggle with her serve. As her composure eventually crumbled, Boisson played with courage and determination in the biggest moment of her career to close out another unforgettable victory.“I don’t think it’s a miracle,” ­Boisson said. “For sure, I have a little bit of luck also, but I think it’s just the hard work that I put since I started ­playing tennis and also last year with my rehab and everything. It’s just the result of hard work. Nothing else.”Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025French OpenTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Reality is very differentWhile American women such as Serena Williams and Coco Gauff have thrived at Roland-Garros, their male counterparts are making slow progressOwen LewisWed 4 Jun 2025 12.53 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 18.56 EDTShareThe most shocking moment of the 2024psychosexual tennis film Challengersis not the traumatic knee injury, any frame from the quasi-sex scenes, or the passionate rally with which the movie concludes. It’s the reveal that one of the characters, American ATP tennis player Art Donaldson, has won the French Open twice, a stat so foreign to US men we must have a sequel simply for Donaldson to explain how he found success on clay.No American man has lifted the trophy – or even made the semi-finals – on the Parisian clay courts since Andre Agassi did so in 1999. And at the time of Challengers’ release, no American man had made the quarter-finalssince (bet you won’t guess this one) Agassi in 2003. American women have a storied history on clay – Chris Evert’s seven Roland-Garros titles and 125-match winning streak on the surface are legend; Serena Williams won Roland-Garros three times;Coco Gauffgoes deep there every year and isback in the semi-finals this time– but the men, outside a brief burst in the 1980s and 1990s, have had little luck in the Open era. The 21st-century union between American men and Parisian clay courts is, somehow, more distant and fraught than Art’s relationship with his wife, Tashi, in Challengers.Wildcard Boisson drinks in French Open fairytale run after reaching semisRead moreThe former of those relationships may be getting a tad more affectionate though. At Roland-Garros this year, Americans Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe broke the 22-year quarter-final drought. Tiafoe, previously an unaccomplished clay player, dialed in his whipped forehand and bunted backhand and didn’t drop a set en route to the last eight. Paul scrapped to get there, gritting out a comeback from two sets down against the musclebound Marton Fucsovics and a marathon against Karen Khachanov despite a lower ab injury and a relative lack of raw pace on his shots. A smattering of other Americans fell short of the quarter-finals, but impressed nonetheless: Ben Sheltonpushed defending champion Carlos Alcarazto a tight four sets, unheralded Ethan Quinn made the third round.So no Art Donaldson heroics here, but certainly reason for optimism. The question is how much. The American men’s runs ended abruptly and with little struggle. Paul’s physical issues intensified, making him ideal prey that Alcaraz feasted ravenously on in the quarter-finals: 6-0, 6-1, 6-4. And Tiafoe lost in four sets to Lorenzo Musetti, a clay-courter by trade,accounting for himself welluntil 5-5 in a decisive third set before losing eight of the final 10 games.The matches outlined the highest standard of play on the slow, shifting clay surface. “Tiafoe ran up against somebody who really is a clay-courter,” Steve Tignor, a longtime senior writer forTennis.com, said on Tuesday. “He hadn’t lost a set, but I don’t know if he’d played anybody who was a really top-tier clay-court guy, who could really make him hit a lot of balls.” We spoke before Alcaraz-Paul, but asked about Paul’s potential to win the match, Tignor said, “I don’t really give him too serious a chance.”In an early rally against Alcaraz, Paul got off some of his best groundstrokes, steadily pushing Alcaraz from side to side while improving his own court position. But on the run, from miles beyond the baseline,Alcaraz suddenly uncorked a forehand down the linethat blazed past Paul. The shot signified the tennis gods’ uneven distribution of gifts. Such power, so far outside Paul’s capabilities and so comfortably within Alcaraz’s, cannot be acquired or taught, only identified and honed.Even if Tiafoe or Paul had made the final, world No 1 Jannik Sinner most likely would have been waiting. Sinner hits heavy and hard with no cost to accuracy, a living nightmare of an opponent. “Sinner already seems like a guy, maybe even more than Alcaraz, who’s just going to stand in the way of the Americans,” Tignor said. “I imagine if any of the Americans had come up against him [at Roland-Garros], they would have lost.”In April,Tiafoe told Reem Abulleilthat tennis is more open since the end of the Big Three era: “Anybody can win slams.” In the wake of the retirements of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, plus Novak Djokovic finally showing signs of slowing down, this figured to be an accurate take on the new tennis world order. Empirical evidence so far suggests otherwise. Sinner and Alcaraz have shared the last five major titles and are in their early 20s. They look intent on spending the next decade gradually proving Tiafoe’s quote wrong.Paul and Tiafoe performed as well as can be expected at Roland-Garros. So what’s the future for the American men on clay, this surface once more ruled by generational talents? There seems to be no room for mere mortals, but that’s hardly the mortals’ fault. They’ll keep trying, keep improving, and perhaps eventually this country of 340 million will once again produce a men’s Roland-Garros champion. Until then, American fans can best do justice to their rooting interests by respecting the enormity of the task.Explore more on these topicsFrench OpenFrench Open 2025TennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The game wasn’t even close. The Thunder outplayed them on both sides of the court.Defensively, Thunder coach Mark Daigneault put the 6ft 5in Alex Caruso on in the 6ft 11in Nikola Jokić and, surprisingly, it worked. With Chet Holmgren or Isaiah Hartenstein providing help-side support, I watched a frustrated Jokić struggle to get to his spots. His usual tricks – flopping, drawing fouls – didn’t work. The Thunder defense moved in perfect sync, and it completely disrupted Denver’s rhythm.It was absolutely beautiful to watch.

In the Game 5 win that sealed the Thunder’s progress to theNBA finals, I watched them destroy the Timberwolves and defense was once again the key. Minnesota’s Anthony Edwards described the Thunder’s defense as: “One string, 15 puppets on one string.”The New York Knicks’ season is over, but a divisive inquest has only just begunRead moreThat’s what’s driven their rise all year. In a league where defense is often overlooked or criticized, the Thunder have made it their identity. And now, they’re just four wins away from anNBAtitle.But as I have been enjoying this current Thunder team, I can’t help but think back to the Thunder team I played for in 2010.The Thunder are heavily favored to beat the Indiana Pacers in the NBA finals, which start on Thursday, and they are the youngest team to ever make the finals since … the Thunder did so with a whole different cast in 2012. But I can say with 100% confidence, that if the Thunder kept that team – with Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka – they would have won multiple championships.Back in 2009-2010, when I was part of the roster, the Thunder were extremely young. Scott Brooks was the coach. It was James Harden’s rookie year. I remember when I first met him, he shook my hand and said: “Nice to meet you sir. I grew up watching you play in college with Syracuse. You was blocking everything and dunking everything”That’s when I realized I was now the old man in the room. But it also hit me – Harden was in the same position I’d once been in when I joined the Washington Wizards as a rookie, meeting guys like Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Charles Oakley and Christian Laettner.View image in fullscreenNBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has led this version of the Thunder with distinction.Photograph: Zach Beeker/NBAE/Getty ImagesThroughout that season, myself, Kevin Ollie and Nick Collison, who were some of the elder statesmen on the team, would sit and watch the younger guys, shaking our heads and saying, “These young cats have no idea how good they are going to be”.It all started with KD.He was the youngest player to ever lead the league in scoring at the time. And his work ethic was something I had never seen before.I remember after one practice, KD was doing this drill he liked – playing one-on-one against an invisible defender. But he went at it with the intensity of someone competing in the NBA finals. Every move was as sharp and deliberate as possible. Everything was at game speed.After practice, we all went in – showered, ate, got treatment, talked. Some of the coaches watched film with players. Then we came back out to the court, and KD was still out there, going full speed with his one-on-one moves. Dripping with sweat. He’d been at it for nearly two hours.I had never seen that kind of focus before. But when the team’s star is working that hard, everyone else falls in line-and that’s exactly what happened. The whole team rose to his level. Even after someone had a big game, they were back in the gym the next day, working like they’d just lost. They were running defensive slides and drills in the middle of the season, when most teams were cutting practice time.Harden fell right in line and worked hard every day. Even when he made rookie mistakes, he picked up the work ethic quickly. It was clear – if KD didn’t have a problem being criticized, Harden couldn’t either.I watched Harden study KD closely – how hard he worked on his shot, his offensive moves, his cuts to the basket, how he moved without the ball. Even after dropping 40 the night before, KD went right back to work. And Harden noticed.Then there was Russell Westbrook – fearless, relentless. He trained harder than anyone and played like a Tasmanian devil, all intensity and energy. He’d pick up full court, never taking a play off. I remember Coach Brooks telling the staff, “If we don’t get this guy to slow down, he’s going to wear himself out.” But he never did. He just kept going – full speed, all the time.Westbrook was being mentored by Maurice Cheeks, who really took him under his wing, guiding and encouraging him. I remember hearing them talk on the plane after games – you could feel the intensity and passion in Russ’s voice. That hunger was real, and it was going to take him far. And it did.Then there was Jeff Green – one of the most underappreciated players on that Thunder team, in my opinion. He was an integral part of their success. He never complained about shots, touches, or a lack of recognition. He just showed up and did his job. Too quick for most power forwards, too strong for most small forwards, and incredibly efficient. He didn’t back down from anyone. And his ability to guard positions 2 through 5 made him invaluable.Ibaka was young, athletic, and raw – but he was soaking everything in. He watched KD’s work ethic, Westbrook’s intensity, Green’s professionalism, Harden’s shooting (he even did all the shooting drills Harden did on his own time), and Thabo Sefolosha’s defensive awareness. Thabo, by the way, was also a key part of that team.Let me be clear: I’m not placing blame on the organization or any player for why this group didn’t stay together and become a dynasty. But the talent was there. And they were only going to get better. This will go down as one of the biggest what-ifs in NBA history – notifthey would’ve won a title together, buthow manythey could have won if they’d stayed together.This current OKC team has similar levels of talent. But this time, there’s a real chance to finish what they started. And with the NBA finals starting Thursday, they have the chance to begin a championship run – one that could last for years.Explore more on these topicsOklahoma City ThunderNBANBA finalsBasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But there are plenty of talking points off the ice tooColin HorganWed 4 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 07.14 EDTShareThis time last year the story of the Stanley Cup final between Florida and Edmonton was mostly about Connor McDavid, hockey’s generational talent, getting the chance to bring the Cupback to hockey’s generational home. And it almost went his way, after the Oilers overcame a three-game deficitto force a deciding Game 7. Instead, McDavid’s win came a little later. His series-winning goal against the USin February’s Four Nations Cupamid the febrile nationalism created by Donald Trump’s annexation threats and tariffs seemed to quiet the doubters about where hockey both belonged and who rightly owned its highest honours. But here we are again, on the eve of the final, with the Oilers back in Florida for the second season in a row – Game 1 is on Wednesday night – and with a team from that state contending for the Cup for the sixth straight year.The easiest way to explain why the Tampa Bay Lightning (2020-22) andFlorida Panthers(2023-25) have each reached the Stanley Cup final as Eastern Conference champions in three consecutive seasons is that, well, they have both been very good teams. You can point to some common elements between the two, like scoring depth, a certain level of tenacity and grit, elite Russian goaltending, and Carter Verhaeghe. But there has also been something less obvious or quantifiable about these teams. Some characteristic that they share, beyond the on-ice talent and performance. It may be Florida itself.Stuck on repeat: NHL’s playoff format keeps delivering déjà vu matchupsRead moreThere’s the income tax rate, for one thing, in that there isn’t one. Given that, the common refrain goes, Florida teams have an inherent advantage when free agents are looking for a new place to play. Indeed, Lightning general manager Julien BriseBois confirmed it last summer, telling reporters that Florida’s “favourable tax situation” had helped entice players to sign. The Associated Pressran the numberson Sam Reinhart’s new deal at $8.625m per year. In Florida, he will owe $3.15m in annual taxes – $1.1m less than if he lived in California, and $1.4m less than if he was in Toronto. Then again, there are no state income taxes in Tennessee, either, and Nashville finished third-last in the NHL last year. None in Texas, either. No Cups there recently. Nor in Washington. So, maybe there’s more to it – less bureaucratic and more geographic reasons, like the beach and the weather. Or it could be the vibe.“Nothing in Florida is ever quite what it seems,” former Tampa Bay Tribune reporter Craig Pittman wrote inhis book about the state, adding that “in Florida, the crimes tend to be weirder and the scams bigger.” Florida is where all the “nation’s unctuous elements tend to trickle down as if [it] were the grease trap under America’s George Foreman grill,” Kent Russell wrotein the New York Times. Both writers made those assessments in the summer of 2016. Since then, Florida has had quite the decade. And even for what was already America’s strangest state, it’s been an interesting few years. Much of that is due to Donald Trump’s ascension to the US presidency – twice – not in his original big-suited, big-dealing New York City tycoon form, but as something much weirder, angrier, and noticeably more sunkissed: that is, as a kind of alpha Florida Man.Of course, all of that might have had little or nothing to do with hockey had it not been for Trump’s personal vendetta against Canada this year, all but vowing to annex it as the 51st state. Or if Wayne Gretzky wasn’t such a staunchTrump supporter– a fact thathas made himpersona non grata in the country he once led to Olympic gold. Or if Gary Bettman (and Gretzky) hadn’t beenhanging outwith Trump-nominated FBI director Kash Patel at Capitals games. Or if a Panthers minority owner hadn’tcalleda Toronto Maple Leafs supporter an “51st anti semite loser” on X last month. But all that stuff did happen, both setting and capturing the tone of the season, hounded at every turn by a Florida Man. To no small degree, it would make an Oilers win all the more satisfying for many Canadians.Still, even if none of that off-ice stuff had happened, there is still undeniably a high level of that brash, unapologetic, and moderately crazed Florida attitude in the Panthers. They might not all be men from Florida, but they sure feel like Florida Men. It’s by sheer coincidence that the Panthers’ spirit animal is not the team’s namesake catbut is instead a rat. But let’s be honest, it fits with how many see the team (and not just because Brad “the rat” Marchand plays there now – that’s just fate). Because, as much as you might respect the rat’s hustle or its capacity to survive against long odds – as the Panthers did during their 2023 Cup run, beating the seemingly unbeatable Boston Bruins in the first round – most of the time you want them to go away for ever.Yet, the life of a rat is also a story of a certain kind of success. It’s no easy feat to find your way when everyone hates you. Still harder to do it more than once. “Part of Florida’s appeal is that it’s the Land of a Thousand Chances, the place where people go who have screwed up elsewhere and need to start over,” Pittman wrote. He was thinking of guys like Carlo Ponzi, creator of the Ponzi scheme. But you could just as easily point to someone like Verhaeghe, who spent six years in the AHL and ECHL after being drafted before the Lightning and Panthers gave him a chance. Now he’s a two-time Cup winner.Connor McDavid and the Oilers have a second chance in Florida now, too. Another opportunity to make the rats go away. Of course, that won’t be easy. The Panthers are relentlessly tenacious, with an aggressive offensive pinch. They’re gritty, some may even say dirty. And they’ve proven that they can scrape and scramble to the top. Just like the state they call home.Explore more on these topicsStanley CupFlorida PanthersEdmonton OilersNHLIce hockeyUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Italian left Inter on Tuesday after the side's humiliating 5-0 loss in the Champions League final against Paris Saint-Germain last Saturday, and has quickly taken on another managerial job.The Saudi club did not immediately disclose any details about Inzaghi's contract, but Italian media reported that it could be worth up to €30m (£25.3m) per season. Inzaghi's first task will be to take charge of Al-Hilal at the Club World Cup in the US; they will face Real Madrid on 18 June in their group opener.Earlier on Wednesday, Cesc Fàbregas pledged his immediate managerial future to Como amid speculation that the Spaniard is Inter's main target to replace Inzaghi.The former Arsenal, Barcelona and Chelsea midfielder has attracted the attention of several top clubs after leading promoted Como to 10th place in Serie A.'I really believe in Como's long-term project, I arrived here as a player and I'm very, very happy because I can work here the way I want,\" Fàbregas, who is also a shareholder in the club he manages, said at the SXSW (South By Southwest) conference in London. Italian media have reported that Inter want to speak to Fàbregas after Inzaghi left by mutual agreement on Tuesday.ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Martínez made a triple change just before the hour mark, with Juventus winger Conceição replacing Francisco Trinçao on the right side. It was Conceição who changed the game five minutes later, cutting in from the right, driving towards goal and finding the far corner with a 25-yard effort that swerved and dipped.That seemed like a good omen for Portugal – Francisco’s father, Sérgio, scored a hat-trick the last time they beat Germany, at Euro 2000. So it proved five minutes later as Bruno Fernandes played in Nuno Mendes, whose cross found Ronaldo just onside, six yards out, to slot past Marc-André ter Stegen for his 137th international goal.Germany came close to an equaliser when substitute Karim Adeyemi struck the near post from a tight angle, but in the latter stages it was Portugal who looked more likely to score as Julian Nagelsmann’s team ran out of ideas.View image in fullscreenFrancisco Conceiçao (bottom left) beats Marc-André ter Stegen with a long-range strike.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APConceição, who was named player of the match, sent a powerful strike just wide, while Ter Stegen made a miraculous double save to deny substitute Diogo Jota and then Conceição’s shot on the rebound in the dying moments.Still, Portugal’s work was done, and the 2019 Nations League winners advance to a final against either 2021 champions France or the current holders, Spain, at the same venue on Sunday night.“We need to enjoy the victory – we won for the first time in a while against Germany,” Martínez said afterwards. “Tactically we were exceptional and our commitment helped ... it was a team victory. Now we can recover and evaluate … we want another performance with personality in this shirt.”“The defeat is absolutely deserved,” the Germany captain Kimmich said. “We weren’t playing well enough in the first half [and] after going 1-0 up, nothing came of it.

Does women’s football have too many international windows? Does the game offer enough support for players’ wellbeing? And have Chelsea and England rotated and rested players such as Bright sufficiently in the past few years?Second, it should offer anybody else who is not feeling fully fit mentally the reassurance that they are not alone and that – ultimately – nothing is more important than your health. In short, sport would be a much healthier place if more athletes felt empowered to make the difficult decision that Bright has taken.For England, however, in the short term, her absence will undoubtedly leave them weaker for Euro 2025 next month, together with the retirements from international football ofMary EarpsandFran Kirby, in what has turned into surely the most tumultuous week of Sarina Wiegman’s otherwise hugely successful tenure.The European champions will go to the European Championship without three vastly experienced players who have a combined 218 senior caps. That sort of knowhow and leadership will be tricky to replace, even though it will offer young talents a chance to thrive.View image in fullscreenMary Earps celebrates with team-mate Millie Bright during their victorious Euro campaign in 2022. Neither will be in the England team this summer for their title defence.Photograph: Steve Bardens/UEFA/Getty ImagesThere will naturally be many people alarmed by the trio of high‑profile withdrawals. However, each has come for individual reasons. Earps is understood to have been contemplating her decision for more than a year. Kirby had already planned to retire from England duty after Euro 2025 and has brought that move forward after being informed – after “honest conversations” – that she would not be selected in the final squad. Bright revealed in May that she was withdrawing from the games against Portugal and Spain, telling the Daly Brightness podcast last week: “Mentally and physically, I’m probably at my limits. We are humans, we’re not robots. At some point, things will take their toll on you and I just needed time to breathe and switch off.”Nonetheless, there are some questions for Wiegman. On the one hand, her determination to have honest conversations with players about their chances of selection for Euro 2025 will be welcomed by those who appreciate the transparency, but did the England head coach decide too soon that Kirby would not be picked? Was that not a risk, before England’s match against Spain, in case another player who plays in Kirby’s position picked up an injury?Similarly, while both goalkeepers will probably have been glad to hear such honesty and clarity from their coach, was it definitely necessary for Wiegman to decide that Hampton was her No 1 for the European Championship so early – as has been widely reported – rather than encouraging both players to keep battling for the starting jersey and pushing each other to keep improving? We will never know for certain whether that could have made any difference in delaying Earps’s retirement. It was a big call for the Dutchwoman to make, although one where she was possibly in a no-win situation; delay the decision and the topic of “Who is your No 1 keeper?” would have been asked at every media session until England face France on 5 July.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Carli Lloyd played for her country until she was 39. Alex Morgan was almost 35 when she played her final USA fixture last year. More recently, in December, Becky Sauerbrunn announced her retirement aged 39.For England to say farewell to Earps, aged 32, and Kirby, aged 31, and be without 31-year-old Bright this summer, raises questions for the camp internally about whether or not enough is being done to help sustain the careers of these icons and help them to continue thriving at the elite level for as long as those USA stars did.Rachel Daly also retired last year from Lionesses duty at 32.Everything should be looked at from schedules, calendars and recovery periods, to mental wellbeing support, nutrition and whether the environment could be improved, because the national team are saying goodbye to fans’ favourites too soon.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamMary EarpsMillie BrightWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

But the focus since Monday has been to look at the bigger picture, which has involved monitoring the reaction of the players to extreme temperatures – with the help of ­biometric tablets and innovative sports-science methods.Tuchel tells Alexander-Arnold to take England defensive role ‘very seriously’Read moreThe players have been asked to take a tablet and cycle for 45 ­minutes at a consistent level inside a tent that has been heated to a minimum of 35C. The Football Association’s experts have been able to track their core body temperatures under stress – with the idea being that it will inform how they manage them at the finals in the US, Canada and Mexico.Eze, who finished the domestic season on a high with the winner for Crystal Palacein the FA Cup finalagainst Manchester City, said it was the first time he had seen such an approach in training.“It was quite difficult to do,” he said. “It was taking the tablets and you had to be on the bike for 45 ­minutes, which is a long time to be on a bike.“You had to keep going and they monitored your heart rate, your actual temperature. It was just understanding and it was definitely helpful … a bit of an insight into ­yourself and how you will cope in those situations.”Cole Palmer, the Chelsea midfielder, said: “It was tough. It was 35C, 36C inside the tents and we had to get to a certain watts [level] on the bike and maintain it. For 45 minutes.”View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel talks to Cole Palmer at England training in Girona.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty ImagesEze has been on fire since he scored his first England goal in the 3-0 victoryagainst Latvia in late March, which was Tuchel’s second game in charge. The first was the 2-0 win against Albania three days before. Tuchel has talked about the goal having inspired Eze, who went back to Palace and finished the season with nine in 13 matches.The one that will always be remembered was against City to secure ­Palace’s first major trophy and a place in the Europa League, although there is a complication on that front because of the majority stake that the club’s co-owner, John Textor, holds in Lyon. The Ligue 1 club have also qualified for the Europa League.

The demand comes amid growing concern that not enough is being done to improve the conditions of workers as development begins to scale up before the FifaWorld Cup, due to take place in the Gulf state in 2034.Fifa breaching own human rights rules over Saudi Arabia World Cup, lawyers sayRead moreLuc Triangle, the general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, said the “scale and severity” of the issues in Saudi Arabia demanded the strongest response. “This is a call for immediate action towards genuine, inclusive and collaborative reform,” he said. “We cannot tolerate another death of a migrant worker in Saudi Arabia. We cannot remain silent while migrant workers, especially construction and domestic workers continue to face fundamental rights violations. This has to stop now.”The news comes on the day the ILO announced a new cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia, signed on the sidelines of its key annual gathering, the International Labour Conference, held in Geneva this week. Under the initial two-year agreement Saudi Arabia is expected to begin to align its laws with international labour standards.Human rights groups and trade unions have repeatedly warned that the World Cup, and other major projects, could be tarnished byabusive conditionsendured by migrant workers in constructing the necessary infrastructure. These concerns include extortionate recruitment fees, non-payment of wages, false contracts, passport confiscation and exposure toextreme heat. Thousands of workers could be likely to die as construction ramps up, the rights group FairSquareclaimedlast month.The number of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia has surged in recent years tomore than 13 million, driven in part by a massive construction boom linked to the World Cup and so-called giga-projects.View image in fullscreenA migrant worker is seen at a construction site near Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on 3 March 2024.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesSaudi Arabia’s agreement with the ILO is understood to include proposals for new measures to support fair recruitment and make it easier for workers to change jobs, the introduction of a minimum wage and the inclusion of migrant workers on workers’ representative committees. Trade unions remain prohibited in the country.The agreement also sets out commitments to improve the compensation system for workers who are injured or killed. In the longer term, it promises to strengthen protections for domestic workers, who have been excluded from key provisions of the labour law.The planned reforms have failed to satisfy trade union delegates. Trade unions from the UK, Japan, Canada, Australia and 13 African countries including Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal pushed through the complaint, despite fierce opposition from the Saudis. The complaint, which the Guardian has seen, lists dozens of cases of alleged human trafficking, forced labour, wage theft and physical and sexual abuse of migrant workers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although Scott is a big fan of the former Luton manager Rob Edwards, Gibson can expect to be inundated with applications from candidates attracted by the club’s impressive infrastructure and, on paper at least, relatively strong squad.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Contenders could include Sheffield Wednesday’s Danny Röhl, the former Nottingham Forest and Leicester manager Steve Cooper, the former Wolves head coach and Boro midfielder Gary O’Neil and the former Burnley and Everton manager Sean Dyche.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On a three-match losing streak while closing in on his 38th birthday, he had, in his own words, entered a “new reality”. Djokovic reasoned that his results simply reflected the circle of life. It was inevitable that the circle will eventually close.There was nothing at all new about the level exhibited by Djokovic on a glorious Thursday night in Paris as he turned back the clock with a vintage offering. Djokovic, the sixth seed in Paris, completely outplayed the third seed Alexander Zverev to return to the semi-finals of theFrench Openwith a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 victory.Wildcard Boisson drinks in French Open fairytale run after reaching semisRead moreDjokovic is the oldest man to reach the French Open semi-finals since Pancho Gonzales in 1968 and he has now reached 51 grand slam semi-finals, extending his own all-time record. “Tonight is one of those reasons why I still keep playing,” he said.Life will become more difficult for Djokovic when he faces world No 1Jannik Sinnerin the semi-final on Friday. Sinner continued his imperious march through the draw with an emphatic 6-1, 7-5, 6-0 win over Alexander Bublik of Kazakhstan. Sinner is still yet to drop a set and he has won 19 consecutive matches at grand slams after recent triumphs at the US Open and Australian Open.Djokovic entered Court Philippe-Chatrier with unfinished business after being forced to withdraw from his Australian Open semi-final against Zverev in January. He had produced a stellar performance to defeat Carlos Alcaraz in the last eight, fighting through a hamstring strain that finally downed him in Melbourne. Having started the year radiating confidence, that injury would prove the start of three extremely difficult months on the tour.On the eve of the French Open, Djokovic found his way again by winning his 100th career title at a small tournament in Geneva. Still it was unclear if he was truly ready to elevate his level against one of the best. The early exchanges further underlined the high standard required as Djokovic opened up the match with a sloppy service game against a locked-in Zverev, who immediately broke his serve. Zverev played an excellent opening set, serving brilliantly, imposing himself with his forehand and outlasting Djokovic in the attritional exchanges.View image in fullscreenAlexander Zverev (right) embraces Novak Djokovic after their men’s singles semi-final.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty ImagesNobody understands the ebb and flow of a best-of-five marathon like Djokovic, who calmly shrugged off the lost opening set. He built rhythm on his serve and tried to put as many returns in the court as possible while calmly waiting for his moment. At 2-1 in set two, Djokovic was rewarded for his patience. In his attempts to maintain pressure on the Serbian, tense unforced errors began to leak from Zverev’s racket, and Djokovic earned his first break.Having faced each other 13 previous occasions and trained together many more times, there are no secrets. Djokovic picked apart Zverev’s game the same way he has done many times before. He used his drop shot astoundingly well, continually taking advantage of the massive space left by Zverev’s deep court positioning with perfectly timed and executed drop shots and he served brilliantly in the decisive moments. Djokovic also chose his moments to serve and volley and was efficient when he approached the net. For a man with so many miles in his legs, his court coverage and durability remains staggering.As the match endured, Djokovic controlled the baseline with his forehand and when they found themselves locked in backhand exchanges, only Djokovic was willing to change direction and force his way out. He dismantled one of the best players in the world with surgical precision. Regardless of how the tournament continues, the fact that he can still compete at a high level at 38 is an incredible achievement in its own right.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His enormous serve, movement and physicality makes him an incredibly difficult opponent to face on almost any day and he has built a strong résumé during his years at the top.However, the story of Zverev’s career so far is that in the decisive moments of the grand slam tournaments, while the greatest players are desperate to seize the moment, he cowers. As Djokovic bulldozed his path to the semi-finals, it was clear that both players on the court knew this all too well.Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025Jannik SinnerNovak DjokovicFrench OpenTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Nonetheless, the decision is a big setback for ­Wiegman before the defence ofthe trophy England wonthree years ago, coming swiftly after the news of the retirements from international football of Mary Earps and Fran Kirby. All three players started every game of the Lionesses’ run to Euro 2022 glory, along with Rachel Daly, who retired from England duty last year, and the centre-forward Ellen White, who hung up her boots altogether after that triumph, meaning only six of the starting side from that historic success could be involved this time around.Bright has made a brave decision, but are England doing enough to support their stars?Read more“This is one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever had to make but after careful thought and discussions with my team, I have decided to withdraw from selection for the England squad ahead of Euro 2025,” Bright said on Instagram. “Football has given me so much and representing my country has always been my greatest honour. My pride and ego tells me to go but I think the team and the fans deserve more. Right now I’m not able to give 100% mentally or physically.“As much as I want to be out there running through brick walls for Eng­land and fighting alongside my teammates, stepping back is the right thing for my health, my future, the game and most importantly the team. It wouldn’t be fair for me to take the place and opportunity away from another player who is ready to give everything for the badge and country.”The 31-year-old, who has won 88 caps and scored six international goals, withdrew from England’s recent Nations League fixtures against Portugal and Spain to allow herself extra time to recover, ­telling the Daly Brightness podcast she had needed to look after her mental health as well as needing to let her body rest. Bright captained Chelsea to a domestic treble this season.On Wednesday the centre-back, who captained England in their run tothe 2023 World Cup final, said: “I’ll be supporting the team with everything I’ve got, and hoping this incredible group of players will do the nation proud. Thank you to my teammates, coaches and, most importantly, the fans for your unwavering support, it means the world to me.”However, there is positive news for Wiegman: three key players who had been long-term absentees with knee injuries – Lauren Hemp, Georgia Stanway and Alex Greenwood – all came through England’s recent matches against Portugal and Spain in good condition. The return of Greenwood in particular will be very welcome in that she can start at centre-back – the position she has played most commonly for her club, Manchester City – in Bright’s absence this summer.Additionally, Wiegman has saidshe is positiveregarding the Chelsea forward Lauren James’s chances of being fit, as she continues her recovery from a hamstring problem.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chelsea’s hotel sales were ultimately cleared by the Premier League after a lengthy assessment which concluded earlier this year. The process led to the value of the deal being restated, however, at £70.5m in Chelsea’s latest accounts, down from an original £76.5m.The west London sidehave also sold their women’s teamto a related company at a value of almost £200m last year, helping the club record a net profit of £129.6m for the year ended 30 June 2024.The Guardian understands that the league was asked by some clubs to table an amendment that would prevent such deals from being included in PSR calculations in future. That proposal was ultimately removed from a series of votes on rule changes, however, after it became clear there was insufficient support among the totality of clubs to pass it. All clubs attended the AGM on Wednesday knowing there would be no vote.This is not the first occasion that clubs have stepped back from changing the rules. Alterations were discussed first in 2021, when the EFL had brought in tougher rules, and then last summer, but no vote was taken on either occasion.The sale of fixed assets cannot be included in revenue under Uefa’s financial sustainability rules, however and the Blues are expected to have agree a potential financial settlement with European football’s governing body as a result.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

McIlroy had to switch heads early in the week at Quail Hollow after his driver was deemed non-conforming by a United States Golf Association test.The scenario is perfectly common – when club faces become too springy through overuse – and also happened to theeventual champion Scottie Scheffler. The process, though, is meant to be private.Former world No 5 Max Homa carries own bag at US Open qualifier after split from caddieRead moreMcIlroy did not address the media after any round at the US PGA, something he expanded on at the Canadian Open in Toronto on Wednesday. “The PGA was a bit of a weird week,”the Masters championsaid. “I didn’t play well. I didn’t play well the first day, so I wanted to go practise, so that was fine. Second day, we finished late. I wanted to go back and see [McIlroy’s daughter] Poppy before she went to bed. The driver news broke. I didn’t really want to speak on that.“Saturday, I was supposed to tee off at 8.20 in the morning. I didn’t tee off until almost 2 in the afternoon, another late finish, was just tired, wanted to go home. Then Sunday, I just wanted to get on the plane and go back to Florida.”McIlroy duly opened up on the specifics of his driver. “I was a little pissed off because I knew that Scottie’s driver had failed on Monday but my name was the one that was leaked. It was supposed to stay confidential. Two members of the media were the ones that leaked it.“I didn’t want to get up there and say something I regretted. I’m trying to protect Scottie. I don’t want to mention his name. I’m trying to protect TaylorMade. I’m trying to protect the USGA, PGA of America, myself.“With Scottie’s stuff, that’s not my information to share. I felt that process is supposed to be kept confidential and it wasn’t for whatever reason. That’s why I was pretty annoyed at that.”View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler won the US PGA despite his driver failing a test before the championship.Photograph: Jared C Tilton/Getty ImagesLost in this melee was that McIlroy’s driving accuracy statistics were decidedly poor at Augusta National and the month previously, whenhe won the Players Championship. His appearance in Canada serves in part as a buildup for the US Open at Oakmont next week and he admitted he has had to juggle fresh thoughts after winning the Masters, a success that completed the career grand slam.“I would certainly say that the last few weeks, I’ve had a couple of weeks off and going and grinding on the range for three or four hours every day is maybe a little tougher than it used to be,” the 36-year-old said. “You have this event in your life that you’ve worked towards and it happens, sometimes it’s hard to find the motivation to get back on the horse and go again.“The last two weeks have been good for me just as a reset, just to figure out where I’m at in my own head, what I want to do, where I want to play. I thought it was a good time to reset some goals. I’ve had a pretty good first half of the season and I want to have a good second half of the season now, too.”Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyGolfUS sportsScottie SchefflerUS PGAnewsShareReuse this content"

Gauff had previously not dropped a set as she quietly made her way through the friendlier side of the draw.In a nervy first set Gauff overturned a 4-1 deficit to force a set point at 5-4, only to be taken to a tie-break, which Keys won. Gauff went 4-1 up in the second but found herself pegged back, before a break and a hold took the match into a decider.The confidence had drained from Keys, the Australian Open champion, while Gauff finally located her serve, having coughed up nine double faults in the first two sets. A pass down the line brought up three match points and the 21-year-old roared with delight when Keys went long, giving her the victory in two hours and 11 minutes.View image in fullscreenMadison Keys sees her French Open semi-final hopes slip away.Photograph: Mohammed Badra/EPA“Maddie was playing well She’s hitting the ball so fast and so low so I was just trying to fight for each point,” said Gauff, the runner-up here in 2022 and the youngest woman to claim 25 main-draw wins at Roland Garros since Martina Hingis (1995-2000). “I knew I had to be able to run and as soon as the ball came short punish her for it.

The lawsuit argued that this amounted to sexual misconduct, and it claimed university officials were aware of this behavior, yet failed to stop it.Bob Knight: a life in picturesRead moreThe players said that they raised complaints, with some even requesting a different physician. However, the athletes alleged that Knight, who died in 2023, and head athletic trainer Tim Garl instructed players to continue seeing Bomba.Garl, who is named as a defendant in the lawsuit, was the head athletic trainer from 1981 until this year, whenIndianasaid it would not renew his contract. Garl’s attorneys, emphasizing that the trainer did not supervise Bomba, noted that rectal exams were a normal part of a physical.During his initial deposition a year ago, Bomba refused to answer 45 questions by invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.Last month, Indiana commissioned an investigation that found Bomba’s digital rectal exams were performed in a “clinically appropriate manner”, adding that there was “no evidence to suggest that Dr Bomba achieved sexual gratification”.However, Michelle Simpson Tuegel – representing the group of 10 players who are preparing to file suit – said two of her clients contradict that finding. One individual said Bomba “fondled his genitalia” during a physical.Some medical experts indicated that it was uncommon for a physician to perform a rectal exam without any concerning history or symptoms. These procedures are generally used to screen for prostate and other cancers. In the 1990s, the American Cancer Society recommended them for men who were 50 and older.An Indiana University spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing pending litigation.Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballIndianaCollege sportsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

But across music, television and observations on British daily life, something more familiar is trending onTikTok– a new generation of nostalgia.Music and TV from the 2000s are being rediscovered by gen X and ageing millennials, as well as being discovered for the first time by gen Z. Use of the #noughties nostalgia hashtag is up 36% on last year across entertainment content – while the era is also enjoying a revival in fashion.Sex and the City, which initially ran from 1999 to 2004, has been the subject of 108,000 videos on the site, with a doubling in videos over the past year. Gossip Girl, which ran from 2007 to 2012, has been the subject of 1.2m videos. Gilmore Girls, which ran from 2000 to 2007, has 1m associated videos. Vampire Diaries, which aired for eight years until 2017, is one of the most discussed, with 2m videos so far.There has also been a revival in attention for the UK show Skins, a drama about a group of teenagers from Bristol, which first aired on E4 in 2007. It has 1.6m posts globally to date.“We’re seeing a really big fondness for 90s and noughties across all key content categories,” said Lily Hall, a programs and insights manager at TikTok UK, Ireland and Nordics. “It obviously remains massive in fashion and beauty, and we’re continuously seeing older music, TV shows and films resurface as users are finding that comfort and escapism in the past.“Older series are currently amongst the most popular on the platform. You’ve got this new generation rediscovering older TV shows, and an older generation resharing their old favourites.”TikTok’s penchant for “Britcore” content has crossed over with the demand for 2000s nostalgia, with creators sharing videos on itsfashion and lifestyle,childhood toysand stores such as Toys R Us, anddiscontinued snackslike pink and white mice sweets and Cadbury’s Animal Crackers.Crime drama has also been having a bigger impact, with a 70% increase in associated videos over the past 12 months.The runaway success ofAdolescenceled to content examining how it was made in one shot. There have been 76,000 videos created with the programme’s hashtag. Other creators have been rediscovering the likes of Code of Silence and Kin.In music, the wave of nostalgia has included the rediscovery of tracks such asHeadlock by Imogen Heap, released in 2005, andPrice Tag by Jessie J, released in 2011.But the most surprising throwback success is a song that was recorded 64 years ago and was only deemed good enough at the time to make a B side. Yet Pretty Little Baby, by Connie Francis, has been adopted by a new generation and made waves on the platform. Such has been the impact that Francis, 87, has joined TikTok herself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Microsoft’s latest Surface Laptop is smaller and cheaper, managing to condense most of what is great about its larger siblings into a more compact frame without compromising too much on power.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Surface Laptop 13in joins the current seventh-generation Laptop 13.8in and 15in that were launched in the summer last year. It sits at the bottom of the premium pile in price, costing from £899 (€1,099/$900/A$1,699), but above the Laptop Go 3, which is likely to be phased out.The new 13in model looks like a cross between theLaptop Goand its bigger siblings. It has a similar but smaller glossy LCD touchscreen, which isn’t quite as bright or crisp and has a slower 60Hz refresh rate, but still looks good for the size. The smooth aluminium deck holds a full-size keyboard that offers a quality typing experience few competitors manage.View image in fullscreenThe power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe generous trackpad is smooth and precise but of the older, hinged variety, instead of the better haptic models fitted to the larger Surface Laptop models and other premium competitors. It still works fine but is harder to click higher up on the pad.The speakers in the deck are great for the size and the 1080p webcam above the screen is solid, even if it lacks Microsoft’sWindowsHello facial recognition for logging into the machine.SpecificationsScreen:13in LCD 1920 x 1280 (178 PPI)Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus (8 core)RAM:16GBStorage:256 or 512GBOperating system:Windows 11HomeCamera:1080P front-facingConnectivity:wifi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, USB-A, 2xUSB-C (3.2), headphonesDimensions:285.7 x 214.1 x 15.6mmWeight:1.2kgSnapdragon X PlusView image in fullscreenThe laptop takes about two hours to fully charge using a 60W or greater power adaptor (not included), hitting 50% in 36 minutes.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Laptop 13in has Qualcomm’s mid-rangeSnapdragon X PlusArm chip with eight cores (versus 10 on the larger models). It won’t win any raw performance awards but it is roughly on a par with its Intel competition and plenty fast enough for a laptop of this size. It stays quiet unless really pushed and feels snappy in operation while managing to be efficient on battery for general use. It lasts a very good 14 hours of work using plenty of browser tabs, multiple chat apps, text editors and note-taking apps. That is almost twice as long as previousIntel-based Surface Laptopsand much more on a par withApple’s class-leading MacBook Air.Using it for more demanding tasks, such as large photo editing or other creative applications, cuts the battery life roughly in half for a still solid seven hours.The Surface has two USB-C (3.2) ports and a USB-A port, which is reasonably good for a machine of this size. But it lacks the more modern USB4/Thunderbolt and ditches Microsoft’s proprietary Surface Connect port, relying instead on USB-C for charging, which is no bad thing unless you already own a Surface Dock or similar accessory.Windows 11 on ArmView image in fullscreenRecall allows you to go back in time to see what you were looking at in various apps using a timeline or search.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Surface runs Windows 11, which generally works well without any unnecessary trials and bits of software that frequently plague rivals. But Windows on Arm chips, such as the Surface’s Snapdragon models, still has a few compatibility problems not shared by the version running on the standard x86 chips from Intel or AMD.Apps that aren’t written for Arm systems have to be run through an emulation system, which works in the background but makes them much slower. Lighter-weight x86 apps, such as the note-taker Evernote, work OK but are noticeably slower than on Arm-native rivals.The majority of popular apps now have Arm versions, which fly along. That includes Google Drive, whichuntil recentlywas incompatible with Windows on Arm. But there are enough apps with issues, particularly in the creative industries, that you should check for problems before buying. Gaming is also tricky, as most big games including Fortnite are not compatible with Arm chips.View image in fullscreenCopilot in the Edge browser allows you to ask questions about the site you’re currently looking at instead of heading to a Google search.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe laptop is aCopilot+PCand includes Microsoft’s various AI tools. The much-delayedRecall featurerecords snapshots of what you’re doing on the machine so you can use it like a time machine to see what was on screen at any particular moment. You can search Recall using natural language and interact with the text, images or data it finds, such as opening a site you were browsing a couple of days ago.It is an opt-in feature, the screenshots are stored locally on your device secured by your fingerprint, and you can block some apps from being captured, such as a password manager, but it could still be a privacy risk too far for some.The rest of the AI tools are similar to those onprevious Surfaces, including a Cocreator system in Paint that can turn crude sketches into art. The most powerful tool is Copilot, which is integrated across multiple Microsoft apps, including Word and other members of the Office suite if you have a subscription. Generally it works as a cross between a search tool and an AI chatbot, and makes short work of turning data into tables, jazzing up your copy or identifying things from images, though you have to use Microsoft’s Edge browser for it to be able to see what you’re looking at on your screen.View image in fullscreenClick to Do is a new fast way of interacting with images, objects and text on your screen.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianMicrosoft’s new “Click to Do” feature allows you to hold the Windows button and click on something on your screen to perform actions with it, such as remove an image’s background with Paint or rewrite the text with AI. It is fairly basic at the moment, with more features to be added later this year, but it works as a much quicker and accessible way of performing AI tasks with things on a PC.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe smooth aluminium lid looks and feels premium, particularly in its violet colour option.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe laptop is generally repairable, with areplaceable SSD, spare parts,self-repairandservice guidesavailable. The machine contains recycled cobalt and rare earth metals. Microsoft operatestrade-in and recycling schemesand publishesout-of-warranty repair costsandproduct environmental impact reports.PriceThe Microsoft Surface Laptop 13in costs from£899(€1,099/$899.99/A$1,699) and ships on 10 June.For comparison, the Surface Laptop 13.8in costs from£944, the Surface Pro 12in costs£799, theSurface Pro 13incosts£1,029and the13in MacBook Air M4costs£999.VerdictThe Surface Laptop 13in is a smaller, cut-down version of Microsoft’s excellent Windows 11 laptop.The general feel of the machine is very similar to its larger siblings thanks to premium materials, a great keyboard and clutter-free Windows 11 experience. The 13in touchscreen is decent, if not quite as good as other models, and the older-technology trackpad still works well. Microsoft’s AI tools are slowly improving, though they are still not a reason to buy a machine.The lack of USB4/Thunderbolt and face recognition can be overlooked for a cheaper price, as can the lower-power chip. It proved more than fast enough for general productivity, and helps provide long battery life that could see out two full work days between charges. The Arm chip brings with it some potential app compatibility problems that are worth checking out before buying.Overall, the small Surface Laptop is a lovely machine. But at £900 or equivalent it’s not terribly cheap, with its larger and better sibling often available for similar money, so it’s worth shopping around.Pros:good keyboard, decent trackpad, good speakers, USB-A and USB-C, decent screen, fingerprint reader, long battery life, solid performance, clutter-free Windows 11 with AI features.Cons:app and game compatibility issues with Arm chip, screen only 60Hz and less crisp than larger siblings, no face recognition, no USB4, no haptic touchpad, a little expensive.View image in fullscreenSleek design and premium materials help elevate the Surface Laptop from the pack.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsMicrosoft SurfaceMicrosoftLaptopsComputingWindows 11WindowsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In its wisdom, Nintendo has decided not to send review units out until the day before release, so as you read this I will be standing impatiently by the door like a dog anxiously awaiting its owner.I have played the console, though, for a whole day at Nintendo’s offices, so I can give you some first impressions. Hardware-wise, it is the upgrade of my dreams: sturdier JoyCons, a beautiful screen, the graphical muscle to make games look as good as I want them to in 2025 (though still not comparable to the high-end PlayStation 5 Pro or a modern gaming PC). I like the understated pops of colour on the controllers, the refined menu with its soothing chimes and blips. Game sharing, online functionality and other basic stuff is frictionless now. I love that Nintendo Switch Online is so reasonably priced, at£18 a year, as opposed to about the same per month for comparable gaming services, and it gives me access to a treasure trove of Nintendo games from decades past.But here’s the key word in that paragraph: it’s an upgrade. After eight years, an upgrade feels rather belated. I was hoping for something actually new, and aside from the fact that you can now use those controllers as mice by turning them sideways and moving them around on a desk or on your lap, there isn’t much new in the Switch 2. Absorbed in Mario Kart World, the main launch title, it was easy to forget I was even playing a new console. I do wonder –as I did in January– whether many less gaming-literate families who own a Switch will see a reason to upgrade, given the£400 asking price.View image in fullscreenBrilliant … Mario Kart World.Photograph: NintendoSpeaking ofMario KartWorld, though: it’s brilliant. Totally splendid. It will deservedly sell squillions. Alongside the classic competitive grand prix and time trial races, the headline feature is an open, driveable world that you can explore all you like, as any character, picking up characters and costumes and collectibles, and getting into elimination-style races that span the full continent. All the courses are part of one huge map, and they flow right into one another.Your kart transforms helpfully into a boat when you hit water, and I found an island with a really tricky challenge where I had to ride seaplanes up towards a skyscraper in the city, driving over their wings from one to the other. Anyone could lose hours driving aimlessly around the colourful collection of mountains, jungles and winding motorways here. There’s even a space-station themed course that cleverly echoes the original Donkey Kong arcade game, delivering a nostalgia hit as delightful as Super Mario Odyssey’s climactic New Donk City festival.Pushing Buttons correspondent Keith Stuart alsohad a great timewith another launch game, Konami’s Survival Kids, which is a bit like Overcooked except all the players are working together to survive on a desert island. (Be reassured, if you generally find survival games hard work: it’s very much fun over peril.)However: I would steer clear of theNintendoSwitch Welcome Tour, an almost belligerently un-fun interactive tour of the console’s new features … that costs £7.99. Your tiny avatar walks around a gigantic recreation of a Switch 2 console, looking for invisible plaques that point out its different components. There are displays with uninteresting technical information about, say, the quality of the console’s HD rumble. One of the interactive museum displays shows a ball bounding across the screen and asks you to guess how many frames per second it is travelling at. As someone who aggressively does not care about fine technical detail, I was terrible at this. It’s like being on the least interesting school trip of your life.And it felt felt remarkably un-Nintendo, so dry and devoid of personality that it made me a little worried.Nintendo Labo, by contrast, was a super-fun and accessible way of showing off the original Switch’s technical features. I had assumed that Welcome Tour would be made by the same team, but evidently not.I couldn’t wait to get back to Mario Kart World, which, once again, is fantastic. I’m excited to spend the rest of the week playing it for a proper review. And if you’ve pre-ordered a Switch 2, you’ll have it in your hands in the next 24 hours. For those holding off: we’ll have plenty more Switch 2 info and opinions in the next few weeks to help you make a decision.What to playArms akimbo … to a T is funny and weird.Illustration: Annapurna interactive/SteamLast week I played throughto a T, the beautifully strange, unexpectedly thoughtful new game from Katamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi. It is about a young teenager who is forever stuck in a T-pose, arms akimbo. As you might imagine, this makes life rather difficult for them, and they must rely on their fluffy little dog to help them through life. It’s a kid-friendly game about accepting who you are – I played it with my sons – but it is also extremely funny and weird, and features a song about a giraffe who loves to make sandwiches. I love a game where you don’t know what to expect, and I bet that if I asked every single reader of this newsletter to guess how it ends, not one of you would be anywhere close.Available on:PS5, Xbox, PCEstimated playtime:five hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenTake chances … Remy Siu (left) and Nhi Do accept the Peabody award for 1000xRESIST.Photograph: Charley Gallay/Getty images1000xRESIST, last year’s critical darling sci-fi game about the immigrant experience and the cost of political resistance,won a Peabody awardthis week. From the creators’ acceptance speech: “I want to say to the games industry, resource those on the margins and seek difference. Take chances again and again. This art form is barely unearthed. It’s too early to define it. Fund the indescribable.”Keith Stuart wrote about thelargely lost ageofmidnight launch parties– for the Switch 2 launch, only Smyths Toys is hosting midnight releases.

We will be using our platforms to directly address the French public tomorrow,” a spokesperson for Pornhub said on Tuesday.By showing the message rather than Pornhub’s vast library of adult content, Aylo “is communicating directly with the French people to tell them how dangerous, how potentially privacy-infringing, and how ineffective the French law is”, Solomon Friedman of Aylo’s owner, Ethical Capital Partners, told reporters in a video call on Tuesday.France has this year gradually introduced requirements for all adult websites to have users confirm their age with details like a credit card or ID document.In a bid to preserve privacy, operators must offer a third-party “double-blind” option that would keep the platforms themselves from seeing users’ identifying information.But Aylo says this is an ineffective mechanism that puts people’s data at risk from bad actors, hacks or leaks.They say countries should target developers of operating systems like Microsoft’s Windows, Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android, rather than porn platforms.“Aylo is extremely pro the concept of age verification,” executive Alex Kekesi told reporters in a video call.But requiring individual platforms to confirm visitors’ ages “poses a very serious risk … with respect to your privacy rights”, she added.ECP’s Friedman said: “Google, Apple and Microsoft all have the capability built into their operating system to verify the age of the user at the operating system or device level.”Their ability “to supply an age signal to any site or app … can actually provide a solution” for controlling access to adult content without requiring users to share sensitive data with multiple websites, he argued.“I understand that those three entities are large and they’re powerful, but that is not an excuse for France to do what they have done.”Aylo’s message to would-be porn viewers will be topped with the image of Liberty Leading the People from Eugene Delacroix’s renowned bare-breasted painting of the allegorical figure.Culture minister Aurore Berge wrote on X that it was “so much the better” if Pornhub and other Aylo sites cut off access for French users rather than “conforming to our legal framework”.“There will be less violent, degrading and humiliating content accessible to minors in France,” she added.“If Aylo would rather leave France than apply our laws, they are free to do so,” Clara Chappaz, France’s junior minister for artificial intelligence and digital technology, wrote on X.Arcom has said that 2.3 million minors access porn websites every month even though legally they should be blocked from them.Adult content platforms have come under fire elsewhere in the European Union. EU regulators said last month that several sites, including Pornhub, would be investigated for failing to comply with rules to protect children.Explore more on these topicsFranceInternetEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I urge them to defend their principlesGus Casely-Hayford is director of London’s V&A EastWed 4 Jun 2025 10.32 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 13.00 EDTShareIn one of his recent Truth Social posts, Donald Trumpappeared to fireKim Sajet – the fearless and utterly brilliant director of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC. The president used his social media platform to claim that Sajet’s support for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) made her unsuitable for her role. “Upon the request and recommendation of many people, I am hereby terminating the employment of Kim Sajet as Director of the National Portrait Gallery”, Trump wrote. “She is a highly partisan person, and a strong supporter of DEI, which is totally inappropriate for her position. Her replacement will be named shortly.”Where to start? By now, we all know the arts has become the terrain for a brutal proxy battle for hearts and minds. A culture war 2.0, where not just reputations are at stake, but institutions, whole sectors and ways of thinking. But I am hoping that even Trump’s support base have begun to grow a little bored with these attacks on figures and institutions in the cultural sector. The culture war has moved beyond farce into the deeply tragic.I am sure even many of the president’s most loyal supporters know deep down that the Smithsonian (a vast complex of 21 museums) is a genuine force for good, an institution that represents so much of the US at its very best. And like the Kennedy Center, the cultural institution that Trumptook control ofearlier this year, or the universitieshis administration has attacked, the Smithsonian is a fish in a barrel: easy to bully, its financial destiny in significant part tied to public funding, with limited scope to defend itself. This contrived political theatre damages critical institutions, threatens the careers of talented, dedicated people, and its repercussions will be deep and long-lasting.Good museums are not sleepy institutions trapped in heritage-aspic. Across its 178-year history, the Smithsonian has consistently evolved to reflect ambient change and address public need. Like many other national museums around the world, these changes, particularly in recent years, have been driven by an aspiration to engage and enfranchise, to broaden audiences and to catalyse national conversations. I would have thought that seeking to give value back to a greater number of the population is uncontroversial. Institutions this important, mostly sponsored by the public, must simply, continually, work to be ever more universal, inclusive and open. Left or right, that has value. In times like these, when we are, as citizens of western democracies, so riven and divided, the arts have a job to do of being a space for inclusive debate.But the truth is that DEI isn’t some new-fangled indulgence. That drive to be inclusive is what good museums were created to deliver. Twenty-five years ago, I began my career at the British Museum. I still remember reading its founding purpose for the first time. The British Museum was created for “all studious and curious persons”. I remember thinking that the word that does the really hard work in that statement is “all”. The British Museum was created in the mid-18th century around an inclusive imperative, around the idea that we might all hope to find ourselves reflected in its spaces and concerns.Its founders must have recognised the powerful need for a national museum: it was created at a time when Britain was going through a period of existential anxiety, when Scots were rebelling; the country needed a unifying narrative. I am sure the British Museum’s founders knew exactly what they were doing when they committed the institution to that beautifully enfranchising ambition of being for us all. And yes, I know museums have so often failed miserably to live up to these inclusive objectives, but we must never stop trying, nor relinquish the basis on which the public can hold us to account.Universities and museums are vital for healthy societies, and their independence, their bravery, their sometimes maddening honesty, underpins so much that is important. We undermine that at our peril. I spent a number of treasured years as a Smithsonian museum director and fell for its ethos and its dedicated people. It was founded on an ambition to propagate “the increase and diffusion of knowledge”. It was created to enable transformational change through sharing and empowering US citizens with knowledge, with truth. I cannot think of a time when this has been more important.It is unclear whether Trump has the authority to fire Sajet. What is clear is that his move is designed to demoralise her and all my former Smithsonian colleagues. That’s why, directing a different museum now, across the Atlantic, I feel moved to write. We in the cultural sector everywhere need to stand up and be counted, we need to celebrate Kim Sajet, we need to not retreat from diversity here in Britain. To my former colleagues,I say that speaking the truth and having the courage to do so when it is difficult does not make you unsuitable for your roles in a demographically complex democracy; it is probably the most important aspect of what we are called upon to do. It is easy writing the diversity action plan, but having the moral courage to stand up for those principles when they are needed – that is heroic.Gus Casely-Hayford is a curator, cultural historian, broadcaster and lecturer who is currently the director ofV&A EastExplore more on these topicsMuseumsOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

And his temper tantrums won’t stop thatSteven GreenhouseA word of advice to Trump: dozens of judges keep ruling against you because you’ve flouted the law more than any previous presidentWed 4 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 12.40 EDTShareIt’s hard to keep track of all the temper tantrums that Donald Trump has had because he’s so ticked off that one judge after another has ruled against his flood of illegal actions. In seeking to put their fingers in the dike to stop the US president’s lawlessness, federal judges have issued a startling high number of rulings,more than 185, to block or temporarily pause moves by the Trump administration.Livid about all this, White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has railed against “judicial activism”, while Trump adviser Stephen Miller carps about a “judicial coup”. As for Trump, the grievance-is-me president has gone into full conniption-mode, moaning about anti-Trump rulings and denouncing “USA-hating judges”. On Truth Social, he said: “How is it possible for [judges] to have potentially done such damage to the United States of America? Is itpurely a hatred of ‘TRUMP’? What other reason could it be?”Trump is acting like the 10-year-old bully who pummeled a dozen classmates in the schoolyard, but when his teacher called him out for his thuggishness, he burst into tears and screamed: “This is so unfair! Why are you picking on me?”A word of advice to Trump: you should realize that dozens of judges keep ruling against you because you have flouted the law more than any previous president and because you and your flunkies keep misinterpreting and stretching the nation’s laws far beyond their meaning.Like many authoritarian rulers, he hates having judges weigh whether his actions have violated the lawTake Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs, when he announced steep, across-the-board tariffs against 57 countries. On that day, Trump became the first president to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to impose tariffs. To Trump’s dismay, three judges on the US court of international tradeunanimously ruledthat he had overstepped his authority and gone far beyond what that 1977 law allows presidents to do. The trade court wrote that the constitution gives Congress, not the president, power over tariff policy and that the 1977 law didn’t give Trump “unbounded” authority to impose tariffs.After that 28 May ruling, Trump’s latest tantrum began.Then, there’s his chest-thumping, cold-hearted rush to expel as many immigrants as possible. To accomplish that, Trump became the first president to invoke the 227-year-old Alien Enemies Act in peacetime. twisting that law’s language to declare that several dozen gang members from Venezuela constitute a war-like invasion force, similar to an enemy army, who could therefore be deported without due process. But severalsane, sober judgestold Trump that he is full of it. There’s no war-like invasion here.And then there’s Trump’s effort to stomp on several prestigious law firms that have done things or hired people he doesn’t like. Trump became the first president to essentially put a gun to various law firms’ heads to try to make them submit to him. He sought to undermine those firms’ business with astonishingly vengeful executive orders that not only said that their lawyers couldn’t enter federal buildings and would lose their security clearances, but that their corporate clients might lose their federal contracts. And then there was the unspoken threat that Trump would block corporate deals that those firms’ lawyers were working on. This is poisonous stuff, punishing law firms for doing what our legal system has long called on firms to do: represent clients, even unpopular ones (even ones Trump doesn’t like).Trump’s attacks on law firms are an attack on law itself | David Cole and Amrit SinghRead moreHere, Trump was engaging in a shakedown, in effect saying: “That’s a nice law firm you have. It’s a shame if something happens to it. (So you’d be smart to submit to my demands.)” Again,several judges told Trumphe’s full of it, that the law firms hadn’t done anything wrong to warrant such illegal shakedown efforts.There are cases galore in which judges found that Trump acted illegally. Judges have provisionally blocked his push to bar international students from attending Harvard and ordered the release of several immigrant graduate students his administration arrested. Judges have ruled against Trump’s dismantling of the Department of Education, his freezing up to $3tn in funding for the states and his firing thousands of federal civil servants.Hating to see judges rule against his boss, Stephen Miller absurdly asserted: “We are living under a judicial tyranny,” while Leavitt carped that judges have “usurp[ed] the authority of President Trump to stop him from carrying out the mandate that the American people gave him”. (What mandate? Trump didn’t even receive 50% of the vote, beating Kamala Harris by a mere 1.5 percentage points. Nor did Americans vote for Trump’s tariff chaos or his all-out war against universities.)What we’ve heard from Trump (and mouthpieces Leavitt and Miller) is dangerous stuff. Trump is essentially rejecting the idea of judicial review. Like many authoritarian rulers, he hates having judges weigh whether his actions have violated the law. Trump forgets that under the constitution, judges (not the president) are the umpires who rule whether the president or Congress is following or flouting the law. As Ty Cobb, a former lawyer for Trump,said: “Trump’s attack on the judges is an attempt to undo the separation of powers. It’s an attempt to take what is three coequal branches and make it one dominant branch.”Trump’s attacks against the judiciary are dangerous in another way – they have literally endangered judges’ safety. In the five months before 1 March, 80 judges received threats, but after Trump’s tirades against judges began to crescendo in February, the number of threats soared: more than160 judges received threatsin the six weeks after 1 March. On Memorial Day, Trump loosed another rant, calling judges who ruled against him “monsters who wantour country to go to hell”.Will Donald Trump defy the US supreme court? | Steven GreenhouseRead moreWith these diatribes, Trump is seeking to delegitimize the judiciary and turn the public against judges, just as his unrelenting attacks against the news media have helped cause many people to lose faith in the media, no matter that many news organizations are as accurate and fair-minded as ever (and far more truthful than Trump).Trump’s war against the judiciary has taken another form – his administrationhas evaded, skirted andignorednumerous judicial orders –stonewalling a judge’s requestfor information in an immigration case, failing to comply with the US supreme court’s call to “facilitate” thereturn of a wrongly deported immigrant, dragging its feet in restoring funding that had been illegally frozen.After the trade court’s ruling, Leavitt griped that judges issued more “injunctions in one full monthof office, in February, than Joe Biden had in three years”. Leavitt is blind to the obvious reason for this – Trump, in churning out more than 150 executive orders, a record number – has far too often violated the law and the constitution with abandon, while Biden was far more scrupulous in complying with the law.Trump and cronies should recognize that there’s a very simple way to get judges to stop overruling his actions. All Trump has to do is stop taking all these illegal, vindictive actions and stop issuing all these destructive, lawless executive orders. What’s more, considering that Trump once tweeted: “He who saves his Countrydoes not violate any Law,” he needs to stop acting like a modern-day king or Napoleon who is above the law.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationUS politicsUS supreme courtRepublicansLaw (US)Trump tariffscommentShareReuse this content"

We also have an equal duty to remember that Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims are also being targetedWed 4 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 14.05 EDTShareThis must stop. Two incidents of political violence, both targeting groups of Jewish people, are two incidents too many. Less than two weeks ago, a gunman shot and killed two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington DC, yelling “Free Palestine” as he was being detained. This week, a man used a “makeshift flamethrower” along with other incendiary devices toattacka Boulder, Colorado, rally organized byRun for Their Lives, a group which organizes events “calling for the immediate release of the hostages held by Hamas”. Eight people wereinjuredin this latest assault, at least two of them seriously.These horrific acts will no doubt increase the anxiety many Jewish people have about increasing – and increasingly violent – antisemitism in the US. Understandably so. Antisemitism must not be given any oxygen to breathe. One can oppose Israel’s 600-plus day war, relentlessly pounding innocent people in Gaza, while vigorously opposing all forms of antisemitism. In fact, one must oppose both. Such is our duty to each other in a civilized world.And as we have a duty to call out antisemitism when we see it, we also have an equal duty to remember that Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims have also been subjected to extreme forms of violence and bigotry in the US since the beginning of this terrible war. And while we are certain to hear much about today’s rising antisemitism in the coming days, as we should, we must also make sure to acknowledge the rising threats against Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims.Consider what happened to Wadea al-Fayoume, a six-year-old Palestinian American boy. Wadea was murdered in October 2023 by his landlord, who stabbed the young boy 26 times in his home in Plainfield Township, Illinois. The landlord also attacked the boy’s mother, Hanan Shaheen,stabbingher over a dozen times whiletellingher “you, as a Muslim, must die.” Joseph Czuba, 73, the landlord, was foundguiltyof murder, attempted murder, and hate crime charges last month and sentenced to 53 years in prison.Or there are the three Palestinian friends, all college students, who were out for a stroll in Vermont during the Thanksgiving long weekend in 2023. They weregunned downin what many are assuming is a hate crime. The three were speaking a mixture of Arabic and English and were sporting keffiyehs, and one of the three, Hisham Awartani, is now paralyzed from the neck down due to the shooting. The alleged assailant, Jason Eaton, is currentlyon trialfor the shooting.And there’s the time, in May 2024, when a woman attempted to drown a three-year old Palestinian girl in a swimming pool in an apartment complex in the Dallas-Fort Worth suburb of Euless. The suspect, Elizabeth Wolf, was arrested after the attack and, in September 2024, a grand juryindictedWolf on attempted capital murder and bodily injury to a child under and intentionally causing bodily injury to a child. The grand jury also included a hate crime enhancement in the indictment.Or what about the evening when Zacharia Doar and three of his friends wereattackedwhile they were in their truck, which had a keffiyeh hanging off its side. They were returning from a rally for Palestine in Austin, Texas, in February 2024. Their alleged attacker, Bert James Baker, was yelling racial slurs at them when he reportedly pulled Doar out of the truck and stabbed the 23-year-old Palestinian American in the back. Austin police labeled the attack a hate crime, though the grand jury did not include a hate crime finding in theirindictmentof Baker for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.We should recall that more than 30 protestors for Palestinian rights have filed a lawsuit against campus officials at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and law enforcement agencies, alleging that their civil rights had been violated during protests on campus. Last year, amobof at least a 100 masked young men descended on an encampment for Palestine that had been erected on campus. The mob attacked the protest for hours while law enforcement watched from the sidelines. As the New York Timesdescribedit, “counterprotesters swarmed individuals – sometimes a group descended on a single person. They could be seen punching, kicking and attacking people with makeshift weapons, including sticks, traffic cones and wooden boards.” Dozens of people were injured and taken to the hospital for treatment,accordingto the Los Angeles Times.These are just a few of the stories of violence and abuse. There are, unfortunately, plenty more, such as the Illinois woman who allegedlyattackeda man and his pregnant wife at a Panera Bread because the man was wearing a shirt that said “Palestine.” The woman waschargedwith two counts of a hate crime and one count of misdemeanor disorderly conduct. Or there’s the bizarre case of the Jewish man in Miami Beach who allegedly shot at two men he believed to be Palestinians but who were in fact Jewish Israeli tourists. While in custody, the shootertoldthe police “he saw two Palestinians and shot and killed both,” according to arrest documents. Stranger still, one of the men who was shotreportedlyposted on social media that he and his father “survived an attempted murder motivated by antisemitism,” and then ended his message writing “death to Arabs.”The organizations which track antisemitism and Islamophobia have each recorded record highincidentsandcomplaintsin the past year, as the violence of this war blows back our shores. None of this should be happening, and it’s clear that our first line of defense, and our responsibility as Americans, is to stop this war immediately, “before this violence grows and spreads further, consuming even more innocent lives in its monstrous path.” Iwrotethose words just over a week ago after the murder of embassy staffers in Washington DC. In a grim turn of events, they are even more true today.Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionUS politicsIsrael-Gaza warBoulder, Colorado attackcommentShareReuse this content"

The prime minister who failed faster than any previous holder of the office has much to say about her dismal record, but nothing insightful. She cuts a pitiful spectacle padding out the schedule at rightwing conferences, chasing attention and relevance with an addict’s fervour.Last week, Truss was at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Budapest,sharing the big lesson she learnedin government. It was that British institutions have been captured by a leftist doctrine and that they “hate western civilisation”. She couldn’t possibly counter this threat from No 10 because supposedly the real power was wielded by a well-financed “globalist network”, operating through such engines of anti-democratic subterfuge as the International Monetary Fund and the World Health Organization.Truss believes these nefarious forcesauthored her downfall. They taught her that gradual reform is impossible. Only a “Trump-style revolution” will do. This is her routine spiel. Indeed, it was the theme of her paranoid, self-pitying memoir-cum-manifesto, Ten Years to Save the West, published last year. Her disquisitions on the topic go unreported in her home country. She made more headlines last week from a two-month-old cameo appearance in apromotional video for a whiskey brandlaunched by a bare-knuckle fighter with a conviction for violent assault. (How that endorsement advances the restoration of western civilisation was unclear.) But a thorough summary of the CPAC speech was dutifully published by Tass, Russia’s main state news agency. Their report led with the claim that“globalists are trying to control the political process across Europe”.It is standard practice for Russian news channels to weave selective quotes from western politicians into tendentious propaganda, except there is no need to take Truss’s words out of context. She narrates the west’s slide into godless decadence without an edit. She provides the frothy conspiracy theories that Kremlin-friendly bots amplify on social media, and hallmarks them with the authority of a former prime minister.A British audience knows the caveats to that status: Truss was ousted within 50 days;a lettuce had more staying power. But the title stands. She really did rise to the top, and not through some freak system malfunction. She played and won the Westminster game by its rules. She had multiple ministerial briefs under three prime ministers. She persuaded a clear majority of members of Britain’s venerable establishment party to make her their leader.Colleagues who suspected (or knew from experience) that Truss was unhinged stayed silent or endorsed her candidacy once her momentum looked unstoppable. Client journalists who had benefited from her notorious indiscretion, and looked forward to ever greater intimacy with power, colluded in the fiction of her fitness to govern.Even now, when the former prime minister’s name is a byword for economic incompetence,Conservativesare euphemistic in contrition. When invited to apologise on behalf of her party for the disastrous mini-budget of September 2022, Kemi Badenoch has said only that she wants to “draw a line” under the episode.The obstacle is not a residue of loyalty but a continuity of belief. The dogmatic engine of Trussonomics – that tax cuts always pay for themselves by stimulating enterprise to generate growth – is still an axiom of mainstream Conservatism. So is Trussite suspicion of the public sector as a redoubt of bureaucratic socialism.Badenoch, like Truss, backs a Maga-style revolution to rip chunks out of the government apparatus. She has spoken enthusiastically about Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, adding that Doge methods are not “radical enough” for the bloated British state.The fact that Musk’s purgative rampage through Washington has failed to produce the advertised cost savings doesn’t deter imitators. Nigel Farage has announced the creation of amercenary Doge “unit”to hunt down waste in the councils that Reform UK won in last month’s local elections.This exercise serves a double function. First, Farage will scapegoat any local officials whose duties can be branded under the rubric of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Second, he will overstate the expense of such schemes, generating improbable nationwide savings to justify tax cuts in a Reform manifesto. Trussonomics will be rehabilitated and rearmed with imported US culture war rhetoric.Farage was once a fan of Truss’s economic policy. He praised her fiscal farrago as “the best Conservative budget since 1986”. The year harked back to the heyday of Thatcherism. These days Farage has to be careful about fetishising the Iron Lady. His party’s electoral base lives inLabour’s former heartlands, so he is a convert to the cause of industrial nationalisation. He now shakes his magic money tree to the left as well as the right.The Tories lack such ideological elasticity. In any case, Badenoch doesn’t seem interested in economics. She is more animated by the crusade for free speech. This, like the demonisation of DEI, is a fixation borrowed from the US right. When JD Vance declared that Europeandemocracy was more imperilled by censorious liberalsthan by Russian military aggression, Badenoch admired the US vice-president’s deployment of “truth bombs”. Here, too, she is on the same page as Truss, who told last week’s CPAC audience that free-thinking dissidents from Keir Starmer’s Britain find refuge in Viktor Orbán’s Hungary. (Orbán is Europe’s foremost admirer of Vladimir Putin. He has suffocated independent media and political opposition.)It is hard to know how much of this derangement is conviction and how much is cupidity. There is money to be earned bad-mouthing Britain on the ultra-nationalist lecture circuit, but it is also easy to self-radicalise in that milieu.It is also hard to know how receptive a UK audience is to US conservative manias. Much of the UK right dwells in a US-coded online hallucination of Britain where criminal hordes of migrants have turned city centres into no-go areas and liberal thought police harass law-abiding white Christians.The danger is not that millions of voters will recognise the bleak dystopia as a factual representation of their country, but that it resonates as an allegory of national decline. It is not the complaint that Britain is in bad shape – dilapidation and economic strife are self-evident – but the cultivation of despair by projecting hard problems through a facile, conspiratorial lens. It is the insinuation that existing democratic institutions are not merely failing to make life better but maliciously orchestrating misery.This is the nihilistic cynicism that vaporises trust, corrodes civic culture and makes simple, authoritarian solutions attractive. It is music to Vladimir Putin’s ears and grist to his digital disinformation mills.Perhaps we should be grateful to Liz Truss for playing the archetype of unwitting accomplice to tyranny – the “useful idiot” of cold war parlance – so ineptly. She contaminates any cause she touches.That is why the British right shuns her. But social ostracism isn’t ideological repudiation. The current Tory and Reform leaders are embarrassed by association with Truss, not because they despise what she says butbecause she looks ridiculous. Her offence was not the grift, but its exposure in ways that might discredit more skilful practitioners. She is not too extreme, only artless in applying the camouflage. She is the crumpled, discarded packaging from a product that, rewrapped, could be delivered once again to Downing Street.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistOne year of Labour, with Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr and moreOn 9 July, join Pippa Crerar, Raf Behr, Frances O’Grady and Salma Shah as they look back at one year of the Labour government and plans for the next four yearsExplore more on these topicsLiz TrussOpinionCPACKemi BadenochNigel FarageUS politicsReform UKConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

The chancellor needs to raise revenues, fastWed 4 Jun 2025 11.36 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 13.03 EDTShareSir Keir Starmer is pledgingto make Britain “battle-ready”by spending billions of pounds on arms factories, drones and submarines. Rachel Reeves says shewill invest £15bnin trams, buses and trains for towns and cities outside London. The announcements by the prime minister and chancellor followed last month’spartial U-turnon the means testing of pensioners’ winter fuel allowance. Anyone could be forgiven for thinking the tough times were over and that money was now no object.Nothing could be further from the truth. The spending review Reeves will deliver next week comes at a time when growth is weak and borrowing high. The brutal reality is that if more is to be spent on defence and the NHS, if the police are to be handed extra resources to tackle crime, and if pledges to hit housebuilding and net zero targets are to be fulfilled, something has to give. And that something will be higher taxes in the budget. It is just a matter of which taxes and who pays them.Reeves could simply borrow more money to fund increases in spending. That’s precisely what happened during the global financial crisis of 2008-09 and during the pandemic. It is what would happen again in the event that the new cold war turned into a real shooting match. When things are really bad, governments abandon all thoughts of financial probity, spend whatever it takes and think about the consequences later.Short of a full-blown crisis, there is no way Reeves is going to throw caution to the wind. Her room for manoeuvre is limited by her self-imposedfiscal rules– that over time national debt should be falling as a share of national income, and that day-to-day spending should be covered by tax receipts. The first of these affects the level of capital spending and was tweaked in last autumn’s budget to make possible the welcome increases in spending on transport infrastructure for less well-off parts of the country. Even so, the debt rule still means there are constraints on capital spending, and the more that is invested in military hardware, the less will be available for everything else.In the short term, it is the second rule that makes life difficult for Reeves. Unsurprisingly, given the neglect of the public realm in the 14 years of Conservative rule, there are powerful arguments for higher day-to-day spending, but the chancellor has insisted these must be covered by tax receipts. This rule – “iron-clad” according to Reeves – is policed by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which provides outside scrutiny of the state of the public finances. If the OBR says the rule is going to be broken, Reeves can only avoid raising taxes if she is prepared to sayit is not so “iron-clad”after all.There is a case for doing this. The OBR is far from infallible and its assessment is based on judgment calls on what will happen to the economy over the coming years. Cutting spending or raising taxes on the basis of views that might change within a matter of months is not sensible policymaking. At the very least, there should be less frequent OBR assessments – a changerecently recommendedby the International Monetary Fund.Rachel Reeves must think big to fund Labour’s ‘battle-ready’ Britain. Tweaks and tinkering won’t do | Polly ToynbeeRead moreBritain currently has a system where the level of public spending is determined by what the Treasury and the OBR says the country can afford, rather than a system where it is determined by what the country actually needs. Those needs are many and will cost plenty to put right.The prisons are full, the roads are potholed, the police say the fight against crime is being hampered by a lack of cash.There is no longer a peace dividend to fund higher welfare spending. Voters think the NHS needs extra resources, and after the furore over the winter fuel allowance, it will be a brave government that floats the idea of scrappingthe triple lockguaranteeing that the state pension rises in line with either inflation, earnings or a minimum of 2.5%.Rapid growth would help but seems unlikely. A complete rethink of borrowing rules is not being considered. As a result, unless the state is going to shrink in size, the government has to be prepared to raise taxes. That’s not a popular message, to say the least, especially when taxes are on course toreach the highest shareof national income in more than 70 years.This is understandable. The recent cost of living crisis eroded living standards and made the public hostile to the idea of paying more tax. Voters think higher spending is a good idea – but only if somebody else foots the bill. This would make it a political no-no to raise VAT rates and income tax, even if that were not already ruled out by Labour’s election manifesto commitment.So Reeves needs to think creatively about ways to raise revenue. A fresh freeze on income tax allowances and thresholds is one possibility, although it would hit the pockets of working people, and almost certainly lead to a bigger opinion poll lead for Reform UK.But there are other options. Atax on financial transactionsis one. Limiting pension tax relief to the basic rate of income tax – assuggested by the tax expertRichard Murphy – is another. But no matter what Reeves chooses, she needs to start making the case now that you can’t get better public services on the cheap.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEconomicsOpinionRachel ReevesTaxTax and spendingLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

So household spending was worse.Then last week theprivate capital expenditure figuresrevealed a 0.1% fall in investment in buildings and engineering, compared with a 0.2% rise in the December 2024 quarter. So private investment was worse.On Tuesday,the balance of paymentsrevealed that trade in the first three months of this year was expected to “detract 0.1%pts from the March quarter” compared with adding 0.2%pts in December. So trade was worse.Just to top it off, on Tuesday the figuresfor government spending and investmentshowed that public demand fell in the March quarter and would also detract 0.1%pts from GDP growth compared with it adding 0.2%pts to GDP growth last December. So the impact of the public sector was worse.To be honest, once you take away households, private investment, trade and government spending, you really are not left with much.So it came to be.In theMarch quarter of this year, GDP growthwas just 0.2%, down from 0.6% in the December quarter. The only good news is the March quarter last year was pretty dire as well, so all up it meant annual growth remained steady at a still extremely weak 1.3%.If the graph does not display click hereThis weak growth meant that per capita GDP fell again – the ninth quarter out of the past 11.This is not a good state of affairs, and certainly does not accord with the views ofthe Reserve Bank back in Aprilwhen it looked at the first three months of this year and suggested that “the limited information available about activity in early 2025 suggested that the pick-up in GDP growth had been sustained”.Ahh well, at least they can say they were not wrong for long?Well no. In theminutes of the May board meetingreleased this week the RBA now suggested that “GDP growth had increased in the December quarter 2024 and year-ended growth looked to have picked up a little further in the March quarter”. Going from 1.3% growth in December to 1.3% growth in March is hardly “picked up”.The MayStatement on Monetary Policyalso predicted annual GDP growth in June of 1.8%. To get to that level, the economy would need to grow in April, May and June by 0.7% – the strongest quarter growth for three years. Here’s hoping …So what drove the growth that was there?Households were the biggest contributor to growth – although as in all things the context is key. Their contribution to the growth of the economy in the March quarter was about half what you would normally expect.If the graph does not display click hereAnd a big reason for the increase in consumption was a jump in spending on electricity, gas and other fuels – due to the ending of some of the state government energy rebates (which also had an impact on inflation). That is not the type of spending you want to see driving households.All up the level of household consumption is well down on what would have been expected before the pandemic. The Reserve Bank’s interest rate rises did their job – they snuffed out spending. Clearly more rate cuts are needed to undo that damage and it is quite extraordinary that the RBA is so sanguine about it all:If the graph does not display click hereskip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But for small business owners taking out an overdraft loan, things are even worse – the rate is 400 basis point higher:If the graph does not display click hereBut let us not be too negative. One very good piece of news is that household living standards are on the rise. After two years, finally household disposable income per capita is above the level it was in March 2020:If the graph does not display click hereOne reason for this was there was a very slight decline in the level of mortgage repayments, due to the rate cut in February. This cut actually helped increased living standards in the first three months of this year. But that was a very small repair, given since March 2022 mortgage repayments have contributed about 63% of the fall in living standards:If the graph does not display click hereThat’s a sizeable chunk and it reinforces the damage that is done when the RBA so badly misreads the economy as it has. These figures highlight that not only should the Reserve Bank have cut rates in April but having made that error it compounded it by not cutting rates by at least 50 basis points last month.So far this year the RBA has kept misreading the economic situation and erred on the side of caution. Let us hope these weak figures spur it to cut rates when it meets next month and not suggest it still needs more time to see what is going on.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsBusinessReserve Bank of AustraliaInterest ratescommentShareReuse this content"

The argument goes that the government is conspiring with malign developers todestroy irreplaceable habitatsas a first resort. This sounds alarming, if only it were true.The truth is that our current framework for protecting habitats has been in place for decades but has failed to prevent nature loss. This is because we approach conservation in the least effective way possible, with tens of thousands of individual site-by-site protections. Ecological science is clear that this is outdated. Modern conservation strategies recognise the necessity of interconnectivity and scale for supporting complex ecosystems.As well as failing nature, this system adds yet more costs and barriers to the new homes and infrastructure our country needs, because builders are distracted by cooking up well-meaning but ultimately piecemeal mitigation schemes with questionable impact, such as the nowinfamous HS2 bat tunnel, which is ridiculed by environmentalists and industrialists alike.Without more homes, wealth will continue to concentrate and homelessness will grow. Without better infrastructure, we cannot build more prosperous communities across the Midlands and north. And without getting smarter, habitat decline is inevitable. The status quo will see more young people robbed of the joy of nature, the security and socioeconomic mobility that previous generations enjoyed, and it will hinder our efforts to tackle the climate crisis. Something needs to change.The government has proposed a solution. The bill will establish a nature restoration fund, which will support a number of strategic nature restoration schemes across the country at a scale that is genuinely impactful.Natural England will produce a series of “environmental delivery plans”, underpinned by ecological science, explaining how it will deliver an “overall improvement in conservation status” for a given environmental feature. This test is set out in the legislation. Unlike now, performance will be regularly measured against what was promised and the approach in the plans must be amended if they are not delivering. This will mean results are easier to evaluate and scrutinise, as well as making enforcement simpler. Crucially these schemes will operate across council boundaries, because nature does. Instead of creating their own bespoke schemes, developers will financially contribute to much greater environmental outcomes nationally. This is what is meant by a “win-win”.Noise about the legislation misses the point that nothing changes until the delivery plans are in place. That is where the action is. Until they are in place, the existing safeguards persists. And until draft plans are published, there is a vacuum in which alarm can thrive. So let’s debunk some myths.Green spaces will not vanish. Amenity green space is vital for healthy, fulfilling lives, which is why it is a core principle and given protected designation by the government’s new national planning policy framework, and new green spaces created with funds already levied on development. However, local parks and ponds are not great banks of biodiversity, and are no substitute for the woods and wetlands we need at scale. The creation of those habitats will be made possible with the funds levied.Rare habitats such as chalk streams will not be destroyed under the promise of new habitats elsewhere. This is an obviously ridiculous caricature; any such proposal would not pass the hurdles set out in the legislation and NaturalEnglandwould never claim it can create a new chalk stream.This has not been cooked up in a smoke-filled room with the volume housebuilders. On the contrary, I know first-hand that environmental leaders were intimately involved in its development, which is why organisations like RSPB, Wildlife Trust and Green Alliance were supportive when the Bill was published. . Regretfully, some havechanged their tune, and nowprefer to defend regulationsover defending nature.The proposal is not perfect, but it isn’t intended to be. It will take years to be fully implemented and even that is subject to Natural England securing Treasury support in the forthcoming spending review. But it is a serious reform and it must be viewed within the wider context of what this government is doing.The government’s land use framework proposes to support farmers to deliver nature and climate benefits across 1.6 million hectares of land – more than the total developed for housing – by 2050. Meanwhile, it has banned bee-killing pesticides and the burning of peatlands, and its farming roadmap supports a shift towards regenerative farming methods.By comparison, just 30,000 hectares of land will be developed to deliver 1.5m homes this parliament, and, over the same period, if current rates of tree planting are sustained, more than double will be used to create new forests.John Cunliffe’s reviewlooks set to recommend a shift to nature-based solutions to flooding and water pollution. Replacing concrete with more reed- and tree-lined banks will benefit billpayers and the environment.While the government has walked into a fight with environmental groups, it is also quietly getting on with radical change to enhance our green and pleasant land.Nick Williams was an economic policy adviser to Keir Starmer between 2023 and 2025, having previously worked in HM TreasuryExplore more on these topicsPlanning policyOpinionConstruction industryWildlifeEnglandEconomic growth (GDP)commentShareReuse this content"

In presenting its much-heraldedstrategic defence reviewand calling for a new national resolve, it not only treated parliament with contempt – making big policy announcements outside the House of Commons – it gave the country ludicrously exaggerated claims for a “defence dividend”: the idea that increasing investment in the defence sector will boost growth and create high-quality jobs. It failed to explain why money for arms should be a better stimulus for the economy than, say, funding nurseries.The government claims that the world has become so much more dangerous that a “root and branch” review of defence is needed. It claims that transformation and innovation are essential. Except there is very little that is innovative or transformative about the new approach. The programme it has come up with is a doubling down on the old – on the renovation of the “sovereign nuclear warhead” programme (to be mounted on very un-sovereign US-made and maintained missiles), on up to12 new nuclear powered submarines, on cyber and drones, which have been staples in defence procurement discussion for well over a decade. The US remains, despite everything, Britain’s “first partner”, with whom ties should be strengthened. This is no great rupture with the past. And, as many have pointed out, there is a huge gap between the rhetoric and the spending, which will merely increase from 2.3% to 2.5% of GDP.How are we to explain this?Labour has relished the opportunity to present itself as the party of rearmament, just as Tony Blair gleefully believed he was the first to make the Labour party a war party. Its unseemly enthusiasm is reflected in Keir Starmer’s childish talk of “a battle-ready, armour-clad nation” or of British “warriors”. The prime minister even claimed “we will innovate and accelerate innovation to a wartime pace” and become “the fastest innovator in Nato”. This is Labour wanting to become the Tory party of its imagination, to purge itself of the stain of social democracy, to indulge itself in nationalist nostalgia, not least for wartime.There was a time when Labour was proud to claim it was the party of the welfare state. More recently, the Labour right has insisted that it was also the party of the “warfare state” – Nye Bevan’s NHS is proudly paired with Ernie Bevin’s Nato (Bevin was an architect of the north Atlantic alliance). There is more truth in this narrative than many social democrats care to admit: Labour’s postwar government pushed defence spending to around 10% of GDP, under pressure from the Americans. What is too often forgotten is that those in the know knew that such levels of rushed expenditure would not produce what was promised and would damage underlying British growth. Among them were then minister of labour and national service, Nye Bevan, Harold Wilson, president of the Board of Trade, and John Freeman, a junior minister in the Ministry of Supply (that is, of armaments). They resigned and they were proved right.The UK did enjoy a so-called peace dividend from the mid-1950s, as defence expenditure fell relative to GDP and welfare spending. The Labour party now appears to believe that military procurement will generate growth. Khem Rogaly, a researcher at Common Wealth, a progressive thinktank, has studied the relations of defence spending and jobs, and observes that “this is not a serious industrial or jobs strategy”.Still, Starmer claims a “defence dividend” will result from a 0.2 percentage point of GDP increase in spending and that there will be national and regional renewal through arms contracts. This feeds nostalgia for (male) skilled jobs, but it is not a serious proposition. In any case, there is no reason at all to believe that a defence dividend for the economy would be higher than a green energy, housing, NHS, or university dividend – andplenty to believe it will be a lot less. In any case, if defence itself is really as important as they say, there will be very good reasons to continue buying weapons overseas, whichwill happen in practice, instead of pining for national sufficiency. It might be sensible to give the defence dividend to those with a track record of successful design and manufacture, for example, German tank and gun makers, even Ukrainian drone makers.There are some things to welcome in the government’s announcements and the strategic defence review itself. There is a palpable sense that things have gone very wrong, that it is no longer appropriate to think of the UK as having by far and away the best armed services in Europe. The usual dishonest superlatives are lacking. There is nothing “world-beating” here, and only a little is world-leading. The once routine claim that the UK is a force for good in the world is missing. There is recognition that public investment in factories is needed. “Nato first” is better than Tory-era fantasies of an Indo-Pacific tilt.But the fundamental problem remains – there is no thinking about alternative foreign policies or defence policies; the government is still focused on UK defence ties to the Middle East and east Asia. For every sensible proposal, such as the need to build stockpile weapons and improve the procurement machinery, there is a failure to think through the UK’s real place in the world, and to face up to the failures of the defence and foreign policy of the past quarter century.Keir Starmer wants to “mobilise the nation in a common cause” and claims that “nothing works unless we all work together”. But that requires a genuine and serious consensus about aims and consistency in principles. Supporting the territorial integrity of Ukraine, and fighting against the illegal Russian invasion and violations of the laws of war, is a good thing. But it has been noticed by many that the UK has been steadfast in its logistical and political support to an ally, Israel, in illegal occupation of territories that are subject to the war crime of collective punishment on an appalling scale. A root and branch review is indeed desperately needed, but that can only happen if we have a political class prepared to recognise that the old formulas will no longer do. It is easy to talk the talk of change and innovation; achieving that requires a genuine rupture with the assumptions of the past and present.David Edgerton is Hans Rausing professor of the history of science and technology and professor of modern British history at King’s College London.

It’s our politiciansRune LykkebergIn banning a schools debate on Palestinian sovereignty, our leaders have revealed the nation we’re becomingWed 4 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 11.06 EDTShareIn Denmark, we like to think of ourselves as being in the vanguard of freedom of expression. We were the first country in the worldto legalise pornography. We insisted on the right topublish caricaturesof the prophet Muhammad. Rather than marginalise so-called rightwing populists in parliament, weinvited them into political cooperation. We pride ourselves on being unafraid of controversy and we’re good at making authorities who try to tell us what to do – and especially what not to do – look ridiculous.Danes also like to think of our country as a role model for democracy. As such, the national elections forchildren aged 13 to 16are a cherished tradition, considered a part of civic education and a preparation for democratic participation. All schools are invited to take part in the exercise, which is held every other year. Students debate 20 issues for three weeks before casting votes for the parties that are also eligible to stand in real general elections.Over the past few weeks, however, the national school elections have been dragged into controversy after the decision to ban one theme from the list of issues for the 2026 vote:the question of Palestine.Should Denmarkrecognise Palestineas a sovereign state? This specific question is arguably a defining issue of our time and one that mobilises political engagement among young voters. Excluding it is a remarkable act, which has been attackedfrom the leftandright of the political spectrum. This is the opposite of properly preparing young people for Danish democracy, critics say, and goes against what we as a nation stand for.The decision was announced by the speakers of parliament and justified by the two parties that have led Danish governments for the past 30 years:the Social Democrats and the Liberal party. The issue was simply too explosive for classroom deliberations, they argued, and risked placing youngsters from minority groups in very uncomfortable situations. Moreover, it risked giving pupils a bad experience of democracy; this issue was too complex for them to be able to relate tomeaningfully.What’s revealing here is that the same parties would normally support an understanding of democracy that puts the freedom of controversial deliberation and offensive exchange above the protection of minority sensitivity and public order. Culturally, this is the Danish model of democracy: we’re tolerant towards verbal intolerance when it comes to political discourse about Islam and immigration; we’re sceptical of liberal superegos who want to protect minority feelings and public order.But when it comes toIsraeland Palestine, the governing parties promote an understanding of democracy that sets personal sensitivities and public order above free speech and the right to offend. This really is remarkable. When it comes to substantial complexity, it seems beyond dispute that the mechanisms driving the climate crisis, for instance, are harder to grasp than whether Palestinian statehood should be recognised.The real explanation seems obvious. It’s not the schoolkids who can’t handle the Palestine question – it’s the governing parties that are projecting their own failures on to Danish pupils and want to avoid it and all the other questions that addressing it would inevitably provoke:the war in Gaza, Danish arms exports, the tension between Denmark’s alliances with the US and Israel and our obligations towards liberal institutions and the human rights of Palestinians.They seem to enjoy talking about the war in Ukraine, because little Denmark supports the country invaded by its bigger and more powerful neighbour. We unequivocally support the liberal order and international law against the aggressor. Morally, our engagement in Ukraine reveals Denmark as the country we want to be. But our complicity in the war crimes being perpetrated in Gaza reveals us as the nation we’ve become but can’t defend.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If the Russian army were doing to Ukrainians what the Israeli army is doing to the Palestinians of Gaza or in the West Bank, our prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, would be publicly outraged. But she gives the impression of speaking of the suffering of Palestinians only when forced to by circumstances, the agenda or direct questions about it.Frederiksen has repeatedly called the situation in Gaza “tragic” and a “humanitarian disaster”. However, she speaks of the suffering of the Palestinians as if we were innocent bystanders. Yet the Danish government has significant levers it could pull to hold the extremist government in Israel to account. It has just generally chosen not to.Despite its pride in its democratic credentials, Denmark has not initiated a renegotiation of the formal agreement that makes the EU Israel’s biggest trading partner. The Danish government last month supported a review of EU-Israel ties, but it has not suggested sanctions against specific Israeli politicians or Israel as a state and it has not recognised Palestinian statehood, asSpain, Ireland and Sloveniahave already done.Instead, our government continues to allow Danish weapons manufacturers to supply Israel, either indirectly through the US or directly, withspare parts for the F-35 bombersthat the Israel Defense Forces deploy in Gaza. This despite our leaders knowing it violates EU rules, which mandate an obligation to deny the export of military equipment if there’s a “clear risk” that it mightbe used to commit war crimes.Acitizens’ petitiondemanding that Denmark end all direct and indirect weapons exports to Israel has gathered more than 50,000 signatures.Last weekit wasbrought to the floorof parliament. But the debate made it clear yet again that a broad consensusputs the security alliance with the USabove human rights in Gaza.We’re assisting war crimes in Israel while mobilising against them in Ukraine. Our government seems tacitly to accept Palestinians’ suffering as collateral damage of a foreign policy that’s in ruins anyway because it is based on an alliance that the US is disengaging from. Denmark is basically sending arms to a bully and then mourning the consequences of them being used.It is, in this context, revealing that our leaders don’t want our schoolchildren to discuss the recognition of the Palestinian state as part of their education – because they can’t handle it themselves. Our elected representatives don’t want our democracy to expose their failure in the moral scandal of the west in the 21st century.For schoolgoers this controversy is a valuable, if unintended, introduction to democracy. They’ve learned how those in power will always try to define the agenda and limits of democratic participation. It also shows that what young people talk about matters. It can be a way of mobilising the best in our democracy against the worst and of building their power as future voters. And hopefully, the missing question will be the most debated in Denmark’s schools in the coming year.Rune Lykkeberg is editor-in-chief of the Danish newspaper InformationExplore more on these topicsDenmarkOpinionIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

The sickening death toll climbs. Another family face gut-wrenching griefLorena AllamAustralians will rally this weekend to mourn Kumanjayi White, a Warlpiri man with disabilities who stopped breathing after being restrained by NT policeTue 3 Jun 2025 22.55 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 00.28 EDTShareFive years ago thousands of Australians defied Covid restrictionsto pour on to the streets of our cities and townsas part of the global Black Lives Matter movement.The protests here highlighted the appalling rates of Aboriginal people dying in police and prison custody. One death in particular became a rallying point: that ofDavid Dungay Jr, who died while being restrained, pleading that he could not breathe, in similar circumstances toGeorge Floydin the US.The 26-year-old Dunghutti man, who had diabetes and schizophrenia, was in Long Bay jail hospital in November 2015 when five guards stormed his cell after he refused to stop eating a packet of biscuits.Dungay, known to his family as Junior, was dragged to another cell, held face down and injected with a sedative. Inharrowing footagelater shown to the coroner and partly released to the public, Junior said 12 times that he couldn’t breathe before losing consciousness and dying.‘I want to break that cycle’: the relatives still fighting for justice over deaths in custodyRead moreJunior’s family – especially his mum, Leetona, and nephew Paul Silva – have since been catapulted into representing a movement whose ranks are continuously swelled by more grieving Aboriginal families, all of them forced to deal with alienating and opaque processes of police “investigation”, and coronial inquests that take years to get to court, more years to decide what happened to their loved ones, and then all the years after which nothing appears to change.In Junior’s case, the coroner heard that medical staff at Long Bay had failed for periods of up to eight minutes to perform basic CPR. They had then forgotten to remove the safety cap from resuscitation equipment, which came off in Junior’s mouth.The inquest took four years for the coroner to find that while the nurse who administered the sedative might be referred to a professional standards review, none of the guards who restrained Junior should face disciplinary action as their “conduct was limited by systemic efficiencies in training”.As we stood outside the court that day, an aunty asked: “How much training do they need to stop killing our people?”On the streets in 2020, people held up placards with the number 432. At that time, it wasour best calculationof the number of Aboriginal people who had died in custody since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody in 1991.New placards will be needed for this weekend’s rallies in protest at yet another death in custody, in anAlice Springssupermarket last week.The number now stands at 597.Kumanjayi White, a 24-year-old disabled Warlpiri man from Yuendumu died after being restrained by police in the confectionery aisle at theColessupermarket.According to theNorthern Territorypolice assistant commissioner Travis Wurst, two plainclothes officers were in Coles about 1.10pm when they “were alerted to a confrontation” between Kumanjayi and a security guard.After being restrained by the officers, Kumanjayi stopped breathing. He was taken to Alice Springs hospital where he was pronounced dead about an hour later.Kumanjayi had disabilities and was living away from his community in supported accommodation.One wonders what its chief executive and shareholders think of the optics of Coles now being permanently linked to an Aboriginal man’s death involving policeHis unnecessary death is a “tragic case at the intersection of disability and race”, the family’s lawyer, George Newhouse of the National Justice Project, told Guardian Australia.The family, who are sadly experienced in navigating the nightmare world of police, media and the coronial process, have called for an independent investigation – meaning they want it to be conducted by anyone other than the NT police.Given their years of deeply negative interactions with the NT police, it’s understandable.This is the same police force thatshot dead the Warlpiri teenager Kumanjayi Walkerin Yuendumu 2019. The same police force in which Alice Springs officers, including those in leadership roles, were revealed at his inquest in 2022 to have exchanged racist, sexist and homophobic text messages. The same police force alleged to have used military-style tactics in policing, amid allegations of the use of excessive force. The same police force in which the TRG elite group, now disbanded, bestowed a racist mock-award known as the “Coon of the Year” on the officer who behaved “most like an Aboriginal”. The winner was given a club and made to wear a toga.You can see why they might mistrust the outcome of that investigation.The federal minister forIndigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, has said an independent investigation “may be warranted”. The NT Labor opposition leader, Selena Uibo, said she hoped it was “something that could be considered”.But Wurst has already ruled it out.The family has also called on the federal government to convene an Indigenous-led independent oversight body to supervise the investigation of First Nations deaths in custody as a matter of urgency.And, “given the mistrust that exists between the family, First Nations community and the police, it is incumbent on police to show close family members the CCTV and body worn footage of the incident as soon as possible”, Newhouse told Guardian Australia.A glimpse of hope, then another Aboriginal death in custody: ‘grief-stricken’ campaigners mourn lack of progressRead moreThe findings in the Walker inquest were due to be handed down in Yuendumu on 10 June. They will now be postponed while the community comes to terms with yet another senseless violent death involving the NT police.Late on Tuesday a former Coles employee came forward to say he’d known Kumanjayi White and had seen him in the shop from time to time.Gene Hill told the ABChe used to spot Kumanjayi wandering the aisles and would “simply go up to him and grab the products off him and just explain to him that it’s got to be paid for”.He suggested that Coles hire more Indigenous staff with local language skills and better support Aboriginal shoppers with disabilities.Also on Tuesday, Coles finally broke its silence on the matter. A spokesperson said the supermarket was “deeply saddened” and would assist police with their investigations.Almost a week after Kumanjayi White’s death in the lolly aisle, it seems a thin response from a company proud of being “one of the largest private sector employers of Indigenous Australians”, according to its website and its reconciliation action plan.One wonders what its chief executive and shareholders think of the optics of Coles now being permanently linked to an Aboriginal man’s death involving police.As in 2020, rallies are being planned for this weekend in capital cities around the nation, to mourn the loss of another young Aboriginal person, to support another family devastated by the ongoing obscenity of carceral violence.“This is gut wrenching pain. It is sickening. The kind that stops you from eating and keeps you up at night,” Samara Fernandez-Brown, Kumanjayi Walker’s cousin, said in a statement.“I can’t believe this has happened again to a young Warlpiri man, and I am so deeply saddened by the gross injustice of how Kumanjayi White was treated. Absolutely disgraceful.“Has our community not gone through enough?”Lorena Allam is descended from the Gamilaraay and Yuwaalaraay nations of north-western NSW.

Another critic pulled me aside just in time. But then again, she pressed the button to release the airborne poo – fake, I think – in the first place. This is Kara Chin’s funny installation in a cinema recreating the seediness of the seaside with squawking AI seagulls on video screens, chaotic electro-assemblages resembling mutant arcade machines and a floor covered with guano. Liverpool is not by the sea but close enough that seagulls provide a chorus as you walk between Liverpool Biennial art events in museums, galleries, warehouses and community centres.I can’t see the Liver Birds on the skyline without remembering the first time I visited this city as small child, seeing my aunt off on a voyage across the Atlantic, from docks that then loomed with massive ships. Proustian memories of the biggest city I knew as a child return with a vengeance in a raw warehouse space where Turkish artist Cevdet Erek has created a homage to the noise and intensity of soccer crowds. He loves football and loud music. I meet him there and he enthuses about attending Anfield as research, and being inspired by a track on Pink Floyd’s Meddle. Flashbacks of matches with my dad surge.But Erek’s installion is not a literal portrayal of a football game. Instead it transfigures the noise and tension of a big match. The space is dominated by an arena made of brown, earthy bricks while a pounding soundtrack pumps from speakers in its seating areas. It’s eerie and seems ancient, for the pebbly arena and stands make you think as much of gladiatorial games as modern soccer. Vicious drums increase the menace. But there are no people. It’s a ruin excavated in the desert, to which a Floyd of the future have come to perform to the empty air.View image in fullscreenPeople being raised up by angels into the heavens … Maria Loizidou’s crocheted tapestry in Liverpool Cathedral.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe 2025 Liverpool Biennial is entitled Bedrock and its best moments come when artists engage with the emotional bedrock of Liverpool itself – from football to religion. Is there a difference? At Bluecoat contemporary arts centre, Amy Claire Mills shows a bright, booming mural of Liverpool’s coat of arms, reproducing its surreal mythology in which the sea god Neptune, a merman, dolphins and, of course, the Liver Birds all feature.Yet by and large the freshest experiences are to be had in site-specific works outside galleries and museums. The WalkerArtGallery’s Biennial show of unmemorable art is eclipsed by the likes of Hogarth and Millais in its collection. Nour Bishouty has placed a wooden sculpture of a gazelle-like animal, inlaid with mother of pearl, on a plinth below a painting of an outsized ox by Liverpool-born 18th-century artist George Stubbs. Past beats present here.But enter Liverpool’s Anglican cathedral, with its stupendous interior by Giles Gilbert Scott, and you see a veil of colour suspended against its brown craggy heights, a woven work by Cypriot artist Maria Loizidou that depicts people being raised up by angels into the heavens. Its imagery of redemption is positively medieval. Taking religion seriously turns out to be the freshest, most surprisingly successful aspect of this art festival in a multi-faith city.On the Liverpool skyline you can sometimes see both Scott’s neo-medieval pile and the more graceful modernist Catholic cathedral. In the best artwork of the Biennial, Turner prize winner Elizabeth Price explores a question that might not occur to many people but she makes fascinating: how did Britain’s Catholic communities come to build so many modernist churches?View image in fullscreenBright and booming … Deep End by Amy Claire Mills.Photograph: Mark McNultyHer film, in a darkened hall in Liverpool’s Chinatown, uses a suspenseful soundtrack, digital graphics and sinister negative images to ponder this. As Irish Catholic immigration to Britain increased in the 20th century, the growing community had to remedy a lack of Catholic churches. A new one was built around a century ago on Anglesey, the first stop for many Irish immigrants arriving by sea. Price tries to understand why it took a radical modernist form, an upturned ship’s hull moulded in concrete by an Italian architect. She relates it to military architecture, including airship hangars, and the music becomes more threatening. Yet she doesn’t seem satisfied with her own answers – and as a drum throbs, the colours and negative saturation get ever more lurid. For a moment I expected a horror ending, a murder in the cathedral.Instead she takes you inside some of the churches to see their mysticism enhanced by her effects, and it dawns on you. The supernatural force haunting these spaces is – can it be … God?I’d always thought of Price as a gothic artist. But just as William Peter Blatty, author of The Exorcist, was trying to promote the Catholic faith, so in this compelling artwork Price appears to reveal that she is, and always has been, a religious artist.Outside this city roars, profane and riotous, but under the skin it has a soul. The Liverpool Biennial has a lot of forgettable art in it. But at its best it cuts not just to the architectural but the spiritual heart of Liverpool. Huge as that heart is.TheLiverpool Biennialopens 7 JuneExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingInstallationSculptureLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the beginning of the pandemic, we met at 5pm on Skype, Monday through Friday, which became our two-person book club. This continued after the pandemic. The first book we read was The Complete Stories by Elizabeth Bowen. Between that collection and The Hotel, my estimation is that we read between 80 and 120 books. Sometimes we marvelled with fake shivering (Muriel Spark’s The Driver’s Seat, for instance). Sometimes we compared our underlined parts in the books, and when we found we underlined the same adjective, the same phrase, or the same paragraph, we pretended, once again, to be surprised. When we read Henry Green’s novels, Edmund would act the dialogues out in a British accent. There was a detail from a Yasunari Kawabata novel that we returned to often as a private joke: “Are you low on B?” (As in Vitamin B.) “Yes, I feel low on B.” This would be the closest that we would admit that we were feeling saddened by the losses in our lives. Edmund lost many beloveds to Aids; I lost two children to suicide. And yet there was never a heaviness in our conversations. I think Edmund brought a lightness and a cloudlessness into my life. We gossiped, we giggled, and sometimes I would stare at my little screen, dumbfounded, when Edmund enlightened me with a graphic reminisce of gay sex from 20 or 30 years ago, in a castle or back alley in Europe. Then we would stare at each other before bursting into laughter.When we first read Bowen together, sometimes Edmund or I would say, “I wish I could write like this.” And the other person would repeat, “I wish I could write like this.” In a few days, I shall return to America where Edmund Valentine White III is no more, and I shall finish The Hotel by myself. Neither he nor I will make our friendship into fiction. I wish I knew a pair of characters like us in literature.‘He loved gossip and intrigue’Colm TóibínIrish novelistEdmund White wrote with style; he cared about style; he made it seem natural and effortless. He wrote and indeed spoke with a kind of delightful candour. He loved revelation and gossip and intrigue. The idea that everyone he knew had secrets fascinated him. He chuckled a lot. He read all the latest French novels. He saw no reason why he should keep things to himself and, because he was gay in a time when gay life had not appeared much in fiction, that became one of his great subjects.A Boy’s Own Story, which came out in 1982, had enormous influence. It was an essential book for several generations of gay men. In The Beautiful Room Is Empty and The Farewell Symphony, White charted the changes and the tragedies of the gay life that had seemed so promising in A Boy’s Own Story.In writing about gay characters, White also became one of the chroniclers of city life, especially New York and Paris. (During a brief stay in Princeton, he suggested that the only relief from tedium was to howl nightly at the moon.) White was in full possession of a prose style that was deceptive in how it functioned. His writing could feel like conversation or someone thinking clearly and honestly or taking you slowly into his confidence. The cadences were close to the rhythms of speaking, but there was also a mannered tone buried in the phrasing, which moved the diction to a level above the casual and the conversational.The book of his that I love most is his 2000 novelThe Married Man, which is a kind of retelling of Henry James’s The Ambassadors. White dramatises with considerable subtlety the conflict between the idea that the personal is political (“which,” White wrote in 2002, “may be America’s most salient contribution to the armamentarium of progressive politics”) and the legacy of Vichy France filled with secrecy and ambiguity and the ability to live several compartmentalised lives.In the recent years, White’s apartment in Chelsea, shared with his husband, the writer Michael Carroll, was a centre of fun and laughter, a place where you got all the latest news. Books were piled up. They, too, were treated as kind of news. He worked every day, writing at the dining-room table. He made light of his illness. He was, in many essential ways, a lesson to us all.‘I gave his novel a bad review – which positively inflamed his charm’Adam Mars-JonesBritish novelistI met Ed White in London in 1983, at the time of the UK publication of A Boy’s Own Story. I had reviewed the novel for Gay News, and he knew that my verdict was unfavourable but not what my objection was (I described it as a cake that had been iced but not baked). This didn’t deter him from making a conquest of some sort – a degree of resistance could positively inflame his charm. We took a stroll round Covent Garden. I bought him a punnet of whitecurrants, a fruit with which he was unfamiliar, though feigning ignorance in order to please me would have been perfectly in character. He must have registered my lack of carnal interest but went on sexualising our promenade, asking me if one bystander was my type, telling me that another had given me the eye.To have become his friend without even a moment of sexual closeness was, a least at that time in the New York gay world, an anomaly and perhaps even a distinction. I visited Ed several times in Paris, sleeping on the daybed in his enviable flat on the Île Saint-Louis. In the morning he would help his ex-lover John Purcell get ready for a day of graduate study, a routine – as he was well aware – with overtones of a mother packing her son off to school. We would have one more cup of coffee and listen to some chamber music, Poulenc a favourite. Then he would say, “I must get back to thedarlingnovel” (he was working on Caracole at the time), and lie on his bed to write in longhand. I loved those visits, and some of that was down to Paris, but most to his hospitality. For a night in he might buy rabbit loin in mustard sauce pre-prepared from atraîteur,unthinkable sophistication. It was from him I learned that “cutting the nose off the brie” was not just bad manners, as I hadn’t known, but a named crime.He was writing a monthly column for American Vogue, sosocialising was a job requirement as well as a pleasure. Even so, I was mildly scandalised that his French literary friends took it for granted that he would pick up the tab in restaurants.  Priggishly I would treat him to a meal now and then, though I think he took more pleasure in largesse than in the presumption of equality.‘He expanded the bounds of what could be written about’Olivia LaingBritish writerI saw Edmund White on the A train once, like glimpsing an emperor in the grocery shop. I must have been barely in my teens when I first read A Boy’s Own Story, the Picador paperback with the brooding boy in a purple vest on the cover. I was seduced by everything: the lovely, supple, almost shimmering language, the explicit precision applied to sex and class. Cornholing, a word I’d never heard before. Above all, it held out an invitation. It was from White that I realised a writer takes the rough material life gives – unwanted, shabby, maybe repellent – and makes it their own by way of sensibility and style, that alchemical translation.Years later, I met him. He was at an adjoining table when my first American editor took me out for lunch. He was celebrating too, toasting the publication of Justin Spring’s Secret Historian, a book about the unconventional sexual researcher Samuel Steward. It was pure White territory: sex explored exactly and without shame. His presence that day felt like a blessing. He interwove the elegant and the explicit, he expanded the bounds of what could be written about and also how a life could be lived. There is a generation of writers you write for without quite realising it. They set the bar, and then they go. That beautiful room is emptier now.‘His work was as fresh as gay bar gossip’MendezBritish novelistEdmund White was one of those writers whose work was as fresh and immediate as gay bar gossip, but from a place of deeper learning and knowledge. I met him once in 2019, over dinner with Alan Hollinghurst in New York, and he remained every bit as witty and sex-positive as I’d found him in his books. The incredible thing about him is that he was one of very few gay writers to remember the pre-Aids era and survive into old age. When I think of White I think of the bathhouses of 1970s New York City and his conspiratorial storytelling, though that’s not to undersell him as a prose stylist. Such was his keenness to connect with a gay-literate rather than a mainstream, almost anthropologically minded audience, that The Joy of Gay Sex, which he co-wrote, retains a contraband feel to this day.‘He showed us what was really going on’Tom CreweBritish novelistEdmund White was not a gateway to gay literature, or to the gay experience, since that would imply that he was not in himself a main destination. However, he was very often the man who opened the door to the expectant reader, who took them by the elbow, led them inside and eagerly showed them everything that was going on – that wasreallygoing on. There are his novels and his memoirs, of course, with their brave, bracing, dirty and dignifying candour, and his biographies, of Genet,Proust,Rimbaud, not to mention The Joy of Gay Sex, co-authored with Charles Silverstein. But I am thinking especially of States of Desire: Travels in Gay America (1980), which records his visits to the diverse gay communities across the country, before they were united by the internet and representation in mainstream culture. It is of its time – often magnificently so, as in its description of the “San Francisco look”:Edmund White on lust, love and literature: ‘I’d had sex with 3,000 men. A peer asked: “Why so few?”’Read moreA strongly marked mouth and swimming, soulful eyes (the effect of the moustache); a V-shaped torso by metonymy from the open V of the half-unbuttoned shirt above the sweaty chest; rounded buttocks squeezed in jeans, swelling out from the cinched-in waist, further emphasised by the charged erotic insignia of coloured handkerchiefs and keys; a crotch instantly accessible through the buttons (button one already undone) and enlarged by being pressed, along with the scrotum, to one side; legs moulded in perfect, powerful detail; the feet simplified, brutalised and magnified by the boots. For gay men there are three erotic zones – mouth, penis and anus – and all three are vividly dramatised by this costume.But it is also of its time in its repeated, inevitable attention to the brute facts of homophobia and how it crowds, limits and costs lives. The book, accidentally, became a vital record of gay life on the brink of Aids: the epidemic’s outsized impact in the US (which White went on to describe and protest) was a direct consequence of this indulged prejudice. But States of Desire doesn’t memorialise a lost Eden – “Gay life,” White said, “will never please an ideologue; it’s too untidy, too linked to the unpredictable vagaries of anarchic desire.” At one point in his travels, in Portland, he discovered “an unusual degree of integration with the straight community” worthy of remark: “A gay single or couple must deal with the family next door and the widow across the street; the proximity promotes a mixed gay-straight social life – parties, dinners, bridge games, a shared cup of coffee.” It’s a reminder of how amazingly far we’ve travelled. Edmund White was one of the people that brought us here – but he didn’t think integration and toleration, the right to marriage and a family, was an end-point. It was just one sight on the tour, and White showed us, with a proper absence of shame or embarrassment, many others rather more thrilling. Gay life shouldn’t ever mean one thing in particular; but what it can provide, as he wrote in States of Desire, “is some give in the social machine”.‘His books were a fabulous reel of anecdote and savage humour’Seán HewittEdmund White was true giant of letters, the patron saint of queer literature. I can still remember, vividly, reading (in the wrong order), the books of the trilogy from A Boy’s Own Story to The Farewell Symphony, completely absorbed in White’s camp, biting humour, his name-dropping, his ability to capture self-delusion, fantasy, disappointment, anger, lust and romance in a heady, whirling voice. I remember saying to a friend, then, that I thought I could read him for ever.White’s books were a fabulous, unending reel of anecdote and savage humour, attuned to the erotic impulse of writing, full of mincing queens, effeminate boys and brutal men: a fully stocked world of idolatry and abnegation. What stays with me, years later, is not only the biting social observation, but also the religious tenor of his mind, the affinities of his characters with the world of the sacred, of mystics and martyrs, which processed shame with such exuberance of feeling. I felt, in the company of his voice, educated in a secret, glamorous world, which was operatic in its emotion and brilliantly arch in its range of reference.In his final book,The Loves of My Life, White proved himself an iconoclast to the end. Even the epigraph made me chuckle, because I could almost hear him chuckling to himself while setting it down: “Mae West hearing a bad actress auditioning for West’s hit comedy Sex: ‘She’s flushin’ my play down the terlet!’”. His honesty, even in his last years, was still enough to make you wince, still sharp enough to bring a shock of laughter, still melancholy and occasionally self-pitying enough to catch you off guard with all the many sadnesses of the world. I’m grateful that he left us so much work, and that the full, unadulterated sound of his voice is so potent, so convivial, so fresh and living on every page.Explore more on these topicsEdmund WhiteLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was longing for intimacy – yet this was not someone I knew well’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 4 Jun 2025 10.09 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 11.53 EDTShareIt is not an accident that the image here, Another Morning, suggests intimacy; I was in a state of longing for just such intimacy when I made the photograph. Yet the figure was not someone I knew well. She was a guest in a house where I had lived only briefly in West Oakland, California. I’d come to live there after the abrupt collapse of my marriage. I noticed the beautiful light that flowed from a window and touched the sleeper covered only by a white sheet. I captured the moment, and it came to join several photographs I had made over the years of sleeping figures, of my daughter, my sister, my husband sleeping in our hotel room in Merida, Mexico – even sleeping dogs, with limbs entwined. I work towards an idea across a number of images, often over several years.A goal of mine as a photographer has been to find ways to avoid the intrusive aspects of photography. Rather than going out into the world to capture public events, I came to prefer photographing family and people I knew, close to home, since there I could have a legitimate expectation my subjects might not mind being photographed. A sleeping figure doesn’t pose or become self-conscious. It’s as natural as you can be in front of a camera. But it is an intimate thing to photograph someone when they are sleeping – there is no opportunity to obtain consent. Photographers have great potential for being obnoxious. I am always delighted when an image reads with some of the intimacy of feelings that I wanted it to carry. But I didn’t have a complicated idea when I made this photograph – I was following my objective of recording things that were close to me. I’ve always thought of myself as an autobiographer more than as a reporter.A curator slammed shut my portfolio and said: “Ew!’ I was shakenMy attraction to photography began early, visiting exhibitions with my parents as a young girl growing up in Los Angeles. I saw the work ofDorothea Lange, and we visitedEdward Steichen’s famous exhibition, The Family of Man– a postwar exhibition based on the notion that wars could be prevented if the whole of humanity felt more like a family. Generally, I was not often out on the streets making pictures in what might be called a “documentary style”; my term “intimate documentary” came about because I needed a phrase that contradicted the supposition that “documentary photographs” are objective and impersonal.In 1973 – coincidentally, the year ofRoe v Wade– I made a work that represented my miscarriage, a piece calledJournal 1973. Miscarriage is a subject very rarely represented in art. I showed the work at the San Francisco Art Institute, and it was very well received. Soon after, when I was in New York, I boldly made the decision to show it to curators at MoMA. The reception was rather horrible – one curator slammed the portfolio box closed and said: “Ew!” I was shaken; I thought I might never show it to anyone again, and put it away. The images were only published many years later after a colleague at the University of Michigan encouraged me to publish them in the Michigan Quarterly Review.I wasn’t much of a feminist in any way I could articulate at the time, but the feminist movement came to me and embraced me – the work I’d made meant a tremendous amount to feminists I met. The feminist movement in those early years was much stronger on the west coast where I was living, than on the east coast. Feminists in the arts gave me a greater understanding of what I was doing.Under a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, I joined three other photographers documenting “technology in American lives”. I made photographs of home interiors and appliances as my contribution to our project – representing the world from a female perspective. At the time I made them, I didn’t think many of my home interiors pictures were very interesting – but as the years have gone by they’ve become much appreciated and entered significant collections – includingMoMA.“Best shots” are an idea I associate with photojournalism – the capturing of something newsworthy, and at the same time, done with high skill. The intimacy of Another Morning stands somewhat in contrast to the idea of abestshot – it’s a quiet picture rather than a spectacular image, but it’s what I prefer.Joanne Leonard’s CVView image in fullscreenBorn:California, 1940.Trained:BA (1962) from University of California, Berkeley – “I took a few photography classes not long after I graduated.”Influences:“Dorothea Lange; artistsKäthe Kollwitzand Mary Cassatt; my parents, who conveyed a love of art and music, and my twin sister, Eleanor Rubin – also an artist – who continued her work when she had three small children. Many people told me motherhood would make being an artist impossible: Elly gave me confidence I could continue.”High point:“I was the official photographer to the American Winter Olympics team, 1972; my inclusion in the photo-exhibition and book,Vision and Expression (1969), and later, inclusion of my work inInteriors, at MoMA, 2022.”Low point:“I once was hired to photograph a wedding but, developing the film, made a mistake that ruined some of what I (of course) thought were among the best photographs.”Top tip:“I often spent hours preparing fruitless applications for grants that I thought would be validating and financially helpful. I would urge younger photographers to push on as best they can through disappointments. Ultimately, I’ve had plenty of ‘rewards’ though there were certainly daunting moments too.”Joanne Leonard is in conversation at Hackelbury Fine Art on 6 June as part ofLondon Gallery Weekend.

In its wisdom, Nintendo has decided not to send review units out until the day before release, so as you read this I will be standing impatiently by the door like a dog anxiously awaiting its owner.I have played the console, though, for a whole day at Nintendo’s offices, so I can give you some first impressions. Hardware-wise, it is the upgrade of my dreams: sturdier JoyCons, a beautiful screen, the graphical muscle to make games look as good as I want them to in 2025 (though still not comparable to the high-end PlayStation 5 Pro or a modern gaming PC). I like the understated pops of colour on the controllers, the refined menu with its soothing chimes and blips. Game sharing, online functionality and other basic stuff is frictionless now. I love that Nintendo Switch Online is so reasonably priced, at£18 a year, as opposed to about the same per month for comparable gaming services, and it gives me access to a treasure trove of Nintendo games from decades past.But here’s the key word in that paragraph: it’s an upgrade. After eight years, an upgrade feels rather belated. I was hoping for something actually new, and aside from the fact that you can now use those controllers as mice by turning them sideways and moving them around on a desk or on your lap, there isn’t much new in the Switch 2. Absorbed in Mario Kart World, the main launch title, it was easy to forget I was even playing a new console. I do wonder –as I did in January– whether many less gaming-literate families who own a Switch will see a reason to upgrade, given the£400 asking price.View image in fullscreenBrilliant … Mario Kart World.Photograph: NintendoSpeaking ofMario KartWorld, though: it’s brilliant. Totally splendid. It will deservedly sell squillions. Alongside the classic competitive grand prix and time trial races, the headline feature is an open, driveable world that you can explore all you like, as any character, picking up characters and costumes and collectibles, and getting into elimination-style races that span the full continent. All the courses are part of one huge map, and they flow right into one another.Your kart transforms helpfully into a boat when you hit water, and I found an island with a really tricky challenge where I had to ride seaplanes up towards a skyscraper in the city, driving over their wings from one to the other. Anyone could lose hours driving aimlessly around the colourful collection of mountains, jungles and winding motorways here. There’s even a space-station themed course that cleverly echoes the original Donkey Kong arcade game, delivering a nostalgia hit as delightful as Super Mario Odyssey’s climactic New Donk City festival.Pushing Buttons correspondent Keith Stuart alsohad a great timewith another launch game, Konami’s Survival Kids, which is a bit like Overcooked except all the players are working together to survive on a desert island. (Be reassured, if you generally find survival games hard work: it’s very much fun over peril.)However: I would steer clear of theNintendoSwitch Welcome Tour, an almost belligerently un-fun interactive tour of the console’s new features … that costs £7.99. Your tiny avatar walks around a gigantic recreation of a Switch 2 console, looking for invisible plaques that point out its different components. There are displays with uninteresting technical information about, say, the quality of the console’s HD rumble. One of the interactive museum displays shows a ball bounding across the screen and asks you to guess how many frames per second it is travelling at. As someone who aggressively does not care about fine technical detail, I was terrible at this. It’s like being on the least interesting school trip of your life.And it felt felt remarkably un-Nintendo, so dry and devoid of personality that it made me a little worried.Nintendo Labo, by contrast, was a super-fun and accessible way of showing off the original Switch’s technical features. I had assumed that Welcome Tour would be made by the same team, but evidently not.I couldn’t wait to get back to Mario Kart World, which, once again, is fantastic. I’m excited to spend the rest of the week playing it for a proper review. And if you’ve pre-ordered a Switch 2, you’ll have it in your hands in the next 24 hours. For those holding off: we’ll have plenty more Switch 2 info and opinions in the next few weeks to help you make a decision.What to playArms akimbo … to a T is funny and weird.Illustration: Annapurna interactive/SteamLast week I played throughto a T, the beautifully strange, unexpectedly thoughtful new game from Katamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi. It is about a young teenager who is forever stuck in a T-pose, arms akimbo. As you might imagine, this makes life rather difficult for them, and they must rely on their fluffy little dog to help them through life. It’s a kid-friendly game about accepting who you are – I played it with my sons – but it is also extremely funny and weird, and features a song about a giraffe who loves to make sandwiches. I love a game where you don’t know what to expect, and I bet that if I asked every single reader of this newsletter to guess how it ends, not one of you would be anywhere close.Available on:PS5, Xbox, PCEstimated playtime:five hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenTake chances … Remy Siu (left) and Nhi Do accept the Peabody award for 1000xRESIST.Photograph: Charley Gallay/Getty images1000xRESIST, last year’s critical darling sci-fi game about the immigrant experience and the cost of political resistance,won a Peabody awardthis week.

The retrospective about to open in the UK should be electrifyingStuart JeffriesWed 4 Jun 2025 08.32 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 08.45 EDTShareIn 2019, Sotheby’s sold a painting of a little girl with a conservative side parting, a Peter Pan collar and the most unflinching green eyes – which stare down the viewer. It went for $25m, which makes it Japan’s most expensive painting. And it is a knife crime waiting to happen. The girls gaze is as withering as those in Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon. Her eyes follow you as inescapably as Lord Kitchener’s in the first world war recruitment poster. But Nara’s’s painting, Knife Behind Back (2000), is more upsetting than either of those. Most chilling is what we don’t see; it’s all about the power of titular suggestion.This nameless girl is a variation on a theme that Nara has been developing in his paintings since art school in the 1990s. Inspired by both Japanesekawaii(cute) and Disney twee, his cherubic, cartoonish figures with oversized heads resemble psychotic Kewpie dolls. “People refer to them as portraits of girls or children,” says curator Mika Yoshitake. “But they’re really all, I think, self-portraits.” In an interview for the Hayward’s exhibition catalogue, Nara confirms this. “When I paint I always think the canvas is like a mirror.” Not just a mirror on society, but a mirror on the artist. These little girls with big heads and bug eyes are a sexagenarian male working out his demons.View image in fullscreenMissing in Action, 1999, by Yoshitomo Nara.Photograph: Courtesy of Sally and Ralph Tawil and Yoshitomo Nara FoundationNara’s characters – which can be seen at the Hayward Gallery’s bracing new retrospective, though sadly not the knife girl – have become as iconic as Warhol’s Marilyns or Lichtenstein’s blonde bombshells, and just as marketable as posters, T-shirts and coasters. But that was hardly Nara’s intention in painting them. “I kind of see the children among other, bigger, bad people all around them, who are holding bigger knives,” he says.Japanese art isn’t supposed to be like this. Its purpose, for western viewers at least, is to charm and detach us from reality. A short walk from Nara’s current Hayward retrospective is the other Japanese summer blockbuster,Hiroshige: Artist of the Open Road. The British Museum exhibition includes the early 19th-century master’s bird paintings, heart-catching landscapes and decorous urban scenes from Japan’s Edo period. But the blurb for the show rightly suggests how the extremely popular artist tended to favour beauty over realism. And last year’s exhibition of Yoshida woodblock prints at the Dulwich Picture Gallerywas criticisedfor air-brushing out Japan’s more violent history.The point is not that so much Japanese art has a problem; rather that we westerners do. We yearn for art as garden of delights while the rest of the world is on fire. And galleries overwhelmingly give us what we wish for. We got it during, say, Somerset House’s spirited,merch-friendlykawaiiexhibitionor in Yayoi Kusama’sInfinity Rooms at Tate Modern. Only when I visited the Young Victoria and Albert Museum’s 2023 showJapan: Myths to Mangahave I seen a recent exhibition that has set Japanese art in anything like a satisfying historical context.View image in fullscreen‘I kind of see the children among other, bigger, bad people … with bigger knives’ … Yoshitomo Nara at the Guggenheim Bilbao’s 2024 exhibition of his work.Photograph: Miguel Tona/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockNara’s art isn’t like this at all. It’s rough and ready, unafraid to be ugly, snarling with unsubtle anti-nuke agitprop graffiti, sometimes scrawled on old envelopes, and steeped in British and American rock’n’roll. On this last point, it’s worth noting Nara especially digs the Ramones. He once did an acrylic painting of a big-headed girl with a raised fist shouting into a mic entitled “Hey ho! Let’s go!” – a quotation from the Ramones’ Blitzkrieg Bop.That love for rock’n’roll came early. As a lonely latchkey kid raised by working-class parents in Hirosaki, a remote town at the top of Honshu, Japan’s main island, Nara found solace by tuning into the Far East Network, an American station broadcasting to US service personnel at the nearby Misawa military base. He listened to western music on his self-made transistor but didn’t (at the time) understand the words.Nara became obsessed with both the music and the cover art of the singles and albums he collected. He was enchanted by the wildflowers on the cover of Luke Gibson’s 1971 album Another Perfect Day. He loved John Hiatt’s Overcoats album cover depicting the singer songwriter standing waist deep in a lake. This image inspired Nara’s lovely 1995 painting In the Deepest Puddle II in which one of his big eyed poppets, this time with a bandaged head (a recurring motif), stands in a pool of water.View image in fullscreenBig head … Sotheby’s handlers with Yoshitomo Nara’s Cosmic Eyes (in the Milky Lake) earlier this year.Photograph: WIktor Szymanowicz/NurPhoto/REX/ShutterstockThroughout his childhood Nara drew and painted. “Painting,” he told one interviewer, “was my playmate.” It has remained so. He made his first artwork aged six. “I made an illustratedkamishibaistory about my cat and me travelling together to the north pole, and then going all the way down to the South Pole,” he told the New York Times in 2020. “I was lonely and animals and music were a great comfort.”Music was and remains both comfort and catalyst: throughout his career he has listened to music in the studio. He would hear a song – say the Clash’s Death or Glory or Del Amitri’s Nothing Ever Happens – and draw or make a painting, often very loosely inspired by it. He’s also made art for bands: The sleeve for REM’s 2001 single I’ll Take the Rain, for instance, includes Nara’s depiction of a crown-wearing dog on a homemade skateboard.In 1988, after graduating from the Aichi University of the Arts, Nara decided to study at the Staatliche Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf. He remained in Germany for 12 years, where he concocted his most characteristic artistic moves: he would often paint a single figure in pastel with thick cartoonish lines. These figures seem innocuous but on closer inspection disclose that they are carrying weapons and wearing expressions like those of a toddler crossly awoken from a nap by an importunate adult.View image in fullscreen‘Painting was my playmate’ … After the Acid Rain, 2006, by Yoshitomo Nara.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and private collectionNara returned to Japan in 2000 to find many fellow artists subscribing to Takeshi Murakami’s Superflat postmodern art movement. Its followers drew on manga and anime and what Murakami called the “shallow emptiness of Japanese consumer culture”. While Nara was long associated and exhibited with these so-called SoFlo artists, his work was never as ironic. His art has never been celebration nor critique of theotakusensibility that the Superflat movement critiqued.Otakuis the Japanese term used to describe geeky young people obsessed with manga, video games and computers and withdrawn from the real world.It might seem that Nara’s moody staring girls depict just suchotakualienation, but that isn’t quite right. While his art expresses obliquely his own loneliness, there is nothing ironic or cleverly po-mo about it. Nara is too ardent, too political and too keen to express authentic emotion to be truly Superflat. “Punk rock,” he said once, “taught the 17-year-old me not to think with my top-heavy head, but to feel with my body”.In 2011, his art was revolutionised by natural disaster: “What really changed the way I work was the tsunami that hit the north-eastern part of Japan in 2011.” The Great East Japan earthquake unleashed the tsunami that damaged reactors at the Fukushima nuclear plant and devastated large parts of his home prefecture. For several months he was so traumatised that he could scarcely work. When he returned to his studio, the first works he made were in clay that he worked in a seeming rage. It was as if he was physically attacking the lumps of clay he fashioned into sculptures of yet more innocent and/or troubled little girls.While Nara has always opposed nuclear power (as paintings such as No Nukes, 2004, and After the Acid Rain, 2006, indicate), he became more politically vocal after 2011. He leant his imagery to anti-war and anti-nuclear banners. In an agitprop acrylic on board painting from 2019, a big-headed girl makes her reappearance beneath the slogan Stop the Bombs.View image in fullscreenFountain of Life by Yoshitomo Nara, 2001.Photograph: © Yoshitomo Nara, courtesy Yoshitomo Nara FoundationNara is unapologetic about making such political art. “Now, even in this very moment, there is a bomb exploding somewhere in the world,” he writes on his website. “But there must also be new life coming into the world in that moment. ‘STOP THE BOMBS!’ I feel this from the bottom of my heart.” More recent works such as No War Girl and Peace Girl express a similarly pacifist message.Arguably Nara has always been political in a broader sense. Way back in 1994, he made a shocking painting called Dead Flower. A little girl with blood falling from her lips and the words “Fuck You!” written in blood on her back, has just sawn through a flower with a dripping serrated blade.I imagine that this little horror has just killed the last flower in the world just to keep the bare lightbulb at the top of the picture alight. If so, it’s an allegory of climate catastrophe. If not, it’s still terrifying. Either way, you’ll be able to see it in the Hayward’s show as a timely reminder that Japanese art doesn’t have to be detached from reality – nor simply beautiful.At the Hayward Gallery, London, from 10 June to 31 August.Explore more on these topicsPaintingArtJapanJapan disasterSouthbank CentreMangafeaturesShareReuse this content"

What actually happens in the world of movie reporting can be yet more murkyWed 4 Jun 2025 10.04 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 12.56 EDTShareIt is no surprise that Austrian newspaper Kurier’sClint Eastwoodinterview went viral over the weekend. An audience with a 95-year-old film legend containing stern words about the current state of cinema was always going to go like a rocket. Particularly during the industry’s dregs season: the thin period post Cannes and pre the summer proper, with Mission: Impossible fever fading fast and Lilo & Stitch ruling the box office – a success from which only so many stories can be spun.Further evidence of this thinness comes from a quick scan of the news stories run over the past week in some of the trade magazines – Variety, Hollywood Reporter, Deadline, Screen International – who must keep producing them, regardless of actual material. These include a write-off of an interview in which Michael Cera says he didn’t think Jackie Chan knew who he was when they first met, Renée Zellweger revealing that she shed a tear shooting the Bridget Jones film that was released last February and – an exclusive, this – a report that Bill Murray will appear at a film festival in Croatia. Against this backdrop, Eastwood telling younger directors to buck up is, basically, Watergate.Yet the waves the interview made do appear to have come as a surprise to the publication in which it ran. And, in a way, that itself is no surprise, for most of the apparatus of film journalism remains weirdly rooted in a pre-internet era, one in which Google translate doesn’t exist and 18 sets of roundtable interviews, conducted over at least a decade, can absolutely constitute a new article.Clint Eastwood calls viral interview a fabrication: ‘Entirely phony’Read moreWhat the paper does regret, according to itsstatement, is suggesting it was an “interview” rather than a “birthday profile”, implying that the writer, Elisabeth Sereda, mis-sold them her access – which is why they will no longer be working with her.If this is true, it raises further questions. Interviews of this nature generally involve considerable back and forth (say 150 emails) between a commissioning editor, writer, picture editors, film publicist, personal publicist and more. Assuming none of these happened, it still feels concerning that the paper never confirmed when, where or how Sereda spoke to such a major, reticent – and elderly – star.View image in fullscreenDenzel Washington speaks with press on the red carpet at the Highest 2 Lowest premiere in Cannes.Photograph: Manon Cruz/ReutersMore confusingly, as well as describing its writer’s approach to quote-gathering as basically kosher, Kurier’s statement goes on to further tout her credentials. Sereda, it says, “has been in the Hollywood business for decades, conducting interviews with the biggest stars … Her closeness to them is undoubtedly well known.“This is also due, among other things, to the fact that Sereda is a member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the association that awards the Golden Globes and reports from Hollywood for international media.”The Hollywood Foreign Press is a defunct organisation, disbanded in 2023 after decades of accusations of unprofessionalism, bribery and misconduct by some of its members – international showbiz writers of hazy credentials and uncertain identity.The Golden Globes, which it did indeed dish out, were so discredited that they were boycotted by publicists, stars and broadcasters, and the association then had to issue multiple apologies for its lack of transparency and diversity (not a single black writer), before relaunching a couple of years ago.Austrian newspaper cuts ties with writer over Clint Eastwood ‘exclusive’Read moreWriters such as Sereda and many of the original members of the HFPA – like many film journalists, many of them reporters of integrity and expertise – rely to a greater or lesser extent on access granted at film festivals. This access is brief, chaotic and non-exclusive. When I worked for another publication 20-odd years ago, I remember being at such roundtables involving one or two stars and perhaps a dozen sharp-elbowed correspondents from countries across the world.After a bruising 20 minutes, you would be left with a challenging tombola of quotes about, perhaps, an especially niche style of cinematography, whether the star might one day visit Latvia and a lot of bland waffle about how marvellous the director was. Getting a question of your own in was rare. Getting a good piece out of the results was rarer.It is possible to make a living on such access, if you trot around all the festivals – Sundance, Berlin, Cannes, Venice, Toronto – and remain in favour with a couple of publications, and, most crucially, the publicists. A certain level of sycophancy is essential – and, happily, appears to be far from a stretch for many of the writers. Sereda’s Instagram page, for instance, is populated by wide-smiled selfies of her with assorted A-listers. These are posted in the event of a new interview, a new movie or their death.Such unabashed celeb-worship is absolutely common practice in film journalism, even among the most respected Hollywood pundits. I remember one brilliant writer who would post a selfie with a recently deceased star with such speed after news broke of their death that the gesture morphed from the morbid into the faintly suspicious. Could it be that they were the common factor behind all these tragedies?Thick skins, malleable standards and dribble: this is how a lot of this world works. Luckily, the Guardian is a publication with sufficient leverage that it does not need to rely on roundtable access – and would generally not accept it, unless for background, ahead of a 1:1. But much of the access that we are often offered and the circumstances of it is, still, sausage factory stuff: you probably don’t want to know.That roundtables persist is evidence of how much the film industry remains wedded to print publicity. Twenty years ago, the same ragbag quotes appearing in an Austrian broadsheet as well as, say, a Swedish film quarterly and an Australian celebrity magazine, would have gone unnoticed. Today, it makes much less sense. But despite the primacy of streamers and, more broadly, the whole tech-revolution of the past two decades, online versions of articles are of much less concern to publicists than the print version.Juror #2: the curious case of the missing Clint Eastwood filmRead moreWhy? Because clients need presenting with something concrete, a hard glossy copy with a pre-approved photo of themselves on the cover – even if this is seen by perhaps 100th of the people who will read it online. That this is still the case is something I find very curious.Yet maybe the clients are changing. It was, after all, none other than Eastwood himself who first flagged the dodginess of the Kurier article. He had, in fact, said all those things. He just hadn’t said them recently, or knowingly given an audience to that writer, for that newspaper.A new interview with him would be gold-dust because Eastwood did not do press for his most recent movie, Juror #2, which went straight to streaming in the US, after rumours of a rift between the director and the incoming head of studio Warner, David Zaslav (Eastwood didn’t even show up to the premiere).Was Eastwood – now shooting his new movie – concerned these historic quotes would be interpreted as a broadside against Zaslav? Or is he, in his 10th decade, simply paying more attention than the rest of us?Explore more on these topicsFilm industryFilm criticismNewspapersClint EastwoodanalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s part of Chance’s self-published collection of short stories and poems, entitled Pandemic Soup for the Soul, a reflection on “what we experienced during the pandemic crisis”, she shared with me in a recent phone call. “It’s crazy how they maintained control and instilled fear within us. When you’re locked up, you ask yourself … are you going to be angry, or are you going to find what your calling and purpose is?”Alabama paid a law firm millions to defend its prisons. It used AI and turned in fake citationsRead moreLocked Down is also one of 16 tracks onBending the Bars, a hip-hop album featuring original songs by artists formerly or currently incarcerated in Florida’s Broward county jails (with the exception of Chance, a Florida native). Bending the Bars was organized by the south Florida abolitionist organizationChip– the Community Hotline for Incarcerated People – which was initially founded to support inmates during the early days of Covid. Nicole Morse, a Chip co-founder and associate professor at the University of Maryland, says the organization began fielding calls in April 2020, primarily from Broward, the county just north of Miami-Dade; the calls were primarily about medical neglect, abuse and an atmosphere of abject fear, perpetuated by guards who demanded silence.It’s no secret that the prison-industrial complex is inherently abusive, especially Florida’s, which has one of thehighest incarceration rates per capita. As Morse explained in an interview, “Most jails and prisons have an element of violence, retaliation, coercion – it’s what the system relies on to control people.” And Broward county is uniquely punitive: “Broward county jails are standouts in how lawless they seem to be, how much the corrections officers are authorized to act without any oversight.” Last year, it wasreportedthat 21 inmates had died in Broward jails since 2021,prompting the NAACPto declare the need for an investigation. In 2021, the data Chip had gathered was used to support a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida and Disability Rights Florida on behalf of individuals suffering from Covid in the Broward county jail.View image in fullscreenGary Field and Kashdat in the recording studio.Photograph: Noam BrownSomething more hopeful was emerging from those hotline calls, too: creativity. “People wanted to share their latest poetry or a song they were developing,” Morse said. “Art was helping people survive an incredibly desperate time.” Noam Brown, a children’s musician and Chip committee member, began dreaming up the idea of an album; Morse, whose research looks at LGBTQ+ cultural production, particularly collaborative media production with incarcerated artists, co-signed the project. They wanted to do more than simply raise awareness. “When you look at how raising awareness functions politically, people who are not impacted by the system tend to get overwhelmed and apathetic, because the system is so violent,” Morse said. Instead, Chip hoped to create a platform for the wealth of talent they continually encountered. The organization began fundraising, applying for grants and putting the word out that they were producing an album; Gary Field, an incarcerated organizer, writer and scholar, became the executive producer, helping to connect the artists with Chip.Musicians on the inside used two phones to record their songs – one as the microphone to record their vocals, the other to listen to the beat. “The challenges were phenomenal,” Field shared in a phone call. “People couldn’t even talk to their families, never mind collaborate on something as complicated as producing a studio album. We were in the middle of a pandemic. There were four phones and 40 inmates trying to use them.” Spaces with two easily accessible phones were limited; the duration of any prison phone call is restricted. But Chip covered the costs of the calls, while Brown’s brother, Eitan, worked as the sound engineer, and the Grammy-winning children’s artists Alphabet Rockets helped create beats. Artists who were already out were able to spend time in the studio, including Chance, who returned to southFloridaafter her release. After reconnecting with a former classmate, the two attended a meeting for Chainless Change, a Lauderhill-based non-profit advocating for those affected by the criminal legal system. “It was divine – I don’t believe in accidents; I knew I was being called to go back to Florida,” Chance said. She began working with the group and helped organize a poetry event, where she met Field, Brown and Morse. She asked if they had room on the album for one more.The result is nearly an hour of uniquely south Floridian hip-hop and R&B, both of which are constellations of so many genres – Caribbean beats, southern bass, Deep City soul, Miami drill – poetic musings on love, loneliness and hope, and demands for systemic change to the draconian and brutal conditions of the Florida prison system. While Morse noted that the album’s sound quality was impaired by technical limitations, Bending the Bars is polished and clear, an accomplishment owed partly to its production and mostly to the ingenuity of its artists: singers, rappers and collaborators like J4, dangeRush and Chuckie Lee, all of whom alchemized the tracklist into a textural tapestry: playful, mournful, educational and intentionally dotted with prerecorded interjections from the prison phone line (“you have one minute remaining”). Field, whose song Tearing Down Walls and Building Bridges closes the album, studied theology at Columbia University and received his master’s from Gulf Coast Bible College, and has contributed 2,000 pages of writing to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology civic media project Between the Bars. He knows, intimately, the significance of the writing process. “I remember, as an inmate back in 2010, what a profound sense of gratitude the opportunity to write gave me,” he shared. “The relationship between writing, rap, hip-hop, music, jails, prison – it’s really intertwined.”View image in fullscreenBending the Bars artists Kashdatt, Chuckie Lee and ZQ recording in the studio.Photograph: Noam BrownCounty jails, Field added, are incubators for hip-hop, especially in Broward county, which cultivated “legends like Kodak Black and YNW Melly … but the diversity of voices on Bending the Bars is a natural extension of the eclectic mix of detainees that can be found in almost any urban jail”. Field added that space for writing, and a deeper understanding of philosophical ideology, are inevitable on the inside. “While on an academic level, philosophy can be broken down into many categories – ontology, epistemology, ethics, morality – in its simplest sense, philosophy is man’s attempt to figure out the world around him and his place in it,” he said. “When that world is reduced to what lies behind the razor wire, an old-timer who has served 35 years … can provide more wisdom than someone with a PhD in metaphysics.”The system often censored mail or blocked phone calls during the recording process; Morse said that this necessitated new pathways for the collaborators to connect with each other. “We had to develop a set of strategies to overcome those barriers,” they said. “The project was made without the cooperation of any prison or jail. Every strategy we came up with for how to get through to people, how to connect with them, how to find them if they seem to have disappeared in the system – we can now share those strategies with loved ones of incarcerated folks who don’t have any additional privileged access.” It’s for this reason that Chip hopes the album will serve as a model for ways of interacting with and caring for those inside the system – and for future creative endeavors. “Gary always says there’s thousands of jails in the country, and in each one, there are folks who have as much talent as the people we connected to,” Morse added. “We did this independently and autonomously. We hope this inspires others.” In 2026, Chip will release a documentary about the process.After our call, which was cut off due to time restrictions, Field sent an email describing the prison-industrial complex as “an insidious and intentional campaign” that, he warned, is an ongoing harbinger of societal abuse, regardless of a person’s criminal background. “If allowed to continue unchecked, it will not be content with feeding upon the poor, minorities, those suffering from substance abuse issues and undocumented immigrants. How long until the weaponization of the justice department begins to target journalists, educators, scientists, researchers, protesters and even some politicians as enemies of the people? The time to recognize, organize and speak out is now.” It’s a point he illustrates in his song: “Well, they’ve criminalized mental illness and treat addiction as a crime / How long do you think this moves from the shadows to prime time? / … Won’t you raise your voice / Help someone to stand up / Silence is a choice.”Bending the Bars is released on 11 JuneExplore more on these topicsHip-hopUS prisonsCoronavirusFloridaRapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The piece was titled Cuerpo, Spanish for “body”, and the photographs and footage alone are shocking, mournful and distressing, as volunteers take turns holding his body aloft to prevent the real risk of asphyxiation.In conceiving the work, the Cuba-born, New York-based Afro-Latinx artist viewed hundreds of photographs of public lynchings from across the US – a brutal history of normalised extrajudicial violence that has moved artists from Billie Holiday to film-maker Steve McQueen. Those lynchings were also a kind of public performance: of terror, dehumanisation and white supremacy.“I couldn’t put into words everything I thought and felt during the development of the work; it was a very profound and intense experience for me,” Martiel says, over email. “When I was finally taken down and went into the gallery director’s office to rest, I cried inconsolably for about 20 minutes. That had never happened to me before.”View image in fullscreenCarlos Martiel’s work Cuerpo.Photograph: Don Lewis/Carlos MartielIn June, Martiel will present the video of his Cuerpo performance atDark Mofofestival in lutruwita/Tasmania. He’ll also premiere a new live performance titled Custody, which reflects on “police brutality, incarceration, and death of racialised bodies” globally, including within First Nations communities in Australia. For two hours, Martiel will stand naked and restrained in a large hourglass structure in Hobart’s City Hall, as sand rises to subsume and compress his body.For many years, Martiel’s flesh and blood has been his means of expression. For 2009’s Marea, he was buried up to his neck on a Havana beach as he waited for the tide to rise; in 2010’s Espíritus acuartelados, he struggled to free himself from under the combat-booted foot of another performer. For 2017’s Continente, he had nine small diamonds embedded in his skin and then lay in a New York gallery while a white man cut them out.While many of his works are documented in photography and video, he believes that there are some things that can only be expressed through live performance, that the empathetic nature of performance unlocks something between audience and artist that a sculpture or painting can’t.View image in fullscreenCarlos Martiel stands inside his art project The Blood of Cain at the Malecon waterfront during the 13th Havana Biennial art fair in 2019.Photograph: Sven Creutzmann/Mambo Photo/Getty ImagesThe content of his work, he says, is informed by “the contradictions and nonconformities that living in the Cuban context generated in me”.Born in Havana in 1989, in a time of economic crisis and social upheaval at the tail end of the cold war, Martiel witnessed the intersecting realities of race, inequality, homophobia and government repression from a young age. “Ideas become clear for anyone under that breeding ground,” he says.Art became “an escape route, a refuge, a firearm, and a means to express myself freely in that scenario”.Martiel developed his particular brand of art while studying goldsmithing at Havana’s Academy of Fine Arts, when he started making drawings using a dilution of blood, iron oxide, vinegar and charcoal.“Clandestinely, I had to go to public clinics and ask the nurses to take my blood to use it as paint later,” he says. “At first, they helped me in the process, but given how often I went, they stopped doing it, which frustrated me.”He cut out the intermediary, and started exposing his body to physical and psychological extremes, influenced by Cuban and Cuban American artists such as Tania Bruguera and Coco Fusco, as well as Marina Abramović, Regina Galindo, Paulo Nazareth and Ayrson Heráclito.Initially, lacking money or access to Havana’s conventional art spaces, Martiel started out by mounting public performances and interventions. But as his profile grew, he was invited into some of the art world’s most prestigious spaces. In 2021, as part of his Monument series, he stood naked with his hands cuffed behind his back in the middle of the Guggenheim Museum’s iconic white rotunda.View image in fullscreenCarlos Martiel performs Monumento ll at the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, New York in 2021.Photograph: Enid Alvarez/Courtesy of Dark MofoWhile his body of work is steeped in the context of his home country of Cuba and his adopted home of the US, the questions he addresses are, sadly, transnational.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While developing Custody, Martiel was in touch with Caleb Nichols-Mansell, a Tasmanian Aboriginal artist and cultural adviser for Dark Mofo, who he says “shared a lot of information with me about the story and specifically about the situation First Nations people face there regarding deaths in police custody. That conversation greatly influenced how I approached the issue.”While Martiel’s work is often confronting, he isn’t driven by shock value or merely replicating the trauma and subjection inflicted on marginalised bodies.“The topics I address are painful … but I never fall into the aesthetics of shock or gratuitous pain,” he says. “The elegance of visual language and the transmission of knowledge through art have always been vital to me.”And while many of his works have referenced past and historical traumas, his work is as much a response to the present.“It’s sad to look back on the past, but even more heartbreaking to observe the present and see everything we’re witnessing daily,” he says, invoking Trump’s America, Ukraine and Palestine.“If this isn’t colonialism at its finest, I don’t know what is. Every day, I believe less in justice; all I have left is the consolation of poetic justice, which I allow myself to profess through art, my main avenue of expression, struggle, and resistance.”For Martiel, it means his experience in that Los Angeles gallery in 2022 has only deepened in meaning.“With all that we see daily in the world, I think it encompasses many more meanings than I felt at its execution. Maybe it is wrong for me to say it, but I think it makes more sense every day that passes.”As part of Dark Mofo festival, Carlos Martiel’s videoCuerpowill be exhibited at The Old Bank, Hobart, from 5-8 June and 12-15 June; the artist will performCustodyfrom 7.30-9.30pm on Saturday 14 June at City HallExplore more on these topicsDark MofoPerformance artArtVideo artTasmaniaHobartfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You know, the grade, the colour spectrum – it’s a completely different experience. Audiences want things which are real and authentic and connect them with the history of the media.“The Filmhouse is a venue that is able to offer that experience in a way that few other venues can.”The cinema, which will have four screens, is reopening after a major community-led campaign to save it, launched by senior staff and board members when itclosed suddenlyin October 2022 after a financial crisis.Simpson, hired from the Tyneside cinema in Newcastle, said the venue would again become a hub for independent film festivals, and make great use of its collection of heritage film projectors.The Filmhouse’s original set of 70mm, 35mm, 16mm and 8mm projectors, as well as television broadcast-grade equipment that used large, so-called “exhibition tapes” known as Beta SPs, allow it to screen a huge range of current and historic films.The venue also has modern digital projectors, but the collection of heritage machines was quite rare in the UK, Simpson said. “We’re here to celebrate full diversity of film, to celebrate the full history of cinema, and actually being able to display films on those formats is a really vital an important part of that mission.”He said the use of those traditional formats “really connects with audiences”. The Glasgow Film Theatre had a bigger box office when it screened The Brutalist, starring Adrien Brody, in 70mm than it had during its original opening weekend three weeks earlier.The “open the doors” campaign to save the Filmhouse, backed by stars and patrons such as Brian Cox, Dougray Scott, Charlotte Wells and Jack Lowden, raised £324,000, and won £1.5m in UK government funding and backing from the agencies ScreenScotlandand Creative Scotland.The refurbished cinemas, complete with new seating and a reopened bar and restaurant, are being leased for 25 years from the building’s current owners, the pub and restaurant chain Caledonian Heritable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Filmhouse is expected to again become a festival venue.Simpson said the “extraordinary” success in reopening the Filmhouse should embolden and encourage community campaigners elsewhere. “It can offer some real sort of hope for how local communities can fight to hold to the things that are really kind of important to them,” he said.Explore more on these topicsScotlandEdinburghEdinburgh film festivalFestivalsShareReuse this content"

Where would you go from here? It usually comes out with garbage, but sometimes there is something in it that gives you another idea.”The use of AI is a hugely contentious issue in the music industry.This year, Dua Lipa and Paul McCartney were among hundreds of artists whosigned an open letterurging the prime ministerto protect artists’ copyright and not “give our work away” to big tech.Ulvaeus said he believes AI is a collaborator rather than a creative threat.“It’s fantastic. It is such a great tool,” he added. “It is like having another songwriter in the room with a huge reference frame. It is really an extension of your mind. You have access to things that you didn’t think of before.”The new musical is far from Ulvaeus’s first flirtation with technology.Abba Voyage, the concert which launched three years ago in a purpose-built arena featuring digital avatars of the band members, has been a huge success and was described as a “dazzling retro-futurist extravaganza” by the Guardian.Thank you for the music: Abba members get Swedish knighthoodsRead moreIt was a risky venture as Pophouse Entertainment, the company behind the project needed to bring in £140m in order to break even.He told the audience at SXSW London that he embraced experimental approaches to songwriting and studio technology much earlier in his career.This experimental approach is characteristic of Ulvaeus’s career-long fascination with technological innovation.During his time inAbba, he – along with bandmate Benny Andersson – “always wanted the latest thing”, and were among the first to use the Minimoog synthesiser and to use digital recording machines in their studio.“We were always on the lookout for, you know, you would hear a sound on the record. How was that done? And then you get that stuff,” said.The Abba songwriter told the audience that he sees AI as the latest evolution in his career rather than a threat, which is how it is perceived by many.“I actually wake up curious every morning,” Ulvaeus said, explaining the drive that has kept him creating decades after Abba’s peak. “Everything’s really after our wanting to try new things.”Explore more on these topicsAbbaArtificial intelligence (AI)SXSWFestivalsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

He said: “The problems with my voice are one of many grounds for uncertainty about my creative future.” He said that he was currently unable to express himself with his voice: “I don’t feel like singing, and for me that’s a sign.”Bandmate Magne Furuholmen said all future band-related activities “will of course be tuned to suit Morten’s situation”.Harket broke the news on the A-ha website inan interview with band biographer Jan Omdahl. “I’ve got no problem accepting the diagnosis,” he said. “With time I’ve taken to heart my 94-year-old father’s attitude to the way the organism gradually surrenders: ‘I use whatever works.’”There is no current cure for Parkinson’s. In 2024, Harket underwent neurosurgery at the Mayo clinic in the US to implant electrodes inside the left side of his brain, followed by a similar procedure on the right side in December. The devices connect to a small device, similar to a pacemaker, placed under the skin of the upper chest that stimulates the brain by sending electrical impulses through the electrodes. The procedures gave him a dramatic improvement in his symptoms.Harket said: “I’m trying the best I can to prevent my entire system from going into decline. It’s a difficult balancing act between taking the medication and managing its side effects. There’s so much to weigh up when you’re emulating the masterful way the body handles every complex movement, or social matters and invitations, or day-to-day life in general.”A-ha: how we made Take on MeRead moreHarket said that he didn’t hope to regain “full technical control” over his vocals but that he had been working on songs “that I’ve got great belief in, and I feel the lyrics, especially, have something of a different aspect of me in them.“I’m not sure if I’ll be able to finish them for release. Time will tell if they make it. I really like the idea of just going for it, as a Parkinson’s patient and an artist, with something completely outside the box. It’s all up to me, I just have to get this out of the way first.”He told fans that his identity wasn’t rooted in being a singer. “I see singing as my responsibility, and at certain moments I think it’s absolutely fantastic that I get to do it. But I’ve got other passions too, I have other things that are just as big a part of me, that are just as necessary and true.”Furuholmen said in an Instagram post on Wednesday: “It is a day of sad news in A-ha world. Having known about Morten’s diagnosis for some time does not take the force out of the blow, nor diminish the impact it has had, and will continue have, on us – as people and as a band.”Furuholmen stressed the band’s compassion for Harket and his family and expressed gratitude for their memories, fandom and legacy.A-ha formed in Oslo in 1982, comprised of guitarist Paul Waaktaar-Savoy, keyboardist Furuholmen and lead singer Harket. The band has had nine Top 10 UK singles including Take on Me and You Are the One.Harket gave concerned fans a message about how to take the news: “Don’t worry about me. Find out who you want to be – a process that can be new each and every day. Be good servants of nature, the very basis of our existence, and care for the environment while it is still possible to do so. Spend your energy and effort addressing real problems, and know that I am being taken care of.”Explore more on these topicsA-haPop and rockNorwayParkinson's diseasenewsShareReuse this content"

It featured the testimony of several women who claim they were sexually assaulted by Simmons in the 1980s and 90s, when he was at the height of his influence as the co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, the hip-hop label behind LL Cool J,Public Enemy, the Beastie Boys and other top acts.Simmons has consistently denied all allegations. He seeks $20m for defamation, alleging the film-makers “disregard[ed] and/or suppressed” information provided by his representatives, according to a summons filed in Manhattan court on Tuesday by Simmons’ lawyer, Imran Ansari.‘People continue to turn a blind eye’: behind a shocking film about music industry abuseRead more“Despite voluminous support for Mr Simmons in the form of credible information, persuasive evidence, witness statements, and calls for further investigation by notable members of the media, politics, and the civil rights movement, the defendants simply disregarded it, and released, and continue to re-release globally, a film that tremendously disparaged and damaged Mr Simmons with salacious and defamatory accusations that he vehemently denies,” Ansari and co-counsel Carla DiMare said in a statement.The suit comes after the statute of limitations for defamation in New York passed, which is one year from the date of first publication. To prevail, Simmons and his legal team will have to demonstrate thatHBOis liable for “republication” in international markets.On Wednesday, HBO’s parent company, Warner Bros Discovery, dismissed the lawsuit’s allegations as “unfounded”.“We dispute Mr Simmons’ allegations, stand by the film-makers and their process, and will vigorously defend ourselves against these unfounded allegations,” a company spokesperson toldDeadline.On the Record premiered to strong reviews at the Sundance film festival in January 2020. The film was initially supposed to stream on Apple TV+ as part of producer Oprah Winfrey’s deal with the company, but ended up at HBO Max that May after Winfrey abruptly withdrew her support ahead of the film’s premiere, citing unspecified “inconsistencies”. (Though no longer affiliated with the film, Winfrey continued to publicly support its subjects – “I stand with the women, I support the women, and I do hope that people see the film,” shetold CBSthat January.)On the Record: the music industry #MeToo doc that caused Oprah to turn awayRead moreWinfrey’s shock withdrawal from the project “blinded” the film-makers, who maintained that she was incorrect. “There are no inconsistencies,” Dicktoldthe Guardian in May 2020. “These stories were reported by the New York Times, the LA Times and the Hollywood Reporter and very extensively vetted.”According to Simmons’ filing, he and his lawyers unsuccessfully lobbied HBO leaders at the time to stop distribution of the film with unspecified contradictory evidence. “Defendants were requested to review this evidence and information by multiple luminaries in media and politics, including but not limited to, civil rights leaders and members of Congress, and other high-profile black leaders; and board members within the defendant corporation(s) itself,” the filing states.Simmons is one of several high-profile music figures, including fellow producerSean “Diddy” Combsand R&B singerChris Brown, to face multiple lawsuits for sexual misconduct, including from women who appeared in On the Record. He has also followed their footsteps in suing the distributors of documentaries detailing the allegations. Brown claimed defamation in a$500m suitagainst Warner Bros Discovery for releasing the 2024 documentaryChris Brown: A History of Violence, filed this past January. Diddy, who is currently on trial in New York for racketeering and sex trafficking, sued NBC Universal and its streaming service Peacock in February for Diddy: The Making of a Bad Boy, a 90-minute film on the allegations of sexual abuse made in more than three dozen lawsuits.Simmons wasmost recently suedin February 2024 by an anonymous former executive at Def Jam Recording, for an alleged rape in the 1990s and sexual harassment that “disrupted and derailed” her career. In 2023, he reached a confidential settlement with three women, including documentary participant Sil Lai Abrams, who alleged in the film that Simmons raped her in 1994.In all, more than 20 women have accused Simmons of sexual assault. Ansari, his lawyer, works for Aidala, Bertuna & Kamins, a New York-based law firm that is currently representingHarvey Weinsteinin his criminal trial for sexual assault and misconduct. Simmons seeks “immediate removal” of the documentary from HBO’s platforms and $20m in damages.Explore more on these topicsRussell SimmonsDocumentary filmsHBORape and sexual assaultUS television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It’s divide and conquer.”Hegseth orders US navy to strip Harvey Milk name from ship amid Pride monthRead morePenn, who won his second best actor Oscar for playing the former San Francisco supervisor, added in an email: “I’ve never before seen a Secretary of Defense so aggressively demote himself to the rank of Chief PETTY Officer.”The order to rename the USNS HarveyMilk, christened in San Diego in 2021 for the prominent gay rights and navy veteran, was part of an internal memo that was leaked on Tuesday. The Pentagon’s chief spokesperson confirmed that the ship’s new name “will be announced after internal reviews are complete”.The timing of the decision for mid-June, a month meant to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community, was reportedly intentional. The renaming is supposed to ensure “alignment with president and SECDEF objectives and SECNAV priorities of reestablishing the warrior culture”, referring to Donald Trump, Hegseth and navy secretary John Phelan, according to the memorandum.“Secretary Hegseth is committed to ensuring that the names attached to all DOD installations and assets are reflective of the commander in chief’s priorities, our nation’s history and the warrior ethos,” the Pentagon said in a statement.LGBTQ+ leaders condemn Trump plan to drop Harvey Milk’s name from navy shipRead more“These guys are idiots,” Black told the Hollywood Reporter. “Pete Hegseth does not seem like a smart man, a wise man, a knowledgeable man. He seems small and petty. I would love to introduce him to some LGBTQ folks who are warriors who have had to be warriors our entire life just to live our lives openly as who we are.”Milk, written by Black and directed by Gus Van Sant, depicted Milk’s political ascendancy in San Francisco, where he became the first publicly gay man to be elected to public office when he won a seat on the city’s board of supervisors. He was assassinated along with mayor George Moscone by former city supervisor Dan White in 1978. White was convicted on two counts of voluntary manslaughter and served just five years in prison.The USNS Harvey Milk was initially named in 2016 during the administration ofBarack Obama. According to the leaked memo, Phelan is also considering new titles for vessels named after such civil rights icons as Thurgood Marshall, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Harriet Tubman and Cesar Chavez.“Harvey Milk is an icon, a civil rights icon, and for good reason,” Black said. “That’s not going to change. Renaming a ship isn’t going to change that. If people are pissed off, good, be pissed off – but take the appropriate action. Do what Harvey Milk had said we need to do, and it’s about bringing back together the coalition of the ‘us’-es that helps move the pendulum of progress forward.

The ambient sounds of the city served as a soundtrack for the silent films. Several videos played simultaneously on different sections of the 360-degree projection wrapped around the building’s exterior. Titled the Philadelphians, the 10 portraits recognize the contributions of the city’simmigrantcommunities.One film profiled an Afghan immigrant named Rezwan Natiq and followed him as he shopped at a halal Middle Eastern food market. His words were displayed on the screen: “I had a lot of mixed feelings but I had no other option than to leave Afghanistan. I was thinking about my parents who stayed behind, and on the other hand, I was happy that my kids would get to live the life they deserve. At least they will be safe here.” He then shared that he felt compelled to give back to the local immigrant community after receiving the opportunity for a new life in the US.Toward the end of the three-minute film, the words “father”, “sweetheart” and “healthcare professional” flashed over a montage of Natiq at the store and then smiling as he stood in front of City Hall. The Dari translation appeared at the bottom.View image in fullscreenRezwan Natiq in one of the short film portraits.Photograph: Nadia Hironaka and Matthew Suib.Philadelphia-based artist duo Nadia Hironaka and Matthew Suib began filming the portraits in the spring of 2024. In collaboration with the city’s Office of Immigrant Affairs (OIA), they sought to highlight the immigrant communities that have always existed in one of the oldest cities in the nation. Commissioned by Forman Arts Initiative and Mural ArtsPhiladelphia, the project is the result of the art non-profits’ second annual residency program where artists observed a city department. “Public art projects like The Philadelphians bring communities together and highlight how we are more alike than we are diﬀerent,” Alain Joinville, the director of strategic communications and programs for the OIA said in a statement. “They are a vehicle for joy, introspection, and love.”For Hironaka and Suib, a public artwork that recognizes the contributions of immigrants to the cultural fabric of the city may be more important now than ever. It was not meant as an overtly political project, said Suib, but as a response to negative rhetoric about immigration.In recent months, the Trump administration has taken aim at sanctuary cities including Philadelphia, that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. In April, Donald Trumpsigned an executive ordervowing to crack down on such jurisdictions. In May, Philadelphia was named on a homeland security list of hundreds of cities, states and counties at risk of losing federal funding for what the Trump administration considered obstructing immigration laws. The list was taken down a few days later, but it still encouraged Cherelle L Parker, Philadelphia’s mayor, to shirk the sanctuary label. Parker’s administration announced that Philadelphia would becalleda welcoming city, though its immigration policies remain the same.“Our focus is very much upon the intent of bringing people together, talking about shared experiences and voices and emotions and values that we have with all the immigrant communities that are here,” Hironaka told the Guardian. “You really see all of us as Philadelphians.”The film will run until 8 June 2025, and it will be accessible online at theMural Arts PhiladelphiaandForman Arts Initiativewebsites afterwards.View image in fullscreenThe Philadelphians is a public art projection and city-wide project celebrating the city’s vibrant immigrant communities, past and present.Photograph: Gustavo Garcia, Colibrí WorkshopWhen the artist duo learned that their residency would be based in the Office of Immigrant Affairs, which assists immigrants in resettling and accessing city services, Suib said “one of our most important cues from the office was thinking about people, not in terms of their status, but who lives in the city, who are our neighbors. They are invested in making sure that people who arrive in Philly from anywhere in the world are welcome.” Hironaka and Suib talked to everyone in the office, many of whom were immigrants themselves.The featured participants were immigrants or descendants of immigrants from Eritrea, Ukraine, China, Jamaica, Italy, Afghanistan, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Sweden and Mexico. The films are not meant to include every immigrant community in the city, Suib said, but to highlight the community leaders and “everyday people who are just making everyday contributions to better the city through the work that they do”.The artist duo filmed the participants using 16mm film and video at their homes, workplaces, grocery stores and places of worship. To flip “the narrative about immigrant labor to the idea of creating culture”, Suib said, they also filmed cultural craftmaking projects – such as batik, a textile dyeing technique from Asia, beadwork made by north Africans during Ramadan, and traditional African embroidery.In the future, Hironaka and Suib hope that their project encourages other cities to engage with their diverse composite of neighbors. “It would be really nice to be a model for other cities to take on,” said Hironaka, “to conduct a similar project and reach out and connect with different immigrant communities in their cities and spaces.”Toward the end of the Friday evening viewing, archival footage of a traditional European celebration in Philadelphia was intercut with modern-day footage of people crafting with blue beads.The viewer was then transported to St James Church in Philadelphia, where Barbara Wilson, an immigrant from Jamaica, sat in a pew. She struggled to find a place to worship when she arrived in Philadelphia and decided to attend the church because it reminded her of one in her home country. “When someone leaves their country and comes to a new country, a country of opportunities, they want to excel,” her words appeared on the screen. “They come to help build the country and in doing so, build themselves.”Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphiaUS immigrationArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is a clear need to reform Access to Work, but this must be based on constructively supporting disabled people into meaningful work, not a cost-cutting exercise.”Access to Work is designed to help people with disabilities or adverse health conditions get back into work or remain in employment.Companies and employees can apply for grants via the scheme to assist disabled people in the workplace, and can provide support beyond the “reasonable adjustments” an employer is required to make by law. It is designed to prevent employers from discriminating against those who could require expensive workplace accommodations.The comedian and disability rights campaigner Jess Thom recently told ofher “despair”at being informed her Access to Work paymentwas being cut by 61%.Tom Ryalls, one of the organisers of the open letter, told the Guardian it was the fact “Jess was no longer able to do her job” and the current green paper consultation that triggered the letter’s release. “There’s the consultation but this is also about unspoken cuts that are already happening,” he said.Almost15% of the workforce in the creative industries are disabled, compared with about 23% in the general workforce. In organisations funded by Arts Council England, this figurefalls to about 9%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A star-crossed romance about London-dwelling young adults Raj and Simran, the three-hour epic explored the lives of a new generation of diaspora Indians born abroad and navigating changing family values.Thirty years on and DDLJ has become one of the highest grossing Bollywood movies of all time, still screening at the Maratha Mandir cinema in Mumbai. For the many fans used to singing along to its songs on wedding dancefloors, director Aditya Chopra’s stage adaptation will come as a surprise.With new music from Bollywood production duo Vishal-Shekhar and an updated story by Mean Girls co-writer Nell Benjamin, Come Fall in Love supplants Punjabi boy Raj with all-English “Rog” (Roger) to produce a multiracial take on the diaspora tale.View image in fullscreenStar-crossed romance … Rog (Ashley Day) and Simran (Jen Pandya) in Come Fall in Love.Photograph: Johan PerssonThe racial dynamics and narrative beats are broad-brushstroke. Billionaire progeny Roger (Ashley Day) is the son of divorced parents and doesn’t believe in lasting love, while straight-A student Simran (Jena Pandya) is a second-generation immigrant striving for an immaculate romance while promised to a family friend in Punjab. The pair are an unlikely couple, until they find themselves Interrailing around Europe and sparks fly.So far, so predictable. Yet, Day and Pandya have an undeniable chemistry, flitting around one another with nimble coyness and furtive passion, leaving the audience rooting for their inevitable love. Rob Ashford and Shruti Merchant’s choreography is equally engrossing, making full use of the ensemble cast to dart around and leap over Derek McLane’s intricate set, while standout solo performances come from Kinshuk Sen as clowning fiancee Kuljit and Kara Lane as Rog’s mother, Minky, in the raucous number Hot and Independent and Hot.Vishal-Shekhar’s bhangra, reggae and disco music may not reach the melodramatic peaks of the original film’s yearning melodies but closing number Holi Hai is infectiously celebratory, leaving the audience on their feet. It is testament to the fact that while Come Fall in Love isn’t the most nuanced or complex investigation of diaspora identity, it is joyously loud and kitsch, expertly embodying the tenets of the Bollywood art form.AtManchester Opera Houseuntil 21 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsBollywoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

She doesn’t wear a tutu to fill goons with lead thoughPeter BradshawWed 4 Jun 2025 18.00 EDTShareThat title could cause confusion. The film might accidentally tap into the Frozen customer-base, and millions of wide-eyed little girls in sparkly tutus and tiaras will show up at cinemas with their mums and dads to watch Keanu Reeves let a heavy-set gangster have it in the chops with a round from his specially customised Glock. Well, the confusion is deliberate. Here, the delicacy of ballet and the violence of martial arts are conflated. In this new spin-off feature from Keanu’s John Wick action franchise – an auxiliary episode on the timeline, between Wick episodes Three andFour, when JW was lying low, recovering from injuries – a mysterious new action-slash-classical-dance heroine called Eve now grands-jetés her way into the franchise, played by the always stylish Ana de Armas. JW veteran Shay Hatten writes the screenplay and Len Wiseman directs.The central idea returns me an old maxim of mine: people who call action scenes in films “balletic” have never seen a ballet, or indeed a fight, in their lives. Yet I was sort of hoping that de Armas’s ballerina Eve Macarro would put the smackdown on a couple of dozen goons while up on pointe. Sadly no. But I do have to admit that de Armas carries off the essential silliness of Ballerina and, after her performance as Paloma in No Time to Die opposite Daniel Craig’s 007, she proves again she can do action, in both couture and daytime wear; she can also carry out the time-honoured lightning-fast choreography of removing a clip from an automatic weapon, inspecting its contents, smacking it back into position with the heel of her palm and then filling someone full of lead.Eve is inducted into the way of violence as a little kid, like Natalie Portman’s badass moppet in Luc Besson’s Léon, or indeed like John Wick himself; she is secretly trained in weaponry and martial arts at the same time as she is schooled in ballet, the rigour and discipline of which are considered to be complementary to those of beating the jeepers out of someone. It happened after her dad was whacked by a mysterious cult led by a dead-eyed creep called the Chancellor (Gabriel Byrne), and the plucky orphan is taken in by the Ruska Roma group led by Anjelica Huston’s implacable Director, and grows to womanhood in this strange, dysfunctional ballet-plus-violence organisation whose income apparently derives from assassination fees. But Eve has always nursed a desire for revenge against the weird tribe who killed her dad.FourJohn Wickfilms with Keanu fetishising his guns and sporting his increasingly werewolfy facial hair have been increasingly heavy going but now de Armas mixes things up and she is a smart screen presence. As for the ballet, the emphasis is on Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake; nothing wrong with that, of course, but if the Ballerina sub-franchise continues, let’s hope that different works are chosen and we see de Armas actually getting out there on stage in a tutu as opposed to simply racking up the kills.Ballerina is out on 6 June in Australia and the US, and on 7 June in the UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersAction and adventure filmsAna de ArmasAnjelica HustonGabriel ByrneIan McShanereviewsShareReuse this content"

The affirmation came at the start of a poem by Arthur Berry, written in 1986 to toast the new theatre and welcome audiences to a place of “necessary illusions”. In his native Potteries, Berry is a celebrated polymath, known for his drawings, prints and watercolours, as well as poetry, broadcasting and half a dozen plays, including St George of Scotia Road, the theatre’s opening production.Appropriately, in thiscentenary year of Berry’s birthand three decades after his death, the theatre has dug out the first draft of his final play, spruced it up and given it a belated debut.It is unlikely anyone would consider Whatever Happened to Phoebe Salt a neglected classic. Drawn with the same broad strokes and warm human eye as the sketches that line the upper foyer walls, it is a kitchen-sink drama, evoking the long-lost life of working-class Card Street, Burslem, where the pulse of a pugmill sets a relentless rhythm and the wafer-thin walls permit no secrets.Berry writes with a sense of bittersweet nostalgia: think Terence Davies’sDistant Voices, Still Liveswith the intensity, violence and poetry dialled down. His characters are trapped by circumstance, their lives made smaller by the need to survive.There is Nellie Salt (Laura Costello), washed out and broken, her hopes of betterment dashed by teenage pregnancy. There is her husband, Sammy (Alasdair Baker), gruff and taciturn, his emotions reserved for the care of his pregnant sow he keeps. And above all, there is Phoebe Salt (Isabella Rossi), the “daughter of the sun” and the only colour in Lis Evans’s perfectly drab 1950s set, a young woman bursting with an energy that cannot be contained.Making a debut as assured as it is bolshie, Rossi has the measure of this ever-restless teenager, bored by her faithful fiance (Elliot Goodhill), enticed by the illicit thrill of her married boss (Perry Moore), entertained by the showbiz ambitions of her stage partner (Andrew Pollard), and worth more than all of them put together. In Abbey Wright’s well acted production, she rides above the perfunctory plot and heavily signalled denouement and makes it her own.AtNew Vic, Newcastle-under-Lyme, until 21 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

But this production shows his late work contains genuine warmth – and love – beneath the disappointments and dishonesties of married life.Longsuffering wife Lydia (Claire Price) seems stranded in her marriage to the pompous and hectoring Sebastian (Dominic Rowan) who – quite literally – cannot change a lightbulb without her assistance. When they are visited by successful American writer Mark (Daniel Abelson), who has always loved Lydia, the plot seems to promise a love triangle.But this play, written as part of a double bill in 1973, wrongfoots those expectations. It veers in several directions, from serious illness and impending death to father-son wrangles between Sebastian and Joey (Joe Edgar), who is an aspiring TV writer. Thrown into the mix is Lydia’s “outsider” status (she is Estonian) with talk of refugees as outsiders to “Englishness” along with the lived memories of the Holocaust, as well as political debates that set Sebastian’s champagne Marxism against Joey’s embrace of the Liberal party.The play was said to be loosely inspired by Rex Harrison and his last (sixth) wife, Kay Kendall, who died two years after they were married, in 1959.View image in fullscreenSimmering tension … Dominic Rowan and Daniel Abelson.Photograph: Ellie KurttzThe play creaks with female sacrifice that feels peculiarly of its time: Lydia lives in service to Sebastian, tending to his every need. And even when she suspects him of an affair, she still plans for his future welfare. Directed by Amelia Sears, the production does not try to disguise the datedness. This is a 1970s world of tiny black and white TV sets, drinks cabinets and dutiful wives.Staged fouryears before Rattigan died in 1977, it deals with impending death, but also the characteristic peering under the bonnet of a couple’s secrets; Lydia with her illness, Sebastian with an off-stage female lover who might well be the coded homosexual partner often found in Rattigan’s work.There is nervy humour and Price gives a delicate performance as Lydia, capturing the psychological subtleties of her part, while Rowan is sufficiently sledge-hammer as her boorish husband. Still, it is not as monumental a play asThe Deep Blue Sea, also about the disenchantments of romance, nor is it as chamber-like as some of Rattigan’s double-bills (such asSummer 1954). The parts of Joey and Mark feel like cogs to the plot, which itself is so busy that it dilutes emotional focus.But it is a tender work that leaves you with the picture of a family, fractious certainly, but loving too in their own way – and together until the end. Like so many Rattigan marriages, there are secrets and lies here but underneath there is a love that smoulders.AtOrange Tree theatre, London, until 5 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatreOrange Tree theatreTerence RattiganreviewsShareReuse this content"

Take the opening, where she appears in pale rose dress, partner José Maldonado in dusky pink, and they circle each other, eyes locked, not predatory but sweet, coquettish and companionable, and all attention is quietly drawn to them.That’s no disrespect to the musicians – a simple set-up with singer David Lagos, guitarist Santiago Lara and palmas (hand claps) provided by twins Antonio and Manuel Montes Saavedra. It’s only that Ruiz’s show is the antidote to the full-volume, all-feet-firing, tearing-one’s-heart-out onslaught of much virtuoso flamenco.Ruiz appears as part of London’s annual Flamenco festival, which features a wide range of musicians and dancers, some pushing the art form in unexpected directions, others keeping a more traditional flame aglow. Ruiz, who has been leading her own company for 22 years, is more in the latter camp, dressed in demure version of classic flamenco style: the long ruffled bata de cola skirt, the mantón shawl, Cordobés hat, fan and castanets.She is, as it happens, a demon on those castanets (same when it comes to finger clicks). Sometimes she holds them behind her back, we hear their twittering out of sight, and it’s like her thoughts whirring, a little subtext to the relationship we see on stage – although this doesn’t feel like a deeply subtextual work. It’s an ode to the art, which Ruiz has absorbed deeply and returns to us with a light touch, hands like fine lace, smile like warm sun. There’s a gentleness to Ruiz’s petal-soft movement, it is playful and delicate and precise. Meanwhile, the gentlemanly Maldonado supports, enhances, but doesn’t try to upstage Ruiz. It’s wonderful to hear the subtleties in his footwork, the conversational tones and controlled dynamic, accented with a well-placed sforzando in agreement with the climax of a musical phrase.Romancero del Baile Flamenco may seem a little tame in comparison with some of the festival’s other offerings, the starry bravura of Sara Baras, the progressive politics ofManuel Liñanor duoEstévez/Paños’s experimentation with form but there is absolutely a place for a class act like Ruiz, even if this outing doesn’t thoroughly enthral.Flamenco festival continues until 8 JuneExplore more on these topicsDanceFlamencoSadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s pleasant, feelgood TVLucy ManganWed 4 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 4 Jun 2025 11.30 EDTShareI’ve never met a golfer in real life. I’ve always assumed I’m the wrong demographic – perhaps in terms of age, or class or at least tax bracket – or perhaps my lack of athleticism is so aggressive that it has prevented me from becoming friends with anyone with even the mildest sporting proclivity for all my life. Instead, I have essentially taken Mark Twain’s word for it that golf is a good walk spoiled, and gone about my days.Now, however, I think golf may be the spoiler of a good new comedy drama. Stick, it’s called – a deadening name – and it starsOwen Wilsonas washed-up golf pro Pryce Cahill. He had a televised meltdown during a tournament at the peak of his career (“He triple-bogeyed his entire life”) and is now reduced to selling golf kit, giving lessons to rich old ladies and hustling for cash in bars. He is also going through a divorce, and still living in the former marital home that his wife Amber-Linn (Judy Greer) – with whom he is still on good terms, bound as they are by a shared sorrow – now wants them to sell.View image in fullscreenHustle partners … Marc Maron and Owen Wilson in Stick.Photograph: Justine Yeung/APWhen our hero (undeniably charming and eminently watchable, given Wilson’s talents, which are always more subtle than you remember) comes across a teenager, Santi (Peter Dager, a lovely mix of adolescent cockiness, fragility and insubordination), sneaking into the club to hit shots every day, Pryce realises Santi is a prodigy and that he may be able to make something of him. And – who knows? – maybe something of himself again at the same time.All Pryce has to do is persuade Santi’s mother Elena (Mariana Treviño) to let him take Santi on a road trip to half a dozen tournaments so he might qualify for the US amateur championships, and talk his best friend and hustle partner Mitts (Marc Maron) into driving the RV. Elena demands $100,000 and she’s coming with them, while Mitts gives in without requiring payment. Pryce agrees to let Amber-Linn buy him out of the house for the required sum and, after a few minor hiccups, we are off to the races – or at least the golf tournaments.It’s not really about the golf, of course, any more than Ted Lasso – whose success Apple is clearly trying to replicate here – was about football. Santi has been emotionally damaged by his now absent father, and Pryce has his triple-bogeyed life to remake. Through the magic of sporting metaphors, gradually improving communications skills and the transformation of the motley crew (to whom is added a sacked young bartender called Zero, played by Lilli Kay) into a loving found family, there is every sign that wounds will be healed and fame and fortune secured for all.All you need, really, is to take Pryce’s “Grossweiner” story to heart: all you can control is your swing, in the moment. Do your best then and there. What happens to the ball after that is out of your hands. But this is the kind of thing I am most allergic to, because what happens to the ball after that is entirely the product of what you have achieved up to then – just like in life, and the exact opposite of the lesson Pryce is purportedly teaching. Go stand in a bunker and think about things again.Owen Wilson’s 20 best performances – ranked!Read moreLook, Stick is fine. It’s a pleasant, feelgood half hour every time. It never outstays its welcome, everyone puts in a solid performance and Wilson brings every ounce of energy he has to every scene he’s in. But nothing takes off, never mind soars. Ted Lasso had jokes while Stick trades in mildly humorous lines. Ted had the American versus British, fish-out-of-water thing going on; Stick lacks that secondary motor. And Ted had football. Stick has golf. One of which sports has familiarity, arouses widespread passion in the real world and is inherently televisual. The other, no matter how much you do with drones and other inventive shots, has none of these advantages. It’s another drag on a vehicle that isn’t quite as streamlined as it should be in the first place.Stick is on Apple TV+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewOwen WilsonTV comedyDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

It is the softcore erotic drama from screenwriter Joe Eszterhas and director Paul Verhoeven that has made a slow ascent from critical flop to kitsch cult favourite and now to a supposed tongue-out-of-cheek classic melodrama. Maybe it’s the last great mainstream exploitation picture, a film which owns and flaunts its crassness; a bi-curious catfight version of All About Eve or Pretty Woman.Elizabeth Berkley plays Nomi, a mysterious, beautiful, super-sexy drifter who arrives in Vegas, hoping to make it dancing in one of the hotel shows. She is befriended by Molly (Gina Ravera), a good-natured pal whose help gets Nomi a start in a low-grade strip joint called Cheetah’s. Nomi soon upgrades to the supposedly classier Stardust where she is dazzled by the gorgeousness of leading lady Cristal Connors, played by Gina Gershon with an entirely ridiculous way of addressing everyone as “darlin’” in a Texas accent. Nomi has a sexual frisson with the club’s owner Zack, played byKyle MacLachlan(whose presence helps give the film a mild and accidental Lynchian flavour) and also with Cristal herself, whose understudy she aspires to be. Throughout it all, Nomi shows she is a survivor with a streak of ruthlessness.The question has to be asked. Why? Why? Why the strange, clenched, maniacal acting and directing, which Verhoeven never actually demonstrated before or ever again, and which really doesn’t resemble any other 90s erotic thriller. It looks more like an erotic horror with the horror removed. Berkley’s baffling performance, abruptly switching back and forth between sultry pouting and pop-eyed badass defiance, is that of a Stepford sexbot; though it has to be said it is managed, like the rest of the film, with a fanatically focused consistency and Berkley’s onscreen appearance is impressive, even awe-inspiring in her trance-like beauty.Everything is deeply strange: the angular, jolting choreography, the persistent, repeated and pedantic revelation of naked breasts, and the grotesque treatment of ageing stripper Mama Bazoom, played by Lin Tucci, who is portrayed with absolute misogyny, though arguably no more so than anyone or anything else. Then there is the rape scene, which is not really redeemed by the rape-revenge scene.There is one tiny touch which gives Showgirls a kind of human dimension: poor out-of-towner Nomi buys herself a fancy gown and mispronounces the word “Versace” as “Ver-sayss” and is mocked by the sneery Vegas insiders (although Zack rather gallantly glosses over it). That whole moment seems to come from another film entirely. Are we rushing to clothe the naked emperor by contriving emollient or contrarian explanations for all this? Perhaps. (The hip young cinephiles inMia Hansen-Løve’s 2014 film Edenare shown debating whether the awfulness of Showgirls is deliberate.) It remains weirdly innocent in its absurdity.Showgirls is in UK and Irish cinemas from 6 June, and is streaming in Australia on SBS On Demand.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsLas VegasKyle MacLachlanreviewsShareReuse this content"

I was at junior school. I had a friend whose mother was described as “vague” – this was the 1970s, so that could have been code for almost anything. The vague mother had given my normally quite organised mother directions to a remote house where my schoolfriend spent his summers. We were “popping in” (70s code: spending the day there). The instructions to find the place were something like, “Turn left after South Zeal, pass the dirt track and follow the direction the sheep are facing.”After an hour of pretending we were still on the right route, my mum suddenly burst into tears and uttered a rare denunciation of a fellow human being. “That SILLY woman!” she shouted. “We don’t know where we are. Nobody does.”Were we not just lost, but lost-lost, in the way that leads to humans sometimes disappearing for ever? “Nobody does” sounded serious to this 10-year-old. There were no mobile phones and, this being the olden days, only a large spiral-bound map of the entire country in the footwell of the car (at this stage, a gen Z reader will be saying: “Nah. That never happened”). We were, I suspect, on Dartmoor.View image in fullscreenJeremy Vine on the beach with his daughters Martha, left, and Anna, when they were youngMy mum pulled herself together and eventually the tears were dried, new purpose found, her boy reassured, the house somehow located. But for many years the word “Devon” was synonymous in my mind with “lost and weeping”. It was not a place you go to by choice. Nobody does.But 25 years later I did return. In a sense there was no choice; the location came with my lovely fiancee Rachel Schofield. Her parents had retired to a sprawling house near Sidmouth. It had a cobwebbed pantry and service bells for long-dead maids. They suggested a marquee in their back garden on the wedding day. I was hardly about to reply: “Have you thought of Hammersmith?”Not lost, this time, but found. We were married in the church of St John the Evangelist in Tipton St John. My mum cried again, but for different reasons. Over the years we came down summer after summer, Christmas after Christmas, for R&R in the muddy Devon air. Our two kids arrived. It became their go-to bucket-and-spade location: I recently heard a psychologist explain how a regular family holiday location is “good for children’s mental health”, and wondered why she never mentioned adults.View image in fullscreenThe Jurassic coast at Branscombe.Photograph: MH Coast/AlamyThere are some great spots around that part of the east Devon coast. You can see the full glory of the Jurassic Coast in Seaton, and gasp at the fact that Jurassic means “ 200m years ago”. There are almost-private beaches too (just don’t picnic in the shade of the rock face – I never trust a bit above me not to break off and I don’t want to be killed by the Mesozoic era). You can go to arcades in Exmouth, not quite Jurassic but still wonderfully old-fashioned. Play the penny falls and the impossible lucky dip. Or visit the“Excape” roomthere, set up and run by the most lovely young couple you will ever meet.At Branscombe beach you can see the place where, in 2007, the so-called “scavengers of Branscombe” descended. A freighter shed its cargo, the goods were washed on to the normally deserted beach, and about £1m-worth of cars, motorbikes, spare parts, bric-a-brac and countless items of treasure trove were liberated by people who came from all over the country. Newspapers called it the “Branscombe beach booty bonanza”.Sidmouth is chintzy in places, drab in others, but it feels real. And real by the sea is a different kind of beautyThere I go again, letting my news head take over. Devon is a place to leave the real world behind. Walk from Axmouth to Lyme Regis if you want the coastal path. Go to Budleigh Salterton if you love a cliff and you don’t mind pebbles (use sea shoes and a wetsuit, and suddenly you have Bondi beach in Budleigh). Go to the village of Beer forPecoramaif you have young ones; their model railway takes humans. Ottery St Mary hasWildwoodwildlife park and its drop slide, the most inspiring challenge to health and safety law I’ve seen this century. If you want pure walking,Newton Poppleford to Budleigh Saltertonis six miles.Seaton Wetlandshas three miles of trails. Or just walk in a circle round Colyton.But it’s Sidmouth I come back to. After getting married close by, it became our summer place. It has sights such asJacob’s Ladderhistoric wooden steps, the supersize-me cakes at theClock Tower cafeor the famousDonkey Sanctuary, probably one of the most popular charities on the face of the Earth. It’s not a classic sandy beach – a single triangle of brown sand is revealed at low tide, and that’s your lot – but you feel you’re facing proper sea, with heavy weather triggering waves that crash against rocks by the promenade. When I set my first whodunnit, Murder on Line One,in the town, I included a scene in chapter two where a massive wave sweeps the radio station manager and her just-sacked DJ into the water together. He has to rescue her, fishing her out of the sea after she kicked him out of his job.View image in fullscreenJeremy Vine and his daughtersWhat I love most about Sidmouth is that it feels like a town going places. It was once cruelly nicknamed “God’s waiting room”. But recently Radio 2 had to cover a story about a giant lump of congealed fat, wet wipes and dental floss that had blocked the sewers. “It is the size,” we were told, “of two doubledecker buses.” It was sucked out using some sort of reverse fire hose. Others despaired, but I felt this was Sidmouth laying down a marker. It had a bigger blob of fat than Blackpool. More families, more jobs, more going on (and going down). It’s chintzy in places, drab in others, but it feels real. And real by the sea is a different kind of beauty. Brits need proximity to the ocean. In Sidmouth you’re virtually in it.Jeremy Vine’s debutmystery, Murder on Line One (HarperCollins, £20), is out now.To support the Guardian order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Think the comforting familiarity of terrine and steak tartare, of onion soup and moules-frîtes, the sheer pleasure that is a properParis-Brestor tarte tatin … In my home town of Lyon, we’ve even developed our own local take on the bistro in the form of thebouchon, to showcase and preserve the region’s culinary traditions. Bistro, bouchon, brasserie: whatever you call it, this is, above all else, good, honest cooking, rustic rather than show-offy, and it’s made to share around a noisy table, whether that’s in a restaurant or in the comfort of your own home.Lamb shoulder with flageolet beans (pictured top)Yes, there’s a fair amount of soaking, curing and marinading going on here, but it’s all well worth the effort – plus none of it requires much in the way of actual hands-on work, anyway.Prep20 minSoak24 hrCure6 hrMarinate12 hrCook5 hr 30 min+Serves4For the lamb1.2-1½kg bone-in lamb shoulder100g table salt1-1½ tsprosemary leaves1-1½ tspthyme leaves1 tsp finely chopped garlicVegetable oil, for searing4 cloves new season garlic, peeled, cut in half and germs removedAbout 1 litre lamb stockFor the marinade50ml extra-virgin olive oil½ tsp espelette pepper½ tsp paprika50ml vegetable oilFor the beans250g dried flageolet beans50g finely chopped shallot(about 6 tbsp)50g finely chopped celery(about 3-4 tbsp)10g finely chopped garlic(about 2 cloves)8-10bay leaves(5g)2-3 tsp thyme leaves(5g)1 litrechicken stockSaltSoak the dried beans in cold water for 24 hours. Meanwhile, put the lamb shoulder in a suitable dish in which it fits snugly, rub all over with the salt, rosemary, thyme and chopped garlic, then cover, refrigerate and leave to cure for six hours.Wash the cured lamb, then dry well with a clean tea towel or kitchen cloth. Heat a little vegetable oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan or casserole, then sear the lamb shoulder until well coloured all over. Make eight deep cuts all over the seared lamb and push the halved new-season garlic cloves into the slits. Put the lamb back in the same dish, add all the ingredients for the marinade, toss to coat, then cover again, return to the fridge and leave to marinate for 12 hours.Put the lamb and all its marinade in a large, cast-iron pot for which you have a lid, then pour in enough lamb stock to come halfway up the sides of the meat. Cover the pot and roast in a very low oven – 140C (120C fan)/300F/gas 1 – for five to six hours, until the lamb is very tender and all but falling off the bone. Take out of the oven and turn up the heat to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Baste the lamb in the pan juices until it’s well coated, then return to the oven uncovered for another 15 minutes, basting regularly with the pan juices, until the liquid reduces and the lamb is nicely browned and glazed.After the lamb has been cooking for three to three and a half hours, drain the soaked beans and put them in an oven tray (ideally one for which you have a lid). Add the shallot, celery, garlic, bay and thyme, pour over the chicken stock, cover the tray (either with a lid or a thick double layer of foil) and bake alongside the lamb for 90 minutes. After the beans have had 45 minutes, season with salt, stir and finish off cooking. Just before serving, adjust the seasoning to taste.Spoon the cooked beans on to a big platter and top with the lamb, either carved or whole to be carved at the table. Spoon over a generous amount of the cooking juices, take to the table and serve. A few new season carrots and/or some cabbage on the side wouldn’t go amiss, either.Rum babaView image in fullscreenAt the restaurant, we make our babas in large traditionalkugelhopfmoulds, but at home you could also make individual ones in a six- or eight-hole muffin tin.Prep10 minProve1 hrCook2 hr 15 minServes10For the quick marmalade2 large oranges200g caster sugar30g lemon juiceFor the rum syrup750g caster sugar375ml dark rumFor the chantilly100ml double cream100ml whipping cream1 vanilla pod, split lengthways and seeds scraped out and reserved40g caster sugarFor the baba7g fast-action yeast, or 15g fresh yeast160g beaten egg(from about 3-4 eggs)250g strong white bread flour7g salt20g sugar50g unsalted butter, melted, plus extra softened butter for greasingFor the orange and rum glaze200g orange marmalade(see above and method)30ml dark rumFirst make the quick marmalade. Using a small, sharp knife or peeler, peel the oranges, taking care not to take off too much of the white pith, then cut the skin into fine julienne strips. Pare off and discard the pith from the oranges, then segment the orange flesh. Put the peel in a small saucepan of water, bring to a boil, then fine-strain. Return the peel to the pan, cover with fresh water and repeat the process twice more. After the third strain, put the orange peel back in the pan, add the orange segments, sugar and 420ml cold water, and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer, and leave to cook for about 45 minutes, until thick, sticky and jammy. Take off the heat, stir in the lemon juice and leave to cool.Now for the glaze. Once the marmalade is cool, measure 200g of the cooled marmalade into a small pan, add the rum and bring to a simmer. Strain to remove the solids, then set aside.Put all the ingredients for the chantilly cream in a clean bowl, whisk to soft peaks, then cover and refrigerate until needed.Now for the baba itself. Heat 90ml water to 28C (just above room temperature), then stir in the yeast. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment or with a hand whisk, beat the egg with the flour, salt and sugar, then beat in the yeast mixuntil well combined. Swap the whisk for the dough hook (or a wooden spoon) and mix on medium speed for five minutes, or until the dough comes together and starts to get stretchy.Slowly incorporate the melted butter, and mix until the dough is smooth.Grease a 24cm kugelhopf tin (or a six- or eight-hole muffin tin) with softened butter, scrape in the baba mix, cover with a damp cloth or clingfilm,and leave to prove at room temperature for an hour, or until it’s risen to 2cm from the top of mould. Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, then bake for about 40 minutes (or for eight to 10 minutes if making baby babas), until nicely browned and a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean.Remove from the oven, unmould at once on to a rack, then leave to cool for 10 minutes.While the baba is baking, make the syrup. Put the sugar and rum in a medium saucepan with 750ml water, bring to a simmer, then leave to cool to lukewarm (40C). Slowly pour syrup all over the baba, letting it soak in first before adding any more, until it’s fully soaked all the way through, then put on a rack to cool.Once the baba is completely cool, brush it all over with the orange and rum glaze, then slice and serve with the chantilly cream.Claude Bosi is chef/patron ofJoséphine,Brooklands at the PeninsulaandBibendum, all in London.Explore more on these topicsFrench food and drinkSummer food and drinkFoodLambMeatBeans, pulses and legumesMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

It’s often argued that it’s not really worth saving food from the waste bin if energy or other ingredients are required, but I believe that all food is worth saving.We obviously need to cook and eat food every day, so why not reinvent dishes to include these otherwise unwanted ingredients? Zero waste at its simplest can also mean basic, innovative recipes and solutions for byproducts, such as today’s mango pit and skin coulis. Such recipes are an easier sell, because they simplify the concept and create a valuable product out of very little.Mango pit and skin coulisCoulis is a thin, smooth sauce that’s usually made from sieved fruit, and this one takes the flavour and residual flesh left on mango pits and skins and turns it into a restaurant-grade fruit sauce. When I first started cooking back in the late 1990s, chefs were putting a coulis of some kind on most puddings, and some still do but, to be fair, coulis is delicious and adds another dimension to a dish. Sweet, sour and flavoursome, with a smooth and silky texture, coulis is a simple and fun way to upcycle mango scraps, and shows how it’s well worth extracting the flavour from remnants and offcuts.It also exemplifies the principles I apply when developing food products and menu items for food businesses and restaurants: that is, minimising waste through creative repurposing, maximising flavour extraction from overlooked ingredients, and creating versatile new ingredients that can be incorporated into recipes or even developed into standalone products. What works in professional kitchens and product development often translates beautifully to home cooking – and vice versa – transforming forgotten and often discarded ingredients into something of genuine culinary value.I first had the idea for this coulis while developinga recipe for mango pit vodka, and it can be drizzled, stirred or shaken into countless drinks and desserts. It’s gorgeous diluted with sparkling water, in a smoothie or iced tea, shaken into a mango mojito or spooned over pancakes, porridge or, my personal favourite, yoghurt. The scraps from one mango typically yield about 100g of coulis, and the recipe below can be scaled up for as many mango pits and skins as you have to hand.Pit and skinof 1 ripe mango50g sugar, honey or jaggeryFinely grated zest and juice of ¼ lemon or lime(optional)Put the mango pit and skin in a small saucepan and add water just to cover. Add the sugar or honey (or jaggery, for an extra-flavoursome Indian twist) and the optional lemon or lime juice and zest. Bring to a boil, stirring gently, then turn down to a simmer and cook for 15–20 minutes, until the syrup is slightly thickened and the whole kitchen smells of mangoes.Leave to cool to room temperature, then strain through a fine sieve, rubbing any flesh off the pit and skin and pressing it through the sieve to extract every last bit – the remaining pit and skin can now be composted. Return the resulting coulis to the pan, bring back to a boil and reduce until it coats the back of a spoon or reaches your desired thickness. Store in a clean jar in the fridge for about five days, or portion and freeze.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteFruitDessertSauces and graviesfeaturesShareReuse this content"
