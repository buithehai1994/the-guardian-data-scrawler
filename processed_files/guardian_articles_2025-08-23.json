And, more particularly, tech stocks making huge AI investments that have yet to make a dollar of profit.A recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology report revealed that 95% ofcompanies investing in generative AIhave yet to see any financial returns.This revelation came afterSam Altman, the boss of the ChatGPT owner OpenAI, warned that some company valuations were “insane”.Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at the currency trading firm Swissquote, said: “The [Altman] comments may have been a wake-up call for investors, sparking a sharp pullback in high-flying names.”At the beginning of the week, the share price of the data mining and spyware firmPalantir, which has billions of dollars worth of US government contracts, plunged almost 10%. The AI chip maker Nvidia fell more than 3%, while other AI-linked stocks such as Arm, Oracle and AMD also lost ground.Most pension funds will be invested in these tech companies, alongside more longstanding names such as Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google) and Meta (Facebook).Should fund managers pull out? That would probably be unwise.The scale of investment in AI by the likes of Google and Meta is vast and while the technology’s potential is the subject of much speculation, white-collar workers are becoming more familiar with the supposed benefits with every passing day.Corporate messages asking them to use AI for presentations, report writing and research are a daily occurrence (accompanied, of course, with hollow assurances that job cuts are not being considered).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His support for cryptocurrencies, including his own, and deregulated social media platforms, including his own, are indications of where his sympathies lie.AI is probably going to be bad for humanity, given that politicians and regulators are light years behind the tycoons and tech magnates backing AI, many of whom see it as a new way to disempower and dominate workers.However, as an investor, AI isn’t going away, crash or no crash.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Stock marketsTechnology sectorComputingChatGPTOpenAISam AltmancommentShareReuse this content"

The shop’s website markets a monthly human skull subscription (buyers are sent a skull of the shop’s choice each month), mummified body parts, shrunken heads, and masks and wallets made from human leather.View image in fullscreenHenry Scragg at Curiosities from the 5th Corner.Photograph: Guy Corbishley/AlamyThere is no suggestion the sale of these items is illegal, but experts, including Dame Sue Black, one of the UK’s leading forensic scientists, are calling for a crackdown on the trade in human remains.They say the lack of regulation means much of the buying and selling of skulls and bones falls into a legal grey zone; and that the growing online market risks fuelling a new era of “body snatching”, with reports of bones being removed from crypts and graveyardsin the UKandabroad.“You’ve got people who are breaking into mausolea and who are taking remains away to sell them for people who think this is gothic, quaint [or] supernatural,” said Black, the president of St John’s College, Oxford. “If you can make the sale of a bird’s nest illegal, surely to goodness you can make the sale of a human body illegal. Having a necklace made out of somebody’s teeth isn’t acceptable to people.”One problem, experts say, lies in how laws are applied. In the UK, desecrating a grave is an offence, but the remains are not technically property so they cannot legally be “owned” or “stolen”. This means it would not automatically be a crime to possess or sell historical human remains, even if they had been unlawfully exhumed.“It’s gruesome,” said Black. “It’s why we say ‘Rest in peace.’ You don’t expect your body to be dug up and sold.”Dr Trish Biers, from the department of anthropology at the University of Cambridge, coordinates a taskforce at the British Association for Biological Anthropology and Osteoarchaeology (BABAO) that investigates the sale and trade of human remains. She said there had been a substantial increase in sales in the UK in recent years. In the past five years, the BABAO had blocked more than 200 sales, including from auction houses, shops and online sellers.You can’t take photos of remains under 100 years old for medical research … but it’s OK to turn a child’s spine into a handbag handleDr Trish BiersWhile the market has long been dominated by ex-medical skulls and former museum exhibits, Biers suggested there had been an increase in the sale of skulls described as “archaeological”, the appearance of which is consistent with having been excavated from the ground or exhumed from coffins.“Social media has completely changed the market,” she said. “It’s not illegal and that’s the problem.”Similar concerns were raised in March by Mattaeus Ball, a Reading-based trader in “macabre art and oddities” who recently announced he was no longer trading in human remains.“The waters are becoming too muddy with stolen pieces, pieces that are grave-robbed, so many things that just aren’t right,” he said in an Instagram post. “And people keep thinking I’m dealing in that, when I’m not.” Ball declined to be interviewed.The Guardian showed images of 10 skulls found on sale on Instagram and other UK online forums to three forensic experts. Several were judged to be ex-anatomical teaching skulls, but others appeared to be coated with dirt or traces of human tissue, which could indicate more recent excavation.One skull, being sold for £995 on a Belfast-based website, showed signs of root damage, suggesting it had been buried in soil. One expert identified “patches of what could be darker organic matter, possible rootlets in the sutures and orbits, possible rodent gnawing”. The owner of the site said roots and rodents were not the cause of damage.Another skull, missing several teeth and marketed for £795 on the website of a UK-based shop, appeared to have manganese oxide staining, the Guardian was told, which is consistent with that seen in bodies excavated from old graves.At least three skulls showed evidence of softening, which occurs when bones are submerged in the acidic material created by decomposition inside a coffin. One of these appeared to have recent damage around the face and a dark, thin, flaky layer “which is what I have seen in skulls that have been taken from coffins”, said Black. “The white areas tell you that it is recent damage as it exposes the non-coloured bone below.”Dr Nicholas Marquez-Grant, a forensic anthropologist at Cranfield University, said that, based on anatomical features, some of the skulls probably originated from outside the UK, including Asia and Africa, and may date as far back as the 19th century.When you dig up a human skull … you could hand it to a museum. They’ve already got loads of them so they don’t need any moreHenry ScraggPaul Boateng, who will meet the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, next month to appeal for a change in the law, has raised specific concerns about the trade in remains of ancestors from Indigenous communities. “The continual trade in human beings even after death, and their continued objectification even after death, is deeply repugnant and a source of shame to our country,” he said.Most private trade in human remains falls beyond the remit of the Human Tissue Act 2004, created after the Alder Hey scandal in which children’s organs were removed and stored at the hospital without consent. The act, which enshrines legal requirements around consent, storage and use, covers only remains that are under 100 years old. It also only applies to specific uses, including organ transplants, scientific research and “public display”, which includes museums but which experts say is not routinely interpreted as applying to images shared on social media by sellers.It means that, while medical research is tightly regulated, collectors and sellers are in effect free to buy, sell and modify human remains, provided they did not acquire them illegally and are not using them for transplant.“I have to have a licence to curate remains,” Biers said. “You can’t take photos of any human remains under 100 years old if you go to Barts pathology [department]. But it’s OK to turn a child’s spine into a handbag handle. I don’t understand this.”View image in fullscreenAn item for sale at Cragg’s shop.Photograph: Guy Corbishley/Alamy“The private use of these things is in a legal void,” says Imogen Jones, a professor of law at the University of Leeds. She suggested recent cases, such as that of themortuary abuser David Fuller,showed UK law did not reflect the general expectation that dead bodies and body parts should be “treated with a baseline level of dignity respect across all sectors”.In the podcast interview, Scragg appears to acknowledge some older skulls may have been recently excavated, either to make room for new burials or by other legal means. “When you dig up a human skull, what are you going to do with it? You could hand it to a museum. They’ve already got loads of them so they don’t need any more.”Selling a skull to “people who will look after it, appreciate it, and put it on a shelf and love it”, he adds, could be viewed as “more respectful than burying it six foot under”.Other online sellers described coming into possession of bones found by construction or sewage contractors, although few gave the exact provenance. Scragg declined to comment.A spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: “All human remains should be treated with respect and dignity. We expect auction houses to scrutinise their activities and for anyone trading in human remains to consider carefully the ethical implications of this activity, which many understandably find deeply disturbing.”A DCMS source said the theft of any remains would be “an act of repugnant desecration” and that they would expect the police to act “using the full force of the law”.A spokesperson for the Human Tissue Authority said the actions of anyone undertaking activities using human tissue that fall within its regulatory remit should be guided by the principles of “consent, dignity, quality, and honesty and openness”.Explore more on these topicsArchaeologySocial mediaMedical researchRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 20 books they didn’t want you to readFrom Instagram poetry to Greek classics, the works of fiction that have caused uproar through history – and into the presentSteven PooleSat 23 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTShareThe banning of books, it would be easy to think, is a relic of less enlightened ages. The Catholic church, in a last spasm of rectitude, added Jean-Paul Sartre, Alberto Moravia and Simone de Beauvoir to its Index of Forbidden Books during the 1940s and 50s, but then abandoned the list, which had lasted four centuries, in 1966.Public book burnings by Nazis or McCarthyites, too, might be assumed to be nothing more than a baleful warning from the past. Yet the burning of books still appears an irresistible act to some – even in the country with the strongest statutory protection of free speech, the United States. In 2019,students at Georgia Southern University burned copiesof visiting Cuban-American author Jennine Capó Crucet’s Make Your Home Among Strangers, some shouting “Trump 2020!”. In 2022, the Nashville pastor Greg Lockeheld a public bonfirefor “demonic” books, including the Harry Potter and Twilight series.Censorship used to occur largely at the level of governments or other transnational authorities. It still does in authoritarian countries such as Iran and China, but western states generally liberalised in the mid-20th century. Yet a weaker form of censorship has long persisted within the American school system, where individual books are subject to “challenge” by parents who consider them inappropriate material for their children. Often, school boards will respond by removing those books from school libraries, in which case they have effectively been banned.The phenomenonhas accelerated in recent years. The machinery of school censorship in the US has also become significantly more corporate. According to the American Library Association’s analysis of its 2024 data, “the majority of book censorship attempts are now originating from organised movements. Pressure groups and government entities that include elected officials, board members and administrators initiated 72% of demands to censor books in school and public libraries.” Between 2001 and 2020, such groups challenged an average of 46 titles per year. Last year,they challenged 4,190 titles in 12 months.Donald Trump’s crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in schools and universities has led some school districts in Texas and Florida to proactively remove shelf-fulls of potential offenders within the last 12 months. Earlier this year, meanwhile, a man went into a public library in Ohio, checked out a number of books on Jewish, Black and LGBTQ+ history,and burned them all. The caption to a video of the bonfire read: “We are cleansing our libraries of degenerate filth.” Joseph Goebbels would have approved.Here, then, is a selection of other books that have been considered degenerate filth …View image in fullscreenOryx and CrakebyMargaret AtwoodAtwood’s 2003 post-apocalyptic fantasia, whose heroes smoke weed and watch very bad things on the internet before their everyday lives are swept away by a global pandemic, is among the most widely sanctioned by American schools. The particularly censorious Utah State Board of Education even bans pupils from carrying a copy into school to read in their personal time. All such perilous tomes, advises the board, must not be given away or resold but instead sent to a specified warehouse in a box clearly marked “sensitive materials”. Not to be outdone, in 2024 a Texas school district banned Oryx and Crake because it promoted “gender fluidity”.View image in fullscreenHarry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stoneby JK RowlingThe famous children’s books about witches and wizards might be more likely to attract opprobrium these days on the grounds of the author’s political opinions, but long before that, Potterphobes were trying to get the books off school shelves in the US on the grounds that they glorify the occult or actually “promote witchcraft”. They succeeded in a few cases, such as Zeeland, Michigan in 1999, andNashville, Tennessee, in 2019. Which begs the question, can you promote something if it doesn’t exist?View image in fullscreenMilk and Honeyby Rupi KaurThe Indian-Canadian poet rose to fame on Instagram, and this collection of social media-friendly minimalist verse was initially self-published in 2014 before coming out commercially and going on to sell more than 11m copies. Popularity, however, is no defence against the literary‑prohibition complex, which in this case cited not Kaur’s refusal to employ upper-case letters but the fact that some of her poems explore themes of sexual assault. It was the joint-ninth most-banned book by US school districts in the 2022-23 school year and remains off limits in districts across eight states.View image in fullscreenThe Kite Runnerby Khaled HosseiniHosseini’s 2003 novel set in Afghanistan before the Soviet occupation and then under the Taliban, which has sold more than 8m copies worldwide, has long been among the most banned books in US school districts, for its depictions of homosexuality, violence, or inter-Afghan ethnic tensions. The 2007 film adaptation wasbanned in Afghanistanitself under the government of Hamid Karzai. The Kite Runner is now one of many books removed from shelves in schools run by the US Department of Defense pending a review announced in 2024 – a ban that chimes with Donald Trump’s targeting of DEI.View image in fullscreenNineteen Eighty-Fourby George OrwellOrwell’s story of totalitarian truth-twisting may have been partly inspired by his experience of working for the BBC, but the Soviets felt it was obviously aimed at them, and so the novel was banned in the USSR until 1988, along with homegrown masterworks such as Vasily Grossman’s second world war epic Life and Fate. But Orwell’s relevance has not since diminished: Russians protesting against the Ukraine war have been arrested for giving out free copies of Nineteen Eighty-Four, while it remains forbidden to mention the novel’s title on Chinese social media.The Satanic Versesby Salman RushdieThe man who stabbed Rushdie in 2022, in an attempt to fulfil the Iranian fatwa, said at his sentencing that the writer “wants to bully other people. I don’t agree with that.” Apparently trying to kill people doesn’t count. Rushdie’s 1988 novel, which contains a dream-sequence riff on the life of the prophet Muhammad, was publicly burned in Bolton and Bradford, and banned in many countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sudan, Sri Lanka and Venezuela. In India, though, the original banning order seems to have been lost, leading a court to state in 2024 that it may no longer be valid.View image in fullscreenThe Bluest Eyeby Toni MorrisonMorrison’s debut novel, a fable about a young Black girl in the US who wishes her eyes would turn blue so that she would be perceived as beautiful, remains surprisingly controversial for a book that was published 55 years ago, coming in third on the American Library Association’s list ofmost frequently challenged books in 2024, and being banned in 29 school districts in the 2022-3 school year. Her later novel Beloved is almost as popular a target, proving that winning a Nobel prize in literature does not suffice to make your work suitable for teenagers.View image in fullscreenPersepolisby Marjane SatrapiThis graphic novel about a young woman growing up during the Islamic revolution in Iran was originally published in French in 2000. It was banned (as the author had foreseen) in Iran and for a while in Lebanon, but controversy struck when it wasbanned by the public schools of Chicago in 2013. That decision was later reversed, but Persepolis continues to be challenged and banned in states including, in 2023 and 24, Alaska, Iowa and Wisconsin. Such bans usually cite the book’s “graphic language and images” (a graphic novel is indeed likely to contain graphic images), though one complaining parent wrote to her Illinois school board to ask “why a book about Muslims was assigned on September 11”.View image in fullscreenChina Dreamby Ma JianIf you wanted to curry favour with the Chinese Communist party, you probably wouldn’t use as your novel’s title a phrase taken from President Xi himself, which he uses to describe a “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”, or indeed have as narrator an ambitious provincial political operative whose job is, as Ma has explained, “to suppress memories of the past and control speech in the present”. This 2018 novel is of course banned in China, as all Ma’s work has been since 1987, but it was the first that no Hong Kong publisher would touch, either. The party, he says, has “an army of censors”.View image in fullscreenLolitaby Vladimir NabokovThe novel that made Nabokov’s fortune was first published in France in 1955, since no American publisher would risk it. Its English-language publisher in France, Olympia Press, lost a lawsuit with the government the following year and the book was banned from sale. Meanwhile in Britain, it was illegal to import such “utter filth” and publication in the UK, as well as in Argentina and South Africa, was banned for several years: in New Zealand, it became legal only in 1964. For the New York Times in 1958 (when the French ban was lifted), Orville Prescott judged the novel “dull, dull, dull in a pretentious, florid and archly fatuous fashion”, and also “repulsive”. It is currently banned in three American school districts.View image in fullscreenNineteen Minutesby Jodi PicoultThis 2007 novel about a school shooting has the dubious honour of currently being the most widely sanctioned book by school districts in the US, according to writers’ group PEN America, with 98 bans. Does suppressing fiction about school shootings reduce the number of actual school shootings? This remains to be demonstrated. In any case, the most commonly cited reason for deeming Picoult’s novel unsuitable for teenagers is, as she explained at the Hay festival last year, her use on page 313 of the word “erection”.View image in fullscreenLady Chatterley’s Loverby DH LawrenceThe subject of the most celebrated obscenity trial of the 20th century, Lawrence’s pastoral romp was banned in Britain and other countries after its original private publication in 1928, though heavily expurgated versions were made available in the US and UK in 1932. Not until 1960 did a mainstream publisher, Penguin Books, attempt to bring out the full text, prompting a showdown with the government. “Is it a book you would have lying around in your own house?” asked the lead prosecutor on behalf of the Crown. “Is it a book you would even wish your wife or your servants to read?” The answer seemed to be yes, as Penguin won.Thirteen Reasons Whyby Jay AsherTV adaptations are usually good news for novels. After the 2017 Netflix adaptation of Asher’s YA teen-suicide novel hit the screens, the book was banned by school districts in eight US states. Some argued that the more sensationalised TV version was much more likely to have encouraged a seeming rash of real-life suicides in the following months. Banning the text, the author told a PBS interviewer, was likely to be counterproductive: “If we say issues of teen suicide, drinking, sex or sexual assaults are inappropriate, we’re telling teens who may identify with those themes that there isn’t a safe space for them.”View image in fullscreenLysistrataby AristophanesAristophanes’s 2,500-year-old comedy about women who go on sex strike in order to stop the Greek city states from fighting each other is plainly likely to sap the masculine spirit of any modern nation-state that emphasises marital virtue. Logical, then, that it should have been banned in its homeland under the Nazi occupation and then under the military junta that took over Greece in 1967. From 1873, meanwhile, it was also banned in the US under the Comstock laws that prohibited lewd or obscene material from being sent through the post, a ban that was successfully overturned only in 1954.View image in fullscreenThe Hate U Giveby Angie ThomasThomas’s much-admired YA novel about a Black teenager who sees her close friend shot by a police officer has, predictably, come high on the lists of books that are “most challenged” in American school districts since it was published in 2017. The various reasons include profanity, drug use and sexual references but also “racially insensitive language” – the latter a concern cited by the white superintendent of the Katy Independent School District in Texas, who personally pulled copies off the shelves. “You’re basically telling the kids … that their stories shouldn’t be told,”Thomas responded. “Well, I’m going to tell them even louder. Thanks for igniting the fire.”View image in fullscreenFanny Hillby John ClelandCleland wrote this pioneering 18th-century tract of very bawdy fiction – ostensibly the “memoirs of a woman of pleasure” – while in debtors’ prison. Within a year of its publication his publishers had been hauled to court on suspicion of “corrupting the King’s subjects” and the book was officially withdrawn, though samizdat copies continued to circulate. In the early 19th century a pirated version was published in the US, leading to that publisher’s conviction in Massachusetts for printing something so “lewd and obscene”. Remarkably, police seized a new edition of the novel in London in the 1960s under the Obscene Publications Act of 1959, and the unexpurgated Fanny was not legally revealed until 1970.View image in fullscreenThe Witchesby Roald DahlDahl’s oeuvre has recently been the subject of enthusiastic Bowdlerisation by Puffin, which releasedpolitically corrected versionsof his texts in 2023 that, among other things, removed the word “fat”. But The Witches (1983) had already long been the subject of complaints in American schools. While liberal critics thought it misogynist because Dahl writes that witches are always women, concerned American parents had it banned in Dallas, Oregon for promoting occultism, and in Dublin, Ohio on the curious grounds that it was “derogatory to children”.View image in fullscreenAmerican Psychoby Bret Easton EllisEllis’s satirical masterpiece of men’s fashion, 1980s music pedantry and ultraviolence, having been dropped by its original publisher Simon & Schuster only three months before its publication date and then rescued by Vintage, has excited outrage in the censorially minded forever after. In the late 1990s Germany restricted sales to adults only, and for many years it was officially banned from sale in the state of Queensland, Australia, though in one of literary freedom’s smallest ever victories it can now be purchased shrink-wrapped, as long as you are over 18.View image in fullscreenThe Handmaid’s Taleby Margaret AtwoodAny author who appears twice on such a list must be doing something right. Since her most famous novel is about a future United States devolving into a repressive sexist theocracy, the routine rightwing attempts to remove it from schools in the present-day US do come across as a case of protesting too much. The Handmaid’s Tale has been removed from school libraries in at least 10 US states. After it was made unavailable to high-school students in Madison County, Virginia, in 2023, Atwood suggested that perhaps the censorious wonks hoped to get teenagers interested in sex again by making mentions of it in print forbidden – and so irresistible. It remains banned in 67 US school districts.View image in fullscreenSlaughterhouse-Fiveby Kurt VonnegutVonnegut’s first bestseller, centring on the firebombing of Dresden (which he had witnessed first-hand), but also with a satirically freewheeling attitude to matters religious, sexual and cosmic, was something of a pioneer in the school-banning stakes. A mere three years after its 1969 publication, it was banned in schools in Oakland, Michigan for being, as a judge thought, “depraved, immoral, psychotic, vulgar and anti-Christian”. In 1973, copies were burned in North Dakota because of its “obscene language”. In 2010 a college professor complained: “This is a book that contains so much profane language, it would make a sailor blush with shame.” In 2024, the novel was banned by school boards in Texas andFlorida.

The creators explain how this deliriously fun music went viralIan McQuaidSat 23 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTShareAt this year’s Fête de la Musique in Paris, British ravers who had streamed over to enjoy the annual street party – think Notting Hill carnival without the procession – found themselves hearing, and then swiftly dancing to, a wildly uptempo tune calledBouwéy.Built from a languid vocal at odds with clattering African percussion, the track bowled out from sound systems and car windows, quite unlike anything else: a defining song of the summer. Made by Guadeloupean act 1T1, Bouwéy has now hit 12m views on YouTube. But its frenetic pace and startling synth work haven’t arrived in a vacuum – instead it is the vanguard of a sound known as bouyon, part of a whirlwind of dance genres leaping out from the Caribbean to the world, including atNotting Hill carnivalthis weekend.“The bouyon is a faster riddim,” chuckles Hillary “Tilly” Thomas over the phone. “You have to drink some rum – it’s carnival music, not everyone can handle it. You have to be crazy!”Tilly, a mainstay in the bouyon scene since the 00s, now manages rising Dominican star DJ Taffy: countless vocalists have hopped on to his frenetic, warbling instrumentalFunny Riddim. “Bouyon is a Dominican French word meaning a mixture of foods,” Tilly says. “Let’s say you’re cooking; you put yam, banana, chicken, fish, dumpling with all the seasonings, it’s an all in one dish. So the music is a fusion of African beats, soca, EDM, the Haitian music kompa, French music and calypso. Like the food, we put it all together to make one pot, it’s a fusion of all Caribbean music. And then it has the ‘dom dom dom’” – he makes the unmistakable sound of a thudding kick drum. “That’s how you know it’s bouyon.”It’s the genre’s sexualised lyrics – known as “nasty business” in Dominica – that have really turned heads, though, delighting young fans but also dismayingCaribbeanradio station bosses. “The nastiness [paired] with the pulsating rhythm, it really and truly brought the music to the world,” Tilly says. “Controversy sells!With only 44 million people spread across its islands, the Caribbean has had an extraordinarily disproportionate impact on music around the globe. Often western media will use Jamaican culture as interchangeable with that of the whole Caribbean, and while reggae and dancehall remain in rude health, their international acclaim can obscure the fact that the other islands have been gestating their own styles for decades.Tilly is at pains to point out that bouyon is not new – he mentions 90s big bands such as WCK and Triple 0 as laying the groundwork, followed by 2010s breakthrough acts such as Asa Bantan and the producer Arade Moses, who has acted as mentor for DJ Taffy. But something has changed since 2020: cheap production technology, the availability of low cost digital distribution (along with the late arrival of Spotify to the Caribbean in 2021), and the rise of TikTok have all conspired to push these high tempo styles into the limelight.This has spread beyond bouyon. In St Lucia, the local variant of the sound is known as dennery segment, the name deriving from the village Dennery where many of the artists originated. Over the last year, scene leader Bozo, who produces under the name of Bad Sound, has had tracks such asBoth Twanche Riddim Refixplayed everywhere from St Lucian raves to London’s tastemakingNTS Radio.He also attributes this newfound success to his ability to blend different styles: the Both Twanche remix fuses dennery segment with the insistent house music of New Jersey, along with a sample from Portuguese producer DJ Marfox. While to the uninitiated dennery may sound like a hyperspeed cousin of soca – the already rapidly undulating iteration of calypso – Bozo points to Africa as the prime source of inspiration. “Kuduro is the bigger influence,” he tells me, referring to the similarly high tempo Angolan dance style. “We try to merge other genres together.”This magpie mix of styles, frenetic pace, and scandalous lyrics has made bouyon and dennery the perfect soundtrack for TikTok’s attention grabbing accounts. But as kids from London, Paris and New York have started tuning in to the sound, not everyone at home has been quick to welcome the success.UK reggae pioneers Steel Pulse: ‘We told punk fans – you can pogo, but please don’t spit at us’Read more“There was a point in time,” Bozo recalls, “when the radio stations wanted to ban the genre because they said it was too explicit. Then when the songs started blowing up, they thought: ‘OK, maybe we’ll give it a try.’ Now we embrace it as our own. Social media has played a big part.”For his part, Tilly thinks that the use of explicit lyrics was just a stepping stone to breaking through to a wider audience. “I told the guys making it: ‘Don’t worry, I’ll take the blame for the lyrics.’ We used the nasty business to get the music out in the world. Now we’ve done that, we’re back making real bouyon; love songs, serious songs.”He may be right. The success of a lyrically PG track such as Bouwéy has proved that controversial lyrics aren’t needed for success, and the producer Arade Moses, on the line with Tilly, is certain. “We always knew it would go somewhere,” he says. “It’s so energy-driven, and the way the youth react to it is so different. True bouyon is too melodic to be stopped!”Explore more on these topicsMusicNotting Hill carnivalFestivalsCaribbeanJamaicaSt LuciaHaitifeaturesShareReuse this content"

I wouldn’t mind keeping 10 back just in case I need to hurl them at a random person. That leaves 46. How rotten are they? Maybe I’ll eat 10, which leaves 36.

Have you ever been rudely evicted in real life?I was rudely evicted in Edinburgh about four years ago, where I am now. They threw me out and my stuff was gone thank to some scandalous landlords. I think I managed to grab one bag of stuff, but when I went back to get the rest, it was gone. Definitely lost in that transaction was a very nice radio. The writing on the wall really was when I arrived and they had a toilet roll holder in the lounge. I don’t know what was going on in that place. You never know quite where you’re going to get with Edinburgh accommodation.I’m here now.Who last addressed you as “Timothy?”A nurse on Tuesday.What’s the shortest poem you’ve ever written?“Tanya Googled herself. Still nothing.”You’re also about to star in follow-up to the US version of The Office, The Paper, which follows the staff at a small-town American newspaper. What would you do if you were editor of the Guardian for the day?I don’t really read newspapers. I just buy them to do the crossword. I think I’d probably make the Guardian bigger again, because it’s small now. I’d make it an unwieldy, difficult thing to read, and put the cryptic crossword on the back page. The sports section currently is wrapped up in the culture section. I’d free that, because that’s the only bit that I really read.You also play Sidekick Simon to Alan Partridge.

I’ve since met Mike Atherton, the [former] England cricket captain, and he was lovely. But I was at a book signing in Cheltenham and – you tell me if this is cringeworthy – my friend and I followed him at safe distance to a pub and then sat at a safe distance on a different table. I think it’s really cringeworthy because you get people who pluck up the courage to say: “I think you’re fantastic.” But I didn’t even have that courage. I just sort of sat nearby. I wasn’t even close enough to tell you what aftershave he was wearing.Please explain the virtues of the humble fig roll, a biscuit you have famously been pictured eating in the past.It’s a fantastic biscuit. The best part is that you can kid yourself into thinking it’s healthy because it does have fruit in it. So the optics are good. It is not a dark chocolate McVitie’s digestive situation which you clearly know is bad for you because of the chocolate. Also, it’s a very nice hard biscuit. There’s some crunch to it, but it’s very good for dipping in coffee. It softens very quickly and I would say is certainly in my top three biscuits at this stage.McVitie’s haverecently come outand said you should be eating your digestives chocolate-side down.I can see the benefits in eating them upside down. The tongue tastes more of the chocolate and the chocolate doesn’t coat the roof of the mouth. Is that the idea?

It was a beautiful production in Liverpool with a community choir on stage, very emotional, and the perfect play. I cried more or less throughout, amazingly.Would you rather die at the bottom of the ocean or deep out into space?I think both are pretty lonely, but space is more spectacular, isn’t it?

Whether cosy or brutal, true-crime-ish or fictional, filled with forensic crime scenes and hazmat-suited people shuffling out of despoiled apartments, or with twinkly-eyed character actors sampling cake and making coppers look like chumps, or with stylish lone women menaced by a criminal mystery that only they can solve … crime is everywhere, and showing it’s a solid bet at the movies.True crime and cold crime podcast fanciers are being catered for, and lovers of genteel murder mysteries, and those who might enjoy a sophisticated comic twist on crime in a luxurious or blue-collar setting. Streaming platforms have shown that documentaries about crime get views, and terrestrial television has long since allowed drama to be dominated by crime. The movies are now taking the hint.There is tasty-looking fare with The Woman in Cabin 10, adapted from the page-turner by Ruth Ware, with Keira Knightley as a lone travel writer on a luxurious cruise liner who is convinced she has seen someone thrown overboard but can’t find any way of proving it. Veteran feelgood director Chris Columbus has taken on Richard Osman’s smash hit novel The Thursday Murder Club, with Helen Mirren, Celia Imrie, Ben Kingsley and Pierce Brosnan as the quirky residents in a British retirement community who with indomitable grit solve crimes that have left the uniformed police removing their helmets to scratch their heads.But heavy-hitter directors are also giving us films with a crime tinge.Darren Aronofskyhas pivoted from the sensitive body-image themes of his previous film The Whale, to make Caught Stealing, based on the cult bestseller by Charlie Huston, with Austin Butler as a former baseball player in New York who gets mixed up with the city’s criminal underbelly.Paul Thomas Anderson is about to give us what promises to be a black comic paranoid fantasia on the subject of all sorts of crime, withOne Battle After Another, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s novel Vineland.Perhaps the most startling auteur take on crime this autumn is Kelly Reichardt’s fascinatingThe Mastermind, starring Josh O’Connor. This famously quietist and realist film-maker has now created her own intriguing version of the heist drama. Ocean’s Eleven it isn’t, but in its intimate ordinariness, its unhurried ambient detail and moment-by-moment observational detail, is weirdly gripping. O’Connor plays an art school dropout and loser in 1960s Massachusetts who figures he can pay a couple of goons and a getaway driver to help him steal four paintings from a museum, having already established, in an unobtrusively nailbiting initial scene, that he can pinch objects from a glass cabinet without anyone noticing. But he winds up having to make a chaotic getaway himself.By way of contrast there is the grandiose brashness of Spike Lee, who offers his own defiantly personal take on Akira Kurosawa’s 1963 noirHigh and Low– pumping up the remake with superlatives in the title,Highest 2 Lowest– with Denzel Washington as a big-shot music producer whose godson is accidentally taken by kidnappers. A far-fetched suspense sequence set on a New York subway train has hints of that 70s crime classicThe Taking of Pelham 123, and the pure chutzpah and sweep of the film is extremely enjoyable, though perhaps Japanese cinema purists will not like it.View image in fullscreenGrimy allure … Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst in The Roofman.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyDerek Cianfrance is a director associated with romance and with realist emotional complexity, but he too has now succumbed to the grimy allure of true-crime with The Roofman, starring Channing Tatum as Jeffrey Manchester. In the 1990s, Manchester became a US pop-culture antihero in some quarters, dubbed “The Roofman” by the press for his habit of breaking into branches of McDonald’s through the roof in the dead of night, hiding in the lavatories, and then at opening time, emerging and robbing everyone. The movie promises to be part of that 90s-style black-comic variant of crime that is proving popular again.And quite aside from these single-issue prestige features, there is the return of Rian Johnson’s wildly popular crime movie series Knives Out, which gave Daniel Craig a returning franchise gig at the very moment he had stepped down from James Bond. He returns as droll detective Benoit Blanc in Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, which has a religious theme and the same sprightly tongue-in-cheek tone. The title might be a playful tribute to the courage of one of its actors: Jeremy Renner, making his first film since his near-death experience of being run over by a snowplough in 2023.Crime, it seems, is coming in many flavours.Explore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsPaul Thomas AndersonSpike LeeKelly ReichardtDarren AronofskyFilm adaptationsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the talks show the enthusiasm with which the technology secretary has embraced the artificial intelligence sector, despite concerns over the accuracy of some chatbot responses andimplications for privacy and copyright.OpenAI offers free and subscription versions ofChatGPT. The paid version, ChatGPT Plus, costs $20 a month and gives users faster response times and priority access to new features.Kyle dined with Altman in March and April, according to transparency data released by the UK government. In July, Kyle signed an agreement with OpenAI to use AI in the UK’s public services. The non-binding deal could give OpenAI access to government data and lead to its software being used in education, defence, security and the justice system.View image in fullscreenSecretary of state for science, innovation and technology Peter Kyle.Photograph: Thomas Krych/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockKyle has been a vocal champion of AI within government and has also embraced its use in his own role. In March, it emerged that he hadasked ChatGPT for adviceon a range of work-related questions, including why British businesses were not adopting AI and what podcasts he should appear on.The minister told PoliticsHome in January: “ChatGPT is fantastically good, and where there are things that you really struggle to understand in depth, ChatGPT can be a very good tutor for it.”The UK is one of OpenAI’s top five markets for paid ChatGPT subscriptions. An OpenAI spokesperson said: “Millions of Brits are already using ChatGPT every day for free. In July, we signed an MoU [a memorandum of understanding] with the government to explore how we can best support the growth of AI in the UK, for the UK.“In line with the government’s vision of using this technology to unlock economic opportunity for everyday people, our shared goal is to democratise access to AI. The more people who can use it, the more widely its benefits will spread.”The company has been in talks with several governments in recent months and has agreed a deal with the United Arab Emirates to “enable ChatGPT nationwide” and use the technology in public sectors including transport, healthcare and education.The UK government has been keen to attract AI investment from the US,having struck dealswith OpenAI’s rivals Google and Anthropic earlier this year.Kyle has said that if a new UN security council were to be set up in a decade, technological clout – particularly in AI – would be a major factor in determining the most powerful countries. He told the Rest is Politics podcast in the spring: “I want us to be at the very forefront of [AI] because those countries will get to shape how it goes, how it is used and deployed.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The judge said that while she accepted some of Clarke’s evidence, “overall I find that he was not a credible or reliable witness”.Harriet Wistrich, lawyer and chief executive of the Centre for Women’s Justice, said the judgment was “great news” and “a blow to wealthy and famous men who think they can use money to silence women”.“Noel Clarke could easily have avoided being named as a sexual predator accused of harassing women. All he had to do was not act in ways that constitute sexual harassment,” said Karen Ingala Smith, former chief executive of domestic and sexual violence charity nia.“Clarke now adds himself to the list of wealthy abusive men who have tried and failed to use the law to minimise, hide or deny their behaviour,” she added. “My thoughts are with his victims and I am glad justice has been upheld.”Charlotte Proudman, a barrister whose book He Said, She Said revealed how women are silenced in the family courts, said: “This judgment is a landmark moment for survivors of sexual ​misconduct and for investigative journalism.“The court’s finding that the Guardian’s reporting was substantially true sends a clear message: women who come forward should be believed, and journalists who investigate abuse play a vital role in holding perpetrators to account.“It is a victory not just for the women who bravely spoke out, but for press freedom and public interest reporting as a whole.”Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: “It is vital that there is freedom to report on cases like this, yet we know that journalists are often held back from reporting due to the threat of legal action from those with power and status.“The law should not be weaponised by perpetrators to silence survivors. However, this often plays out in the criminal justice system and the media, with women’s credibility put under the microscope, contributing to a culture of disbelief of women across society.”Earlier this summer, the UK government announced plans to stop bosses using NDAs to silence abused workers.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Ukraine was previously given authority by theBiden administrationto use the missile system against targets inside Russia in November after North Korean troops entered the war.Before the inauguration in January, Trumptold Time magazinethat the decision to allow Ukraine to use US weapons systems to attack targets inside Russia had been a mistake.“I disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles intoRussia. Why are we doing that? We’re just escalating this war and making it worse. That should not have been allowed to be done,” he said.It is unclear whether the US defense department’s review process amounts to a formal policy change. But it comes alongside increasing control of munitions to Ukraine as US stocks are themselves depleted.Russia rules out European troops in Ukraine as Trump makes veiled threatsRead moreIn a statement to the Journal, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump “has been very clear that the war in Ukraine needs to end. There has been no change in military posture in Russia-Ukraine at this time.”But last week, amid efforts to broker talks between the Russian president and Voldomyr Zelenskyy, Trump said that Ukraine couldn’t defeat Russia unless it could “play offense” in the war.“It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invader’s country,”Trump wroteon Thursday. “It’s like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offense. There is no chance of winning.”Last month, the US agreed to supply Ukraine with new weapons systems but only if European nations paid for them. While Trump has said that the US is “not looking” to provide longer-range weapons that could reach Moscow, US officials told the Journal that the administration has approved the sale of 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition air-launched missiles, or Erams, which have a range of 280 miles (400km).Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUkraineRussiaUS politicsEuropeVladimir PutinShareReuse this content"

But a closer look at the facts shows Anna has been dismissing calls for an inquiry since day one.”Dixon denies the claims and said she only voted against a Tory proposal for a national inquiry into grooming gangs because it included an amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill. She also rebutted suggestions that she opposes aBradforddistrict focus as part of the inquiry.Moore said he condemns threats of violence but said the video he posted “raises legitimate concerns” about Dixon’s position on a grooming gangs inquiry in Bradford.In a statement on Saturday Dixon said: “I want local residents to be aware that I have received threats of death and violence directly posted in response to a misleading video recently shared by the MP for Keighley and Ilkley, Robbie Moore.“These have been reported to the police, and an investigation is currently under way. It is irresponsible behaviour for any MP of any party to put out such blatant misinformation about a colleague.”Dixon added: “I have always been transparent and direct with constituents about my reasons for voting in favour of the government’s children’s wellbeing and schools bill in January 2025, and I am disturbed by Robbie Moore’s seeming willingness to spread misinformation on this scale with his constituents and beyond, particularly when it pertains to such a serious issue.“In January, the Conservative party put forward a proposal for a national inquiry into grooming gangs by introducing a wrecking amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill. If this amendment had passed, it would have effectively killed the bill, which aimed to enhance safeguards for children.“I am also shocked by the claim made in the video shared by Robbie Moore that I would oppose a Bradford district focus as part of a national inquiry into grooming gangs. This is extremely concerning when the video in question features extracts from an email I sent to one of my constituents on 6 August, the full text of which includes the statement: ‘If the national inquiry deems that another local inquiry is needed in Bradford, this is something I and the local authority will fully support.’ He has chosen to omit this from his video.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unfortunately, the MP for Shipley was not one of them.“We are now in a situation in Bradford where victims and survivors and leading child abuse lawyers are desperately calling for a focus on Bradford in the grooming gangs inquiry, with a sitting Labour peer explicitly saying there has been a cover-up inside Bradford council.“The fact that the MP for Shipley does not and, from her public comments today, still does not unequivocally support a focus on Bradford in this national inquiry is both a newsworthy and legitimate concern.”Explore more on these topicsBradfordLabourConservativesChildrenChild protectionUK child abuse inquirySexual violencenewsShareReuse this content"

It will remain in place until 7am on Sunday. A 37-year-old woman was arrested in the city on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker, Avon and Somerset police said, while in Liverpool there were 11 arrests for offences including being drunk and disorderly, assault and affray, as a UK Independence party protest was met by a counter-demonstration.In Horley, Surrey, about 200 anti-immigration protesters draped in St George and union flags clashed with roughly 50 Stand Up to Racism protesters in Bonehurst Road. The anti-racism protesters chanted: “Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here,” and held signs calling for solidarity and to “stop deportations”.They were met with a torrent of abuse from the anti-migration group, one of whom yelled through a megaphone: “You’re all scum and you should be ashamed.”Demonstrators and counter-protesters gathered outside the Radisson Blu hotel in Perth, with Abolish Asylum System supporters met by Perth Against Racism. Stand Up to Racism Scotland said it had achieved “victory” in the city, with more than 200 gathering to oppose the protest against asylum hotels.View image in fullscreenPolice separate rival protesters from Abolish Asylum System and Stand Up to Racism in Newcastle.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianThere has been continued tension around the use of the hotels to house asylum seekers. On Tuesday, the high court granted Epping Forest district council a temporary injunction to remove asylum seekers from the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex, from 12 September.Regular protests had been held outside the hotel in recent weeks after an asylum seeker was charged with trying to kiss a 14-year-old girl, which he denies.The government announced plans on Friday to appeal against the high court’s refusal to allow it to intervene in the case, and to further appeal against the temporary injunction.Other local councils have also announced their intention to seek legal advice as to whether they could achieve a similar injunction for hotels in their areas.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Enough is enough. No more American taxpayer dollars to Nethanyahu’s [sic] war machine.”Sanders, who also pushed resolutions to ban selling US weapons to Israel, has long been consistent about his concern regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza amid the war.Marjorie Taylor Greene, the outspoken, far-right Georgia Republican, also called for greater compassion for Palestinians in a social media post Saturday, a day after UN secretary general António Gutteres described the famine in the territory as a “failure of humanity”.The US representative, in a departure from the majority of her peers in Congress, described the Gaza humanitarian crisis as a genocide last month. In along post on X, she then said that while Israel’s war against Hamas was justified, the suffering of civilians was not.“Does Hamas deserve it? Yes,” Greene wrote, in part. “Do innocent people and children deserve it? No.”“The innocent people in Gaza did not kill and kidnap the innocent people in Israel on Oct 7th,” she continued. “Just as we spoke out and had compassion for the victims and families of Oct7, how can Americans not speak out and have compassion for the masses of innocent people and children in Gaza?”Greene linked the entirety of US financial and military aid to Israel to the conflict, arguing that it “means every U.S. tax payer is contributing to Israel’s military actions”.“I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to pay for genocide in a foreign country against a foreign people for a foreign war that I had nothing to do with,” Greene concluded. “And I will not be silent about it.”The post received an almost immediate response from far-right influencer Laura Loomer, who reportedly petitioned the White Houseto suspendthe entry of injured Palestinian children from Gaza to the US.Greene and Loomer, both claiming the mantle of Maga authenticity, have bitterly clashed on the issue, withLoomerfalsely describing Palestinian children as a “national security threat” and “Islamic invaders”.Loomer, who is Jewish, once claimed that her ban from social media platforms for anti-Muslim hate speech was antisemitic, while Greene infamously shared an antisemitic conspiracy theory that wildfires in California might have been started by Jewish space lasers.On Saturday, Loomer hit out at Greene, falsely accusing her of calling for Palestinians from Gaza to be resettled in the US and asking: “Why are you advocating for GAZANS to come to the US? How is Islamic immigration ‘America First’?”Marjorie Taylor Greene says Republican party has lost touch with its baseRead moreThe UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)saidlast week that parts of Gaza are experiencing a “man-made” famine in the Gaza governorate, which includes Gaza City, site of a new Israeli offensive.“As thisFamineis entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,” the report said. “The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed.”The Israeli agency heading aid distribution in Gaza, the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), rejected the report, saying it “relies on partial, biased data and superficial information originating from Hamas”.On Saturday, Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel,said on Xthat “the [international] media is missing the real story of ‘famine’ in Gaza. Hostages ARE starving, Hamas is getting fat, & the UN declares famine while 92% of THEIR food is stolen to be sold by Hamas. Meanwhile UN food sits rotting in sun. The UN should declare itself corrupt & incompetent.”In her post, Greene wrote that if the US were being bombed day and night, with millions killed or injured, and the world said “Americans voted for their government so they deserve it… How would you feel? What would you think? What would you do?”Explore more on these topicsMarjorie Taylor GreeneIsrael-Gaza warFamineGazaUS politicsHouse of RepresentativesBernie SandersnewsShareReuse this content"

His private member’s bill for an official inquiry into UK involvement in theIsrael-Gaza warwas blocked by the government at its second reading in July.Instead, the Peace and Justice Project, founded by Corbyn, is holding a two-day event called the “Gaza tribunal”. A website dedicated to the event says it will “examine Britain’s role in war crimes perpetrated in Gaza” by “hearing from experts and witnesses”, and “establish the full scale of our government’s complicity in the genocide against the Palestinian people”.Diane Abbott: I advised Jeremy Corbyn not to start new partyRead moreOn Saturday, Corbyn told an audience at the Edinburgh festival fringe that Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the occupiedPalestinian territories, would be offering her views to the hearings. He told the event that his “tribunal” would seek answers on the use of the RAF Akrotiri airbase around the war in Gaza, as well as other issues.Corbyn, interviewed on stage by the musician Calum Baird, said: “What we’ve done through the Peace and Justice Project is set up a two-day open public inquiry on 4 and 5 September in Church House in Westminster.“We’ve invited people to make submissions – lawyers and others and voices from Gaza and the West Bank and other places – in order to put forward their view on the policy.

She was to take the vehicle in convoy with a British volunteer to Kramatorsk in the contested Donbas region.She arrived in Ukraine on 4 June and reportedly sustained “injuries incompatible with life” in a Russian drone strike on the morning of 11 June, according to a police file. The Kramatorsk district police department said her body “remains in an area of active hostilities, making it impossible to conduct evacuation measures” to transfer it to the forensic medical examination department.Based on this information, her relatives have asked for a death certificate to be issued either through local authorities or theForeign, Commonwealth and Development Office(FCDO). They said this would allow them to grieve properly for the “brave, capable and determined” mother of three and begin the probate process.Katarzyna Bylok, the founder of Aid Ukraine UK, told the PA Media news agency that issuing a death certificate could take months or years, as Lewis Marffy’s remains could not be safely recovered.She described the area where the volunteer was allegedly killed as a “kill zone”.“It leaves her family in a horrible red-tape limbo,” she said. “They will never get her body. But what they need is the ability to close her affairs. Her sons have their hands tied; they don’t have power of attorney.”View image in fullscreenAnnie Lewis Marffy with the green Toyota Rav4 she used to drive across Ukraine.Photograph: Aid Ukraine UK/PAThe family said: “All the family, the sisters and the sons, have been very disappointed at the reaction of the FCDO and the lack of response from the police.“After all this time, we haven’t got any report at all from the Ukrainian police. That has to come from Ukraine and would be sent to Devon and Cornwall police.”They said police had retained Lewis Marffy’s computer for analysis, which contained information that would help the family manage her affairs.“The family are desperate to get more information. Her sons have been told that their mother is missing, presumed dead,” they said.Bylok said there was an expedited process in Ukraine to certify deaths in cases where remains could not be recovered, though it still took six to 12 months. “There is enough evidence to prove that Annie is dead,” she said. “The procedures stating that you need to have remains or DNA for a death certificate need to be updated.”Lewis Marffy travelled throughEuropein convoy with a former soldier from Wales, who had to return to the UK after becoming unwell in Poland. After it was suggested she should hand the vehicle to Aid Ukraine teams in Lviv, she insisted she would continue her mission to deliver the supplies to the Ukrainian military in Kramatorsk.She contacted Aid Ukraine on the evening of 10 June, saying she was 55 minutes from her destination. After failing to hear from Lewis Marffy, Bylok posted a picture of her on Telegram and asked for information about her whereabouts. Police then contacted Bylok to say Lewis Marffy had been killed, she said.An FCDO spokesperson said: “We are supporting the family of a British woman who is missing in Ukraine and are in contact with the local authorities.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeUkraineEuropeDevonRussianewsShareReuse this content"

This week, the region was the subject of what appears to have been a failed negotiationbetween Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. The Russian president demanded all of Donetsk – which together with Luhansk oblast makes up theDonbas region– as part of a peace deal, a proposal that Trump seemed to have briefly endorsed even though Ukraine rejected it.Map showing areas controlled by Russia in Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblastsRussia’s arguments change, but in Putin’s eyes, Donetsk, traditionally a Russian-speaking industrial region in Ukraine’s east, is culturally closer to Moscow than Kyiv. People who live there, however, have a very different view. They show no interest in seeing the land of Donetsk given up; it is their land after all.A few minutes earlier, Bohdan had photographed the nearby site of a Russian bombing in the centre of the city on 31 July that had killed five, taking an image of a damaged tree in front of a ruined apartment block. His plan is to turn the image into a tattoo: “The tree is symbolic; like Ukraine, it holds on despite the strike.”View image in fullscreenBohdan’s tattoo with the dates and cities where Russian strikes killed more than 15 civilians. ‘These dates should stay with me,’ he says.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianIt is not his first body art. On the soldier’s left calf is a list of all Russian airstrikes that caused more than 15 civilian casualties anywhere in Ukraine. Bohdan had it done four months ago, while changing units. As the transition was taking place, he says, “I was having a civilian life, mostly. It was so easy to forget what’s going on.”The frontline is about 12 miles away at the nearest point, but Kramatorsk remains relatively lively in the daytime August sun. Though the air raid alarm goes off regularly, that is for missiles passing over, locals say; when an attack on the city does come, they add ominously, there is no warning.About a quarter of a million Ukrainian civilians live in Kramatorsk and the rest of Donetsk, about an eighth of pre-invasion levels. Many windows are boarded up, but the city is not significantly damaged. Some shops and cafes still open, such as Kateryna Seledtsova’s Sweet Coffee House Bakery, which has an array of fruit cakes, eclairs and other creamy-looking offerings behind the counter.View image in fullscreenKateryna Seledtsova, the owner of Sweet Coffee House Bakery, in front of her cafe.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianThe change in Kramatorsk’s population – it has become increasingly male–dominated because of the arrival of soldiers into the area – means that Seledtsova has refined her menu. “Men like simpler food,” she says, explaining that she had switched out French-style pastries for layered Napoleon cake or trubochki, waffle tubes filled with condensed milk. Whatever she bakes, she adds, sells out daily, such is the demand.Giving away the rest of Donetsk strikes Seledtsova “as idiocy. Men have been digging trenches here. All of those fortifications for nothing? I don’t believe it will happen, it is just stupid.” The baker’s life is here: Seledtsova is from Kramatorsk, the city also of her father and eight-year-old son, and the idea of being forced to move out is, she says, so hard to take seriously that it is best not thought about much.Could there be a price worth paying, giving up land in Ukraine, including where she lives, in return perhaps for Nato membership? She just sees practical complications: “There are already a lot of problems with evacuation. For example, it’s impossible for us just to go somewhere and buy or rent an apartment elsewhere in Ukraine because we don’t have the money.”Relocation programmes, she says, are not attractive because the housing offered is not comparable. “A lot of people who fled, as far as I know, are living in kindergartens. They don’t even have money to buy things like proper medicines,” and she wonders how the Ukrainian state with its limited resources would be able to make a programme work.What about staying under Russia? “I would never work under those motherfuckers. Of course no, no,” and giggles at the strength of her feeling.View image in fullscreenValentyna with her grandsons in the park in Sloviansk.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianIn Sloviansk, north of Kramatorsk, Valentyna and Yelena are with their grandsons aged five and six in the city’s well-tended central park. The children play in small electric cars, but thebabusyas(grandmothers) are frustrated. “You are a journalist, you could make some efforts for peace, we need to shout out for peace,” says Valentyna. Pressed on whether they believed giving up land could be acceptable, all Valentyna will say is that “we want the war to stop.”If Ukraine is forced to give up Donetsk they would flee if they have to, Valentyna says, because “the children have problems with their mental health. They are shaking during the nights.” In-person classes, lasting four hours a day, have been halted again as the security situation has deteriorated. “We were in a playground and we saw a Shahed drone just above our heads, flying so low, three days ago – and there were 10, 12 children who were playing there, just watching.”View image in fullscreenValentyna selling grapes from her garden at the market in Sloviansk.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianAt Sloviansk market, local people sell surplus produce from their gardens, some of the best agricultural land in the world. A woman, also called Valentyna, offers grapes for 80 hryvnia (£1.44) a kilo. “They are talking about trading people, like ancient times, when there was a lord and his serfs,” she says as she sells 2kg from the piles of red and white grapes on her table. “We should keep going and fighting for our lands. These are Ukrainian lands; there are recognised borders.”Trump needs to understand what the war in Ukraine is really about | Kenneth RothRead moreDonetsk province remains where the heaviest fighting is taking place along the long frontline, particularly around Pokrovsk, 35 miles south-west of Kramatorsk. Regional officials prove reluctant to give interviews, because of the political sensitivities of the moment, but Vadym Filashkin, the governor of Donestsk, reported on Thursday morning that three had been killed in Kostyantinivka, while on Friday settlements were attacked 26 times and 3,649 people were evacuated.The consequences of the unceasing war can be seen in nearby Pavlohrad, to the west, in a neighbouring region. A refugee centre has been operating in the city for nearly a year, to receive people with nowhere to go. But as the Russian offensive has intensified, the number of refugees arriving has increased to “350 to 450 people a day for the past two weeks”, according to Kateryna Makarova, the team leader on the site. It compares with 200 a day two months ago, and 100 during the winter.View image in fullscreenKateryna Makarova, a manager at the transit refugee centre in Pavlohrad, Dnipropetrovsk region.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianConditions at the site, a former cultural centre, are cramped. In an auditorium, beds are placed next to each other on the stage for those who cannot immediately be rehoused. An emergency dormitory shelter is being built in a tent to increase the overnight capacity from 100 to more than 200, though that is not obviously a solution when the weather turns. Another reception centre is being opened in the city of Dnipro, further west, Makarova adds.News reports indicate Trump’s peace efforts have gone nowhere. Few in and around Donetsk are surprised. Planning continues in Ukraine to deal with Russia’s gradual advance, attacks that show no sign of halting. Netting is being erected along the safest supply route into Kramatorsk before it can be targeted by Russia’s increasingly effective drone crews, though at the current rates of advance it will probably take years to conquer Donetsk, and at a cost of 30,000 Russian casualties a month.Nevertheless, it is prudent to plan for the worst. “We are trying to figure out the algorithm for how we should work when there will be more evacuations,” says Makarova. “There are a large amount of people living in Kramatorsk, Sloviansk and other towns, and if there will be an evacuation there, there will be a huge amount of people coming. We need to understand how to act in that situation.”View image in fullscreenNadiya and Serhii were evacuated from Mezhova, Dnipropetrovsk region, to the transit refugee centre in Pavlohrad.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianSerhii and Nadiya, a couple who have been married 46 years, are sitting out in the early evening sun with their lives’ possessions in a dozen or so plastic bags by them. They are not even from Donetsk, but Mezhova, 10 miles into Dnipropetrovsk oblast, victims of a metastasisation of the war that, for all Russia’s stated interest in Donetsk, is spreading beyond its borders. Serhii admits “we never thought the war would come to our village” until drone strikes began two months ago.The couple are surprisingly calm, in the circumstances, though Serhii admits to taking some Valium to help, and are hoping to join one of their daughters, whenever a volunteer can drive them from the refugee centre. Tonight, though, they are staying at the refugee centre and Nadiya comes over to say goodbye as we leave.“They [the Russians] are saying we’re brothers, but if I would have such a brother, I would change my last name and my father’s name,” Serhii says. “I don’t need this kind of brother.”"

Two hilly, wooded parcels of land in Llanafan Fawr have been bought by the Woodlander Initiative (TWI), a land-buying scheme led by Simon Birkett, a far-right figure with links to Patriotic Alternative, the UK’s largest fascist group. Critics say Wiltshire-based Birkett’s aim is to create a racially exclusive settlement; he has citedOrania, a whites-only town in South Africa, as an inspiration for the project.TWI successfully bought the two small plots totalling a few acres from a local farmer late last year, after attempts in Cumbria and East Sussex fell through. Since launching in 2023, the group has raised £165,000 of a goal of £1m – money Birkett plans to use to buy land or property in every county in Britain.“We need to start building that alternative, our own businesses, our own institutions,” Birkett said during an address at Patriotic Alternative’s annual conference last October. “We need our own schools, with our own rules.”View image in fullscreenTents, huts and solar panels have been put on the site in Llanafan Fawr.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianHe added: “We need our own areas, we need our own land, we need our own buildings, we need our own conference centres. We need our own communities for our own culture. And it is down to us to start building it.”Birkett is now making this dream a reality. No one was around during the Guardian’s visit last week, but the larger plot – previously an open field – is now a campsite. It hosted several tents, along with camping gear, solar panels, a wood store and a toilet block. Some of the fencing was clearly new and, at the second hilly, wooded site, a small gazebo was perched among the oak trees.According to anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate, which exposed the TWI purchases in Llanafan Fawr, Birkett has already hosted members of PA at the sites, which are about 20 metres apart. A “family camp weekend” is planned for 13-14 September.Birkett and others using the TWI properties have sought help from the community. The area is accessed via a road belonging to the neighbouring farm owned by Delia and John Weedon, who said that people at the site have previously asked them for water, and help putting up fencing.“I helped them out by driving some wood and fencing stuff up the hill once. They seemed nice enough, they wave sometimes when they’re going by,” John Weedon said. “We only heard about these far-right rumours later. Now the whole area is talking about them.”TWI denies it is a white supremacist organisation. In an email to the Guardian, Birkett said that TWI is not building a village, although that would be “a worthwhile endeavour”, and noted that the group’s membership criteria “does not mention colour or ethnicity”. Its constitution states it is a non-political organisation aimed at “building community, friendships, skills and fraternity”.View image in fullscreenDelia and John Weedon said the group use one of their tracks to access the land but they haven’t been any trouble.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianHowever, in a recent article, Birkett invoked the “great replacement” conspiracy theory, claiming that “those in power” are “intentionally replacing one population with another”, and that “white Europeans are being outbred” by migrants.Last week, dozens of videos on TWI’s YouTube channel in which Birkett talks about his political views, including how he hopes Llanafan Fawr will become a “beacon surrounded by darkness where every other town around becomes more diverse, more corrupt”, appeared to have been taken down.It is unclear whether William Jones, the farmer who sold the land to Birkett, knew about his buyer’s background in advance. Jones could not be reached, and his wife, Joanne, declined to comment.A few miles away in Builth Wells, the nearest town to tiny Llanafan Fawr, reaction to TWI’s presence was mixed.Leigh Price, the owner of survivalist shop the Bug Out, said several members of TWI had bought supplies and equipment from him, and Birkett had been in touch by phone to ask advice about where to find building materials locally.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t think you can be right wing or say anything much these days without getting outlawed as a far-right group,” he said.Jamie Owen, a bartender at the 14th-century Fountain Inn, said he was taken aback to find out about TWI. “Why here in Builth? They’re not local,” he said. “I would hope they’d get short shrift if they came into town.”A shop owner on the high street, who asked not to be named, said: “I can imagine there will be some people here who welcome them. All I hear about from customers and in the pub is Reform, Reform, Reform, immigrants … Even though we don’t really have many in Builth.”View image in fullscreenBuilth Wells mayor Mark Hammond at the council offices in Strand Hall, which also has a concert hall. He said he hopes TWI keep to themselves.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianMayor Mark Hammond said that he hoped TWI would keep to themselves. “This part of Powys is very independent-minded, very mixed, politically. They may well get some support here, but if they cause any issues for the farmers or people who are very protective of the Welsh rural culture, then I can see there being some backlash.”According to Hope Not Hate senior researcher David Lawrence, the far right in Britain has long dreamed of establishing whites-only communities, and similar efforts have been pursued by Combat 18, the British National Party, and the now-proscribed terrorist organisation National Action.“These initiatives face significant financial and logistical challenges, and most have either failed to materialise, fractured due to internal conflict, or been abandoned due to dismal conditions and the property sold off,” he said.Yet as far-right groups frustrated by electoral politics mountgrowing anti-migrant protests, the idea of racially exclusive enclaves appears to once again be gaining traction in extremist circles. In a recent article in the fascist magazine Heritage & Destiny, Patriotic Alternative leader Mark Collett praised TWI as a “fantastic initiative”.“This is a long-term plan that will hopefully catch on and turn into the establishment of indigenous heartlands – places for our people,” he said.Explore more on these topicsFar rightWalesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I had a part-time job at a sneaker shop in Sydney and spent most of my shifts gazing idly out the window.In December 2011, a woman I’d never seen before wandered past. I was instantly drawn to this coolness she exuded, but as she walked on by I figured that was it, I’d never see her again. A few minutes later, she came back from the other direction and walked right in. Later, I’d learn she had noticed me too and had come back for a closer look, but at the time I was oblivious, far more worried about how I’d shoot my shot now she was right in front of me.She was really friendly and asked about a very specific pair of shoes. We didn’t have her size and I knew we’d never stock them again, but I went through the motions of taking down her details anyway. There was definitely a little vibe, and as it turned out we were both using the same goofy tactics to maximise our exposure to each other. She had no interest in the shoes.View image in fullscreenTom and Sam on their wedding dayAs we chatted, Sam told me she lived nearby and was opening her own shop just a few doors down. I felt like such a kid in the company of this sophisticated businesswoman.A few weeks later, when her shop opened, I casually popped in to say hello. Before long I was dropping off coffees in the morning and wandering down on every cigarette break in the hope that if I just hung around enough something might happen.On Christmas Eve she invited me over to her place. I can remember having to concoct some story to get out of dinner at my parent’s so I could spend the evening listening to music and polishing off a bottle of rum with a girl I was besotted with. We kissed that night, but much to my disappointment, I was quickly relegated to the friend zone. I sort of accepted that I would probably just have this crush forever or, if I was lucky, eventually my omnipresence would spark a romantic interest in her.We saw each other virtually every day for six months and were texting and chatting on the phone constantly, but I still wasn’t getting any closer to making her fall in love with me. Then one day I was headed to work and noticed a sign on her shop saying it was closed due health reasons. I’d just run into Sam at an Aphex Twin concert the night before so I knew something was off.There was a number on the note, so I texted it just to check if everything was OK. It turned out she’d been in a serious car wreck. The desperation I felt for her to be alright was overwhelming and it was in that moment I realised my feelings went well beyond a boyish infatuation.View image in fullscreenTom and Sam in Los Angeles with their baby daughterIt would be weeks before I heard from Sam and got the full picture. It turned out Sam had consumed a substance at the concert that wasn’t what she thought it was. The accident had happened as she tried to drive herself to safety in a panic. In my own way, I made it clear I had all the time and energy in the world to help her recover and over the next few months we slowly became a couple.The moment I knew: crying over my ex, he comforted me without jealousy or judgmentRead moreWhile Sam’s physical injuries were pretty serious, the psychological and judicial fallout from the accident was immense. It was a life-altering event for Sam and, by extension, me. The whole saga dragged on for more than five years.As draining and full-on as it all was, it definitely brought us closer together and gave us a chance to see and feel the lengths we’d go to to support each other.View image in fullscreenTom, Sam and Genie at the TeamLab museum in Tokyo in AprilAs the dark clouds of the accident began to disperse, we moved to Melbourne and started making music together. We took off to London in 2019, then moved on to Berlin where we’ve built our music careers and a family at the same time.The feelings I had for Sam from that very first encounter were so pure and so deep it really felt fated. No one had ever made me feel more comfortable in myself. And I still feel exactly the same. Just being around her, no matter what is going on, always just feels right and safe. There’s no doubt she has brought out the best in me and made room for so many parts of me to grow and expand that might have otherwise lain dormant. To meet someone whose light shines on you in that way is out of this world.Tom McAlister (Big Ever) and Samantha Poulter (Logic1000) are performing at Melbourne’sNow or Neverfestival, running 21-31 August 2025Explore more on these topicsRelationshipsThe moment I knewFamilyAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

And we got answers. From the right order to applyskincare products, to how much face scrubbing is too much, it turns out a lot of us have the same questions, even when we don’t always want to hear the answers.For instance: do I really need to wear sunscreen? “I feel like we’ve given you all the reasons why, and debunked all the different myths and all the reasons from TikTok why you shouldn’t wear it, but as soon as you clear one [post or video], another one pops up,” says Dr Corey L Hartman, a dermatologist in Birmingham, Alabama.But if you’re ready for some hard truths (no, you should not pop that pimple) our panel of six expert dermatologists gave us all the science-backed answers that you won’t always get from your favorite influencer.Meet the experts:Dr Doris Day, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City and clinical associate professor of dermatology at New York University Langone medical center.Dr Corey L Hartman, a board-certified dermatologist based in Birmingham, Alabama, and adjunct associate professor of dermatology at UAB Heersink School of Medicine.Dr Divya Shokeen, a board-certified dermatologist and hair transplant surgeon based in southern California.Dr Mamina Turegano, a board-certified dermatologist, internist and dermatopathologist based in New Orleans, Louisiana.Dr Claire Wolinsky, a board-certified dermatologist based in New York City and clinical instructor of dermatology at Weill-Cornell medical center.Dr Josh Zeichner, a board-certified dermatologist based in New York City and associate professor of dermatology and director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai hospital in New York City.Washing your faceDo I really need to wash my face at nightandin the morning?Turegano: It’s important to wash your face in the evening because your face has been exposed to the elements and to smoke, pollution, the buildup of sweat, dirt and grime. Opinions are mixed regarding washing in the morning. It can be helpful in the am because people do sweat, and oil builds up at night. You may use skin care at night. You want to wash all that off before you apply products in the morning. So at least rinse with water.Hartman: Washing your face daily used to be the standard. We told everyone they had to wash their face when they wake up and before they go to bed at night. Washing your face at night is essential; you need to remove dirt, oil and impurities before going to sleep. But some people, especially if they have dry skin, may find that if they go to bed with a clean face, they may not need to do a full face wash in the morning. Most people still wash their face in the morning, and that’s perfectly OK to do, especially if you are washing off face masks or other overnight products on the skin, or if your skin feels oily in the morning.(You can read the Guardian’s guide tothe best facial cleansers in the US here.)Should I be wary of scrubbing and cleaning my face too much?Shokeen: Cleansing is probably the most important step in your skincare routine because you want to remove things that are on your skin that could be harming it, but we tend to over-wash in search of getting that squeaky-clean sensation. Avoid anything that leaves your skin squeaky-clean – that’s a sign it’s stripping too much.Do I need to wash my upper chest and neck along with my face?Day: Yes, you might apply makeup, sunscreen, or lotion to those areas and they should be cleansed even if you are not showering at night.Come on, is it really that bad to skip washing now and then?Turegano: Cleansing skin is an underrated skin care step. A lot of my young patients like to go to sleep with makeup on – they think they’re invincible – but the effects add up over time and can accelerate ageing.SunscreenDo I have to wear sunscreen every day?Hartman: Yes. You should wear sunscreen every day. All the skincare products you use daily mean nothing if you are not protecting your skin from sun exposure each day.Zeichner: Yes. You need sunscreen every day – not just when you are at the beach. Incidental UV light adds up over a lifetime. So whether you are on your commute to work or sitting outside for lunch, you are at risk for UV damage.Shokeen: Yes! As Ben Franklin said: “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”I have SPF in my makeup. Do I still need sunscreen?Zeichner: Yes. You are likely not applying as much makeup as you would need to get the level of SPF labeled on the bottle. You need about a quarter-sized dollop of sunscreen for your full face. Putting that much makeup on will leave you looking like you have caked-on makeup. The small amount of makeup you are using means that SPF in the makeup gets diluted. The solution is to layer your makeup over a moisturizer with sunscreen.Can I use a retinoid in the summer?Wolinsky: You don’t need to switch your cleanser and moisturizer seasonably, but you can if you’d like to. In summer, I like benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid for acne-prone skin in addition to a retinoid – as long as you’re not dry and irritated. Retinoids are fine to use in the summer with a sunscreen and good sun protection. Retinoids can make the skin more prone to a sunburn so sun protection is key, but you don’t need to stop the retinoid.ProductsDo I need a 20-step skincare routine?Zeichner: No. Simple is better and easier for you to stick to. The morning is time for prevention of damage and protection against environmental exposures. Stick to a vitamin C serum plus sunscreen. The evening is time for hydration and repair. Apply a moisturizer and a collagen stimulating ingredient like retinol, peptides, hydroxy acids, or bakuchiol.How can I determine my skin type?Hartman: One of the best ways to determine your skin type is to observe your skin without any products on it for about an hour after cleansing. Wash your face and leave it alone for an hour. If your skin feels tight, your skin is likely dry. If it looks or feel oily, your skin is oily. If you are only oily on parts of your face like your T-zone, your skin is likely combination. If it feels comfortable, you likely have normal skin.Day: I think that everybody is combination, so we aren’t really a type. And that can change depending on the time of year, or time of month. It changes. You get drier with age for sure. So I think of people as prone to things rather than having a type. So you’re prone to redness, you’re prone to breakouts, or you’re prone to discoloration.In what order should I put on products?Hartman:Skincareproducts should be applied from the thinnest to the thickest products. The typical AM order would be: cleanser, toner/essence, serum, spot treatment, moisturizer, sunscreen. Follow the same rationale in the evening: cleanser, toner/essence, serum, moisturizer or night cream.Is moisturizing anti-ageing?Wolinsky: Moisturizing is not in and of itself anti-ageing unless the product contains a retinoid. A moisturizer can make the skin look better day to day and make fine lines appear softer, but hydrating the skin isn’t anti-ageing. A moisturizer can only be anti-ageing if it has anti-aging ingredients like retinoids, which help build collagen and increase skin cell turnover.Should I be using retinol?Hartman: Everyone should be using a retinol; it is one of the most researched and most effective ingredients proven to transform the look of the skin. Retinol helps regulate cellular turnover, effectively exfoliates, evens discoloration in the skin, helps control oil production, smooths fine lines and wrinkles and more. There are some terrific OTC retinols that you can use daily, or even better, a prescription retinoid that you can get from your board-certified dermatologist.Pimples and other problemsWhat should I do if I have a pimple emergency and an event tomorrow?Turegano: The fastest way to get rid of it is to see your dermatologist for a cortisone injection. You can also use over the counter options like pimple patches, spot treatments with sulfur or benzoyl peroxide, and even ice to calm the inflammation.Can I pop this?Shokeen: Spoiler: please don’t. Short and sweet – no.Is this breakout hormonal?Shokeen: If it’s deep and painful, around your jawline and a week or so before your [menstrual] cycle, yes, chances are good.How do I get rid of these dark spots?Shokeen: Retinol, SPF, and your dermatologist.Is this mole normal?Shokeen: Definitely your dermatologist needs to confirm [by examining it].Why is this happening to me now?Day: If somebody gets rosacea, which you typically don’t get until your thirties, and they go, ‘Well, I never had this before. Why am I getting it now?’ I say, ‘Well, some things you don’t get as a kid. Some things happen to you as an adult.’ But they’re always shocked that they have a new condition in their skin that they didn’t have before. And I don’t get why people are shocked.Responses have been edited and condensed for clarityExplore more on these topicsSkincareBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But a follow-up episode about the logistics of clean-up? You don’t see that very oftenGraeme VirtueSat 23 Aug 2025 18.00 EDTShareWith his medicine-ball biceps and chin worthy of an Easter Island moai, the wrestler turned actor John Cena can actually pull off wearing a daft comic book outfit, shiny silver helmet and all. That’s what makes Cena’s spandex-clad Chris Smith AKA Peacemaker so inherently funny: he looks the part but is a demonstrably terrible superhero. Being a hard-charging, self-sabotaging meathead with a propensity for violence and a hair-trigger temper will never make you as beloved as Superman. But it can be highly entertaining to watch.To give Peacemaker his due, he is a survivor. He was first introduced in James Gunn’s 2021 movieThe Suicide Squad, a film that bumped off cast members with glee, before gettinghis own small-screen spin-off overseen by Gunn in 2022. That brash and blackly comic first season shaded in some childhood trauma – Smith accidentally killed his older brother in a brawl instigated by their racist father – but also gave Peacemaker his first big win: saving the world from an alien invasion by sparkly butterfly creatures.Gunn has been on an upswing too. After being promoted to co-running DC Studios, he recently rebooted the entire DC superhero screen universe with a generally well-receivednew take on Superman. Back at the helm for Peacemaker season two, the writer and director seems keen to demonstrate that he has not lost his punk edge. Clark Kent may never curse, but the Peacemaker cast are happy to take up the sweary slack. (Notable additions to the ensemble include Tim Meadows as an oddball government agent and Frank Grillo as a ruthless colonel with a distinctly non-military pompadour.)View image in fullscreenFlinty … Jennifer Holland in Peacemaker season two.Photograph: HBOThe action picks up a month after the events of Superman, and Smith is struggling to parlay his alien invasion foiling into a sustainable superhero career. Things aren’t going much better for his local cohort of found family. Tetchy hacker Economos (Steve Agee) is being forced to surveil Peacemaker by the shady Argus agency, the usually sunny Adebayo (Danielle Brooks) is struggling with a breakup and flinty butt-kicker Emilia (Jennifer Holland) is now a pariah in the intelligence community. (In a fractious psych evaluation, Emilia snaps and calls her doctor “a fucking cunt” but quickly recovers: “In England, cunt means friend!”) Only semi-reformed serial killer Adrian (Freddie Stroma) seems to be doing OK, even if his new interest in owls verges on the obsessive.After a particularly crushing career setback, Smith digs out a cocaine baggie marked “for a rainy day” and tries to party away his pain. What follows is an expansive and sustained orgy scene that must have required bringing in intimacy coordinators by the busload. Plenty of other HBO shows have featured group sex scenes, but Peacemaker is the first where the post-orgy logistics of cleaning up and turfing participants out are addressed in a subsequent episode.Bubbling away beneath all this self-loathing is Peacemaker’s discovery that the Tardis-style storage unit he uses to stash his guns and helmets is actually a quantum gateway to 99 other universes, including one alternate reality where things turned out better for Chris Smith. Should he keep plugging away in a world where it feels as if he can never do anything right? Or rush toward a dimension where Peacemaker is beloved and has a cool customised motorbike called the P-Cycle? As Adebayo sagely notes: “This is becoming some fucked-up Twilight Zone shit.”The sporadic bursts ofThe Boys-style ultraviolence – with geysers of blood, smashed teeth and even eyeballs going flying – will be as much of a barrier to entry for some as the constant hair metal needle drops. But underneath all the crunching fight scenes and crass jokes there is real heart. Gunn clearly loved these damaged characters enough to carry them over to his shiny new universe, but he is also never afraid to put them through the wringer. It makes even the tiniest victories in their lives feel momentous.The show would also collapse without the full-body commitment of Cena. He has long nailed the petulant side of Peacemaker while hurling himself into the physical comedy. As the longstanding attraction between Smith and Emilia intensifies this season, he also gets to play goofily romantic. Is he a good actor, or a great one? In an upcoming episode there is a scene where Smith is deeply hungover and blearily begins checking his phone while relieving himself. Mid-stream he realises how late he is going to be for a vital meeting. The sight of Cena angrily shouting “PISS!” at himself to try to speed things up is an Emmy-worthy masterclass.Peacemaker season two is on Sky Max and Now in the UK and HBO Max in the US and Australia.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionSuperhero moviesSuperhero TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

I didn’t study computer science. I’ve never written a line of code. I haven’t spent my career immersed in the processes, debates and science of technological progress. I came to Meta, Facebook as it then was, in 2018 as an emigre from the world of British and European politics. I wasn’t really sure what to expect.As an Englishman, I never cease to be amazed by the sheer scale of America. It’s striking, when you first set foot in this part of Northern California, how remote it feels from the power centres of the east coast. It’s not just the nearly 3,000 miles that separate you from Washington DC and New York; the three-hour time difference means you feel out of sync. The day’s news agenda is in full flight on the east coast before the west is awake. The biggest European stories broke the night before. It’s like you’re far away from everywhere. It’s no wonder people who want to strike out on their own, at a safe distance from the prying eyes of the men in suits, are attracted to this place. It’s a natural home for idealists who want to stick it to the man.There’s something intoxicating about Silicon Valley. This is a place where people say yes. It’s a magnet for smart people buzzing with creativity. There are no limits to ambition. Every obstacle is an opportunity. Every beautiful day could be the day something amazing happens. Anyone could have an idea that could change the world – and get filthy rich. But it is also an industrial-scale breeding ground for hubris, of a largely macho kind, too (it is still a place where, on the whole, confident men with big egos rule the roost and smart, capable women have to fight for their place every step of the way). The isolation that makes it the perfect petri dish for new ideas is also what distances it from the lives of ordinary people. The wealth of the place distances it from their struggles. Its idealism distances it from the messy realities of their lives.Facebook was like the Lib Dems in coalition – idealists who couldn’t figure out why people saw them as the bad guysWhen I arrived atFacebook, I found a company in shellshock. Many employees had joined when its reputation was starkly different: an exciting, idealistic place led by a boy genius, making cool things people were taking up at a phenomenal rate, generating oodles of cash, and with a high-minded mission to connect the world. Going from whiz-kids to public enemy number one was a culture shock few were truly prepared for. It reminded me a little of the Liberal Democrats during the coalition – a collection of idealists who wanted to change the world and who couldn’t quite figure out why people saw them as the bad guys.One of the biggest culture shocks I experienced in Silicon Valley had nothing to do with differences between the UK and the US, per se. It was because the worlds I had moved in since I first left for university in the mid 1980s were ones where the primary way of succeeding was through the power of words. Politics, at its heart, is a competition between different stories about how things should be. That’s what liberalism, socialism, conservatism and fascism ultimately are: stories that give us different ways of looking at the world, different diagnoses of our problems, and different solutions, too. You win elections if more people sympathise with your telling of events and your vision of the future than with those of your opponents.But Silicon Valley is full of people who see the world a different way: engineers. Theirs is a world of facts and process. The engineer’s mindset is to identify a problem and fix it, then move on to the next problem. They operate in a maze of acronyms, as if language itself is a time-wasting exercise that needs to be boiled down to its most abbreviated form. On arrival, I was plunged into a world of XFNs, STOs and FOAs, where every roadmap has a playbook, every community is part of an ecosystem, and where every subject is either a tl;dr or a deep dive. And everything – everything – has to be quantified. In an early meeting, I remember being asked by one senior engineer what the percentage likelihood was that government X would pass a law about Y. I laughed. I thought it was a playful joke. The idea that political processes could be boiled down to a sort of faux-science seemed silly to me. He didn’t laugh. So I said something like, “Oh, well, 23.67%.” He nodded earnestly. I have since come to realise that, in order to persuade people in Silicon Valley, compelling stories are useless without data points for every argument and probabilities for every outcome. And it has rubbed off on me. Approaching problems in a systematic way, however faux the science might be, helps to order your thought process and guide you towards clear decisions.View image in fullscreen‘He may be the most competitive person I’ve ever met’: with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in April 2019.Photograph: Niall Carson/PABut it is also reductive. It commodifies everything, removes nuance and instinct and all the intangible aspects of human nature. When I talked to engineers in my early days at the company about data, they talked about it the way a carpenter would talk about wood – a material to be used to make amazing things, not people’s precious personal information. That mindset has changed since, in part because of a wider cultural shift in people’s expectations of privacy and data protection, and in part because change has been forced upon the company by regulators. But the primacy of logic and reason over emotion and gut instinct gives a clue, perhaps, as to why Silicon Valley can often seem tone deaf to the concerns of people beyond the walls of its primary-coloured campuses.No one – I mean no one – can hold a silence like Mark. He will let it hang as he muses, often to an excruciating degreeI am probably not the sort of person you would expect to find in Silicon Valley. I spent my career in a suit and tie, not a hoodie and flip-flops. My first instinct, when confronted with the hundreds of brightly coloured sloganeering posters that adorn the walls of every meeting room and corridor of Facebook’s extraordinary MPK campus (another acronym, this one a somewhat unnecessary shortening of Menlo Park), was to do something very English: apply gentle mockery. In one of the first meetings I held with one of the teams I had just taken charge of, a poster on the wall declared the ubiquitous Silicon Valley mantra: Bring Your Authentic Self to Work. To try to break the ice, I said, “Please don’t bring your authentic self to work. You wouldn’t like my authentic self if I brought it to work. So just bring your inauthentic self to work from nine to five and then you can go home and be yourself and we’ll get on perfectly well.” Stony silence. One of the team came up to me rather coyly afterwards to say that the message had been quite disconcerting for them. I knew then that I wasn’t in Kansas any more.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Lots of people who achieve great success, especially at a young age, can tend to get stuck in their ways and rest on their laurels. Mark, on the other hand, has the humility, drive and appetite to keep learning. If he thinks he doesn’t know something, he will grill the people who do and devour every bit of wisdom and insight he can on the subject. He’ll think long and hard and consider every angle. And no one – I mean no one – can hold a silence like Mark. I’m a talker – if there’s a moment of silence in a conversation, I’ll burble on witlessly to fill the void. Mark will let the silence hang in the air as he muses, often to an excruciating degree. But when he does open his mouth, the response is invariably thoughtful and considered. He may be perceived as the epitome of the engineer’s mindset – all logic, no emotion – but that shouldn’t be mistaken for a lack of depth or curiosity. Quite the opposite.At the same time, he may be the most competitive person I’ve ever met. And I say that as a former frontline politician and a product of the British private school system, so I’ve met some pretty competitive people in my time.One of the ways this competitive streak expresses itself is through Mark’s love of mixed martial arts (MMA). He is a big fan of UFC and takes his own training extremely seriously – so much so that his MMA fighting had to be disclosed to investors as a potential business risk. He may have emerged into the public consciousness two decades ago as a skinny nerd, but he’s certainly bulked up since then. Just ask Elon Musk, who challenged Mark to an MMA fight in an exchange on X, and then made all manner of excuses to avoid actually getting in the cage with him. Mark’s commitment to MMA is so strong that he insisted one morning, during a management offsite, that some of his most senior executives join him for a training session at his purpose-built gym. We all paired off to practise some moves under the watchful eyes of Mark’s professional instructors, which meant I found myself wrestling with my then deputy, Joel Kaplan. At one point this involved a manoeuvre known as the Domination Mount, in which Joel straddled me and we grappled awkwardly in a way that was, let’s just say, a little too close for comfort. It was corporate bonding taken to a whole new level.Joel later jokingly confessed he had considered reporting it to our then head of HR, Lori Goler, but when he looked up to find her, he saw that she had Mark Zuckerberg in a chokehold. At least surviving such an ordeal meant that Joel was battle hardened, if somewhat bizarrely, to meet the challenge of succeeding me as head of the company’s global affairs operation when I leftMetasome time later.This is an edited extract from How to Save the Internet byNick Clegg, published by Bodley Headat £25.

Many of the cheaper olives I tasted have a strong, wine-vinegar acidity that I don’t really enjoy straight from the jar. I do, however, appreciate that punch when they’re paired with other ingredients: sliced on pizza, tossed into salads or, my favourite, skewered with an anchovy and a pickled guindilla pepper to make that classic Basquepintxo, the gilda.

What about next time?The close call in Tracy Arm 50 miles south of Juneau on 10 August is the latest sign that as glaciers melt, risks may riseTim Lydon in AnchorageSat 23 Aug 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 23 Aug 2025 19.49 EDTShareThe landslide that triggered a powerful tsunami in Alaska’s Inside Passage early on 10 August was a close call, say scientists, tour operators and agency officials, with the risk of such events apparently increasing as glaciers retreat because of climate change.“It’s a historic event,” said scientist Dennis Staley from the US Geological Survey of the slide, which occurred in the Tracy Arm fjord 50 miles (80km) south of Juneau.“I feel like we dodged a bullet,” he continued, of reports that no one had been hurt, at a destination that can see more than 500,000 annual visitors.Staley studies landslide hazards in Alaska, including in popular tourism areas. Tracy Arm is a narrow 30-mile (48km) fjord, with sheer walls looming thousands of feet above the water. It ends at the face of the South Sawyer glacier. The dramatic scenery, part of the Tongass national forest, attracts kayakers, boaters and a steady stream of packed cruise ships. But the channel was apparently empty at 5.30am on Sunday, 10 August, when without warning a colossal piece of the fjord wall collapsed.Staley says it’s too early to know theprecise size of the slide. But by analyzing its seismic signal, he and others estimate up to 100m cubic meters of rock, or more, fell near the face of the South Sawyer glacier. It threw a wave of ocean water an incredible 1,400ft (425 meters) up the opposite side of the fjord, which will likely make it one of the largest such waves ever recorded. Staley can see its impact on trees and brush in satellite imagery and aerial photographs.Seconds later, a tsunami estimated at up to 100ft (30 meters) tall barreled down the inlet, stripping forest and brush from either shore. Thirty miles away, the wave was still 15ft high (5 meters) as it swelled up against the remote Harbor Island, coming within inches of a tent where Sasha Calvey and two other kayakers were camped.View image in fullscreen‘Tracy Arm is a narrow 30-mile (48km) fjord, with sheer walls looming thousands of feet above the water.’Photograph: Landslide Hazards Program/US Geological SurveyThe kayakers scrambled awake to find half of their gear had been washed away. One kayak hung from a bluff, another was wedged against a tree and a third bobbed in the ocean a quarter mile away. The water remained chaotic for hours, says Calvey.Although they had to be rescued, ending a 78-day expedition from Washington state, Calvey knows they were lucky. If the tsunami had occurred only three hours earlier, when the tide level was 10ft higher, they may not have survived.Jeffrey and Christine Smith had planned to anchor their 65ft tour boat, the David B, for an overnight stay in Tracy Arm. But rainy weather led them to anchor about 45 miles away instead. The morning of the slide, they saw water rise 10ft along the shore near their anchorage.“We’ve been feeling a little mortal,” Christine Smith said after learning how narrowly they missed the slide.The landslide occurred just hours before a sightseeing vessel from Juneau and a National Geographic tour boat, each with capacity for more than 100 passengers, were scheduled to visit Tracy Arm. Two cruise ships carrying thousands of passengers each had visited the area less than 24 hours earlier. Another cruise ship was scheduled for the next day.Staley and others marvel at the luck, where poor weather, early morning timing and a falling tide apparently conspired to prevent casualties. In another bit of luck, a portion of the slide landed on the South Sawyer glacier. If its full weight had hit the water, says Staley, the tsunami could have been even larger.But some geologists worry that luck may be running out. Landslides near retreating glaciers appear to be increasing, in Alaska and elsewhere. One possible cause is that glacial ice, which can be hundreds of feet thick, may help support mountain walls above them. Scientists debate whether rapid glacial retreat, like is happening at Tracy Arm and across the globe,may “de-buttress”mountainsides by removing supportive ice that has been in place for centuries.Climate change is also thawing high-elevation permafrost around the world. When permafrost thaws, explains Staley, changes in pressure, temperature and hydrology can cause instability deep within steep slopes . Scientists believethawing permafrostcontributed to a massive landslide and glacier collapse that wiped out the Swiss village of Blatten earlier this summer.Staley emphasizes that it’s too early to say what led to the Tracy Arm slide.“We have to be careful,” he says. “We can’t say with any real certainty what triggered this event.”Michael West, the state seismologist who directs the Alaska Earthquake Center in Fairbanks, agrees it’s too early to identify a trigger for the slide, which he calls “shockingly huge”. But he says it’s notable that this and other tsunami-causing landslides have occurred near retreating glaciers in recent years. He says it’s reasonable to explore the ideas of de-buttressing and thawing permafrost in Tracy Arm, along with other factors like recent rain in the area.In2015, a landslidenear a receding glacier in Taan fiord in south-east Alaska sent water 630ft up a nearby slope. A 2024 landslide near the Surprise glacier in Prince William Sound, more than 500 miles north-west of Tracy Arm, caused a small tsunami.And last summer, alarge landslidealongside the receding Pedersen glacier in Kenai Fjords national park near Seward, Alaska, triggered a wave estimated at 60-180ft.Barriers prevent severe flooding in Alaska capital after glacier outburstRead moreScientists also have a wary eye on a recently discoveredweak slope above the receding Portage glacier, an hour south-east of Anchorage. If it fails, researchers say, it could trigger a tsunami in Portage Lake that could slam into a nearby Chugach national forest visitor center that sees up to 1,000 people daily in summer.They’re also monitoring a 3,000ftunstable slope in the Barry Arminlet in Prince William Sound. If it fails, modeling shows it can trigger a tsunami comparable to the one in Tracy Arm. Barry Arm and surrounding waters are also popular among boaters, kayakers, cruise ships and others.Since the Barry Arm instability was discovered in 2020, scientists have installed high tech equipment to track precipitation, slope movement and other conditions on the mountain. They hope the work will improve understanding of the ties among landslides, glaciers and climate change.Although no such instrumentation was present at Tracy Arm, West says that work at Barry Arm helped geologists quickly pinpoint the event by analyzing real-time data from more than250 seismic stationsaround Alaska.“That’s a new capability,” says West, explaining that scientists took days to locate the 2015 Taan fiord slide. But using the new method, they identified the Tracy Arm location shortly after calls came in from boats in the area.“But this is where it gets wild,” continues West.He says that review of seismic monitoring sites shows a seismic “popping” was occurring at the Tracy Arm site for roughly 24 hours before the slide, with hundreds of small signals detectable 100 miles away. They suddenly ended with the slide.“Not every landslide does this,” says West, who hopes to research this phenomenon to better understand possible warning signals.Explore more on these topicsAlaskaGlaciersLandslidesTsunamisClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They have to make decisions that are very important.”Arsenal put five past Leeds but lose Ødegaard and Saka to injuryRead moreSpurs had agreed a fee with Crystal Palace for Eze but Arsenalstole in to get him for £60mplus £7.5m in add-ons. They had held the upper hand over Spurs all summer in that Eze always preferred to go to them, having supported them as a kid and played for their academy between the ages of eight and 13. But Arteta suggested it was dramatic and “one of the fastest” transfers in the end.Eze was presented to the Emirates Stadium crowd before Saturday’s5-0 win over Leeds,which featured an assured debut from the 15-year-old midfielder Max Dowman, who came on as a 64th-minute substitute, but was marred by injuries to Martin Ødegaard (shoulder) and Bukayo Saka (hamstring).“I think he [Eze] has the capacity to create these magic moments,” Arteta said. “He’s got that flair, that charisma that is very contagious. We know he can play as an attacking midfielder, right or left. He doesn’t care. He plays shifted off the left, as well. I’m sure we will find the right place for him.”Saka’s injury appeared to be more serious than that of the captain and the timing is bad, with Arsenal going to Liverpool next Sunday. “For Bukayo to come off, for sure it looks like something that is significant,” Arteta said. “He felt something in his hamstring while he was sprinting.

The defender Jurriën Timber also scored twice. Saka got the other one.“Max has zero hesitation,” Arteta said. “He’s so convinced that he can go at 15 and deliver that, which I’ve never witnessed in my life.

The manager said: “He made a good first game and I decided to continue.“When I take decisions in the first part of the season – for all the players you play one or two [games] – everyone thinks: ‘OK, this is the starting lineup.’ It was just today I decided that.”Brennan Johnson had opened the scoring and while City had chances their performance was disjointed. Guardiola said: “We missed the simple things. The effort and running is extraordinary and I have no doubts about that.“We created chances, we created enough. It happened, it’s football. It’s just the second game.

Goals from Josh Cullen, newly installed as captain, and Jaidon Anthony mean they are already halfway to that tally, while Sunderland were given a harsh lesson in the reality of the top flightafter their opening winagainst West Ham.Cullen’s predecessor, Josh Brownhill, was instrumental in bringingBurnleyup and his replacement set the tone with a fine opener and an assist for the second. Turf Moor was clearly nervous from the off, with memories of earning 10 points here two seasons ago fresh in the mind. The victory was hard-earned through discipline, graft and one of the few moments of quality in the 90 minutes to offer hope that this time may be different for Burnley after becoming a yo-yo club.Arsenal v Leeds: Premier League – liveRead moreScott Parker, the Burnley manager, said: “I’m absolutely buzzing, first and foremost, for the players and for the fans and everyone involved. We were brilliant.“The main thing for our first home game, we needed to make these fans believe. We need to make them feel or illustrate to our fans what we’re capable of this year. Our fans were superb. Our players gave them that belief. They’re going to be vitally important this year.“As a football club, I can’t do this on my own. These 20, 30-odd players can’t do this on their own. It’s going to need the whole club to support, to get behind us, to buckle in at times for the bumpy road and the challenge we face.”Survival will be built on what happens in home games.

The defence had a summer shake-up and looked fragile inlast week’s loss at Tottenhamand they should have been behind within five minutes here.Granit Xhaka’s free-kick found Dan Ballard, who knocked the ball down to Eliezer Mayenda to shoot from close range, only for Martin Dubravka produce a fine save from a miscue.

A direct ball was won by Anthony and then Lyle Foster got the better of the substitute Jenson Seelt, before beating Robin Roefs. The goal music blared, Foster ran to the corner to celebrate and did not hear Michael Salisbury’s whistle, the referee having deemed the South African had fouled the defender.If the first half was devoid of quality, the tenor changed within two minutes of the second. Quilindschy Hartman, who goes by Q in these parts, collected a loose pass on the left and drilled it into Anthony, whose perfect flick found Cullen and the Burnley captain curled the ball into the bottom corner from 15 yards. The video assistant referee tried to ruin the fun with a strangely lengthy check for an offside that never was.

There was, however, cause for worry soon after when the floodlights kept flashing and the game was stopped as it was causing a distraction on the pitch because it is not traditional to have a mid-match lights show.Burnley were always there to pressure opponents and put bodies on the line. Chasing lost causes and pressing those in black was a key trait to the end, aided by the experience of Kyle Walker and relentless energy provided by Hannibal Mejbri. The performance was summed up by Maxime Estève going down with cramp after making a critical interception. It meantSunderlandwere not afforded a chance to equalise.“It’s not a surprise for me, it’s not a surprise for the players, for the club,” Régis Le Bris, the visiting manager, said of the Premier League’s quality. “I don’t know for the fans, I’m not sure, because they know how tough this league is. You enjoy when you win, but you won’t be too negative when you lose.”It was the foundations that were tested more than the electricity supply with two minutes remaining. With Sunderland chasing the match, there was space to be enjoyed for once and Cullen flashed a sublime pass through the defence for Anthony to latch on to, before rounding the goalkeeper and finishing. Sometimes it is better to be good than lucky.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBurnleySunderlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Gimmers of promises. Green shoots. It is indicative of just how far Manchester United have sunk that the reaction to their1-0 defeat to Arsenallast Sunday was not shock or scorn or even schadenfreude; it was encouragement. United used to inspire fear in opponents; now they inspire pity.It is not that there were no reasons for optimism for United. The new forwards who started, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, looked intermittently dangerous. Mason Mount offered a reminder of his quality and if he can stay fit he could have a major role to play. Patrick Dorgu dominated his flank. Amad Diallo sparkled after coming off the bench. David Raya was forced to make seven saves. Dorgu hit a post. There were plausible claims for a penalty when William Saliba appeared to go through the back of Cunha. Opta’s xG model had United winning 1.5 to 1.3.Manchester United close on signing Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens in €20m dealRead moreFans looking for crumbs of comfortcould have found enough to make a decent meal for a small bird. After months of United being terrible, they looked OK. But they still lost. Already they are three points behind the leaders and, given the context, there is inevitably already pressure. It is probably just as well they face Fulham away on Sunday, because Fulham away is as near to a sure thing as there is for United these days. Not since 2009 have Fulham beaten Manchester United at home. They have managed one draw in the nine games. Craven Cottage is the one ground where United can feel safe, a time capsule in which Alex Ferguson still glowers from the dugout, Roy Keane still dominates the midfield and Ryan Giggs still speeds down the wing.United need to win. If they do not,Ruben Amorimwill be back to having the worst win percentage of any United manager since Herbert Bamlett, whose contract was not renewed after relegation in 1931. In some ways that is a quirk, a freak stat that does not take into account the weirdness of last season. But it is also a reminder of just how bad United have been under Erik ten Hag’s successor. There is no credit in the bank. To believe that Amorim is the right manager for United is an act of faith.That is not to say that it is misplaced; Amorim looked a very impressive manager at Sporting and he inherited an extremely difficult situation. But it does perhaps explain why there has been such eagerness to magnify the few fragments of optimism from the opening game of the season.The risk United are taking is enormous. Amorim is a fundamentalist. He will only play one way. 3-4-2-1 is the one true faith and there can be no deviation from that. United’s squad when he arrived was a hodgepodge accumulated over the reigns of six managers, with few common characteristics other than their mutual unfamiliarity with 3-4-2-1. Some will adapt, but many of the playing personnel will have to be replaced, a major overhaul to suit a manager who may by Sunday night have the worst win percentage at the club in almost a century.Burnley at home a week later offers a further opportunity for United to get points on the board, gain confidence and bolster faith in Amorim before the much more testing business of the Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium, straight after the international break.View image in fullscreenBryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha looked intermittently dangerous for Manchester United against Arsenal.Photograph: Matt McNulty/Getty ImagesPerhaps the £200m attacking combination of Benjamin Sesko, Cunha and Mbeumo can drive United forward. The absence of European football should help. But Sunday also demonstrated United’s many shortcomings.NeitherAltay Bayindir nor André Onanahave offered any suggestion they can be aconsistent high-level Premier League goalkeeper. United, more generally, have a major problem dealing with inswinging set-plays. If United can ever offload one of the many players they have made clear have no future at the club to create profitability and sustainability regulations headroom, and Gianluigi Donnarumma is available and interested for a knockdown price, he surely must be a priority.Leny Yoro has shown sufficient promise that it is possible to think he will be the first senior arrivalto get definitively better after joining Unitedsince Ashley Young and David De Gea signed in the same week in 2011. Cases could be made for Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot, but they have probably done little more than maintain their level – achievement enough in the Old Trafford permacrisis. Nonetheless, it is far from clear who Yoro’s most effective partners are. Matthijs de Ligt has never convinced since leaving Ajax. Lisandro Martínez has been unfortunate with injuries, as has Luke Shaw over a much longer period. Harry Maguire, his demeanour increasingly that of a put-upon husband from an 80s sitcom, is as much an emergency late-game striker these days as a central defender. Ayden Heaven is inexperienced.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Amorim seems convinced by the idea of Fernandes as one of the deep-lying players, but if that is to have a chance of working he needs an aggressive and industrious ball-winner alongside him. Casemiro no longer has the energy, while Manuel Ugarte, who played in a similar role for Sporting, has never come close to adapting to the pace and physicality of the Premier League, his loss of confidence reflected in some bizarre decision-making in the defeat against Arsenal.But the issue of Amorim’s dogmatism is not just that of the struggle to find players to fit. It is also of the sense of wastage, those players United have who have no obvious role in the 3-4-2-1. Is Amad, with his skittering feet and remarkable left foot, really best served operating as a right-wingback? And what of Kobbie Mainoo, prodigiously gifted, still only 20, a starter for England in the Euros final last summer, but not a natural fit for any role in Amorim’s system?How much faith do United have in Amorim? Enough to sideline Mainoo’s talents? Enough to carry on the overhaul of the squad to his specifications, even though that could take a further three or four windows? Enough to keep plodding through the wilderness, extolling every wisp of positivity in the belief the promised land will at some point be reached?

I felt like my arm was shutting down a little bit when I was hitting forehands and on the serve. It kind of got progressively worse. Then on the grass it got quite painful. So I didn’t know what I was dealing with.“After the grass, I got it checked out. I had some bone stress, bone bruising, in my humerus on my left side. It is one of those where, if you keep playing with it, it could become very, very serious. So I had to take some time out. Saying that, it was not so bad, because I could obviously do a lot of other things as well physically. It wasn’t like I had to stop completely.”Although he was in pain at times during the grass season, Draper does not believe the injury played any role in his Wimbledon loss, which he said was purely down to his struggles to adapt to the surface.“It’s an injury which takes time to heal,” said Draper. “A bone can heal, but it might be giving me some discomfort, that’s for sure. It’s not something which I’m going to go out on Monday and feel like it’s holding me back at all. But at the same time, I have been looking after this for the last month or so, so I’m looking forward to just getting back to competing. I think that will take my mind off a lot of things.

Just when Tommy Fleetwood looked to have a firm grip on this Tour Championship, Cantlay emerged from the shadows in a bid to become the third member of the US Ryder Cup contingent in the course of this season to deny Fleetwood the win he is long overdue on American soil. It feels poetic that Cantlay was front and centre as Fleetwood and Europe triumphed over the US in Rome two years ago. If it is to be Tommy’s time, he will have to scrap for it. Cantlay might be in his home country but so many of the Atlanta gallery will root for the hugely popular Fleetwood on day four.Cantlay birdied four of his last five holes at East Lake to produce a back nine of 31 in an overall 64. Cantlay’s 16 under par topped Fleetwood until the Southport golfer rolled in a birdie putt from 10ft at the 17th. Fleetwood’s 67 meant he is tied at the leaderboard summit with Cantlay, 18 holes from home.Keegan Bradley agonising over whether to be a playing Ryder Cup captain for USRead moreFleetwood rattled off four birdies in succession from the 5th to endorse the sense this is finally his American time. East Lake jabbed back at the 15th, where Fleetwood found water from the tee before slipping to a double bogey five. Fleetwood’s response was excellent, courtesy of shots collected at the 16th and 17th before his fairway wood to the last drifted into a greenside bunker. Sixteen under plays 16 under. There is a two-shot gap to Russell Henley in third.“You want to be in the final group on Sunday or you want to be in contention,” said Fleetwood. “I love the fact that I’m playing so well. I love the fact that I’m getting rewarded for my work by being in this position because we all grind so hard, we all practise so hard, but it’s been so long where you don’t get out of it what you put in.Golfjust isn’t like that.“I love that I’m up there again, and it’s just another chance. It’s another opportunity. It’s another day where I get to go out and do what I love and enjoy it and be in contention and just go and hit the golf shots. We’re trying to win a golf tournament and do something very special.”View image in fullscreenOn the charge: Patrick Cantlay’s round of 64 left him with a share of the lead.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPACantlay has already virtually assured he will be a Ryder Cup captain’s pick on Wednesday but glory here would further justify that position. Bradley’s upcoming Ryder Cup decision is getting harder by the day. The US captain, who must choose whether or not he also wants to play at Bethpage, posted a 63 to leap to 13 under. Strange though it may seem for a qualifying process which lasts two years, Bradley’s final day performance feels hugely significant. Should he win or even come close to claiming the Tour Championship, he is surely set to become the first playing captain in the Ryder Cup since Arnold Palmer in 1963.“I caught myself on the range today thinking about something I wanted to tell the team at Bethpage and it happens to me throughout the round,” Bradley explained. “I see a guy at the leaderboard and I remember who we’re thinking of pairing him with and it’s great that they’re playing good, or I wish they were a little higher, whatever it is. It’s been a wild year. I’m just trying to tackle what’s in front of me, and I think I’ve done a good job of that. This might be my best round of the year, which I’m really proud of.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s what the pamphlets don’t tell youEmily ThompsonThe hospital gave me a stack of helpful information when I was first diagnosed last Christmas. But they didn’t tell me to bring spare underwear to workSign up for the Rural Network email newsletterSat 23 Aug 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 23 Aug 2025 20.38 EDTShareI’m 45 years old and currently battling cancer. A few weeks ago, I threw up at work with such force that I peed myself. My first thought was: the treatment pamphlets tell you to sip peppermint tea and keep a fan at your desk for nausea, but nowhere did they mention you might find yourself in the staff bathroom vomiting so hard you become incontinent. If they had, I’d have popped a spare pair of undies in my work bag.I was diagnosed just before Christmas last year. It was a complete shock: I was 44 and the healthiest I’d been in years. At first, I was given an excellent prognosis, and after the initial shock, I rallied like never before. I decided I was going to face this head-on, full of positive energy.But after surgery and pathology, the language shifted. They started using the word “good” instead of “excellent”, and we realised this was going to be more of a fight. I gathered as much information as I could, along with every resource available, determined to be prepared. But nobody told me about the messy parts.Sweaty and flustered, my breast cancer patient was experiencing hot flushes. The lack of good treatment is frustrating | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreAfter speaking to some fellow cancer warriors, I’ve compiled a list of the advice I wish I’d been given at the start.1. You don’t have to follow the adviceAt one of your initial appointments, you will be handed a tonne of information from theCancerCouncil, and most of it is solid gold. But you don’t have to do everything that’s recommended. This is a shock, and I’m sorry it’s happened to you, and it’s OK to do this your way. I started by sharing everything publicly and was overwhelmed with wonderful support. Nine months in and I’ve retreated into myself and don’t want to talk to anyone about it. Both are OK. My oncology counsellor told me to stick to my normal schedule as much as possible and not to give cancer more power than it already has. This was fine until recently when I had to cut back hours at work. I’m not giving cancer power, however – I’m giving my body the rest it needs.2. Give your body what it needsRight now I need rest,nutritious meals when I can handle them, sunlight and movement. There’s new research that suggestsexercise plays a vital rolein cancer treatment, and it’s encouraged where possible. Personally, I find it improves my mood, gets me outside and helps me feel I’m taking a proactive step towards health. Likewise, I spoke to a fellow cancer warrior who explained that she loves juicing – each day she will head to the fruit market and carefully choose her fruits and vegetables. She explained she understands that juice is probably doing nothing for her cancer, but it’s not bad for her and helps her feel proactive. I’m not into juice, but after speaking with her, I now have salad for lunch every day. My daily bowl of rainbow veggies isn’t a cure, but it is a ritual that feels as though I’m telling cancer to fuck off.Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter3. Your body will change in unexpected waysYou might pee yourself when you spew – look, it happens. Chemotherapy in particular will mess with your digestive system and you will immediately map out the toilets of any public space you are in. You might lose your hair – everywhere. Losing your nasal hair means your nose will run constantly. Losing your pubic hair makes you fart really loudly. Steroids make you pack on weight; other medications will strip it off frighteningly fast.4. Cancer hurts, and some of that pain is financialI have stopped working full-time and we are so very broke right now. My diagnosis coincided with the cost-of-living crisis, so we’ve never needed a second income more. And cancer is expensive. It’s not as bulk billed as you would expect – the fine needle biopsy used to diagnose my cancer cost $380 after the Medicare rebate. The medical costs add up quickly.5. You will become your own best advocateSure, you should find a knowledgable medical team who has your best interests at heart, but you know your body best. If something doesn’t feel right, keep pushing until it’s paid attention to. It’s OK to demand that scan, try a different medication and to discuss treatment options. You are not difficult. You deserve solutions.6. You will lose friends and gain unexpected onesThere’s this idea that challenging times “show us who our real friends are” but that’s not the case at all. Cancer is a lot, and not everyone can take this journey with you. It doesn’t make them bad people, it’s just that life is heavy for everyone and they don’t currently have space for you. But the people who stay with you will hold you up in ways you never knew you’d need, and you’ll make new friends too.7. Cancer is a rollercoasterLots of metaphors work, but this one is the best. The sudden jolting start, the highs, the lows, the speed increase and decrease and the twist you didn’t see coming. All of this is geared to get you to the exit: remission or NED – no evidence of disease. But here’s what you didn’t know: if you’re lucky you can get off the rollercoaster, but you can’t ever leave the amusement park. Every three, six, 12 months you have your scans and blood tests and see if you’re being dragged back on for another spin. I was thrown back on this year after a scan revealed new tumours, this time in my lung. I have lost the positivity that powered me through the first round. I’m not sharing as much because there’s nothing to say. It isn’t fair the first time, but the second time hits you where it hurts.‘It’s some sort of cosmic joke’: Tracy Sorensen wrote a book about surviving cancer. Now it has returnedRead more8. You aren’t aloneThere is so much help available. My family and friends, once they knew what was going on, cooked meals, grocery shopped, took care of our youngest and supported our eldest. I live in regional New South Wales and the charityCan Assisthas been a lifeline. They pay for all of my cancer medications, including my radiation meds, and will cover transport and accommodation costs when I have to travel to Sydney for treatment. Your local hospital should be able to point you in the direction of a social worker who will find all of these helpful options for you. There’s probably a support group near you – make use of it.9. You don’t have to stay positiveYou don’t have to be brave. You don’t have to be the best cancer patient and be liked and be an example to others. It’s OK to cry. Just make sure you reach out for help if it feels as if you are drowning in your tears.10. You won’t be the sameBut that’s not necessarily a bad thing. You will experience a loss of autonomy like never before. One moment my husband and I were discussing trying for a third baby, and the next I’m signing forms promising to not get pregnant for at least 12 months post radiation. But I’m stronger and surer of myself now, and I understand the fragility of life. I take fewer things for granted and prioritise my family over my career.The pamphlets can’t tell you all this. But those of us who’ve been on the ride can.And if you’ve just found yourself holding that ticket – pack the spare undies.

One afternoon when I was six, I watched a character give birth in an army tent in the sitcom M*A*S*H. I immediately rushed from the den into the kitchen with a very important question for my mother. “Did you give birth tomein a tent like that?” I blurted out, hoping to learn my origin story.Unexpectedly, my mother dashed from the room in tears. When she returned, she sat me down and broke the news I had somehow always known. “Your Uncle Ana brought you home from the hospital to Mommy and Daddy,” she said. “You’re adopted, which means we chose you.”I felt relieved to learn this truth, but as it upset my mom, I resolved never to bring it up again. Still, my thirst for details never waned. My parents and I had the same skin tone, but I didn’t muchlooklike them. I was awkward, gangly and bookish; they were not. Despite their love and acceptance, I had always felt like an alien in my family and could never put my finger on why.In the decades before Google, I was ill-equipped to track down information about my biological parents, especially because I was a minor and adoption records were then sealed in every US state. Shortly after I turned 18, though, I called the hospital where I was born to ask for my records. The clerk, initially warm, seemed puzzled that I didn’t know my last name at birth. After I admitted that I was adopted, a chill fell across the line.My records arrived in the mail a few weeks later, crisscrossed with thick black marker. The clerk had blocked out every trace of personal information: my birth mother’s name, birth date, address and details about her hospital stay. The redacted records reinforced a sense of erasure. I stuffed them away, and tried to move on.Years later, as a journalist adept at digging up information about practically anyone and anything, I continued to hit dead ends when it came to learning more about my biological mother. Then, when I was 35, I used part of a tax refund to hire a private investigator to try to find her contact details. He tracked her down quickly: she was a marine attorney living in Connecticut. Elated and fantasising about a joyful mother-daughter reunion, I quickly fired off a letter, gently suggesting she was my mother and asking for medical history and ethnicity details.My dream turned out to be just that: a fantasy. My birth mother replied, but not in the way I had hoped. In attorney-like fashion, she’d neither confirm nor deny I was the baby she had given up on that late July day, but implied it with her words. “I don’t want to think back on that experience,” she wrote, adding that information about my existence could be “greatly damaging” to her.Her email left me shaken. Surely she’d want to see the person I had become? I summoned the courage to request a photo and perhaps even lunch (we lived about three hours apart). But she insisted that I never contact her again.I didn’t know it at the time, but secondary rejection by a birth parent – when an attempt at reconnection with a birth family fails – is rare and considered a traumatic event, for which some adoptees seek therapeutic support. I dealt with the initial blow with long phone calls to friends and probably a little too much red wine. I didn’t have much time to ruminate, though – I was working towards a master’s degree and later that week headed off to a seminar with my professor at her New York City apartment.During an afternoon tea break, my professor’s partner, a judge, chatted with us at the counter of their cosy kitchen. With a brusque, direct communication style honed in New York City courtrooms, she asked about my life. I blurted out the events of the past few days and told her how I was finding it nearly impossible to focus.She listened intently. Then, as I imagined she might do in court, she began rapid-fire questioning. “When were you born?” she asked. The early 1970s, I told her. “And your mother, was she Catholic?” “Yes,” I replied, “from an Irish Catholic family. One of seven, I think.”“And she was young, probably?”“Yeah – 19, I think.”She paused. “You know, I’m just about the same age as your birth mother,” she said. “It might be hard for you to understand, especially now, but back then it was tough for an Irish-Catholic girl who became pregnant outside marriage.”I almost choked on my tea. Was she really defending my biological mother? My birth mother who was rejecting meagainout of shame, cruelty or both? “I didn’t know that,” I admitted. “But it doesn’t excuse her actions. She’s in her 50s, for goodness sake.”Undeterred, the judge explained how pregnant Catholic girls were often sent away to conceal their pregnancies and save face for their families. How the stigma could be overwhelming. She reminded me that abortion was illegal at the time, and Roe v Wade (the decision that legalised abortion in the US) was still a few months off.As we placed our mugs in the sink, she urged me to try to see the situation through another lens, if only for my own peace of mind. “What’s done is done,” she said. “You are alive, and you have the rest of your life ahead of you.” Now that I knew the truth, the only way forward was through.For weeks, I clung to my sense of injustice. Perhaps I had grown attached to the bewildering primal wound I’d carted around since childhood. Like many adoptees, I had long been unable to explain why I felt displaced. Now, I had proof. But if trauma and shame are generational continuums, how do we break the cycle?Over the ensuing months and years, I realised the judge had thrown me a lifeline of sorts. What she said that afternoon had planted seeds of compassion for a woman I could have easily grown to resent. It had blunted the edges of what might have festered into lifelong bitterness, and it fuelled an enduring empathy I’ve applied in many situations since.Her words also became a salve when I was rejected again by a biological uncle, after we were connected by a DNA test. And they were a shot of confidence when I sought and eventually found my biological father’s family – all of whom welcomed me with open arms and not an ounce of hesitation. Above all, the judge’s words in the kitchen that long-ago day allowed me to let go of the need for perfect answers – and make space for imperfect endings.Corin Hirsch is a writer who covers food, drink and travelExplore more on these topicsAdoptionWords that changed everythingFamilyChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

His office has ramped up social media attacks on Donald Trump, his policies, and, predictably, his bugnuts tweeting. I have witnessed the rise of Gavin Newsom firsthand: from his tenure as mayor of San Francisco to the governorship of my state to thisdeeply embarrassing photowith afuture resident of Mar-a-Lago. At last, the world can finally see the Gavin Newsom I have come to vehemently tolerate – a man with a tendency to stumble into doing the right thing in the most annoying way possible.Newsom is the kind of politician who will seize the moment – legalizing same-sex marriage in San Francisco back in 2004, most significantly – as long as the moment is somewhere near a camera and an operating microphone. We are in one of those dreaded “moments” right now, as Texas gerrymanders itself to rig the midterms in the favor of Republicans. Newsom is taking full advantage,pushing to gerrymander California in responseand turning over one of his office’s social media accounts to run a comic offensive against the White House. In the process, he is doing the thing I hate the most: weaponizing nostalgia.Trump’s presidential philosophy is government by shakedown | Steven GreenhouseRead moreNostalgia is a powerful thing, like a rank body odor or a French cheese. Don’t we all love turning back the hands of time and pretending like we still have all our hair, we can stand for more than 30 minutes of an Oasis concert and Twitter is a thing that matters to normal people? Remember 2017? That was a fun year. The Women’s March, the release of the original Nintendo Switch, and Montenegro joining Nato (ugh, finally). It was certainly a year, was it not? Definitely one of the years. Back then, not a minute would go by without aKrassenstein brothertelling you that the indictments were imminent, that Donald Trump was a lame duck and thepee tapewas just an Amazon Prime delivery away. Robert Mueller was practically Elvis gyrating on the Ed Sullivan Show, he was so beloved by neurotic liberals trying their best to white-knuckle through the first Trump administration. Sometimes, I’ll put on the music video forDespacitoand just vibe on the 2017 of it all. You probably don’t even remember that song exists, but I assure you, it was popular once.Back in those days, we all thought we could mock Trump into oblivion. I certainlytried. Idefinitely failed. But thinking we could tease the man into appeasement was an amusing fantasy. Our first go-round with the Don was something of a satire boom – the Daily Show, the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, digital outlets like Crooked Media. Surely all we’d need to do is make fun of his tan and he’d go away, like a schoolyard bully with a weird birthmark. Despite the best efforts of various Ivy League educated wits, Trump won out with crueler insults, more banal observations and performative intimidation tactics that energized his base. We are now almost a decade into the Trump era and no one on the left has been able to figure out how to cause lasting damage to the Maga mystique that doesn’t involve the Jeffrey Epstein files. So, when I witness the numbing onslaught of Newsom’s@GovPressOfficeaccount, I can’t help but be caught in a reverie that warps me back to the halcyon days of something resembling optimism – when “the resistance” was a hashtag that seemed to have actual meaning.@GovPressOffice is a glorious throwback to 2017. Also, 2018. And 2019. And 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Kamala Harris even tried this same tactic,trolling Trump on social mediaas often as possible. In the minds of the most die-hard political junkies, platforms like X are the ultimate battleground, where hearts and minds can be won over with a bit of sarcasm or a meme ofJD Vance as a baby. At most, that mememight get you deported, but I’m still not convinced it can sway an election. Nevertheless, they persisted. It seems like any Democrat with a shred of national recognition immediately goes into full 2017 “resistance” mode, hoping to trigger the right into some mythical unforced error of political gamesmanship. Please indulge me as I copy/paste an actual tweet from @GovPressOffice. Decide for yourself if you think this is going to sway a voter to move to the left:WOW!!! MY MAPS (THE BEST MAPS EVER MADE) WILL SOON PASS IN THE GREATEST LEGISLATURE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD (NOT JUST AMERICA). AMERICA CAN THANK ME (GAVIN C. NEWSOM) AND TWO VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE – MAGIC MIKE & RAINMAKER ROBERT, WHO LEAD THE LEGISLATURE – TOTAL LEGENDS!!! THESE ARE “PERFECT, BEAUTIFUL” MAPS. BETTER THAN COLUMBUS, BETTER THAN GOOGLE MAPS, BETTER THAN APPLE MAPS (SORRY TIM, NO GOLD BAR FOR ME, BUT I STILL LOVE YOU!). PEOPLE ARE ALREADY SCREAMING “MAMA! MAMA!” AND I SAY, “NO, I AM YOUR DADDY!!!” THE GOLDEN ERA BEGINS IN THE GOLDEN STATE, ALL BECAUSE OF ME, THE PEOPLE’S GOVERNOR, THE CARTOGRAPHER-IN-CHIEF, WHO WILL NOW LET THE PEOPLE VOTE!!! THANK YOU, USA!!! – GCNIf I might go fullr/PeterExplainsTheJokehere, the bit above revolves around the Newsom account mimicking Trump’s tendency to post witless threats and self-aggrandizements in all-caps. Meanwhile, the actual Trump, on his own social media platform, posts strictly within his own version of reality, where deploying the military in Washington DC magically stopped crime, Democrats are twirling their mustaches while plotting to rig elections and the Governor of California is named “Gavin Newscum.” Not even a clever nickname. He foolishly left “Goofy Gavin”, “Blabbin Gavin”, and “Gavin Nonuts” on the table, but no one in the Maga base cares if he’s actually funny, if he has anything witty to say. They like Trump because he’s authentically Trump. He is a fully realized cartoon man impervious to South Park episodes, name-calling and garden variety teasing. Half of the Harris 2024 social media strategy revolved around JD Vance making love to a sofa, but that didn’t translate into actual votes. I guess I can have a mild chuckle in between huffs of misery fumes at the depression factory that is 2025 America.This is not to say that Newsom is a worthless twit who has succeeded because of (and in some ways despite) his beautiful head of hair. No, he’s not worthless. Theredistricting planhe’s enacted here in California is the only reasonable response to the escalation coming from the right. But what is gained from parody? What does mimicry do for the Democrats? It’s just another instance of the other side reinforcing the notion that Trump dictates the terms of engagement. There is a middle ground between “when they go low, we go high” capitulation and “lol I called myself the ‘CARTOGRAPHER IN CHIEF.’” In order to claw back authority and respectability, the Democrats have to stop trying to be Trump and start trying to be something else. Something coherent. Something relatable. Needling Trump is a great way to get engagement, to guarantee clicks and attention. Believe me, I know. But I’m not the governor of California. I’m basically a less successful, long-lost Krassenstein brother hoping to cash in on #resistance. Until the left figures out how to be something other than a pale shadow of their opponent, we’ll keep wishing it was still 2017.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsGavin NewsomOpinionDonald TrumpXcommentShareReuse this content"

Nothing really against those South Park guys – I’ve caught plenty of episodes over its astonishing near-30-year run, and loved the 1999 big-screen movie. But while I haven’t always maintained clockwork viewership of The Simpsons, either, those characters have proved durable enough to revive my interest in episodes old and new. South Park has a thinner bench by comparison, and as the show itself astutely pointed out years ago, it’s difficult for a satirically minded animated sitcom to explore ground that The Simpsons hasn’t covered already. South Park’s political bent, too, has often seemed less varied than the warmer (but still sometimes cutting) social ribbing of Matt Groening’s signature show. It’s a fine line between omnidirectional satire and libertarian crankiness.And yet the27th season of South Parkhas accomplished something vanishingly few of its peers, whether in animation or topical comedy, have been able to do: getting laughs taking shots at the secondTrump administration. It’s not that the White House is beyond reproach. Quite the opposite problem, much-documented: theDonald Trumpcabal is so outsized in its stupidity and cruelty that it’s hard to distend it into a “funny” caricature, even a bleak one. In Trump’s second term, it has only gotten bleaker; jokes that were worn out by the end of 2020 are getting retold with a nasty vengeance, and the bar for cathartic laughter has been raised considerably.Satire at its finest: South Park takes on Trump’s martial takeover, AI and tech brosRead moreFor a comedy fan, this winds up translating to an aversion. The occasional shots taken by The Simpsons somehow don’t land as squarely as they did when aimed at presidents I liked much, much more. I watchSaturday Night Liveevery week, and mostly dread James Austin Johnson’s accurate but ultimately defangedimpression. (Some weeks, Johnson himself seems bummed out to be doing it.) I respect the hell out of Stephen Colbert, but I have never sought out his Trump commentary; I don’t need any more clapter – the reaction encouraged by comedy that wants your approval more than your laughter – in my life. South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone seemed to agree; Parker’s 2017 announcement that they’d grown bored of taking shots at Trump – then barely into his first presidential term – was one of the show’smany controversiesover the years.So how is it that South Park’s revived anti-Trump blows this season have managed to land? A big part of it is precisely Stone and Parker’s allergy to clapter and the grandstanding that inspires it. They obviously resent anything they read as putting on airs and sometimes in the past, this came across as its own form of preachiness, with “everybody chill”-style speeches at an episode’s end that would secretly sound just as prescriptive as the self-righteousness they wanted to send up. With their most recent Trump parody, though, there isn’t much moralizing – just gratifyingly mean caricatures of deserving figures such as Trump,JD Vanceand homeland security secretaryKristi Noem. Some (not all) of their past roastings have verged on point-and-laugh bullying; here are targets worthy of that derision.Some of this derision speaks through the language of South Park itself. Trump isn’t vocally or visually imitated; he’s depicted in a series of repurposed photos, with the same voice and animation technique that Parker and Stone used to bring Saddam Hussein to life in the South Park movie. He’s also given the same sexual partner: amuscled-up and put-upon version of Satan, who has found himself in another toxic relationship. Calling Trump a wannabe dictator doesn’t break new ground, but there’s something satisfying in Stone and Parker using their personal toolkit to draw a line between Trump and Hussein; if they thought it was a histrionic comparison, they’d be making fun of it instead of making it. Similarly, there’s real spite animating the depiction of Noem as adog-murderingzealot whose glamorous face needs to be repeatedly lacquered and reaffixed to her head as she commands an army of Immigration and Customs Enforcement thugs.Lewd, crude and politically astute: South Park’s history of controversyRead moreNot all of the season’s satire has involved making real-life figures regulars on the show. Because South Park’s ensemble has rarely felt as vast or believably developed as Springfield of The Simpsons (or even Arlen on King of the Hill), it’s also flexible enough to turn Randy, Stan’s desperately trend-following dad, into a ketamine-microdosing, tech-bro moron addicted to the soothing, empty reassurances of ChatGPT – the focus ofthe most recent episode, to the point where most of the core child cast doesn’t appear. Surprisingly, this season has deployed forever favorite Cartman more sparingly so far, again getting self-referential in the season’s second episode, where the id-driven and arguably evil little kid is incensed to find out that podcasters have stolen his “shtick” – his pervasive hatefulness, repackaged as a challenge to debate where the aggressor is always the self-appointed winner. Ascribing this “master debater” title to Cartman (alongside a fellow kid serving as an obvious Charlie Kirk/Ben Shapiro stand-in) somehow manages to make this ridiculous behavior funny in its petty smallness without glorifying it.A South Park diehard would probably describe this praise as a fair-weather fan only enjoying the show when it goes after the “right” targets. Maybe that’s true, but it’s also a lot easier to take some joy in savaging Vance as a meme-faced version of a Fantasy Island sidekick than, say, accusing George Lucas and Steven Spielberg of cultural rape. It’s probably wishful thinking to wonder if Parker and Stone might actually move the needle of the perception on tech bros, debate-me podcasters and Trump-world ghouls, especially among the dude demo. But it’s also just a blessed change of pace to see say-anything, first-amendment types finding a fresher target than the wokeness bogeyman. While countless standups continue to whine about being silenced, Parker and Stone seem highly aware of their rarified position (and, asParamountcontractors, alsoawareof what actual political-corporateinterferencelooks like). In a world where Trump’s actual political opponents seem terrified to actually fight him, some well-deserved, point-and-laugh meanness has become a surprising novelty.Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkAnimation on TVTV comedyComedyTelevisionUS televisionDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Which is criminal when there is so much we could doSat 23 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 23 Aug 2025 12.33 EDTShareLots of people told me to not study languages – including my own (monolingual) dad. “You’re never going to be as fluent as a native speaker,” I remember him saying when I was deciding on my university degree. “Why bother?”A little more than a decade later, I’ve collected a wealth of experiences. I’ve staffed Sotheby’s Madrid reception desk, I’ve taught theatre and English to Syrian children excluded from mainstream schools in Beirut. I’ve given a speech on sustainable development goals for Arab audiences at the UN, and I’ve trained journalists in Ecuador’s most dangerous city. I’ve dated men I’ve wanted to, swatted off men who I didn’t, sung songs, cooked recipes, all in languages that are not my native tongue. And most important of all? I’ve changed my dad’s mind.Nick Gibb, the former schools minister, was right this week whenhe told the Timesthat the UK’s decline in language-learning is “damaging to our reputation as a global player”. Our international counterparts are far more multilingual than us; in Europe, we areamong the least likelyto speak a second language. Brits were not always poor language learners – in 1997, we reached ahigh pointwhere 82% of boys and 73% of girls were entered for a modern language at GCSE – but by 2018,that had sunkto 50% of all girls, and only 38% of boys.More democratised access to language-learning – once the preserve of elites, like Etonians and the accomplished young ladies Jane Austen loved writing about – had been under way for most of the 20th century, but it was soured by the fact that language GCSEs were hard. To this day, they are consistently gradedmore severelythan other subjects.But rather than marking exams more generously, challenging the perception that language exams are too onerous, or better equipping schools with higher quality language teaching, the 2004 Labour government decided the solution was to eliminate the requirement to take a language GCSE altogether. It has had a catastrophic effect on language-learning ever since.Some languages are weathering the ensuing collapse in interest better than others;Spanish take-up is healthy and growing, while French appears to be stabilising after a big drop. German entries at GCSE are falling rapidly despite itbeing the most-requested language in UK job ads.Worse, we appear to be going back in time, where language-learning is once again becoming the preserve of the elite; the percentage of year 11 pupils studying a language at GCSE in poorer areassits at around 46-47%compared to affluent areas, which stand a whole 20 percentage points higher.Inevitably, lower language uptake at GCSE triggers an ongoing cave-in among A-levels and university degrees. Even though more people are going to university than ever before, UK applications for undergraduate language degrees have gone down by more than a fifth in the last six years. Universities – especially post-1992 ones – keeplosing their modern languages departments. NeitherBrexitnorthe pandemicwill have helped, curtailing possibilities connected with studying abroad.I was fortunate to go to a school that prioritised languages, but I was even luckier to benefit from exposure to multilingualism, something thatresearch has recently suggestedmakes pupils in England far more motivated to study languages, even when they live in monolingual areas. Where my dad saw little value, my mum – fluent in Italian and the minority language variety my nonna brought with her when she emigrated here from the Ligurian Apennines in the 1950s – encouraged me to add as many languages to my roster as possible.Without the Spanish I started learning as a 13-year-old, the Arabic I started as an 18-year-old and the Italian that has hovered in and out of my life since birth, I wouldn’t be the journalist or person I am today. That’s not only because of the conversations I’ve been able to have or the sources I’ve been able to read; it’s because of the formative life experiences that accompany language-learning. The reason languages are so desired among employers isn’t just for the words and grammar, but because of the soft skills that come with accumulating them – the resilience, the creative thinking, and the openness to new ideas that is demanded of you when you immerse yourself into different cultures.Multilingual people gain access to all of the jobs that require such skills, as well as the cognitive benefits associated with everything from enhanced creativity to possiblydelaying the impacts of Alzheimer’s. Any Britons who assume they can rely on English alone when travelling quickly have that belief dismantled when forced into vulnerable situations abroad, or moments where they are hopelessly incapable of helping people at home. Earlier this summer, an elderly Portuguese woman on the Tube stopped me because she was lost trying to go to a hospital appointment. Unfortunately I only know how to say a smattering of dramaticfadolyrics and “I don’t speak Portuguese” – but my fluent Spanish meant we could understand each other, and I could tell her what stop to get off at.Despite a vague attempt to improve languages’ chances with the English baccalaureate in the 2010s, the situation in the UK has become so bad that the unhinged owl app Duolinguo is now trying to intervene, recently sponsoring a Westminster language-learning challenge getting politicians to out-nerd each other.So how do we resolve this issue?A recent thinktank reportmade immediate recommendations to hire more international language teachers to plug gaps and to keep language-learning as a statutory entitlement for pupils up to 18.I have additional ideas, beginning with better respecting the glittering diversity of languages emigrants bring to the UK. We wrongly dictate that assimilation in western countries requires shifting to English monolingualism, as opposed to developing sophisticated bilingualism across second, third and fourth generations. Leaning into more heritage language-learning opportunities, that both the UK government and international partners can collaborate on, would build international ties along with individuals’ connections to their families and communities.Accounting for our own indigenous languages would be a start, too;when Keir Starmer tweeted“If you want to live in the UK, you should speak English” this year, he ignored the language policies of our devolved nations that do not forget to accommodate Welsh, Gaelic and Scots.Combine the contribution immigrants make to our country with our ancient Celtic languages and one quickly realises the UK is not nearly as monolingual as we assume.Embracing multilingualismas a British trait would probably annoy or confound many. But – as I would relish explaining to you in the four languages I speak – that is precisely the reason why we should do it in the first place.Sophia Smith Galer is a journalist and content creator.

Later that day, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) notified his attorneys that he would be deported toUgandaand should report to immigration authorities on Monday.Kilmar Ábrego García released from criminal custody after court orderRead moreAccording toofficial documents posted online, the DHS told Ábrego’s attorneys on Friday afternoon that the “DHS may remove your client … to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends)”.Immigration and Customs Enforcement also directed Ábrego to report to its Baltimore office on Monday,according torecords posted online.Ábrego entered the US without permission in about 2011 as a teenager after fleeing gang violence. He was subsequentlyaffordeda federal protection order against deportation to El Salvador.The 30-year-old was initially deported by federal immigration officials in March. Though the Trump administration admitted that Ábrego’s deportation was an“administrative error”, officials have repeatedly accused him of being affiliated with the MS-13 gang, a claim Ábrego and his family vehemently deny.During his detention at El Salvador’s so-called Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), Ábrego was physically and psychologically tortured,according tocourt documents filed by his lawyers in July.Following Ábrego’s wrongful deportation, theTrump administrationfaced widespread pressure to return him to the US, including from a supreme court order that directed federal officials to “facilitate” his return.In June, the Trump administrationreturnedÁbrego from El Salvador, only to charge him with crimes related to human smuggling, which his lawyers have rejected as “preposterous”. His criminal trial is expected to begin in January.Before his deportation, Ábregohad livedin Maryland for more than a decade, working in construction while being married to an American wife.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those fears were somewhat allayed by a recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland, which requires immigration officials to allow Ábrego time to mount a defense.Separately, in a statement earlier this week, Uganda said that it agreed to a “temporary agreement” with the US to accept some asylum seekers who are deported from the country.Bagiire Vincent Waiswa, permanent secretary of Uganda’s foreign ministry,said: “The agreement is in respect of third country nationals who may not be granted asylum in the United States but are reluctant to or may have concerns about returning to their countries of origin.”Waiswa added: “This is a temporary arrangement with conditions including that individuals with criminal records and unaccompanied minors will not be accepted.

We’re long overdue an update. A four-day week with no loss of pay is about freedom – the freedom to live happier, healthier and more fulfilling lives.”The pandemic upended the world of work for many professionals, turninghybrid working into the “new normal”for more than a quarter of working adults in Great Britain, according to ONS figures.However, the continued tug-of-war between employers and their employees has meant some workers have had tobattle for the right to keep working from homein the face of return-to-office mandates, let alone reduce their number of working days.One local authority is leading the charge. South Cambridgeshire district councilvoted last month to permanently adopt a four-day week, becoming thefirst UK council to do so. Its 700 staff are able to opt in to the scheme, where they are expected to carry out 100% of their work in about 80% of their contracted hours, with no reduction in pay.Campaigners targeting dozens of UK councils in push for four-day weekRead moreAfter a 27-month trial, the council said it had recorded faster planning applications, housing repairs and benefits processing. In addition, it said it had improved staff motivation, reduced turnover and made an annual saving of nearly £400,000 by filling vacancies permanently rather than relying on expensive agency workers.It is understood several other councils are trialling a four-day week.South Cambridgeshire district council hadcome under pressure to drop its trial by the previous Conservative government, which issued guidance stating it did not support a four-day working week in local authorities and said it did “not believe that it delivers local taxpayers value for money”.However, the Labour governmentwithdrew the guidancein November. Instead, it said local authorities were “independent employers” who were “rightly responsible for the management and organisation of their own workforces”.Several senior Labour politicians, including the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, have voiced support for a four-day week, although the party has not embraced the policy since coming to power.The Scottish governmentlaunched a four-day week pilotin early 2024 and the results of the year-long trial involving two public sector bodies are expected to be published soon.Marketing and technology companies and charities havebeen in the vanguardof adopting four-day weeks so far, according to research by the 4 Day Week Foundation.Explore more on these topicsFour-day weekWork & careersWork-life balanceWorking from homeOffice for National StatisticsnewsShareReuse this content"

In a letter, she noted that two of the proposed embassy buildings in the drawings – the cultural exchange building and Embassy House – had been “greyed out”.She wrote to the planning consultancy in charge of the Chinese embassy proposal, asking it to “identify precisely and comprehensively” the drawings that had been redacted and explain the rationale and justification for the redactions.The consultancy responded earlier this week, saying it was “neither necessary nor appropriate” to provide full internal layout plans.In correspondence published by Luke de Pulford, the executive director of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance onChina, one of several parties that has objected to the embassy’s construction, the consultancy said: “The applicant considers the level of detail shown on the unredacted plans is sufficient to identify the main uses.”De Pulford said: “These explanations are far from satisfactory. The government set very few conditions and the Chinese didn’t even meet those. Now, to visit the abbey ruins, dissidents who want to visit will be on Chinese land, vulnerable to capture, out of the reach of UK authorities.”The Chinese embassy in the UK called on the government to “fulfil its obligation and approve the planning application without delay”.It said in a statement: “The planning and design of the new Chinese embassy project is of high quality, which has been well recognised by various professional bodies. The planning application has followed the customary diplomatic practices, as well as necessary protocol and procedures. In our reply to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, we have provided a comprehensive response to the questions concerning the planning application.“It is an international obligation of the host country to provide support and facilitation for the construction of diplomatic premises. Both China and the UK plan to build new embassies in each other’s capitals. The Chinese side urges the UK side to fulfil its obligation and approve the planning application without delay.”China bought the Royal Mint Court site for £255m in 2018, but its plans to build an embassy there stalled afterTower Hamlets council refused planning permission in 2022, citing security concerns and opposition from residents.The Conservative government declined to intervene butLabourtook the matter out of the council’s hands by calling it in soon after taking power last summer.The future of the embassy has become a major issue in diplomatic relations between the UK and China. The country’s president, Xi Jinping, raised it with Keir Starmer in their first phone call last August.The Guardian reported last yearthat China was blocking requests to rebuild the British embassy in Beijing while the fate of its embassy in London was being decided.Explore more on these topicsLondonChinaPlanning policyAngela RaynerLabourHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

The visit took place upon Wickremesinghe’s return from the G77 summit in Havana and the UN general assembly in New York.The offences carry a maximum punishment of 20 years in jail and an estimated fine of 16.6m rupees (£41,000).Wickremesinghe, who lost Sri Lanka’s last presidential election in September to the leftist leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, was said to be in stable condition after being brought to Colombo National hospital. The hospital’s deputy head, Rukshan Bellana, told the Agence France-Presse news agency that he had to be treated for acute dehydration. “He was a severe diabetic with high blood pressure when he was brought in,” Bellana said.Wickremesinghe became president in July 2022 after Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s resignation following months of protests driven by the country’s worst economic downturn since independence. Before assuming the presidency, Wickremesinghe, unpopular with protesters as he was seen as an ally of the Rajapaksa clan, hadbeen prime minister six timessince entering politics in 1977, though he never completed a term.In asignificant political shift for the countrylast September, Wickremesinghe was replaced by Dissanayake, the head of the leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party. The JVP has been tarred by its past involvement in some of the worst violence in the country’s history, and Dissanayake had sought to soften some of his party’s more hardline positions while attracting voters with promises to tackle corruption and abuses of power.Explore more on these topicsSri LankaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

But his face fell when he saw the dry, empty land in the village of Kampheko 2, where he had grown tomatoes, garlic, okra and maize.“It hurts,” he said through an interpreter. “It’s a distressing sight because water is life. So without water nothing can exist.”View image in fullscreenJulius Chibonda on the land where he lived for six months while trying to find enough water to support his agricultural entrepreneurship plans, in Chiganji, Malawi.Photograph: Rachel Savage/The GuardianMalawi is the world’s fourth poorest country per capita,according to the World Bank, with an average annual income of just $508 in 2024. More than 80% of the populationworks in agricultureand 90% of farming uses just rain without irrigation, according to theWorld Food Programme.That has made the landlocked southern African country particularly vulnerable to climate-fuelled disasters, including cyclones that have increased in intensity and frequency in recent years. In 2023, Cyclone Freddykilled more than 1,000Malawians.Since 2019, about 950,000 people have been displaced by cyclones, most temporarily, some multiple times. In a programme started in 2020, the government has helped 1,662 households (about 8,300 people) living in disaster-prone areas to relocate permanently, according to figures provided by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).The more gradual impacts of climate breakdown are also pushing people from their homes. Without concrete action, 216 million people worldwide could move internally by 2050 “due to slow-onset climate change impacts”, 86 million of them in sub-Saharan Africa, the World Bankestimated in 2021.View image in fullscreenPeople cross a makeshift bridge over flood water after Cyclone Freddy devastated Blantyre in 2023.Photograph: Jack Mcbrams/AFP/Getty ImagesIn 2023, African ministers signed a declaration on migration and the climate crisis, stating: “Migration can be a positive adaptation strategy if undertaken in a safe, orderly and regular manner.” But, it added that moving could exacerbate problems faced by already vulnerable groups.The World Bank forecasts for gradual climate migration did not include estimates for Malawi. But during adevastating droughtlast year, 400,000 people moved within the country, according to IOM data.Average temperatures in Malawi between 2015 and 2024 were 0.63 degrees higher than a century earlier, theWorld Bank data says. The rising population is also adding pressure – Malawi’s population hasmore than doubledto 21.6 million in 30 years.Local officials reported more people moving from southern Malawi to the north and centre of the country, said Master Simoni, who works for the IOM in the country.“As a result of the dry spells, we’ve seen that a lot of livelihood activities have been affected, be it farming, whether it’s crops or livestock, but also even casual labour,” he said.In a swath of the Mangochi and Ntcheu districts south of Lake Malawi, mud-walled villages were scattered off dirt tracks, amid scrubby trees and dried-up riverbeds. Small-scale farmers spoke about depleted water supplies and falling crop yields. There were also many who had moved, some multiple times.Map of Kampheko 2 in MalawiChibonda moved to Kampheko 2 in 2021 to access land, as his home village had matrilineal inheritance. Granted 0.6 hectares (1.5 acres) by local chiefs who split Kampheko in two in 1982, he was attracted by the fertile soil and villagers growing rice, an especially thirsty crop.Chibonda relied on a borehole but the irrigated radius around it started shrinking even in the three years he lived there. Then, the borehole was destroyed by vandals in 2024. Yellowed grass now pokes out the broken concrete.On the other side of the village, at the bottom of a wide, dusty depression, 49-year-old Patricia Ngola scooped out dirty water from a hole populated by frogs and flies. Before 2020, the water hole could irrigate nearby fields, said the chief, John Sasamola.Many Malawians struggle to access water for household needs, let alone agriculture. In rural areas 37% of people walk more than 30 minutes to get water, compared with 13% in towns and cities, according to Unicef.In 2019, Unicef estimated $97m a yearwas needed to provide all Malawians with waterwithin a half-hour walk by 2030 – the UN sustainable development goal (SDG) target year – with another $259m required annually for clean water in people’s homes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2023, Unicef estimated spending had to quadruple to reach the SDG target. But, with recent US and other aid cuts, it could now be only one-sixth of the need, Phiri said.Next to Kampheko 2’s dusty water hole, Steria Fakson harvested sweet potatoes by hand. The 0.4-hectare plot would yield just three bags, the 23-year-old said. Before she was born, it could produce enough to fill an oxcart, her step-grandmother Ngola told her. Fakson said she had not thought about moving, though: “I think I’ll wait for water.”Not the entrepreneurial Chibonda. In June 2024, he trekked 15 miles to Chiganji. He had heard about available land near a borehole installed by Water Aid for a school, but now used by the whole village. A month later he brought his wife and four children, whose ages now range from two to seven, to the new site (Chibonda also had eight children with his late first wife).However, villagers only allowed him to irrigate at night. That, and the meagre rainwater, still was not enough to fulfil Chibonda’s ambitions, which included creating fishponds.“I look at water as capital for business … But as I started seeing that the water supply there was no longer going to support my dreams, I decided to move,” he said.In January, Chibonda and his family migrated again. This time they moved 120 miles north-east to a 9 hectare (22 acre) plot, where water can be pumped from Lake Malawi about a mile away. Chibonda has planted sugarcane, bananas and cabbages and is targeting an orchard of 1,000 mango, orange and guava trees, as well as his much hankered-after fishponds.“For me, it’s the rain patterns,” he said, reflecting on the impact of the climate crisis. “That is why my vision has always been to find a water source that doesn’t rely on rain … In recent years, at the time when we all need rain, the rain does not come.”View image in fullscreenGladys Khumbidzi pictured outside her home in Chiganji, Malawi. She has moved twice to try to find better water sources, but now says she is too old to move again.Photograph: Rachel Savage/The GuardianGladys Khumbidzi first moved 22 years ago, because of repeated floods. Then, in her new home, the water supply got progressively worse. The shallow boreholes were drying up at the end of the November to April rainy season, sometimes as early as February. So, seven years ago, she moved again, to Chiganji.But, recently, Khumbidzi has struggled to grow enough to feed herself and her three grandchildren, their home being a 25-minute walk from the water pump.“In the first years, I could plant the vegetable gardens. But now … one year it will work, another year it will not work,” she said, recalling a year where the rain had not stopped – destroying her crops, and then last year, when the drought killed everything.Khumbidzi, who is in her mid-60s , said she was too old to move again: “As the elders say, a rolling stone gathers no moss. I feel that I have rolled enough in my life. If I die, I will die right here.”Explore more on these topicsMalawiUnited NationsFood povertyClimate crisisDroughtFloodingAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

On the main stage of the world’s biggest tourism fair, Stefan Gössling, a leading researcher in sustainable transport, had just calmly announced the looming death of the holiday industry.“We have already entered the beginning of the age of non-tourism,” said Gössling, to an uneasy audience of travel agencies, car rental companies, cruise operators and hoteliers.That prophecy may sound fanciful to holidaymakers in Europe and North America who have been jetting off this summer – as well as to industry executives delighted to see international tourism return to pre-pandemic highs last year – but Gössling argues that as carbon pollution stokes heatwaves, fuels wildfires and ruins harvests, the cost of foreign travel will soar, and fewer people will be able to afford it.“Eighty years ago, mass tourism started in Europe,” said Gössling, a professor at the business and economics school at Linnaeus University in Sweden, who has consulted for the UN and the World Bank. “Eighty years from now, I’m doubtful there will be much tourism left in the world.”Gössling is not short of examples of destinations already feeling the squeeze. Warm weather is melting snow that keeps Alpine ski resorts alive. Coastal erosion is stripping sand from southern European beaches. Droughts are forcing Spanish hotels to ship in fresh water as swimming pools lie empty, while wildfires are setting scenic Greek islands ablaze.ChartThe South Aegean islands in Greece, which include the tourist favourites Kos, Rhodes and Mykonos, are the “single most critical” hotspot on the continent, according to astudyGössling co-authored last month combining exposure to climate hazards with dependence on tourism. Next are the Ionian islands, which include Corfu.The financial strain caused by these issues, which travel companies will probably pass on to customers, will be compounded by the rising cost of food – from coffee to chocolate to olive oil – and the increasing need for insurance against extreme weather.“At the moment, it’s locally concentrated,” said Gössling, speaking to the Guardian earlier this year at the ITB Berlin, the world’s largest gathering of tourism companies. “But in the future, it will become more frequent, cover more places, and turn into something disruptive.”View image in fullscreenTourists shelter in the shade at the Parthenon, Athens, during a heatwave in June.Photograph: Stelios Misinas/ReutersWhether this rise in costs could outpace expected growth in global incomes is up for debate – some damages can be avoided through adaptation, though this, too, comes at a price – but tourists may feel the pinch even in scenarios that keep volatile weather under control. If carbon pollution does fall sharply – necessary to stop global heating – it will cost the most in sectors such as aviation, which is limited by physical constraints.Some governments hope to slap carbon taxes on flights to help finance the energy transition and compensate poor countries for damage caused by fossil fuels, and green groups are pushing for a frequent flier levy, which would increase duties for each extra flight in a year.Despite Gössling’s blunt assessment of the tourism industry’s efforts to decarbonise – “what the whole sector is doing is greenwashing” – he is seen as a crucial voice in the industry, with the conference billing his speech a “must-hear session for anyone who cares about the future of travel and our planet”.Some things are moving in the right direction, he added, such as hotels putting solar panels on their roofs and people beginning to acknowledge the problem.“We have a huge difficulty making the step from there to action,” said Gössling. “But people have realised they are running into risks, and want to understand business risks. The message is not welcome, but it certainly makes people think.”ChartIn academic circles, Gössling is best-known for studies that put numbers on thegrowing carbon footprint of tourism(8.8% of planet-heating pollution) and theinequality in aviation emissions(only 2-4% of people fly abroad in a given year). His finding that 1% of the world population are responsible for half the emissions from air transport has underlined activists’ calls for governments to make premium and business travel a priority.“If that group travelled half as much – which still is a lot, it probably would still be sufficient even for business travellers – we could cut [aviation] emissions by 25%,” he said. “Just by making a very tiny group travel a little less.”But he is also quick to counter arguments that ordinary people in rich countries can keep flying to far-flung places and justify it by pointing to even more polluting demographics. “Our headache is long-haul travel,” he said, mentioning gap years and Gen Z influencers who sell travel as an aspirational lifestyle.“Everyone sees tourism as a system, where governments and companies are responsible,” said Gössling. “But we are the system. It’s our individual actions that accumulate to global problems.”Explore more on these topicsTravel & leisureClimate crisisAir transportWildfiresExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

The pollution stems from a type of Pfas-laden firefighting foam the military has used across the nation, and the types of compounds found at high levels in participants’ blood were also commonly used in foam.“The results put heartbreak into hard facts,” said James Kenney, theNew Mexicoenvironment department secretary. “This evidence of the harm the US air force has done to its neighbors is a call to action to immediately address its longstanding, neglected, toxic Pfas plume that continues to expose the families of Curry county.”Pfas are a class of about 15,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. The chemicals have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment.Pfas are a common ingredient in firefighting foam, and the military is in the process of phasing it out because the highly toxic substance has widely contaminated water and the environment aroundmore than 700 bases nationwide. However, blood levels of nearby residents are not regularly monitored.The state of New Mexico is suing the air force to compel it to more quickly and thoroughly address its pollution in the region. It has poisoned at least 100 private wells, and a public well for Clovis, a nearby city of nearly 40,000 people.Levels found in surface water were about 27,000 times higher than US Environmental Protection Agency’s drinking water limits, and polluted water is used on cropland, raising questions about the safety of those products. Local dairy farmers in 2018 were forced to euthanize about 3,500 cows that had contaminated milk.“What happened here in Curry county, New Mexico, can happen in any town in USA, so we should all pay attention because it’s your water and your family next,” Kenney said.About 99% of 628 blood samples tested had Pfas, but the four compounds most frequently detected were those commonly used in firefighting foam.Though the US government estimates about 99% of people have Pfas in their blood, those living and working in the plume area showed much higher levels in general. About 26% were in the highest tier for Pfas blood levels nationally.People who lived or worked in the plume area showed levels of PFHxS, a common Pfas compound used in foam, at levels more than three times the estimated US average.The air force said it has not reviewed the data, but stressed that it is taking multiple steps to address the pollution, including installing a water treatment system.The levels in blood are similar to several other areas contaminated by firefighting foam, said David Andrews, chief science officer with the Environmental Working Group non-profit, which tracks foam and military pollution. The levels in blood are cause for concern, he added.“Definitely with higher concentrations there’s higher concern for the health impacts,” Andrews said. Those with higher levels should talk with their doctor and consult the US National Academies guidance on health risks for elevated Pfas blood levels, Andrews added.Explore more on these topicsNew MexicoPfasHealthUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

They were all treated at the scene for burns and smoke inhalation before being taken to hospital.A London fire brigade spokesperson said: “The brigade’s control officers received seven calls about the fire and mobilised crews from Ilford, Hainault, Leytonstone and Woodford fire stations to the scene. The fire was extinguished by 10.32pm.“The cause of the fire is being investigated by the brigade and the Metropolitan police service.” No arrests have been made.Alocal resident, Edward Thawe, 43, stepped outside his nearby home with his 12-year-old son to see whether he could help after hearing screaming on the road.The police and ambulance were already at the scene, which Thawe, a hospital porter, described as “horrible” and “more than scary” and something you did not “want to look at twice”.He said: “I heard screaming and people saying they had called the police. I came outside [the shop] and there was a man with his skin peeled off. His skin was burnt. I did not want to look at it.”DCI Mark Rogers, of the Met’s central specialist crime north unit, said: “We understand this incident will cause concern within the community. My team of specialist detectives are working at speed to piece the incident together.“Locals can expect to see a large police presence in the area. If you have any concerns, please speak to those officers on the ground.”Uniformed officers guarded the police cordon in place on Saturday as forensic officers in protective clothing examined the scene.A trail of what appeared to be bloody footprints along the pavement were found by a forensic officer.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, MP for Ilford North, posted on X: “Huge thanks to @metpoliceuk @LondonFire @Ldn_Ambulance for their response to a serious incident on Gants Hill/Woodford Avenue this evening.“Please avoid the area for now. Further updates will follow from @RedbridgeLive and emergency services.”Anyone with information is urged to contact the Met via 101, quoting 7559/22AUG.

But Fussey said: “The claims the Met are making about the absence of bias from the NPL report are not substantiated by the facts in that report.”For LFR to work, the sensitivity of the system can be varied. The more sensitive it is the more people it will detect, but the higher its potential bias will be on racial, gender and age grounds. Zero is its most sensitive setting and one the least sensitive.The NPL report found there was bias at a setting of 0.56. At a setting of 0.6 it found seven cases where people in its test were wrongly flagged as wanted – a false positive. All were from ethnic minorities.The study results were gained after 178,000 images were entered into the system. Four hundred volunteers walked past cameras approximately 10 times each, providing 4,000 chances for the system to correctly recognise them. They were contained in what the study estimated were crowds of more than 130,000 people at four sites inLondonand one in Cardiff. Testing took place in sunny conditions and totalled 34.5 hours, which Fussey said is shorter than in some other countries assessing LFR.From this sample, the report concluded there was no statistically significant bias at a setting of 0.6 or higher, a claim the Met has repeated to defend the use and expansion of LFR.Fussey said this was far too small a sample to support the Met’s claims. “The MPS [MetropolitanPoliceService] consistently claim their system has been independently tested for bias. Examining this research reveals the data is insufficient to support the claims being made .“The decisive conclusions the Met are stating publicly are based on analysis of just seven false matches. This is from a system that has analysed millions of Londoners’ faces. It is a weak statistical basis to make universal claims from such a small sample of false matches.”The Met now uses LFR at a sensitivity setting of 0.64, which the NPL study said produced no false matches.Fussey said: “According to their own research, false matches were not actually assessed at the settings they claim is free of bias, which is 0.64 or above.“Few, if any, in the scientific community would say the evidence is sufficient to support these claims extrapolated from such a small sample.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The Met police’s commentary is based on what the independent report found,” she said.“When we use LFR at the setting of 0.64 – which is what we now use – there is no statistically significant bias.“We commissioned the study to understand where potential bias might lie in the algorithm and used the findings to mitigate that risk.“Its findings show us what level to use the algorithm at to avoid bias and we always operate above that level and in a fair way.”At Notting Hill this weekend warning signs will tell people LFR is in use, next to the vans containing the cameras which are linked to a database of wanted suspects.Police believe its use at two sites on the approaches to the carnival will act as a deterrent. At the carnival itself, police are preparing to use retrospective facial recognition to capture suspects for violence and assaults.Fussey said: “Few would doubt the right of police to use technology to keep the public safe, but this needs to be done with proper accountability measures and in accordance with human rights standards.”The Met claims that since 2024, LFR’s false positive rate has been one in every 33,000 cases. It declined to say how many faces had been scanned but it is understood to be in the hundreds of thousands.In 2024 there were 26 false matches, with eight so far in 2025. The Met says none of these people were detained, as once the computer system flags a match, the decision on whether to arrest is made by a police officer.Before the carnival, the Met had arrested 100 people, with 21 recalled to prison and 266 being banned from attending. The force also said it had seized 11 firearms and more than 40 knives.Explore more on these topicsFacial recognitionMetropolitan policePoliceNotting Hill carnivalLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

He began working as a miner at the age of 16, at Sharlston colliery, near Wakefield, before moving to Selby coalfield, and later, Kellingley.He said many of the museum’s staff, particularly those who have gone on strike, are former miners.“I’d say 99% of us, I suppose you could call us veterans of the ‘84-’85 [strike],” he said. “I’m one of the youngest, believe it or not, up at the Mining Museum.”View image in fullscreenAbout 40 members of Unison are in dispute with the museum’s management over pay.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIn the 1980s, Kear was living at home with his parents – his mother did not do paid work, and he walked out of the pits alongside his father, Fred, a fellow miner.“It was horrible,” he said. “The Tory government managed to get some laws in very quickly that stopped my mum claiming any benefits, so there wasn’t a penny coming into our house.The confrontation at Orgreave: a visual timelineRead more“But everybody got together, the community got together. Soup kitchens were opened up, we could get one meal a day. Up at the miners’ welfare club, we could go up once a week and you got a carrier bag full of shopping.“It really was horrible,” he added. “It really brought the community together, people helped each other out, but when they started shutting the mines, that destroyed communities.“You’d have thought that was a strike to end all strikes, wouldn’t you?” he said. “Like the big war should have been the war to end all wars. But it hasn’t worked out that way.”This strike is very different. “The last time, you’re up against the government that had big, deep pockets, and no matter what happened, you weren’t going to win,” he said.This time, he hoped, the industrial action may be successful. “When we do want to retire, if [the job] isn’t a decent income, how’re they going to attract somebody else to do what we’re doing?” he asked.About 40 members of the Unison union are in dispute with the museum’s management over pay. They say the existing offer – of a rise of 5% or 80p an hour, whichever is greater, for all workers – is less than the previous deal proposed by the union and which they believed would be accepted by management. But the museum said it was an “increased offer” on previous pay proposals and “equates to a 6% pay rise for many”.The strike, which is due to last until 14 September, with further action planned if an agreement is not reached, has caused underground tours to be suspended, but the rest of the museum remains open.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t want to be doing this.“This is a place where I really do like to go and share my heritage and my history, and I just don’t want to be doing it [striking].”A spokesperson for the museum said the pay offer was higher than pay settlements in the public sector, including the police, schools and other museums.“This increased offer was rejected by Unison,” they said. “The union refused to share our revised offer with their members to see if they wished to accept it.“As a charitable organisation, the museum, which relies on external funding and donations, continues to face considerable financial pressures.”The spokesperson said they hoped “Unison will reconsider their position”, adding that they “remain committed to working closely with union representatives in the hope of a resolution”.Explore more on these topicsIndustrial actionWest YorkshireThe miners’ strike 1984-85MuseumsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It comes after a decade of what one chief fire officer said was in effect the service “being defunded”, with an estimated £1bn in government funding cut during this time.This week, fire chiefs said proposed funding changes were likely to leave the service more than £100m worse off over the next three years, equivalent to 1,500 full-time firefighters. They have been urging the government to protect services from the cuts to grants that were announced in June’s spending review.At Camels Head, the interior is arguably worse than the outside. Faux leather peels off the seats of the old, mismatched chairs in the break room, where a TV stand has been fabricated from the repurposed end of a snooker table.View image in fullscreenCapital funding for fire services to invest in buildings and equipment has plummeted by an estimated £1bn in the last decade.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianBrown watermarks stain each ceiling – the result of six decades of leaks – and in many areas it has fallen in entirely. Plaster crumbles off most of the walls, single-glazed windows fail to keep out the rain and cold and the 60-year-old heating system is often broken. “Finding the parts is a challenge,” Carey says.Office screens divide a large dormitory room into sections where each staff member can rest. There is hope that doors can be added, “because nobody wants to get changed in full view of people”, irrespective of gender.View image in fullscreenThe station’s dormitory room is divided by office screens that section off parts of the room for staff to get some rest.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianA rat box hides discreetly near a doorway in the station’s kitchen. Doors are generally kept shut – less than ideal in a building where people need to move quickly from one room to another – in an effort to prevent mice from having free rein on a site built on marshland.View image in fullscreenA rat box near the kitchen.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian“It is in dire need, I can’t sugarcoat it,” Carey says. “I want to be able to give [the firefighters] something better.”The station resembles a time capsule, with Hi-de-Hi!-style 1960s loudspeakers, old wooden lockers and door signs written in midcentury typography. Carey jokes they would sell for a bit of money to hipsters.View image in fullscreen‘It is in dire need’: Carey says he wants the firefighters to have something better than the run-down station they work in.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianFirefighters have done their best with the space, planting a wildflower meadow outside and hanging artwork and fairy lights inside.They also maintain a good sense of humour about their surroundings. In one room, a large mirror had clearly long-since been removed from the wall and later replaced with a compact mirror from a makeup set. Someone has drawn an arrow to it and scribbled “Station 48 refurbishment complete”.View image in fullscreenThe firefighters try to maintain a good sense of humour about their surroundings, but the level of disrepair does affect the team.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianCarey admits the level of disrepair has a substantial effect on the team. “I’m a morale officer sometimes,” he says.Yet the pride felt by the staff is displayed on the walls, with pictures showing crews that have come and gone at Camels Head through the decades, some showing them lined up side-by-side in uniform while others capture them in action, tackling terrifying-looking blazes. Framed cuttings from the local press show occasions when the community has been grateful for the work of the men and women based there.“It’s a really loved station,” says Carey.View image in fullscreenPictures of crews over the decades at Camels Head adorn the walls.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianThe issues here are not just aesthetic. There are serious health concerns about the lack of adequate decontamination zones, as more is learned about firefighters’ increased risk of cancer brought about by their contact with toxic contaminants.With some irony, the station was recently assessed as not meeting fire regulations. Work is being carried out urgently to rectify that.Camels Head falling into such disrepair is not an oversight but an economic inevitability, driven by the fact fire services nationally are being “essentially defunded”, says the Devon and Somerset fire chief, Gavin Ellis.Capital funding for fire services to invest in buildings and equipment has plummeted by an estimated £1bn in the last decade, after the government cancelled key grants in 2014-15. The National Fire Chiefs Council said that as a result services have not been able to maintain or modernise ageing infrastructure for a decade.View image in fullscreenCarey holds up broken blinds to reveal a plan for the station’s ‘2027 refurbishment’.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianCallouts have increased by a fifth over this time as fire services respond to the rise in the impacts of the climate crisis, such as wildfires and flooding.This month,major incidents were declared by two English fire services, North Yorkshire and Dorset and Wiltshire, after large wildfires broke out. This came days aftermore than 100 firefighters responded to a huge blaze at Arthur’s Seatin Edinburgh.The fire chiefs’ council warned last week that 2025 wason track to beat the national record for wildfiresand that firefighters were “pushed to their limits”.This is partly as a result of swingeing personnel cuts. Firefighter numbers inEnglandhave dropped by a quarter in seven years, the equivalent of 11,000 full-time staff, according to the government’s workforce statistics.View image in fullscreenIn Devon and Somerset, 85% of the service’s budget is spent on people, which leaves little allocated to buildings and equipment.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianCamels Head has been reduced from 16 people per watch to just eight, and from seven full-time pumps to four.In Devon and Somerset, 85% of the service’s budget is spent on people, which leaves little allocated to buildings and equipment.At Camels Head, the fire engine is new and Carey says personal protective equipment is a priority, but that is not the case for other parts of the country and a“postcode lottery” determines the quality of equipment, including valuable life-saving apparatus.The Fire Brigades Union general secretary, Steve Wright, says there are “extreme examples where firefighters are having to go without facilities like showers”, that there are 18 fire stations in Scotland without running water and “there are horror stories of firefighters being handed wet wipes to try to decontaminate with”.“Fire stations are crumbling, basic things like PPE aren’t up to scratch across the board. The service is in a state of chaos across the UK, and the only way to rebuild it is with sustained funding from the government,” he adds.”There simply aren’t enough firefighters to keep the public and fire crews safe. Working to save lives without enough resources, in smaller crews, is simply exhausting and, at worst, dangerous.”Firefighters, he says, deserve better.View image in fullscreenSteve Wright, the FBU general secretary, said the fire service was in a ‘state of chaos’. In areas of the Camels Head station, parts of the ceiling have fallen in.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianEllis agrees that Camels Head is not an unusual case. He mentions another station where ivy is growing on the inside of the building, and even some that are so old that women cannot work there due to a lack of facilities.He says it is important that staff know “we’re making really difficult, tough decisions to protect them” and that fire chiefs are constantly writing to MPs, the Treasury and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government to “highlight the challenges that we’ve got around our finances”.A spokesperson for the ministry said standalone fire and rescue authorities would get an increase in core spending power of up to £69.1m in 2025-26, a 3.6% rise on the previous year.Ellis says: “If we don’t do something to shock the system now or put a stop, then what we’re going to see is a continuation of the fire service being defunded essentially, and that really concerns me from a perspective around national resilience.“I feel we’re at a point that if we don’t do something soon, the role of the firefighter will change, the impact it will have on the community will change, and once it’s gone, it will be very, very difficult to get it back.”Explore more on these topicsFirefightersEmergency servicesEnglandDevonPlymouthSpending review 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

Brønlund, 18, says she has since only seen her daughter once, for an hour, when she was not allowed to comfort the baby or change her nappy.The “parenting competence” tests, known as FKU (forældrekompetenceundersøgelse), werebanned on people with Greenlandic backgroundsearlier this year after years of criticism by campaigners and human rights bodies, who argued successfully that the tests were racist because they were culturally unsuitable for people from Inuit backgrounds. As the law came into force in May, campaigners are asking why Brønlund was still subjected to a test.The Danish social affairs minister, Sophie Hæstorp Andersen, has said she was concerned by the reports and had requested the municipality behind the decision, Høje-Taastrup, to explain its handling of the case. “Standardised tests should not be used in placement cases involving families with a Greenlandic background. The law is clear,” she said.Brønlund’s case has prompted protests in Greenland, with further protests planned in Nuuk, Copenhagen, Reykjavík and Belfast.View image in fullscreenIvana Nikoline Brønlund gave birth to her daughter, Aviaja-Luuna, on 11 August.Photograph: Ivana Nikoline BrønlundBrønlund was told that her baby was removed because of the trauma she had suffered at the hands of her adoptive father, who is in prison for sexually abusing her. The municipality told her she was “not Greenlandic enough” for the new law banning the tests to apply, despite her being born in Greenland of Greenlandic parents.Local authorities started the testing on her in April – after an announcement in January that the ban was coming in. They completed the tests in June, at which point the law was in force. Brønlund was told three weeks before giving birth that her child would be taken away.The municipality declined to comment, saying it was bound by confidentiality. But it has admitted to faults in its processes and said it was seeking to ensure the family’s legal requirements were met and “the best possible solution” for the family.Brønlund told the Guardian: “I didn’t want to go into labour because I knew what would happen afterwards. I would keep my baby nearby me when she was in my stomach, that was the closest I would be with her. It was a very rough and horrible time.”She said her first meeting with her daughter, earlier this week, was cut short early because the baby was believed to be overtired and overstimulated.“My heart broke when she [the supervisor] stopped the time. I was so sad, I cried out to the car and in the car. It was so fast that we had to leave,” she said, through tears. “My heart is so broken, I don’t know what to do without her.”Brønlund is allowed to see her baby, under supervision, only once a fortnight for two hours at a time. Her appeal will be heard on 16 September.Brønlund’s adoptive mother, Gitte, who is half-Greenlandic and lived there until she was 37, said: “It feels like you are not allowed to have a trauma if you are going to be a mum.”Campaigners have called on the Danish government to take urgent action to help Brønlund. Dida Pipaluk Jensen, who is co-organising a demonstration in the Icelandic capital outside the Danish embassy on 18 September, said the way the tests were being used on Greenlandic people was “horrifying”.Campaigners have also held a protest in support of another Greenlandic mother,Keira Alexandra Kronvold, whose case prompted a global outcry after Danish authorities forcibly removed her daughter Zammi two hours after her birth. They are still separated.Of Brønlund’s case, Pipaluk Jensen said: “One of the reasons the municipality stated for the removal of her daughter was because of previous trauma in Ivana’s life. This feels so wrong to punish Ivana for something she is not responsible for.”Laila Bertelsen, the founder of Foreningen MAPI, an association that helps Inuit parents inDenmark, has written to the minister urging her to intervene. She wrote: “Here we are faced with a failure of both child and mother, which requires immediate political action.”Hæstorp Andersen, who is due to visit Greenland in September, said any municipality considering placing a child with a Greenlandic background in care, or considering using FKU tests on Greenlandic families, “must instead use a special unit known as VISO”.Anya Krogh Manghezi, the director of children and youth at Høje-Taastrup municipality, said: “Based on the case and the criticism raised, we have taken a closer look at our case processing. We assessed that we showed due diligence by contacting VISO already in January, but we must acknowledge that we should have repeated the contact, as the legal basis finally fell into place three months after April 29, 2025.“We are therefore now in close dialogue with VISO on how we can get advice on an updated basis as soon as possible. We are only interested in ensuring that the family’s legal requirements are met and that the best possible solution is found for the family.”Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkIndigenous peoplesWomenFosteringnewsShareReuse this content"

How sweet.’ It’s like, excuse my language: ‘Fuck off.’ There’s something very condescending about some people’s attitudes and I think they think they are being kind and generous. But they’re not. They’re being insulting.”She recalled the words of her mother, who told her never to be afraid of getting older, and said there were great things about ageing: You “lose certain stuff but you gain other stuff”.“The tech bros think their billions are somehow going to hold back time,” she said. “They haven’t learnt my mum’s lesson. It’s a natural wave of life that has been going on for billions of years and it’s beautiful to be part of that wave.“It’s what humanity is all about in the end. So it’s important not to wimp out. You’re not going to be 30 when you’re 50. You’re just not.”Mirren has been reminded of mortality throughout her life by the deaths of loved ones. Her younger brother, Peter, died of skin cancer at 54 in 2002, and her stepson Rio Hackford died at 51 of cancer in 2022.“As you travel through life you realise death is absolutely part of life. And it’s always tragic and it can happen when you’re young,” she said.In The Thursday Murder Club, Mirren playing the former spy Elizabeth, who runs a murder investigation group alongside fellow residents of a retirement community.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The state of British TV documentary film-making is a little depressing at the moment. Open up the documentaries tab on iPlayer, Now, ITVX or Channel 4, and you’ll be assaulted by a rush of true crime docs, each with their own macabre/salacious title – Satan’s Au Pair, Catching the Frying Pan Killer, that sort of thing – and a little rectangular title card with said killer looking evil, preferably in a grainy black and white picture with a bloody thumbprint overlaid.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.And it if isn’t true crime you’re greeted with, it will be one of the other broadcaster-permitted forms of documentary these days: celebrity travelogues; largely unenlightening pop science docs about just how bad a certain type of food is for you; shameless corporate tie-ins where someone walks round a Haribo factory and gawps in wonder; tightly controlled famous-people profiles, where anything vaguely controversial or interesting has been sliced out of the final, interviewee-approved cut; or series about air fryers (Channel 5, we salute yourunwavering commitment to this sub-genre).OK I’m being a bit harsh here. There are still plenty ofgreat,agenda-settingTV documentaries being made. But it does feel like an extremely hard time to be one of those TV documentary-makers, who have to work within the strictures of streaming, where series need to slot neatly into algorithmically selected genre verticals. You’d imagine many of those doc-makers must have read tributes and obituaries to Alan Yentob, when he passed away back in May, and felt a pang of jealousy over thefreedom of his Arena heyday, where there was the potential to go and make documentaries on the Ford Cortina, the Chelsea Hotel or anything else, big or small, that fascinated you.View image in fullscreenFilm-maker Molly Dineen discussing her film The Lie of the Land at Hay Festival 2007.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianLately I’ve been swerving a lot of current docs to instead watch older ones unaffected by algorithms andtaste clusters. I’ve been really enjoying the films ofMolly Dineen(pictured above), who seems a little overlooked in 2025 but who in the late 80s and 90s was regarded as a bit of documentary wunderkind, delivering a series of humane, idiosyncratic films about British life. Her breakthrough was in 1987 with Home From the Hill, a portrait of an old Empire colonel returning to Britain and having to navigate a changed world (and, in one absurd scene, a tin of ravioli). Resembling a real-life Rowley Birkin QC sketch from The Fast Show, but sadder and stranger, it was picked up by the BBC despite being made while Dineen was still in film school.From there she rattled through a run of fascinating films on London Zoo, Irish roadwork companies, The House of Lords, and an epic two-hour profile of Geri Halliwell as she went from Spice Girl to UN goodwill ambassador. You’ll have to stump up for these – they’re available torent on the BFI Player– though one of Dineen’s filmsisavailable on streaming, and it’s a corker.Heart of the Angel(1989), available on iPlayer, followed the “fluffers”, maintenance workers and ticket inspectors at a then-dilapidated Angel tube station as they mused on the existence of heaven and hell and argued over the cost of a single to Oval.And actually, when you dig past the true crime, the iPlayer is a pretty amazing archive for these sorts of freewheeling older docs: tucked away in its furthest corners you’ll, find for example,Signs of the Times, a collaboration between the Beeb and Martin Parr that looks at ideas of good and bad taste in the British home, from mouldering country piles to terrace houses, and is full of eccentric figures like the bloke who thought it looked more stylish to only fill in the stonework on half of the wall behind his mantelpiece. Or old episodes of the archaeology strand Chronicle, including aloopy instalmentwhere the show, with help from Olympic 800m runner Ann Packer, attempts to fact check the erroneous idea that Pliny claimed the Romans marched a load of geese from Northern Gaul to Rome. Or classic Arena instalments on the aforementioned Chelsea Hotel and pop artist Peter Blake’s fascination with Kendo Nagasaki. Or, of course, the hefty archive of films by Adam Curtis, from his early series like Pandora’s Box and the Living Dead, right up to the shorts he did forCharlie Brooker’s Screenwipe.View image in fullscreenNick Broomfield’s Biggie and Tupac.Photograph: Film Four/Lafayette/Kobal/ShutterstockChannel 4, too, is stuffed full of great vintage TV docs: Nick Broomfield films on the far-right south African politicianEugène Terre’Blanche,Biggie and Tupac, apost-premiership Margaret Thatcher, and the media circus around serial killerAileen ‘Monster’ Wuornos; orChasing Rainbows, one of the first proper TV surveys of British musical culture, from the music hall to Bhangra dance nights; or the three parter,White Tribe, where the great racial justice campaigner and broadcaster Darcus Howe digs into the meaning of white English culture, complete with an encounter with Bernard Manning. There are constant reminders of C4’s boundary-pushing, wildly experimental past in series likeThe Trip, an eight-parter that set early Nasa footage to Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada and Richie Hawtin, orThe Ghosts of Oxford Street, a completely crackers Malcolm McLaren docu-music film ode to London’s retail mecca that featured Tom Jones as the founder of Selfridges and the Happy Mondays as hanged highwaymen, and was somehow broadcast on Christmas Day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nicoresti pockets £10,000 in prize money and, on accepting the award, joked they had promised their partner the win a year ago to help pay for their upcoming wedding.At a ceremony hosted very amusingly bylast year’s winner Amy Gledhill, the best newcomer prize, worth £5,000, was won by Ayoade Bamgboye, forthe show Swings and Roundabouts. The Londoner, who was raised in Nigeria, was in tears on receiving the award, which has in the past launched the careers of acts including Sarah Millican, Harry Hill and The Mighty Boosh. The Victoria Wood award, presented to those who “embody the true spirit of the fringe”, went toComedy Club 4 Kids, which runs children’s standup shows and workshops, on its 20th anniversary.View image in fullscreenAyoade Bamgboye won best newcomer with the show Swings and Roundabouts.Photograph: Alan RennieThe director of the comedy awards, the West End theatre producer Nica Burns, said: “Our 2025 winners capture the spirit of comedy right now: bold, brilliant and deeply connected to audiences. In different ways, they’ve each created shows that feel utterly of this moment, sparking laughter while saying something lasting. Together, they remind us why the fringe matters, a place where the freshest voices can shine.”Traditionally rounding off the three-plus-week festival, the ceremony took place at noon on Saturday before an audience of comics and industry figures. Stepping into a lineage of irreverent co-hosts of the award, the former winners Adam Riches and John Kearns appeared in character ascrooners Ball and Boe, delivering edgy gags – as Gledhill did – about the fringe’s ambivalent relationship with Scottish comedy and the residents of Edinburgh.Give or take the leagues-ahead quality of the former best newcomerCat Cohen’s show Broad Strokes, mystifyingly not represented on the shortlist (and attended last night by Tina Fey), Nicoresti’s victory was well earned. Pivoting this year to high-joke-count standup after finding early success with more leftfield work (they are a prominent member of a comedy collective called Weirdos), their show addresses life as a trans woman in a spirit of joy, playfulness and self-irony that could clearly capture the hearts of mainstream audiences.I welcome their win – although I’d have been equally happy to see another star-in-the-makingJohn Tothillrewarded. After brushes with malaria and appendicitis in recent years (as recounted in this year’s show), Tothill must content himself with at least having completed his first fringe runnotto result in a near-death experience.A nomination for the queer Canadian performance art/comedy duo the Creepy Boys, with their show Slugs, ensured welcome representation at comedy’s top table for the fringiest of fringe work. Bamgboye’s win was incontrovertible: sharp, commanding and with star quality in spades, she’s going places. Hopefully one of those places will be next year’s fringe. The festival continues to be the most electrifying destination in live comedy.Figures to be released in the coming weeks will demonstrate how the event has fared commercially in tough times for the performing arts. But, as the comedy awards again proved, for new talent, wild creativity and big laughs – and for practitioners and audience both – the Edinburgh fringe remains the most thrilling place to be.Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)Awards and prizesFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

She says they are always about nations and leaders and never about the people directly affected.Fuselage shows that there is a good reason for this: human interest stories (of which there are a lot) tend to tell you only that people get sad when sad things happen. Just like this play.Imagine if there had been an episode of the TV seriesFamein which the writers had decided to get serious. As well as following a group of drama students in their quest for stardom, they would include a global terror incident. The downing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, for example.Faustus in Africa! review – William Kentridge’s devilishly clever twist on damnationRead moreThis is the setup for Fuselage. It is a routine story of student life – classes, crushes and clashes – brought to a halt by the bombing of the plane on 21 December 1988. Had Lareau been able to afford to change her ticket, she would have joined 35 classmates from Syracuse University on the fated flight.Where previous Lockerbie dramas, such as Des Dillon’sLockerbie 103and David Benson’sLockerbie: Unfinished Business, have found their anger in causes and cover-ups, this one talks nebulously of “terrorists” and presents the death of Lareau’s fellow students, including her best friend Theodora Cohen, not as a matter of wider public concern but as a personal outrage. It is astonishingly devoid of politics.Lareau suffered a devastating loss and the emotional toll must have been unbearable, but the play’s lack of context, barring some scene-setting clips, turns a globally significant attack into something small and private. Makaela Milburn’s production, also starring Peter Dylan O’Connor and Brenda Joyner, manipulates the audience into empathetic sobs and changes nothing.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalLockerbie plane bombingScotlandreviewsShareReuse this content"

Something of that remains in Go West, Old Maid, where we meet again the gen Z flatmates to whom Norris plays “cool governess”. But it’s worn more lightly here, put on for laughs to startle us, and slipped out of when – the thrust of the show, this – she wants to talk about her late dad, a plummy thespian dispensing useless advice to Katie across not so much a generation gap as a chasm.That gives Norris the only excuse she needs to open with a withering takedown of “old dads”, and an enjoyable fantasy of herself becoming a mum in her 80s. She has great fun with her predilection for man-crushing here, notably in a song, about being a godmother that imagines her exes turned into toads at the bottom of her garden. An even finer number conjures her father’s nostalgia for his theatrical golden age – and by that stage, the song is amusing and tender in equal measure, because we have heard he went to a brutal boarding school with Boris Johnson’s dad, and so he has our deepest sympathy.Kiell Smith-Bynoe and Friends: Kool Story Bro review – eccentric improv anticsRead moreIn between, some asides about Norris’s secretive mum (raising so many questions as to almost knock the dead-dad show off its axis), a routine about her personal trainer, and a show-and-tell about her new taxidermy habit. Cumulatively, Go West, Old Maid doesn’t make quite the impact of Farm Fatale: there’s something anticlimactic about its dramatic shape, and the act-out of her father’s supposed play script feels like a generic nugget of audience participation.But at her best, for most of this show, Norris isn’t generic in the slightest. She has developed such a distinctive and diverting persona: threatening (but just for fun), eccentric and proud of it in her “Victorian bellboy” outfit, apt at any moment to drop an unhinged aside or out-of-the-blue song – like the cracker here celebrating the missionary position. “Old soul”, she may be, but Norris’s act is in glorious full bloom.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

And it isn’t exactly flattering to the likes of Boy George, Vanilla Ice and TLCRhik SamadderSat 23 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTShareIwould like to understand K-pop better, as I believe it is very popular with the kids. That sentence is a hard-working one: it introduces the information that I have spent this week watching the new Apple TV+ show KPopped (from Friday 29 August), while suggesting I am too old to have any hope of success. But it’s nowhere near as hard-working as a Korean pop star.This battle of the bands-style show aims to raise awareness of K-pop in the west like it’s lymphatic filariasis or something. The format reminds me of PE lessons. You know how gym teachers split groups of friends up, so they concentrate? Here, Korean boy and girl groups such as JO1 and Blackswan are split in half. Each half works with a famous western pop artist, re-tooling their best-known song in K-pop mode. The resulting performances are voted for by the studio audience, and the winner gets – well, nothing. An injection of relevance.The show is produced and hosted by rapperMegan Thee Stallion– with Gangnam Style’sPsyas co-host. I have spent five years trying to understand why Megan Thee Stallion is called that. Whenever I ask the internet, it assumes I’m questioning the horse bit. (She is statuesque, like a stallion, which seems self-explanatory.) It’s actually the Elizabethan English in the middle I’m intrigued by. Thee? An archaic form of address used in place of “you”? I guess no one wants to get pronouns wrong, so they leave it alone.The format is confusing, too. Each episode has two famous western artists competing against each other, supported by one mega-famous K-pop band, who are battling themselves. So, Megan Thee Stallion v R&B veteran Patti LaBelle, each with half of Billie. Or 80s stars Taylor Dayne v Vanilla Ice, each teamed with half of girl group Kep1er. But when I jump straight to the Spice Girls ep, it turns out to just be Mel B and Emma Bunton. Rather than splitting up – too triggering? – Scary and Baby both perform with both groups, working against the show’s competitive logic. Also, watching a studio vote after the fact just isn’t that exciting.View image in fullscreenNew attitude … Patti LaBelle in KPopped.Photograph: Courtesy of AppleWhat I am gripped by is the balance of power in the rehearsal rooms. The globally popular K-poppers have the grace and uncanny communication of synchronised swimmers. Perfect features, skin like peach blossom. Drilled within a hyper-exacting star system, they dance like a murmuration of swallows, or a handful of diamonds thrown in the air. The westerners, by comparison, look like dead weight. They dance like Rocky Balboa. They move less often than a 90-year-old in rent-controlled property. You can see their aura draining.“Finally, we’re having a laugh!” Mel B exclaims, pulling out an intentionally hapless cartwheel in rehearsals, to polite titters. Some of this is to do with age, but not all of it. I love Emma Bunton, but can’t see her popping or locking. Even Thee Stallion, no slouch, looks almost static. I’ve never seen anyone look less impressed than Colombian singerJ Balvinbeing shown around a South Korean market. He’s worried, is the thing. He looks even more dejected once he gets into rehearsals with boybandAteez. “Shall we show him an easy one?” one of them says, in Korean.The problem is that our pop stars are, above all, salespeople of their own charisma, which they cannot subsume. It’s an existential nightmare for them to share the stage. Korea, like most Asian countries, values group harmony, cooperation, respect for elders and social hierarchy. You’ve never seen such polite celebs. “I think we will win” is the sassiest they get. Our performers are like badly behaved schoolkids, acting out because they’re falling behind in history.I understand K-pop now. Impeccable choreography, maximalist production and millions of ideas. But it’s still our guys I’m tuning in for, to see who handles the pressure least well. Will Boy George say something cutting? Will TLC cause an international incident? Will Vanilla Ice get detention for smoking? Who will these legends prove themselves to be, when they’re not the most popular person in the room? KPopped isn’t thee best talent show ever created, but it may be thee most revealing.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ah!Tim DowlingSat 23 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 23 Aug 2025 13.44 EDTShareSummer seems to end earlier every year – the weather turns, the football starts, and you realise you’re going to spend the remainder of August trying to reconnect with your lost luggage. This year the traditional demarcation between the seasons – when we arrive home from holiday to find everything in our house in dire need of immediate repair – has come so early that we haven’t even been away yet. The light switch in the downstairs loo is stuck in the on position. The back door will not shut. The garden hose has exploded.“Nothing in this house works,” my wife says, trying to flick the jammed light switch.“Better always on than always off,” I say, trying to be positive. A stuck light switch is no reason to cancel your holiday, after all.It has been a bright, warm summer morning, but now the sky suddenly darkens. A steady rain starts to fall. I begin the long process of trying to close the garden door: yanking it shut while lifting the handle – repeatedly – until it finally catches. After a few moments the rain turns heavy, battering the skylight above.“I was gonna buy a new hose today,” I say. “I guess there’s no hurry.”“We needed the rain, I suppose,” my wife says, staring out the window as the back garden blurs.“That’s the spirit,” I say. The oldest one appears, down from the attic bedroom where he now lives and works.“The roof is leaking,” he says. “I need something to catch the water.”“Take a bowl,” my wife says.“I put a bowl there already,” he says. “But the bowl is full. I need a bucket.”I was struck by the speed at which the water cascaded from the crack. It wasn’t like a leaking roof. It was like not having a roof at allWe find a bucket and follow him upstairs. A crack has appeared in the bedroom ceiling – several cracks, in fact, forming a jagged asterisk with water pouring steadily from its centre.“That’s new,” I say. In the distance I hear the ominous roll of thunder. I think: this actually is the kind of thing people cancel holidays for.By the time the bucket is full the rain has stopped and the sun is out. Normally I would take this opportunity to put the problem out of my mind, but I was struck by the speed at which the water cascaded from the crack. It wasn’t like a leaking roof. It was like not having a roof at all.Later, on my way to bed, I find a wet spot on the lower bannister, which I trace to a second leak – water raining down two floors from the very top of the staircase. I decide not to tell anyone about this.“Did you call Mark?” I ask my wife the next day. I am referring to Mark the builder, who my wife sometimes calls “Mark No Problem” in order to contrast his approach to life and work with mine.“Yes,” she says. “I told him it was fairly urgent.”“Did he say ‘no problem’?”“He didn’t, actually,” she says. “He said the roofer he usually recommends has just retired.”“Oh,” I say.“But he’s going to try to find someone else,” she says.The next day my wife texts me a phone number to call. It’s from Mark, but it’s a recommendation once removed: he’s heard good things.The man at the other end of the phone seems mildly suspicious of me, an unrecommended customer. But he says he will try to stop by and look at my leak before Thursday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

That’s why there’s always a glut of fresh produce in the kitchen, both hers and mine – like mother, like daughter. At this time of year, that means courgettes, and the usual way I dispatch them is in ashaak(dry curry) or a pilau. Today’s dish is a combination of the two: spiced fried courgettes, just shy of melted, tossed through rice with fresh herbs and served with a fancy salted pistachio yoghurt masquerading as a raita.Courgette and mint pilau with salted pistachio yoghurtPrep15 minCook55 minServes4For the rice300g basmati riceOlive oil2 red onions, peeled and sliced into very thin half-moonsFine sea salt750g courgettes, cut into thin half-moons4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced1 tsp ground coriander1 tsp ground cumin450ml vegetable stock20g fresh mint, leaves pickedFor the yoghurt40g shelled pistachios, very finely chopped30g fresh coriander, very finely chopped2green fingerchillies, stalks discarded, the rest very finely chopped½ tsp agave syrup½ tsp fine sea salt2 tbsp lemon juice200ggreek yoghurtPut the rice in a bowl, cover with cold water, then squish with your hands to wash the rice until the water goes cloudy. Drain the rice and repeat three to five times, until the water runs clear, then cover with fresh cold water and put to one side.To cook the onions, heat four tablespoons of oil in a wide saute pan. When it’s hot, add the sliced onions and a teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, for eight to 10 minutes, until soft and browning. Add the courgettes and cook, stirring every now and then, for 15 minutes. Stir in the garlic, coriander and cumin, cook for a couple of minutes, until the raw garlic smell has gone, then take off the heat and leave to cool.Drain the rice, put it in a medium saucepan for which you have a tight-fitting lid, then pour over the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Once it’s boiling, turn down the heat to a whisper, cover and leave to cook for 10 minutes. Take off the heat and set aside, lid still on, for another 10 minutes.To make the pistachio yoghurt, in a small bowl mix the pistachios, coriander, chillies, agave syrup, salt and lemon juice with four tablespoons of olive oil. In a second small bowl, mix the yoghurt with a big pinch of salt, then thin with up to 50ml water until it’s the texture of double cream. Stir well, then top with the pistachio mixture.Tip the courgette mix on to the hot rice, tear in most of the mint leaves and fold in until well combined. Transfer to a platter, top with the remaining mint and serve with the salted pistachio yoghurt alongside.Explore more on these topicsRiceMeera Sodha recipesVegetablesFoodMain courseSide dishesVegetarian food and drinkNuts and seedsrecipesShareReuse this content"

Today’s one is flecked with courgettes (zucchini), toasted seeds, a pleasing hint of green chilli and plenty of cheddar – the more mature, the better. It is delicious in the extreme, and even more so when spread with pickled chilli butter. But first a year-round roast chicken, inspired by the red rices of Mexico, that fills the day with a happy glow. If ever there was a dish to sing for its supper …Roast chicken stuffed with tomato rice and smoky oregano butter (pictured top)I am endlessly in awe of the amount of umami unleashed by a simple braise of tomatoes, garlic and onion. Here, their sticky, sweet juices caramelise around the grains of rice and edges of the pan, producing a swashbuckling flavour-bomb that looks resplendent when it comes to the table.Prep15 minCook1 hr 30 minServes6–8250glong-grain rice1 large chicken(about 2kg)40gbutter1–2tbsp olive oil1 large onion, peeled and roughly choppedSea salt and black pepper1 thumb-sized piecefresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped50gsun-dried tomato paste1tbsp chipotle en adobo1tsp ground allspice260gcherry tomatoes, quartered, or a 400g tin500mlchicken stock, or water200mlwhite wineFor the butter1 fat garlic clove, peeled½tsp ground allspice1tsp sea salt1 handfulfresh oregano leaves, or thyme, roughly chopped1tbsp chipotle en adobo75groom-temperature butterSoak the rice in a bowl of cold water for 10 minutes and take the chicken out of the fridge so it comes up to room temperature.Put a casserole dish or large saucepan on a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add the butter and olive oil. Stir in the onion, season generously and sweat, stirring, for about 10 minutes.Add the ginger and garlic, cook, stirring, for three to four minutes more, then stir in the sun-dried tomato paste, chipotle and allspice. Stir in the tomatoes, then drain the rice and add that, too. Stir for a few minutes to coat the rice, then pour in the stock or water and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer, cook for 15 minutes, then take off the heat. By this time, the tomatoes will have started to break down and will be smelling fragrant and delicious, but the rice will not yet be fully cooked; you’ll finish it off in the oven later.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Meanwhile, make the butter: in a mortar or small blender, grind the garlic, allspice, salt and herbs to a paste, then work in the chipotle and butter until well combined.Put the chicken in a roasting tray and loosen the skin around the breast and thighs. Push two-thirds of the chipotle butter under the skin, then smear the rest all over the outside of the chicken. Stuff the bird with the part-cooked red rice, and scoop any that doesn’t fit inside bird into the roasting tray under the chicken. Pour in the wine, then roast for an hour and 15 minutes (allow 15 minutes per 500g of bird, plus 15 minutes, and you should be spot on), until the chicken is golden and the juices run clear when the thickest part of the thighs are pierced with a skewer. I usually cut between the thighs and body after 35 minutes, to allow the insides of the thighs to cook without risk of overcooking the breast. The chicken will emerge resplendent with that smoky tomato rice. Carve and serve.Courgette soda bread with pickled chilli butterView image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ courgette soda bread with pickled chilli butter.Alongside the roast chicken, this loaf, with additional cheese and a sprightly green salad, makes a stunning weekend lunch. It is also great slathered with cold salted butter and nothing else.Prep10 minCook1 hr 30 minMakes1 loaf250gcourgettes200gwhite spelt flour, plus extra for dusting130gwhite rye, wholemeal or emmer flour2tsp sea salt2tsp bicarbonate of soda100gmixed seeds, such as sunflower and pumpkin1½tsp fennel seeds120gmature cheddar, grated2 green chillies, finely diced300mlbuttermilkFor the butter250gsoftened butter3–4 large pickled chillies40gfresh dill, leaves picked2tsp sea saltFreshly ground black pepperBlitz all the ingredients for the butter in a small food processor until fully combined, then roll into a sausage, wrap in baking paper and chill until needed. It will keep happily for several weeks in the refrigerator.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 and put a baking sheet inside to heat up. Have ready a sheet of baking paper.Roughly grate the courgettes into a bowl, then squeeze them tightly with your hands to get rid of any excess liquid. Squeeze again in paper kitchen towels to extract every last bit of moisture, then set aside.Sift the flours, salt and bicarbonate of soda into a large bowl, then tip anything left in the sieve into the bowl.Put a frying pan on a medium heat and, once hot, gently toast the mixed seeds for five to six minutes, until they start to crackle and pop. Reserve a few tablespoons’ worth, then tip the rest into the flour bowl. Toast the fennel seeds in the same pan for a minute, then add to the flour. Tip in the squeezed courgettes, cheddar and chillies, and fold until they are all nicely coated in the flour.Make a well in the centre of the courgette mix, then pour in the buttermilk and, as quickly and deftly as you can, fold it in; the quicker you can do this, the lighter the soda bread will be. This is quite a sticky dough, so do not lose faith. Turn out on to a floured surface and, with flour-dusted hands, shape the dough into a round with authority and speed. Make a cross on the top with a sharp knife and sprinkle with the reserved toasted mixed seeds.Take the baking sheet out of the oven and line it with the reserved sheet of baking paper. Put the soda bread on top and bake for 40–45 minutes, until golden and hollow-sounding when you tap the base. Serve with the chilli butter. Wrapped and stored in a bread bin, the loaf will keep for several days.These recipes are edited extracts from Mexican Table by Thomasina Miers (Quadrille, £28).

In many cases this blunt question comes later, cushioned by a run of lighter questions.Or they will ask about other pretty personal aspects of your finances, such as how much rent do you pay, how much do you have stashed in savings, or what is your biggest money mistake or regret.Plenty of people seem to be happy to play ball. Within 40 seconds ofone interview, we have discovered that an architectural designer is on £38,000 a year. The interviewee is also willing to reveal the amount they have in savings, plus how much they expect to earn in the future.Inanother clip, a 60-year-old man is asked about his biggest financial regret. Not being bolder, he answers. When he was younger, there was a flat that he didn’t buy because, at the time it seemed really expensive – but it has leapt in value from £64,000 to about £1.8m.The clip, which has been viewed 1.3m times on Instagram, is part of afast-growing genre: short, street-style interviews that ask strangers highly personal questions about things such as their income, rent and job satisfaction.It is taking inspiration from the US, whereSalary Transparent Street– a channel seeking to normalise conversations around salaries – has amassed 1 million followers in four years.Those wielding the microphones say the interviews with Britons are helping to improve financial education and promote greater transparency on pay. Others would say it is about indulging our nosiness and trying to generate money by creating content that may go viral.For creators, the pitch is simple: ask some fairly personal questions, film the answers, and post them online for an audience hungry to know what others are earning, spending and regretting. It is money and work, after all, that are said to worry young peoplemore thansocial media, the climate crisis and culture war debates.“My ethos is to drive financial education through conversation,” says Gabriel Nussbaum, a personal finance content creator also known as “That Money Guy”. Nussbaum runsMoney Unfiltered, a channel he describes as “dedicated to interviewing the public about personal finance”.What appears to be a one-person band is, in reality, a well-oiled operation. “We have a team,” says Nussbaum, “and our objective is to get as wide a range of people as we can – different ages, different backgrounds, different genders.”View image in fullscreenGabriel Nussbaum, left, says the core theme is speaking to ‘regular’ people about money.Photograph: Harrison Kelly/Money UnfilteredThe channel, which was launched about six months ago, now averages 3m views a month, posting one piece of content each day onInstagramand TikTok.Is it as easy as simply thrusting a microphone in someone’s face and hoping for the best?“It’s about how you position the question, or the context that you give them,” saysAydan Al-Saad, an entrepreneur and content creator who asks people about their pay (among other things) and posts the resulting videos on Instagram and TikTok.“I might not always put this in the edit, but I’ll usually tell people I promote pay transparency, and want to make sure everyone feels they’re being paid fairly,” he adds.Why does it work? Part of the reason, says Nussbaum, is “you don’t get these conversations anywhere”. Salaries – particularly the actual figures – remain one of the “biggest taboo” in Britain, driven, in part, by confidentiality clauses, workplace norms and a deep-seated reluctance to discuss money (with the exception being house prices).This year, a survey by the job search site Indeed found British people were oftentoo “polite”to ask about pay.Now, creators such as Nussbaum and Saad are looking to fill the void. “The goal for me is transparency,” says Saad. “It’s about giving people visibility of what it’s like to work in different careers, how much money they can make and so on.”Beyond information-sharing, there’s also a psychological pull. “It’s a bit like reality TV, right? I could go viral by speaking to billionaires all the time,” Saad says, pointing to examples from the channelThe Venture Room, which interviews high net-worth individuals about their finances. “But people want to see real people and hear real things,” he adds.That is all very plausible, but for the person being interviewed, what is it like to share your salary and subsequently find your face plastered across the internet? “No one knows what it’s like to go viral until they’ve gone viral,” says Saad.“We’re not there to put people in a position where they’re uncomfortable,” he continues, adding that interviewees are able to contact his channel if they would like a post removed. “We’ll see it, we’ll remove it, no questions asked.”The comments on some channels are filtered with the aim of making them a safe space to discuss finances. However, a quick glance at the comments on some videos suggests they can invite a very public audit of private lives. See, for example, a discussion on living in London andwhether an income of £35,000 a year is enough to live comfortably or would mean barely scraping by.So how useful are these videos? Kim Stephenson, a psychologist and financial adviser, says: “It’s good in theory, as knowing is usually better than not knowing.”As a tool for comparison, though, they may be less useful than intended, says Vicky Reynal, a psychotherapist and the author of Money on Your Mind: The Psychology Behind Your Financial Habits. “Comparison is a human tendency that helps us evaluate how well, or poorly, we’re doing. But we’re more confused than we’ve ever been about how well, or how poorly, we’re doing.”The main problem, Reynal says, “is how each person will use the information. I’m sure some will watch them for entertainment, or even for reassurance, but there’s a lot who might use them to keep themselves stuck in a state of feeling dissatisfied, not good enough – as confirmation that they’re falling behind.”View image in fullscreenVicky Reynal worries that some people may use the videos as ‘confirmation that they’re falling behind’.Photograph: Rory Mulvey/The ObserverNussbaum says his main intention is for the videos to be helpful, while acknowledging the potential drawbacks. But the feedback, he says, has been “overwhelmingly positive”, with the videos “opening up people’s perceptions of what’s possible”.Saad agrees. “If one person can get value from a video, it’s worth posting,” he says, pointing to instances in which a video has helped a viewer to then receive a pay rise or change career.“Let’s say you hear of someone on this channel with a similar job, at a similar age, earning three times more than you,” says Nussbaum. “It might cause some negative feelings – but the flipside is that that person could also watch that video and think: ‘I’m being underpaid in my role, and I need to look around and look at other companies.’ The same video can have two completely polarising effects.”In theory, the videos should resonate more among gen Z, said to value salary transparency more than their peers. In reality, it is millennials who form a large chunk of their audience – more then 40% of Saad’s following is people aged 25-34, while more than 33% is 35-44.The statistics are, in part, a reflection of broader financial anxiety among millennials, with56% of the under-40ssaid to be considering delaying key milestones such as getting married, having a child or buying a house owing to financial pressures.What’s next for Nussbaum’s channel? “It’d be great to get more noticeable people on, and have a range of people open up about their finances,” he says. “Speaking to, say, an 18-year-old footballer and asking: ‘You’re earning £100,000 a year, how do you manage that?’”It’s a marked contrast to the story of your average renter, but Nussbaum maintains that his channel will retain its core theme of “speaking to regular people about their regular lives when it comes to money”.View image in fullscreenSo would Mancunians be forthcoming with how much they earn? Kimi Chaddah went to find out.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images‘Not today, thank you’It’s a sunny day in Manchester as I try my luck asking total strangers about their finances in the Castlefield, the Northern Quarter and Spinningfields, areas of the city that often busy with office workers. A prime crowd, I naively think. Over the course of the afternoon, I approach 30 people. One man smiles and appears to look interested before taking a deep breath and saying: “Not today, thank you”. Perhaps another day, I wonder?Others become hostile when I mention the media or personal finance. Most continue walking before I’ve had the chance to explain the piece that I’m doing.Only two of the 30 people I ask are willing to provide any information - one seemingly doing so as a gesture of sympathy after an interaction with a standoffish friend. Another requests no surname, no identifying information – a caution at odds with the carefree nature of the TikTokers’ videos. They tell me they are earning between £25,000 and £35,000, and do think salaries should be discussed more, but also “don’t want to be sued”.There are two things I learned from this exercise. The first is that the quickest way to turn a perfectly pleasant individual into a curt, tight-lipped stranger is to approach them in general, with or without a handheld microphone. The second is that people would rather talk about literally anything else – the bus timetable, the weather, the state of the city centre – than their earnings.So I didn’t come away with much in the way of hard numbers. But I did leave with the nagging sense that maybe I should have talked about mortgage rates instead.Explore more on these topicsPaySocial mediaTikTokInstagramFamily financesWork & careersDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I could sense that the train was approaching our destination, so shuffled down the berth, easing up the blind to find a ruby necklace of brake lights running parallel with the tracks.It had rained overnight and the road was slick, the sky a midnight blue, a D-shaped moon fading in the corner. Dawn was minutes away, and I could just make out the jumble of houses on hills, lights flicking on as though fireflies lay between their folds.I stepped into the corridor as the train curved around a lake that gleamed like a pool of pink metal as first light fell upon its surface. Around me, passengers were now zipping up bags, brushing their teeth and locking berths into place, pausing to look out of the windows as a pair of minarets rose into view like sharpened pencils. Istanbul’s skyline was coming into focus.View image in fullscreenThe writer and family on the Santa Claus Express in Finland.Photograph: Monisha RajeshFive days earlier, I’d set off from London St Pancras hoping to retrace the original route of the Orient Express via Paris, Vienna and Bucharest, with the final leg passing through Sofia. Journeying 2,450 miles by rail, I now felt a deep satisfaction as the doors banged open and the sound of the second call to prayer greeted me on the platform. But I felt something else too: a rekindling of my love affair with night trains.It all began in 2010, when I spent four monthsriding around on the trains of Indian Railways. At first the rail network represented little more than a mode of transport, a means to an end. But I soon realised that the trains possessed spirit and personality, each a character in its own right. As much as I enjoyed journeys by day – hot chai in one hand, fresh samosa in the other – and constant commotion around me, I relished the nights. It was after dark when I would find peace in the cool of the open doorway, talking to hawkers and ticket inspectors, making notes on the day gone by. As others slept, life beyond the carriage continued and I stayed awake to bear witness to it: a pack of pye-dogs being fed down an alley; bored drivers playing cards on car bonnets; the twentysomething winking at me from the back of her boyfriend’s moped as they careered towards the beach. Each moment felt like a gift, and while I hadn’t realised it at the time, I was already immersed in slow travel.I found passengers who travelled solely for the thrill of the night train: groups of colleagues, young families, honeymooning couplesThree years ago, I made that jaunt from London to Istanbul, which involved three sleeper services: a shabby old Nightjet from Paris to Vienna; the surprisingly smart Dacia from Vienna to Bucharest; and the severely delayed Sofia-Istanbul Express. Three extraordinary journeys with wildly differing compartments, companions and scenery. Still, the madness of sharing with strangers, drinking whisky at 10am and trying to sleep to trance music was enough to spark an adventure that would take me from Palermo to Peru as I documented the resurgence in night trains.View image in fullscreenNice-Ville station.Photograph: Peter Cavanagh/AlamyOnly a decade before, such journeys were fizzling out in Europe, the rise of budget airlines and high-speed rail leading to a cull of sleeper services. But who knew the world was going to shut down? After lockdown, rail travel began making its way back on to travellers’ radars. With climate change undeniable, people were keen to control their carbon footprints by exploring closer to home. Private companies, such as the Belgian–Dutch co-operative European Sleeper, popped up with plans to launch new sleepers across Europe, and existing operators – including Sweden’s Snälltåget and Austria’s Nightjet – wanted to extend routes, encouraged by campaign groups such asBack-on-TrackandOui au train de Nuit!.With a bucket list of trains in hand, some of which were yet to start running, I set off to discover whether sleeper trains still held an allure – and who was using them. It didn’t take long to find out as I swept up the wintry backbone of Sweden on the Norrland night train to Narvik, surrounded by a cohort of school teachers from Stockholm on a skiing weekend to Kiruna in Swedish Lapland. In the din of a neon-lit dining car they offered me creamed cod’s roe on crispbread while explaining where I could chase the northern lights. They told me they regularly used the sleeper for weekends away, in both summer and winter, preferring the overnight ride to frantic queues at the airport – and the fraught disposal of liquids, they added, shaking bottles of wine in my face.View image in fullscreenThe Brussels to Berlin sleeper passing through the Netherlands.Photograph: ANP/AlamyDuring the period of the midnight sun in Norway, I met Ludwig, a chief mate for the coastguard who commuted all the way to Tromsø at the northern tip of the country in a refusal to contribute to climate change. He had travelled the route more than 20 times and recounted his encounters with elderly women and happy drunks who shared their moonshine, presenting him with cured deer hearts in return for companionship. And on the Santa Claus Express in Finland, I tucked into smoky reindeer stew with my children, surrendering to the journey’s festive charms as snow fell around us, the train sweeping quietly up the country to the depths of Finnish Lapland, where the sun never rose and the howl of huskies carried across the treetops.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Carriages were sometimes too hot or too cold, blankets too thin, pillows too flat, and companions just too damn loud. I’d sometimes wake with a headache, dreading the border crossings where I’d have to haul my bags or sleep with my passport in hand to make checks faster and more efficient. But all was forgiven during those moments of pure magic, when I’d nudge up the blind, eager to see where we were. Would the sun be firing streaks into the sky? Would the moon be hanging on? I’d sit in my blanket, coffee in hand, watching as farmers fed their flocks and children caught my eye from bedroom windows, a friendly wave never failing to make my day.View image in fullscreenIn Istanbul ‘I looked out of the window as a pair of minarets rose into view like sharpened pencils.’Photograph: Mauritius Images/AlamyEven when we were delayed, no one seemed to mind – my fellow passengers shrugging, pottering around and enjoying the extra time to read, chat or snooze. Becausetimewas what these night trains were giving us. Time to reconnect with friends as we moved through the darkness, with nothing but our own reflections in the window to distract us as we drifted into a state of confession, or opened up to family as though locked in a therapist’s room for the night. I had time for myself too, time to slow down and shut off, watching as the world whipped by my window and my thoughts calmed to a kind of meditation.Since I began my journeys, new routes have opened, old routes have returned and the feeling is one of hope that night trains will stand the test of time. I don’t know what the future holds for them, but I know that when I board a night train and shift up to the window as we set off beneath the moonlight, it feels like coming home.Monisha Rajesh’s new book, Moonlight Express: Around the World by Night Train (Bloomsbury, £22), is published 28 August.

The couple were on the Isle of Harris, in the Outer Hebrides. “We’ve both always loved camping and getting out to remote spots, preferably on the coast,” Beasley says. “The west coast of Scotland is one of our favourite areas to explore.”‘The Cadillac, the shadow, the LA sky – it was all laid out for me’: Phil Stockbridge’s best phone pictureRead moreOn their first morning at Horgabost Campsite, with its views over Luskentyre beach and its Caribbean-style white sand and turquoise waters, they awoke to a thick sea fret. “As it burned away and lifted a little, the early morning sun shone through from the mountains behind and caused this crazy-looking ghost rainbow,” Beasley says. The pair didn’t lose their chance at this shot, “hence why Rach is standing in her pyjamas! I didn’t want to miss the moment, especially as it was positioned so perfectly over our van.”With that in mind, Beasley used the camera most immediately at hand: his iPhone 11. He applied no edits aside from cropping to a 4:3 ratio. “I made sure when taking it that I’d put the focus on Rach and that the sky wasn’t overexposed,” he adds. “I liked having my shadow in the shot, too. It makes for a nice triangular composition.”The pair had never seen anything like it before. While the mist stuck around for the rest of the day, casting an ethereal light on their surroundings, the ghost rainbow was soon gone.Explore more on these topicsPhotographySmart shotArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It smelled fantastic – magical almost – raw nature broken down into dark, crumbly, nutrient rich compost; not pungent and wet like in winter.We call it our black gold.

We water our heap when it feels dry, with the rainwater that collects in our water butt and rolls down the drainpipe from Dad’s shed.Compost contains bacteria known asMycobacteriumvaccaeand apparently inhaling or absorbing these bacteria stimulates serotonin production in the brain, making us feel happy and relaxed.

We feel very powerless and very sick and very tired,” said Amjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGO Network, who has been inGazaCity throughout the 22-month war.On Friday, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a globally recognised organisation that classifies the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition, found that three key thresholds for a declaration of famine had been met in the once bustling commercial and administrative hub.Only four famines have been declared by the IPC since it was established in 2004, mostrecently in Sudanlast year. “This famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,” the report said. It warned of an exponential increase in deaths if “a ceasefire is not implemented … and essential food supplies and basic … services are not restored immediately”.It is the most vulnerable among the Palestinians now living in Gaza City, thought to be between 500,00 and 800,000 people, that are most at risk, especially elderly people, the young, sick or socially isolated, aid officials have said.View image in fullscreenA camp in Gaza City. Only a fraction of the aid that is needed is making it into the territory, say aid agencies.Photograph: Enas Tantesh“I have nothing to cook and no money to buy firewood for cooking. We eat a little food in the morning to stop our hunger and a little more at night. I eat just some za’atar [spice mix], cheese or just salt with bread, no vegetables, nothing cooked,” said Sabah Antaiz, 55, who was displaced from the Tuffah neighbourhood in eastern Gaza City by recentIsraeli offensives.Antaiz has hypertension, diabetes and a heart condition. Her husband, 60, is very ill and cannot work or collect food. “We have no one left, no one to support me or even bring us food. I lost about 10 members of my family in an airstrike on Tuffah neighbourhood: my father, mother, nephews and nieces, the children of my brothers and sisters,” Antaiz said.Israeli authorities tightened theirexisting blockade of Gazaat the beginning of the conflict in October 2023 and imposed a two-month total ban on supplies in March and April. More has reached Gaza in recent weeks, though only a fraction of what is needed, aid agencies say. The price of sugar has gone from about $100 (£74) for a kilogram to about $7, but much else remains too expensive for the 90% of people who have no income. Tomatoes cost $30 a kg.View image in fullscreenIbtisam Saleh and her children have no food or source of income.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianIbtisam Saleh, 50, who lives in a tent in Gaza City after being displaced 20 times, said she had no food and no source of income. “What we have now comes only from aid or gifts. Before the war, I used to receive $100 each month from the Qatari embassy because I was divorced and had a son. But since the war began, we have not received anything,” Saleh said.Saleh eats one meal a day, usually lentils, though earlier this week a neighbour gave her a small bag of rice. “I do not have the strength to stand in line waiting to get my share [of any food aid]. One time I fainted while waiting. The sun was very hot and I am hypertensive. Because of the heat, my blood pressure dropped and I lost consciousness,” Saleh said.Along with the sick and elderly people, there are those who are destitute. After almost two years of displacement and deprivation, few in Gaza City have any physical or financial reserves.View image in fullscreenIbtisam Saleh: ‘What we have now comes only from aid or gifts.’Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The Guardian“This is a population that has been stripped of any resilience … They have absolutely nothing. There is no safety margin at all. They are right on the very edge,” said one UN aid official with oversight of operations across Gaza.There are deep concerns about the very north of Gaza, where thousands still live among ruins in the worst humanitarian conditions anywhere in the battered territory, though data there was insufficient forthe IPCto make a judgment on the category of the crisis.In Gaza City, families sleep in the open on streets without shelter or pack into crowded, damaged apartments or tented camps where flies, mosquitoes and infectious diseases are rife. Rubbish piles up everywhere and choking smoke from plastic burning on fires causes chronic coughs. In recent weeks, temperatures have soared.UK among 27 countries to demand press given immediate access to GazaRead moreRiham Kraiem, 35, lives in a tent in Gaza City with her unemployed husband and their 10 children aged between two and 18. They had to leave their home in Beit Hanoun, a now flattened northern town, three months ago. An Israeli military assault near the school where they were sheltering initially pushed them to Gaza City.“For the past three months, we haven’t received any money or aid. We no longer have money to buy anything, even though prices have come down,” Kraiem said. “My children ask for many things … They want me to make them sweets but I can’t because we have no money. We eat only two meals a day, one in the morning and one in the evening. This morning, I cooked a can of lentils and we ate that. In the evening, we usually eat thyme or cheese with bread and sometimes just bread alone.”Kraiem said she had no food supplies left. “We left some behind in our home when we fled, and the house was destroyed,” she said. “Yesterday, my son went to look for aid and got one kilogram of pasta and a can of tomato sauce. He was given it by a young man who had got it from a food distribution site. He came back feeling like he was flying from happiness.”Israel has rejected the findings of the IPC report, saying there is no famine in Gaza and that the findings were based on “Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests”.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesFamineUnited NationsIsraelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Inside, it was 1230 and, using only medieval tools and techniques and materials sourced locally or made on site,work had just begun on the castleof Guilbert Courtenay, a fictitious nobleman of relativelymodest means.Back then, the walls were half a metre high and no one had the faintest idea when – or, more to the point, whether – Chateau de Guédelon would ever be finished. No one, after all, had thought to build an early 13th-century castle by hand for about 750 years.View image in fullscreenMaryline Martin , the project manager, shows a tray of pigments made on site.Photograph: Jon Henley/The GuardianJust over a quarter of a century later, it still is not quite finished. But in the summer of 2025 it is, recognisably and rather splendidly, an early 13th-century French castle, complete with ramparts, turrets, vaulted great hall, chambers, chapel, kitchens and, a little way off in the woods, a working flour mill.It is also a living archaeological, architectural, cultural, historical, human and even scientific laboratory, praised and prized by everyone from medievalists and heritage restoration experts to professionals in the sustainable construction industry.“I’m not really sure what I thought would come of it. Back then, it sometimes felt like just … having fun with friends,” said Maryline Martin, Guédelon’s project manager since the start. “It’s been the most amazing adventure. And it’s worked in a way I never dreamed of.”Returning to Guédelon 25-plus years on provides something of a shock. What was once a bare, muddy expanse of rock-strewn ground dotted with the occasional artisan in a home-spun hemp tunic or a leather apron is now an actual medieval castle. There are also car parks, restaurants, shops, a smart eco-friendly office – and 310,000 visitors a year.If regional, EU and corporate money funded the hard early years, today the €7.5m raised annually from ticket, food and souvenir sales – including baskets, scarves and bookmarks, all made in Guédelon – pay the investment, running costs and 160 salaries of one of Burgundy’s biggest attractions.View image in fullscreenTwo stone-cutters follow 13th-century methods as they work on the construction of Chateau Guédelon.Photograph: Arnaud Finistre/AFP/Getty ImagesWhat it is most absolutely not, though, is a medieval theme park.“This is play, but serious play,” said Martin, unchanged bar her shock of grey hair. Along with Michel Guyot, who had already spent decades restoring a ruined local chateau, she was one of the founding figures of Guédelon, inspired by the madcap idea of building one entirely from scratch. Guyot has since retired from the project.“It’s about building to understand, inventing the future by rediscovering the past,” Martin said. “It’s actually thoroughly modern, in keeping with an era that values ecology and nature. We’re like a bird building its nest: we take only what we need, from nearby. It’s almost political.”View image in fullscreenQuarriers working at the construction site.Photograph: Arnaud Finistre/AFP/Getty ImagesGuédelon has quarriers, stone cutters, masons, joiners, blacksmiths, tilers, painters, carpenters, ropemakers, wheelwrights, carters and basketmakers – 60-odd artisans in all – building cob and rubblework walls, firing tiles, blending dyes and pigments, braiding rope and forging and beating nails, hinges and decorative ironwork.The sole concessions to modernity are safety boots for everyone, glasses for those cutting stone, and ropes and carabiner clips for people working on the castle’s medieval-style timber scaffolding (which itself must be health and safety approved).“It sounds trite, but it’s ‘back to the future’,” said Emmanuel de Tissot, the newly appointed managing director. “We’re on a collective quest, for fidelity, for accuracy. For truth, I suppose. Guédelon engages body, heart and mind. Visitors, too.”View image in fullscreenFlorian Renucci, master builder at Chateau Guédelon.Photograph: Clément GuérardThe typical visit here lasts five hours. A rapt crowd listens as Florian Renucci, master builder, explains that each beam of the great hall’s roof vaults is a single branch hewn from a single tree, respecting the strong “heart” of the wood. Guédelon joiners wereinstrumental in the rebuildingof the fire-damaged Notre Dame Cathedral.The Guédelon method, Renucci said, was to study the remains of castles and other buildings of the time when Philippe Auguste was king ofFrance, to consult scientists, historians, archaeologists and archives – and then to proceed by deduction and, most often, trial and error, until a working solution was found.This summer, the problem at hand is the main drawbridge. “We know – we can see – there were strategically placed openings in castle gatehouse walls,” he said. “We know pulleys existed. But that’s it. How did it work? In 1250, how exactly were two men able to raise and lower a 400-tonne drawbridge?”Sometimes, it can take years. The clay tile oven had to be dismantled and rebuilt five times before it worked: there was no intact 13th-century clay tile oven to copy. When masons failed to devise a waterproof mortar for the cistern, they took samples from a castle in the south of France and had them analysed in a university lab. And everyone lost sleep trying to figure out how to drop the keystone into the chapel roof.“A whole ecosystem of archaeological and scientific research and of empirical experimentation has evolved around us,” Renucci said, “with so many applications for now, and for the future. Restorers come to learn how to make materials you can’t buy any more; builders to see nature-friendly techniques that vanished decades ago.”Aerial view of the almost complete castle.Photograph: Denis GliksmanThose who work here love it. “I get to make things that will last, with my hands,” said Matthis Lacroix, 22, a blacksmith. Simon Malier, 26, a carpenter who studied materials engineering, appreciated “the time to get things right, the sense that what you’re doing has been done for millennia, the profound human knowledge you acquire”.Not all are permanent staff. Brittany Joyner, 42, an actor and longtime amateur woodworker from Los Angeles, was doing three months, between jobs. “What I love is, working by hand teaches you how to really read the wood,” she said. “You learn respect for the material. Power tools just obliterate all of that.”View image in fullscreenBrittany Joyner, an amateur woodworker, is spending three months at Chateau Guédelon between jobs as an actor in Los Angeles.Photograph: Jon Henley/The GuardianSome have been here decades. Trimming a beam, Nicolas Touchefeu, 44, said this was his 26th year, “because it’s how I like to work, with my hands. Simple as that.” Other were staying just days, as one of the eight- to 10 volunteers Guédelon takes on each week. “Hard, but so satisfying,” was the verdict of Philippe Beghdali, a nurse.View image in fullscreenEmployees in medieval clothing help establish the historically authentic ambience that has helped make the chateau Burgundy’s biggest tourist attraction.Photograph: Arnaud Finistre/AFP/Getty ImagesIn 1999, Martin reckoned the castle would be finished “by about 2020”. Now she thinks maybe “in five or six years”; the main tower, 30 metres high, still has to be topped off, while other elements are still incomplete. In truth, though, the answer is never: pretty soon, the north wall, the first to be built, is going to need repointing.In the time it has been under construction, said Martin, 50 Guédelon babies have been born. But time,as the Guardian wrote just over a quarter of a century ago, is relative when you’re building a medieval castle by hand. “That’s our real luxury,” she said. “We have the time to try, fail, try again. And so far, we’ve never not found a solution.”Explore more on these topicsFranceArchitectureEuropeTravel & leisurefeaturesShareReuse this content"

She was to take the vehicle in convoy with a British volunteer to Kramatorsk in the contested Donbas region.She arrived in Ukraine on 4 June and reportedly sustained “injuries incompatible with life” in a Russian drone strike on the morning of 11 June, according to a police file. The Kramatorsk district police department said her body “remains in an area of active hostilities, making it impossible to conduct evacuation measures” to transfer it to the forensic medical examination department.Based on this information, her relatives have asked for a death certificate to be issued either through local authorities or theForeign, Commonwealth and Development Office(FCDO). They said this would allow them to grieve properly for the “brave, capable and determined” mother of three and begin the probate process.Katarzyna Bylok, the founder of Aid Ukraine UK, told the PA Media news agency that issuing a death certificate could take months or years, as Lewis Marffy’s remains could not be safely recovered.She described the area where the volunteer was allegedly killed as a “kill zone”.“It leaves her family in a horrible red-tape limbo,” she said. “They will never get her body. But what they need is the ability to close her affairs. Her sons have their hands tied; they don’t have power of attorney.”View image in fullscreenAnnie Lewis Marffy with the green Toyota Rav4 she used to drive across Ukraine.Photograph: Aid Ukraine UK/PAThe family said: “All the family, the sisters and the sons, have been very disappointed at the reaction of the FCDO and the lack of response from the police.“After all this time, we haven’t got any report at all from the Ukrainian police. That has to come from Ukraine and would be sent to Devon and Cornwall police.”They said police had retained Lewis Marffy’s computer for analysis, which contained information that would help the family manage her affairs.“The family are desperate to get more information. Her sons have been told that their mother is missing, presumed dead,” they said.Bylok said there was an expedited process in Ukraine to certify deaths in cases where remains could not be recovered, though it still took six to 12 months. “There is enough evidence to prove that Annie is dead,” she said. “The procedures stating that you need to have remains or DNA for a death certificate need to be updated.”Lewis Marffy travelled throughEuropein convoy with a former soldier from Wales, who had to return to the UK after becoming unwell in Poland. After it was suggested she should hand the vehicle to Aid Ukraine teams in Lviv, she insisted she would continue her mission to deliver the supplies to the Ukrainian military in Kramatorsk.She contacted Aid Ukraine on the evening of 10 June, saying she was 55 minutes from her destination. After failing to hear from Lewis Marffy, Bylok posted a picture of her on Telegram and asked for information about her whereabouts. Police then contacted Bylok to say Lewis Marffy had been killed, she said.An FCDO spokesperson said: “We are supporting the family of a British woman who is missing in Ukraine and are in contact with the local authorities.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeUkraineEuropeDevonRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Critics say the 3,400-home settlement would split the territory in half.The Netherlands barred the far-right Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich from entering the country in July.‘Very sick and very tired’: the reality of famine for Gaza’s most vulnerableRead moreAfter Friday’s meeting, Veldkamp – a former ambassador to Israel – told the Dutch news agency ANP he was “insufficiently able to take meaningful additional measures”. In astatementannouncing his resignation, he said “we are living in a time of unprecedented geopolitical tension, where diplomacy matters more than ever”.Backing his stance,the NSC said its coalition partners, the centre-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the populist Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB), “refuse to acknowledge the alarming situation [in Gaza] and take necessary action”.There have been a number of protests in the Netherlands to pressure the government to take action against Israel’s war inGaza, which is nearing its two-year mark. Between 100,000 and 150,000 people took part in a demonstration in The Hague in June, making it the largest protest in the Netherlands in two decades.Veldkamp’s resignation came after UN-backed experts said on Friday that Gaza City and the surrounding area was in the grip ofan “entirely man-made” famine, and that deaths could rise exponentially. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has only declared four famines since it was established in 2004, most recentlyin Sudanlast year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photographs byJulia KochetovaSat 23 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTShareIn a branch of the Ukrainian coffee chain Lviv Croissants in the frontline city of Kramatorsk, there is a noticeboard where people leave coloured Post-it notes with simple hand-drawn messages. One just says “Kramatorsk”, with red hearts below and a yellow and blue semi-circular fan above, the colours ofUkraine.Among those looking at the notes is Bohdan, a 26-year-old, who has been serving in the army for the past three years. The soldier, now in logistics, has chosen to spend his one day off in Kramatorsk with his dog Arnold to photograph for himself recent Russian bombing on a city where he was based for 18 months.View image in fullscreenBohdan, a soldier, with his dog Arnold.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The Guardian“I have a history with this place,” he says. “It is part of my destiny and my puzzle.”Kramatorsk is the core of the 30% of Ukraine’s Donetsk oblast that its military still holds in the face of a grinding Russian advance. This week, the region was the subject of what appears to have been a failed negotiationbetween Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. The Russian president demanded all of Donetsk – which together with Luhansk oblast makes up theDonbas region– as part of a peace deal, a proposal that Trump seemed to have briefly endorsed even though Ukraine rejected it.Map showing areas controlled by Russia in Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblastsRussia’s arguments change, but in Putin’s eyes, Donetsk, traditionally a Russian-speaking industrial region in Ukraine’s east, is culturally closer to Moscow than Kyiv. People who live there, however, have a very different view. They show no interest in seeing the land of Donetsk given up; it is their land after all.A few minutes earlier, Bohdan had photographed the nearby site of a Russian bombing in the centre of the city on 31 July that had killed five, taking an image of a damaged tree in front of a ruined apartment block. His plan is to turn the image into a tattoo: “The tree is symbolic; like Ukraine, it holds on despite the strike.”View image in fullscreenBohdan’s tattoo with the dates and cities where Russian strikes killed more than 15 civilians. ‘These dates should stay with me,’ he says.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianIt is not his first body art. On the soldier’s left calf is a list of all Russian airstrikes that caused more than 15 civilian casualties anywhere in Ukraine. Bohdan had it done four months ago, while changing units. As the transition was taking place, he says, “I was having a civilian life, mostly. It was so easy to forget what’s going on.”The frontline is about 12 miles away at the nearest point, but Kramatorsk remains relatively lively in the daytime August sun. Though the air raid alarm goes off regularly, that is for missiles passing over, locals say; when an attack on the city does come, they add ominously, there is no warning.About a quarter of a million Ukrainian civilians live in Kramatorsk and the rest of Donetsk, about an eighth of pre-invasion levels. Many windows are boarded up, but the city is not significantly damaged. Some shops and cafes still open, such as Kateryna Seledtsova’s Sweet Coffee House Bakery, which has an array of fruit cakes, eclairs and other creamy-looking offerings behind the counter.View image in fullscreenKateryna Seledtsova, the owner of Sweet Coffee House Bakery, in front of her cafe.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianThe change in Kramatorsk’s population – it has become increasingly male–dominated because of the arrival of soldiers into the area – means that Seledtsova has refined her menu. “Men like simpler food,” she says, explaining that she had switched out French-style pastries for layered Napoleon cake or trubochki, waffle tubes filled with condensed milk. Whatever she bakes, she adds, sells out daily, such is the demand.Giving away the rest of Donetsk strikes Seledtsova “as idiocy. Men have been digging trenches here. All of those fortifications for nothing? I don’t believe it will happen, it is just stupid.” The baker’s life is here: Seledtsova is from Kramatorsk, the city also of her father and eight-year-old son, and the idea of being forced to move out is, she says, so hard to take seriously that it is best not thought about much.Could there be a price worth paying, giving up land in Ukraine, including where she lives, in return perhaps for Nato membership? She just sees practical complications: “There are already a lot of problems with evacuation. For example, it’s impossible for us just to go somewhere and buy or rent an apartment elsewhere in Ukraine because we don’t have the money.”Relocation programmes, she says, are not attractive because the housing offered is not comparable. “A lot of people who fled, as far as I know, are living in kindergartens. They don’t even have money to buy things like proper medicines,” and she wonders how the Ukrainian state with its limited resources would be able to make a programme work.What about staying under Russia? “I would never work under those motherfuckers. Of course no, no,” and giggles at the strength of her feeling.View image in fullscreenValentyna with her grandsons in the park in Sloviansk.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianIn Sloviansk, north of Kramatorsk, Valentyna and Yelena are with their grandsons aged five and six in the city’s well-tended central park. The children play in small electric cars, but thebabusyas(grandmothers) are frustrated. “You are a journalist, you could make some efforts for peace, we need to shout out for peace,” says Valentyna. Pressed on whether they believed giving up land could be acceptable, all Valentyna will say is that “we want the war to stop.”If Ukraine is forced to give up Donetsk they would flee if they have to, Valentyna says, because “the children have problems with their mental health. They are shaking during the nights.” In-person classes, lasting four hours a day, have been halted again as the security situation has deteriorated. “We were in a playground and we saw a Shahed drone just above our heads, flying so low, three days ago – and there were 10, 12 children who were playing there, just watching.”View image in fullscreenValentyna selling grapes from her garden at the market in Sloviansk.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianAt Sloviansk market, local people sell surplus produce from their gardens, some of the best agricultural land in the world. A woman, also called Valentyna, offers grapes for 80 hryvnia (£1.44) a kilo. “They are talking about trading people, like ancient times, when there was a lord and his serfs,” she says as she sells 2kg from the piles of red and white grapes on her table. “We should keep going and fighting for our lands. These are Ukrainian lands; there are recognised borders.”Trump needs to understand what the war in Ukraine is really about | Kenneth RothRead moreDonetsk province remains where the heaviest fighting is taking place along the long frontline, particularly around Pokrovsk, 35 miles south-west of Kramatorsk. Regional officials prove reluctant to give interviews, because of the political sensitivities of the moment, but Vadym Filashkin, the governor of Donestsk, reported on Thursday morning that three had been killed in Kostyantinivka, while on Friday settlements were attacked 26 times and 3,649 people were evacuated.The consequences of the unceasing war can be seen in nearby Pavlohrad, to the west, in a neighbouring region. A refugee centre has been operating in the city for nearly a year, to receive people with nowhere to go. But as the Russian offensive has intensified, the number of refugees arriving has increased to “350 to 450 people a day for the past two weeks”, according to Kateryna Makarova, the team leader on the site. It compares with 200 a day two months ago, and 100 during the winter.View image in fullscreenKateryna Makarova, a manager at the transit refugee centre in Pavlohrad, Dnipropetrovsk region.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianConditions at the site, a former cultural centre, are cramped. In an auditorium, beds are placed next to each other on the stage for those who cannot immediately be rehoused. An emergency dormitory shelter is being built in a tent to increase the overnight capacity from 100 to more than 200, though that is not obviously a solution when the weather turns. Another reception centre is being opened in the city of Dnipro, further west, Makarova adds.News reports indicate Trump’s peace efforts have gone nowhere. Few in and around Donetsk are surprised. Planning continues in Ukraine to deal with Russia’s gradual advance, attacks that show no sign of halting. Netting is being erected along the safest supply route into Kramatorsk before it can be targeted by Russia’s increasingly effective drone crews, though at the current rates of advance it will probably take years to conquer Donetsk, and at a cost of 30,000 Russian casualties a month.Nevertheless, it is prudent to plan for the worst. “We are trying to figure out the algorithm for how we should work when there will be more evacuations,” says Makarova. “There are a large amount of people living in Kramatorsk, Sloviansk and other towns, and if there will be an evacuation there, there will be a huge amount of people coming. We need to understand how to act in that situation.”View image in fullscreenNadiya and Serhii were evacuated from Mezhova, Dnipropetrovsk region, to the transit refugee centre in Pavlohrad.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianSerhii and Nadiya, a couple who have been married 46 years, are sitting out in the early evening sun with their lives’ possessions in a dozen or so plastic bags by them. They are not even from Donetsk, but Mezhova, 10 miles into Dnipropetrovsk oblast, victims of a metastasisation of the war that, for all Russia’s stated interest in Donetsk, is spreading beyond its borders. Serhii admits “we never thought the war would come to our village” until drone strikes began two months ago.The couple are surprisingly calm, in the circumstances, though Serhii admits to taking some Valium to help, and are hoping to join one of their daughters, whenever a volunteer can drive them from the refugee centre. Tonight, though, they are staying at the refugee centre and Nadiya comes over to say goodbye as we leave.“They [the Russians] are saying we’re brothers, but if I would have such a brother, I would change my last name and my father’s name,” Serhii says. “I don’t need this kind of brother.”"

This year, it braced to lose the last.The economic and social trends that have shuttered family-run pubs acrossIrelandappear remorseless, leaving many communities with nowhere to meet, have a drink and share stories.But this week Kilteely bucked the trend. The doomed bar reopened after 26 villagers clubbed together to buy it. “We felt we were going to be annexed into other communities if we didn’t have a place to meet and call our own,” said Liam Carroll. “So here we are, we’re publicans.”The new owners pooled their savings and formed a syndicate to buy the pub, which otherwise faced probable demolition and conversion into accommodation.View image in fullscreenThe new owners formed a syndicate and bought the bar and licence for €300,000.Photograph: Johnny Savage/The GuardianThe eclectic group – which includes a barrister, a solicitor, a pharmacist, a clinical psychologist, a carpenter, an accountant, a teacher, a signmaker, builders, farmers and electricians – bought the bar and licence for €300,000 (£260,000) and used its varied skills to reestablish and refurbish the business.Previously Ahern’s, the pub is now called the Street Bar, a reference to the local expression “heading up the street”, a euphemism for heading out for a pint. (Some syndicate members wanted to call it the Ambush, after a famous 1921 attack during the British-Irish war that killed 11 soldiers and police, but that was vetoed.)It has new wiring, a cool room for beer, Sky Sports and, tucked between wine and whiskey, a sign: “Welcome to the Street Bar. A community working together in Kilteely.” Another sign lists syndicate members.“We hope other communities will see that it can be done,” said Carroll, the barrister. “All these closures – it doesn’t have to happen.”Since 2005, Ireland has lost a quarter of its pubs: more than 2,100, averaging 112 a year, according to a study commissionedby the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland. The phenomenon is highest in rural areas. At county level, Limerick, in the south-west, recorded the highest decrease of 37.2%.View image in fullscreenThe closure of the pub would have left Kilteely’s main street empty of most businesses.Photograph: Johnny Savage/The GuardianMultiple reasons are cited: the cost of living, high taxes on alcohol, drink-driving laws, young people drinking less, preferences to drink at home, the Covid pandemic and shrinking profit margins. A similar trend hasclosed 15,000 pubs in England, Wales and Scotlandsince 2000, according to the British Beer and Pub Association.Having already lost post offices, shops and other pubs, the closure of Ahern’s – which had been kept afloat by Noreen Ahern, who is near retirement age, working an estimated 90 hours a week – would have left Kilteely’s main street empty and abandoned, save for a recycling business.Rather than mourn, some residents proposed a rescue based on an example from the County Waterford village of Rathgormack:in 2021, 19local people formed a syndicateto buy and run the last pub, which was due to close permanently.A group of 20 Kilteely residents each contributed €15,000 to meet the €300,000 price and turn the pub into a private limited company with a social enterprise ethos. “We made clear to all who invested that they should expect not to see a return of their money,” said Carroll.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The pub would remain a gathering point, he said. “This is where people have birthday parties or post-funeral receptions.”Daniel Kreith, 29, a solicitor and syndicate member originally from Galway, said his home village had lost nine of its 13 pubs. Kilteely showed that decline and oblivion were not inevitable, he said: “Some of them could have been saved.”The model appears to be spreading – County Kerry’sfirst community-owned pubis due to open soon.Bosco Ryan, 56, another Kilteely syndicate member, said stakeholders and their friends and families formed a network that could help sustain the Street. “We all have a responsibility to support it.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandHospitality industryPubsFood & drink industryEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The visit took place upon Wickremesinghe’s return from the G77 summit in Havana and the UN general assembly in New York.The offences carry a maximum punishment of 20 years in jail and an estimated fine of 16.6m rupees (£41,000).Wickremesinghe, who lost Sri Lanka’s last presidential election in September to the leftist leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, was said to be in stable condition after being brought to Colombo National hospital. The hospital’s deputy head, Rukshan Bellana, told the Agence France-Presse news agency that he had to be treated for acute dehydration. “He was a severe diabetic with high blood pressure when he was brought in,” Bellana said.Wickremesinghe became president in July 2022 after Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s resignation following months of protests driven by the country’s worst economic downturn since independence. Before assuming the presidency, Wickremesinghe, unpopular with protesters as he was seen as an ally of the Rajapaksa clan, hadbeen prime minister six timessince entering politics in 1977, though he never completed a term.In asignificant political shift for the countrylast September, Wickremesinghe was replaced by Dissanayake, the head of the leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party. The JVP has been tarred by its past involvement in some of the worst violence in the country’s history, and Dissanayake had sought to soften some of his party’s more hardline positions while attracting voters with promises to tackle corruption and abuses of power.Explore more on these topicsSri LankaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

But a closer look at the facts shows Anna has been dismissing calls for an inquiry since day one.”Dixon denies the claims and said she only voted against a Tory proposal for a national inquiry into grooming gangs because it included an amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill. She also rebutted suggestions that she opposes aBradforddistrict focus as part of the inquiry.Moore said he condemns threats of violence but said the video he posted “raises legitimate concerns” about Dixon’s position on a grooming gangs inquiry in Bradford.In a statement on Saturday Dixon said: “I want local residents to be aware that I have received threats of death and violence directly posted in response to a misleading video recently shared by the MP for Keighley and Ilkley, Robbie Moore.“These have been reported to the police, and an investigation is currently under way. It is irresponsible behaviour for any MP of any party to put out such blatant misinformation about a colleague.”Dixon added: “I have always been transparent and direct with constituents about my reasons for voting in favour of the government’s children’s wellbeing and schools bill in January 2025, and I am disturbed by Robbie Moore’s seeming willingness to spread misinformation on this scale with his constituents and beyond, particularly when it pertains to such a serious issue.“In January, the Conservative party put forward a proposal for a national inquiry into grooming gangs by introducing a wrecking amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill. If this amendment had passed, it would have effectively killed the bill, which aimed to enhance safeguards for children.“I am also shocked by the claim made in the video shared by Robbie Moore that I would oppose a Bradford district focus as part of a national inquiry into grooming gangs. This is extremely concerning when the video in question features extracts from an email I sent to one of my constituents on 6 August, the full text of which includes the statement: ‘If the national inquiry deems that another local inquiry is needed in Bradford, this is something I and the local authority will fully support.’ He has chosen to omit this from his video.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unfortunately, the MP for Shipley was not one of them.“We are now in a situation in Bradford where victims and survivors and leading child abuse lawyers are desperately calling for a focus on Bradford in the grooming gangs inquiry, with a sitting Labour peer explicitly saying there has been a cover-up inside Bradford council.“The fact that the MP for Shipley does not and, from her public comments today, still does not unequivocally support a focus on Bradford in this national inquiry is both a newsworthy and legitimate concern.”Explore more on these topicsBradfordLabourConservativesChildrenChild protectionUK child abuse inquirySexual violencenewsShareReuse this content"

His private member’s bill for an official inquiry into UK involvement in theIsrael-Gaza warwas blocked by the government at its second reading in July.Instead, the Peace and Justice Project, founded by Corbyn, is holding a two-day event called the “Gaza tribunal”. A website dedicated to the event says it will “examine Britain’s role in war crimes perpetrated in Gaza” by “hearing from experts and witnesses”, and “establish the full scale of our government’s complicity in the genocide against the Palestinian people”.Diane Abbott: I advised Jeremy Corbyn not to start new partyRead moreOn Saturday, Corbyn told an audience at the Edinburgh festival fringe that Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the occupiedPalestinian territories, would be offering her views to the hearings. He told the event that his “tribunal” would seek answers on the use of the RAF Akrotiri airbase around the war in Gaza, as well as other issues.Corbyn, interviewed on stage by the musician Calum Baird, said: “What we’ve done through the Peace and Justice Project is set up a two-day open public inquiry on 4 and 5 September in Church House in Westminster.“We’ve invited people to make submissions – lawyers and others and voices from Gaza and the West Bank and other places – in order to put forward their view on the policy. And Francesca Albanese has agreed to take part and put forward her view on the legality of it.”He said Albanese was “very keen to support it and get involved”, comparing his event to the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will remain in place until 7am on Sunday. A 37-year-old woman was arrested in the city on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker, Avon and Somerset police said, while in Liverpool there were 11 arrests for offences including being drunk and disorderly, assault and affray, as a UK Independence party protest was met by a counter-demonstration.In Horley, Surrey, about 200 anti-immigration protesters draped in St George and union flags clashed with roughly 50 Stand Up to Racism protesters in Bonehurst Road. The anti-racism protesters chanted: “Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here,” and held signs calling for solidarity and to “stop deportations”.They were met with a torrent of abuse from the anti-migration group, one of whom yelled through a megaphone: “You’re all scum and you should be ashamed.”Demonstrators and counter-protesters gathered outside the Radisson Blu hotel in Perth, with Abolish Asylum System supporters met by Perth Against Racism. Stand Up to Racism Scotland said it had achieved “victory” in the city, with more than 200 gathering to oppose the protest against asylum hotels.View image in fullscreenPolice separate rival protesters from Abolish Asylum System and Stand Up to Racism in Newcastle.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianThere has been continued tension around the use of the hotels to house asylum seekers. On Tuesday, the high court granted Epping Forest district council a temporary injunction to remove asylum seekers from the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex, from 12 September.Regular protests had been held outside the hotel in recent weeks after an asylum seeker was charged with trying to kiss a 14-year-old girl, which he denies.The government announced plans on Friday to appeal against the high court’s refusal to allow it to intervene in the case, and to further appeal against the temporary injunction.Other local councils have also announced their intention to seek legal advice as to whether they could achieve a similar injunction for hotels in their areas.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the talks show the enthusiasm with which the technology secretary has embraced the artificial intelligence sector, despite concerns over the accuracy of some chatbot responses andimplications for privacy and copyright.OpenAI offers free and subscription versions ofChatGPT. The paid version, ChatGPT Plus, costs $20 a month and gives users faster response times and priority access to new features.Kyle dined with Altman in March and April, according to transparency data released by the UK government. In July, Kyle signed an agreement with OpenAI to use AI in the UK’s public services. The non-binding deal could give OpenAI access to government data and lead to its software being used in education, defence, security and the justice system.View image in fullscreenSecretary of state for science, innovation and technology Peter Kyle.Photograph: Thomas Krych/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockKyle has been a vocal champion of AI within government and has also embraced its use in his own role. In March, it emerged that he hadasked ChatGPT for adviceon a range of work-related questions, including why British businesses were not adopting AI and what podcasts he should appear on.The minister told PoliticsHome in January: “ChatGPT is fantastically good, and where there are things that you really struggle to understand in depth, ChatGPT can be a very good tutor for it.”The UK is one of OpenAI’s top five markets for paid ChatGPT subscriptions. An OpenAI spokesperson said: “Millions of Brits are already using ChatGPT every day for free. In July, we signed an MoU [a memorandum of understanding] with the government to explore how we can best support the growth of AI in the UK, for the UK.“In line with the government’s vision of using this technology to unlock economic opportunity for everyday people, our shared goal is to democratise access to AI. The more people who can use it, the more widely its benefits will spread.”The company has been in talks with several governments in recent months and has agreed a deal with the United Arab Emirates to “enable ChatGPT nationwide” and use the technology in public sectors including transport, healthcare and education.The UK government has been keen to attract AI investment from the US,having struck dealswith OpenAI’s rivals Google and Anthropic earlier this year.Kyle has said that if a new UN security council were to be set up in a decade, technological clout – particularly in AI – would be a major factor in determining the most powerful countries. He told the Rest is Politics podcast in the spring: “I want us to be at the very forefront of [AI] because those countries will get to shape how it goes, how it is used and deployed.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are working with OpenAI and other leading AI companies to explore investment in UK infrastructure, improve public services and rigorously test the security of new technology before it is made public.”The science and technology department said it had not taken forward any proposal to give UK residents access to ChatGPT Plus or discussed it with other departments.Explore more on these topicsPeter KyleChatGPTOpenAISam AltmannewsShareReuse this content"

They were all treated at the scene for burns and smoke inhalation before being taken to hospital.A London fire brigade spokesperson said: “The brigade’s control officers received seven calls about the fire and mobilised crews from Ilford, Hainault, Leytonstone and Woodford fire stations to the scene. The fire was extinguished by 10.32pm.“The cause of the fire is being investigated by the brigade and the Metropolitan police service.” No arrests have been made.Alocal resident, Edward Thawe, 43, stepped outside his nearby home with his 12-year-old son to see whether he could help after hearing screaming on the road.The police and ambulance were already at the scene, which Thawe, a hospital porter, described as “horrible” and “more than scary” and something you did not “want to look at twice”.He said: “I heard screaming and people saying they had called the police. I came outside [the shop] and there was a man with his skin peeled off. His skin was burnt. I did not want to look at it.”DCI Mark Rogers, of the Met’s central specialist crime north unit, said: “We understand this incident will cause concern within the community. My team of specialist detectives are working at speed to piece the incident together.“Locals can expect to see a large police presence in the area. If you have any concerns, please speak to those officers on the ground.”Uniformed officers guarded the police cordon in place on Saturday as forensic officers in protective clothing examined the scene.A trail of what appeared to be bloody footprints along the pavement were found by a forensic officer.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, MP for Ilford North, posted on X: “Huge thanks to @metpoliceuk @LondonFire @Ldn_Ambulance for their response to a serious incident on Gants Hill/Woodford Avenue this evening.“Please avoid the area for now. Further updates will follow from @RedbridgeLive and emergency services.”Anyone with information is urged to contact the Met via 101, quoting 7559/22AUG.

He did not specify what those national security concerns are.Rhode Island’s governor, Dan McKee,criticizedthe stop-work order and said he and Connecticut’s governor, Ned Lamont, “will pursue every avenue to reverse the decision to halt work on Revolution Wind”, which was “just steps away from powering more than 350,000 homes”.Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, connected the decision to Trump’sreported pitchlast year to oil industry executives to trade $1bn in campaign donations for regulatory favors. “When the oil industry showed up at Mar-a-Lago with a set of demands in exchange for a $1 billion of campaign support for Trump, this is what they were asking for: the destruction of clean energy in America,” Murpy said in a statement.“This is a story of corruption, plain and simple. President Trump has sold our country out to big corporations with the oil and gas industry at the top of the list,” the senator added. “I will work with my colleagues and Governor Lamont to pursue all legal paths to get this project back on track.”Since returning to office, Trump has taken sweeping actions to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Throughout his time in public office, Trump hasrepeatedlybrought up his visceral hatred for wind power, apparently prompted by his belief that offshore turbines spoil the views at his golf courses, andhis embraceof the bizarre theory that “the noise causes cancer”.Trump recently called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or “farmer destroying Solar” projects.Rhode Island’s attorney general, Peter Neronha, said ina statementon Saturday that, without the Revolution Wind project, the state’s Act on Climate law, which aims to use renewable energy to battle global warming, “is dead in the water”.Scientists agree that nations need to rapidly embrace renewable energy to stave off the worst effects of climate change, including extreme heat and drought; larger, more intense wildfires and supercharged hurricanes, typhoons and rainstorms that lead to catastrophic flooding.Construction on Revolution Wind began in 2023, and the project was expected to be fully operational next year. Ørsted says it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction and considering legal proceedings.Revolution Wind is located more than 15 miles (24km) south of theRhode Islandcoast, 32 miles (51km) south-east of the Connecticut coast and 12 miles (19km) south-west of Martha’s Vineyard. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The densely populated states have minimal space available for land-based energy projects, which is why the offshore wind project is considered crucial for the states to meet their climate goals.BP agrees to sell US onshore wind business as it shifts back to oilRead moreWind power is the largest source of renewable energy in the US and provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation.Green Oceans, a non-profit thatopposes the offshore wind industry, andsued in federal courtlast year to stop the 83,798-acre (33,912-hectare) Revolution Wind project on environmental grounds, applauded the decision. “We are grateful that the Trump Administration and the federal government are taking meaningful action to preserve the fragile ocean environment off the coasts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts,” the non-profit said in a statement.This is the second major offshore wind project the Trump White House has halted. Work was previously stopped on Empire Wind, a New York offshore wind project, but construction was allowed to resume after New York’s governor,Kathy Hochul, and senatorChuck Schumerintervened.“This administration has it exactly backwards. It’s trying to prop up clunky, polluting coal plants while doing all it can to halt the fastest growing energy sources of the future – solar and wind power,” Kit Kennedy, managing director for the power division at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. “Unfortunately, every American is paying the price for these misguided decisions.”The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS newsRhode IslandConnecticutWind powerRenewable energyEnergyTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The incumbent mayor,Eric Adams, running as an independent, raised $425,181, with an average donation of $770. Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa brought in $407, 332.‘A new political era’: fresh Democratic faces seek office to prevent their party from ‘sleepwalking into dystopia’Read moreMamdani’s fundraising dominance is mirrored in a polling advantage. Last week, a Siena poll placed him at 19 points ahead of Cuomo, his nearest rival, who is also running as an independent.A 12-poll averagefrom Decision Desk HQ puts Mamdani ahead of Cuomo by 13 points.Mamdani, who has proposed rent freezes on almost a million rent-stabilized apartments in the city, free buses and childcare, city-run grocery stores, and elevated taxes on Columbia andNew YorkUniversity to subsidize city colleges and trade schools, has been consistently ahead in fundraising over rivals.In March, he asked his campaign’s grassroots supporters to stop donating, and directed his primary campaign staff to encourage supporters’ focus to volunteering efforts. His campaign funds on hand are put at $4.4m, and his campaign is eligible for $2.2m more in matching public funds.Last week, it was revealed that the anti-billionaire candidate had received a donation of $250,000 to a political action committee from Elizabeth Simons, the daughter of late hedge fund billionaire Jamie Simons.Adams is barred from receiving matching campaign funds, the city campaign finance board having found he had violated related laws. Cuomo has begun transferring money from a $7.5m state campaign account to his city campaign account and has $1.2m on hand. Cuomo is in line for a payout of about $400,000 from public funds.Pressure on the two trailing candidates, Adams and Sliwa, to step out of the race is likely to increase next month, but both have said they are unwilling to do so.Last week, Adams repeated his resistance to dropping out after a close adviser, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, was indicted for allegedly running a political-favors scheme that included receiving seafood and an acting role opposite Forest Whitaker.Politco reportedlast week that Cuomo told supporters at a fundraiser he expects Republican leaders, including Donald Trump, to urge Republican voters to switch from Sliwa to stop Mamdani, whom Trump has branded “a 100% Communist Lunatic”. Mamdani has said he is “Donald Trump’s worst nightmare”.Cuomo said on Friday that “a lot is going to happen” between now and the November vote. “I don’t think the public even knows who the assemblyman is, what he represents, what his positions are. So I think the more they find out about him, the less they’re going to like him, and … his appeal is going to drop dramatically.”Mamdani, meanwhile, has accused Cuomo of lying about his coordination with Trump and says the former governor, who bitterly clashed with Trump while in office, is now seeking the president’s help.“It’s par for the course for Andrew Cuomo,”Mamdani said on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniDemocratsAndrew CuomoEric AdamsNew YorkUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Enough is enough. No more American taxpayer dollars to Nethanyahu’s [sic] war machine.”Sanders, who also pushed resolutions to ban selling US weapons to Israel, has long been consistent about his concern regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza amid the war.Marjorie Taylor Greene, the outspoken, far-right Georgia Republican, also called for greater compassion for Palestinians in a social media post Saturday, a day after UN secretary general António Gutteres described the famine in the territory as a “failure of humanity”.The US representative, in a departure from the majority of her peers in Congress, described the Gaza humanitarian crisis as a genocide last month. In along post on X, she then said that while Israel’s war against Hamas was justified, the suffering of civilians was not.“Does Hamas deserve it? Yes,” Greene wrote, in part. “Do innocent people and children deserve it? No.”“The innocent people in Gaza did not kill and kidnap the innocent people in Israel on Oct 7th,” she continued. “Just as we spoke out and had compassion for the victims and families of Oct7, how can Americans not speak out and have compassion for the masses of innocent people and children in Gaza?”Greene linked the entirety of US financial and military aid to Israel to the conflict, arguing that it “means every U.S. tax payer is contributing to Israel’s military actions”.“I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to pay for genocide in a foreign country against a foreign people for a foreign war that I had nothing to do with,” Greene concluded. “And I will not be silent about it.”The post received an almost immediate response from far-right influencer Laura Loomer, who reportedly petitioned the White Houseto suspendthe entry of injured Palestinian children from Gaza to the US.Greene and Loomer, both claiming the mantle of Maga authenticity, have bitterly clashed on the issue, withLoomerfalsely describing Palestinian children as a “national security threat” and “Islamic invaders”.Loomer, who is Jewish, once claimed that her ban from social media platforms for anti-Muslim hate speech was antisemitic, while Greene infamously shared an antisemitic conspiracy theory that wildfires in California might have been started by Jewish space lasers.On Saturday, Loomer hit out at Greene, falsely accusing her of calling for Palestinians from Gaza to be resettled in the US and asking: “Why are you advocating for GAZANS to come to the US? How is Islamic immigration ‘America First’?”Marjorie Taylor Greene says Republican party has lost touch with its baseRead moreThe UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)saidlast week that parts of Gaza are experiencing a “man-made” famine in the Gaza governorate, which includes Gaza City, site of a new Israeli offensive.“As thisFamineis entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,” the report said. “The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed.”The Israeli agency heading aid distribution in Gaza, the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), rejected the report, saying it “relies on partial, biased data and superficial information originating from Hamas”.On Saturday, Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel,said on Xthat “the [international] media is missing the real story of ‘famine’ in Gaza. Hostages ARE starving, Hamas is getting fat, & the UN declares famine while 92% of THEIR food is stolen to be sold by Hamas. Meanwhile UN food sits rotting in sun. The UN should declare itself corrupt & incompetent.”In her post, Greene wrote that if the US were being bombed day and night, with millions killed or injured, and the world said “Americans voted for their government so they deserve it… How would you feel?

Later that day, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) notified his attorneys that he would be deported toUgandaand should report to immigration authorities on Monday.Kilmar Ábrego García released from criminal custody after court orderRead moreAccording toofficial documents posted online, the DHS told Ábrego’s attorneys on Friday afternoon that the “DHS may remove your client … to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends)”.Immigration and Customs Enforcement also directed Ábrego to report to its Baltimore office on Monday,according torecords posted online.Ábrego entered the US without permission in about 2011 as a teenager after fleeing gang violence. He was subsequentlyaffordeda federal protection order against deportation to El Salvador.The 30-year-old was initially deported by federal immigration officials in March. Though the Trump administration admitted that Ábrego’s deportation was an“administrative error”, officials have repeatedly accused him of being affiliated with the MS-13 gang, a claim Ábrego and his family vehemently deny.During his detention at El Salvador’s so-called Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), Ábrego was physically and psychologically tortured,according tocourt documents filed by his lawyers in July.Following Ábrego’s wrongful deportation, theTrump administrationfaced widespread pressure to return him to the US, including from a supreme court order that directed federal officials to “facilitate” his return.In June, the Trump administrationreturnedÁbrego from El Salvador, only to charge him with crimes related to human smuggling, which his lawyers have rejected as “preposterous”. His criminal trial is expected to begin in January.Before his deportation, Ábregohad livedin Maryland for more than a decade, working in construction while being married to an American wife.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those fears were somewhat allayed by a recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland, which requires immigration officials to allow Ábrego time to mount a defense.Separately, in a statement earlier this week, Uganda said that it agreed to a “temporary agreement” with the US to accept some asylum seekers who are deported from the country.Bagiire Vincent Waiswa, permanent secretary of Uganda’s foreign ministry,said: “The agreement is in respect of third country nationals who may not be granted asylum in the United States but are reluctant to or may have concerns about returning to their countries of origin.”Waiswa added: “This is a temporary arrangement with conditions including that individuals with criminal records and unaccompanied minors will not be accepted.

They have to make decisions that are very important.”Arsenal put five past Leeds but lose Ødegaard and Saka to injuryRead moreSpurs had agreed a fee with Crystal Palace for Eze but Arsenalstole in to get him for £60mplus £7.5m in add-ons. They had held the upper hand over Spurs all summer in that Eze always preferred to go to them, having supported them as a kid and played for their academy between the ages of eight and 13. But Arteta suggested it was dramatic and “one of the fastest” transfers in the end.Eze was presented to the Emirates Stadium crowd before Saturday’s5-0 win over Leeds,which featured an assured debut from the 15-year-old midfielder Max Dowman, who came on as a 64th-minute substitute, but was marred by injuries to Martin Ødegaard (shoulder) and Bukayo Saka (hamstring).“I think he [Eze] has the capacity to create these magic moments,” Arteta said. “He’s got that flair, that charisma that is very contagious. We know he can play as an attacking midfielder, right or left. He doesn’t care. He plays shifted off the left, as well. I’m sure we will find the right place for him.”Saka’s injury appeared to be more serious than that of the captain and the timing is bad, with Arsenal going to Liverpool next Sunday. “For Bukayo to come off, for sure it looks like something that is significant,” Arteta said. “He felt something in his hamstring while he was sprinting.

Witnessing how the visitors caused Pep Guardiola’s men headaches caused one wag to question if Eze might change his mind (again) about which club to join.Guardiola defends Trafford selection after Manchester City’s defeat by SpursRead moreSpurs missed a number of chances but were far more cutthroat than their hosts, as Brennan Johnson and João Palhinha’s first-half goals took the points back to north London.Two illustrations: towards the end, Jérémy Doku wriggled through and found his fellow substitute Phil Foden but Micky van de Ven chopped the ball away; moments after, Bernardo Silva headed on to the roof of the net.City were just not allowed to enjoy any rhythm. Instead they were a discordant bunch who kept finding a Spurs player rushing up to undermine their composure.“Good vibes” was Guardiola’s description of the mood as City hoped to banish the spectre oflast November’s 4-0 humiliationhere by Spurs, though an ill augury came in a Rico Lewis-James Trafford mix-up. Hesitation between the right-back and the new goalkeeper, preferred to Ederson, allowed Richarlison to pounce. While City escaped, Trafford’s performance was one to watch.View image in fullscreenJoão Palhinha is congratulated after making it 2-0 to Spurs just before half-time, the Portuguese midfielder’s first goal for the club.Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty ImagesOmarMarmoush fashioned an opening when Erling Haaland lit up the contest with a bulldozing run that splayed those in black. After a lucky ricochet when challenged, the centre-forward slipped in the Egyptian: he took a glance and unloaded but Guglielmo Vicario repelled the shot.Guardiola always enthuses about Frank’s managerial smarts and 35 minutes in the Dane showed how he already has Spurs drilled. Along the right Mohammed Kudus outfoxed Rúben Dias and put Richarlison through. The Brazilian ran forward, squared for Johnson and the forward beat Trafford: the shot was close to the keeper but was hit hard so he may claim mitigation if Guardiola scolds him about it.The flag went up but the semi-automatic offside technology showed Richarlison had been onside. The goal stood, and Spurs’ celebrations were soon to double.Now, Trafford’s shakiness came home to roost. The keeper dawdled when playing out, finally plumping for Nico González. The midfielder did not want it delivered close to his penalty spot anyway but Trafford passed only to Pape Matar Sarr and the ball went to Richarlison. He tried to shoot and failed, though the excellent Palhinha did, driving the ball home on his full debut.City were a mess and Guardiola’s decision to choose Trafford over Ederson cast as quaint, however the Brazilian views his future (he may leave for Galatasaray) – he is still an employee, after all.The disarray of those in blue was summed up by two moments at the other end. Attack is supposed to be their forte. But first Rayan Cherki aped a pub footballer by hitting the first defender from a corner; then Haaland headed the same player’s delivery to the heavens with Vicario’s goal gaping.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The reaction showed how bitty his side’s patterns were. At play in Spurs’ ascendancy was City’s greater ball share (60-40) not transmitting into the relentless pass and move of their finest years.View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola shows his frustration as his side slip to a worrying defeat.Photograph: Darren Staples/AFP/Getty ImagesInstead of fluency, Guardiola’s men hoped to prosper on scraps and moments. One came when Vicario did an unwitting impression of Trafford: the keeper passed sideways to Van de Ven, who must have cursed the Italian as he had Oscar Bobb for company. The Norwegian pilfered possession and tapped to Haaland, who passed to Cherki; at close range the Frenchman went to pull the trigger but Palhinha, Spurs’ star act, snuffed out the danger.Guardiola began the day with no Foden, Rodri, Silva, Doku and Ederson (all substitutes), or Manuel Akanji (left out completely for tactical reasons), yet could still field Haaland, Cherki, Marmoush, Tijjani Reijnders and Bobb.By the 54th minute Cherki and Marmoush were hooked – for Silva and Doku – and still City were amateurish. For example, at a corner the ball popped up sweetly for Lewis to let fly from outside the area – he did, into the gods.In the 74th minute Foden and Rodri wandered on – the Spaniard for his first action since being injured inCity’s 4-3 defeat against Al-Hilalat the Club World Cup in early July. Instantly, Rodri leaped to meet a corner but headed the ball into Vicario’s gloves.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I felt like my arm was shutting down a little bit when I was hitting forehands and on the serve. It kind of got progressively worse. Then on the grass it got quite painful. So I didn’t know what I was dealing with.“After the grass, I got it checked out. I had some bone stress, bone bruising, in my humerus on my left side. It is one of those where, if you keep playing with it, it could become very, very serious. So I had to take some time out. Saying that, it was not so bad, because I could obviously do a lot of other things as well physically. It wasn’t like I had to stop completely.”Although he was in pain at times during the grass season, Draper does not believe the injury played any role in his Wimbledon loss, which he said was purely down to his struggles to adapt to the surface.“It’s an injury which takes time to heal,” said Draper. “A bone can heal, but it might be giving me some discomfort, that’s for sure. It’s not something which I’m going to go out on Monday and feel like it’s holding me back at all. But at the same time, I have been looking after this for the last month or so, so I’m looking forward to just getting back to competing. I think that will take my mind off a lot of things. I don’t feel like I’ll be holding back at all.”Explore more on these topicsJack DraperUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

I saw 175 metres to go and had to start sprinting, I’m really happy it worked out for us.“After my crash in the Tour, I was really disappointed to be out … it was a setback. This was a nice goal, but I knew we only had one chance because there aren’t many opportunities for a sprinter like me at this Vuelta.”As the Vuelta made its first start in Italy on the largely flat 186.1 km (115.6 miles) ride from Turin to the town of Novara, which has hosted two Giro d’Italia finishes, six riders formed a breakaway and opened up a two-minute lead.However, the peloton, controlled mainly by Alpecin-Deceuninck and Lidl-Trek, did its best to ensure the breakaway did not build a bigger lead.Alessandro Verre claimed King of the Mountains points on the only categorised climb of the day on the ascent at La Serra, edging Joel Nicolau to the summit.View image in fullscreenThe pack rides in Zubiena during the first stage of the Vuelta a España.Photograph: Marco Bertorello/AFP/Getty ImagesHugo de la Calle then launched an audacious solo attack with 83km to go while the peloton swallowed up the rest of the breakaway group and the Spanish rider stayed out in front to steadily build a lead.With 50km to go, De la Calle had a lead of about 40 seconds but the peloton was well in control, shaving 20 seconds off in the next 10km.But with no rider alongside him, the tiring De la Calle was inevitably caught with 38km left, setting the stage for the sprint to the finish line.From then on, Alpecin-Deceuninck and Lidl-Trek took up their positions at the front before Philipsen had his day in the Italian sunshine.Explore more on these topicsVuelta a EspañaCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

Gu was flown the following day to the main South Island city of Christchurch for medical imaging.“Unfortunately, a very terrible accident occurred yesterday due to a man-made accident,” Gu posted on the Chinese social media site Weibo on which she has 6.7m followers.“Early this morning we flew to Christchurch for a medical imaging examination. I hope I can return to the snow soon, but I’m still waiting for the final confirmation of the expert team.”No further details of Gu’s injury or condition were available. Gu, who has not provided an update since her post on 16 August, had only recently returned from a shoulder injury which caused her to miss the Asian Winter Games.San Francisco-born Gu changed her allegiance to China to compete at the 2022 Beijing Olympic Games at which she won two gold medals in freestyle skiing at the age of 18. She will represent China again at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina, Italy.Gu’s post on Weibo suggested an over-enthusiastic fan may have played a role in her injury.“I have to concentrate fully during training, especially when I am preparing to start as it’s very dangerous to be interrupted,” she said. “I also have to focus on picturing and imagining the moves while on the cable car.“In order to save time, I don’t have lunch breaks and try to use the bathroom as little as possible. So please don’t record or take photos while I’m training.”Gu was the second-highest earning female athlete in 2023 with $22.1m, behind tennis star Iga Swiatek, according to the Forbes list.Explore more on these topicsSkiingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The Norwegian Ski Federation admitted after the competition that the team had manipulated the suits, but said the ski jumpers were not at fault for the violations.The FIS Ethics Commission said Lindvik and Forfang had admitted to breaching competition rules and had agreed they should have asked questions about the adjustments to their suits. “Johann Forfang and Marius Lindvik are therefore willing to accept the proposed sanctions of a period of ineligibility of three months, from which the period of the provisional suspension already served shall be deducted,” the ruling body said. The pair have agreed to pay fines of 2,000 Swiss francs (£1,800) each.“The case shows that routines for communication between the support staff handling equipment and suits and the athletes should be improved to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future,” their lawyers said.The suspensions will end well before next year’s Milano-Cortina Olympics where Lindvik will hope to defend his large hill title.

We certainly can’t go through the season with no recognised striker at the football club – and that’s no disrespect to Will Osula.“I think he’s doing really well and he’s progressing really well, but he’s got limited experience in the Premier League, although I’m really happy with his career progression.“But Alex at the moment would be the only striker we have with Premier League history of goals and appearances and starts, so we can’t leave ourselves in that position.”The 22-year-old Osula has not started a Premier League game since his £10m arrival from Sheffield United a year ago, and it was left to Anthony Gordon to line up in a largely unaccustomed central role in last weekend’s0-0 draw at Aston Villa, one he is likely to reprise against Liverpool on Monday evening.Asked how challenging it is for Gordon to play as a No 9, something he did to great effect in England’s 2023 European Under-21 Championship-winning team, Howe said: “He’s an attacker and he’s a very good attacker. The beauty of Anthony when we signed him was he can play right, left and potentially down the middle, something that he has done before. He’s done it for England, so it’s not something totally new to him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s not trying to be Alex, he’s got to be himself. If he’d scored against Aston Villa, you’d go, ‘that’s the perfect No 9 performance’. I think he had seven shots in the game, he looked a threat, he got a man sent off.“He was using his qualities, which are his pace and his dribbling skills, so I thought it was a really good performance from him.

Goals from Josh Cullen, newly installed as captain, and Jaidon Anthony mean they are already halfway to that tally, while Sunderland were given a harsh lesson in the reality of the top flightafter their opening winagainst West Ham.Cullen’s predecessor, Josh Brownhill, was instrumental in bringingBurnleyup and his replacement set the tone with a fine opener and an assist for the second. Turf Moor was clearly nervous from the off, with memories of earning 10 points here two seasons ago fresh in the mind. The victory was hard-earned through discipline, graft and one of the few moments of quality in the 90 minutes to offer hope that this time may be different for Burnley after becoming a yo-yo club.Arsenal v Leeds: Premier League – liveRead moreScott Parker, the Burnley manager, said: “I’m absolutely buzzing, first and foremost, for the players and for the fans and everyone involved. We were brilliant.“The main thing for our first home game, we needed to make these fans believe. We need to make them feel or illustrate to our fans what we’re capable of this year. Our fans were superb. Our players gave them that belief. They’re going to be vitally important this year.“As a football club, I can’t do this on my own. These 20, 30-odd players can’t do this on their own. It’s going to need the whole club to support, to get behind us, to buckle in at times for the bumpy road and the challenge we face.”Survival will be built on what happens in home games. On their wayto promotion under Parkerlast season they did not lose , although nine draws indicate they did not always dominate. The defence had a summer shake-up and looked fragile inlast week’s loss at Tottenhamand they should have been behind within five minutes here.Granit Xhaka’s free-kick found Dan Ballard, who knocked the ball down to Eliezer Mayenda to shoot from close range, only for Martin Dubravka produce a fine save from a miscue. This would prove to be the only shot on target in a turgid first half.View image in fullscreenJaidon Anthony slots the ball past Sunderland's keeper Robin Roefs to seal victory for Burnley.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersBurnley will need luck if they are to survive and they thought they had found some. A direct ball was won by Anthony and then Lyle Foster got the better of the substitute Jenson Seelt, before beating Robin Roefs. The goal music blared, Foster ran to the corner to celebrate and did not hear Michael Salisbury’s whistle, the referee having deemed the South African had fouled the defender.If the first half was devoid of quality, the tenor changed within two minutes of the second. Quilindschy Hartman, who goes by Q in these parts, collected a loose pass on the left and drilled it into Anthony, whose perfect flick found Cullen and the Burnley captain curled the ball into the bottom corner from 15 yards. The video assistant referee tried to ruin the fun with a strangely lengthy check for an offside that never was. Burnley were up and running.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There was, however, cause for worry soon after when the floodlights kept flashing and the game was stopped as it was causing a distraction on the pitch because it is not traditional to have a mid-match lights show.Burnley were always there to pressure opponents and put bodies on the line. Chasing lost causes and pressing those in black was a key trait to the end, aided by the experience of Kyle Walker and relentless energy provided by Hannibal Mejbri. The performance was summed up by Maxime Estève going down with cramp after making a critical interception. It meantSunderlandwere not afforded a chance to equalise.“It’s not a surprise for me, it’s not a surprise for the players, for the club,” Régis Le Bris, the visiting manager, said of the Premier League’s quality. “I don’t know for the fans, I’m not sure, because they know how tough this league is. You enjoy when you win, but you won’t be too negative when you lose.”It was the foundations that were tested more than the electricity supply with two minutes remaining. With Sunderland chasing the match, there was space to be enjoyed for once and Cullen flashed a sublime pass through the defence for Anthony to latch on to, before rounding the goalkeeper and finishing. Sometimes it is better to be good than lucky.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBurnleySunderlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Gimmers of promises. Green shoots. It is indicative of just how far Manchester United have sunk that the reaction to their1-0 defeat to Arsenallast Sunday was not shock or scorn or even schadenfreude; it was encouragement. United used to inspire fear in opponents; now they inspire pity.It is not that there were no reasons for optimism for United. The new forwards who started, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, looked intermittently dangerous. Mason Mount offered a reminder of his quality and if he can stay fit he could have a major role to play. Patrick Dorgu dominated his flank. Amad Diallo sparkled after coming off the bench. David Raya was forced to make seven saves. Dorgu hit a post. There were plausible claims for a penalty when William Saliba appeared to go through the back of Cunha. Opta’s xG model had United winning 1.5 to 1.3.Manchester United close on signing Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens in €20m dealRead moreFans looking for crumbs of comfortcould have found enough to make a decent meal for a small bird. After months of United being terrible, they looked OK. But they still lost. Already they are three points behind the leaders and, given the context, there is inevitably already pressure. It is probably just as well they face Fulham away on Sunday, because Fulham away is as near to a sure thing as there is for United these days. Not since 2009 have Fulham beaten Manchester United at home. They have managed one draw in the nine games. Craven Cottage is the one ground where United can feel safe, a time capsule in which Alex Ferguson still glowers from the dugout, Roy Keane still dominates the midfield and Ryan Giggs still speeds down the wing.United need to win. If they do not,Ruben Amorimwill be back to having the worst win percentage of any United manager since Herbert Bamlett, whose contract was not renewed after relegation in 1931. In some ways that is a quirk, a freak stat that does not take into account the weirdness of last season. But it is also a reminder of just how bad United have been under Erik ten Hag’s successor. There is no credit in the bank. To believe that Amorim is the right manager for United is an act of faith.That is not to say that it is misplaced; Amorim looked a very impressive manager at Sporting and he inherited an extremely difficult situation. But it does perhaps explain why there has been such eagerness to magnify the few fragments of optimism from the opening game of the season.The risk United are taking is enormous. Amorim is a fundamentalist. He will only play one way. 3-4-2-1 is the one true faith and there can be no deviation from that. United’s squad when he arrived was a hodgepodge accumulated over the reigns of six managers, with few common characteristics other than their mutual unfamiliarity with 3-4-2-1. Some will adapt, but many of the playing personnel will have to be replaced, a major overhaul to suit a manager who may by Sunday night have the worst win percentage at the club in almost a century.Burnley at home a week later offers a further opportunity for United to get points on the board, gain confidence and bolster faith in Amorim before the much more testing business of the Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium, straight after the international break.View image in fullscreenBryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha looked intermittently dangerous for Manchester United against Arsenal.Photograph: Matt McNulty/Getty ImagesPerhaps the £200m attacking combination of Benjamin Sesko, Cunha and Mbeumo can drive United forward. The absence of European football should help. But Sunday also demonstrated United’s many shortcomings.NeitherAltay Bayindir nor André Onanahave offered any suggestion they can be aconsistent high-level Premier League goalkeeper. United, more generally, have a major problem dealing with inswinging set-plays. If United can ever offload one of the many players they have made clear have no future at the club to create profitability and sustainability regulations headroom, and Gianluigi Donnarumma is available and interested for a knockdown price, he surely must be a priority.Leny Yoro has shown sufficient promise that it is possible to think he will be the first senior arrivalto get definitively better after joining Unitedsince Ashley Young and David De Gea signed in the same week in 2011. Cases could be made for Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot, but they have probably done little more than maintain their level – achievement enough in the Old Trafford permacrisis. Nonetheless, it is far from clear who Yoro’s most effective partners are. Matthijs de Ligt has never convinced since leaving Ajax. Lisandro Martínez has been unfortunate with injuries, as has Luke Shaw over a much longer period. Harry Maguire, his demeanour increasingly that of a put-upon husband from an 80s sitcom, is as much an emergency late-game striker these days as a central defender. Ayden Heaven is inexperienced.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Amorim seems convinced by the idea of Fernandes as one of the deep-lying players, but if that is to have a chance of working he needs an aggressive and industrious ball-winner alongside him. Casemiro no longer has the energy, while Manuel Ugarte, who played in a similar role for Sporting, has never come close to adapting to the pace and physicality of the Premier League, his loss of confidence reflected in some bizarre decision-making in the defeat against Arsenal.But the issue of Amorim’s dogmatism is not just that of the struggle to find players to fit. It is also of the sense of wastage, those players United have who have no obvious role in the 3-4-2-1. Is Amad, with his skittering feet and remarkable left foot, really best served operating as a right-wingback? And what of Kobbie Mainoo, prodigiously gifted, still only 20, a starter for England in the Euros final last summer, but not a natural fit for any role in Amorim’s system?How much faith do United have in Amorim? Enough to sideline Mainoo’s talents? Enough to carry on the overhaul of the squad to his specifications, even though that could take a further three or four windows? Enough to keep plodding through the wilderness, extolling every wisp of positivity in the belief the promised land will at some point be reached? Enough to survive defeat at Fulham?Explore more on these topicsRuben AmorimInside footballManchester UnitedcommentShareReuse this content"

Now there is one.Never before hadBrentfordplayed a competitive match here without Thomas Frank at the helm and there are bound to be doubts over his unlikely, inexperienced successor, Keith Andrews. This win over last year’s Champions League quarter-finalists deserves to allay a fair portion of them.The club-record signing, Dango Ouattara, provided the only goal on debut, but it was team-wide praise of “spirit”, “character” and “resilience” Andrews highlighted when expressing his pride in their performance.Arsenal v Leeds: Premier League – liveRead moreAny neutral might have identifiedAston Villaas the better footballing team for large periods after a notably slow start. The visitors dominated possession by a considerable margin (76% to 24%), and the game was overwhelmingly played to their tune. But time on the ball is worthless without finding a way to score.Their impotence high up the pitch is evident. Unai Emery has admitted there is “still work to do” in the final week of the transfer window and this defeat will only have strengthened his desperation to bolster his attacking ranks. How he will have wished he had any ofJacob Ramsey, Leon Bailey, Marcus Rashford or Marco Asensio to turn to off the bench. All four have left since the end of last season and no amount of huff or puff came even vaguely close to blowing Brentford’s resolute defence down.Having mustered three shots in their drabgoalless draw with Newcastle last Saturday, Villa did threaten more here, at least numerically, with 17 attempts – their most without scoring in a Premier League match since October 2022. That two were on target told a story.View image in fullscreenJordan Henderson dominated in midfield on his first start for Brentford.Photograph: Rob Newell/CameraSport/Getty Images“We have to perform with the players we have,” said Emery. “It’s enough players to get enough performances for this season. But this week is the last week for the transfer window. We have some circumstances that are not helping us. My message is keep calm, move on and work in the same way we are doing.”Brentford’s well-drilled performance was testament to a man still taking the first baby steps of his managerial career. Convention suggests Brentford could find themselves in a relegation scrap after losing their inspirational manager, captain and best player, while Yoane Wissa continues to be excluded on match days as he does all he can to force a move away.A pitiful defeat at Nottingham Forestadhered to that narrative, but four changes to the starting XI yielded significant improvement. If this is what Brentford will look like this season then they should be all right.Battling for everything on his first start, there is an unmistakable sense Jordan Henderson will be instrumental to all they do, hurrying, harrying and bellowing his way to midfield dominance. Add to that the hugely influential attacking duo of Mikkel Damsgaard, absent from the Forest defeat for the birth of his child, and debutant Ouattara. Both had the ball in the net in the opening half, albeit only one goal stood.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The returning Emi Martínez managed to keep out his first effort, but the ball ricocheted off Matty Cash and back into Ouattara’s path for him to slot home at the second attempt.Damsgaard was denied what would have been a wonderful goal just before half-time when his thunderous finish into the roof of the net from 15 yards was ruled out for a questionable foul on a flapping Martínez – under minimal pressure from Nathan Collins – in the buildup.Brentford naturally retreated deeper as the match wore on, but Kelleher was scarcely troubled. “The overriding emotion is pride,” said Andrews. “I spoke a bit before the game about the identity of our team. I felt we saw that in abundance.“Spirit and connection among all players. The togetherness of the group. It was filled with character and resilience. Those are things you need in this league.

Alejandro Balde was penalised for handball after a VAR review, and José Luis Morales converted the resulting penalty to leave the defending champions with a mountain to climb.Marcus Rashford, making his full debut for Barça afterjoining on loan from Manchester United, was substituted at half-time.

McTominay told Dazn: “It’s an honour to have De Bruyne in the team. I’m the one who has to learn from him, not the other way around.”Sassuolo’s Serie A return took another downturn when Ismaël Koné was shown a second yellow card just minutes from time.Antonio Conte praised Napoli’s spirit but admitted he is still searching for the right balance in midfield. The manager said: “I am still trying to find the right formula to ensure the three midfielders from last season can co-exist harmoniously with Kevin.

In the 13th minute of a goalless first half against Livi, the ultras-style fans group Green Brigade launched into the first of several “sack the board” chants and held up banners which read “zero ambition”, “neglect team”, “rinse fans” and “basic board”, albeit there seemed little vocal backing from the rest of the ground.View image in fullscreenCeltic fans hold up banners in the stands showing their dissatisfaction with the club’s board.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PARodgers, who is hoping to add to his squad in the coming days, is confident Kairat will see a better version of Celtic at the second time of asking. “I don’t think there’s any doubt about that,” said Rodgers, who is “not sure” if defender Auston Trusty (foot) will make the trip to Kairat and “will wait and see” if striker Adam Idah (knee) will be involved.“I’ve had games, like I said before, that went for us. And some that haven’t. But it’s winner takes all now. And everything is there for us to do it.“They’re a good side, well organised, and it’s always tough in European football to go away. But we know we need the result. And we’re going to give absolutely everything to get the result and be at the top table of European football.”Rodgers was comfortable making so many changes, with a debut for the 23-year-old Japanese left-back Hayato Inamura, while the 18-year-old Colby Donovan came on for Anthony Ralston to make his debut in the 79th minute.He said: “I don’t tend to [see it as a risk]. I think that if you are at Celtic you’ve got to be good enough to play, especially at home and when you want to dominate the game. So I was pleased for those guys that came in.“Young Inamura, he can play in games with dominance when you have 75-80 per cent and can conserve it. So he did well. I thought Dane Murray was excellent until he tired in the last 15 minutes. But I thought he was excellent, him and [Liam] Scales, he steadied it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s got the hunger, he’s a good size, serves the ball well, you see straight away when he comes in, he’s not timid, he’s aggressive. It’s about balancing up whether he goes out on loan or whether they keep him here and give him some minutes. That’s what we’ll decide.“But I really like him and I think longer-term he’s going to be a fantastic player for the squad here.”Asked about reports claiming there was a Celtic delegation in Belgium to close a deal for the Royal Antwerp forward Michel-Ange Balikwisha, Rodgers said: “Well, I think the delegation were all at this game. I don’t know who else would talk contract talks.“But there’s a number of players that we’ve been at for a number of months. So we’ll see over the next 48 hours what that looks like.”TheLivingstonmanager, David Martindale, acknowledged the strength in depth at Celtic.He said: “You are at Celtic for a reason. You look at Anthony Ralston. He been playing with Scotland and he’s going to be playing Champions League football next week, playing Champions League football most years. I think it’s quite easy to say that they’ve made a lot of changes, but the changes are still really, really strong and if you could have taken three players out of the starting line-up, they’d probably have been Daizen Maeda, James Forrest, Callum McGregor.“And then I turned around, I can’t remember if it was 1-0 or 2-0, and I see all three warming up to come on. So it’s a big club, elite-level football and I think anyone who steps on that path for Celtic is more than capable of playing for Celtic.”Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipCelticLivingstonBrendan Rodgersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The team may benefit from flying under the radar with less pressure on their shoulders but it does not make them any less a contender for the trophy. The clinical nature of their opener against Fiji announced their arrival in England in style, particularly through the full-back Julia Schell who was spectacular in the second half as she scored six tries in 21 minutes.Francesca McGhie bags hat-trick as Scotland demolish Wales at Women’s Rugby World CupRead moreSchell’s performance may have inspired girls to pick up a rugby ball but she is used to trying to make change. She grew up playing ice hockey and petitioned at elementary school for women to be able to do open-ice hitting as it was banned. “My petition said ‘girls should be able to hit’ but it was fitting how I ended up in rugby where it is the same for men and women,” Schell said post-match. “To score six tries feels good. I was joking with the fans, one said just before the first one ‘200 bucks for a try’ so I have to find him!”The fact Canada are being overlooked by many does not correlate to recent results, with wins against Australia and the USA and a draw against the Black Ferns at Pacific Four. They are also ranked as the No 2 side in the world so the 11-try result was not surprising in the hugely physical battle between the two nations which also saw replacement Fiji prop Bulou Vasuturaga shown a red card for a high tackle after a bunker review.Quick GuideFrance see off Italy in Women's Rugby World CupShowFrance grind down Italy in Pool DFrance scored three tries to beat Italy 24-0 in their Women's Rugby World Cup opener in Exeter.After a tight start between the two Pool D teams, Joanna Grisez broke the deadlock in the 27th minute to cross, squeezing through a gap in the Italian defence before grounding and Morgane Bourgeois converted.France almost had a second following a scrappy defensive effort from Italy, but their effort was ruled out after the ball was deemed to have been simultaneously grounded by both Alyssa D'Inca and Bourgeois.The French full-back shortly extended their lead from the tee just before the break and Assia Khalfaoui eventually bagged the second five minutes into the second-half, with Bourgeois converting.France were then forced to work for their third try, going through 20 phases before Charlotte Escudero, pictured, went over and Bourgeois added the extras.PA MediaPhotograph: Glyn Kirk/AFPWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Fiji, who are led by the former Wales coach Ioan Cunningham, fronted up in defence but the women in red were the first to score through Sophie De Goede and then Gillian Boag. Just as momentum was swinging firmly in the Canadians’ direction they were hit with a yellow card, which was referred to the bunker but remained a yellow, after the fly-half Taylor Perry made a high tackle.View image in fullscreenJulia Schell scores another try as Fiji struggle to contain the wing.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesCanada only increased their lead though with a try from Caroline Crossley and they added another once back to 15 through Alysha Corrigan. Fiji finished the half strongly but were unable to execute promising attacks, with their brightest sparks Mereoni Nakesa and captain Alfreda Fisher.The best try of the match opened the second half and it was free-flowing Fijian fluency which rendered the biggest cheer of the afternoon when replacement winger Kolora Lomani went over. Canada responded perfectly with Schell’s six tries and they came after the Canada head coach, Kévin Rouet, had a word with her. “I said to her at half-time: ‘Julia, you need to win your one-v-ones’ and she was like: ‘I am going to prove you wrong’ and she did.”Fiji’s afternoon got worse with Vasuturaga’s trip to the sin-bin upgraded to a red card and Karen Paquin rounded off the scoring in a dominant outing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This time round they turned it into an aerial contest, marshalled superbly by Pollard, who kicked 15 points to go with tries by the wing Canan Moodie, the No 8 Kwagga Smith and the lock Eben Etzebeth.South Africa 30-22 Australia: 2025 Rugby Championship Test – liveRead moreAustralia were in the fight all the way and put in another excellent display as they scored three tries through wings Corey Toole and Max Jorgensen and the hooker, Brandon Paenga-Amosa, but a good old-fashioned arm-wrestle is the Springboks’ forte.“It was greasy out there, but we played well,” Pollard said. “Our defence was good at times, though we also gave away some silly penalties.“We have wings who are unbelievable in the air and it is something the boys put a lot of effort into. We know there is a bigger plan with our squad and we trust the process. Our forwards also stepped up in those last 10 minutes to win us some penalties.”View image in fullscreenKwagga Smith scores a try for the Springboks as they recovered from last week’s surprise loss to the Wallabies.Photograph: Gallo Images/Getty ImagesAustralia may rue the bounce of the ball that did not go their way at times, but it was another performance full of character and fight. Fraser McReight, captaining the side in the absence through injury of Harry Wilson, said: “It was a great physical battle out there and I am super proud of my boys. We fought right to the end.“It has been a tough two weeks over here. There were a few moments where if we got the ball back our way, the result could have been different. But that is the beauty of rugby.”Australia lost their full-back, Tom Wright, and scrum-half, Nic White, to injury in the first 13 minutes, and the centre Joseph Suaalii at half-time, but their bench again came up trumps again to keep them within touching distance of the Springboks.A try for Toole on debut briefly had Australia in front early on, but South Africa led 20-10 at the break despite the visitors seeing plenty of possession. Australia had the chance to take the lead with 12 minutes remaining but James O’Connor missed a relatively simple conversion.With the game in the balance, Etzebeth’s stretch close to the line extended South Africa’s lead to eight points and they held on for what was a much-needed victory after their second-half capitulation in Johannesburg.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It does give belief,” he said. “This time last year the Springboks put two bonus point victories on us at a canter.”He added: “I felt like we made more line breaks and created more dangerous attacks.

Just when Tommy Fleetwood looked to have a firm grip on this Tour Championship, Cantlay emerged from the shadows in a bid to become the third member of the US Ryder Cup contingent in the course of this season to deny Fleetwood the win he is long overdue on American soil. It feels poetic that Cantlay was front and centre as Fleetwood and Europe triumphed over the US in Rome two years ago. If it is to be Tommy’s time, he will have to scrap for it. Cantlay might be in his home country but so many of the Atlanta gallery will root for the hugely popular Fleetwood on day four.Cantlay birdied four of his last five holes at East Lake to produce a back nine of 31 in an overall 64. Cantlay’s 16 under par topped Fleetwood until the Southport golfer rolled in a birdie putt from 10ft at the 17th. Fleetwood’s 67 meant he is tied at the leaderboard summit with Cantlay, 18 holes from home.Keegan Bradley agonising over whether to be a playing Ryder Cup captain for USRead moreFleetwood rattled off four birdies in succession from the 5th to endorse the sense this is finally his American time. East Lake jabbed back at the 15th, where Fleetwood found water from the tee before slipping to a double bogey five. Fleetwood’s response was excellent, courtesy of shots collected at the 16th and 17th before his fairway wood to the last drifted into a greenside bunker. Sixteen under plays 16 under. There is a two-shot gap to Russell Henley in third.“You want to be in the final group on Sunday or you want to be in contention,” said Fleetwood. “I love the fact that I’m playing so well. I love the fact that I’m getting rewarded for my work by being in this position because we all grind so hard, we all practise so hard, but it’s been so long where you don’t get out of it what you put in.Golfjust isn’t like that.“I love that I’m up there again, and it’s just another chance.

Bradley’s upcoming Ryder Cup decision is getting harder by the day. The US captain, who must choose whether or not he also wants to play at Bethpage, posted a 63 to leap to 13 under. Strange though it may seem for a qualifying process which lasts two years, Bradley’s final day performance feels hugely significant. Should he win or even come close to claiming the Tour Championship, he is surely set to become the first playing captain in the Ryder Cup since Arnold Palmer in 1963.“I caught myself on the range today thinking about something I wanted to tell the team at Bethpage and it happens to me throughout the round,” Bradley explained. “I see a guy at the leaderboard and I remember who we’re thinking of pairing him with and it’s great that they’re playing good, or I wish they were a little higher, whatever it is. It’s been a wild year. I’m just trying to tackle what’s in front of me, and I think I’ve done a good job of that. This might be my best round of the year, which I’m really proud of.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her life has been on fast-forward for the last few hectic yet rewarding weeks, emerging from the heat and humidity of the Cincinnati Open with another significant title. Fourteen hours later she was on court in New York, throwing herself into two long days of competition alongside her new partner, Casper Ruud. The stakes were low for singles players in the mixed doubles this week but every point she played meant more mental energy expended.‘I’m so driven to find a way’: Holger Rune on what it takes to beat Alcaraz and SinnerRead moreThere is still little time for Swiatek to reflect on how the summer has developed, but with the final grand slam tournament of the year starting on Sunday it is clear the past few months have become a defining moment in her career. Swiatek started the season swimming upstream, still reeling from her doping case last year. She emerged from that difficult period with the most surprising, special victory of her career, a triumph on grass, her least favourite surface, at Wimbledon, which she sealed witha merciless 6-0, 6-0 demolitionof Amanda Anisimova in the final. In stark contrast to the relief she felt after previous triumphs, this victory brought her only joy.That emotion has endured throughout Swiatek’s hard-court season, and as a result the Pole will begin the US Open as the favourite, seeking her seventh grand slam title. The competition, however, is varied and difficult.Aryna Sabalenkarightfully remains the world No 1, although she has repeatedly frozen in the most significant moments, despite how frequently she has put herself in position to win big titles. After two major finals and a semi-final this year, the Belarusian’s US Open title defence represents her last opportunity to end a year of near misses with a massive victory.Sabalenka’s challenges, however, pale in comparison with Coco Gauff’s struggles. It was reasonable to assume the American’s triumph at the French Open, where she established herself as a multiple slam champion, would have inspired more freedom and confidence in her game. Instead, her serve has completely deteriorated over the past few months. On the eve of the US Open, she took the decision to part ways with one of her coaches, Matthew Daly, and hire Gavin MacMillan, the biomechanics expert who helped to revive Sabalenka’s serve. It was a drastic move.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have pulled away from the rest of the men’s field and are favourites to face each other in a third successive grand slam final.Photograph: Frey/TPN/Getty ImagesAs is always the case, a wide variety of characters can compete for the title, depending on how they are feeling in New York. Although Mirra Andreeva’s form has cooled over the past few months, the Russian has the talent to break through at any time. Madison Keys, the victor in Australia, and Anisimova had spectacular grand slam runs this year and can do so again on home soil.Elena Rybakina appears to be on the verge of rediscovering her top form. Perhaps the Canadian Open will turn out to be a sign of things to come, with the 18-year-old Victoria Mboko putting togethera spectacular breakout title winand Naomi Osaka showing promising signs by reaching the final.In contrast to the notable shifts in women’s tennis this year, absolutely nothing has changed at the top of the men’s game. Just as in Paris, Wimbledon and the Masters 1000 events since, the question remains whether any challenger is prepared to take down just one of Jannik Sinner andCarlos Alcaraz. As the gap between them and the rest of the field continues to grow, they will start the US Open attempting to contest a third consecutive grand slam final and a fifth final this year overall.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic has three made grand slam semi-finals this year but questions whether he still has the physicality to win one of the majors at 38.Photograph: Sarah Stier/Getty ImagesNovak Djokovic, now 38, has been the third-best player at the grand slam tournaments with three semi-finals. However, he has not competed since Wimbledon. After hisstraight-sets defeat by Sinnerthere in early July, Djokovic himself cast doubt on his ability to win his 25th grand slam title due to the physicality of these events across the best of five sets, which are increasingly difficult to navigate due to his ageing body.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He followed up his quarter-final run at Wimbledon by emerging from a bruising two weeks in Toronto with his first Masters 1000 title. Already a two‑time grand slam semi‑finalist, the 22-year-old American produces his best tennis at the major tournaments and in front of home crowds. The coming weeks are a chance for him to consolidate his status as a top contender.In the spring it was Jack Draper who seemed to have positioned himself as the younger player most likely to challenge Sinner and Alcaraz, but the Briton’s last few months have been complicated. After frustrating defeats at the French Open and Wimbledon, a left forearm injury forced Draper off the tour for three months and he has not competed in singles since losing in SW19. A year after his first big grand slam breakthrough,a rousing semi-final run, he returns to the US Open without any hard‑court preparation.Time is not on Draper’s side this week, but the qualities that have put him in this position as the fifth-best player in the world at a grand slam – his ability and ambition – mean he is more than capable of quickly finding his feet and taking another significant step forward.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025TennisUS Open tennisUS sportsIga SwiatekAryna SabalenkaCoco GaufffeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the talks show the enthusiasm with which the technology secretary has embraced the artificial intelligence sector, despite concerns over the accuracy of some chatbot responses andimplications for privacy and copyright.OpenAI offers free and subscription versions ofChatGPT. The paid version, ChatGPT Plus, costs $20 a month and gives users faster response times and priority access to new features.Kyle dined with Altman in March and April, according to transparency data released by the UK government. In July, Kyle signed an agreement with OpenAI to use AI in the UK’s public services. The non-binding deal could give OpenAI access to government data and lead to its software being used in education, defence, security and the justice system.View image in fullscreenSecretary of state for science, innovation and technology Peter Kyle.Photograph: Thomas Krych/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockKyle has been a vocal champion of AI within government and has also embraced its use in his own role. In March, it emerged that he hadasked ChatGPT for adviceon a range of work-related questions, including why British businesses were not adopting AI and what podcasts he should appear on.The minister told PoliticsHome in January: “ChatGPT is fantastically good, and where there are things that you really struggle to understand in depth, ChatGPT can be a very good tutor for it.”The UK is one of OpenAI’s top five markets for paid ChatGPT subscriptions. An OpenAI spokesperson said: “Millions of Brits are already using ChatGPT every day for free. In July, we signed an MoU [a memorandum of understanding] with the government to explore how we can best support the growth of AI in the UK, for the UK.“In line with the government’s vision of using this technology to unlock economic opportunity for everyday people, our shared goal is to democratise access to AI. The more people who can use it, the more widely its benefits will spread.”The company has been in talks with several governments in recent months and has agreed a deal with the United Arab Emirates to “enable ChatGPT nationwide” and use the technology in public sectors including transport, healthcare and education.The UK government has been keen to attract AI investment from the US,having struck dealswith OpenAI’s rivals Google and Anthropic earlier this year.Kyle has said that if a new UN security council were to be set up in a decade, technological clout – particularly in AI – would be a major factor in determining the most powerful countries. He told the Rest is Politics podcast in the spring: “I want us to be at the very forefront of [AI] because those countries will get to shape how it goes, how it is used and deployed.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It does this by drawing on existing books, photos, footage and songs.

We are working with OpenAI and other leading AI companies to explore investment in UK infrastructure, improve public services and rigorously test the security of new technology before it is made public.”The science and technology department said it had not taken forward any proposal to give UK residents access to ChatGPT Plus or discussed it with other departments.Explore more on these topicsPeter KyleChatGPTOpenAISam AltmannewsShareReuse this content"

So why does he still think social media is a force for good?Read an exclusive extract from Nick Clegg’s new book hereSat 23 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 23 Aug 2025 04.50 EDTShareThe rain is just starting to fall from a grey London sky as SirNick Cleggarrives, ducking through the traffic and carrying what looks like his laundry. Clean shirts for the photoshoot, he says, before apologetically wondering if he might possibly get a coffee. Within minutes he has further apologised for wanting to swap the leather club chair he is offered for a hard plastic one; and then, in horror, for any impression inadvertently given that my questions might send him to sleep.Impeccable English manners should never be mistaken for diffidence – at 58, Clegg remains the only British political figure who could convincingly be played by the equally posh but self-effacing Colin Firth, whose old London home Clegg recently bought – but there are backbench nobodies more grandly self-important than the former deputy prime minister who became number two at the tech giant Meta. Which may be just as well, given rumours that his next supporting role may be to his lawyer wife Miriam González Durántez’s nascent political career in Spain. It turns out she “never really settled” in the land of the billionaire tech bro, one of many reasons the couple swapped poolside life in Palo Alto, California, for London almost three years before he left Meta, which owns and operates Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. “She’s fomenting insurrection in Spain now,” Clegg says ofEspaña Mejor, her non-profit aimed at bringing citizens into policymaking.It’s almost as if the marital tables have turned. “Yeah, well, she’d be a much better politician than I,” he laughs. A week later, rumours surface that González Durántez might consider leading a new Spanish liberal party.If Clegg ever needed to fade gracefully into his wife’s political shadow, as Bill Clinton did for Hillary, I suspect he’d be comfortable with that. He has done 15 tough years on the frontline: first as the Liberal Democrat leader in a Conservative-led coalition government, often defending or apologising for the compromises that accompany power; followed by something not dissimilar but better paid as president of global affairs atMeta.Are reports that he earned £100m in salary and stock options over seven years inSilicon Valleytrue? “I’m sure they’re wrong, but I haven’t put the … ” He wriggles. “I was paid extremely well. I feel extremely fortunate.”Nick Clegg has sold almost $19m in Meta shares since joining Facebook in 2018Read moreEither way, perhaps what his critics most want to know is whether he really was committed to the cause, or sold out to big tech for the money. “I’m afraid the truth is worse than they imagine,” he says genially. “I really do believe that, despite its imperfections, social media has allowed billions of people – especially billions of people who often cultural elites like us in the developed world don’t think about, across Africa, Latin America, Asia – to communicate with each other in a way that has never happened before.”So this great human experiment in bringing a billion people into each other’s homes was worth it? “Anything that empowers people to express themselves, I have a very visceral liberal view that is a good thing. And all the evidence I’ve come across suggests the net effect is very positive.” It’s what comes next that concerns him. His new book, How to Save the Internet, warns of the dangers posed to a free and open global internet by an age of autocrats and a titanic power struggle over AI.Clegg announced his departure from Meta just weeks before all the tech titans – Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, his own former boss Mark Zuckerberg – werephotographed lining up obediently at Donald Trump’s inauguration. The timing was no coincidence: Clegg expected Trump to win, but hadn’t foreseen “quite the alacrity with which the whole of Silicon Valley was going to move from what it was when I moved there, which was wary of politics, to seeking to be joined at the hip with the new administration”. Having long argued for Meta to stay out of politics, evidently that was Clegg’s red line.Still, he insists his exit was “very civilised”. He won’t criticise the measures announced days after he left – including replacing professional factcheckers on Facebook andInstagramwith a Wikipedia-style system of users correcting misinformation, plus loosening the constraints around posting on hot topics such as immigration or gender – to reduce what Zuckerberg called “censorship mistakes”. A course correction, Clegg insists, was not illogical. “I think it was reasonable to say, particularly around the time of the pandemic, that we slightly overdid it. Most of the time I was there, the pressure from government and, dare I say it, from papers like the Guardian, was always ‘take down’.”In Silicon Valley, everyone wears the same clothes, drives the same cars, listens to the same podcasts. It’s herd-like behaviourBut did he agree with Zuckerberg telling the manosphere-friendly Joe Rogan podcast the same week that corporate life needed more “masculine energy”, and a culture that “celebrates the aggression a bit more”? There is a pause. “It’s not really me,” he says flatly. “I don’t really know what to say about that.” Well, he could just say what he thinks?“When I think about all the problems of society, I don’t think the one thing we need is more masculinity,” he begins slowly, then suddenly he’s off, at an increasingly indignant gallop. “You’d think, wouldn’t you, that if you were immensely powerful and rich like Elon Musk and all these other tech bros and members of that podcast community, that you’d reflect on your good fortune compared with most other people?But here’s the interesting thing.” His tone grows more scathing.“In Silicon Valley, far from thinking they’re lucky, they think they’re hard done by, they’re victims. I couldn’t, and still can’t, understand this deeply unattractive combination of machismo and self-pity.”He insists he’s not directing any of this against Zuckerberg personally. “And please don’t portray it as such – it is aculturalthing, from Elon Musk’s chainsaw-wielding stuff to any Silicon Valley podcast. If you’re accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.”It’s not the first time the concept of recognising your own privilege enters our conversation – Clegg jokes that returning to London helped avoid the youngest of their three sons, 16-year-old Miguel, growing up “a spoilt Silicon Valley brat” – but it seems the most heartfelt, for reasons perhaps rooted in his own childhood.Nick Clegg was born in Buckinghamshire, the third of four children of a half-English, half-Russian banker father and a Dutch mother who as a child survived internment and near-starvation in a brutal Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. Those early experiences left their mark: Clegg and his three siblings, though privately educated, were raised not to take their gilded lives for granted and never to waste food.Of the three bubbles in which he admits to spending his working life – Brussels as an MEP, then Westminster as an MP and finally Silicon Valley – Clegg found Westminster “the most insufferable, partly just because of the living on past glories and the pomposity of it”.Charismatic and smart, he was tipped for the leadership before he even arrived in parliament in 2005. But even he seemed faintly disconcerted byCleggmania, that feverish period in 2010 when voters unconvinced by Gordon Brown or David Cameron decided that they, too – in what became the catchphrase of the first-ever televised election debate –agreed with Nick.In hindsight, Cleggmania foreshadowed a much angrier strain of populist revolt against the mainstream to come.But it could not survive him joining Cameron in coalition. The Lib Dems won battles – over free school lunches and tax cuts for the low-paid – but never recovered from having to defend benefit cuts and renege on their pledge to scrap tuition fees. After their crushing defeat in the 2015 election, Clegg could only watch from opposition as Cameron called and lost a Brexit referendum that still enrages him. (Whenever his former partner is mentioned, he noticeably stiffens: when I say I’d heard Cameron envied his fancy job and fresh start in California, his only response is a clipped, “I can’t comment on how other people feel.”) He is convinced Britain will rejoin the EU within his lifetime, and if he ever saw that debate resuming, “I’d drop everything – whether to stuff envelopes or man the barricades.”In 2017, Clegg lost his seat to an underwhelming Labour candidate later jailed for fraud. But it wasn’t the worst thing to happen that year; in the autumn the couple disclosed that their then15-year-old eldest son Antonio had undergone treatment for cancer. (Now thankfully recovered, Antonio and his younger brother Alberto have stayed in the US for university and work.) Coincidentally, that summer the family had holidayed in California to celebrate the end of Antonio’s chemotherapy, which meant when the then Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg approached Clegg about a job in 2018, “we could say to the boys, ‘Do you want to go back and live in the place we’ve just holidayed in?’”View image in fullscreenWith the then British prime minster David Cameron en route to a coalition cabinet meeting in January 2012 …Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreen… and with his wife, Miriam González Durántez, at the Liberal Democrat autumn conference in October 2014.Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty ImagesThe idea of starting over in sunny, can-do California clearly beat “trying to relitigate the battles of the past” back home. Yet it meant leaping from the frying pan into the fire of a company accused ofswinging the 2016 election for Trump, ruining teenagers’ mental health and failing to stop its platform in Myanmar being used tohelp incite violence against the Rohingya minority, in which thousands died and more than 700,000 fled.Clegg insists he wouldn’t have joined the company if he wasn’t convincedFacebookwanted to change. But, crucially,he also has the unwavering commitment to free speech – even if what is said is offensive – of a liberal raised in pre-internet times. He fought pitched battles in government with then home secretary Theresa May over online state snooping, and is uncomfortable now to read of British police making 30 arrests a day for allegedly offensive social media posts.It clearly rankles that the case for free speech is argued loudest now not by liberals but by Reform leader Nigel Farage – who recently criticised the introduction of age verification on social media sites, meant to stop children seeing legal but harmful content such as pornography – and US vice-president JD Vance. “There is nothing I find more stomach-churning than the brazen hypocrisy of Trump administration members flying first-class over to Europe and pontificating about being the great defenders of free expression, when they then fly back to intimidate and bully their opponents,” Clegg says. It’s in the US, not Europe, he notes, that foreign students cleanse their social media feeds to avoid deportation. Yet he warns that if crackdowns on so-called online harms – odious but not illegal material – become all-encompassing, they will be politically exploited. “The Farages of this world will get more of a hearing the more imprecise these boundaries are.”Why I have finally quit Facebook (it’s not just about fact-checking) | Zoe WilliamsRead moreDespite his libertarian instincts, Silicon Valley was a culture shock.In an industry obsessed with Chinese rivals, Europe barely figured (the only British issue people asked about was Harry and Meghan, a subject he views with “shoulder-shrugging indifference”). And though his book is in parts very funny – Musk beaming into an AI summit via video link from his private jet like “a hostage video shot on the Death Star”; then culture secretary Nadine Dorries demanding he take down a controversial tweet, seemingly unaware Meta doesn’t own Twitter (now X) – Clegg soon learned not to make jokes at work, after one ice-breaker about not bringing your “authentic self” to the office elicited stony silence.Though he loved exploring the great outdoors with his sons, he found Silicon Valley “cloyingly conformist”, despite its claims to radical disruption. “Everyone wears the same clothes, drives the same cars, listens to the same podcasts, follows the same fads. It’s a place born of immense sort of herd-like behaviour.”Yet even as an outsider, Clegg still sees tech as a force for good. His book was conceived as a plea to preserve the open flow of information and money across borders, in a time of drawbridges being yanked up. But it also confronts claims that social media has made us angrier, dumber and sadder, chiefly by arguing, in true centrist dad style, that it’s actually more complicated than that. “You don’t just switch your phone on, scroll, then suddenly something happens to your neural pathways to make you think and feel things you never did before.”I wish Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves took   bigger swings. What they’ll learn, which I learned, is you only have one crack at itThe evidence linking social media use with children’s mental health is weaker than often suggested, he argues, with some troubled teenagers finding comfort online; but he acknowledges it’s not always the case for vulnerable people. In 2021 awhistleblower leaked internal Instagram researchsuggesting a worrying number of girls already struggling with issues such as body image reported that using social media made the difficult times worse.Clegg doesn’t disagree with calls for new age limits on children’s social media use. “I cannot think of a better decision that should be taken by parliaments, not by tech bros.” He thinks 13- to 16-year-olds should have separate social media, with age restrictions enforced via app stores when children first set up their phones.Similarly he argues in the book that affective polarisation – hostility to people with different political views – started rising in the US before mass use of social media, and even fell in some countries as social media use increased. Does he think the sway it holds over politics now is more or less unhealthy than that wielded by old media kingpins such as Rupert Murdoch and Paul Dacre? “I think it’s way more unhealthy in the hands of people like Dacre because he’s famous for just kneecapping people he doesn’t like for political ends. No tech bro is going to do that, because the people who run the platforms, they don’t generate the content.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But is he really claiming social media has nothing to do with the rise of Trump, Reform or violent flashpoints such as last year’s Southport riots (partly fuelled by posts wrongly describing the killer as an illegal immigrant)?He does concede that virality is new and can, as seen in Myanmar, “create new perils. Does it mean the anger of the mob is invented by social media? Of course not. Pol Pot, the 1930s, the pogroms – all of these things happened well before social media.”But if, as he argues, it wasn’t social media, then what did leave Britain so “knackered and sullen and out of puff”? Clegg blames the “near-death experience” of the 2008 banking crash, followed by what some would call his government’s crippling austerity measures, then Brexit and a “chronic wasted decade” of political paralysis. “I remember so vividly in 2015 thinking, oh, finally. People’s earnings started rising above prices in 2015 after years of this bone-crushing pressure on wages. And it literally flipped overnight in 2016.”The one time he seems genuinely flustered is when asked aboutCareless People, a memoir by ex-Meta executiveSarah Wynn-Williams– who left the year before he joined – painting a picture of toxic tech bros out of control. Meta, which initially sought an injunction preventing the author promoting it, insists the book contains “defamatory and untrue allegations”.Wynn-Williams claims she was asked by Sandberg to join her in bed on board the corporate private jet.Did Clegg witness anything like that? “No. I haven’t read it for very good reasons. You’ll have to ask her why she wrote it eight years after she left, I’m writing mine eight months after announcing leaving Meta.”But you needn’t have read it to answer the question? “They’re instances in time when I wasn’t there. I didn’t see any of that.”Wynn-Williams also accuses her boss, Joel Kaplan – later Clegg’s deputy, now his successor – of sexually harassing her. (Meta calls this “misleading and unfounded”, saying an internal investigation cleared Kaplan, and Wynn-Williams was fired for “poor performance and toxic behaviour”.)“I don’t know anything about those subjects,” Clegg says. “Joel Kaplan was always an exceptionally decent, diligent, principled guy who worked with me, so I can’t give you a running commentary on a book I haven’t read about a person I don’t know at a time when I wasn’t even at the company.” Now he’s getting agitated: “If people want, ‘Oh, he’s left Facebook, he’s now going to condemn them’ – of course I’m not, that’s not what my book is about. It’s not how I feel, and even if that’s how I felt, I wouldn’t then write that book.View image in fullscreenWith Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg in 2018.Photograph: via Sheryl Sandberg/Facebook“If I felt Mark Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg were the monsters other people say they are, I don’t think I would ever have worked there … Are there things where I very strongly disagree with them? Are there mistakes they’ve made? You bet there are, many of which they’ve acknowledged. But, you know, at the end of the day I arrived at that company convinced these were two people who recognised it needed to change dramatically and took me on to deliver the change.”The reforms he fought for included creating an independent oversight board to adjudicate big decisions, such as whether to suspend high-profile users, and commissioning independent research tracking the impact of various measures – banning political ads, or switching feeds to chronological rather than algorithmic order – on control groups of users during the 2020 election. “The wildly underwhelming conclusion was it makes almost no difference at all to how people actually vote.”‘People said it did in his career’: 33 pictures that defined British politiciansRead moreHe also introduced new parental controls, including the ability to limit children’s time on Instagram – though the Cleggs didn’t ration their own boys’ screen time. “We’ve always just talked to them a lot about what they are seeing – I’ll find out in 20 years if it’s done any good. Thankfully I have football-obsessed boys, so they spend all their time looking at clips of the latest Messi goal.”When I ask about his toughest day at Meta, I’m half expecting something like thesuicide of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who had been viewing self-harm images on Instagram (the coroner ruled she died “while suffering from depression and the negative effects of online content”). But, instead, he picks the “very, very uncomfortable” decision he took tosuspend Trump from Facebook in 2021for incendiary posts during the Capitol Hill riots. “I found that really weighed on me very heavily and still does because, on the one hand, I felt very clearly that the content rules of the company had been violated and, on the other hand … it’s an unelected private company making a decision that affects the public realm. And he was the outgoing president of the world’s most powerful democracy.”He would still defend the decision, but the precedent set troubles him. “In the end, in a democracy you want democratically accountable figures to thrash it out.”Having seen America’s descent into rightwing populism, does he think Britain can avoid that fate? Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are “decent people”, he suggests, but maddeningly cautious. “I just wish they took bigger swings. It’s all these endless half measures – a little reform here, a little step towards Europe there, a little placation towards Trump. What they’ll learn, which I learned, is you only have one crack at it.” For all the coalition’s flaws, he says, it was bold. “I remember sitting around a table with Cameron and [George] Osborne saying, ‘Look, this is coalition government, it’s probably not going to last, let’s justgofor it.’”Labour should, he argues, be pinning the failures of Brexit on Farage. “His one biggest achievement was a disaster. It’s made us poorer, weaker, less relevant, more anxious, more inward-looking.” Nor does he think they can remain close to both Trump and the EU. “At the end of the day, we as an island will have to decide. There will be a choice between Europe and America,” he says exasperatedly, citing Vance’s support for the far-right AfD during elections in Germany. “This was American political interference in domestic election contests in Europe, way more overt than anything the Russians ever did.” He was horrified byVance’s now-infamous Munich speech, which argued the real threat to Europe was from unchecked migration and exclusion of the far right. “It’s hiding in plain sight, you have to choose.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Vintiner/The Guardian. Grooming: Alice Theobald at Arlington Artists using Rhug Wild Beauty and Charlotte TilburyIn January, he made his choice. But Silicon Valley chose very differently. Why did the once-liberal scions of tech fall inso fast behind Trump? It wasn’t just in hopes of avoiding tougher regulation, Clegg argues: he thinks the shared determination to win an arms race with China over AI created an unhealthy alliance between American tech, military and political elites, exemplified in Musk’s quasi-government role as chainsaw wielder-in-chief. For democracy’s sake, he was relieved when the president won a recent standoff with the unelected Musk over planned tax cuts. “Anyone who cares about making sure these tech bros are held in check and the people we elect are in charge – whatever else one might think about him, it was important that the political won.”Having worked at the top of both fields, Clegg rejects the idea that tech companies are more powerful than governments. “They don’t determine the curriculum of your child’s history lessons, or whether you send people into war, or raise or lower people’s taxes.” Yet he recounts a conversation with the then British chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who pointed out that Meta could afford to do things the entire British state could not, like ploughing “70 billion quid” a year into building AI infrastructure. And therein lies the book’s warning.Five years from now, Clegg predicts, “agentic” AI – bots who will navigate tasks online for us – will be routinely embedded in our phones, or perhaps in wearables such as glasses. They’ll do everything for us from “me being reminded of my mum’s birthday, to booking a holiday, to recommending songs you like”.Much of the content we’ll see will be AI-generated by platform owners, who’ll build and own the underlying infrastructure on which this AI-powered future depends. AI could be empowering, he argues, liberating humans from tiresome admin. But the more we rely on it just to live our daily lives, the more power and wealth could accrue to the handful of companies controlling it. “When power gets concentrated in so few hands for such extensive social impact – way bigger than social media … ” Clegg pauses. “I don’t think these companies will continue to have social permission to operate.” Is he saying these are conditions for social unrest? “Yes.”He suspects AI will eat human jobs more slowly than forecast, “at a pace we will be able to socially adapt to” if we’re lucky. “Having said that, I think there are potentially the ingredients for pitchfork fury at this small elite of people accruing vast, vast wealth, while there is a great deal of turbulence and adjustment and pain”. If big tech push their luck, he argues, they risk being nationalised.Will people like his old boss listen? “I think these companies will realise, if they’re smart, they’re not going to be able to lord it over society like some sci-fi movie.”His own next step, he says, is trying to prevent the European tech industry getting sidelined, as he fears it is “hurtling towards museum status. The situation is so much worse than people appreciate.” American GDP has rocketed away from Europe’s in the last decade, he points out, creating a painfully obvious disparity in lifestyles. “Look at the Cotswolds, it’s become a sort of Disney for rich Americans.” But, mostly, he wants to keep making the case for the future, rather than for retreating into the past. “If you fear everything new, you will do nothing for fear that something might go wrong,” he says passionately. “The whole point of being progressive is to think that tomorrow will be better than today, that you’re excited about the possibilities of the future.” Though in politics, at least, that future no longer belongs to him.How to Save the Internet by Nick Clegg (Vintage Publishing, £25).

But Fussey said: “The claims the Met are making about the absence of bias from the NPL report are not substantiated by the facts in that report.”For LFR to work, the sensitivity of the system can be varied. The more sensitive it is the more people it will detect, but the higher its potential bias will be on racial, gender and age grounds. Zero is its most sensitive setting and one the least sensitive.The NPL report found there was bias at a setting of 0.56. At a setting of 0.6 it found seven cases where people in its test were wrongly flagged as wanted – a false positive. All were from ethnic minorities.The study results were gained after 178,000 images were entered into the system. Four hundred volunteers walked past cameras approximately 10 times each, providing 4,000 chances for the system to correctly recognise them. They were contained in what the study estimated were crowds of more than 130,000 people at four sites inLondonand one in Cardiff. Testing took place in sunny conditions and totalled 34.5 hours, which Fussey said is shorter than in some other countries assessing LFR.From this sample, the report concluded there was no statistically significant bias at a setting of 0.6 or higher, a claim the Met has repeated to defend the use and expansion of LFR.Fussey said this was far too small a sample to support the Met’s claims. “The MPS [MetropolitanPoliceService] consistently claim their system has been independently tested for bias. Examining this research reveals the data is insufficient to support the claims being made .“The decisive conclusions the Met are stating publicly are based on analysis of just seven false matches. This is from a system that has analysed millions of Londoners’ faces. It is a weak statistical basis to make universal claims from such a small sample of false matches.”The Met now uses LFR at a sensitivity setting of 0.64, which the NPL study said produced no false matches.Fussey said: “According to their own research, false matches were not actually assessed at the settings they claim is free of bias, which is 0.64 or above.“Few, if any, in the scientific community would say the evidence is sufficient to support these claims extrapolated from such a small sample.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The issue here is that the system has not been adequately tested at these different settings, so it is difficult to support these claims.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Met police’s commentary is based on what the independent report found,” she said.“When we use LFR at the setting of 0.64 – which is what we now use – there is no statistically significant bias.“We commissioned the study to understand where potential bias might lie in the algorithm and used the findings to mitigate that risk.“Its findings show us what level to use the algorithm at to avoid bias and we always operate above that level and in a fair way.”At Notting Hill this weekend warning signs will tell people LFR is in use, next to the vans containing the cameras which are linked to a database of wanted suspects.Police believe its use at two sites on the approaches to the carnival will act as a deterrent. At the carnival itself, police are preparing to use retrospective facial recognition to capture suspects for violence and assaults.Fussey said: “Few would doubt the right of police to use technology to keep the public safe, but this needs to be done with proper accountability measures and in accordance with human rights standards.”The Met claims that since 2024, LFR’s false positive rate has been one in every 33,000 cases. It declined to say how many faces had been scanned but it is understood to be in the hundreds of thousands.In 2024 there were 26 false matches, with eight so far in 2025. The Met says none of these people were detained, as once the computer system flags a match, the decision on whether to arrest is made by a police officer.Before the carnival, the Met had arrested 100 people, with 21 recalled to prison and 266 being banned from attending. The force also said it had seized 11 firearms and more than 40 knives.Explore more on these topicsFacial recognitionMetropolitan policePoliceNotting Hill carnivalLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

And, more particularly, tech stocks making huge AI investments that have yet to make a dollar of profit.A recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology report revealed that 95% ofcompanies investing in generative AIhave yet to see any financial returns.This revelation came afterSam Altman, the boss of the ChatGPT owner OpenAI, warned that some company valuations were “insane”.Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at the currency trading firm Swissquote, said: “The [Altman] comments may have been a wake-up call for investors, sparking a sharp pullback in high-flying names.”At the beginning of the week, the share price of the data mining and spyware firmPalantir, which has billions of dollars worth of US government contracts, plunged almost 10%. The AI chip maker Nvidia fell more than 3%, while other AI-linked stocks such as Arm, Oracle and AMD also lost ground.Most pension funds will be invested in these tech companies, alongside more longstanding names such as Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google) and Meta (Facebook).Should fund managers pull out? That would probably be unwise.The scale of investment in AI by the likes of Google and Meta is vast and while the technology’s potential is the subject of much speculation, white-collar workers are becoming more familiar with the supposed benefits with every passing day.Corporate messages asking them to use AI for presentations, report writing and research are a daily occurrence (accompanied, of course, with hollow assurances that job cuts are not being considered).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionMicrosoft’s Copilot and the many other “helpful” AI tools on offer are becoming embedded in office life and beginning to perform large numbers of low-level tasks.If this trend takes off, and in many parts of the economy it already has, there is a soft landing waiting for the tech industry even as some of the flakier, more speculative businesses are weeded out and fail.If anything, a downturn helps the big firms pick up new technological breakthroughs from the wreckage and on the cheap.Palantir’s price-to-earnings ratio is north of 500 when most investors would find themselves getting panicky at anything above 50.Nvidiahas a price-to-earnings ratio of 56.The Palantir/Nvidia ratios could decline as their share price falls more into line with a reasonable prospect of likely earnings, but the businesses are not going to go bust, even in the most severe equity market storms.Trump is another significant supporter, clearing the path for AI to make even deeper inroads into corporate life. His support for cryptocurrencies, including his own, and deregulated social media platforms, including his own, are indications of where his sympathies lie.AI is probably going to be bad for humanity, given that politicians and regulators are light years behind the tycoons and tech magnates backing AI, many of whom see it as a new way to disempower and dominate workers.However, as an investor, AI isn’t going away, crash or no crash.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Stock marketsTechnology sectorComputingChatGPTOpenAISam AltmancommentShareReuse this content"

His office has ramped up social media attacks on Donald Trump, his policies, and, predictably, his bugnuts tweeting. I have witnessed the rise of Gavin Newsom firsthand: from his tenure as mayor of San Francisco to the governorship of my state to thisdeeply embarrassing photowith afuture resident of Mar-a-Lago. At last, the world can finally see the Gavin Newsom I have come to vehemently tolerate – a man with a tendency to stumble into doing the right thing in the most annoying way possible.Newsom is the kind of politician who will seize the moment – legalizing same-sex marriage in San Francisco back in 2004, most significantly – as long as the moment is somewhere near a camera and an operating microphone. We are in one of those dreaded “moments” right now, as Texas gerrymanders itself to rig the midterms in the favor of Republicans. Newsom is taking full advantage,pushing to gerrymander California in responseand turning over one of his office’s social media accounts to run a comic offensive against the White House. In the process, he is doing the thing I hate the most: weaponizing nostalgia.Trump’s presidential philosophy is government by shakedown | Steven GreenhouseRead moreNostalgia is a powerful thing, like a rank body odor or a French cheese. Don’t we all love turning back the hands of time and pretending like we still have all our hair, we can stand for more than 30 minutes of an Oasis concert and Twitter is a thing that matters to normal people? Remember 2017? That was a fun year. The Women’s March, the release of the original Nintendo Switch, and Montenegro joining Nato (ugh, finally). It was certainly a year, was it not? Definitely one of the years. Back then, not a minute would go by without aKrassenstein brothertelling you that the indictments were imminent, that Donald Trump was a lame duck and thepee tapewas just an Amazon Prime delivery away. Robert Mueller was practically Elvis gyrating on the Ed Sullivan Show, he was so beloved by neurotic liberals trying their best to white-knuckle through the first Trump administration. Sometimes, I’ll put on the music video forDespacitoand just vibe on the 2017 of it all. You probably don’t even remember that song exists, but I assure you, it was popular once.Back in those days, we all thought we could mock Trump into oblivion. I certainlytried. Idefinitely failed. But thinking we could tease the man into appeasement was an amusing fantasy. Our first go-round with the Don was something of a satire boom – the Daily Show, the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, digital outlets like Crooked Media. Surely all we’d need to do is make fun of his tan and he’d go away, like a schoolyard bully with a weird birthmark. Despite the best efforts of various Ivy League educated wits, Trump won out with crueler insults, more banal observations and performative intimidation tactics that energized his base. We are now almost a decade into the Trump era and no one on the left has been able to figure out how to cause lasting damage to the Maga mystique that doesn’t involve the Jeffrey Epstein files. So, when I witness the numbing onslaught of Newsom’s@GovPressOfficeaccount, I can’t help but be caught in a reverie that warps me back to the halcyon days of something resembling optimism – when “the resistance” was a hashtag that seemed to have actual meaning.@GovPressOffice is a glorious throwback to 2017. Also, 2018. And 2019. And 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Kamala Harris even tried this same tactic,trolling Trump on social mediaas often as possible. In the minds of the most die-hard political junkies, platforms like X are the ultimate battleground, where hearts and minds can be won over with a bit of sarcasm or a meme ofJD Vance as a baby. At most, that mememight get you deported, but I’m still not convinced it can sway an election. Nevertheless, they persisted. It seems like any Democrat with a shred of national recognition immediately goes into full 2017 “resistance” mode, hoping to trigger the right into some mythical unforced error of political gamesmanship. Please indulge me as I copy/paste an actual tweet from @GovPressOffice. Decide for yourself if you think this is going to sway a voter to move to the left:WOW!!! MY MAPS (THE BEST MAPS EVER MADE) WILL SOON PASS IN THE GREATEST LEGISLATURE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD (NOT JUST AMERICA). AMERICA CAN THANK ME (GAVIN C. NEWSOM) AND TWO VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE – MAGIC MIKE & RAINMAKER ROBERT, WHO LEAD THE LEGISLATURE – TOTAL LEGENDS!!! THESE ARE “PERFECT, BEAUTIFUL” MAPS. BETTER THAN COLUMBUS, BETTER THAN GOOGLE MAPS, BETTER THAN APPLE MAPS (SORRY TIM, NO GOLD BAR FOR ME, BUT I STILL LOVE YOU!). PEOPLE ARE ALREADY SCREAMING “MAMA! MAMA!” AND I SAY, “NO, I AM YOUR DADDY!!!” THE GOLDEN ERA BEGINS IN THE GOLDEN STATE, ALL BECAUSE OF ME, THE PEOPLE’S GOVERNOR, THE CARTOGRAPHER-IN-CHIEF, WHO WILL NOW LET THE PEOPLE VOTE!!! THANK YOU, USA!!! – GCNIf I might go fullr/PeterExplainsTheJokehere, the bit above revolves around the Newsom account mimicking Trump’s tendency to post witless threats and self-aggrandizements in all-caps. Meanwhile, the actual Trump, on his own social media platform, posts strictly within his own version of reality, where deploying the military in Washington DC magically stopped crime, Democrats are twirling their mustaches while plotting to rig elections and the Governor of California is named “Gavin Newscum.” Not even a clever nickname. He foolishly left “Goofy Gavin”, “Blabbin Gavin”, and “Gavin Nonuts” on the table, but no one in the Maga base cares if he’s actually funny, if he has anything witty to say. They like Trump because he’s authentically Trump. He is a fully realized cartoon man impervious to South Park episodes, name-calling and garden variety teasing. Half of the Harris 2024 social media strategy revolved around JD Vance making love to a sofa, but that didn’t translate into actual votes. I guess I can have a mild chuckle in between huffs of misery fumes at the depression factory that is 2025 America.This is not to say that Newsom is a worthless twit who has succeeded because of (and in some ways despite) his beautiful head of hair. No, he’s not worthless. Theredistricting planhe’s enacted here in California is the only reasonable response to the escalation coming from the right. But what is gained from parody? What does mimicry do for the Democrats? It’s just another instance of the other side reinforcing the notion that Trump dictates the terms of engagement. There is a middle ground between “when they go low, we go high” capitulation and “lol I called myself the ‘CARTOGRAPHER IN CHIEF.’” In order to claw back authority and respectability, the Democrats have to stop trying to be Trump and start trying to be something else. Something coherent. Something relatable. Needling Trump is a great way to get engagement, to guarantee clicks and attention. Believe me, I know. But I’m not the governor of California. I’m basically a less successful, long-lost Krassenstein brother hoping to cash in on #resistance. Until the left figures out how to be something other than a pale shadow of their opponent, we’ll keep wishing it was still 2017.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsGavin NewsomOpinionDonald TrumpXcommentShareReuse this content"

Days ago,Donald Trump, former star of NBC’s The Apprentice and current US president, posted a lengthy Truth Social rant in which he (again) threatened the country’s leading cultural institutions to adhere to his political ideology. The target was one he has had in his crosshairs before – the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) – which Trump called “OUT OF CONTROL” in his post. “Everything discussed [in NMAAHC exhibits] is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was,” Trump unloaded. “WOKE IS BROKE,” he continued through his customary use of all caps and misplaced capitalization of common nouns. “We have the HOTTEST Country in the World, and we want people to talk about it, including in our Museums.”The tirade left many wondering what exactly Trump saw as the upsides of slavery, but also where they had previously heard this recycled talking point. The comment seemed to echo comments made just days prior by his fellow reality show bully Jillian Michaels, a former trainer on NBC’s The Biggest Loser, the weight-loss competition show that launched alongside The Apprentice in 2004. Michaels had been making her rounds in media and public appearances, rebranding from verbally abusivefat shamerto Maga influencer.On CNN’s NewsNight, the host Abby Phillips moderated a roundtable discussion on Trump’s months-long overreach into cultural institutions such as the Kennedy Center and the NMAAHC. Michaels hijacked the conversation into a lament about slavery’s prominence in the massively popular museum’s displays on US history. “[Trump] is not whitewashing slavery, he’s not,” Michaels said. “You cannot tie slavery to just one race, which is what every single exhibit [at NMAAHC] does.” Turning towards the representative Ritchie Torres, who was seated beside her, Michaels unloaded popular far-right talking points. “Do you realize that only less than 2% of white Americans owned slaves?” she continued. “Do you realize slavery is thousands of years old? Do you know who was the first race who tried to end slavery?”Torres’s interjections that slavery was a system of white supremacy, not a set of individual white acts, went unaddressed by the TV star. (From 20% to 50% of the white population in southern US states owned enslaved people, and all white people nationwide benefited from slavery’s racial order. Michael’s false claims prompted Phillips to later post apublic correction.)The tirade was an escalation of Trump’s previous open declarations to “restore truth and sanity to American history”, an effort to overhaul exhibits and installations across federally operated museums and galleries and politicize their content, with the NMAAHC locked squarely in the administration’s sights for what it called “corrosive ideology”. Previous edicts about the museum, lovingly nicknamed “The Blacksonian” by many of its patrons, had not specifically identified slavery as the White House’s gripe. But Trump’s Truth Social post more directly reflected a return to a century-old tactic to minimize chattel slavery as “not that bad”.If we have learned anything from reality television, it is that every narrative is scripted. No matter how easily their claims were debunked, both Michaels and Trump were in lock step in their effort to vindicate white people from their role in slavery, both by insisting that slavery’s conditions and aftermath are overblown, and refuting that it played a major role in US history.These assertions are a refresh of a century-old “lost cause” myth spearheaded by the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), an organization of more than 100,000 white women who set out to make slavery respectable again by rebranding the Confederacy’s bloody image. The “genteel ladies” campaign euphemized slave trading as a “celebration of memory” and “a southern way of life”. Like Michaels, Trump and like-minded slavery deniers, proponents of “the lost cause” promoted an outlandishly misleading account of history in which slavery was both irrelevant as the cause of the American civil war, and benevolent because Christianity and plantation life, they said, benefited African-descended people who were otherwise unfit for civilization.UDC members capitalized on their social status as wives and mothers to indoctrinate children, notably through catechisms, the control and production ofschool textbooks, essay and scholarship contests, and their spinoff organizations, like theChildren of the Confederacy. Their purported concern for white children provided a gender-appropriate cover for their goals to terrorize Black people in the south. They took full advantage of the threat of lynching that loomed over any Black person, including children, who dared to challenge a white woman. Confederate statues and memorials, which UDC lobbied to have strategically placed outside courthouses and in public squares, parks and other spaces, were meant to intimidate African Americans who were merely engaging in civic life.Trump’s obsessive preoccupation with the Smithsonian’s 19th installation signals that history is repeating. Since its 2016 opening, the NMAAHC has welcomed more than 10 million in-person visitors, with families and school groups driving much of that number. Across seven floors and 12 galleries, the museum offers a remarkably comprehensive deep dive into the story of Black life in the US. It is as accessible to grammar school pupils as it is impressive to nationally celebrated historians.On his initial tour in 2017, Trumplauded the institutionas “a shining example of African Americans’ incredible contributions to our culture, our society and our history”. Today, the museum serves as a go-to supplement for the Black history curriculums that many American public school systems have stripped or disbanded under Republican state legislatures’ “anti-woke” policies.Trump’s Truth Social post went on to announce that he had instructed his attorneys to “go through the museums and start the exact same process that has been done with colleges and universities”, comparing the funding cuts the administration has wielded over university curricula and research to an overhaul of NMAAHC’s exhibits relevant to slavery.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toOpinion USFree daily newsletterSee things from another point of view with our daily selection of US op-ed pieces.

Vindication, as the organization deployed it, was a tool for vengeance, not justice – divorced from all reality and set on a narrative in which they insisted they were the victims of the very war their families provoked. They perfected a manipulation of public memory that controlled the racial hierarchy by controlling education.The late sociologist and historian James Loewen, who studiedConfederate monuments across the US, once explained that the past is what happened, history is what we say about the past, and some of us believe that should be the same thing. We are locked in a battle, however, with those who seek to pervert history and replace it with a fiction that absolves their present-day wrongdoing.UDC members continued to lobby for revisionist school curricula and the placement of Confederate memorials well into the 20th century, where they fought against Black progress in the civil rights movement. Ultimately, backlashes against Confederate monuments successfullyremoved nearly 100 of themin the protests following the state murder of George Floyd. Still, hundreds more remain, including those Trump hasrecently replaced. He is clinging to a century-old storyline hoping to be renewed for another political season. But it’s old material that isn’t nearly as effective when your opponents already know the playbook.Saida Grundy is an associate professor of sociology and African American studies at Boston University, and the author of Respectable: Politics and Paradox in Making the Morehouse ManExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionMuseumsSlaveryRaceUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Nothing really against those South Park guys – I’ve caught plenty of episodes over its astonishing near-30-year run, and loved the 1999 big-screen movie. But while I haven’t always maintained clockwork viewership of The Simpsons, either, those characters have proved durable enough to revive my interest in episodes old and new. South Park has a thinner bench by comparison, and as the show itself astutely pointed out years ago, it’s difficult for a satirically minded animated sitcom to explore ground that The Simpsons hasn’t covered already. South Park’s political bent, too, has often seemed less varied than the warmer (but still sometimes cutting) social ribbing of Matt Groening’s signature show. It’s a fine line between omnidirectional satire and libertarian crankiness.And yet the27th season of South Parkhas accomplished something vanishingly few of its peers, whether in animation or topical comedy, have been able to do: getting laughs taking shots at the secondTrump administration. It’s not that the White House is beyond reproach. Quite the opposite problem, much-documented: theDonald Trumpcabal is so outsized in its stupidity and cruelty that it’s hard to distend it into a “funny” caricature, even a bleak one. In Trump’s second term, it has only gotten bleaker; jokes that were worn out by the end of 2020 are getting retold with a nasty vengeance, and the bar for cathartic laughter has been raised considerably.Satire at its finest: South Park takes on Trump’s martial takeover, AI and tech brosRead moreFor a comedy fan, this winds up translating to an aversion. The occasional shots taken by The Simpsons somehow don’t land as squarely as they did when aimed at presidents I liked much, much more. I watchSaturday Night Liveevery week, and mostly dread James Austin Johnson’s accurate but ultimately defangedimpression. (Some weeks, Johnson himself seems bummed out to be doing it.) I respect the hell out of Stephen Colbert, but I have never sought out his Trump commentary; I don’t need any more clapter – the reaction encouraged by comedy that wants your approval more than your laughter – in my life. South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone seemed to agree; Parker’s 2017 announcement that they’d grown bored of taking shots at Trump – then barely into his first presidential term – was one of the show’smany controversiesover the years.So how is it that South Park’s revived anti-Trump blows this season have managed to land? A big part of it is precisely Stone and Parker’s allergy to clapter and the grandstanding that inspires it. They obviously resent anything they read as putting on airs and sometimes in the past, this came across as its own form of preachiness, with “everybody chill”-style speeches at an episode’s end that would secretly sound just as prescriptive as the self-righteousness they wanted to send up. With their most recent Trump parody, though, there isn’t much moralizing – just gratifyingly mean caricatures of deserving figures such as Trump,JD Vanceand homeland security secretaryKristi Noem. Some (not all) of their past roastings have verged on point-and-laugh bullying; here are targets worthy of that derision.Some of this derision speaks through the language of South Park itself. Trump isn’t vocally or visually imitated; he’s depicted in a series of repurposed photos, with the same voice and animation technique that Parker and Stone used to bring Saddam Hussein to life in the South Park movie. He’s also given the same sexual partner: amuscled-up and put-upon version of Satan, who has found himself in another toxic relationship. Calling Trump a wannabe dictator doesn’t break new ground, but there’s something satisfying in Stone and Parker using their personal toolkit to draw a line between Trump and Hussein; if they thought it was a histrionic comparison, they’d be making fun of it instead of making it. Similarly, there’s real spite animating the depiction of Noem as adog-murderingzealot whose glamorous face needs to be repeatedly lacquered and reaffixed to her head as she commands an army of Immigration and Customs Enforcement thugs.Lewd, crude and politically astute: South Park’s history of controversyRead moreNot all of the season’s satire has involved making real-life figures regulars on the show. Because South Park’s ensemble has rarely felt as vast or believably developed as Springfield of The Simpsons (or even Arlen on King of the Hill), it’s also flexible enough to turn Randy, Stan’s desperately trend-following dad, into a ketamine-microdosing, tech-bro moron addicted to the soothing, empty reassurances of ChatGPT – the focus ofthe most recent episode, to the point where most of the core child cast doesn’t appear. Surprisingly, this season has deployed forever favorite Cartman more sparingly so far, again getting self-referential in the season’s second episode, where the id-driven and arguably evil little kid is incensed to find out that podcasters have stolen his “shtick” – his pervasive hatefulness, repackaged as a challenge to debate where the aggressor is always the self-appointed winner. Ascribing this “master debater” title to Cartman (alongside a fellow kid serving as an obvious Charlie Kirk/Ben Shapiro stand-in) somehow manages to make this ridiculous behavior funny in its petty smallness without glorifying it.A South Park diehard would probably describe this praise as a fair-weather fan only enjoying the show when it goes after the “right” targets. Maybe that’s true, but it’s also a lot easier to take some joy in savaging Vance as a meme-faced version of a Fantasy Island sidekick than, say, accusing George Lucas and Steven Spielberg of cultural rape. It’s probably wishful thinking to wonder if Parker and Stone might actually move the needle of the perception on tech bros, debate-me podcasters and Trump-world ghouls, especially among the dude demo. But it’s also just a blessed change of pace to see say-anything, first-amendment types finding a fresher target than the wokeness bogeyman. While countless standups continue to whine about being silenced, Parker and Stone seem highly aware of their rarified position (and, asParamountcontractors, alsoawareof what actual political-corporateinterferencelooks like). In a world where Trump’s actual political opponents seem terrified to actually fight him, some well-deserved, point-and-laugh meanness has become a surprising novelty.Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkAnimation on TVTV comedyComedyTelevisionUS televisionDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Wood herself is now the head of the Productivity Commission, alongside the first ever female Treasury secretary, Jenny Wilkinson, and Michele Bullock as governor of the Reserve Bank.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAs Assoc Prof Duygu Yengin has written, research shows thatthis provides an immense opportunity, in that male and female economists often think differently, about “labour markets, taxation, health and the environment, and more broadly on public spending – everything from welfare to the military”.Labor has done some good work so far on the gender pay gap and participation by boosting wages in low paid feminised industries, but women still had towork 50 extra days on averageinto this financial year to earn the same as men did last year.The iron ore deposit has not yet been properly mined.When Sam Mostyn, who is now the governor general, delivered the Women’s Economic Equality Taskforce (Weet) report as chair in August 2023, it showed that thousands of Australian women who were interviewed across the countrywant secure work andrespect.If we are to achieve this, and the productivity gains that will result, we must as a nation advance gender equality in the workplace together with women’s safety.The absence of both is a handbrake on the potential of Australian women and girls, our society and our economy.In itssubmission to the roundtable, violence prevention agency Our Watch points out the economic cost of violence against women in Australia which “is estimated at $21.7 billion annually, with at least $4.7 billion as government expenditure, including $1.9 billion in lost productivity”.Those are the costs of women being killed, beaten, sexually assaulted, families fleeing, crisis housing, legal support, physical and mental health responses and more. All services are chronically underfunded.Increased investment in primary prevention is far better than any attempted cure, just as the Productivity Commission itself pointed out in relation to healthcare in one of its pre-roundtable papers.Meanwhile, Australia ranks equal first in the world for women’s education but is much lower down the list for women’s economic opportunity.Empty corridors and a quiet hum: if there were fireworks at Albanese’s economic roundtable, they were well hiddenRead moreAustralian women are less likely to work full-time than women in many other OECD countries.Most casual workers are women.Women still domost of the unpaid care work, which is essential in keeping the economy functioning.As the National Foundation for Australian Womennotes in its submission, “Australia fails to value unpaid caring work, yet this is an underpinning requirement of reproducing and maintaining the labour force and an important component of economy-wide productivity.”Women also do most of the low-paid care work. In the early childhood education sector, for example, 92% of workers are women.There has been little to no productivity growth in the care sector for two decades. Yet the care economy is the single largest employer in Australia and our fastest growing industry as measured by job growth, by a long way.We must further address the gender super gap and continue working on the stubborn gender pay gap.Female workforce participation is rising but we still get paid less, westill work fewer paid hours, we still work more unpaid hours, we still save less super, and when we hit 55, we’re at the highest risk of homelessness of any demographic.Wood, Wilkinson, Bullock and Mostyn can help drive the response to this, but they remain outliers.Women are still significantly under-represented in leadership positions in the Australian workforce.WGEA data shows female CEOs are paid an average of $158,632 less than male peers. Women make up just 22% of CEOs, 37% of key management roles, and 42% of managers. Just 34% of board members are women – and one in four boards have no women at all.Empowering women is good economic policy and is more than “nice to have”, as one male finance journalist once described to me in the halls of parliament.This watershed economic debate should be about enabling the wellbeing and prosperity ofeveryonein the nation.That would be a productive outcome.Zoe Danielis a three-time ABC foreign correspondent and former independent member for GoldsteinExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyOpinionGenderGender pay gapcommentShareReuse this content"

Which is criminal when there is so much we could doSat 23 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 23 Aug 2025 12.33 EDTShareLots of people told me to not study languages – including my own (monolingual) dad. “You’re never going to be as fluent as a native speaker,” I remember him saying when I was deciding on my university degree. “Why bother?”A little more than a decade later, I’ve collected a wealth of experiences. I’ve staffed Sotheby’s Madrid reception desk, I’ve taught theatre and English to Syrian children excluded from mainstream schools in Beirut. I’ve given a speech on sustainable development goals for Arab audiences at the UN, and I’ve trained journalists in Ecuador’s most dangerous city. I’ve dated men I’ve wanted to, swatted off men who I didn’t, sung songs, cooked recipes, all in languages that are not my native tongue. And most important of all? I’ve changed my dad’s mind.Nick Gibb, the former schools minister, was right this week whenhe told the Timesthat the UK’s decline in language-learning is “damaging to our reputation as a global player”. Our international counterparts are far more multilingual than us; in Europe, we areamong the least likelyto speak a second language. Brits were not always poor language learners – in 1997, we reached ahigh pointwhere 82% of boys and 73% of girls were entered for a modern language at GCSE – but by 2018,that had sunkto 50% of all girls, and only 38% of boys.More democratised access to language-learning – once the preserve of elites, like Etonians and the accomplished young ladies Jane Austen loved writing about – had been under way for most of the 20th century, but it was soured by the fact that language GCSEs were hard. To this day, they are consistently gradedmore severelythan other subjects.But rather than marking exams more generously, challenging the perception that language exams are too onerous, or better equipping schools with higher quality language teaching, the 2004 Labour government decided the solution was to eliminate the requirement to take a language GCSE altogether. It has had a catastrophic effect on language-learning ever since.Some languages are weathering the ensuing collapse in interest better than others;Spanish take-up is healthy and growing, while French appears to be stabilising after a big drop. German entries at GCSE are falling rapidly despite itbeing the most-requested language in UK job ads.Worse, we appear to be going back in time, where language-learning is once again becoming the preserve of the elite; the percentage of year 11 pupils studying a language at GCSE in poorer areassits at around 46-47%compared to affluent areas, which stand a whole 20 percentage points higher.Inevitably, lower language uptake at GCSE triggers an ongoing cave-in among A-levels and university degrees. Even though more people are going to university than ever before, UK applications for undergraduate language degrees have gone down by more than a fifth in the last six years. Universities – especially post-1992 ones – keeplosing their modern languages departments. NeitherBrexitnorthe pandemicwill have helped, curtailing possibilities connected with studying abroad.I was fortunate to go to a school that prioritised languages, but I was even luckier to benefit from exposure to multilingualism, something thatresearch has recently suggestedmakes pupils in England far more motivated to study languages, even when they live in monolingual areas. Where my dad saw little value, my mum – fluent in Italian and the minority language variety my nonna brought with her when she emigrated here from the Ligurian Apennines in the 1950s – encouraged me to add as many languages to my roster as possible.Without the Spanish I started learning as a 13-year-old, the Arabic I started as an 18-year-old and the Italian that has hovered in and out of my life since birth, I wouldn’t be the journalist or person I am today. That’s not only because of the conversations I’ve been able to have or the sources I’ve been able to read; it’s because of the formative life experiences that accompany language-learning. The reason languages are so desired among employers isn’t just for the words and grammar, but because of the soft skills that come with accumulating them – the resilience, the creative thinking, and the openness to new ideas that is demanded of you when you immerse yourself into different cultures.Multilingual people gain access to all of the jobs that require such skills, as well as the cognitive benefits associated with everything from enhanced creativity to possiblydelaying the impacts of Alzheimer’s. Any Britons who assume they can rely on English alone when travelling quickly have that belief dismantled when forced into vulnerable situations abroad, or moments where they are hopelessly incapable of helping people at home. Earlier this summer, an elderly Portuguese woman on the Tube stopped me because she was lost trying to go to a hospital appointment. Unfortunately I only know how to say a smattering of dramaticfadolyrics and “I don’t speak Portuguese” – but my fluent Spanish meant we could understand each other, and I could tell her what stop to get off at.Despite a vague attempt to improve languages’ chances with the English baccalaureate in the 2010s, the situation in the UK has become so bad that the unhinged owl app Duolinguo is now trying to intervene, recently sponsoring a Westminster language-learning challenge getting politicians to out-nerd each other.So how do we resolve this issue?A recent thinktank reportmade immediate recommendations to hire more international language teachers to plug gaps and to keep language-learning as a statutory entitlement for pupils up to 18.I have additional ideas, beginning with better respecting the glittering diversity of languages emigrants bring to the UK. We wrongly dictate that assimilation in western countries requires shifting to English monolingualism, as opposed to developing sophisticated bilingualism across second, third and fourth generations. Leaning into more heritage language-learning opportunities, that both the UK government and international partners can collaborate on, would build international ties along with individuals’ connections to their families and communities.Accounting for our own indigenous languages would be a start, too;when Keir Starmer tweeted“If you want to live in the UK, you should speak English” this year, he ignored the language policies of our devolved nations that do not forget to accommodate Welsh, Gaelic and Scots.Combine the contribution immigrants make to our country with our ancient Celtic languages and one quickly realises the UK is not nearly as monolingual as we assume.Embracing multilingualismas a British trait would probably annoy or confound many. But – as I would relish explaining to you in the four languages I speak – that is precisely the reason why we should do it in the first place.Sophia Smith Galer is a journalist and content creator.

Love it, love it, LOVE IT!As a former neighbourhood sergeant, I strongly believe that community engagement is the heart and soul of policing. The CDS (Counter Dance Squad) at Scotland Yard fears that cops may be distracted, and “less able to respond and intervene swiftly when required”. What a load of Bolshoi!Come on, Sir Mark, be honest. What you really fear is a clip of some pirouetting PC being picked up by the Daily Mail. Causing old Arthur in the Dog and Duck to slam down his pint and scream at the gen Z bartender that he used t’get a clip around the ear’ole from PC Dixon – and if he went home and told his father …And what do cops think about the dance ban? The answer is: total indifference! Most just resent having their weekend cancelled to swelter in heavy boots and cheap Lycra tops.Meanwhile, old Arthur’s now grinding his teeth, screwing up his flat cap and screaming: “Why aren’t they out there catching the real criminals?!” One answer is that many are at the Notting Hill carnival, community policing, but also seeking out the knife-and-gun-toting thieves, robbers and murderers who exploit the event. Of the 349 arrests in 2024, 72 were forcarrying knives or other offensive weapons.A recentPolice Federation survey revealedthat an astounding 89% of cops at last year’s event reported feeling unsafe, and I’m not surprised. For all the jollity, I think the carnival is potentially the most dangerous public event a police officer will ever face. And that’s coming from a copper who survived policing the Scunthorpe United v Grimsby Town, Football League trophy match of 2017. Grimsby lost. Those Codheads can be sore losers!Money, money, moneyBut think of all the overtime, right? Wrong! The biggest gripe from my serving police chums is remuneration! The “national living wage”is now £12.21 per hour. A police officer’s starting salary is £29,907. Whichever way you look at it, it’s an uplift of a little more than a couple of quid for enduring a dire shift pattern, constant abuse and daily risk to life and limb.The Police Federation says that since 2010, police payhas fallen by 21% in real terms. Theresa May is now the chair of the Global Commission on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking. Skills no doubt honed from reforming UK police pay and conditions.Out with the old, out with the newView image in fullscreenPolice officers watch as revellers dance on top of a railway bridge, Notting Hill carnival 2022.Photograph: Alberto Pezzali/APRecently, police chiefs were given powers to quickly sack those who fail vetting checks. Speedy departure of bad cops is a positive. However, hanging on to the good cops is proving challenging:8,795 officers left in the last year, 53% being voluntary resignations.That’s a bit awkward for the government’sneighbourhood policing pledge, to deploy additional personnel to dedicated neighbourhood roles, when there are 1,303 fewer coppers than last year. A puzzle solved by a serving neighbourhood inspector who told me: “We’re bolstering neighbourhood numbers by using cops from crime investigation teams.”To the Home Office boffins currently trying to solve the mystery of the police’s dire recruitment and retention problems, here’s a random idea – pay them properly! In the last five years the number of police officers with second jobshas doubled. No wonder carnival cops have been throwing some shapes – they’re practising fortheir second jobsas exotic dancers. At least the Lycra comes in handy.So are we human, or are we dancer?Here’s another secret I can reveal: police officers are almost human! (Not the traffic cops obviously.) Did you see the viral clip of a cop getting a cameraphone shoved in his face at a recent protest? In a sort of reverse “no comment” interview, he remained silent, as the interviewer repeatedly asked for his views on the protest, inferred that his children would look back and judge him and suggested he should quit the police. Perhaps they see a scenario in which every cop resigning would result in a spontaneous VE Day vibe and a universal outbreak of peace and goodwill? There’d be an outbreak all right – but of total chaos!No one craves depoliticisation more than a frontline cop. Please try not to blame them for complying with and enforcing the law. The laws brought in by parliament, made up of people that you elected to represent you.So if you see a copper this weekend, spread the love, be friendly, give them a smile. But don’t ask them to dance!That’s all, I’m off for a pint with angry Arthur, to talk about how it used to be in the good old days …Alfie Moore is an ex-police officer, writer, standup comedian and radio presenterDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The creators explain how this deliriously fun music went viralIan McQuaidSat 23 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTShareAt this year’s Fête de la Musique in Paris, British ravers who had streamed over to enjoy the annual street party – think Notting Hill carnival without the procession – found themselves hearing, and then swiftly dancing to, a wildly uptempo tune calledBouwéy.Built from a languid vocal at odds with clattering African percussion, the track bowled out from sound systems and car windows, quite unlike anything else: a defining song of the summer. Made by Guadeloupean act 1T1, Bouwéy has now hit 12m views on YouTube. But its frenetic pace and startling synth work haven’t arrived in a vacuum – instead it is the vanguard of a sound known as bouyon, part of a whirlwind of dance genres leaping out from the Caribbean to the world, including atNotting Hill carnivalthis weekend.“The bouyon is a faster riddim,” chuckles Hillary “Tilly” Thomas over the phone. “You have to drink some rum – it’s carnival music, not everyone can handle it. You have to be crazy!”Tilly, a mainstay in the bouyon scene since the 00s, now manages rising Dominican star DJ Taffy: countless vocalists have hopped on to his frenetic, warbling instrumentalFunny Riddim. “Bouyon is a Dominican French word meaning a mixture of foods,” Tilly says. “Let’s say you’re cooking; you put yam, banana, chicken, fish, dumpling with all the seasonings, it’s an all in one dish. So the music is a fusion of African beats, soca, EDM, the Haitian music kompa, French music and calypso. Like the food, we put it all together to make one pot, it’s a fusion of all Caribbean music. And then it has the ‘dom dom dom’” – he makes the unmistakable sound of a thudding kick drum. “That’s how you know it’s bouyon.”It’s the genre’s sexualised lyrics – known as “nasty business” in Dominica – that have really turned heads, though, delighting young fans but also dismayingCaribbeanradio station bosses. “The nastiness [paired] with the pulsating rhythm, it really and truly brought the music to the world,” Tilly says. “Controversy sells!With only 44 million people spread across its islands, the Caribbean has had an extraordinarily disproportionate impact on music around the globe. Often western media will use Jamaican culture as interchangeable with that of the whole Caribbean, and while reggae and dancehall remain in rude health, their international acclaim can obscure the fact that the other islands have been gestating their own styles for decades.Tilly is at pains to point out that bouyon is not new – he mentions 90s big bands such as WCK and Triple 0 as laying the groundwork, followed by 2010s breakthrough acts such as Asa Bantan and the producer Arade Moses, who has acted as mentor for DJ Taffy. But something has changed since 2020: cheap production technology, the availability of low cost digital distribution (along with the late arrival of Spotify to the Caribbean in 2021), and the rise of TikTok have all conspired to push these high tempo styles into the limelight.This has spread beyond bouyon. In St Lucia, the local variant of the sound is known as dennery segment, the name deriving from the village Dennery where many of the artists originated. Over the last year, scene leader Bozo, who produces under the name of Bad Sound, has had tracks such asBoth Twanche Riddim Refixplayed everywhere from St Lucian raves to London’s tastemakingNTS Radio.He also attributes this newfound success to his ability to blend different styles: the Both Twanche remix fuses dennery segment with the insistent house music of New Jersey, along with a sample from Portuguese producer DJ Marfox. While to the uninitiated dennery may sound like a hyperspeed cousin of soca – the already rapidly undulating iteration of calypso – Bozo points to Africa as the prime source of inspiration. “Kuduro is the bigger influence,” he tells me, referring to the similarly high tempo Angolan dance style. “We try to merge other genres together.”This magpie mix of styles, frenetic pace, and scandalous lyrics has made bouyon and dennery the perfect soundtrack for TikTok’s attention grabbing accounts. But as kids from London, Paris and New York have started tuning in to the sound, not everyone at home has been quick to welcome the success.UK reggae pioneers Steel Pulse: ‘We told punk fans – you can pogo, but please don’t spit at us’Read more“There was a point in time,” Bozo recalls, “when the radio stations wanted to ban the genre because they said it was too explicit. Then when the songs started blowing up, they thought: ‘OK, maybe we’ll give it a try.’ Now we embrace it as our own. Social media has played a big part.”For his part, Tilly thinks that the use of explicit lyrics was just a stepping stone to breaking through to a wider audience. “I told the guys making it: ‘Don’t worry, I’ll take the blame for the lyrics.’ We used the nasty business to get the music out in the world. Now we’ve done that, we’re back making real bouyon; love songs, serious songs.”He may be right. The success of a lyrically PG track such as Bouwéy has proved that controversial lyrics aren’t needed for success, and the producer Arade Moses, on the line with Tilly, is certain. “We always knew it would go somewhere,” he says. “It’s so energy-driven, and the way the youth react to it is so different. True bouyon is too melodic to be stopped!”Explore more on these topicsMusicNotting Hill carnivalFestivalsCaribbeanJamaicaSt LuciaHaitifeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 20 books they didn’t want you to readFrom Instagram poetry to Greek classics, the works of fiction that have caused uproar through history – and into the presentSteven PooleSat 23 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTShareThe banning of books, it would be easy to think, is a relic of less enlightened ages. The Catholic church, in a last spasm of rectitude, added Jean-Paul Sartre, Alberto Moravia and Simone de Beauvoir to its Index of Forbidden Books during the 1940s and 50s, but then abandoned the list, which had lasted four centuries, in 1966.Public book burnings by Nazis or McCarthyites, too, might be assumed to be nothing more than a baleful warning from the past. Yet the burning of books still appears an irresistible act to some – even in the country with the strongest statutory protection of free speech, the United States. In 2019,students at Georgia Southern University burned copiesof visiting Cuban-American author Jennine Capó Crucet’s Make Your Home Among Strangers, some shouting “Trump 2020!”. In 2022, the Nashville pastor Greg Lockeheld a public bonfirefor “demonic” books, including the Harry Potter and Twilight series.Censorship used to occur largely at the level of governments or other transnational authorities. It still does in authoritarian countries such as Iran and China, but western states generally liberalised in the mid-20th century. Yet a weaker form of censorship has long persisted within the American school system, where individual books are subject to “challenge” by parents who consider them inappropriate material for their children. Often, school boards will respond by removing those books from school libraries, in which case they have effectively been banned.The phenomenonhas accelerated in recent years. The machinery of school censorship in the US has also become significantly more corporate. According to the American Library Association’s analysis of its 2024 data, “the majority of book censorship attempts are now originating from organised movements. Pressure groups and government entities that include elected officials, board members and administrators initiated 72% of demands to censor books in school and public libraries.” Between 2001 and 2020, such groups challenged an average of 46 titles per year. Last year,they challenged 4,190 titles in 12 months.Donald Trump’s crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in schools and universities has led some school districts in Texas and Florida to proactively remove shelf-fulls of potential offenders within the last 12 months. Earlier this year, meanwhile, a man went into a public library in Ohio, checked out a number of books on Jewish, Black and LGBTQ+ history,and burned them all. The caption to a video of the bonfire read: “We are cleansing our libraries of degenerate filth.” Joseph Goebbels would have approved.Here, then, is a selection of other books that have been considered degenerate filth …View image in fullscreenOryx and CrakebyMargaret AtwoodAtwood’s 2003 post-apocalyptic fantasia, whose heroes smoke weed and watch very bad things on the internet before their everyday lives are swept away by a global pandemic, is among the most widely sanctioned by American schools. The particularly censorious Utah State Board of Education even bans pupils from carrying a copy into school to read in their personal time. All such perilous tomes, advises the board, must not be given away or resold but instead sent to a specified warehouse in a box clearly marked “sensitive materials”. Not to be outdone, in 2024 a Texas school district banned Oryx and Crake because it promoted “gender fluidity”.View image in fullscreenHarry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stoneby JK RowlingThe famous children’s books about witches and wizards might be more likely to attract opprobrium these days on the grounds of the author’s political opinions, but long before that, Potterphobes were trying to get the books off school shelves in the US on the grounds that they glorify the occult or actually “promote witchcraft”. They succeeded in a few cases, such as Zeeland, Michigan in 1999, andNashville, Tennessee, in 2019. Which begs the question, can you promote something if it doesn’t exist?View image in fullscreenMilk and Honeyby Rupi KaurThe Indian-Canadian poet rose to fame on Instagram, and this collection of social media-friendly minimalist verse was initially self-published in 2014 before coming out commercially and going on to sell more than 11m copies. Popularity, however, is no defence against the literary‑prohibition complex, which in this case cited not Kaur’s refusal to employ upper-case letters but the fact that some of her poems explore themes of sexual assault. It was the joint-ninth most-banned book by US school districts in the 2022-23 school year and remains off limits in districts across eight states.View image in fullscreenThe Kite Runnerby Khaled HosseiniHosseini’s 2003 novel set in Afghanistan before the Soviet occupation and then under the Taliban, which has sold more than 8m copies worldwide, has long been among the most banned books in US school districts, for its depictions of homosexuality, violence, or inter-Afghan ethnic tensions. The 2007 film adaptation wasbanned in Afghanistanitself under the government of Hamid Karzai. The Kite Runner is now one of many books removed from shelves in schools run by the US Department of Defense pending a review announced in 2024 – a ban that chimes with Donald Trump’s targeting of DEI.View image in fullscreenNineteen Eighty-Fourby George OrwellOrwell’s story of totalitarian truth-twisting may have been partly inspired by his experience of working for the BBC, but the Soviets felt it was obviously aimed at them, and so the novel was banned in the USSR until 1988, along with homegrown masterworks such as Vasily Grossman’s second world war epic Life and Fate. But Orwell’s relevance has not since diminished: Russians protesting against the Ukraine war have been arrested for giving out free copies of Nineteen Eighty-Four, while it remains forbidden to mention the novel’s title on Chinese social media.The Satanic Versesby Salman RushdieThe man who stabbed Rushdie in 2022, in an attempt to fulfil the Iranian fatwa, said at his sentencing that the writer “wants to bully other people. I don’t agree with that.” Apparently trying to kill people doesn’t count. Rushdie’s 1988 novel, which contains a dream-sequence riff on the life of the prophet Muhammad, was publicly burned in Bolton and Bradford, and banned in many countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sudan, Sri Lanka and Venezuela. In India, though, the original banning order seems to have been lost, leading a court to state in 2024 that it may no longer be valid.View image in fullscreenThe Bluest Eyeby Toni MorrisonMorrison’s debut novel, a fable about a young Black girl in the US who wishes her eyes would turn blue so that she would be perceived as beautiful, remains surprisingly controversial for a book that was published 55 years ago, coming in third on the American Library Association’s list ofmost frequently challenged books in 2024, and being banned in 29 school districts in the 2022-3 school year. Her later novel Beloved is almost as popular a target, proving that winning a Nobel prize in literature does not suffice to make your work suitable for teenagers.View image in fullscreenPersepolisby Marjane SatrapiThis graphic novel about a young woman growing up during the Islamic revolution in Iran was originally published in French in 2000. It was banned (as the author had foreseen) in Iran and for a while in Lebanon, but controversy struck when it wasbanned by the public schools of Chicago in 2013. That decision was later reversed, but Persepolis continues to be challenged and banned in states including, in 2023 and 24, Alaska, Iowa and Wisconsin. Such bans usually cite the book’s “graphic language and images” (a graphic novel is indeed likely to contain graphic images), though one complaining parent wrote to her Illinois school board to ask “why a book about Muslims was assigned on September 11”.View image in fullscreenChina Dreamby Ma JianIf you wanted to curry favour with the Chinese Communist party, you probably wouldn’t use as your novel’s title a phrase taken from President Xi himself, which he uses to describe a “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”, or indeed have as narrator an ambitious provincial political operative whose job is, as Ma has explained, “to suppress memories of the past and control speech in the present”. This 2018 novel is of course banned in China, as all Ma’s work has been since 1987, but it was the first that no Hong Kong publisher would touch, either. The party, he says, has “an army of censors”.View image in fullscreenLolitaby Vladimir NabokovThe novel that made Nabokov’s fortune was first published in France in 1955, since no American publisher would risk it. Its English-language publisher in France, Olympia Press, lost a lawsuit with the government the following year and the book was banned from sale. Meanwhile in Britain, it was illegal to import such “utter filth” and publication in the UK, as well as in Argentina and South Africa, was banned for several years: in New Zealand, it became legal only in 1964. For the New York Times in 1958 (when the French ban was lifted), Orville Prescott judged the novel “dull, dull, dull in a pretentious, florid and archly fatuous fashion”, and also “repulsive”. It is currently banned in three American school districts.View image in fullscreenNineteen Minutesby Jodi PicoultThis 2007 novel about a school shooting has the dubious honour of currently being the most widely sanctioned book by school districts in the US, according to writers’ group PEN America, with 98 bans. Does suppressing fiction about school shootings reduce the number of actual school shootings? This remains to be demonstrated. In any case, the most commonly cited reason for deeming Picoult’s novel unsuitable for teenagers is, as she explained at the Hay festival last year, her use on page 313 of the word “erection”.View image in fullscreenLady Chatterley’s Loverby DH LawrenceThe subject of the most celebrated obscenity trial of the 20th century, Lawrence’s pastoral romp was banned in Britain and other countries after its original private publication in 1928, though heavily expurgated versions were made available in the US and UK in 1932. Not until 1960 did a mainstream publisher, Penguin Books, attempt to bring out the full text, prompting a showdown with the government. “Is it a book you would have lying around in your own house?” asked the lead prosecutor on behalf of the Crown. “Is it a book you would even wish your wife or your servants to read?” The answer seemed to be yes, as Penguin won.Thirteen Reasons Whyby Jay AsherTV adaptations are usually good news for novels. After the 2017 Netflix adaptation of Asher’s YA teen-suicide novel hit the screens, the book was banned by school districts in eight US states. Some argued that the more sensationalised TV version was much more likely to have encouraged a seeming rash of real-life suicides in the following months. Banning the text, the author told a PBS interviewer, was likely to be counterproductive: “If we say issues of teen suicide, drinking, sex or sexual assaults are inappropriate, we’re telling teens who may identify with those themes that there isn’t a safe space for them.”View image in fullscreenLysistrataby AristophanesAristophanes’s 2,500-year-old comedy about women who go on sex strike in order to stop the Greek city states from fighting each other is plainly likely to sap the masculine spirit of any modern nation-state that emphasises marital virtue. Logical, then, that it should have been banned in its homeland under the Nazi occupation and then under the military junta that took over Greece in 1967. From 1873, meanwhile, it was also banned in the US under the Comstock laws that prohibited lewd or obscene material from being sent through the post, a ban that was successfully overturned only in 1954.View image in fullscreenThe Hate U Giveby Angie ThomasThomas’s much-admired YA novel about a Black teenager who sees her close friend shot by a police officer has, predictably, come high on the lists of books that are “most challenged” in American school districts since it was published in 2017. The various reasons include profanity, drug use and sexual references but also “racially insensitive language” – the latter a concern cited by the white superintendent of the Katy Independent School District in Texas, who personally pulled copies off the shelves. “You’re basically telling the kids … that their stories shouldn’t be told,”Thomas responded. “Well, I’m going to tell them even louder. Thanks for igniting the fire.”View image in fullscreenFanny Hillby John ClelandCleland wrote this pioneering 18th-century tract of very bawdy fiction – ostensibly the “memoirs of a woman of pleasure” – while in debtors’ prison. Within a year of its publication his publishers had been hauled to court on suspicion of “corrupting the King’s subjects” and the book was officially withdrawn, though samizdat copies continued to circulate. In the early 19th century a pirated version was published in the US, leading to that publisher’s conviction in Massachusetts for printing something so “lewd and obscene”. Remarkably, police seized a new edition of the novel in London in the 1960s under the Obscene Publications Act of 1959, and the unexpurgated Fanny was not legally revealed until 1970.View image in fullscreenThe Witchesby Roald DahlDahl’s oeuvre has recently been the subject of enthusiastic Bowdlerisation by Puffin, which releasedpolitically corrected versionsof his texts in 2023 that, among other things, removed the word “fat”. But The Witches (1983) had already long been the subject of complaints in American schools. While liberal critics thought it misogynist because Dahl writes that witches are always women, concerned American parents had it banned in Dallas, Oregon for promoting occultism, and in Dublin, Ohio on the curious grounds that it was “derogatory to children”.View image in fullscreenAmerican Psychoby Bret Easton EllisEllis’s satirical masterpiece of men’s fashion, 1980s music pedantry and ultraviolence, having been dropped by its original publisher Simon & Schuster only three months before its publication date and then rescued by Vintage, has excited outrage in the censorially minded forever after. In the late 1990s Germany restricted sales to adults only, and for many years it was officially banned from sale in the state of Queensland, Australia, though in one of literary freedom’s smallest ever victories it can now be purchased shrink-wrapped, as long as you are over 18.View image in fullscreenThe Handmaid’s Taleby Margaret AtwoodAny author who appears twice on such a list must be doing something right. Since her most famous novel is about a future United States devolving into a repressive sexist theocracy, the routine rightwing attempts to remove it from schools in the present-day US do come across as a case of protesting too much. The Handmaid’s Tale has been removed from school libraries in at least 10 US states. After it was made unavailable to high-school students in Madison County, Virginia, in 2023, Atwood suggested that perhaps the censorious wonks hoped to get teenagers interested in sex again by making mentions of it in print forbidden – and so irresistible. It remains banned in 67 US school districts.View image in fullscreenSlaughterhouse-Fiveby Kurt VonnegutVonnegut’s first bestseller, centring on the firebombing of Dresden (which he had witnessed first-hand), but also with a satirically freewheeling attitude to matters religious, sexual and cosmic, was something of a pioneer in the school-banning stakes. A mere three years after its 1969 publication, it was banned in schools in Oakland, Michigan for being, as a judge thought, “depraved, immoral, psychotic, vulgar and anti-Christian”. In 1973, copies were burned in North Dakota because of its “obscene language”. In 2010 a college professor complained: “This is a book that contains so much profane language, it would make a sailor blush with shame.” In 2024, the novel was banned by school boards in Texas andFlorida.

The judge said that while she accepted some of Clarke’s evidence, “overall I find that he was not a credible or reliable witness”.Harriet Wistrich, lawyer and chief executive of the Centre for Women’s Justice, said the judgment was “great news” and “a blow to wealthy and famous men who think they can use money to silence women”.“Noel Clarke could easily have avoided being named as a sexual predator accused of harassing women. All he had to do was not act in ways that constitute sexual harassment,” said Karen Ingala Smith, former chief executive of domestic and sexual violence charity nia.“Clarke now adds himself to the list of wealthy abusive men who have tried and failed to use the law to minimise, hide or deny their behaviour,” she added. “My thoughts are with his victims and I am glad justice has been upheld.”Charlotte Proudman, a barrister whose book He Said, She Said revealed how women are silenced in the family courts, said: “This judgment is a landmark moment for survivors of sexual ​misconduct and for investigative journalism.“The court’s finding that the Guardian’s reporting was substantially true sends a clear message: women who come forward should be believed, and journalists who investigate abuse play a vital role in holding perpetrators to account.“It is a victory not just for the women who bravely spoke out, but for press freedom and public interest reporting as a whole.”Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: “It is vital that there is freedom to report on cases like this, yet we know that journalists are often held back from reporting due to the threat of legal action from those with power and status.“The law should not be weaponised by perpetrators to silence survivors.

Nicoresti pockets £10,000 in prize money and, on accepting the award, joked they had promised their partner the win a year ago to help pay for their upcoming wedding.At a ceremony hosted very amusingly bylast year’s winner Amy Gledhill, the best newcomer prize, worth £5,000, was won by Ayoade Bamgboye, forthe show Swings and Roundabouts. The Londoner, who was raised in Nigeria, was in tears on receiving the award, which has in the past launched the careers of acts including Sarah Millican, Harry Hill and The Mighty Boosh. The Victoria Wood award, presented to those who “embody the true spirit of the fringe”, went toComedy Club 4 Kids, which runs children’s standup shows and workshops, on its 20th anniversary.View image in fullscreenAyoade Bamgboye won best newcomer with the show Swings and Roundabouts.Photograph: Alan RennieThe director of the comedy awards, the West End theatre producer Nica Burns, said: “Our 2025 winners capture the spirit of comedy right now: bold, brilliant and deeply connected to audiences. In different ways, they’ve each created shows that feel utterly of this moment, sparking laughter while saying something lasting. Together, they remind us why the fringe matters, a place where the freshest voices can shine.”Traditionally rounding off the three-plus-week festival, the ceremony took place at noon on Saturday before an audience of comics and industry figures. Stepping into a lineage of irreverent co-hosts of the award, the former winners Adam Riches and John Kearns appeared in character ascrooners Ball and Boe, delivering edgy gags – as Gledhill did – about the fringe’s ambivalent relationship with Scottish comedy and the residents of Edinburgh.Give or take the leagues-ahead quality of the former best newcomerCat Cohen’s show Broad Strokes, mystifyingly not represented on the shortlist (and attended last night by Tina Fey), Nicoresti’s victory was well earned. Pivoting this year to high-joke-count standup after finding early success with more leftfield work (they are a prominent member of a comedy collective called Weirdos), their show addresses life as a trans woman in a spirit of joy, playfulness and self-irony that could clearly capture the hearts of mainstream audiences.I welcome their win – although I’d have been equally happy to see another star-in-the-makingJohn Tothillrewarded. After brushes with malaria and appendicitis in recent years (as recounted in this year’s show), Tothill must content himself with at least having completed his first fringe runnotto result in a near-death experience.A nomination for the queer Canadian performance art/comedy duo the Creepy Boys, with their show Slugs, ensured welcome representation at comedy’s top table for the fringiest of fringe work. Bamgboye’s win was incontrovertible: sharp, commanding and with star quality in spades, she’s going places. Hopefully one of those places will be next year’s fringe. The festival continues to be the most electrifying destination in live comedy.Figures to be released in the coming weeks will demonstrate how the event has fared commercially in tough times for the performing arts. But, as the comedy awards again proved, for new talent, wild creativity and big laughs – and for practitioners and audience both – the Edinburgh fringe remains the most thrilling place to be.Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)Awards and prizesFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Whether cosy or brutal, true-crime-ish or fictional, filled with forensic crime scenes and hazmat-suited people shuffling out of despoiled apartments, or with twinkly-eyed character actors sampling cake and making coppers look like chumps, or with stylish lone women menaced by a criminal mystery that only they can solve … crime is everywhere, and showing it’s a solid bet at the movies.True crime and cold crime podcast fanciers are being catered for, and lovers of genteel murder mysteries, and those who might enjoy a sophisticated comic twist on crime in a luxurious or blue-collar setting. Streaming platforms have shown that documentaries about crime get views, and terrestrial television has long since allowed drama to be dominated by crime. The movies are now taking the hint.There is tasty-looking fare with The Woman in Cabin 10, adapted from the page-turner by Ruth Ware, with Keira Knightley as a lone travel writer on a luxurious cruise liner who is convinced she has seen someone thrown overboard but can’t find any way of proving it. Veteran feelgood director Chris Columbus has taken on Richard Osman’s smash hit novel The Thursday Murder Club, with Helen Mirren, Celia Imrie, Ben Kingsley and Pierce Brosnan as the quirky residents in a British retirement community who with indomitable grit solve crimes that have left the uniformed police removing their helmets to scratch their heads.But heavy-hitter directors are also giving us films with a crime tinge.Darren Aronofskyhas pivoted from the sensitive body-image themes of his previous film The Whale, to make Caught Stealing, based on the cult bestseller by Charlie Huston, with Austin Butler as a former baseball player in New York who gets mixed up with the city’s criminal underbelly.Paul Thomas Anderson is about to give us what promises to be a black comic paranoid fantasia on the subject of all sorts of crime, withOne Battle After Another, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s novel Vineland.Perhaps the most startling auteur take on crime this autumn is Kelly Reichardt’s fascinatingThe Mastermind, starring Josh O’Connor. This famously quietist and realist film-maker has now created her own intriguing version of the heist drama. Ocean’s Eleven it isn’t, but in its intimate ordinariness, its unhurried ambient detail and moment-by-moment observational detail, is weirdly gripping. O’Connor plays an art school dropout and loser in 1960s Massachusetts who figures he can pay a couple of goons and a getaway driver to help him steal four paintings from a museum, having already established, in an unobtrusively nailbiting initial scene, that he can pinch objects from a glass cabinet without anyone noticing. But he winds up having to make a chaotic getaway himself.By way of contrast there is the grandiose brashness of Spike Lee, who offers his own defiantly personal take on Akira Kurosawa’s 1963 noirHigh and Low– pumping up the remake with superlatives in the title,Highest 2 Lowest– with Denzel Washington as a big-shot music producer whose godson is accidentally taken by kidnappers. A far-fetched suspense sequence set on a New York subway train has hints of that 70s crime classicThe Taking of Pelham 123, and the pure chutzpah and sweep of the film is extremely enjoyable, though perhaps Japanese cinema purists will not like it.View image in fullscreenGrimy allure … Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst in The Roofman.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyDerek Cianfrance is a director associated with romance and with realist emotional complexity, but he too has now succumbed to the grimy allure of true-crime with The Roofman, starring Channing Tatum as Jeffrey Manchester. In the 1990s, Manchester became a US pop-culture antihero in some quarters, dubbed “The Roofman” by the press for his habit of breaking into branches of McDonald’s through the roof in the dead of night, hiding in the lavatories, and then at opening time, emerging and robbing everyone. The movie promises to be part of that 90s-style black-comic variant of crime that is proving popular again.And quite aside from these single-issue prestige features, there is the return of Rian Johnson’s wildly popular crime movie series Knives Out, which gave Daniel Craig a returning franchise gig at the very moment he had stepped down from James Bond. He returns as droll detective Benoit Blanc in Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, which has a religious theme and the same sprightly tongue-in-cheek tone. The title might be a playful tribute to the courage of one of its actors: Jeremy Renner, making his first film since his near-death experience of being run over by a snowplough in 2023.Crime, it seems, is coming in many flavours.Explore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsPaul Thomas AndersonSpike LeeKelly ReichardtDarren AronofskyFilm adaptationsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She says they are always about nations and leaders and never about the people directly affected.Fuselage shows that there is a good reason for this: human interest stories (of which there are a lot) tend to tell you only that people get sad when sad things happen. Just like this play.Imagine if there had been an episode of the TV seriesFamein which the writers had decided to get serious. As well as following a group of drama students in their quest for stardom, they would include a global terror incident. The downing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, for example.Faustus in Africa! review – William Kentridge’s devilishly clever twist on damnationRead moreThis is the setup for Fuselage. It is a routine story of student life – classes, crushes and clashes – brought to a halt by the bombing of the plane on 21 December 1988. Had Lareau been able to afford to change her ticket, she would have joined 35 classmates from Syracuse University on the fated flight.Where previous Lockerbie dramas, such as Des Dillon’sLockerbie 103and David Benson’sLockerbie: Unfinished Business, have found their anger in causes and cover-ups, this one talks nebulously of “terrorists” and presents the death of Lareau’s fellow students, including her best friend Theodora Cohen, not as a matter of wider public concern but as a personal outrage. It is astonishingly devoid of politics.Lareau suffered a devastating loss and the emotional toll must have been unbearable, but the play’s lack of context, barring some scene-setting clips, turns a globally significant attack into something small and private. Makaela Milburn’s production, also starring Peter Dylan O’Connor and Brenda Joyner, manipulates the audience into empathetic sobs and changes nothing.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalLockerbie plane bombingScotlandreviewsShareReuse this content"

How sweet.’ It’s like, excuse my language: ‘Fuck off.’ There’s something very condescending about some people’s attitudes and I think they think they are being kind and generous. But they’re not. They’re being insulting.”She recalled the words of her mother, who told her never to be afraid of getting older, and said there were great things about ageing: You “lose certain stuff but you gain other stuff”.“The tech bros think their billions are somehow going to hold back time,” she said. “They haven’t learnt my mum’s lesson. It’s a natural wave of life that has been going on for billions of years and it’s beautiful to be part of that wave.“It’s what humanity is all about in the end. So it’s important not to wimp out. You’re not going to be 30 when you’re 50. You’re just not.”Mirren has been reminded of mortality throughout her life by the deaths of loved ones. Her younger brother, Peter, died of skin cancer at 54 in 2002, and her stepson Rio Hackford died at 51 of cancer in 2022.“As you travel through life you realise death is absolutely part of life. And it’s always tragic and it can happen when you’re young,” she said.In The Thursday Murder Club, Mirren playing the former spy Elizabeth, who runs a murder investigation group alongside fellow residents of a retirement community.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And it isn’t exactly flattering to the likes of Boy George, Vanilla Ice and TLCRhik SamadderSat 23 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTShareIwould like to understand K-pop better, as I believe it is very popular with the kids. That sentence is a hard-working one: it introduces the information that I have spent this week watching the new Apple TV+ show KPopped (from Friday 29 August), while suggesting I am too old to have any hope of success. But it’s nowhere near as hard-working as a Korean pop star.This battle of the bands-style show aims to raise awareness of K-pop in the west like it’s lymphatic filariasis or something. The format reminds me of PE lessons. You know how gym teachers split groups of friends up, so they concentrate? Here, Korean boy and girl groups such as JO1 and Blackswan are split in half. Each half works with a famous western pop artist, re-tooling their best-known song in K-pop mode. The resulting performances are voted for by the studio audience, and the winner gets – well, nothing. An injection of relevance.The show is produced and hosted by rapperMegan Thee Stallion– with Gangnam Style’sPsyas co-host. I have spent five years trying to understand why Megan Thee Stallion is called that. Whenever I ask the internet, it assumes I’m questioning the horse bit. (She is statuesque, like a stallion, which seems self-explanatory.) It’s actually the Elizabethan English in the middle I’m intrigued by. Thee? An archaic form of address used in place of “you”? I guess no one wants to get pronouns wrong, so they leave it alone.The format is confusing, too. Each episode has two famous western artists competing against each other, supported by one mega-famous K-pop band, who are battling themselves. So, Megan Thee Stallion v R&B veteran Patti LaBelle, each with half of Billie. Or 80s stars Taylor Dayne v Vanilla Ice, each teamed with half of girl group Kep1er. But when I jump straight to the Spice Girls ep, it turns out to just be Mel B and Emma Bunton. Rather than splitting up – too triggering? – Scary and Baby both perform with both groups, working against the show’s competitive logic. Also, watching a studio vote after the fact just isn’t that exciting.View image in fullscreenNew attitude … Patti LaBelle in KPopped.Photograph: Courtesy of AppleWhat I am gripped by is the balance of power in the rehearsal rooms. The globally popular K-poppers have the grace and uncanny communication of synchronised swimmers. Perfect features, skin like peach blossom. Drilled within a hyper-exacting star system, they dance like a murmuration of swallows, or a handful of diamonds thrown in the air. The westerners, by comparison, look like dead weight. They dance like Rocky Balboa. They move less often than a 90-year-old in rent-controlled property. You can see their aura draining.“Finally, we’re having a laugh!” Mel B exclaims, pulling out an intentionally hapless cartwheel in rehearsals, to polite titters. Some of this is to do with age, but not all of it. I love Emma Bunton, but can’t see her popping or locking. Even Thee Stallion, no slouch, looks almost static. I’ve never seen anyone look less impressed than Colombian singerJ Balvinbeing shown around a South Korean market. He’s worried, is the thing. He looks even more dejected once he gets into rehearsals with boybandAteez. “Shall we show him an easy one?” one of them says, in Korean.The problem is that our pop stars are, above all, salespeople of their own charisma, which they cannot subsume. It’s an existential nightmare for them to share the stage. Korea, like most Asian countries, values group harmony, cooperation, respect for elders and social hierarchy. You’ve never seen such polite celebs. “I think we will win” is the sassiest they get. Our performers are like badly behaved schoolkids, acting out because they’re falling behind in history.I understand K-pop now. Impeccable choreography, maximalist production and millions of ideas. But it’s still our guys I’m tuning in for, to see who handles the pressure least well. Will Boy George say something cutting? Will TLC cause an international incident? Will Vanilla Ice get detention for smoking? Who will these legends prove themselves to be, when they’re not the most popular person in the room? KPopped isn’t thee best talent show ever created, but it may be thee most revealing.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nothing really against those South Park guys – I’ve caught plenty of episodes over its astonishing near-30-year run, and loved the 1999 big-screen movie. But while I haven’t always maintained clockwork viewership of The Simpsons, either, those characters have proved durable enough to revive my interest in episodes old and new. South Park has a thinner bench by comparison, and as the show itself astutely pointed out years ago, it’s difficult for a satirically minded animated sitcom to explore ground that The Simpsons hasn’t covered already. South Park’s political bent, too, has often seemed less varied than the warmer (but still sometimes cutting) social ribbing of Matt Groening’s signature show. It’s a fine line between omnidirectional satire and libertarian crankiness.And yet the27th season of South Parkhas accomplished something vanishingly few of its peers, whether in animation or topical comedy, have been able to do: getting laughs taking shots at the secondTrump administration. It’s not that the White House is beyond reproach. Quite the opposite problem, much-documented: theDonald Trumpcabal is so outsized in its stupidity and cruelty that it’s hard to distend it into a “funny” caricature, even a bleak one. In Trump’s second term, it has only gotten bleaker; jokes that were worn out by the end of 2020 are getting retold with a nasty vengeance, and the bar for cathartic laughter has been raised considerably.Satire at its finest: South Park takes on Trump’s martial takeover, AI and tech brosRead moreFor a comedy fan, this winds up translating to an aversion. The occasional shots taken by The Simpsons somehow don’t land as squarely as they did when aimed at presidents I liked much, much more. I watchSaturday Night Liveevery week, and mostly dread James Austin Johnson’s accurate but ultimately defangedimpression. (Some weeks, Johnson himself seems bummed out to be doing it.) I respect the hell out of Stephen Colbert, but I have never sought out his Trump commentary; I don’t need any more clapter – the reaction encouraged by comedy that wants your approval more than your laughter – in my life. South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone seemed to agree; Parker’s 2017 announcement that they’d grown bored of taking shots at Trump – then barely into his first presidential term – was one of the show’smany controversiesover the years.So how is it that South Park’s revived anti-Trump blows this season have managed to land? A big part of it is precisely Stone and Parker’s allergy to clapter and the grandstanding that inspires it. They obviously resent anything they read as putting on airs and sometimes in the past, this came across as its own form of preachiness, with “everybody chill”-style speeches at an episode’s end that would secretly sound just as prescriptive as the self-righteousness they wanted to send up. With their most recent Trump parody, though, there isn’t much moralizing – just gratifyingly mean caricatures of deserving figures such as Trump,JD Vanceand homeland security secretaryKristi Noem. Some (not all) of their past roastings have verged on point-and-laugh bullying; here are targets worthy of that derision.Some of this derision speaks through the language of South Park itself. Trump isn’t vocally or visually imitated; he’s depicted in a series of repurposed photos, with the same voice and animation technique that Parker and Stone used to bring Saddam Hussein to life in the South Park movie. He’s also given the same sexual partner: amuscled-up and put-upon version of Satan, who has found himself in another toxic relationship. Calling Trump a wannabe dictator doesn’t break new ground, but there’s something satisfying in Stone and Parker using their personal toolkit to draw a line between Trump and Hussein; if they thought it was a histrionic comparison, they’d be making fun of it instead of making it. Similarly, there’s real spite animating the depiction of Noem as adog-murderingzealot whose glamorous face needs to be repeatedly lacquered and reaffixed to her head as she commands an army of Immigration and Customs Enforcement thugs.Lewd, crude and politically astute: South Park’s history of controversyRead moreNot all of the season’s satire has involved making real-life figures regulars on the show. Because South Park’s ensemble has rarely felt as vast or believably developed as Springfield of The Simpsons (or even Arlen on King of the Hill), it’s also flexible enough to turn Randy, Stan’s desperately trend-following dad, into a ketamine-microdosing, tech-bro moron addicted to the soothing, empty reassurances of ChatGPT – the focus ofthe most recent episode, to the point where most of the core child cast doesn’t appear. Surprisingly, this season has deployed forever favorite Cartman more sparingly so far, again getting self-referential in the season’s second episode, where the id-driven and arguably evil little kid is incensed to find out that podcasters have stolen his “shtick” – his pervasive hatefulness, repackaged as a challenge to debate where the aggressor is always the self-appointed winner. Ascribing this “master debater” title to Cartman (alongside a fellow kid serving as an obvious Charlie Kirk/Ben Shapiro stand-in) somehow manages to make this ridiculous behavior funny in its petty smallness without glorifying it.A South Park diehard would probably describe this praise as a fair-weather fan only enjoying the show when it goes after the “right” targets. Maybe that’s true, but it’s also a lot easier to take some joy in savaging Vance as a meme-faced version of a Fantasy Island sidekick than, say, accusing George Lucas and Steven Spielberg of cultural rape. It’s probably wishful thinking to wonder if Parker and Stone might actually move the needle of the perception on tech bros, debate-me podcasters and Trump-world ghouls, especially among the dude demo. But it’s also just a blessed change of pace to see say-anything, first-amendment types finding a fresher target than the wokeness bogeyman. While countless standups continue to whine about being silenced, Parker and Stone seem highly aware of their rarified position (and, asParamountcontractors, alsoawareof what actual political-corporateinterferencelooks like). In a world where Trump’s actual political opponents seem terrified to actually fight him, some well-deserved, point-and-laugh meanness has become a surprising novelty.Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkAnimation on TVTV comedyComedyTelevisionUS televisionDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

I could sense that the train was approaching our destination, so shuffled down the berth, easing up the blind to find a ruby necklace of brake lights running parallel with the tracks.It had rained overnight and the road was slick, the sky a midnight blue, a D-shaped moon fading in the corner. Dawn was minutes away, and I could just make out the jumble of houses on hills, lights flicking on as though fireflies lay between their folds.I stepped into the corridor as the train curved around a lake that gleamed like a pool of pink metal as first light fell upon its surface. Around me, passengers were now zipping up bags, brushing their teeth and locking berths into place, pausing to look out of the windows as a pair of minarets rose into view like sharpened pencils. Istanbul’s skyline was coming into focus.View image in fullscreenThe writer and family on the Santa Claus Express in Finland.Photograph: Monisha RajeshFive days earlier, I’d set off from London St Pancras hoping to retrace the original route of the Orient Express via Paris, Vienna and Bucharest, with the final leg passing through Sofia. Journeying 2,450 miles by rail, I now felt a deep satisfaction as the doors banged open and the sound of the second call to prayer greeted me on the platform. But I felt something else too: a rekindling of my love affair with night trains.It all began in 2010, when I spent four monthsriding around on the trains of Indian Railways. At first the rail network represented little more than a mode of transport, a means to an end. But I soon realised that the trains possessed spirit and personality, each a character in its own right. As much as I enjoyed journeys by day – hot chai in one hand, fresh samosa in the other – and constant commotion around me, I relished the nights. It was after dark when I would find peace in the cool of the open doorway, talking to hawkers and ticket inspectors, making notes on the day gone by. As others slept, life beyond the carriage continued and I stayed awake to bear witness to it: a pack of pye-dogs being fed down an alley; bored drivers playing cards on car bonnets; the twentysomething winking at me from the back of her boyfriend’s moped as they careered towards the beach. Each moment felt like a gift, and while I hadn’t realised it at the time, I was already immersed in slow travel.I found passengers who travelled solely for the thrill of the night train: groups of colleagues, young families, honeymooning couplesThree years ago, I made that jaunt from London to Istanbul, which involved three sleeper services: a shabby old Nightjet from Paris to Vienna; the surprisingly smart Dacia from Vienna to Bucharest; and the severely delayed Sofia-Istanbul Express. Three extraordinary journeys with wildly differing compartments, companions and scenery. Still, the madness of sharing with strangers, drinking whisky at 10am and trying to sleep to trance music was enough to spark an adventure that would take me from Palermo to Peru as I documented the resurgence in night trains.View image in fullscreenNice-Ville station.Photograph: Peter Cavanagh/AlamyOnly a decade before, such journeys were fizzling out in Europe, the rise of budget airlines and high-speed rail leading to a cull of sleeper services. But who knew the world was going to shut down? After lockdown, rail travel began making its way back on to travellers’ radars. With climate change undeniable, people were keen to control their carbon footprints by exploring closer to home. Private companies, such as the Belgian–Dutch co-operative European Sleeper, popped up with plans to launch new sleepers across Europe, and existing operators – including Sweden’s Snälltåget and Austria’s Nightjet – wanted to extend routes, encouraged by campaign groups such asBack-on-TrackandOui au train de Nuit!.With a bucket list of trains in hand, some of which were yet to start running, I set off to discover whether sleeper trains still held an allure – and who was using them. It didn’t take long to find out as I swept up the wintry backbone of Sweden on the Norrland night train to Narvik, surrounded by a cohort of school teachers from Stockholm on a skiing weekend to Kiruna in Swedish Lapland. In the din of a neon-lit dining car they offered me creamed cod’s roe on crispbread while explaining where I could chase the northern lights. They told me they regularly used the sleeper for weekends away, in both summer and winter, preferring the overnight ride to frantic queues at the airport – and the fraught disposal of liquids, they added, shaking bottles of wine in my face.View image in fullscreenThe Brussels to Berlin sleeper passing through the Netherlands.Photograph: ANP/AlamyDuring the period of the midnight sun in Norway, I met Ludwig, a chief mate for the coastguard who commuted all the way to Tromsø at the northern tip of the country in a refusal to contribute to climate change. He had travelled the route more than 20 times and recounted his encounters with elderly women and happy drunks who shared their moonshine, presenting him with cured deer hearts in return for companionship. And on the Santa Claus Express in Finland, I tucked into smoky reindeer stew with my children, surrendering to the journey’s festive charms as snow fell around us, the train sweeping quietly up the country to the depths of Finnish Lapland, where the sun never rose and the howl of huskies carried across the treetops.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Carriages were sometimes too hot or too cold, blankets too thin, pillows too flat, and companions just too damn loud. I’d sometimes wake with a headache, dreading the border crossings where I’d have to haul my bags or sleep with my passport in hand to make checks faster and more efficient. But all was forgiven during those moments of pure magic, when I’d nudge up the blind, eager to see where we were. Would the sun be firing streaks into the sky? Would the moon be hanging on? I’d sit in my blanket, coffee in hand, watching as farmers fed their flocks and children caught my eye from bedroom windows, a friendly wave never failing to make my day.View image in fullscreenIn Istanbul ‘I looked out of the window as a pair of minarets rose into view like sharpened pencils.’Photograph: Mauritius Images/AlamyEven when we were delayed, no one seemed to mind – my fellow passengers shrugging, pottering around and enjoying the extra time to read, chat or snooze. Becausetimewas what these night trains were giving us. Time to reconnect with friends as we moved through the darkness, with nothing but our own reflections in the window to distract us as we drifted into a state of confession, or opened up to family as though locked in a therapist’s room for the night. I had time for myself too, time to slow down and shut off, watching as the world whipped by my window and my thoughts calmed to a kind of meditation.Since I began my journeys, new routes have opened, old routes have returned and the feeling is one of hope that night trains will stand the test of time. I don’t know what the future holds for them, but I know that when I board a night train and shift up to the window as we set off beneath the moonlight, it feels like coming home.Monisha Rajesh’s new book, Moonlight Express: Around the World by Night Train (Bloomsbury, £22), is published 28 August.

Today’s one is flecked with courgettes (zucchini), toasted seeds, a pleasing hint of green chilli and plenty of cheddar – the more mature, the better. It is delicious in the extreme, and even more so when spread with pickled chilli butter. But first a year-round roast chicken, inspired by the red rices of Mexico, that fills the day with a happy glow. If ever there was a dish to sing for its supper …Roast chicken stuffed with tomato rice and smoky oregano butter (pictured top)I am endlessly in awe of the amount of umami unleashed by a simple braise of tomatoes, garlic and onion. Here, their sticky, sweet juices caramelise around the grains of rice and edges of the pan, producing a swashbuckling flavour-bomb that looks resplendent when it comes to the table.Prep15 minCook1 hr 30 minServes6–8250glong-grain rice1 large chicken(about 2kg)40gbutter1–2tbsp olive oil1 large onion, peeled and roughly choppedSea salt and black pepper1 thumb-sized piecefresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped50gsun-dried tomato paste1tbsp chipotle en adobo1tsp ground allspice260gcherry tomatoes, quartered, or a 400g tin500mlchicken stock, or water200mlwhite wineFor the butter1 fat garlic clove, peeled½tsp ground allspice1tsp sea salt1 handfulfresh oregano leaves, or thyme, roughly chopped1tbsp chipotle en adobo75groom-temperature butterSoak the rice in a bowl of cold water for 10 minutes and take the chicken out of the fridge so it comes up to room temperature.Put a casserole dish or large saucepan on a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add the butter and olive oil. Stir in the onion, season generously and sweat, stirring, for about 10 minutes.Add the ginger and garlic, cook, stirring, for three to four minutes more, then stir in the sun-dried tomato paste, chipotle and allspice. Stir in the tomatoes, then drain the rice and add that, too. Stir for a few minutes to coat the rice, then pour in the stock or water and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer, cook for 15 minutes, then take off the heat. By this time, the tomatoes will have started to break down and will be smelling fragrant and delicious, but the rice will not yet be fully cooked; you’ll finish it off in the oven later.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Meanwhile, make the butter: in a mortar or small blender, grind the garlic, allspice, salt and herbs to a paste, then work in the chipotle and butter until well combined.Put the chicken in a roasting tray and loosen the skin around the breast and thighs. Push two-thirds of the chipotle butter under the skin, then smear the rest all over the outside of the chicken. Stuff the bird with the part-cooked red rice, and scoop any that doesn’t fit inside bird into the roasting tray under the chicken. Pour in the wine, then roast for an hour and 15 minutes (allow 15 minutes per 500g of bird, plus 15 minutes, and you should be spot on), until the chicken is golden and the juices run clear when the thickest part of the thighs are pierced with a skewer. I usually cut between the thighs and body after 35 minutes, to allow the insides of the thighs to cook without risk of overcooking the breast. The chicken will emerge resplendent with that smoky tomato rice. Carve and serve.Courgette soda bread with pickled chilli butterView image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ courgette soda bread with pickled chilli butter.Alongside the roast chicken, this loaf, with additional cheese and a sprightly green salad, makes a stunning weekend lunch. It is also great slathered with cold salted butter and nothing else.Prep10 minCook1 hr 30 minMakes1 loaf250gcourgettes200gwhite spelt flour, plus extra for dusting130gwhite rye, wholemeal or emmer flour2tsp sea salt2tsp bicarbonate of soda100gmixed seeds, such as sunflower and pumpkin1½tsp fennel seeds120gmature cheddar, grated2 green chillies, finely diced300mlbuttermilkFor the butter250gsoftened butter3–4 large pickled chillies40gfresh dill, leaves picked2tsp sea saltFreshly ground black pepperBlitz all the ingredients for the butter in a small food processor until fully combined, then roll into a sausage, wrap in baking paper and chill until needed. It will keep happily for several weeks in the refrigerator.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 and put a baking sheet inside to heat up. Have ready a sheet of baking paper.Roughly grate the courgettes into a bowl, then squeeze them tightly with your hands to get rid of any excess liquid. Squeeze again in paper kitchen towels to extract every last bit of moisture, then set aside.Sift the flours, salt and bicarbonate of soda into a large bowl, then tip anything left in the sieve into the bowl.Put a frying pan on a medium heat and, once hot, gently toast the mixed seeds for five to six minutes, until they start to crackle and pop. Reserve a few tablespoons’ worth, then tip the rest into the flour bowl. Toast the fennel seeds in the same pan for a minute, then add to the flour. Tip in the squeezed courgettes, cheddar and chillies, and fold until they are all nicely coated in the flour.Make a well in the centre of the courgette mix, then pour in the buttermilk and, as quickly and deftly as you can, fold it in; the quicker you can do this, the lighter the soda bread will be. This is quite a sticky dough, so do not lose faith. Turn out on to a floured surface and, with flour-dusted hands, shape the dough into a round with authority and speed. Make a cross on the top with a sharp knife and sprinkle with the reserved toasted mixed seeds.Take the baking sheet out of the oven and line it with the reserved sheet of baking paper. Put the soda bread on top and bake for 40–45 minutes, until golden and hollow-sounding when you tap the base. Serve with the chilli butter. Wrapped and stored in a bread bin, the loaf will keep for several days.These recipes are edited extracts from Mexican Table by Thomasina Miers (Quadrille, £28).

That’s why there’s always a glut of fresh produce in the kitchen, both hers and mine – like mother, like daughter. At this time of year, that means courgettes, and the usual way I dispatch them is in ashaak(dry curry) or a pilau. Today’s dish is a combination of the two: spiced fried courgettes, just shy of melted, tossed through rice with fresh herbs and served with a fancy salted pistachio yoghurt masquerading as a raita.Courgette and mint pilau with salted pistachio yoghurtPrep15 minCook55 minServes4For the rice300g basmati riceOlive oil2 red onions, peeled and sliced into very thin half-moonsFine sea salt750g courgettes, cut into thin half-moons4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced1 tsp ground coriander1 tsp ground cumin450ml vegetable stock20g fresh mint, leaves pickedFor the yoghurt40g shelled pistachios, very finely chopped30g fresh coriander, very finely chopped2green fingerchillies, stalks discarded, the rest very finely chopped½ tsp agave syrup½ tsp fine sea salt2 tbsp lemon juice200ggreek yoghurtPut the rice in a bowl, cover with cold water, then squish with your hands to wash the rice until the water goes cloudy. Drain the rice and repeat three to five times, until the water runs clear, then cover with fresh cold water and put to one side.To cook the onions, heat four tablespoons of oil in a wide saute pan. When it’s hot, add the sliced onions and a teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, for eight to 10 minutes, until soft and browning. Add the courgettes and cook, stirring every now and then, for 15 minutes. Stir in the garlic, coriander and cumin, cook for a couple of minutes, until the raw garlic smell has gone, then take off the heat and leave to cool.Drain the rice, put it in a medium saucepan for which you have a tight-fitting lid, then pour over the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Once it’s boiling, turn down the heat to a whisper, cover and leave to cook for 10 minutes. Take off the heat and set aside, lid still on, for another 10 minutes.To make the pistachio yoghurt, in a small bowl mix the pistachios, coriander, chillies, agave syrup, salt and lemon juice with four tablespoons of olive oil. In a second small bowl, mix the yoghurt with a big pinch of salt, then thin with up to 50ml water until it’s the texture of double cream. Stir well, then top with the pistachio mixture.Tip the courgette mix on to the hot rice, tear in most of the mint leaves and fold in until well combined. Transfer to a platter, top with the remaining mint and serve with the salted pistachio yoghurt alongside.Explore more on these topicsRiceMeera Sodha recipesVegetablesFoodMain courseSide dishesVegetarian food and drinkNuts and seedsrecipesShareReuse this content"

Many of the cheaper olives I tasted have a strong, wine-vinegar acidity that I don’t really enjoy straight from the jar. I do, however, appreciate that punch when they’re paired with other ingredients: sliced on pizza, tossed into salads or, my favourite, skewered with an anchovy and a pickled guindilla pepper to make that classic Basquepintxo, the gilda. Salty olives are also brilliant for seasoning dishes such as tagines or in a tapenade crust for roast chicken – just remember to seasonafterthey’ve imparted their salty flavour.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

The test group were all completely different, ranging from ones with rich olive oil and woody herb tones and a great meaty texture to others with strong acidic tones balanced by sweet apple notes.
