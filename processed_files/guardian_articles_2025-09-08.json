I can address that from the backbenchesLouise Haigh is Labour MP for Sheffield HeeleyMon 8 Sep 2025 16.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 8 Sep 2025 17.06 EDTShareThe events of the past week have been heart-wrenching for the labour movement.Angela Rayneris not just a friend, she is a trailblazer: proof that whatever your start in life, you can rise to the very top through hard work, grit and a government that is willing to fight on the side of working people. She has been an inspiration to so many and a true force of nature. Our party and our government will be poorer without her around the cabinet table.I am deeply grateful for the encouragement I have received from party members, colleagues and friends in recent days about the deputy leadership. To be considered a possible successor to Rayner is truly humbling.That said, I will not be standing.Several senior female Labour MPs drop out of party deputy leader contentionRead moreLabour was elected in 2024 to rebuild Britain – not simply to steady the ship, but to remake it completely. We need strong voices pushing for that renewal: on the economy, on workers’ rights and on the climate crisis. For me, that means remaining on the backbenches, where I can speak plainly and campaign boldly.While theprime minister’s reshufflehas been described as a political reset, Britain now needs something even more urgent – an economic reset. The Conservatives left behind a sluggish economy and debt that was not being repaid by revenue raised byworld-class infrastructure and public services. However, the problem isn’t just the level of debt – it’s the framework we’ve inherited for managing it.In 2010, David Cameron established theOffice for Budget Responsibility(OBR) to analyse the public finances and judge whether the government was meeting its self-imposed targets for debt and deficits. However, its short-term analysis fails to account for the long-term benefits of radical policy changes such as public investment in programmes such as Sure Start. Unless we break free from these rules, Labour will struggle to deliver the transformation people voted for last year.George Osborne’s issuing of a high number ofinflation-linked gilts(more expensive to pay back than conventional gilts with a fixed interest rate when inflation is high) and policy of quantitative easing and subsequent unwinding of that policy now cost the country billions each year. Separately, we continue to subsidise commercial banksto the tune of £40bnannually through interest on reserves – a policy other institutions such as the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank do not pursue – even as vital services remain underfunded.This is not sustainable. Nor is it democratic. If unelected institutions such as the OBR dictate the limits of government ambition and the financial sector continues to drain public funds, we risk betraying the people and communities who put their trust in us last year.Labour was elected to renew Britain and that means breaking free of rules designed to limit ambition and instead building an economy that serves democracy, not the other way around.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would seem, upon reading, near impossible to adapt into a film. Or, at least, a film worthy of O’Farrell’s so finely woven sensory spell. Film-makerChloé Zhaohas attempted to do so anyway, and the result is a stately, occasionally lugubrious drama whose closing minutes are among the most poignant in recent memory.Zhao is a good fit for the material. She, too, is a close observer of nature and of the many aching, yearning people passing through it. But she has previously not made anything as traditionally tailored and refined as this. The humbler dimensions of her filmsThe RiderandNomadlandare missed here; Hamnet too often gives off the effortful hum of prestige awards-bait.Hedda review – Ibsen gets a Saltburn makeover in Amazon’s ill-advised rompRead moreBut Zhao’s hallmark compassion and curiosity remain, qualities necessary to Hamnet, which could easily tilt into the realm of manipulative tearjerkers. Hamnet was, records tell us, Shakespeare’s son, who died at a young age and is thought to have inspired, at the very least, the title of Hamlet, the story of a young prince who meets a tragic end. What O’Farrell and now Zhao imagine is that the writing of Hamlet was an exercise in grieving, a way for Shakespeare to honor his son and bid him adieu.It’s a persuasive idea, even if it takes some literary contortions to really buy into it. While Zhao sometimes strains to sell the notion – a scene in which a weeping Shakespeare stands on the banks of the Thames and speaks a snippet of the “to be or not to be” soliloquy is perhaps a bit over-egged – she has mostly convinced us by the end. Or, at least, Hamnet has justified the bold speculation, using a leapt-to conclusion to illuminate a fundamental aspect of living. Ultimately, what does it really matter if it actually happened this way?Hamnet invents many other facets of Shakespeare’s history. It dreams up the courtship of young William (Paul Mescal), then a Latin tutor, and slightly older Agnes Hathaway (Jessie Buckley), an oddball loner about whom the villagers whisper in fearful tones. William is drawn to exactly that strangeness, the individuality that will come to inform so much of the family’s domestic routine. Zhao spends a fair amount of time on these early days, maybe too much. Some of it could be better spent on the years in which Hamnet (Jacobi Jupe) occupied the house alongside his twin, Judith (Olivia Lynes), and their older sister, Susanna (Bodhi Rae Breathnach). One longs to truly know Hamnet before he is so wrenchingly lost to the world, to feel the agony of his absence that much more acutely.Whatever Zhao doesn’t supply, though, is mostly made up for by the richly felt performances of the film’s two leads. Mescal is able to be far more expressive than he’s been allowed in quieter films such asAftersunandThe History of Sound. It is a pleasure to see the full breadth of his range, from seductive to shattered. It’s Buckley, though, who wholly envelops the film, giving staggering breath and body to Hamnet’s portrait of loss. She is nothing short of a wonder. (She also recorded a new version of the audiobook and does a terrific job at that.) It is on her shoulders that the film’s knockout climax rests. As she rises to the task, it is as if she is no longer acting but instead channeling a whole history of human lamentation.Sacrifice review – starry satire pokes fun at celebrity before falling into a volcanoRead moreThat may all sound rather grandiose. But the final five minutes of Hamnet really are that striking. So much much so that one can totally forgive the use of composer Max Richter’s On the Nature of Daylight, already used to embody grief over a child so effectively in the filmArrival. In these final moments, Zhao finally makes clear the whole purpose of the film. It has not been merely to show us a prettily shot sad thing, as the film can too often seem. It has, it turns out, been building toward a grand meditation on art’s great capacity. We watch in awe as something so personal to Agnes and her husband becomes, in a transformative instant, universal. It is the power of creation made manifest, a private sorrow blossoming into one of the most enduring works of art the world has ever known.This sublime finale does not completely absolve the film of all of its problems. There is still its lopsided storytelling, still the persistent feeling that this is all strong-arming us into doleful submission, still the ever so slightly cloying quality of Agnes’s woodsy mysticism. But that Zhao manages even a few minutes of such transcendent catharsis may tip Hamnet into greatness anyway. In that closing, as Agnes both reaches for and says goodbye to the son who slipped away, the tears flow naturally, they need no effortful wringing out. It proves a lovely experience, to sob in a movie theater alongside strangers, mourning for Agnes and William’s loss and for our own, amazed and relieved that a faraway, unknowable person has made something to connect us all.Hamnet is screening at theToronto film festivaland will be released in the US on 27 November, in the UK on 9 January and in Australia on 15 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewToronto film festivalChloé ZhaoPaul MescalJessie BuckleyFestivalsWilliam ShakespearereviewsShareReuse this content"

What crisis? Starmer has a delivery plan – so chill outJohn CraceThe prime minister’s new chief secretary has been out and about trying to calm the storm after Angela Rayner’s exitMon 8 Sep 2025 13.16 EDTLast modified on Mon 8 Sep 2025 16.04 EDTShareDon’t Panic! Don’t Panic! Over the weekend the newly promotedDarren Jones, Keir Starmer’s very own Keir Starmer tribute act, was out and about on the airwaves trying to convince everyone – himself included – that the government was not in crisis.What do you mean, chaos, he said time and again as the questions kept on coming. Each time sounding slightly more chippy. He’s not a man who takes kindly to even a hint of mockery. Darren takes Darren extremely seriously.It was perfectly normal for Angela Rayner – the housing secretary, deputy prime minister and deputy leader of theLabourparty rolled into one – to be forced to resign after failing to pay the correct stamp duty. The kind of thing that could happen at any time to any cabinet minister. Hell, the Tories did that the whole time.Darren even had Rayner’s exit pencilled into his government spreadsheet. A deputy leadership election was just what Labour and the country wanted. It would be great for all the candidates to make the case for how well things had gone over the past year.It was perfectly normal for Starmer to have conducted an extensive reshuffle after just over a year in office. One that was basically an admission that most of the cabinet had been given the wrong jobs first time round. That half the cabinet had been fairly hopeless but needed to be given another chance in a different department because all the other MPs would be even worse. Besides, they would all be more of a liability to the government mouthing off their resentments from the backbenches.So, everything was about as great as it could possibly be. Hell, Labour had been given a five-year term, so it was perfectly OK to waste the first 12 months by getting things wrong. No one expected the government to hit the ground running. Everyone should just chill out a bit.Keir now had the women and men in place that he had really always wanted. And if the Labour government had tilted a bit to the right, then so be it. After all, it wasn’t as if there was any significant threat to Labour from the left, was there?All was for the best in the best of all possible worlds. We should be more grateful to the government for what it was doing, rather than complaining from the sidelines. If people didn’t have something supportive to say, then they should just keep quiet. Stop moaning about things they don’t understand. Keir had a plan for delivery. And what he was planning to deliver was no less than delivery itself. You should applaud the burning sense of mission. Not try to understand it.Fair to say that not everyone was onboard with the new reality. Not even all Labour MPs were trying to pretend everything was hunky dory. Previously loyally silent backbenchers were now becoming more vocal about the government’s direction.So it was no surprise on Monday that Stella Creasy used an urgent question to highlight the 800 people who had been arrested for protesting about the government’s decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation. Surely the police had better things to do with their time than locking up peaceful vicars, retired grandmothers and hospital consultants?Ideally it should have been the new home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, to reply for the government. But she was away at the Five Eyes conference damning her predecessor with faint praise: Yvette Cooper had done an OK job, she supposed, as far as she had gone. Which wasn’t nearly far enough.It was left to the security minister, Dan Jarvis, to take her place. Dan is a decent bod. There isn’t anyone on either side of the house who dislikes him. He always does his best to try to do the right thing and be nice to everyone. But he’s not the sharpest and if he has a fault, it’s that he’s always too willing to believe what his superiors tell him. Which, as far as Labour are concerned, makes him an ideal person to be junior minister. He can be trusted to repeat the party line for as long as it takes. He knows that thinking for himself is well above his pay grade.It was like this, said Dan. No matter that the Ministry of Defence had at first declared the damage Palestine Action had caused to planes as vandalism. Dan had now been informed that they were an extremely dangerous terrorist organisation. Worse than al-Qaida. Worse than Islamic State.The country was on the very brink of collapse. And it was pure ageism to suggest that because so many old people had been on the march that they weren’t a danger to the fabric of society. Geriatrics were the most lethal of all terrorists. Because they had so much less to lose than the young, old people would happily blow themselves – and us – up without a second thought. Nobody should ever trust a pensioner ever again. Using their triple-locked payments to fund extremism.“The country should trust the government,” said Dan. It knew what it was doing. The people understood. Except they didn’t. Not even the Commons was in agreement. Just about the only person fully behind Desperate Dan was the synaptically challenged Chris Philp, who would happily lock up his own family if he thought there were votes in it.Almost everyone else, Labour, Tory and Lib Dems, were minded to think the government had made a bad call. Conservative Julian Lewis put it best. Palestine Action supporters were almost certainly violent and criminal. But that didn’t make them terrorists as well.That just left Richard Tice. The Reform deputy leader wasn’t bothered about any niceties. All this nitpicking about the definition of terrorism was pure woke-ism. As far as he was concerned we should be locking up anyone who was even loosely associated with Palestine Action. If all these pensioners with too much time on their hand hadn’t done anything wrong yet, it was only a matter of time before they did.At which point you wondered why Dicky had never called for Lucy Connolly, the darling of last weekend’s Reform conference, to be re-arrested. Surely calling for migrants to be burned alive must fit his definition of terrorism.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchLabourKeir StarmerDarren JonescommentShareReuse this content"

Megan Thee Stallion’s Mamushi is bumping from a speaker, and on a large screen, two white circles roam up and down an outline of my body.Am I at an exclusive German sex club at 2am?Sadly, no. I am in a suburban shopping complex on a Tuesday afternoon, getting a massage from an Aescape robot.Aescapedescribesitself as a “pioneering lifestyle robotics company” that is “revolutionizing the wellness industry by introducing exceptional massage experiences”. Put simply, they make robot masseuses: cushioned tables with two large, white, robotic arms that rub your body based on your preferences and preselected programs.I love massages – I am never happier than when the profane flesh sack I call my body is being kneaded likeWagyu beef. So I opt for a 30-minute “Power Up”, which costs $60 and promises to leave me feeling “invigorated and alert”.According to theMayo Clinic Health System, massage therapy can help with a number of conditions including anxiety, depression, sports injuries, digestive disorders, headaches and soft tissue sprains. It can also improve circulation, strengthen the body’s immune response, lower stress levels and increase energy.But is a massage from a machine as good as a massage from a person?What is lymphatic drainage massage and why do celebrities love it?Read more“There are so many contraptions out there. My mom has a massage chair and I use a Theragun at home,” says Crista de la Garza, a board-certified massage therapist in Colorado. While there can be value in these tools, De la Garza says she is not worried about a robot coming for her job.First, there are real physical benefits to being touched by a person. During the early pandemic, for example, when people were isolating and social distancing, many reported feeling “skin hunger” – a sense of deprivation and abandonment that comes from not getting enough physical touch.A 2024 paper in the journalNaturesaid that receiving touch was “of critical importance” and found that touch interventions helped reduce pain and feelings of depression and anxiety in adults. The paper also found that touch interventions from objects or robots “resulted in similar physical benefits, but lower mental health benefits”.“It is a powerful thing to be touched safely and appropriately and therapeutically,” says De la Garza.In fairness, Aescape’swebsitesays it “is not about replacing therapists”. Instead, “it’s about enhancing their work and addressing the industry’s labor shortage.”View image in fullscreenA robot masseuse made by Aescape.Photograph: Courtesy of Aescape“Nothing can replace a human,” the efficient, blond receptionist tells me when I arrive for my appointment. I’m late because of parking woes, but the machine doesn’t care. It’s a regular spa, with manicures, pedicures, human massages and crystals for sale at the front desk. On our way to the robot’s chamber, she says the Aescape has been popular, especially with clients who “aren’t comfortable being touched by a stranger”, she says.Inside, she hands me a high-compression, Aescape-branded top and leggings towearduring my treatment. Apparently, they help enhance the machine’s “body detection”. I lie down on the table and hold very still while the Aescape scans my body.

What kind of music would I like to listen to? Lo-fi ambient jazz, classic rock or a playlist called “brat”? I can view an unsettlingly detailed outline of my body – they didn’t need to depict my saddle bags so clearly – or soothing videos of the ocean, a snowy mountain or a rainy forest. I can adjust the height of my headrest and change the pressure of the machine.One of the things that makes De la Garza skeptical about robot massage is that it “makes you think too much”. Getting massaged by a person involves more surrender – the therapist controls most of the experience, she says, and the client can turn off their brain: “The client’s job is to breathe, communicate as needed, and simply be in a relaxed state.”Indeed, I find myself distracted by the urge to tweak the music and scenery. Do I like looking at snow? It’s OK. Can I relax to the “brat” playlist? No – back to ambient lo-fi. Is that really what my butt looks like? Chilling.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Some friends said a machine massage would make them nervous. What if the powerful robotic arms skewered my soft flesh like a pile of antipasti? I, on the other hand, was more worried it wouldn’t be strong enough, and that my knots of tension would remain coiled and tight.But the massage is enjoyable. The robot’s blunt, plastic hands are gently warmed. They can’t knead and poke as precisely as human fingertips, but their ministrations feel pleasant. Actually, the hands are more like knobs, roughly the size and shape of small Dutch clogs. It feels a little like someone pressing their fist into your back.At the end of my session, I feel looser and more relaxed than I had at the beginning. I don’t feel invigorated, exactly, but I do think I could drop into a deep, dreamless sleep.It is certainly no substitute for a real massage. I like the surrender and precision of a normal massage, and the Aescape can’t massage the head, hands or feet. But if I can see myself going again if I feel particularly sore after a workout, or if I find myself roaming around a suburban shopping center with 30 minutes to kill. It’s relatively cheap, and you don’t have to tip.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealth & wellbeingRobotsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s why we must make our voices heardMon 8 Sep 2025 14.32 EDTLast modified on Mon 8 Sep 2025 14.33 EDTShareIs it ever the right time to worry about what Peter Mandelson has just said? Given he is so famously allied with the darkness, and the government is beset by more urgent problems, everywhere, it feels as if Mandelson should cut us a break and just say inoffensive things, or ideally, nothing. Instead, the ambassador to the US made a speech on Sunday to theDitchley Foundation. Of Donald Trump, he said: “The president may not follow the traditional rulebook or conventional practice, but he is a risk taker in a world where a ‘business as usual’ approach no longer works.” According to Mandelson, those of us arguing for a pivot away from the special relationship are guilty of “lazy thinking”.Some things are so depressing that they make themselves urgent, just by resting their boot upon your spirit. “Traditional rulebook or conventional practice” – I guess, by that, Mandelson means the traditional rule of law, where you don’t deport people without due process, to countries they weren’t even born in, ordetain four-year-olds in the middle of cancer treatment. Or maybe he means the “conventional practice” of thinking genocide is bad; we live in a world where that belief has apparently been overturned, replaced by an AI mock-up of what Gaza would look like cleansed of its remaining inhabitants.Mandelson is only the most cynical and supercilious edge of aLabourapproach that is impossible to make sense of. They want to deplore misogyny and authoritarianism and yet go fishing with JD Vance. They want to support Ukraine to the hilt and yet pull out the stops for Trump’s state visit – to which he could easily show up with Vladimir Putin as his plus-one. He’s a daredevil, remember; an iconoclast, a risk taker. Stop bleating about the international order and how important it is not to reward wars of aggression, stupid liberal. Try to keep up.There is no appealing to the conscience of a government that has already told you it can’t afford a conscience when there’s cheap nuclear energy on the table. And yet, as unjust as it is, from a global perspective, Mandelson’s position on Trump represents all of our position. Unless you find some way to express dissent, the state invitation comes from the British people. The government’s prioritisation of slightly more favourable tariffs over decency and human rights reflects our priorities.I have wondered so often what the point of a protest demo was. I’ve seen marches that were vast and made no difference at all, and demos that made a difference, but so long after, or so circuitously, that the world never recognised the connection. I went through a phase, some time between the poll tax riots and the Countryside Alliance, of thinking that demonstrations didn’t deserve to succeed – why should you get to decide what tax we pay, who we go to war against, what animals you’re allowed to chase on a horse, just because you showed up? It’s a little bit primitive, for a mature democracy.TheStop Trump demoon 17 September cannot conceivably stop Trump. It cannot stop him in the US, it cannot stop him on the world stage, it cannot even stop the state visit, given that he’ll already have arrived. It cannot shame the prime minister, the US ambassador, the outgoing or the incoming foreign secretary, or if it does, there will be no way of knowing. But it will succeed for everyone on it, because they’ll have withheld their consent for a morally bankrupt position. It will succeed in a way that shouting at the radio cannot, being collective rather than solitary. It will succeed because a state visit from Trump that went unprotested would be the most abject and painful failure of British values. We cannot conjure ourselves a government that responds with decency to the US administration.

Khalil is no stranger to political persecution, but not even Trump’s crackdown can silence himOliver Laughlandin New YorkMon 8 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 8 Sep 2025 17.39 EDTShareView image in fullscreen‘Who I am has been skewed so much’ … Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, who was released from Ice detention in June, in New York, August 2025.Photograph: Ahmed Gaber/The GuardianWhen a history of resistance to thelurching authoritarianismofDonald Trump’s second presidency is written, it could well begin on 11 April 2025, inside a small immigration courtroom in remote, central Louisiana.It was there, in the early afternoon, that a slight young man dressed in a blue uniform jumpsuit spoke calmly but directly to the new administration – away from the gaze of television cameras and 1,000 miles (1,610km) from his friends and family. Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate and Palestinian organiser, had been arrested a month earlier – snatched from the lobby of his Manhattan apartment building as he returned home with his wife. Now, detained in the small town of Jena, he sat before a judgewho had just ruledthat he was eligible to be deported from the United States purely for his political views.Khalil asked for permission to speak. He paused for a moment, before sharply rebuking the jurist who continued to hold his fate in her hands by throwing her own words back at her. He reminded her that she had guaranteed that the court would ensure him “due process” and “fundamental fairness”.“Neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process,” he told her, in effect branding the venue a kangaroo court. “This is exactly why theTrump administrationhas sent me to this court, 1,000 miles away from my family.”This administration is trying to do everything in its power – and beyond its power – to punish me and deport meI was one of a handful of journalists in Jena that day. It was a period of particular distress in the US, his arrest being the first of a spate of high-profile detentions of students seized off the streets by immigration agents over their political views. In that moment of fear, when somany were going silent, I was taken aback by the quiet courage that seemed to come so naturally to Khalil even as formal political opposition to Trump’s iron fist had largely faltered.Four months on, and now bailed from detention and back in New York, I ask Khalil where it had come from and whether he would define it as an act of bravery.“No. I have always believed in standing up against injustice,” he says in his gentle voice. “I knew that it was predetermined. That it was a play. It was theatre. I did not want to play within their rules.”On a bright summer’s day in Brooklyn, Khalil invites me to his new apartment that commands a towering view over the borough’s low-rises. The walls are freshly painted white – he had moved in just a few weeks earlier – and we sit on a grey sofa by the window. His four-month-old son, Deen, is crying softly in the next room as Noor Abdalla, his wife, soothes him.It is an archetypal scene of a young New York family: a baby rocker sits beside a large TV, white tulips lean against a ceramic vase, bright artwork adorns the walls. Khalil is warm and candid, he offers me chocolate and water before we start talking. But the grim reality of his situation soon lingers as we dial an attorney from his legal team who listens in to our three-hour conversation as a precaution.Although he is free from detention, the Trump administration’s case against him is still winding through the courts. While he is a legal permanent resident, he acknowledges deportation could still be the ultimate outcome.View image in fullscreen‘Even if I am deported, I would continue to speak out for Palestine’ … Khalil in his Brooklyn apartment in August.Photograph: Ahmed Gaber/The Guardian“This administration is trying to do everything in its power – and beyond its power, in fact – to punish me and deport me,” he says. “Up until very recently, they were trying torearrestme.”He is working on contingency plans for if and when that happens, he acknowledges, without describing specifics. For now, he has attempted to return to a degree of normality. He spends his days with baby Deen, learning to be a father after he missed the birth while detained. He recently rode the subway for the first time since his release, but still finds himself looking over his shoulder. The move to Brooklyn was partly to create distance from Columbia’s campus and all the past wounds of its recent history. But still, it remains difficult to focus.A Palestinian refugee, intimately familiar with the experience of repeated displacement, he remains resolute in the face of a prospective fresh exile.“Even if I am deported, I would continue to speak out for Palestine,” he says.Khalil’s life was changed forever when agents in plainclothes came to his old apartment back in March. His arrest,captured on video by Abdalla, marked a turning point as Trump ramped up his era of mass deportations and began a censorship campaign against the campuses that saw large protests of Israel’s war in Gaza. Khalil remained calm as he was placed in handcuffs and driven away, with his wife – heavily pregnant – left on the sidewalk, desperately calling their lawyer.I wonder if he has ever watched the video back?He shakes his head.In a time where you know that injustices are happening around you, staying silent is complicity“It is a moment I would never want to remember,” he says. “It was one of the most difficult, scariest moments in my life. I do not want to watch a moment where I was helpless to support Noor.”His overwhelming memory of that night is his fear that Abdalla, a US citizen, might also face arrest. He repeated her phone number in his head so as not to forget it. But he also remembers making “chill” small talk with the arresting agents as he was driven away. They spoke about theiftardinner, the breaking-fast meal taken during Ramadan, he had just eaten.“I did not fear them whatsoever,” he recalls. “I saw them eye to eye.”Shortly after the arrest, he overheard an incoming phone call from the White House, requesting an update. He was then presented with a document that accused him of no crime, but argued his presence in the US compromised foreign policy interests. (A memo signed by US secretary of state Marco Rubio,disclosed later, argued this was due to participation in “antisemitic protests and disruptive activities”.)He read it and laughed in disbelief.“Are they really going this far in coming after me?” he thought.After 36 hours of travel under guard, he ended up in Jena, the sprawling centre four hours from New Orleans, hidden away in a pine forest by a country road. It isknownas one of the harshest immigration jails in the US. Inside his large detention dormitory, the TV was blaring and he saw Trump ata press conference on the White House lawn perusing Teslas with Elon Musk.The president was asked about Khalil’s arrest.“We ought to get him the hell out of the country,” Trump replied.It was at this point he started to realise the enormity of it all – a public narrative about him spiralling out of his control, laundered through a vast rightwing disinformation infrastructure branding him an antisemite and terrorism supporter.“Who I am has been skewed so much,” he recalls thinking. “I was like: ‘Damn my future is basically done … my reputation, my career aspirations.’”But through the horror, he says he knew his record would ultimately speak for itself. “That was my salvation,” he says. “I was 100% confident I had a very clean history. They would be able to get no dirt on me.”He spoke to Abdalla by phone. She was safe. She told him about an outpouring of support across the world. He sighed with relief.That quiet courage, which Khalil has carried throughout this ordeal, has been forged since childhood, at the multiple junctures he was forced to upend his life.He was born in a small Palestinian refugee camp namedKhan Eshiehon the outskirts of Damascus, the youngest of four brothers. His paternal grandparents were displaced from their farmland outside of Tiberias, in what is now Israel, duringthe Nakbaof 1948. His father was a welder who left school at the age of 10. His mother, a low-level civil servant, ended her education at 16.His Palestinian identity was omnipresent growing up; most of his neighbours were displaced from the same region as his grandparents. And his grandmother, who was illiterate, would tell stories of her life in Palestine, always with a view to eventual return.View image in fullscreenAfter the couple moved away from Columbia’s campus, Noor Abdalla, Khalil’s wife, says the new apartment is their ‘safe space’.Photograph: Ahmed Gaber/The Guardian“You could see the struggle in her face,” he says.His parents, both largely apolitical, instilled in him the values of a formal education and he excelled, graduating with aspirations to become a commercial pilot. But the forces of history had other plans. The final few years of his schooling in Syria coincided with the pro-democracy movements that swept across the region during the Arab spring. One of his first forays into formal activism came on 15 May 2011, as part ofa series of “Nakba Day” demonstrations at Israel’s borders. At least a dozen protesters were killed during the clashes with Israeli forces. Dozens more were injured.Khalil was one of them. Aged 16, he was shot in the leg and spent a number of days in hospital. “That was the first real encounter of violence, direct violence, byIsraelagainst me,” he says.What shocked me, when I was kidnapped [by US immigration], was just how reminiscent that was to cases I witnessed in SyriaThe experience propelled him further into the tumultuous politics of the era – initially heady and full of promise before quickly deteriorating into state brutality and civil war. He witnessed the crackdowns of the Assad regime on close friends and family who helped provide shelter to Syrians fleeing Damascus. Khalil became involved in organising smaller acts of resistance: street protests, spray painting and posting anti-Assad comments on social media.“These things were the very minimum we could do,” he says. “In a time where you know that injustices are happening around you, staying silent is complicity. Pure complicity.”It all intensified after graduating high school. He had been set to study aerospace engineering at the University of Aleppo, but the city was burning as the civil war raged. On 11 January 2013, a week after he turned 18, two of his childhood friends and co-organisers named Bashar and Ali were snatched off the street by Syrian intelligence officers. He feared he would be next.The same night he made plans to flee, crossing the border into Lebanon the next day. “I left everything behind,” he says. “I fled without a plan. My biggest worry was that they would confess the names of the people around them. And you wouldn’t blame them to confess under such torture by the regime.”Bashar and Ali were murdered after their arrest, their deaths confirmed only a few months ago after the Assad regime collapsed at the end of 2024.Khalil recognises the different shades of authoritarianism he has faced throughout his life.“What shocked me at the very beginning, when I was kidnapped [by US immigration], was just how reminiscent that was to cases I witnessed in Syria,” he says. “You would have plainclothed officers without any warrant come and take you just because of your political speech.”View image in fullscreenKhalil leads a pro-Palestinian march in New York in August 2025.Photograph: Stephanie Keith/Getty ImagesKhalil languished in Jena for more than 100 days. He had known little about the US’s deportation machine, and the detention center’s reputationas a legal black hole, until he experienced it all.He slept in a large dorm room lined with bunkbeds, holding about 70 men. He spent time dictatingwell-written dispatchesover the phone to his legal team. He read literature: Out of Place, the autobiography of the Palestinian academic Edward Said; Man’s Search for Meaning, the psychologist Viktor Frankl’s memoir of surviving the Holocaust. But mostly he shared stories with the other men detained with him. Many had been picked up during routine check-ins with immigration officials. Others were recently apprehended at the southern border. A few had been detained in Jena for more than a year. The majority of people who pass through immigration court in Jena have no lawyers as mandatory legal representation is not guaranteed.One man, a Georgian national, had been held for about eight months, picked up with his wife in California. Held in separate detention centres about two hours apart, the couple, who were fleeing Georgia’s new pro-Russia government, had not been able to speak to each other since their arrest. The man, a carpenter, spent hours fashioning improvised rosaries from commissary items, including crayon, ground coffee and bread – hardened into beads by heat in a microwave. Khalil shows me a set, still impressed by the ingenuity.Many of the men, Khalil says, have since been removed from the US.For Khalil, the lowest moment came on the night his son was born. His requests for a furlough to attend the birth were denied and so he was forced to listen on the phone in the middle of the night, whispering quiet words of encouragement as Abdalla laboured. The line cut around 2am, and by the time he called back he heard his newborn son crying in the background. He whispered the call to prayer down the line to welcome baby Deen into the world.“It was a very difficult moment that I don’t wish anyone to go through,” he says, his eyes drifting. “It was a clear act of cruelty just to punish me.”Abdalla emerges to say hello with Deen in her arms. Khalil’s face lights up. At four months, his son has a full head of hair, deep dimples and expressive brown eyes that follow his father around the room.I ask her how it feels to have her husband back.“Not having him for the first two months of Deen’s life was hard,” she says. “We missed a lot of milestones that you can’t get back. So we are catching up on lost time.”The new apartment is their “safe space”, she says. The couple have been largely welcomed with open arms here, receiving spontaneous acts of kindness: an unexpected free lunch, smiles on the street. I am the first journalist they have invited over.Khalil met his future wife, now a dentist, in Lebanon in 2016, while working for a non-profit helping educate Syrian refugees. She visited on an exchange program. He had worked his way up from nothing after fleeing Syria, taking construction jobs during the day and volunteering for a refugee charity in the evenings, which granted him free room and board in their office. Eventually he attended university to study computer science and took remedial English classes. He gradually let go of his dream to fly commercial jets, becoming more immersed in the work of government and bureaucracy.View image in fullscreen‘We are catching up on lost time’ … Khalil and Abdalla at a rally in Manhattan, New York, in June 2025.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesKhalil and Abdalla bonded over games of backgammon and stayed in touch after she returned home to Flint, Michigan. He was attracted to her kindness and gentle nature. She found his intellect and ambition appealing, and eventually pushed him to apply for a job at the British embassy, where he worked on Syria policy until moving to New York in 2023. Their long-distance relationship lasted seven years.I ask how fatherhood has changed him since he returned home.“It absolutely makes me think [more] about risks,” he acknowledges. “When you have someone depending on you, you want them to have as normal a life as possible. But at the same time it pushes me towards advocacy. When I see Deen I always remember the children who are being killed because of Israel, who don’t have the luxury of being in New York. [I think of] immigrant children who don’t have the luxury of having an American passport that would somehow protect them.”But Palestinian liberation is never far from his imagination.“I want Deen to be able to visit his home town, his ancestors’ town, and live equally with everyone,” he says.View image in fullscreenGifts from friends and supporters.Photograph: Ahmed Gaber/The GuardianThe pro-Gaza protests at Columbia marked the first time Khalil had ever assumed a public-facing role. Having set his sights on a behind-the-scenes job in government bureaucracy, he was instead thrust into a spring of campus tumult in 2024 as students constructed encampments, staged rallies and, in late April, occupied the university’s Hamilton Hall, leading toan overwhelming police response.Khalil served as a negotiator with the university’s administration, presenting students’ demands, including divestment from companies with ties to Israel. He was not present on campus during the Hamilton Hall occupation.The negotiations were protracted but civil. A Columbia administrator,anonymously quoted in the New York Times, later described Khalil as “thoughtful, passionate, and principled, sometimes to the point of rigidity”. It strikes me as apt, but I wonder if he agrees?“Pretty much,” he says, smiling. “I don’t know about rigidity though, because it was notmyposition, it was the students’.”Unlike many of those on the protest frontlines, Khalil did not wear a face mask, leaving him vulnerable to online doxing fromhardline pro-Israel groups, which have supplied the Trump administration with lists of candidates for deportation.Liberation doesn’t mean throwing anyone out. Liberation means liberating everyone, whether the oppressed or the oppressors“I have never worn a mask during a protest because I knew that the purpose of doxing was to intimidate us, to silence us,” he says. But the campaign ramped up again after the election of Trump, shortly before Khalil’s arrest. He had not foreseen how dangerous it might become.The allegations of antisemitism have never been substantiated with hard evidence. Khalil says Jewish students played an “integral” role in organising the campus protests and argues it is Israel and the Trump administration’s policies that fuel global antisemitism through their policies.So how does he visualise a free Palestine?“I imagine it as a place where everyone lives in dignity, freedom, equality, regardless of who they are, where they come from,” he says. “I don’t think there’s an alternative to that, to have a lasting and just peace in the Middle East.“Liberation doesn’t mean throwing anyone out. Liberation means liberating everyone, whether the oppressed or the oppressors.”Khalil remains scathing of Columbia’s response to the protests and itslater capitulation to the Trump administration’s demands it suppress pro-Palestinian protest. Yet he expresses an honest sadness that he was unable to walk the stage to collect his master’s degree in May this year. He is the first in his family to graduate from university. His parents had planned to travel from Germany, where they now live, to witness it. He had bought his gown a year in advance.“I know it would have been an incredibly important moment for my parents, who have fought and sacrificed so much for me to get to this point,” he says. Instead, he received the accolade as an emailed PDF file.View image in fullscreenA demonstrator at the encampment established in support of Gaza waves the Palestinian flag at Columbia University in April 2024 in Manhattan, New York.Photograph: Alex Kent/Getty ImagesIt was late June when Khalil emerged from Jena on a sweltering humid afternoon. He raised his fist in the air to celebrate and walked towards a small group of journalists. He had lost about 15lbs (6.8kg). A federal judge in New Jersey had just ordered his release, having found the Trump administration’s foreign policy argument was likely unconstitutional.Relief and a raised fist as Mahmoud Khalil goes free – but release ‘very long overdue’Read moreIhad asked him that dayto respond in his own words to the “threat” label that Trump had branded him with. “Trump and his administration, they chose the wrong person for this,” he told me.I had not fully comprehended what he meant by “the wrong person” at the time. But as our conversation comes to a close, it becomes clear. The adversity that Khalil has faced – from displacement to detention – in such a short span of life has only fuelled his sense of mission. He will not be forced into submission or silence. He views his past and future as inextricable from the wider Palestinian struggle stretching from 1948 to the current slaughter inGaza. “It is a drop in the sea of Palestinian sorrow and grief, where families are being erased, children are being killed, houses being raided and dignity is eroded,” he says.He takes a moment before we wrap up, seemingly a little exhausted.“My story is just a small story,” he says. “A story of how violence against Palestinians can be transported around the world.”"

They shine a spotlight on the inner workings of a publicly subsidised company Johnson established after leaving Downing Street in September 2022.The trove reveals how Johnson has used the company to manage an array of highly paid jobs and business ventures. They raise questions for the former Conservative leader about whether he has breached “revolving door” rules governing post-ministerial careers.The revelations have echoes of the Greensill Capital lobbying scandal that embroiled one of Johnson’s predecessors, David Cameron. They may also spark questions about the taxpayer-funded allowance that former prime ministers get to run their private offices.What are the Boris Files and what do they reveal about former PM’s conduct?Read moreThere are more than 1,800 files in the cache, including some that date back to Johnson’s tenure in Downing Street. The Guardian is the only UK media organisation known to have viewed the trove.The files reveal:Johnsonlobbied a senior Saudi official he had met while in office, asking him to share a pitch with the petrostate’s autocratic crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, for a firm he co-chairs.The ex-PMreceived more than £200,000 from a hedge fund after meeting Venezuela’s presidentNicolás Maduro – contrary to statements he was not paid.While in office,Johnson appears to have held a secret meeting with Peter Thiel, the billionaire who founded the controversial US data firm Palantir, months before it was given a role managing NHS data.In an apparent breach of Covid pandemic rules,Johnson hosted a dinner for a Tory peer who financed a lavish refurbishment of his Downing Street flat, a day after the second national Covid-19 lockdown came into force.Johnson did not respond to multiple requests for comment.The files were obtained byDistributed Denial of Secrets(DDoS), a US-registered non-profit that archives leaked and hacked documents.DDoS told the Guardian it did not know the provenance of the leak. However, the appearance of the data on its servers will raise inevitable questions about a breach of security at the former prime minister’s office.The trove mostly postdates Johnson’s term as prime minister, covering a period between September 2022 and July 2024, although it also contains some documents produced when he was in Downing Street.Disclosures about how Johnson has forged a lucrative career in the private sector throw into sharp relief a little-known scheme that allows former UK prime ministers to claim government money to pay for expenses “arising from their special position in public life”.The annual six-figure payment, known as the public duty costs allowance (PDCA), is a subsidy intended to support an ex-PM’s public duties. It is not meant to be used for private or commercial activities.The files raise questions about whether Johnson has blurred these lines while running the Office of Boris Johnson, a limited company established a month after he left Downing Street.A senior Cabinet Office source confirmed that Johnson has claimed funds under the scheme to pay for staff salaries in his private office. Official data shows he has claimed £182,000 in PDCA payments since leaving government.Johnson’s office, the leak reveals, has played a central role in managing his commercial endeavours. These include deals with Daily Mail and GB News, and a globe-trotting career giving speeches for deep-pocketed clients.The cache of files suggest that between October 2022 and May 2024, Johnson was paid approximately £5.1m for 34 speeches. The engagements typically earn him hundreds of thousands of pounds, as well as generous expenses to cover first-class flights and stays in five-star hotels for him and his staff.It is not unusual or against any rules for former prime ministers to travel the world delivering paid speeches, but there are restrictions on business activities they can undertake after leaving government.These include prohibitions on lobbying contacts developed while in office in foreign governments and commercial organisations. Johnson was reminded of these rules by an official watchdog on the day he left Downing Street.Revelations from the Boris Files will place pressure on Johnson to explain how some of his recent contacts with foreign governments on behalf of commercial interest fall within the rules.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

They raise questions about whether he breached lobbying restrictions imposed on former ministers.Johnson’s overtures to the most powerful figures inSaudi Arabiawere for Better Earth, a little-known UK-based consultancy firm established by a Canadian mining financier, who co-chairs the company with the ex-PM.The approaches included a lunch and meeting in a private members’ club with an influential Saudi minister whom Johnson had met while in government, files suggest.Johnson also personally wrote a flattering letter addressed to Prince Mohammed, telling the de facto Saudi leader he was a “fervent admirer of the vision you have for the kingdom”.The letter is contained in the Boris Files, acache of leaked documentsthat shine a light on Johnson’s post-prime ministerial career. The files were obtained byDistributed Denial of Secrets, a US non-profit that archives data leaks.The cache offers an inside view of how Johnson has forged a lucrative career in the private sector after leaving government, using his influence and contacts made while in public office.Johnson and Better Earth did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The Saudi government also did not respond.Better Earth’s shareholders include seven close associates and advisers to Johnson, including two ex-Conservative ministers and Charlotte Owen, a 32-year-old former aidegiven a peerageby the ex-PM.As prime minister and, earlier in his career, foreign secretary, Johnson engaged extensively with the government of Saudi Arabia, an authoritarian state that rights groups have long criticised for human rights abuses.View image in fullscreenBoris Johnson and Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh in March 2022.Photograph: Getty ImagesJohnson met Prince Mohammed on a visit to Riyadh in 2022 and held a series of official calls with the royal while in Downing Street. The pair were reported to have frequently exchanged WhatsApp messages.In his letter addressed to the crown prince last year, Johnson wrote: “I would very much like to explore whether [Better Earth] could be useful to you and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in achieving your ambitions – because I believe it certainly could.”Offer of employmentBetter Earth was founded by a Canadian businessman, Amir Adnani, in late 2023. How Johnson first became involved with Adnani, who runs a multibillion-dollar uranium mining company and hasappearedon the former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s podcast, remains unclear.The Observerreported last yearthat a senior executive at Adnani’s US-based mining group met Johnson while prime minister in May 2022. Adnaniposted on social mediathat Johnson and the executive discussed nuclear power and uranium.Less than two years later, Adnani established Better Earth and hired Johnson, who had resigned as prime minister 15 months earlier, to serve as co-chair of the company, a part-time role for which he would receive £120,000 a year as well as an initial 12.5% stake in the business, files suggest.The offer of employment was signed in late January 2024, a day after Johnson visited Riyadh, where he gave a speech and appears to have attended a dinner hosted by the UK’s ambassador.According to the files, Johnson agreed to begin working for the company on 1 February. Days later, he completed an application form for the watchdog that monitors and approves post-government jobs, telling the body that he planned to start working for the firm in March.“I was approached with an offer to be part of this new venture,” Johnson wrote in the application to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba). He said he would “represent the company at meetings with potential clients and investors”.The form did not mention that Johnson had by then already agreed to work for the company.When Acoba approved the role in April 2024, the watchdog imposed conditions, stating that for two years after leaving office Johnson “should not become personally involved in lobbying contacts you developed during your time in office in other governments” to secure business or investment for Better Earth.However, Johnson had by then already had lunch with the Saudi minister of commerce, Majid al-Qasabi, whom he had earlier met in his capacity as prime minister, during which the new venture was discussed, files suggest.View image in fullscreenBoris Johnson and Majid al-Qasabi in Riyadh in March 2022.Photograph: Andrew Parsons/No 10 Downing StreetJohnson met Qasabi on numerous occasions when in government. At least one meeting occurred at Downing Street, and documents seen by the Guardian suggest Qasabi oversaw Johnson’s trip as prime minister to the kingdom in March 2022. Official photos of the visit show Johnson on an evening tour of Riyadh’s streets with Qasabi walking at his side.‘Friend’ in trunksLeaked files suggest that after the February 2024 lunch with Qasabi, Better Earth planned for Johnson to send a letter to Prince Mohammed with the minister’s support. In an apparent reference to Qasabi, the company’s CEO wrote: “We have taken all the advice Majid has given us.”Johnson appears to have then drafted formal letters to Qasabi and Prince Mohammed later in February 2024. They were prepared with an “Office of Boris Johnson” letterhead. It is unclear when or if they were ultimately sent.View image in fullscreenBoris Johnson and Mohammed bin Salman in March 2022.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/APWriting to the crown prince, Johnson referred to meeting Qasabi years earlier, recalling that his “friend” was “wearing a pair of floral swimming trunks … because we were both diving off the coast of what was then a trackless desert”.Johnson continued: “Although I now live a life of blameless rustic obscurity in Oxfordshire, I remain deeply committed to carbon reduction.” He noted that he had “helped run the highly successful” Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in 2021.“I now chair a company that offers practical solutions for developing green energy and reducing carbon,” he wrote, explaining that he was “sending a more detailed note” about the company to Qasabi. “But it would of course be a great honour to come to see you and to explain in person.”‘Keen to advise and assist’According to a draft of the accompanying letter to Qasabi, Johnson said Better Earth was “keen to advise and assist” Saudi Arabia on preparing carbon reduction commitments for the UN’s Cop30 climate summit later this year.He wrote that Better Earth was “not just an adviser but a project developer”. He said the company “would be honoured to send our team of experts” to the kingdom to evaluate opportunities to partner on developing “net zero geothermal electricity generation” projects.“We would very much like to meet with the appropriate ministerial authorities,” Johnson said. “Our hope is to help [the crown prince] to achieve his ambitions.”It is not clear if Qasabi passed on details of Johnson’s pitch to Prince Mohammed or how exactly the Saudi government, which is a close UK ally, responded to the overtures. However, Qasabi appears to have met the ex-PM several months later, in mid-June 2024.Quick GuideContact Henry Dyer about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Henry using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The list suggests Better Earth was on the meeting’s agenda.As well as Johnson and Qasabi, Adnani, the ex-PM’s Canadian business partner, planned to attend alongside Chris Skidmore and Nigel Adams, two former Tory ministers who hold shares in Better Earth.Explore more on these topicsBoris JohnsonThe Boris FilesLobbyingConservativesMohammed bin SalmanSaudi ArabianewsShareReuse this content"

The files contain a contract with Merlyn Advisors signed by Johnson months earlier in September 2023.The contract, drawn up by Merlyn, notes that Johnson “over a long career has acquired a unique experience and knowledge of domestic UK government politics and international relations”.It says Merlyn Advisors “interacts with a number of different domestic and international stakeholders which would benefit from the perspectives and the experiences of” Johnson. For each meeting, Johnson was to be paid a fee of £200,000 – worth up to £1.6m a year for eight meetings.The contract was to last two years from October 2023. The company would also pay £35,000 a month to support a thinktank that Johnson was considering setting up in the UK.Johnson did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Petermann said: “I have no comment. Please don’t try to put words in my mouth as to whether or not I dispute it.”The Guardian has not confirmed whether the payment made to Johnson was for his visit to Venezuela.The cache does not include a copy of the contract also signed by the company and it is possible it was abandoned after UK officials asked questions about the arrangement.However, a log of payments suggests that an invoice, which mirrors the contract, was sent by Johnson’s office to Petermann weeks after the meeting with Maduro, an authoritarian president whose government isunder investigationby international criminal court prosecutors for alleged crimes against humanity.View image in fullscreenNicolás Maduro during a press conference in Caracas this month.Photograph: Jesús Vargas/Getty ImagesThe invoice, for £200,000 plus an additional £40,000, was sent on 15 March 2024, weeks after the meeting with Maduro. This invoice was paid on 7 May, the document suggests. There are no details of other invoices to Merlyn.The files were obtained byDistributed Denial of Secrets, a US non-profit that archives data leaks. The Guardian is the first media outlet to publish stories based on the leak.Johnson has said he was “extensively briefed” by the top UK diplomat in Caracas before the meeting and updated the embassy afterwards.However, the £240,000 payment raises questions about the true nature of the trip and Johnson’s claims to have acted as a diplomatic backchannel for the UK to open a dialogue with Maduro.The Sunday Timeshas reported that Johnson did not tell Cameron about Petermann’s involvement in the meeting.Cameron, who was embroiled in his own post-Downing Street scandal, might have warned Johnson of the perils of using the privileges of his role as a former PM for financial gain. As prime minister, Johnson had launched an official investigation into Cameron’s lobbying for Greensill Capital.Questions about candourJohnson faced questions from UK government officials about the Venezuela meeting after a series of reports in early March last year from the Sunday Times and the Financial Times revealing Petermann’s involvement and Johnson’s relationship with the company. But details of the contract and an invoice sent to the company have not previously been reported.The media reports drew the attention of officials at the Whitehall revolving-door watchdog responsible for monitoring the post-government careers of ex-ministers, the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba).They wrote to Johnson on 18 March 2024. What seemed confusing to the officials was that Johnson had made an application months earlier, in September 2023. What they had not known – and what is revealed in the leaked files – is that the contract prepared by the hedge fund had been signed by Johnson.At the time, Johnson faced a potential difficulty: he had told Acoba that “no publicity or announcement whatsoever is planned in relation to this role”, but if approval was given by Acoba, his work for the hedge fund would be revealed to the public in a letter published by the watchdog.Johnson now faces fresh questions about his candour with the watchdog. He told Acoba he had had no meetings with the hedge fund in his last two years in office.View image in fullscreenMaarten Petermann.Photograph: L’ÉquipeIn fact, Johnson had a meeting with Petermann when he was still in office, just over a week before the end of his time as prime minister, leaked documents show.The leaked files reveal they met for a two-and-a-half-hour lunch at Chequers, Johnson’s grace-and-favour country house, on 28 August 2022. Petermann attended alongside a fellow trustee at an animal conservation charity that had hired Johnson’s soon-to-be wife, Carrie, more than a year earlier in January 2021.The lunch with Petermann has not been previously reported and was never disclosed in official transparency registers. The secret lunch raises questions over whether Johnson used his final days as prime minister, and the luxuries of that office, to develop a relationship with a future business interest.Fourteen months after the Chequers lunch, Johnson told Acoba officials in October 2023 that he had decided not to take up a role with the hedge fund. This came only days after he had signed the contract prepared by Merlyn Advisors. One possibility is that the contract was shelved at the 11th hour after Acoba’s inquiries.For a fortnight in late March 2024, Acoba repeatedly sought clarification from Johnson about his role with the company. He repeatedly denied having a contractual relationship with the company or having been paid for any meetings in Venezuela. He refused to say in what capacity he had met Maduro, or to characterise his relationship with the company.The then chair of Acoba, the Conservative peer Eric Pickles, would later characterise Johnson’s responses as “evasive” and lacking candour. Lord Pickles concluded there remained “a reasonable concern” Johnson was acting for the company in “a capacity that would be considered advisory work” and had breached the rules by failing to properly answer Acoba’s questions.Just over a fortnight later, the £240,000 invoice would be marked by Johnson’s staff as paid.Quick GuideContact Henry Dyer about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Henry using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

They raise further questions about Johnson’s integrity during his turbulent three years in office.View image in fullscreenDavid Brownlow.Photograph: dbcf.comA log of Johnson’s meeting with Brownlow is contained in acache of filesfrom his private office seen by the Guardian. The leak was obtained byDistributed Denial of Secrets, a US non-profit that archives data leaks.Johnson quit as prime minister in July 2022 as Tory MPs turned on him after a series of self-inflicted scandals including the Partygate affair, which resulted in him being fined by the Metropolitan police for breaking lockdown rules.He then stood down as a Conservative MP in June 2023 after an investigation into the Partygate scandal found he had misled parliament and recommended a lengthy suspension from the House of Commons.In a further potential breach, the files also suggest that on Saturday 20 June 2020, the day after the surprise birthday party in the cabinet room that led to his police fine, Johnson and his then fiancee, Carrie Symonds, now his wife, hosted three guests for a “private appointment” at Downing Street.A close friend of Carrie’s who specialises in “vibrational” music treatments; the friend’s mother, a fellow natural medicine practitioner; and the journalist Alex Wickham were welcomed in the “flat/garden”, according to a record of the prime minister’s activities that day.Social gatherings indoors were still forbidden in June 2020. At the time, Johnson’s Downing Street denied reports he had celebrated his birthday with family friends in the flat on the evening of 19 June, claiming he had hosted them outside.A log of Johnson’s activities the following day, however, indicates the rules may have been broken then. In addition, an entry for 19 June suggests he and Carrie paid a visit to one of her family members who lived in south-west London.View image in fullscreenBoris and Carrie Johnson in September 2022.Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty ImagesThe previous week, Johnson had asked the public during a Downing Street press conference to “continue to show restraint and respect the rules which are designed to keep us all safe”.In another possible breach, a heavily pregnant Carrie hosted her close friend Nimco Ali overnight at Chequers, the prime minister’s official country house, on the same day that Johnson announced the first lockdown in March 2020.“From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction – you must stay at home,” he said in his national address on 23 March. “Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households … You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no.”The leaked files also appear to confirm reports that Johnson hosted a baby shower for his fiancee at Chequers at the start of the pandemic, despite having warned two days earlier that many families would lose loved ones in the “worst public health crisis for a generation”.Carrie invited more than a dozen close friends, including three Conservative government aides, to Chequers in Buckinghamshire for the lunch and afternoon tea party on Saturday 14 March 2020, six weeks before the birth of their son.View image in fullscreenBoris Johnson addresses a news conference on Covid on 18 March 2020.Photograph: Eddie Mulholland/AFP/Getty ImagesJust two days later, Johnson told the public that they should stop non-essential contact with other people and all unnecessary travel. Pregnant women were among those he said should be particularly careful.When reports of the baby shower first emerged in June that year, Downing Street refused to comment. But a file in the leaked data logging his activities appears to confirm for the first time that the gathering did take place.The confirmation will rekindle speculation that Johnson may have delayed announcing the more stringent advice by several days to avoid having to cancel the baby shower.Johnson, his wife, Wickham, Ali, and Brownlow did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsBoris JohnsonThe Boris FilesCarrie JohnsonCoronavirusConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

Johnson is now likely to face questions about whether the non-disclosure amounts to a breach of the ministerial code.The hour-long afternoon meeting on 28 August 2019 was marked “private” in a log of Johnson’s activities that day and was not subsequently disclosed on the government’s public log of meetings.It took place in Downing Street on the day Johnson had informed the queen he was proroguing parliament in an effort to push through his Brexit plans, triggering a huge backlash.The secrecy around Johnson’s encounter with Thiel raises serious questions about how transparent the government’s public log of meetings has been in recent years.It is unclear why officials did not disclose the meeting between the prime minister, his senior adviser and a tech mogul around the time Thiel’s company was seeking lucrative business with the UK government.Johnson and Thiel did not respond to repeated requests for comment.The existence of the meeting is revealed in an official government document contained in the Boris Files, acache of leaked documents. The files have been seen by the Guardian after they were obtained by the transparency groupDistributed Denial of Secrets.Meetings carried out in an official ministerial capacity have to be disclosed on the public government log but may be exempt if they are considered political relating to party business, or personal with a friend or family.Thiel is not a donor to the Conservative party and as an American would not be able to give money to UK politics.That raises questions about the grounds for which the meeting with Thiel was held on a “private” basis, and whether the failure to disclose the meeting could amount to a breach of the transparency requirements outlined in the ministerial code issued by Johnson himself.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Peter Thiel in December 2016.Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesThiel helped fund Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and has accused the NHS of making people sick as well as claiming the UK has “Stockholm syndrome” when it comes to its affection for the health service. He is soon to embark on afour-part lecture seriesabout the “theology, history, literature and politics of the antichrist”.Boris Johnson faces ‘serious questions’ over new business with uranium entrepreneurRead moreThiel co-foundedPalantir, which has origins in the CIA, and he remains a significant shareholder. Palantir has grown to have a huge role within the UK health system since 2020, having worked on Ministry of Defence contracts since 2014.During the pandemic, Palantir worked for £1 on managing data to help with the NHS’s pandemic response. It was given follow-on contracts worth about £60m and is now embedded in the system, having apparently proved its worth to NHS digital chiefs.In 2023, it then landed the biggest IT contract ever awarded by the NHS,for a £330m federated data platformto analyse hospital data and patient information.Palantir’s presence in the health system has raised concerns among privacy campaigners, although the NHS insists the government retains ownership of all data. A spokesperson for Palantir defended the company at the time, saying data privacy and security were “always paramount in all of our work”, from supporting the Covid vaccine rollout to waiting list reductions and developing software to help speed up cancer diagnosis.Palantir has also come in for criticism in recent months over itssupply of technologyto the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and tohelp Trump’s mass deportation efforts.Keir Starmer toured Palantir’s Washington office in February with its co-founder and chief executive, Alex Karp.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

I want the freedom to fight for an economic resetPeter WalkerandPippa CrerarMon 8 Sep 2025 16.50 EDTFirst published on Mon 8 Sep 2025 14.46 EDTShareA series of senior female Labour MPs have dropped out of contention to replace Angela Rayner as the party’s deputy leader, as acompressed timetablefor nominations and worries about a potentially toxic atmosphere narrowed the field.Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, is expected to enter the race, where she would be seen as a de facto Downing Street choice, potentially pitting her against Emily Thornberry, who would position herself as a voice for backbenchers.In a fast-moving process where hopefuls have until Thursday afternoon to secure nominations from at least 80LabourMPs, four women tipped as possible frontrunners have already removed themselves from contention.Shabana Mahmood said she wanted to focus on her new job as home secretary, which began on Friday after Rayner’sresignationas deputy prime minister and housing secretary over the underpayment of stamp duty on a second home.“I’m the home secretary, so that is my job, and my top priority is securing our borders,” Mahmood told Sky News in a pooled interview. “I will not be running for deputy leader of the Labour party.”Lou Haigh, the former transport secretary, had been expected to run as a candidate from the left.But, writing in the Guardian, she said she had decided it would be better for her to campaign for a new and more ambitious approach by the government from the backbenches.Jess Phillips, the safeguarding minister, and Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, are also not standing.While the reasons varied, at least one of the potential candidates cited worries about the pressure, as well as a possibly abrasive contest, and worries of a potential repeat of the scrutiny Rayner faced over her family and personal life.Bell Ribiero-Addy, a south London MP who is close to Diane Abbott, is running as the candidate of the Labour left. Thornberry, the former shadow attorney general who was removed by Keir Starmer as Labour entered government, is widely expected to run and has already been gauging possible support among MPs.Thornberry, who now chairs the Commons foreign affairs select committee, would be seen as an experienced and independent voice, and popular with members. However, she faces the hurdle that as with Starmer and David Lammy, the new deputy prime minister – a role separate to the Labour deputy leadership – she is a lawyer with a London constituency.Phillipson, in contrast, represents a Sunderland seat and, like Rayner, grew up in a working-class family, although her cabinet role would bring accusations that she would not be able to properly represent the views of backbench MPs.Another minister tipped to possibly run, who would also be seen as acceptable to Downing Street, is Alison McGovern, the former employment minister, who was moved to the housing and communities department inFriday’s reshuffleprompted by Rayner’s exit.Even if the contest progresses smoothly, it is another unwelcome distraction for Starmer and his team after the chaos of Rayner’s departure and the reshuffle, the latest in a series of reverses for the government.The PM was seeking to reassure Labour MPs on Monday evening, addressing a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party in parliament.Other mooted contenders cited include Lucy Powell, who was removed as Commons leader in the reshuffle, as well as Stella Creasy, Sarah Owen,Anneliese Dodds, Dawn Butler and Meg Hillier, and figures from the left of the party including Richard Burgon and Nadia Whittome.Burgon has not said if he wants to run but, speaking at the TUC conference in Brighton on Monday before Ribiero-Addy’s announcement, hesaidthere needed to be a candidate from the party’s left.Any hopefuls will need to move quickly under the timetable set out by Labour’s national executive committee on Monday. MP nominations will open on Tuesday and potential candidates will have until 5pm on Thursday to gather 80 nominations, which is at least 20% of the parliamentary party.Those who reach this threshold must also receive nominations from at least 5% of constituency Labour parties, or about 30 in total, or at least three official party-affiliated bodies, of which at least two must be unions.The process for this second stage of nominations will run from 13-27 September, with the electronic ballot of party members – who must have been in the party for at least six months from Monday – taking place from 8-23 October. The result will be announced on 25 October.One Downing Street insider said Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s influential chief of staff, hoped to “flood the zone” with contenders so that very few candidates ended up making it over the 80 threshold, limiting the choice presented to party members.Rayner served as deputy PM, but the party deputy leadership is separate to any government role and is voted on by members rather than decided by the PM.While deputy party leaders almost always hold senior cabinet or shadow cabinet posts, a government source confirmed there was no rule saying this had to be the case, meaning the winner of the contest would not necessarily be made a minister if not one already.Explore more on these topicsLabourShabana MahmoodJess PhillipsLisa NandyEmily ThornberryBridget PhillipsonnewsShareReuse this content"

His office said he would make the decision “in the coming days”.Bayrou was toppled when 364 deputies voted that they had no confidence in the government. Just 194 gave him their confidence. Bayrou had called thevotehimself as a last-ditch gamble for support, saying he needed backing from parliament for austerity measures to reduce the public debt.In a speech to parliament before the vote, Bayrou had saidFrancewas under threat from its “inexorable swamp of debt” and must find a “compromise” on a budget. He said if some “minimal” understanding and consensus was not found in the divided parliament then “government action will be destined to fail”.When the leaders of opposition party groups, from the left to the far right, made fiercely critical speeches against him, he said: “I won’t respond to insults” and warned that the image of verbal “violence and contempt” among politicians was damaging democracy.Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally’s parliamentary group told MPs that Bayrou’s departure was “the end of the agony of a phantom government”.Le Pen, who was found guilty in March of theembezzlement of European parliamentary fundsthrough a fake jobs scam and banned from running for office for five years, said Macron must call a parliamentary election immediately, even if it meant she could not run again for her seat in northern France. She has appealed against her conviction and an appeal trial will begin in January.Macron, who stunned the political world by calling asnap parliament electionlast year which resulted in a chamber divided into three blocs – left, centre and far right – has expressed reluctance to call another vote. The far right leads the polls and a new election could result in a similar hung parliament.French deputies – Bayrou confidence motion votePoliticians on the left, which won the most seats in last year’s election, but fell well short of an absolute majority, have said Macron should appoint a prime minister from their camp.During Monday’s debate, Boris Vallaud called Macron “a defeated president” who he held responsible for “impoverishing the poor, enriching the rich and turning his back on the future”.The Socialist MP said Bayrou’s decision to call the vote was not “an act of courage, but a cop-out”.Mathilde Panot of La France Insoumise, a leftwing party, said Bayrou had been “severely beaten”. She added: “He wanted his hour of truth; he got it.”Panot said that as just a third of parliament had given its confidence to Bayrou, Macron’s economic policies had a minority of support and he should also resign. The president, whose term ends in 2027, has always ruled out stepping down.As head of state with authority on foreign policy and national security, Macron directly appoints a prime minister to run domestic affairs. But since last year’s election there has been no absolute majority in the national assembly, creating a form of political deadlock and disagreement on the budget. This means there is no certainty that a new prime minister would be safe from being ousted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Public sector strikes are to follow.The priority for Macron is to appoint a prime minister able to push through a budget for 2026.Bayrou’s unpopular plan for a €44bn (£38bn) budget squeeze and austerity programme to reduce France’s public debt is now certain to be shelved, including his contested proposal to scrap two public holidays. Any new government will return to the drawing board.Bayrou is the second PM to fall since the snap election in June last year – the rightwingMichel Barnier was oustedafter just three months in December. Bayrou had become the most unpopular French prime minister since 1958, largely over his unpopular budget but also his perceived lack of government action.His popularity had also been dented by his stance on anabuse scandal at the Bétharram private Catholic schoolnear his home in south-west France.Bayrou sent several of his children to the school, where his wife also taught catechism. Aparliamentary reportin July found Bayrou failed to act to prevent physical and sexual abuse at the school when he served as education minister between 1993 and 1997.Bayrou was questioned by a parliamentary inquiry about whether he knew about abuse at Bétharram and covered it up. He said he had “hidden nothing”, saying his foes were leading a political campaign of “destruction” against him.His criticisms of the parliamentary inquiry cost him support on Monday night even among his own centrists.The northern politician Violette Spillebout, who co-chaired the parliamentary inquiry, said that despite being a fellow centrist, she abstained in the confidence vote out of anger at Bayrou’s comments on TV this weekend that the parliamentary inquiry was a “political tribune”. She said his comments were an “insult to victims”.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s in line with other large-scale events we’ve put on as a force.”Speaking on the restricted airspace order, he said: “Obviously it’s an offence to fly a drone in a restricted airspace and we will have resources to deal with any of those incursions.“We will have plenty of capability in the sky when the time is appropriate,” he said, adding that the drones will act as an “eye in the sky” during the event.It will be Trump’s second state visit to the UK – an unprecedented gesture towards a US president – after he came in 2019.His first trip to the UK saw thousands of people turn out on the streets in London in opposition.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpForeign policyMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

A minimum of 85 seats are needed for a majority.Just two hours later, with 99% of the vote counted, the result had held, according to state broadcaster NRK.Labour, led by the prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, had clearly emerged as the largest party, but there was also a big swell in support for the rightwing Progress party, which was projected to have doubled in size in the last four years.The Conservative party, meanwhile, had its worst election in 20 years.Støre welcomed the results, playing down any shift to the right. “This is a signal to outsideNorwaythat social democracy can also win despite a right-wing wave,” he told a jubilant crowd of Labour supporters chanting “four more years“.The election was unusually close-fought and polarised, dominated by the cost of living, wealth taxes, oil fund investment in Israel and relations withDonald Trump.On the right, there was a surge in support for the populist Progress party – especially among young men – in what has been described by some as “the Maga-fication” of Norwegian politics.There was also discussion over its leader, Sylvi Listhaug, becoming prime minister in the event of a rightwing victory.But results suggest that Støre, 65, who has been prime minister since 2021, is likely to remain in office, with the former Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg, thought to have provided a significant boost for Labour in recent months, as finance minister.This was despite a campaign that was kicked off by strong criticism over the government’s handling of the Norwegian oil fund’s investment in Israel, which could contribute to complex negotiations with smaller leftwing parties to form a government.Gaute Børstad Skjervø, leader of the AUF, Labour’s youth party, said it was “the comeback of the ages in Norwegian politics”, adding that a year ago the party was “doomed”.“Now Støre has secured re-election. I take my hat off to this turnaround,” he said.The Conservative party leader, Erna Solberg, confirmed their defeat, telling her supporters in Oslo: “We can already state that the Conservative party is embarking on a new term in the Storting as an opposition party.”Solberg, 64, who was already facing calls to resign, said: “It is my responsibility, and I am incredibly sorry for that.”Listhaug, 47, reportedly called Støre to congratulate him on his victory.“It’s fantastic. We’re doing better than what the polls showed. So it’s incredibly good,” she said. Despite not having secured a majority, she said: “We still have reason to feel like winners today.”A record 1.9 million people took part in early voting. By the time polls closed, most of the early votes were reportedly already counted.Despite the rise in support for the Progress party, a centre-left victory leaves Norway an outlier from its Nordic neighbours, Sweden and Finland, which are both led by rightwing governments.Explore more on these topicsNorwayEuropeDonald TrumpThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

It also conserves the media company’s conservative bent; Lachlan Murdoch is regarded as the most conservative of Murdoch’s oldest children.Lachlan is the current chair of News Corp, the parent company of over two dozen publications including the Journal,The Timesand the New York Post, after he succeeded his father in 2023.Rupert Murdoch’s children with his third wife Wendy Deng, Chloe and Grace, will join Lachlan in a new family trust that will hold controlling stakes in Fox Corporation and News Corp, the Murdochs’ media groups. Under the agreement, Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch and James Murdoch will be the beneficiaries of a trust that will house the proceeds of the sale.The three children took their father to court in Reno, Nevada, after he tried to wrest away their voting power and leave Lachlan with sole control of the companies in a project Murdoch reportedly named “Project Family Harmony”.According tocourt records, Murdoch told others in private that while he wanted harmony in the family, he believed Lachlan was the best to lead his media empire into the future.“Would love nothing more than peace all around,” he wrote to his ex-wife Anna, the mother of Elisabeth, Lachlan and James. “But the fact remains Lachlan is the best to run the business — greatly respected inside and outside!”During the legal dispute, Murdoch told his eldest children, according tothe New York Times: “These companies are my legacy. I have put everything into them over my life.” He described his media assets as a “protector of the conservative voice in the English-speaking world” and argued only Lachlan’s leadership could protect them in that role.Family and political differences appear to have driven a wedge between Lachlan and his siblings. James Murdoch has been a vocal critic of the political slant of the family business, particularly onclimate changeand its support of Donald Trump, who iscurrently suingMurdoch’s the Wall Street Journal.In a rare interview earlier published this year, James Murdochtold the Atlanticmagazine that he regarded his father as a “misogynist” and described Fox News as a “menace” to US democracy. According to the article, James and Rupert had barely spoken in years.The family finally agreed on a buyout after the case, which happenedout of public eyefor months, went into appeals, according to theNew York Times.Last December, Nevada commissioner Edmund Gorman concluded that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch had acted in “bad faith” in their attempts to change the terms of an irrevocable trust that divided control of the company between Murdoch’s four oldest children.Gorman’s scathing 96-page opinion accused Murdoch and his eldest son of a “carefully crafted charade” to “permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch’s executive roles”.Lachlan Murdoch is now the de facto heir to one of the world’s most powerful media businesses. As well as Fox News and Fox Sports and the multinational newspaper business, the Murdochs control publisher Harper Collins and the fast-growingTubi, a free streaming service.“News Corp’s board of directors welcomes these developments and believes that the leadership, vision and management by the Company’s Chair, Lachlan Murdoch, will continue to be important to guiding the Company’s strategy and success,” News Corp said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsRupert MurdochWall Street JournalNewspapersUS press and publishingNewspapers & magazinesFox NewsThe TimesnewsShareReuse this content"

Twenty-six others suffered injuries, including six who were left in a serious condition with gunshot wounds.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, visited the site of the attack in Jerusalem with his far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir. “The war continues, in Jerusalem as well,” Netanyahu said.He later repeated calls for people in Gaza City to leave before an upcoming “ground operation” by Israeli forces. “You have been warned – get out of there,” he said.0:45Netanyahu tells Gaza City residents to leave as Israeli forces prepare for ground manoeuvre – videoIsrael Katz, Israel’s defence minister, later posted on X that Gaza would face “a mighty hurricane” if Hamas did not release the last hostages it was holding.The finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said: “This abominable attack will have the most severe and far-reaching consequences.“We will pursue terror everywhere. Just as we crushed Palestinian terror in the Jenin terror camp and the terror camps in northern Samaria – so we will soon do in additional terror camps. Whoever sponsors terror and directs terror will pay the full price.”After the attack, the Israeli military said it was encircling Palestinian villages on the outskirts of the nearby West Bank city of Ramallah.Eyal Zamir, the Israel Defense Forces’ chief of staff, later said in a statement that he “ordered a full closure of the area from which the terrorists came”.“We will continue with a determined and ongoing operational and intelligence effort, we will pursue terror cells everywhere, and we will thwart terrorist infrastructure and its organisers,” he said.A local map showing the location of the deadly bus stop shootingMahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, issued a statement condemning “any targeting of Palestinian and Israeli civilians”.Hamas praised two Palestinian “resistance fighters” who it said had carried out the attack, but stopped short of claiming responsibility. Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant group, also praised the shooting without claiming responsibility.The war in Gaza has sparked a rise in violence in the occupied West Bank and in Israel. Palestinian militants have attacked and killed Israelis, while there has been a steep rise in settler violence against Palestinians.Data from the UN’s humanitarian office says at least 49 Israelis have been killed by Palestinians in Israel or the West Bank between the start of the war and July 2025. In that time, Israeli forces and civilians have killed at least 968 Palestinians in Israel and the West Bank.On Monday evening, Wafa, the official news agency of the Palestinian Authority, said Israeli forces hadkilled a 14-year-old Palestinianduring a raid in Jenin, in the north of the West Bank. There was no immediate confirmation of the report.The attack took place at the Ramot intersection at the northern entrance to Jerusalem in an area occupied by Israel in 1967 and later annexed – a move the UN and most countries do not recognise. The busy intersection was choked by cars and commuters during the rush hour.Images shared on social media appeared to show a Carlo submachine gun discarded at the scene.These weapons can be crudely manufactured in small metal shops, and models produced by gunsmiths in the West Bank have beenused in attacksby Palestinians on Israelis.While there have been scattered attacks in Israel over recent months, the last deadly mass shooting was in October 2024, when two Palestinians from the West Bank opened fire on a major boulevard and light railway station in the Tel Aviv area, killing seven people and leaving many others wounded. Hamas’s military wing claimed responsibility for that attack.France strongly condemned the attack on Monday in a post on social media. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, offered his condolences to the victims and the Israeli people.“The spiral of violence must come to an end. Only a political solution will bring back peace and stability for all in the region,” he said on X.Spain, the EU, Germany and the United Arab Emirates also issued statements of condemnation.Explore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

But health experts cautioned that it was impossible to capture correctly whether any hospital was “good” or “bad” and that the results could prompt patients to avoid seeking help at lower-rated ones.Streeting said: “We must be honest about the state of theNHSto fix it. Patients and taxpayers have to know how their local NHS services are doing compared to the rest of the country.”League table of NHS trustsThe league tables cover all 205 NHS trusts in England, which provide acute, mental health, community-based or ambulance care. The tables will be updated every three months and are based on 30 different metrics, including how long patients wait for A&E care and planned treatment, the trust’s financial position and patients’ direct experiences.The Department ofHealthand Social Care said that publication marked “the start of a new era of transparency and accountability in the NHS, with league tables delivering on the government’s promise to drive up standards, tackle variation in care and ensure people get the high-quality service they rightly expect”.High-performing trusts will be given greater freedom from NHS England and Whitehall control, while poorer performers will receive “enhanced support” to help them improve.Ministers are reviving the league tables, which were introduced as “star ratings” in 2000 under Tony Blair’s government, to tryto reverse a slump in public satisfaction with the NHS. The coalition government scrapped those ratings in 2010.“This isn’t naming and shaming,” a Department of Health official insisted. “It’s about identifying areas of challenge so we can help trusts make their way up the table.”Thea Stein, the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust thinktank, said the fact that trusts’ finances were used to judge them meant that the league tables would be “of limited use for patients trying to choose the best hospital for their care”.She added: “The scheme also risks discouraging people from getting treatment from poorly performing trusts or staff from working for them.”Small trusts, and those in remote areas, some of which have struggled to provide high-quality care, could be badly affected, Stein said.Danielle Jefferies, an analyst at the King’s Fund thinktank, saidin a blogpost: “Whether these league tables will be helpful to the public is questionable, because hospital performance is not as simple as good or bad.”A hospital might have short A&E waiting times but not give patients access to non-urgent care within the 18-week target or a cancer diagnosis within 28 days, she said. Jefferies added that a single overall rating for a trust could not properly convey the range of performance when one trust ran a number of hospitals, such as the 10 operated by the Manchester University trust.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A lower score denotes a higher-performing trust.The best performers were trusts that provided specialist care, such as first-placed Moorfields, the Royal national orthopaedic hospital in outer London (second), Christie cancer hospital in Manchester (third) and Liverpool heart and chest hospital (fourth).Northumbria, ranked ninth, was the best-performing non-specialist acute hospital, followed by University College London.Papers for a Moorfields board meeting in July show that it was the 10th best performer in England for patients waiting 18 weeks for elective care, third for providing diagnostic tests within six weeks and second for four-hour A&E performance.Meanwhile, Labour politicians were warned on Tuesday that they could lose the next election to Reform UK unless they transform health and local NHS services in England’s poorest areas.The warning was contained in research for the Independent Commission on Neighbourhoods, chaired by Labour grandee Hilary Armstrong.Ministers need to ensure that the network of promised “neighbourhood health centres”, offering a range of NHS services, opens in deprived areas as soon as possible, the report said, adding: “Getting this right could be the difference in the government being re-elected or returning to opposition.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHospitalsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Now Bagpuss, “the most important, the most beautiful, the most magical saggy old cloth cat in the whole wide world” has been dusted off to star in a new film.The original show was primarily stop-motion with some paper cutout and conventional animation work, while the big screen reboot will combine live action and animation, with a projected release date of 2027.‘The cameras were held together with Meccano’: how we made BagpussRead moreVoted the the all-time favourite children’s programme in 1999, the show was made by the Clangers co-creators Peter Firmin and Oliver Postgate, and filmed in the former’s barn in Blean, Kent.Firmin’s daughter, Emily, played a little girl of the same name who runs a shop for lost property which focuses on repair, rather than resale. Each episode featured a new item being brought in and then inspected by Bagpuss and fellow shop residents including Madeleine the rag doll, Gabriel the toad, and a woodpecker called Professor Yaffle based on Bertrand Russell.The series also featured a huge number of specially written songs, largely derived from folk tunes, and has since proved especially popular with musicians. The 2003 Radiohead single There Three has the subtitle “The Boney King of Nowhere”, which was a song from Bagpuss.While the series was set in the Victorian era – with a sepia-tinted photograph in the opening credits giving way to colour as the toys come alive – the film will be set in the modern day.According to Birmingham-based production company Threewise Entertainment, which is developing the film, the story will involve Bagpuss and friends awakening to find themselves in contemporary Britain, where they continue their work mending broken items.It will be, says the company, a “quest that blends heartfelt storytelling, comedy and music, while staying true to the spirit of the classic series”. The estates of both creators are involved in the reboot, with Emily Firmin saying:“Bagpuss was an integral part of my childhood. To me he wasn’t just a character on the screen, he was a friend who taught me about kindness, care and imagination.“To see our most magical cat return now is incredibly moving and I’m thrilled that new fans will have the chance to discover him, and that his magic will live on and be shared with the next generation.”In 2009, Daniel Postgate, Oliver’s son and a Bafta-winning writer in his own right, blocked a proposed CGI TV return for the cat, saying he did not want a “lightweight” remake and adding that he felt CGI had “a slightly lurid quality, even at the best of times”.Threewise said that the film was developed with and approved by Daniel Postgate before his death in June.Other classics of British children’s TV to have made the leap to the big screen include Postman Pat, Wallace & Gromit, Fireman Sam and Thomas the Tank Engine.Explore more on these topicsFilmFamily filmsChildren's TVnewsShareReuse this content"

With several people having already ruled themselves out, here are some possible, and probable, runners:Emily ThornberryAs someone from the backbenches who is nonetheless of cabinet-level heft, and who is seen as independent but not a recreational rebel, Thornberry is one of the more likely people to reach the nomination threshold.An MP since 2005, Thornberry was shadow attorney general for nearly three years – only to be dumped from the frontbench by Keir Starmer after the general election. She has since become chair of the foreign affairs select committee.One possible barrier for Thornberry is the fact that, like her leader, she is a north London MP. In fact, their constituencies adjoin. Some MPs and members may prefer a wider geographical spread.Bridget PhillipsonYes, she’s the education secretary, one of the few cabinet ministers to stay in the same job after last week’s reshuffle prompted by Rayner’s departure, and this could count against her if MPs want their deputy to be more of a voice for the rank and file.But in Phillipson’s favour, she would in some ways be a like-for-like replacement for Rayner, representing a northern seat (Houghton and Sunderland South), and growing up in a council home in Washington, making it from a state school to Oxford University.Generally liked by many MPs and the membership, Phillipson has been a dynamic minister, even if her flagship schools billattracted some criticism.Lucy PowellPowell would bring a similar geographical balance to Phillipson, given her Manchester constituency, but also some of Thornberry’s outsider status, having lost her job as leader of the Commons in last week’s reshuffle.Her former job helped Powell make links with Labour MPs, and as someone on the party’s soft left she would most likely be seen as sufficiently independent of Downing Street without panicking the team around Starmer.Alison McGovernIn what is becoming something of a theme, the newly minted housing and communities minister (moved on Friday from her employment brief) also represents a northern seat – Birkenhead – and is sufficiently soft left to potentially make MPs and members think she could offer an alternative view to No 10.Popular and amiable, McGovern has been an MP since 2010, and was a councillor in Southwark, south London, before then, so knows the party inside out.Sarah OwenOnly an MP since 2019, Owen is relatively little-known outside parliament beyond her Luton North constituency, but has gained a reputation for being an effective and energetic MP and Commons performer, particularly in her current role chairing the women and equalities committee.The first MP of south-east Asian background – her mother has Malaysian Chinese heritage – Owen, who is also on the moderate left of Labour, seemed set for a frontbench career but resigned as a shadow levelling up minister in 2023 in protest at Labour’s stance over Gaza.Stella CreasyThis would not be Creasy’s first tilt at the job, and the Walthamstow MP pointedly refused in a BBC interview on Monday to rule herself out. Back in 2015, she came second to Tom Watson in the members’ vote to succeed Harriet Harman as deputy party leader.Creasy is a hugely experienced and highly effective backbench MP and a successful campaigner, if not always an instinctive team player.Richard BurgonOne of a list of possible representatives from the more robust left of Labour, the Leeds East MP was shadow justice secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, but is now one of the more vocal critics of Starmer from the backbenches.If he did stand, Burgon could struggle to reach 80 endorsements – not least because of the feeling that if Labour still cannot elect a female leader, the deputy should be a woman.Explore more on these topicsLabour party deputy leadershipLabourEmily ThornberryBridget PhillipsonLucy PowellAngela RaynerexplainersShareReuse this content"

But his visit was always about distraction, even if it exposed his flawsAndrew Lawrenceat Flushing MeadowsMon 8 Sep 2025 09.21 EDTLast modified on Mon 8 Sep 2025 15.16 EDTShareIt was just the authoritarian image Donald Trump hoped to project at the US Open: the president himself, looming from Arthur Ashe Stadium’s giant screens like Chairman Mao at Tiananmen Gate, as he stood at attention for the national anthem. But there was no denying that, while the picture was there, the sound clashed. The burst of cheers that went up for his stiff salute on Sunday was quicklydrowned out by a chorus of boosmade louder from the Ashe roof being closed for rain – perhaps fitting given that many fans had been left to stand in the wet and endure the long security lines that resulted from his attendance. In that awkward five-second moment, as the Stars and Stripes was unfurled on center court, the president smirked at the negative reaction. It surely rang so familiar.Trump’s presence at the US Open men’s final wasn’t just intended as a soft power grab, the kind of routine stunt Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un and the other despots he admires pull all the time at sports events – except with recruitment ads for Ice playing across the US. No, Trump’s presence was intended as a distraction. Not a distraction for him; lord knows, he couldn’t care less about the actual match, a fact that was reinforced when Trump left his luxury box seat to step inside and kibitz with a phalanx of suck-ups. No, Trump’s visit was dropped like a flash bang to divert attention fromklaxoning recession indicators,rumbling speculation about his healthand, naturally, those files about that guywhose name must not be mentioned.If Trump was motivated by a patriotic love for tennis, he would have rocked up a day earlier forthe women’s final. But for Trump the prospect of cheering on Jersey girl Amanda Anisimova and her epic comeback story clearly wasn’t juicy enough, much less the idea of actuallysharingthe spotlight with an American player. So Sunday’s match-up between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz was retrofitted for Trump’s calliope Maga stage. Before the tilt Alcaraz, a Spaniard, was asked about playing in front of the president, and stepped right into the trap. “For me, playing in front of him, I don’t want myself to be nervous,” he said, not realizing his words would soon become fodder forFox and Friends. “I think it’s great for tennis to have the president into the final.”The USTA’s censorship of Trump dissent at the US Open is cowardly, hypocritical and un-American | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreFormer presidents have shown that you can appear at a US Open without making it about ego: the Obamas were clearly caught up in supporting a US playerwhen they watched Frances Tiafoe battle Alcarazin the 2022 semi-final. Bill Clinton was proudly Team USA, too. In 2000, in his final weeks as president, he broke away from the UN Millennium Summit for Pete Sampras’s semi-final against Lleyton Hewitt, joining John McEnroe in the commentary box and signing balls fans lobbed up to him as Secret Service minders looked on and snipers lined the stadium upper deck. Clinton also visited Sampras in the locker room after the loss to Hewitt, which postponed the American’s epic quest for a then-record 14th grand slam. In 2009 Clinton returned and gave the keynote speech for Arthur Ashe’s induction into the US Open’s Court of Champions. He remembered Ashe’s triumphs over segregation, apartheid and his efforts to open his sport up to under-resourced and represented communities.Trump’s presence on Sunday – under the Ashe stadium marquee, on grounds named for gender and LGBTQ+ pioneer Billie Jean King, at a tournament that makes a point of touting its unwavering commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion – didn’t just strike a marked contrast. It broke from the markedly lower profiles of past presidents and was over-the-top, even for a sport that regularly hosts royal families. But Trump simply couldn’t pass up the optics. Getting booed by a multicultural east coast crowd that laps up$23 cocktails and $100 caviar-dolloped chicken nuggetswithout irony is red meat his base would devour. And getting that last laugh would make for satisfying personal revenge, an urgent second-term theme.For 40 years Trump exploited the US Open for clout, calling attention to himself, his luxury box perch and all the bold-faced names who joined him inside. But the New York crowd – the heart of the Open – never cottoned to his faux-gold flash and didn’t hesitate to jeer his big screen pop-ups even then. After the golden escalator ride to kick off his 2015 presidential campaign and the fiery announcement speech hitting out at immigrants and foreigners, he effectively became spectator non-grata in Flushing. Months later he attended the US Open quarter-final between Venus and Serena Williams and heard more boos as he slunk away with Melania, out of the stadium’s “President’s Gate”. So it meant something for him on Sunday to be back 10 years later, at the same event that was once the crown jewel of CBS and a lead-in for 60 Minutes – two more institutionshe is determined to get even with– and back in the hometownhe has repeatedly threatened to invade. That is, when he’s not outrightdeclaring war on Chicago.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump appears on the jumbotron during the US Open final.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesBefore Trump’s arrival in his native borough of Queens, as foot soldiers from homeland security and other federal agencies swept the US Open campus, the USTA seemed as if it might do more to accommodate him than Rolex CEO Jean-Frederic Dufour – whohad reportedly invited the presidentto the company’s luxury suite in hopes of catching a break on US tariffs imposed on Switzerland. No doubt Trump would have sat in the umpire’s chair if that were an option. The day before the men’s final, news broke that the USTA had issued a memo to broadcasters urging them to avoid showing any dissent against Trump ina craven display of anticipatory obediencethat the federation cowardly justified in an 11-word statement. (We thought the former reality show host was supposed to be againstunfair editing…) In the moments Trump actually seemed to be paying attention to Sunday’s match, he didn’t really cheer or applaud – which is weird but not surprising. He had made the day about himself, after all.And yet: just when it seemed as if the USTA couldn’t bow down any lower, intentionally or not, it may have pulled off a canny rope-a-dope. Perhaps mindful of the president’s avarice forstolen valor, they set the US Open men’s trophy inside the Rolex box for Trump’s arrival, and then switched it for a doubles cup after the anthem. Breaking with its own edict, the USTA not only showed Trump on the big screen again during the changeover between the first and second sets, it pushed in and held the shot for 20 seconds. The crowd, much larger this time, booed him so long and lustily that it was hard not to be reminded of theharsh reception to Trump at the 2019 World Series. Later on Sunday, the camera cut to noted Trump bugbear Bruce Springsteen – triggering a roar of approval that nearly blew the Ashe roof off.Unlike Fifa at July’s Club World Cup final, the USTA ensured Trump’s Rolex perch became a prison by the end of the match, so Alcaraz could keep up the winner’s tradition of climbing into the crowd to embrace their support team. Trump could only watch, like a kid on punishment seeing his friends play outside, as someone other than him presented the trophy to Alcaraz – because, well, he’s no competition for Ivan Lendl and much better men than Trump have tried taking trophies from the former No 1. After the pomp and circumstance, Trump was gone – back on the road within minutes of match point and in the air not long thereafter, according to the White House pool report. The outsized security presence that turned Sunday’s showcase into an authoritarian spectacle disappeared in his wake, too. For many fans who had suffered through it all, his departure was more cause for celebration.Theodore Roosevelt’s daughter, Alice, once said of her father that “he wants to be the bride at every wedding, the corpse at every funeral, and the baby at every christening.” But the line fits Trump even better. As long as there is attention to be had, you can bet he’ll find a way to make himself the center of it and make sport of self-aggrandizement, regardless of who, or what, he may trample over on his march.This article was amended on 8 September 2025. We originally identified Alice Roosevelt Longworth’s father as Franklin Delano Roosevelt. She was, in fact, the daughter of Theodore Roosevelt.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisUS sportsTennisDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What might happen now?Measures so far have not induced Moscow to stop the war in Ukraine. Will fresh sanctions finally halt Putin’s advance?Jennifer Rankinin BrusselsMon 8 Sep 2025 13.44 EDTLast modified on Mon 8 Sep 2025 14.08 EDTShareEU officials are meeting their US counterparts to discuss what could be the first coordinated transatlantic sanctions against Russia sinceDonald Trumpreturned to the White House. The US president, who has previously stepped back from financial threats to Russia, has this week said he is ready to move to a second stage of sanctions. Their form, if they were to come, is however not yet clear.What sanctions has the west so far agreed against Russia?Since Vladimir Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv’s western allies have sanctioned more than 2,500 people and entities, including Putin himself, ministers, oligarchs, military commanders, propagandists, state and private companies aiding the war. Soon after the Russian tanks rolled in, western allies froze an estimated $335bn (€300bn) of Russian central bank assets; cut many Russian banks out of the international financial system via a ban on use of the Swift messaging service; froze sales of military equipment or anything that could be repurposed for making war; ended exports of numerous consumer goods and – eventually – banned imports of Russian diamonds.These sanctions followed earlier western restrictive measures after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. They have been followed by separate sanctions (travel bans and asset freezes) against individuals culpable of human rights abuses in Russia, such as the jailors of the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny.What are the gaps?Measures so far have not proved nearly enough to induce Moscow to stop the war. Russia has vital lifelines via energy sales and middlemen in non-western countries that sell on sanctioned goods. While western countries quickly banned imports of Russian coal – which could be easily replaced – oil and gas proved more problematic, especially for the EU.The EU has banned most Russian oil imports, butgranted an exemption to Hungary and Slovakia, and still gets 3% of oil imports from Russia. The bloc gets 13% of gas imports from Russia, compared with 45% in 2021, but has pledged tophase out all Russian fossil fuel imports by 2028.Wealthy G7 countries and the EUimposed a price cap on Russian oil, meaning that ships transporting crude oil cannot use western ports or shipping services, such as insurance. In response, Russia has increased sales of discounted oil to China and India, creating a shadow fleet of poorly maintained, unregistered vessels to transport the fuel at prices above the western cap. EU officials have imposed sanctions on 444 shadow fleet vessels, but concede that new boats are appearing constantly, keeping the trade alive.More broadly, plenty of individuals and companies in non-western countries, such as Turkey, the Caucasus and China, have proved willing to help Russia get round sanctions, by acting as a middleman to sell sanctioned goods.What is the impact of western sanctions?Sanctions have inflicted real pain on the Russian economy, fuelling inflation, eroding the national wealth fund and threatening a long-term decline in living standards. But the economy has not collapsed, nor has the Kremlin halted its aggression against Ukraine. The Russian economy continues to grow, as a result of massive war spending, albeit at lower levels than before. Proponents of sanctions argue they are working, by forcing Russia to make trade-offs and increase costs, reorienting to a war economy at the expense of social welfare.The Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics (Site), which has studied the Russian economy, has also cast doubt on the accuracy of Russia’s official economic data, suggesting the picture is worse than it appears, that inflation and deficits are understated and GDP overstated. In May, Torbjörn Becker, Site director, forecast that by mid-2026 Russia will struggle to sustain the war at the current level. But in the meantime, Russia is escalating its war on Ukraine, as shown by weeks of deadly air attacks.What has been the Trump effect?Before his re-election last year, many European capitals feared that the return of Donald Trump to the White House could lead to the US lifting its sanctions on Russia overnight, causing damaging cracks in the western alliance against Russia. After failing to end the war in 24 hours, Trump has repeatedly threatened sanctions, as he grows more impatient that his peacemaking efforts are yet to pay off.The US president said in March he was“pissed off” with Putinand threatened to impose sanctions if there was no truce within a month. The deadline passed without action. By July, Trump was “very unhappy” with Putin and threatened to impose 100% secondary tariffs on countries buying Russian oil if no ceasefire deal was reached in 50 days – a deadline he later shortened. The deadline came and went with no action taken.After his Alaska summit, theUS imposed 50% tariffs on India, ostensibly for its purchases of Russian oil, but has declined to take the same action on other buyers, such as China. After the latest massive attacks on Ukraine, Trump was asked if he was ready to move to the second phase of sanctions against Russia. “Yeah, I am,” he said, without elaborating.What will happen now?EU leaders hope Trump will make good on his threats, amid indications of greater cooperation on sanctions against Russia since the departure of Joe Biden. The EU’s sanctions envoy, David O’Sullivan, was meeting US officials in Washington on Monday to discuss actions against Russia. Meanwhile, senior US administration figures have made clear they would like the EU to go further on sanctions, especially in ending purchases of Russian fossil fuels.Senior EU and US officials have argued in favour oftougher secondary sanctions, measures against countries that help Russia circumvent sanctions. That could open further transatlantic tensions. Following the US lead on India will be difficult, as Brussels seeks a trade deal with New Delhi. The EU has sanctioned a few Chinese companies, but stopped short of sweeping measures against one of its largest trading partners, as it seeks to carve out an independent stance on China, compared with the US.The EU is expected to propose further ideas for sanctions against Russia in the coming days. But with a US president who has elevatedunpredictability to a foreign policy doctrine, nobody knows what Trump will do.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeVladimir PutinDonald TrumpEuropean UnionForeign policyexplainersShareReuse this content"

His new movie Nuremberg, about the show put on for the rest of the world to indict Nazi war criminals, is packaged like old-fashioned entertainment. There are movie stars (chiefly Rami Malek and Russell Crowe) with slicked-back hair, trading snappy barbs and self-important monologues in smoky rooms, meanwhile the gravity of the moment tends to be kept at bay. All the bureaucratic and legal speak around fine-tuning an unprecedented process, where one country prosecutes the high command of another, goes down easy in an Aaron Sorkin sort of way. It is riveting when its urgency is defended by an actor as great as Michael Shannon. It is all so watchable, to a fault, especially when dealing with the unspeakable.Ballad of a Small Player review – Colin Farrell wins us over in flashy, slight gambler taleRead moreThere’s some rhyme and reason to the director’s approach. Vanderbilt (who wrote the screenplay for David Fincher’s Zodiac, a masterpiece about the impossible pursuit for truth) has made a movie about two figures so narcissistic, opportunistic and caught up in the showmanship that they leave very little room for the gravity of the moment to sink in.Malek plays Douglas M Kelley, the psychiatrist tasked with monitoring the indicted prisoners’ mental health, just to make sure they don’t kill themselves before they stand trial. We meet him confidently flirting with a woman on a train, playing card tricks to show off his ability to read and misdirect his opponents.Crowe, often shot to fill the frame, plays Hermann Göring, the commander in chief of the Luftwaffe deemed the second most powerful man in Germany. He’s introduced in an opening that quickly goes from clever to flippant, where onscreen text announces that Adolf Hitler is dead and 70 million have perished in the war. In one take we watch as migrants move on foot through an Austrian wasteland (a road to where would be the question) and a soldier relieves himself on the swastika painted on a bombed-out Nazi vehicle.In comes Crowe’s Göring, chauffeured in a limousine, surrendering to the allied forces by commanding they take his luggage. Crowe is one of the few people onscreen who can manage the comic relief without undercutting the weight of his character, whatever humour or witticisms Göring dishes out laced with calculated malevolence.Much of Nuremberg hangs on the scenery chewing between Kelley and Göring during casual therapy sessions, where both seem to bond over their shared affinity for gamesmanship, while ultimately pursuing their own claim to infamy. Göring is gearing up for a trial where he can reinforce the Nazi ideals he still stands by, and go down as a martyr if he must, while taking no responsibility for the Holocaust. Kelley can’t wait to write a book on what goes on in the minds of Nazis.Spoiler alert: the fruit of Kelley’s labour is called 22 Cells in Nuremberg. In his review of the 1947 book’s assessments – about how Nazi psychology could not only influence those abroad but was in part fostered by the west – Fredric Wertham writes “there is little in America today which could prevent the establishment of a Nazi-like state.” Vanderbilt’s Nuremberg hammers down on that argument, and its relevance today, with Crowe’s Göring echoing a familiar slogan when he says Hitler “made us feel German again”.The point Vanderbilt perhaps unintentionally skirts, is how ultimately hollow the spectacle at Nuremberg can feel; not just in his movie, but since prosecuting war crimes and establishing international law has done nothing to prevent the atrocities in Gaza. That sort of realness never cracks through the polished surfaces in Vanderbilt’s Nuremberg, which is too often seduced by the spectacle it should be more critical of.The movie reduces Kelley’s psychiatric insights into soundbites, manages to whittle down the proceedings at the Nuremberg trials into the familiar tropes and cliches from classic courtroom movies, and even lets Crowe’s performance surrender its nuances to hammy villainy, all for the sake of reliable entertainment.A pivotal point in Nuremberg arrives during the trial, when prosecutors show shocking and horrifying footage filled with emaciated, mutilated and decaying bodies at concentration camps. Vanderbilt opts to show the real footage. But instead of ushering in the gravity this movie keeps at a distance for so long, the authentic material only highlights how artificial everything surrounding it really is.Nuremberg is screening at theToronto film festivaland will be released 7 November in the US and 14 November in the UKExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewToronto film festivalFestivalsRussell CroweRami MalekDrama filmsWar filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

There is a ripple in the firmament, a vibration in the foundations, a bracing of the cosmos … yes,Mark Ruffalois preparing to Act again. This time, he stars in crime drama Task, created by Mare of Easttown’s Brad Inglesby, as a former priest turned FBI agent nursing a great sorrow in the suitably grey environs of suburban Philadelphia. Tom Brandis ends every day in a drunken semi-stupor and begins every morning with prayer and a head-dunk into an ice-filled sink. Do you think we might be in for a meditation on guilt, sin and the possibility of redemption? Yes, I wearily agree.So. Brandis is taken off the desk duties he has been assigned since his great sorrow. This is evidently connected to the sentencing hearing for a third-degree murder conviction he is due to attend next week, where his daughter Emily may be giving a family impact statement – but we will have to wait just long enough for it to feel outright manipulative before we get the full explanation of who killed who and how. Brandis is assigned to a new taskforce to investigate a series of armed break-ins at drug houses owned by the Dark Hearts biker gang, in the hope that arrests can be made before Philly is consumed by a turf war. He has three youngsters to help him: the charmingly arrogant, Catholic-raised Anthony (Fabien Frankel); the supremely competent Aleah (Thuso Mbedu); and the supremely incompetent Lizzie (Alison Oliver). Their single characteristics allow Brandis to prove his priestly credentials (God-talks with the lapsed Anthony), his generosity of spirit (this middle-aged man is not threatened by youthful ability!) and patience (I would return her to Quantico instantly, bearing a large label that read “Not fit for purpose”) and not much else.View image in fullscreenNot fit for purpose? … Mark Ruffalo, Alison Oliver, Thuso Mbedu and Fabien Frankel in Task.Photograph: 2025 Home Box Office, IncThe raids are being conducted by garbagemen and best friends Robbie (Tom Pelphrey) and Cliff (Raúl Castillo), who can tell from the trash cans on their route which dealers’ houses have recently disposed of drugs and filled up with cash. How they know which are Dark Hearts facilities and why they are specialising in those will again become clear in the fullness of time. They are accompanied on the raids by younger friend Peaches (Owen Teague), who you might suspect is marked for death the moment he expresses his joy at the fact that he has just become engaged. I couldn’t possibly comment.Apropos nothing, Task ticks all the expected boxes. There are bloody shootouts, corpses and bags full of fentanyl instead of cash grabbed in chaotic getaways which will then require selling. Which requires finding a buyer. Which requires becoming further enmeshed in the drugs world – and more identifiable to those seeking to destroy you for killing their men and taking their 12 kilos of fentanyl in the first place. Especially as you also kidnapped a child witness in the process.Now, Mare of Easttown was no picnic. But it had plenty of black humour and was full of vividly drawn, wholly believable family relationships and friendships that gave it a sense of life in the round. The criminality mattered because it affected people in all walks of life. Task, by contrast, is relentlessly bleak, humourless and narratively airless. It is not just the Brandis family that is crushed by terrible griefs and burdens. Robbie’s wife has left him and he is mourning the death of his brother Billy. His niece Maeve (Emilia Jones), Billy’s daughter, is dying by inches under the strain of looking after Robbie’s motherless children, which does not seem a fair trade for letting him move in with her after her father’s death left her with a house.It flattens the characters into ciphers, deadens the story and as time goes on, makes the whole thing inescapably boring. It is not as if we haven’t seen everything on show before. Let’s find another way to propel a plot – or maybe even find another plot entirely – especially in Philadelphia.But if formulaic yet weighty stuff is your bag, if gestures towards bigger issues rather than actual interrogations of them are all you’re up to at the moment, then a relatively enjoyable Task lies before you. For anything else, you can always rewatch Mare of Easttown.Task aired on Sky Atlantic and is on Now in the UK.

Within its 19-minute running time it appears to try summarising the action of an entire 90-minute feature film. There isn’t a moment to really relax and explore any relationship in any satisfying and plausible way; the line-readings are rushed and uncomfortable and, most bewilderingly, Seal doesn’t actually get to sing all that much, although as an actor he has a strong and confident address to the camera.Nuremberg review – Russell Crowe’s Göring vs Rami Malek’s psychiatrist in swish yet glib courtroom showdownRead moreThe premise is that Millicent (played by Nse Ikpe-Etim) runs a vibrant and hugely successful club in Lagos, but she is very ill, and the question of who is to inherit this lucrative, fashionable place causes a tense confrontation with Millicent’s daughters Comfort (Eku Edewor) and Patience (Atlanta Bridget Johnson) who have come from London with the candid intention of selling up for cash; they resent having to defer to their Lagos-based sister Bisi (Constance Olatunde), who is much more committed to the club. And what causes, or should theoretically cause, the emotional temperature to rise is the reappearance of Johnson (played by Seal), a good-natured musician who has been away in the army and whose paternity of one or all the young women is naturally a central issue.Inevitably, it is Johnson’s performance, in concert with Bisi, which is to cause instant reconciliation for one and all, but that is a glib, cliched idea that doesn’t work dramatically or musically. Dust to Dreams could have come to life if it had tried to do more with less, perhaps amplify one or two of the many micro-episodes crunched together here.As it is, this feels like a luxury-vanity project and an oddity in the CVs of all the talents involved.Dust to Dreams is screening at the Toronto film festivalExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025Idris ElbaToronto film festivalShort filmsSealFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

To discover what we really need, we must move beyond the shallowsMoya SarnerMon 8 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 8 Sep 2025 14.41 EDTShareEver since I discovered the mating dynamics ofthe deep-sea anglerfish, where the male fuses with the female, and how closely this mirrors some disturbing human relationship patterns, I have been chewing over the idea that everything that exists in our unconscious also exists in the ocean. From the methodical violence of sharks, to dolphins who mourn their dead and jellyfish whose pulsating contractions remind me of my labour, the only phenomenon on Earth that is as rich and colourful and dark and fascinating as the deep sea is the deep unconscious.My problem, as I realised in a session not long ago with my psychoanalyst, is that I have been swimming in shallow waters. This is something I have seen many times in myself, and perhaps these moments of recognition help me to see it in my patients – the unconscious pull to stay in the emotional shallows, not to delve deeper into your own internal experience and understand the more profound wishes and hungers that drive us. Instead, we scroll away our difficult feelings, staring at whatever screen is in front of us rather than looking inwards. We cheapen our relationships with others, craving and offering a particular kind of emotional stroking that keeps things at surface level. We buy things, we watch things, we listen to things, we squeeze things, we try things on and send things back, and we do, do, do – wedoto stay in the shallows, so we don’t have to be in the depths.But we know the way to a better life sits below the surface, not on it. I recently read the brilliant How to Speak Whale by Tom Mustill, who writes about the Dutch microbiologist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. In the mid-17thcentury, Leeuwenhoek developed magnification technology comparable to modern light microscopes, which exposed the truth of the extraordinary life teeming within a “thimbleful of water from a local lake”. Mustill offers us Leeuwenhoek’s wonderful quote: “No more pleasant sight has yet met my eye than this of so many thousands of living creatures in one small drop of water, all huddling and moving.”Unfelt emotions are like deep-sea creatures – hidden, powerful, and capable of immense force when brought to lightIt made me think again of our unconscious; the extraordinary depth of meaning hiding within one slip of the tongue, one image in a dream. A patient can seem to be having a lovely time in their session, and a single blink-and-you’ll-miss-it half-glance towards the door can reveal they’re absolutely desperate to get out; their politeness hiding the painful emotions that they didn’t realise they were so desperate to run away from.If I draw their attention towards that glance, towards their true feelings, it offers them the opportunity to realise that this is what has actually kept them running around in circles, stuck exactly where they have always been. This can then be the doorway – if they choose to walk through it – to a better life.These unfelt, unconscious emotions, whatever they might be – pain, rage, envy, hatred, love, guilt, shame – are like the powerful creatures living deep in the sea. Both are capable of incredible force: the energy that comes from immense weight and propulsion. To bring these feelings and dynamics into consciousness is what it means to me to swim in deeper waters; to live more truly, with more weight and more propulsion, with a particular kind of energy, building a life that is truly meaningful.Mustill’s book tells the powerful story of how, in the 20thcentury, whales were hunted and feared, valued by humans only for what their butchered body parts could be sold for, and destroyed to near-extinction by the end of the 1960s. It was Dr Roger Payne who was determined to save them by helping people to understand the intrinsic worth of these creatures through the beauty of their song. Released in 1970, his album of recordings, Songs of the Humpback Whale, went multi-platinum, and became the soundtrack to the protest movement that ultimately resulted in the 1982 adoption of a moratorium on commercial whaling by the International Whaling Commission. Estimates suggest that in the 19thcentury, humans killed about 3 million whales; today, many populations are “rebounding and expanding”, Mustill writes. “This is a counterpoint to the dangerous narrative of innate human destructiveness, which leads to apathy. It shows how we can change, and life can recover.”I see this as a therapist in my consulting room most days, and I occasionally get a taste of it as a patient myself. Our capacity to destroy sits alongside our creative power to repair and recover. When therapy is useful, and a patient can grow the capacity to allow their true feelings into their minds, this can spark a new thought, often one that links their past with their present, that illuminates how something got stuck along the way. This can light the way out of apathy to new life. We can unstick, we can change. We can make things better for ourselves, for the natural world, and the generations to come. But just like Leeuwenhoek with his magnifying glass, we have to go deep.Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author ofWhen I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of AdulthoodDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Almost immediately, the Spanish director knew the film needed a labour scene. “For all the women, giving birth had been a very traumatic event,” she says. She heard stories about women in labour not being informed of procedures, or having their hearing partners removed from the room, depriving them of an interpreter as well as support. “I left out some of the most difficult experiences.”Her film gives us a frighteningly realistic birth scene. “Push, push hard,” shouts a doctor behind a face mask at the end of a long, drawn-out labour. The woman giving birth is Ángela, who is deaf and can’t read the doctor’s lips because of their face mask. Frightened and alone, Ángela lunges forward and rips off the mask. Her hearing partner is in the room. He’s meant to be interpreting, but was ordered from her bedside as things began to look like they might go wrong.She sees her baby joining this world she can never be 100% part of. She fears being left outThe common thread in all the stories Libertad heard was a feeling of desperation. “If birth is already difficult for hearing mothers, for deaf mothers it’s worse. There is the feeling: how will I know if something goes wrong? A fear that anything could happen.” Libertad is speaking over Zoom from her home in Molina de Segura, a town near Murcia. She used actual doctors and nurses in the scene to add realism. But no casting process was necessary to find an actor to play her lead character Ángela: Libertad hired her sister, Miriam Garlo, a well-known stage actor who is deaf.Garlo was seven years old when she lost most of her hearing as the result of an allergic reaction. “I had a severe ear infection that led to high fevers,” she tells me. “I was given aspirin, which contains an acid that caused hearing damage – I lost 70% of my hearing.” This has now increased to 90%. “At the time, I didn’t experience it as something traumatic. I was just a child. My life changed completely, but I adapted out of survival.”After studying fine art, Garlo trained as an actor. The sisters collaborated on a short film in 2021 also called Deaf: “At the time, Miriam was considering whether to become a mother,” Libertad says. “She shared with me her fears about becoming a deaf mother in a hearing world. And that’s where the short was born from.”In the end, says Libertad, Garlo decided not to have children. “But when we wrapped on the short, I was left wanting more. What would happen if a baby came along?” So Libertad wrote a feature film about what happened next. Ángela is an artist and potter who lives in the Spanish countryside with her hearing partner Héctor (Álvaro Cervantes), and their dog and chickens. At the start of the film they are in a bubble of pregnancy bliss. The relationship looks as good as it gets; they love each other and their communication is solid. But parenthood changes their dynamic in ways that are difficult to navigate.Becoming a mother, says Libertad, throws Ángela back into ableist society. “At the beginning you can see she has ownership over her own life and her own world. But with pregnancy, she once again has to face all these challenges she thought she’d overcome.” We see it most dramatically when she gives birth: the maternity care system is completely unprepared for a deaf woman.The film also shows the day-to-day challenges. When her daughter starts nursery, Ángela finds it difficult to lipread during hurried conversations at pick-ups. A mum asks for her number for the class WhatsApp group. Ángela doesn’t understand. Embarrassed, she smiles and walks away.View image in fullscreenGarlo and Libertad at the Malaga film festival.Photograph: Sipa US/AlamyÁngela’s daughter can hear, and in painful scenes Ángela begins to worry that she will be isolated from her baby and partner. “She sees her baby joining this world that she can never be 100% part of. A world that her partner is part of. So she has a fear of being left out.”Not for the first time, Libertad tells me that Ángela does not represent all deaf mothers: “That would be impossible. There are as many ways of being a deaf mother as deaf mothers exist in the world.” Besides, hearing women have written to her to say they also identify with Ángela: “They talk about the same fear of not being a good mother, or of not fully bonding with their baby, or the fear of their baby preferring their partner over them.”Until I learned sign language, my identity was broken. Like it had snapped in twoTwo days later I speak to Garlo, Deaf’s star, at her home; she lives four doors down from her sister. There are two interpreters on the video call, one translating Spanish Sign Language into Spanish, the second Spanish to English. For our entire 60-minute conversation, Garlo leans into her camera, her focus sharp. In her job as an actor, she is used to concentrating on the invisible labour of reading lips.“With directors who don’t know sign language, I’ve had to really work hard to listen with my eyes, to understand what they want, what they need in a scene,” she says. “I’m doing the work of interpreting. I’m having to make double the effort.” Which sounds exhausting, I say. “It is. It really drains my energy. Because if I don’t understand the instructions for a task, I’m not going to do it well.”Deaf shows Garlo’s ability to inhabit a character completely. Her expressive face radiates happiness at the start of the film, then becomes increasingly anxious, taking on an edgy quality. It’s a stunning performance. But when audiences watch the movie, they often assume she is playing a version of herself. That may be because she is being directed by her sister, but ableism is a factor too, says Garlo. “Society still doesn’t understand that if you have an actor with a disability playing a character, the disability doesn’t make the character. But Ángela is not me. Her life decisions are not my life decisions.”View image in fullscreenForced back into society … friends and family in Deaf.That must be incredibly frustrating. She pulls a face as if to say that’s not the half of it. “Yes, it is very frustrating. It’s a stigma that exists towards people with disabilities, and it does bother me, because it makes it seem that I’m unable to develop any kind of character who isn’t exactly the same as me.”I read that Garlo did not learn to sign until she was 30. Is that true? She nods. Growing up, her parents didn’t really know much about sign language. They were a loving, caring family, but the focus was on education and academic attainment. “People thought of sign language just as an additional resource,” she says with a shrug. Is there a sense among hearing people that sign language is somehow a lesser language, I ask? “Yes, completely, 100%.”But learning to sign changed Garlo’s life. “Until I was 30, I didn’t understand why life was so difficult. I had to make so much effort to lipread. But once I discovered sign language, it made everything so much easier.” Did she have much involvement in the deaf community before that? She shakes her head. “I had no contact with other deaf people until I was 30.”After school, she focused all her energy on education, studying fine art in Madrid, then a master’s and a PhD. But something didn’t feel right. “It was a really sad time in my life. I fell into a major depression. I felt awful. I realised that my identity was kind of broken, like it had snapped in two. I realised that I needed sign language to connect with the deaf world. I sought it out. I found the deaf world, and I finally found people who had lives like mine. I did a sign language course when I was 30. Now I’m 40.”What did it feel like, discovering her deaf identity? Garlo smiles. “I always say the first part of my life was like living in black and white. When I learned sign language, it was like the world suddenly flooded with colour. It was my salvation – finally being able to see all the colours in the world.”Deaf is released in the UK on 12 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDeafness and hearing lossParents and parentingHealthFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a sense that thisLabourgovernment is just as terminally dysfunctional and directionless as its predecessor. I am beginning to feel the same sense of frustration, confusion, anger and depletion that I carried through all those years of Conservative government.Here we are again, with the pettiness and authoritarianism, the performatively cruel rhetoric and crackdown on immigration, the ridiculousposturing on flags, the empty sloganeering – and with the constant rebooting in order to jumpstart a broken machine. The result is that government has been reduced to the same intrusive and meaningless background noise: Keir Starmer droning on about “phase two” or “delivery, delivery, delivery”. There is a sense that it’s pointless to insist that Labour can do better, be better – because it is structurally incapable of doing so.The overwhelming feeling under this government is sometimes that of drift, at other times of heading at speed towards a crash. Either way, the destination seems to beReform UKhaving more power than should be possible with so many grownups around. It all seems, above everything, a colossal wasted opportunity for a party that sailed in on a large majority, with an eviscerated opposition and a moment ripe for the taking.At least with the Tories it was clear why governance had become an empty exercise in buying time. The party was spent, Brexit had run out of steam, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss had burned through public goodwill during Covid and economic uncertainty, and Rishi Sunak was tragically unsuited to turn it all around, even if that were possible. But what’s Labour’s excuse? Westminster is preoccupied with policy announcements, conferences, budgets, resignations and reshufflesamid personal scandal, but zoom out and what hoves into view is that the UK’s political system is imploding.I find myself reluctantly pulled into the psychodrama. Both gripped and repulsed, I have watched Starmer’s bizarre and robotic pronouncements, former home secretary and now foreign secretary Yvette Cooper’schirpy updateson forced removals and the newly minted deputy prime minister David Lammy not doing much at all. What timing, that just as the world was plunged into insecurity and conflict, the foreign secretary was a man who only spoke in platitudes about “progressive realism”. I look forward to him being loudly pointless in his new role.Collectively, these people constitute a government that is absent when required and violently invasive when not. A summer of anti-migrant protests and rising nativism is met with statements about closing asylum hotels and the importance of the flag, offering little to assuage the fears of those frightened and unsettled by the new mood. In contrast, the government mobilises toban Palestine Actionand arrest hundreds of peaceful protesters.There is something hardwired within this government that shapes its character. It is unreactive and leaden, unless it’s showing force to prove itself to a set of voters, privileged above all others, that Labour is hard enough – even though all thesignspoint to the fact that all that is achieving is more alienation. This party was fashioned in a fight against the left and its need to represent itself as “under new management”. It is defined by its distaste for its progressive wing’s history and legacy and is constantly purging its ranks and affiliations. Following the departure of Angela Rayner, a load bearer for the party’s left-leaning and working-class constituency, the cabinet reshuffle has nudged the party further rightward. Labour’s pathological insecurity that voters and the press do not buy that its leaders are sensible, grownup moderates has cannibalised the party, turning it into an organ that is driven by how it looks and sounds rather than what it wants to achieve.Yet for all its bluster, Labour’s posture and messaging ring hollow. Austerity, closed borders and security overreach are key expressions of rightwing ideology. When Labour promotes such ideas, it feels inauthentic: the product of triangulation and focus groups. It is a chronically defensive way of going about politics that misses the instinct and spirit needed to inspire trust and passion in voters. The outcome is that it has turned into a party with no natural constituency, appealing to those who will always be more at home in parties further to the right, and telling off its own voters. The end result is that same mean, scolding negativity of the Tories in their later years.At the centre of it all is the sinkhole that isKeir Starmer. The simple explanation for why he is how he is, is that he is simply unsuited to office and in over his head: a man who approaches politics on the basis of what he feels he needs to say in the moment, rather than out of belief or mission. Some of you may know him from the office: a careerist who will look you dead in the eye and tell you, the moment it becomes more convenient to take a different line, that isn’t what he said at all.But maybe the more complex reasoning for why Starmer is such a vacant leader is that only such a man could have been elected as prime minister. Only a man characterised by the ability to identify who he must ingratiate himself with could have won the electoral race, placated powerful business interests and fended off the rightwing press. It’s a political skill that could be put to good use in power if he just knew what he wanted to do with it. It turns out “ruthlessness” alone, a quality often commended when Starmer was an aspiring prime minister, is a turn-off in post, when leaders must inspire and lead as well as govern.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lucy Powell, Anneliese Dodds, Louise Haigh, Emily Thornberry, Dawn Butler, Clive Lewis –all have their supporters.But hang on a minute – before we decide who, shouldn’t we be thinking about what? What is the role of a deputy leader of theLabourparty, when Labour in government is so clearly lost, is tanking in the polls, and tens of thousands of members are walking away in bitter disappointment? When we are staring down the barrel of a Reform government and a Nigel Farage premiership?Because this can’t be just about who leads, a parade of those who crave a top job for the sake of it, without taking the time to fathom why. This is about how we lead. As Labour’s National Executive Committee meets today to rush out the timetable to get what is, for it, an unwanted slice of democracy out of the way, what’s desperately needed is just a little time to pause and think about how the Labour party gets out of this existential mess. Indeed, it’s the moment to ask what political leadership means in the chaos, complexity and confusion of the 21st century.Because the danger is that a unique opportunity will be lost for the party to have a deep conversation. Not about the usual commentary on who’s up and who’s down, on messaging and mistakes. But about what the role of a political party such as Labour is in bringing about the kind of society we want, and therefore what sort of leadership it demands.There are two options. The first is shallow and will do little, if anything, to deflect Labour away from its self-inflicted course of self-destruction. You can see this route shaping up already: mild criticisms will come from people within the party establishment. They will say they understand the system, that they are an insider who can play the system and course-correct. But the fear is that they are the system, someone who will be largely loyal to the leadership and the narrow band of party bureaucrats who think they can sneak them past the membership. This will be fatal.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and his wife Victoria at the 2024 Labour party conference in Liverpool.Photograph: James McCauley/ShutterstockI can feel the bureaucrats’ hackles rising already. Of course, they will harumph, the deputy leader must be loyal to the leader. But why, when they’re leading you off an electoral precipice? Why, when they’re paving the way for a Farage victory, because they are merely imitating Farage? Why should they be loyal when loyalty sees so many party members throw away the card in despair? And frankly, why should they be loyal when the leader himself stood on a necessary and needed platform of polices to renew our country, and then rejected all of them. And now, because of it, he stands in the polls at astonishing Liz Truss levels of disapproval.Grown-up politics is not about slavish loyalty to a lost cause. It is about navigating pragmatic compromises – or radical realism as the newMainstreamorganisation, which I and many others have set up to save Labour, suggests.To be clear, the job is not deputy leader of the parliamentary Labour party but of the whole party: its members, councillors, trade unions and affiliates. Part of the job is to act as a voice and a bridge between these different rich elements. Unity is not forged from the top down, but built from the bottom up – negotiated, not imposed. So, by definition, the deputy leader must be a pluralist. That doesn’t mean they are politically neutral – far from it – but that they recognise the limits of their own vision and actively seek out and heed voices and views that are different from theirs, and critically, to the leadership’s.Finally, Labour needs a deputy leader who understands the need to marshall countervailing forces to those who stand in the way of social and environmental justice.This is Labour’s perfect opportunity to show what 21st-century leadership is. Because it’s not about promising the earth with no capacity to deliver even a fraction of it. It’snot about delivery, delivery, delivery, as per some heroic CEO lording it over placid citizens. It’s about setting out a course, offering vision and hope.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s not me who needs their GCSEs – it’s you!” These words were barked at my year 10 science class by our science teacher and form tutor, Miss T. And deservedly so, because we had just suffered the ignominy of collectively flunking a GCSE mock exam. All 30 of us.Miss T was relatively young, but she was old-school in her approach – she had a low threshold for nonsense. While I considered this mock an inconsequential test – a pre-season friendly, if you will – she treated it like an FA Cup semi-final. To put it another way, it was half-time and we were losing badly, so she gave us thehairdryer treatment: a relentless, 15-minute tirade berating us for our lack of aptitude and our attitude.I remember it vividly: “Fail to prepare, prepare to fail!” she yelled, so disappointed she had resorted to tried-and-tested cliche. “I’ve got my GCSEs, I’ve got my job. Fix up!” I was 14 and this was perhaps the last time my hair was dried, literally and figuratively.Despite her best intentions though, we were emotionally immature teenagers, not professional athletes. To keep it frank like Lampard, I was initially affronted by her impassioned rant. It didn’t motivate me. Quite the opposite – it angered me. I felt that it was an overreaction. Our formative exams weren’t for a good 12 months, so why all the drama? She believed in her ability to teach us, right?With no revision, I had secured a D (one of the best grades in the class), so I was quite confident that if I did a little reading between the mocks and the finals, I’d be all right. “Don’t lambast me,” I wanted to tell her – “wanted” being the key word here. My grade may have been a D, but I definitely wasn’t a dunce. You crossed Miss T at your peril. Even rolling your eyes behind her back felt risky. That said, I secretlythought those who obtained a U deserved her condemnation. A U is unrighteous.With the benefit of hindsight, I know that my initial reaction was one rooted in deflection. The teenage me found comfort in dismissing my tutor’s criticism instead of committing to the hard work of self-analysis and reflection. Instead of getting angry, I should have been grateful that I was fortunate enough to have a teacher so invested in my future that she wanted to challenge me to bring out my best, all the time. Success isn’t a tap you can turn on when you feel like it; it’s the result of consistent hard work and preparation. This, in part, is the lesson I think Miss T wanted us to grasp that day.Fortunately for me, it didn’t take me long to “fix up”. My parents are Nigerian, and for them, academic brilliance is not merely a goal – it’s compulsory. A grades were acceptable, Ds were deplorable and U wasn’t even in their alphabet. Crucially, up to that point I had been relatively successful academically, but this outburst was a vital kick up the backside. I realised that being academically gifted wouldn’t be enough – hard work was required. As the adage goes: hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard.I therefore hit the books vigorously – that cool dude on the front of those CGP revision guides and I became besties. Sadly our acquaintance came at the expense of my high-flying Football Manager career. But my goodness, the hard work paid off. When I opened my GCSE results envelope the next summer, the only D was in my surname. No Cs either. One B in French – not my fault, Duolingo didn’t exist back then. The balance were Acceptable As and A*s. This would not have happened without Miss T’s “Fix up, it’s not me who needs their GCSEs – it’s you” rant.Regrettably, I never told her that. She was there on results day and, of course, I thanked her for her time and efforts, but I never conveyed the profound impact she had on me. I wish she knew.This is even more true now, because her tirade is largely responsible for my meticulous approach to work. I became obsessed with not only knowing the syllabus back to front but really understanding it. I’d work diligently throughout the year while gradually stepping up the intensity as I approached an exam period. If I ever felt like coasting or leaving work until the last minute, Miss T’s words would echo in my ears: “Fix up.”Through the international baccalaureate and medical school, this method accompanied me up the career ladder. Even beyond the classroom, Miss T’s advice holds merit. Nothing exemplifies this more than my life as a standup comedian. When I’m on stage, I can’t deliver a D-grade-worthy performance, and nor do I want to – in the age of social media, a bad gig in Catford could end up on TikTok in Cambodia.That’s why whether it’s an open mic, a TV gig or screwing together a broken hip in an operating theatre, I’m aiming for A- and A*-quality performances each and every time. Like Miss T, I’ve already got my GCSEs – but I still see the value in fixing up, every day.Michael Akadiri is an award-winning standup comedian and junior doctor.

A recent study in the UKfound thatmore than a quarter of children encounter porn online before the age of 11. In the US,studies showthe average age of first exposure to online porn is 12, with some encountering it earlier. For many parents, that knowledge can spark panic: “What if this is the first place my child learns about sex? What if they think that’s what real intimacy looks like?”Here’s the good news: you don’t need to panic, but you do need to prepare. The truth is, your child will be exposed to ideas about sex, whether through peers, media or yes, pornography. And it will happen – long before you’d ideally want it to. The most protective factor isn’t monitoring phones or giving lectures. It’s you showing up as an honest, calm and approachable parent.Here’s an approach to make the conversation less intimidating.Set the stageFirst, set the stage for yourself. If you start from fear: (“Oh no, my child might see this terrible thing!”), the conversation will probably be shut down quickly. But if you ground yourself, it changes everything.Think about the bigger picture.Pornographyis not going away. Equipping your child to understand what they see and to ask questions is far more effective than pretending it doesn’t exist.Start with your valuesBefore talking about porn, take a moment to reflect on what youdowant your child to know about sex and relationships. Do you want them to value consent? To understand that intimacy is about connection, not just performance? To know that their bodies (and other people’s bodies) deserve care and dignity?Rooting the conversation in your family’s values shifts the focus from “don’t watch this” to “here’s what we believe about relationships – and why porn doesn’t offer that”. It usually shows a very narrow version of sex. One that skips over communication, respect or even mutual pleasure.Explain what porn is (and what it isn’t)There is a wide spectrum of adult content, including work that’s ethical and respectful. But most of what young people stumble across online isn’t that. It’s mainstream porn, which often misrepresents sex and relationships.The key here is to use language that matches your child’s age and developmental stage. For tweens, a simple definition works: “Porn is when people make videos or pictures of sex to sell online.” For teens, you might add: “It’s entertainment, like a movie, but it misrepresents relationships, emotions and sex itself.”The main point: porn is entertainment, not sex education.Keep it open and shame-freeMany parents worry: “If I talk about porn, won’t it make my child want to watch it?” Talking about porn doesn’t spark curiosity, it builds critical thinking. Kids are already exposed to sexual content through media, jokes and the internet. Silence doesn’t protect them, it just leaves them figuring it out alone.This is where being “askable” comes in. If your child knows they can come to you with a question (even an awkward, cringe-inducing one) and not get shut down, they’re far more likely to seek your guidance in the future. That means resisting the urge to overreact when the subject comes up. A deep breath, a calm tone, and phrases such as:● “That’s a good question, let’s talk about it.”● “I’m glad you asked me instead of just Googling it.”● “I don’t have all the answers, but we can figure it out together.”That’s the energy that makes you the go-to resource, not the last resort.Practical conversation startersMany parents just want to know what to say.Here are ways to start the conversation, depending on your child’s age, plus how to gauge where they’re at.Warm it up with a temperature checkAsk your child what they already know or have heard.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It might show people’s bodies and sexual stuff, but not what real relationships look like. If you ever see something that makes you uncomfortable, you can tell me.”● Teens:“You might hear about porn from friends, or even see it yourself. Just so you know, it’s made to be entertainment, not education. Real sex involves communication, consent, and care – things mainstream porn usually skips.”● For any age:“I know this can feel awkward, but I’d rather we talk about it together than leave you to figure it out alone.”Keep the conversation goingThe goal isn’t covering everything at once. It’s about creating an ongoing dialogue so your child knows your door is open and their questions won’t be met with judgment or punishment. Small, honest conversations over time are what stick.Final thought: you don’t need to know everythingHere’s a secret most kids wish their parents knew: what they want is reassurance, honesty and openness. Saying, “I don’t know, but I’ll find out,” models lifelong learning and lets your child know that questions are safe in your home.Talking about porn may never feel comfortable, but that’s OK.

There are many more substantial grounds that render him patently unqualified to receive the award.Among the numerous reasons that make him one of the least deserving people in the world who should be honored, he has single-handedly destroyed the United States Agency for International Development, which has saved hundreds of millions of people from hunger and disease, and promoted democracy and the rule of law around the world. In anexecutive orderissued on his inauguration day, 20 January, Trump slandered USAID as “not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values” and claimed that its workers “serve to destabilize world peace”.That act of malice by itself should be sufficient to erase Trump from the longest long list.Clearly, the worthiest candidate for the Nobel peace prize, whether its name was submitted before the deadline or not, is USAID. Since its founding under John F Kennedy in 1961, USAID has supported extensive programs on global health, food security, education and democratic development that, by addressing the root causes of instability and poverty, had promoted a more free, peaceful and prosperous world for 64 years until Trump destroyed it.As a general rule, there should be no shame attached to an organized effort to win the prize by Trump or others. Trump’s lobbying, though, is stained, as is much else about him, by perverse statecraft that has fostered conflict where none previously existed and his unquenchable need for cult-like worship.Several world leaders, such as Benjamin Netanyahu, have written in support of Trump’s nomination at his behest, cynically calculating that it would curry favor for their own often nefarious and warlike purposes. Trump personallypressuredIndia’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, to write a letter based on the lie that it was Trump who had “solved” a recent military conflict with Pakistan. Modi was alienated by the improper request. After his refusal to submit a false statement, Trump imposed a 50% tariff on India, which sent Modi flying into the arms of China. There is no existing international prize for this sort of willfully destructive behavior.The encomiums from Trump’s closest aides hailing him as the best candidate are symptoms of the sycophancy that is the eternal mark of authoritarian regimes. Fitting the historical pattern, obsequiousness within a cult of personality substitutes for honesty, fact and evidence. Trump punishes and purges forthright counsel, suppresses factual intelligence and expert information that is not falsified or distorted to achieve predetermined results, and dismisses evidence regarding medicine, the environment and energy derived from the scientific method.The tenor of unctuous servility was perfectly voiced by Steven Witkoff, Trump’s all-purpose international representative, speaking at an August cabinet meeting. “There’s only one thing I wish for,” hesaid, “that the Nobel committee finally gets its act together and realizes that you are the single finest candidate since this Nobel award was ever talked about.”The phrasing of Witkoff’s praise is eerily reminiscent of the words uttered in the 1962 filmThe Manchurian Candidateby the character of Major Ben Marco, played by Frank Sinatra, who has been brainwashed as a prisoner of war held by the North Koreans. He repeats over and over again his admiration for an army sergeant from his unit who has been programmed to be a political assassin on behalf of both the communists and the American far right. “Raymond Shaw,” says Major Marco, “is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.” In the movie, Shaw is awarded a prize – the Congressional Medal of Honor – based on the brainwashed testimony of his fellow soldiers.“No matter what I do, they won’t give it up and I’m not politicking for it,” Trumpsaid. He suggested the efforts to grant him the prize were spontaneous: “I have a lot of people that are.” When he was handed a nomination letter that Netanyahu had submitted, Trump said: “They will never give me a Nobel peace prize. I deserve it.”But Trump’s ludicrous hypocrisy about not pulling levers behind the curtain to solicit nomination also is not a conclusive reason to deny him the prize.Trump’s rancor about not receiving the prize that has not yet been awarded is exactly the same as his resentment that he did not get an Emmy for his reality TV show The Apprentice. For years heranted: “Should have gotten it.” “I got screwed out of an Emmy.” “The Emmys are all politics.” “Con game.” “Irrelevant.” Then, like the Emmy, he claimed the 2020 presidential election was “rigged” and organized an insurrection to overthrow the democratic result. In his paranoid chain of things wrongly denied him, now it’s the Nobel. Fill in the blank.Trump’s longing for the prize also reflects his anger that Barack Obama received it. Trump’sanimusagainst Obama about the Nobel followed his viciously contrived birther campaign. “Affirmative action,” said Trump. “Rigged.” “He had no idea why he got it.” “If I were named Obama, I would have had the Nobel prize given to me in 10 seconds.”The diplomatic and political friction that Trump has gratuitously produced between the US and Norway with his offensive remarks should also not be the decisive issue that affects the judgment of the committee. In 2018, Trumpsaid: “Why do we want all these people from Africa here? They’re shithole countries … We should have more people from Norway.” His comment evoked nationwide disgust in Norway. “On behalf of Norway: thanks, but no thanks,”tweeteda politician representing Norway’s Conservative party.Trump’s recent15% tarifflevied on Norway, despite its insignificant trade deficit, has damaged its fishing industry. His antipathy toward renewable forms of energy, throwing the entire wind power industry into chaos, hascostthe Norwegian state-owned energy company Equinor, which had an ongoing wind project off New York, about $1bn. In July, Trumpcalledthe Norwegian finance minister, Jens Stoltenberg, the former head of Nato, “out of the blue”. “He wanted the Nobel prize – and to discuss tariffs,” a Norwegian newspaper reported. But none of these offensive, obnoxious and even malign actions should be dispositive in whether Trump receives the prize.The reasons for denying him the award are much more fundamental and salient. His disqualification for the Nobel is not that he an inveterate liar, transparent faker and bungling schemer. It is that he meets other much more germane and dangerous criteria that were engraved for humankind epochs before the peace prize was ever conceived.Within mere months since reassuming office Trump has become a harbinger across the globe of war, famine, disease and death. The standards by which he should be judged are those described in theBook of Revelation(6:1–8) by the appearance of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Trump rides or presumes to ride all of those dreaded emblems of destruction, which do not foretell any glorious coming of peace, a new heaven and new earth, or prophesy a cleansing moment for repentance, but instead carnage followed by dictatorship and plagues without end.Specifically, rather than biblically, Trump has been an enabler of war. By his actions, he has supported Netanyahu’s offensive war for the complete ethnic cleansing and destruction of Gaza. Through his refusal to put conditions on $17.8bn in military assistance, Trump has made it possible for Netanyahu to ignore the advice of the Israeli army and intelligence leadership not to continue and expand that war.Trump hascalledfor the US to “take over” and “own” Gaza to turn it into a “Riviera of the Middle East”. This entity would generate profits through a US-led trusteeship, private investment in mega-construction projects and the “voluntary” relocation of Palestinians. Trump has held a White House meeting about aplandubbed the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation Trust – or “Great Trust” – that envisions building the “Gaza Trump Riviera and Islands” and the “Elon Musk Manufacturing Zone” and paying Palestinians $5,000 to relocate. Under this plan, Trump would personally profit in violation of the emoluments clause of the constitution.On Ukraine, Trump initially agreed to the European proposal for a ceasefire that would result in new sanctions if Vladimir Putin did not comply. But as soon as he was face to face with Putin at their summit in Alaska, Trumpcrumbledto take Putin’s side. The consequence has been the intensification of Russian bombing of Ukrainian civilian targets – as well as the European Union headquarters in Kyiv. Trump’s undermining of the ceasefire initiative was his latest gesture toward Putin of admiration and deference.The Trump White House hassaidit will “not rule out” military action to seize Greenland, a semi-independent territory of Denmark, a Nato member. Meanwhile, Denmark reports that Trump has deployed political personnel close to the White House to Greenland to agitate for a US takeover and to prepare for possible US military operations there. On 28 August, Denmark’s foreign ministersummonedthe top US diplomat to warn the Trump administration against its covert influence operation.Trump has repeatedly laid claim to the territory of the Panama Canal Zone andthreatenedto use military force to seize it. These threats were apparently made in part to pressure the government of Panama to reduce or eliminate the bill for taxes on Trump Organization properties that they were accused of evading there. In 2017, a joint Reuters-NBC News investigationreportedthat the Trump Ocean Club International hotel and tower in Panama City was a front for international money laundering for narcotics trafficking, dubbed Narco-a-Lago. The Trump Organization asserted it bore no responsibility for the activity within its units.Trump has also repeatedly laidclaimto the entire nation of Canada, another Nato member, to be occupied by and added to the United States as a single state. The White House has refused to rule out the use of military force for that purpose.On 21 June, Trump ordered Operation Midnight Hammer, a surprise, coordinated air strike on Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, Isfahan and other locations. The mission involved B-2 bombers dropping massive ordnance penetrator (MOP) “bunker buster” bombs on the Fordow site and other weapons against the other facilities. When Lt Gen Jeffrey Kruse, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, reported a preliminary intelligence assessment that Iran’s nuclear capability had not been “obliterated”, as Trump had boasted, he was summarilyfired.Trump has claimed to have brokered a peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia, after the parties came to the White House for a ceremony to sign a peace treaty. Both governments, however, subsequently acknowledged that this was apublicity stuntdesigned to help Trump with his campaign for the peace prize and thatno peace agreementwas actually concluded.Trump’s claim to have brokered a peace agreement between India and Pakistan was yet another stunt to burnish his credentials for the prize. When he was snubbed by Modi, Trump used it as a pretext for imposing a punitive tariff. His claim to have brokered a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the withdrawal of Rwandan forces from DRC soil was similarlyfalse. Rwanda-controlled M23 rebels remain on DRC soil, committingmassacresin 14 villages in July, and the peace agreement is a fiction.Trump has also enabled the Netanyahu government’s campaign of famine against the population of Gaza, granting Netanyahu impunity for his starvation project, while ordering the US representative to the United Nationsnot to signa statement from all 14 other members of the security council that the famine in Gaza is a “man-made crisis” and in violation of international law.A huge famine also rages in Sudan, connected in significant part to the proxy war fought there by a US ally, the United Arab Emirates. Trump’s decision to stop all USAID relief operations as part of his administration’s wholesale demolition of the agency has made the Sudan famine far more acute. As a result, more than 80% of emergency food kitchens have shut down. The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and theInternational Rescue Committee (IRC)have stated that the funding cuts are directly contributing to deaths from starvation and disease. The NRCwarnedthat inaction has allowed Sudan’s crisis to worsen “beyond measure”.Besides creating the conditions for famine, Trump’s decision to terminate USAID could lead to more than 14 million additional preventable deaths globally by 2030, according to an authoritative July 2025studyin the British medical journal the Lancet – “a staggering number of avoidable deaths”.According to the report, “USAID funding was associated with a 65% reduction in mortality from HIV/Aids (representing 25.5 million deaths), 51% from malaria (8 million deaths), and 50% from neglected tropical diseases (8.9 million deaths)”, among significant decreases in many other diseases. But Trump has wiped out all these programs.At home, Trump has eviscerated the National Institutes for Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and withheld $2.6bn from Harvard University in federal funds including for medical research on cancer and other diseases. After an armed man with a semi-automatic rifle opposed to vaccines fired 150 rounds into the CDC headquarters in Atlanta and murdered a police officer, Trump said absolutely nothing. He has been a stalwart against any restriction on guns, which are almost without exception the weapons used in school massacres, mass shootings and violent crime.“I looked,” reads the Book of Revelation, “and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death.”Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

The government was not announcing new legislation – it was justconfirmingthat it would reverse Lords amendments weakening the bill it introduced last year.The amendments,welcomed by business lobbies, had stripped out protections such as “day one” rights against unfair dismissal, and softened restrictions onfire-and-rehire. Reinstating the original provisions is the bare minimum that could be expected of a Labour government. But instead the mundane is spun by Downing Street as a transformative win.And this illustrates a deeper problem: a government that promised bold economic change is reduced to theatre. The fear at the Trades Union Congress is that a once-ambitious bill has been weakened and, after the exit ofAngela Rayner and her team, is now dependent on secondary legislation controlled by ministers no longer sympathetic to its original aims.Labour insists it was elected to rebuild Britain – but it currently looks like a government content with tweaking the status quo while the rest of the country waits for real change. As a former minister, Louise Haigh,arguedon Monday, Labour can’t renew Britain while trapped in the old framework. Real fiscal freedom isn’t a luxury – it’s a democratic duty. Blaming the Tories or deferring to the Office for Budget Responsibility no longer cuts it with voters. As Ms Haigh correctly reasons, Labour’s success demands breaking the rules that have stifled political ambition.That’s why the deputy leadership contest matters – and why the way it’s being stage-managed speaks volumes. Any MP wanting to stand has a few days to collect about80 signatures. The left will struggle to muster a candidate as eight of its MPs are suspended. There appears no time for a real campaign or meaningful debate. Which may be the point. But if Labour fears internal argument, how can it claim to renew democracy?Without a contest of ideas, Labour risks becoming a technocratic shell just when voters are demanding bold, emotionally resonant alternatives. Labour may want to avoid an argument in public about its shortcomings over the past year. But the party is leaking support not just to Reform UK, but to the Liberal Democrats and Greens. More will be lost to aleftwing partyled by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana. The combinedLabour-Conservativeshare is at a historic low. A fragmented electorate is searching for meaning – and if Labour cannot offer it, others will.This is why the new LabourMainstreamnetwork matters. Backed by the influential Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, and with broad support across the party, it is a serious attempt to re-anchor the party’s economic strategy in a broader democratic project. One of Mainstream’s key backers, Compass’s Neal Lawson,arguesthat Labour should define the role of deputy leader before debating candidates. That would have been a good start.A real contest could give voice to Labour’s base – north to south, centre to left. It may force a rethink of unpopular policies onbenefitsandGaza. It would show the party isn’t afraid of debate. And it could empower a deputy leader who speaks for neglected constituencies: the north, women and working‑class voters. Labour is leaking voters across the spectrum. It cannot afford, surely, to look like a party afraid of its own members.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Charging international students more for less will not fix deep-seated problemsMon 8 Sep 2025 13.55 EDTLast modified on Mon 8 Sep 2025 14.19 EDTShareIt is a year since Sir Keir Starmer said that “crumbling” universitieswere in a worse statethan Labour realised before the election. But having failed to come up with a meaningful plan to fix them, ministers now risk further harm. Changes to visa rules and anew levyon international student fees threaten to undermine the sector – with alarming knock-on effects in places where universities play an especially important economic and cultural role.This is the main theme of a new report from the Centre for Cities. It points to towns and cities, mostly outside the south-east and including Plymouth and Hull, where universities have anoutsize role in economic activity. In places such as Exeter and Dundee (where the university recently received a£40m bailoutfrom the Scottish government), international student fees make universities the biggest exporters of services. The message to ministers is to pay attention to such connections. Economic growth and higher education policies need to be joined up.Themess of university financeslong predates this government. It was New Labour’s decision to fund the expansion of places by introducing fees, and indebting the next generation. The Tories were in favour of market mechanisms and allowed the value of fees to stagnate. They lowered the income threshold from which loans must be repaid but declined to fill the gap on university balance sheets. The sector’s heavy reliance on international student fees was the result. These now add up to a quarter of all revenue – up from 5% 30 years ago.There are problems with this funding model, among them thequestionable ethicsof students from poorer countries subsidising the education of young Britons. But Brexit, international competition and regulations designed to cut immigration (by preventing students from bringing family members), have all harmed UK universities’ ability to attract students. Now, the Home Office plans to contact 130,000 international students and warn them against overstaying, orlodging asylum claims that lack “merit”– in what it says is an attempt to crack down on abuses.Objections to such measures go beyond their impact on universities. Attempts to make the UK a less welcoming destination are part of an alarming rightward lurch on immigration by the government. But given that the UK has encouraged its higher education sector to maximise exports currentlyestimated to be worth £23bnby drawing in foreign students, the impact of this reversal on them needs to be addressed.For universities it’s made worse because domestic student numbers peaked in 2021-22, and employer national insurance increases will more than cancel out the extra revenue from a smallrise in tuition fees. The proposed levy on international student fees will further reduce income unless fees rise – although ministers say receipts will be reinvested.TheCentre for Cities’ workis valuable because it reminds us that universities are not ivory towers. As well as being home to libraries and laboratories, they are civic hubs with myriad ties to the towns and cities in (or near) which they are based. The collapse of any one of them would have severe consequences beyond its formal boundaries. This is not to say that nothing needs to change. About lifelong learning, universities must develop new ideas. But it is difficult to build on crumbling foundations. It’s time ministers explain how, and when, they will mend them.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Achieving positions of influence in our society is less about merit and more about connections, accent and so on – all acquired at fee‑paying schools.The ethics adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, said that Ms Rayner “acted with integrity and with a dedicated and exemplary commitment to public service”, unlike some. In the unlikely event that you are from humble beginnings and emulate the achievement of Rayner, know that some privately educated newspaper columnists will be ruthless in their pursuit of you, because you are not one of them.Dr Robin C RichmondBromyard, HerefordshireI am filled with sadness at Angela Rayner’s resignation.

As someone from the squeezed middle, I work hard, live modestly and make careful choices. We share one car, skip holidays and stretch every pound. I haven’t ruled out having another child – but the cost of living makes it feel increasingly out of reach.I agree no child should go hungry. But we must also ask: is it fair to expect taxpayers to subsidise larger families when many of us limit our own because we simply can’t afford more? If we remove all boundaries, where does that leave those of us who plan carefully and still struggle?I see families doing their best, but I also see choices that make me wonder where personal accountability fits in. The two-child benefit cap isn’t perfect, but it’s a line in the sand. Without it, we risk deepening inequality – not just between rich and poor but between those who live within their means and those who don’t. We need compassion, but also fairness. And fairness means recognising that hard-working families like mine are already stretched.Elizabeth JosephPortsmouthArchbishop Stephen Cottrell and your readership should be aware that child poverty is not “soaring”. To our collective shame, through a succession of administrations, child poverty has remained at around the 30% mark for decades.Povertylevels are a political choice and child poverty is a particular scar on the UK’s political policymaking.The collective shame is that the scale of child poverty is known, its persistence over 50 years has been monitored, the harm inflicted is well documented and affordable solutions are known. The hesitation over ending the two-child benefit cap should count as an embarrassment in England when in Scotland there is the Scottish child payment to low-income families, begun in 2021, with payments currently at £27.15 per week.Carl ParsonsGreenwich, LondonI was reassured by the article from the archbishop of York. For 12 years I volunteered with a local charity that provided advice, play schemes and, latterly, food parcels to families in insecure housing. These parcels became more and more crucial each year.We helped some of the most impoverished families, those on “no recourse to public funds”, subsisting on less than £40 a week per child and nothing for adults. This project has now had to close for lack of funds. For a comprehensive child-poverty strategy, the government has to consider not only its direct policies but funding to the local authorities that clear up after national provision fails.Ruth ValentineLondonI read with dismay and disbelief that families living in poverty, earning less than £9,518 will not be eligible for free childcare (Poorer families may not benefit as 30 hours free childcare begins in England, experts say, 1 September) and yet parents earning up to £100,000 a year are eligible. Who on earth thinks this is a suitable policy for children already living in poverty?Surely, as the archbishop writes, it is in all our interests that all children have a fair start in life. It is well known that children deprived in early life never catch up on their better-resourced peers. No wonder support is draining away from this Labour government.Helen KayEdinburghHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I too joined every waiting list in Glasgow before I became a plotholder. There are not enough allotments in Glasgow and indeed across the UK. While the company Roots and other private allotments have a place, they can never be a replacement for local authority ones. Under the 2015 Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act, Scottish local authorities have a duty to provide allotments. We need to find more space in our cities for them – spaces that have been proven to improve mental and physical health, at an affordable price.In 1932, theScottish allotment scheme for the unemployedwas created. Plots were provided, as well as grants for seeds and tools. The scheme was not just to provide a place for growing food but also seen as preventing a mental health crisis, even though that would not have been said at the time. Plots were found on existing allotment sites, but the scheme also worked with local authorities to create new sites.We call on allotments in times of crisis, and I believe our plot got me, my husband and our baby through the Covid lockdowns. It gave us a safe outside place beyond our flat to go to.The value of allotments needs to be recognised by the government. If we could find extra land in the 1930s, surely we can do it now without the need of expensive companies.Dr Hannah ConnellyHullHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Nuno’s departure just three games into the season comes after the emergence of tensions with the owner, Evangelos Marinakis, over the past fortnight.“Nottingham Forest Football Club confirms that, following recent circumstances, Nuno Espírito Santo has today been relieved of his duties as head coach,” said a club statement in the early hours of Tuesday morning.“The club thanks Nuno for his contribution during a very successful era at the City Ground, in particular his role in the 2024-25 season, which will forever be remembered fondly in the history of the club.“As someone who played a pivotal role in our success last season, he will always hold a special place in our journey.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Nuno confirmed before August’s Premier League match at Crystal Palace, thathis relationship with Marinakishad deteriorated over the summer. “I cannot say that is the same, because it’s not the same,” Nuno said. “The reason behind it, I don’t know … I think everybody at the club should be together but it’s not the reality.”Nuno’s tenure at the City Ground was highly successful, the Portuguese steering Forest to safety in his first season after replacing Steve Cooper in December 2023. The following season, he led the team on an unexpected push for Champions League qualification, spending much of the campaign in the top four.Forest finished seventh, securing a Conference League spot which became a Europa League place whenCrystal Palace were demoted by Uefa.The former Tottenham manager Postecoglou is reportedly a frontrunner to succeed Nuno.

In this huge success that the whole world saw, he promoted Greece,” Marinakis said when presenting him with an award in Greece following his Europa League triumph.“We must thank him especially for this and we wish him well, although we are sure that he will do well as he has the ability. Wherever he goes, the successes will come.”Having led the club into Europe, Nuno departs the City Ground as the club’s most successful manager since Frank Clark, and they sit 10th in the Premier League table.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestnewsShareReuse this content"

The football has been uninspired at times – England underwhelmed in attack during their2-0 victory over Andorraat Villa Park last Saturday – but Tuchel believes facing Serbia in a ferocious atmosphere can ignite his reign.“It is always the opportunity and I’ll always see it like this,” the German said. “This game is the opportunity and I think it will bring out the best in us that we are here in Belgrade.”Harry Kane and Tuchel both mentioned the intimidating nature of the tunnel, which is the longest in Europe at 240 metres. “The tunnel is not so agreeable,” Tuchel said. “But that’s what it’s all about now. It’s nice, you’re in this country, this sporting nation, full of emotional people, full of quality in every sport – especially in sports that have a ball.“They are so talented and determined. That’s the beauty of it and if you want to go to a World Cup and to play for the national team, experiencing this is the beauty. Tomorrow is one of these nights. And we’re up for it.”England, who top the group by five points, are missing a host of key players and are short on experience. There could be anotherstart in midfield for Elliot Anderson, who impressed on hisdebutagainst Andorra, while Morgan Rogers, Tino Livramento, Morgan Gibbs-White and Myles Lewis-Skelly do not have many caps between them. Yet Tuchel, who said that Marc Guéhi has shaken off the groin issue that forced him off against Andorra, believes his players will rise to the occasion.“Afraid of nothing,” Tuchel said. “The group was excellent throughout the week and everyone deserves to play. It is good, we have some difficult choices and some narrow decisions to make. We will have a strong bench and age is not decisive.”Tuchel hopes that Jordan Henderson can play a vital leadership role even if the veteran midfielder is not in the starting lineup. “Jordan has played here, Harry [Kane] has played here and they have talked already about it,” he said. “The spectators will be emotional, they will be loud.”View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel is missing a host of key players for the match against Serbia.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APThe expectation is that England will face another deep five-man defence.

I think it has been an excellent camp with an excellent group. They are all very confident and eager to play.”This is England’s first trip to Belgrade since facing the old Yugoslavia in 1987. Tuchel’s players have held a meeting about the possibility of racist abuse from the crowd. The stadium’s capacity has been reduced by 15% because of fan behaviour whenSerbiafaced Andorra in June.Branko Radujko, general secretary of the Football Association of Serbia, has used his programme notes to urge spectators not to spoil tonight’s occasion.“In addition to the spectacle we expect on the pitch, let me draw attention to something just as important: behaviour of all of us in the stands,” he said. “This match of truth also carries great responsibility.“We are still under special monitoring of Uefa.

Job done on that front, with four points out of six a wholly acceptable return. The visit of Greece to Hampden Park next month is hugely significant.The stodginess of Scotland’s display before Ché Adams nudged them in front against Belarus ultimately proved irrelevant. Belarus lacked the nous and guile to inflict a bloody nose on Scotland. Still, recent struggles against packed defences meant nobody of Scottish persuasion could rest entirely easy until a 65th-minute own goal was added to the Adams effort. Greek success and acomfortable one in Glasgowin March serves as a warning. Still, the Scots would have readily taken this position and opportunity before a Group C ball was kicked. Back-to-back clean sheets to start the campaign bodes well. This looks like a robust, well-drilled team once again.Belarus 0-2 Scotland: World Cup 2026 qualifying Group C – live reactionRead more“It is a good start but it is only a start,” said theScotlandmanager Steve Clarke. “Four points will never qualify anybody for anything. It is nice to go home with smiles on our faces but I am already thinking about next month.”Scotland’s showing during thescoreless draw in Copenhagenon Friday, coupled with Belarus’s 5-1 thrashing at the hands of Greece, placed the Tartan Army in that historically dangerous position of holding great expectation. Deepest Hungary and a closed doors scenario conjured memories of Covid times, during which Scotland qualified for their first tournament since 1998. The wait for a World Cup appearance, though, stretches back to that very year.In accordance with the variation in task, Clarke freshened up his team. Ben Gannon-Doak was one of four changes to the Scottish starting XI as Clarke sought increased cutting edge.Belarusswitched eight as they sought to improve on a record of just three wins in 28 World Cup qualifiers.The first quarter of the game was so hectic as to belie the lack of atmosphere. Gannon-Doak in combination with Andy Robertson carried Scotland’s main threat on the left side.The Scotland manager looked rightly irritated, however, that his team was not creating clearcut opportunities. Max Johnston broke that mould with a cross poked wide by Scott McTominay in the 29th minute. McTominay soon screamed in vain for a penalty; Yegor Parkhomenko’s unpunished challenge occurred outside the box in any case.View image in fullscreenZakhar Volkov heads past his own goalkeeper to double Scotland’s lead.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAAngus Gunn spared his Scotland teammates red faces before the interval. Johnston, whose defensive attributes are open to question, simply stopped in allowing Max Ebong to maraud through on goal. Gunn saved with his feet at his near post from the Astana man. The Scots heeded the warning. Billy Gilmour responded with a long-range attempt that Fedor Lapoukhov fumbled on to the woodwork. A terrific John McGinn cross found the head of McTominay, who placed the ball on a plate for Adams. The 29-year-old notched his 10th Scotland goal from all of three yards. Two minutes before the break, Scotland had their crucial advantage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead – and incredibly – the referee issued only a yellow card to Vladislav Kalinin for a wild lunge on Lewis Ferguson. Equally incomprehensible was the failure of the video assistant referee to at least send Nikola Dabanovic towards a monitor. Even before modern day sanitisation of tackling, this was a sending-off offence. McTominay should have diminished the significance of the incident but sent a free header straight into Lapoukhov’s hands from 12 yards.Just when it seemed the biggest threat to Scotland was their own impatience, their lead was doubled. This was the strangest of things, a fine team goal converted by an opponent. Robertson fed Gilmour, who played inside to Adams. Gilmour’s run in breaking from midfield was perfectly timed, allowing Adams to complete the one-two. Gilmour’s headed cross was bound for the head of McTominay, causing Zakhar Volkov to panic and nod beyond his own goalkeeper. Scotland had the leeway they craved and a two-goal margin the increasingly blunt Belarus side looked incapable of overhauling. Attention now turned towards Athens, where Denmark were swaggering to a surprising win.Adams should have claimed his second but delayed his angled shot, allowing Pavel Zabelin to clear from the goalline. A raft of substitutions had removed what little tempo there was in the fixture. Clarke had no reason to care about that. Hampden on 9 October should be quite the spectacle. Another win would send Scotland halfway towards their promised land.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersScotlandBelarusmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

As part of the settlement Manchester City accepts that the current APT rules are valid and binding. It has been agreed that neither the Premier League nor the club will be making any further comment about the matter.”City claimed victory in aninitial battle over APTin October, after an arbitration panel found that certain aspects of the rules which then stood were discriminatory. Loans made by shareholders to their own club should have been included within APT rules, the panel adjudged, while there were also problems with the way in which clubs were given information on what might be “fair market value” in any given deal.After making adjustments to accommodate the panel’s ruling, the Premier League argued that any problems over APT had been resolved and its rulebook fit for purpose. City challenged the league’s adjustments, however, and begana new process of arbitrationthis year. It is this second process which has now been resolved. Both parties, however, remain involved in the lengthy and secretive disciplinary process in which the club have been hit with more than130 charges of breaking the Premier League’s rulebook.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Rather than dwelling on the pain oflosing his US Open titleand No 1 ranking, he was thinking about the future.Sinner felt his game was too predictable, even one-dimensional, compared with Alcaraz, whose deep toolbox of shots left him uncomfortable and unable to find rhythm on the court. As a result of that discomfort, Sinner made a decision. The 24-year-old resolved to make significant changes to his game in pursuit of becoming a better, more complete tennis player and keeping up with his rival, even if he might suffer in the short term.Carlos Alcaraz savours ‘best tournament’ of his career after claiming second US Open titleRead more“I’m going to aim to maybe even lose some matches from now on, but trying to do some changes trying to be a bit more unpredictable,” Sinner said. “Because I think that’s what I have to do, trying to become a better player.”It was a remarkable admission, particularly considering Sinner’s own dominance in recent years. Over the past 52 weeks, the Italian holds a 51-1 record against opponents not named Alcaraz and is 74-1 against everyone but Alcaraz on hard courts since November 2023. He has spent the past two years destroying opponents, compiling 65 consecutive weeks at No 1. However, Alcaraz has now won seven of their past eight meetings. Only one player has forced him to make those changes.This is firstly a reflection of his Spanish opponent’s greatness, already one of the best players in the game’s history, whose career continues to move at a historic pace. Hisfirst grand slam title at the US Openestablished him as the first teenage ATP No 1 in history, and now with his second success in New York he is the second‑youngest man to win six majors. At 22, he is also the fourth man to win multiple major titles on all three surfaces. He still has so much room for improvement.Unlike most of his other triumphs, there were no rollercoaster battles against lesser opponents or seemingly impossible comebacks against his toughest adversaries. He simply performed at a supreme level throughout the tournament, dropping his only set of the fortnight to Sinner. He was sublime in the final, letting rip with his forehand, which dictated the baseline exchanges throughout.His peerless defensive abilities made the court feel so small for Sinner and, as the losing finalist admitted, his variety of shot just makes the Italian uncomfortable. “I feel I can do everything on court, to be honest: slices, drop shots, topspin, flat,” Alcaraz said.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz with his team and family after defeating Jannik Sinner in New York.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty ImagesOne of the most significant factors in his success was his serve. For a long time, Alcaraz’s serve was the one ordinary part of his game. It was imprecise and inconsistent, particularly on important points, making it vulnerable against the best players. Alcaraz won his first US Open in spite of his serve, conceding 24 service games throughout the tournament. This time, he lost his serve just three times. Since 1991, only Pete Sampras at Wimbledon in 1997 has conceded fewer service games en route to a major title. It provided him with a platform for the rest of his game to flow and is a terrifying development for future opponents.Sinner’s response to his defeat also showed why these two players will continue to tower over the rest of the tour for years to come. Although he did not feel he needed to make such significant changes to his playing style, Alcaraz’s reaction tolosing against the Italian at Wimbledonwas similar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As was the case with Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic before them, their increasingly frequent battles will mould them into better players as long as they are both at the top of the game. There is no room for complacency.Although they had already split the previous five grand slams between them, ahead of the French Open, Alcaraz and Sinner had never faced each other in a major final. They have now become the first men in history tocontest three major finals in a calendar year. By New York, the prospect of a final between them felt inevitable, as if nothing but a freak injury or occurrence could stop it.Many things can happen in the future, but as things stand the gap is widening and for the rest of the players hoping to one day lift the biggest trophies in the sport, life is only becoming more complicated.Explore more on these topicsTennisJannik SinnerCarlos AlcarazUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bompastor could be seen remonstrating with the officials at the time and, after the game, she said: “For me, that’s not fair. It’s not in the rules. I mentioned that last season as well, with all the goalkeepers going down just for the coach to have a tactical stoppage to talk to the players. I’m not saying I will never use that, because I know that it can be part of a strategy, but tonight it was too much.

For the third goal it was Beth Mead and Stina Blackstenius combining, before Frida Maanum was the beneficiary of that pair’s buildup play for Arsenal’s fourth. All three had come off the bench against the WSL newcomers and with Arsenal competing on four fronts this season, that quality in depth will be critical. The head coach Renée Slegers said of her squad: “It’s early in the season, so we also had to manage a lot of things. We had to make good decisions with yellow cards and players’ fitness today, and that’s all taken into account. The players who start the game problem-solved, they had to create a team connection and the rhythm on the pitch, and then the players that finished the game when things were more open – it was brilliant today.”Suzanne WrackMatch report:Arsenal 4-1 London City LionessesView image in fullscreenFrida Maanum completes the scoring as Arsenal roared back from a goal down at the Emirates.Photograph: Alex Burstow/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesToone scores emotional goalElla Toone started the season where she left off in Switzerland, with an attacking performance that illustrated how she continues to return to her best after a difficult 12 months. It was perhaps inevitable that she would score on the anniversary of her father Nick’s death, adding extra emotion to her 13th-minute opener against Leicester. Toone was integral to Manchester United’s dominant 4-0 victory against disjointed opponents, pulling the strings in behind Elisabeth Terland and providing the assist for Melvine Malard’s second goal. Toone registered 100 touches on the ball, the second-highest of anyone on the pitch and could have had a hat-trick. It was a routine opening-day win for Marc Skinner’s side, who showed the benefits of having already played competitive football this season in Champions League qualification.Sophie DowneyEverton hot-shot Vignola stuns AnfieldStanding in the mixed zone holding the match ball, even Ornella Vignola seemed a little bemused by what had just happened. One thing’s for certain: the smile will not be leaving her face any time soon. The 20-year-old announced herself in style after her move from Granada this summer, becoming the first Everton player to score a hat-trick in a Merseyside derby for 94 years. “She was superb and she has been like that in training,” her delighted manager, Brian Sørensen, said. “Her runs are so well-timed and the way she faces up and goes at players, she is excellent. She just wants to score.” The Blues cemented their dominance in this fixture with a 4-1 comeback victory, their fourth straight win against Liverpool and their sixth from six at Anfield.SDMatch report:Liverpool 1-4 Evertonskip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Spurs are delighted that the Japan centre-back chose to join them from Feyenoord this summer amid interest from Champions League sides. The new Tottenham head coach, Martin Ho, believes Koga can be a star. “For a 19-year-old she’s very mature. She’s well above her years in terms of football and personally,” Ho said. “That’s just a snippet of what Toko can do. We’ve only been working with her for the last five or six weeks and I think, when you get six or seven months in, you’re going to see a real, talented player, and I believe probably one of the best in world football.”TGMatch report:Tottenham 1-0 West HamVilla keep Agyemang quiet“I’m proud because it is difficult to play a nice first game,” the Aston Villa manager, Natalia Arroyo, said after her side earned a point away to Brighton. This felt like a typical opening day fixture: a goalless draw between two sides who were separated by just three points last season. Both sides looked refreshed but lacked cohesion in a game that promised much but delivered little. The Seagulls will be the most disappointed with the outcome: Dario Vidosic’s team controlled possession, led in attacking statistics and made twice as many passes as their opponents, who defended resolutely. Finding that clinical edge will be the next step for Brighton: Michelle Agyemang, back on loan from Arsenal after a career-changing summer, led the line and hit the post but was otherwise marshalled well by the visitors.SDExplore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballArsenal WomenManchester United WomenEverton WomenChelsea WomenTottenham Hotspur WomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Sunday, after all, what had been down was suddenly up, what was bad became good, what was strong appeared feeble. And so the series ended having only really proved that what fails today can flourish tomorrow, which does not necessarily help with planning for the day after that.Clearly England have a team with great potential, but across the week it only really shone when their opponents had misplaced both motivation and quality. Brendon McCullum, the England head coach, described “an oscillating series” that concluded with “an incredible blueprint of what this team’s capable of achieving if we can get it right”, but if it is hard to argue that scoring 414 before routing your opponents for 72 is anything less than ideal it is also not hugely repeatable.England are ranked eighth in the format by the InternationalCricketCouncil and in 14 bilateral series since the end of 2021 they have won just one against the seven teams currently ranked above them, while being humbled both in the 2023 World Cup and in the Champions Trophy this year. One win, however emphatic, cannot expunge a troubling long-term record.Brendon McCullum labels upcoming Ashes as ‘biggest series of all of our lives’Read moreSince the Champions Trophy, Harry Brook has taken over as white-ball captain and one key change has been made to the team: Will Jacks and Jacob Bethell have come in, and with batting depth strengthened at the expense of bowling that pair are expected to combine for 10 overs. Across the summer their economy rates have been 8.80 and 9.06 respectively, with the team and their new captain still learning how to flex these muscles.“We’re going to need them to bowl some overs and we’ve got to be a bit smarter with it,” McCullum said. “Brooky and I had a chat about it the other day, just making sure we give that fifth bowler slightly more in their favour, making sure we’re utilising the big side of the ground or trying to maybe set more defensive fields. They don’t need to take three for 30 off 10 overs, they’ve just got to find a way to create pressure and hold for a period so our attacking guys can come in.”Attention now turns to T20s, with three matches against South Africa starting in Cardiff on Wednesday and a World Cup looming early next year – and though McCullum’s view is that “I don’t think there’s too much that separates the formats”, England’s squad is changing in a few interesting ways. The one-day international openers, Ben Duckett and Jamie Smith, are both being rested – “I’m in the racing game and not evenPhar Lapcould go around every week, even he needed to go to the paddock occasionally,” McCullum said – while Sam Curran, player of the tournament when England won the T20 World Cup in 2022 but out of favour for nearly a year, has been recalled.View image in fullscreenSam Curran (left) has been recalled to England’s T20 squad after impressing in the Hundred.Photograph: Philip Brown/Getty Images“The door’s never shut on anyone,” McCullum said. “I sat down with Sam at the start of the summer and had a good chat. He wanted to know where he was at and it was a really honest conversation. The message to Sam was that a lot’s come to you quickly and you’ve had a lot of success and a lot of fame and a lot of things have fallen your way, but of late your performance had just tailed off a bit. But if you can get back to demanding a position, go away and do that in franchise cricket and bang the door down, then his opportunity will come.” Twelve wickets and a couple of memorable innings in the Hundred – coupled with a batting average of 51.16 in the County Championship – has achieved that.On Sunday came the latest advance of another player for whom a lot has come quickly, with Bethell scoring his first senior century, 10 days before – still aged 21 – he becomes the youngest man to captain England, against Ireland in Malahide. “We’ve put him in that position because we feel he’s got leadership qualities and you’re always looking to give guys opportunities,” McCullum said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even in the era of racing on Polytrack and Tapeta, which dates back almost 40 years, there are occasional days when, to the delight of headline-writers, the so-called “all-weather” surfaces cannot cope.But there has never been a day throughout those decades when a scheduled programme of racing has been called off voluntarily, so the decision to“strike” on Wednesday, when meetings were due to be staged at Lingfield, Carlisle, Uttoxeter and Kempton, is a sign of how seriously racing’s administrators and stakeholders view the threat to the sport’s finances from a government proposal to “harmonise” the rate of duty charged on profits from betting on sport and other uncertain events, and fixed-margin casino products such as online slots where the operator takes a guaranteed percentage of turnover.Racing strike leads to battle lines being drawn in dispute over tax reforms | Greg WoodRead moreMartin Cruddace, the chief executive of Arena Racing Company, one of Britain’s two major racecourse operators alongside Jockey Club Racecourses, has described the proposal as representing an “existential threat” to Britain’s second-biggest spectator sport.That might seem a little overwrought given that the current rate of betting duty is 15% of an operator’s gross profits, while the rate for gaming products is 21%. Could an extra 6%, or even 10% alongside a 4% rise in gaming duty to “harmonise” at 25%, really make that much difference to an industry that generates billions of pounds in online turnover annually?The answer is yes, it could, and Wednesday’s strike, as well as an event at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre in London, not far from the Houses of Parliament, is the sport’s chance to get its message across before Rachel Reeves delivers her budget on 26 November.The fundamental problem with the harmonisation idea from racing’s point of view is that it would end the distinction between games of skill and games of pure chance in the legal and regulatory frameworks around gambling.It is a distinction that dates back to the late 1700s, which saw the emergence of both over-round bookmaking – which allows a bookie to offer odds on all the runners in a race – and the roulette wheel. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, betting involved bookmakers and gaming was restricted to casinos, a separation that remained after off-course betting in high-street shops was legalised in the early 1960s.Two significant developments started to break down the barriers in the early years of the 21st century. The internet brought casino gaming to every computer desktop and mobile phone, giving online operators the ability to cross-promote gaming to betting customers, while the 2005 Gambling Act legitimised high-stakes casino-gaming in every high-street shop in the country on so-called fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBT).But the distinction has – so far – endured in gambling’s taxation regime, and not simply because casino gaming and slots have a much higher correlation with problem gambling and addiction (although that link has been shown beyond any meaningful doubt).Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowNewton Abbot1.58Lord2.28Jack Hyde2.58La Quarite3.28Puddlesinthepark3.58Hope Rising4.30Juggernaut5.00Axel BleueCatterick Bridge2.10Stellarmasterpiece2.40Albegone3.10Maasai Mata3.40U Sure Do4.10Crocodile Power4.40Latona5.10Emerald ArmyLeicester 2.20Unplugged2.50Zanthos3.20Kalokalo3.50Monoceros4.25Harb4.55Brielle5.25LequintoCarlisle 4.14Isle Of Fernandez4.45Rum Therapy5.15Bella Love5.45Maris Angel (nap)6.15Sound Janet6.45Lunanova7.15One Night ThunderFfos Las 4.20She’s Crafty4.50Diamondsinthesand5.20Spanish Waltz5.55Tokyo Joe6.25Wyld Bill6.55Maxident (nb)7.25Golden PharaohWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It is also because gaming generates guaranteed profits, as a simple function of turnover. The profits from betting are far less certain, and demand much more effort and investment from the operators. The lower rate of duty on betting is an incentive to make that effort.Without it, there is no incentive to even maintain the betting side of an operator’s business, never mind grow it over time. Racing, the only major sport that derives an essential part of its income from a share of betting revenue, would be trapped in a slow, and inevitable, spiral of decline.There is still a debate to be had over whether racing’s “one voice” calling for the government to “axe the racing tax” should be more stridently anti-harmonisation, and less focused on opposing any rise in betting duty. My view would be that a small rise is inevitable in the current climate, but also that it could be a positive for racing if it comes alongside a much bigger hike in gaming duty. The National Trainers’ Federation is still the only industry body to have offered public support for a resolution along those lines.The strike on Wednesday is still an impressive show of unity in an entertainment industry that so often fractures into its constituent parts when times are hard, pitting the racecourses against the 10s of thousands of people who ensure that the show always goes on, on all but two or three days each year.Racing directly or indirectly supports 85,000 jobs around the country, while about 50 Labour MPs are sitting uneasily on a majority of 2,000 or below. If this week’s strike can introduce at least a few of the latter group to the urgent concerns of the former, it will be worth every penny of the £200k it is expected to cost the sport.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingTalking HorsesHorse racing tipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s easy enough to put yourself second at times like that.”“We want it for as long as possible and protecting the people includes the people doing the pit stops. It’s not a very nice feeling, I would imagine.”His opinion was wholeheartedly backed by Norris.“The team is priority No 1 and drivers second,” he said. “That’s how it works. It’s only our second year of fighting for wins but the team gives us these opportunities. Without the team, then we’re just fighting for 10th and none of us want that. The spirit of the team is priority and we are below that.”View image in fullscreenLando Norris, who took second place to Oscar Piastri’s third at Monza, now trails his teammate by 31 points in the drivers’ championship.Photograph: Joe Portlock/Getty ImagesWolff managed what became a fractious and bitter intra-team battle between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg in 2016 which he described at Monza this year as “two lions in the den” who were “at each other’s throats”, but was intrigued how the McLaren commitment to fair play between its drivers would play out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said the army’s failure to take appropriate action “more than minimally” contributed to her death.Leighann McCready, Beck’s mother, said the family was relieved that Webber had admitted his guilt.However, she added: “It’s hard to believe it has taken so long for there to be any accountability for this crime. Jaysley did everything right. She reported the assault immediately, not once but twice.“First to her captain, who dismissed and dissuaded her from going further. And even then, she went over his head and reported it up the chain. But her chain of command still failed her.“They did not do what the rules at the time required them to do – which was to report it to the police. If they had done that one simple thing, we believe with all our hearts she would still be with us today.”View image in fullscreenLeighann McCready said the military did not follow its own rules by failing to report the offence to the police.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAMcCready said her daughter lost faith that she would be believed or supported the next time she needed help – which she said was just a few weeks later when another senior male started harassing her too. “By this point she felt she had nowhere to turn.”McCready said even after the coroner’s findings, the family had to push for the assault to be treated as a crime. “The justice system shouldn’t work like this – whether civilian or military. It shouldn’t depend upon a grieving family pressing at every stage for investigations that should have been conducted right at the start when Jaysley first reported what had happened to her.“Like so many women, Jaysley simply was not believed and everything else flowed from that. Those failures cost her her life. Until the culture changes, service personnel will continue to be failed.”Emma Norton, the family’s solicitor, said: “What a difference it would have made if Jaysley’s chain of command had just listened when she told them about the assault the morning it happened and reported it to the police – instead of trying to persuade her that it wasn’t that serious, and to think about the impact on her assailant’s career and family.”The inquest heard Beck had made a complaint against Webber after the exercise in July 2021. She had said that he had “made a pass” at her, put his hand between her legs and “pinned her down” while trying to kiss her, the hearing was told.Beck, who joined the army at 16, had been left scared by the incident and ended up sleeping in her car for safety.After the inquest, the army said it should have done “so much more” to support and protect Beck. Webber has left the army.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

He says the company systematically violated cybersecurity regulations and retaliated against him for reporting the failures.Attaullah Baig, who served as head of security forWhatsAppfrom 2021 to 2025, claims that approximately 1,500 engineers had unrestricted access to user data without proper oversight, potentially violating a US government order that imposed a $5bn penalty on the company in 2020.He also claimed the company failed to remedy the hacking and takeover of more than 100,000 accounts each day, ignoring his pleas and proposed fixes and choosing instead to prioritize user growth. The lawsuit, filed in US federal court in San Francisco, alleges Facebook-ownerMetafailed to implement basic cybersecurity measures, including adequate data handling and breach detection capabilities.According to the 115-page complaint, Baig discovered through internal security testing that WhatsApp engineers could “move or steal user data” including contact information, IP addresses and profile photos “without detection or audit trail”.The filing claims Baig repeatedly raised concerns with senior executives, including the WhatsApp head, Will Cathcart, and Meta CEO,Mark Zuckerberg. Meta acquired Whatsapp for $19bn in 2014. The app now boasts three billion users, according to Meta.WhatsApp’s vice president of communications Carl Woog wrote in a statement, “Sadly this is a familiar playbook in which a former employee is dismissed for poor performance and then goes public with distorted claims that misrepresent the ongoing hard work of our team.”Baig alleges he faced escalating retaliation after his initial reports in 2021, including negative performance reviews, verbal warnings and ultimately termination in February 2025 for apparent “poor performance”.The company emphasized that Baig left due to poor performance, with multiple senior engineers independently validating that his work was below expectations. Meta noted in a statement that the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration dismissed Baig’s initial complaint, finding that it had not retaliated against him.Before joining Meta, Baig worked in cybersecurity roles at PayPal, Capital One and other major financial institutions.He filed complaints with federal regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission before pursuing the current litigation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It did not say how much the meal deals will cost.In the UK, meal deals will be tested across two parts of the day – a croissant and coffee for breakfast; crisps and a bread-based sandwich; and also any lunch main, snack and a drink.In January Pret launched a meal deal in France, which is performing well.“Going forward our priority will be to drive transactions and sustainable growth by offering great value for money for Pret customers,” said Pano Christou, the chief executive of Pret.Supermarkets and other high street retailers have long offered meal deals, offering a sandwich, snack and drink for a set price. These have been creeping up in price amidrising food inflation, with Tesco recentlyincreasing the price of its meal deal by 25pto £3.85 for Clubcard holders, its third increase since 2022.Pret’s parent company, JAB, which bought the chain from the British private equity company Bridgepointfor £1.5bn in 2018, revealed that Pret made a £525.5m pre-tax loss last year.The company, which made a £61.7m loss in 2023, was hit by a £552.9m non-cash writedown, which is understood to relate to how JAB assessed the value of the brand, its properties and other assets linked to Pret.The writedown equates to slashing the value of the chain by about a third compared with its acquisition price.In a filing, the company said that it had never previously recorded an impairment charge for the business but considered last year to be the first since the onset of Covid with “consistent trading data to base future forecasts”.The company said the impairment in value had taken into account the current uncertain global macroeconomic environment, as well as additional costs arising from last autumn’s budget, which included arise in employer national insurance contributions and an increase in the minimum wage.After adjusting for the non-cash impairments, Pret made a £98m operational profit, a 36% year-on-year increase.Like-for-like sales grew 2.8% and total revenues including new openings grew by 10% to £1.2bn.“2024 was another year of growth for Pret, where we took disciplined decisions to protect sales, despite intense strains on the hospitality industry,” Christou said.The company revealed that the total number of directly employed staff fell by almost 1,400 last year, a 14% drop from 9,541 to 8,165, because of the sale of stores. Overall, including in franchise stores, the company has 12,000 staff worldwide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Both have previous experience as guest judges on the show.The BBC has confirmed that Haugh already stood in for Wallace in the final episodes of the current amateur edition ofMasterChef, which was filmed at the end of last year. It was only at that point that Wallace stepped back from the programme, when a series of allegations were made about his behaviour.Inside MasterChef’s nightmare fortnight: where does the show go now?Read moreThe BBC has already announced that the TV host and chefMatt Tebbutt will replace Wallaceas a judge on the next series of MasterChef: The Professionals.Dent, who has been a regular guest critic on MasterChef for more than a decade, said: “I’m over the moon to be coming back to the MasterChef kitchen and unearthing what culinary skills people have been cooking up behind closed doors.“It’s a joy to be working with Anna, who brings all her incredible experience to the table. I am in for such a treat with this series, I can’t wait to get started.”Haugh said she had admired Dent’s “writing and wit” for years.“MasterChef has long inspired and resonated with cooks in home kitchens and of course in my industry,” she said. “I can’t wait to get into the studio for what will be a great competition.”It comes after Wallace was dropped after an independent reportsubstantiated 45 allegationsmade against him, including claims of inappropriate sexual language and one incident of unwelcome physical contact. He has apologised “for any distress caused” but said the report cleared him of “the most serious and sensational accusations”.Torode was also dropped as a presenter after being the subject of a substantiated complaint overthe use of racist language.A BBC spokesperson said in July: “John Torode denies the allegation. He has stated he has no recollection of the alleged incident and does not believe that it happened. He also says that any racial language is wholly unacceptable in any environment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was raised in Auchterarder, Perthshire. He moved to Holyhead in 1980 where he had a long career as a customs officer.“A lifelong transport enthusiast, in retirement he enjoyed visiting heritage railways and tramways around the world. It is a comfort to his sons, their mother, and his brothers that his final moments were in pursuit of the hobby which gave him so much happiness.”Theother British victims have been named asthe theatre director Kayleigh Smith, 36, and her partner Will Nelson, 44, a lecturer at Manchester’s Arden School of Theatre.Also among the dead were five Portuguese nationals, two Canadians, two South Koreans, one American, one French, one Swiss and one Ukrainian.Portugal’s Office for Air and Rail Accident Investigations on Saturday released itsfirst investigative reportinto the crash, which said the cabins had travelled “not more than about six metres” when they “suddenly lost the balancing force provided by the cable connecting them”.The report said an examination of the wreckage showed “the connecting cable had given way” at the attachment point to the cabin at the top of the hill.A preliminary and final report are expected to be published later.Lisbon’s city council has tasked a team of experts with designing a new mechanism to ensure the safety of the Glória funicular railway, a city official said on Monday.“We must guarantee maximum security,” the council’s vice-president, Filipe Anacoreta Correia, said, adding that the country needed to be reassured over safety before the cable car could reopen.The group will include technicians from the municipal public transport company Carris, which operates the funicular, and experts from universities, Portugal’s engineering regulatory organisation, and national civil engineering laboratory LNEC, Correia added.During an extraordinary meeting, the council also voted to give the expert team the final say on when it was safe to resume the funicular’s operation.Additional reporting by ReutersExplore more on these topicsPortugalWalesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The EU has a goal to ban it in all its marine protected areas by 2030, Sweden has banned it, as has Greece. The lack of a ban in so-called “protected areas” has led to environmental groups referring to MPAs in the UKas “paper parks”.The Commons committee has written to the new environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, asking her to reconsider a complete ban on bottom trawling within offshore MPAs and to clarify whether she will seek to ensure the government’s approach does not undermine the integrity of protected waters.The issue became more prominent after being highlighted ina film by Sir David Attenborough releasedearlier this year to coincide with his 99th birthday.It showed the barren destruction left in the wake of the trawlers, with areas that once thronged with fish, seahorses and other marine life decimated.“The idea of bulldozing a rainforest causes outrage, yet we do the same underwater every day,” says Attenborough in the film. “Surely you would argue it must be illegal.”The chair of the committee, Toby Perkins MP, said: “Bottom trawling is a destructive practice. We hugely welcome the government moving forward with banning it in more protected areas of our oceans.“However, the committee is disappointed that the government has not committed to wider bans within marine protected areas which risk undermining the integrity of marine protected areas.”A Defra spokesperson said: “Restoring our oceans to good health is essential for both nature and for fishing businesses.“This government is taking decisive steps to ban bottom trawling when it is damaging protected seabeds, and our consultation makes clear how this would be implemented appropriately.”Explore more on these topicsFishingFishing industryEnglandConservationGreen politicsMarine lifenewsShareReuse this content"

Late last month park workers got a fascinating glimpse at the animal’s journey to the island.Angel Island staffers traveling by boat saw a coyote swimming along Raccoon Strait, and filmed it paddling across the deep waterway between the island and mainland Marin county. The coyote was about a quarter mile from shore and safely returned to the island, the park posted online.A breeding pair of the animal first arrived to the island in 2017 and over the years have “gradually [filled] a new mammalian predator niche”, according to the state park. But their presence was so unexpected that initial sightings of the animal were dismissed. Park staffers believe the animals doggy paddled a mile across a strong current from Tiburon to Angel Island.Researchers with the California department of fish and wildlife (CDFW) have beenstudying the phenomenonand found in 2024 there were between 14 to 17 coyotes, about a third of which were female. The animals were all related and have one, now deceased, mother or grandmother, according to the state park.The growing population on the island comes as coyotes are expanding their presence across the Bay area.“We do know coyotes have been expanding south into Marin county and to San Francisco. They’re already taking exploratory things like going across the Golden Gate Bridge,” Brett Furnas, an ecologist with CDFW, toldBay Naturelast year. “So it’s not a stretch that they would, maybe by accident, get swept across to Angel Island, or intentionally do that.”Ferry workers and park staff have seen coyotes swimming in the channel before, but the sightings are rare, a park interpreter toldSFGate, which first reported on the development.The park shared video of last month’s sighting online, sparking curiosity and concern from people unfamiliar with the animal’s swimming habits.“Coyotes are strong swimmers,” the park wrote. “Park staff work daily to protect coyote, mainly by teaching the public what to do and what not to do if they encounter a coyote.”Explore more on these topicsSan FranciscoCaliforniaWildlifeAnimalsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Recent research has reported a significant presence of disposable face masks in both terrestrial and aquatic environments.Face masks and gloves found on 30% of UK beaches in clean-upRead moreBogush and her co-author, Ivan Kourtchev, set out to determine how many microplastic particles were released from face masks simply sitting in water, without moving at all.They left newly bought masks of several different kinds for 24 hours in flasks containing 150ml of purified water, then filtered the liquid through a membrane to see what came out.Every mask examined by Bogush and Kourtchev leached microplastics, but it was the FFP2 and FFP3 masks – marketed as the gold-standard protection against the transmission of the virus – that leached the most, releasing four to six times as many.“The particle sizes of MPs [microplastics] varied greatly, ranging from around 10μm–2,082μm, but microplastic particles below 100μm were predominant in the water leachates,” they wrote in their paper,published in the journal Environmental Pollution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Subsequent chemical analysis of the leachate found medical masks also released bisphenol B, an endocrine-disrupting chemical that acts like oestrogen when absorbed into the bodies of humans and animals.Taking into account the total amount of single-use face masks produced during the height of the pandemic, the researchers estimated they led to the release of 128-214kg of bisphenol B into the environment.Bogush said: “We can’t ignore the environmental cost of single-use masks, especially when we know that the microplastics and chemicals they release can negatively affect both people and ecosystems. As we move forward, it’s vital that we raise awareness of these risks, support the development of more sustainable alternatives and make informed choices to protect our health and the environment.”Explore more on these topicsPlasticsWastePollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

Experts said the lack of any numbers, even of a provisional nature, or a range, was a poor sign at such a late stage of the process.Niklas Höhne, a co-founder of the research organisation New Climate Institute, said: “It is disappointing to see that the internal discussions on the EU’s new climate target do not yet include target values. It is getting very late. It is now extremely urgent that the EU presents a new climate target to the international negotiations. So far, only 28 out of 196 countries have submitted a new target. Only the EU’s submission could unleash momentum and move other countries to follow suit.”Member states and the commission have been working on an agreement for months to fulfil the bloc’s obligations under the2015 Paris climate agreementto come up with commitments on carbon reductions for the next decade.‘Every company wants to produce the last barrel sold’: the treaty to stop fossil fuel productionRead moreAll countries must produce national plans on emissions, called nationally determined contributions (NDCs), under the Paris agreement, but so far only about 30 have done so. The UN has called on all countries to submit their NDCs before a key meeting on the sidelines of the UN general assembly on 24 September, to give time for them to be assessed before theCop30 climate summit in Brazil this November.The EU’s current target is for reductions of 55% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, which the bloc should be able to meet if policies are strengthened.The next NDC, for 2035,should set the EU on track to meet its goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, which would imply a reduction of 90% to 95% in emissions by 2040, and therefore a reduction of about 74% to 78% in emissions by 2035,depending on how it is calculated.Michael Petroni, a climate policy analyst for Climate Analytics, said that to reach net zero emissions, more action was needed in the shorter term, rather than delaying action until closer to mid-century. He said: “The leaked document fails to state a 2035 target, but a graph implies a simple linear path from 2030 to 2040. Our analysis clearly shows that none of the resulting 2035 levels would be aligned with 1.5C. A straight-line approach delays critical near-term action, at a time when global leadership is most needed.”The EU’s discussions are made more complicated by timelines. The EU’s internal plans call for a 2040 target, which was supposed to be set first, so that an NDC with a 2035 goal could be extrapolated from that. But some member states have raised the prospect of separating the discussions, so that an NDC could be set first and a 2040 target later.Any separation would almost certainly imply a weaker NDC and 2040 target than experts are calling for, however, and any delay to the NDC would be seized on by those who wishCop30to fail.Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, has raised the prospect of a delay or dilution of the bloc’s commitments. Campaigners fear Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, may weaken despite his need for backing from the Greens, and Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister of Italy, has railed against EU green policies in the past. Viktor Orbán, the hard-right leader of Hungary, is also expected to push to weaken the target.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The delays contradict the urgency of climate action and the pursuit of security and prosperity – clean energy delivered nearly a third of Europe’s economic growth last year, and an ambitious target promises more jobs, energy security, more investment, and higher competitiveness on the global stage.”Any perception of a lack of commitment from the EU would cause problems at Cop30, a summit already troubled by US hostility and geopolitical headwinds. Donald Trump has, for a second time, announced the withdrawal of the US from the Paris agreement, and isdismantling climate policies and environmental institutions in the US.Although no other countries have yet followed him out of the Paris agreement, countries that want to slow or obstruct progress at Cop30 – including petrostates such as Russia andSaudi Arabia– have been heartened by Trump’s stance. Other countries may see Cop30 and climate targets as less of a diplomatic priority amid geopolitical turmoil – China and India, which have yet to produce their NDCs, have formed warmer relationships with Russia.Sieber warned that the EU must play a stronger role: “At a time when we should be collectively stewarding the Paris agreement, it is a bitter and dangerous irony that French president Macron is attempting to water down ambition. These games undermine Europe’s credibility at Cop30, stain the legacy of the Paris agreement, and shamefully betray the climate commitments the world is counting on.”TheEuropean Commissiondeclined to comment on the leaked document.Explore more on these topicsGreenhouse gas emissionsCop30European UnionClimate crisisEuropean CommissionGreen politicsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

This is a cosmetic rebranding, tweaking and expansion of the same unreliable and punishing system as the one before. It still includes many of the risks that teachers and headteachers fear, without significant benefits or safeguards,” Waters said.A letter signed by Waters, trade unions, former school inspectors and mental health experts has been sent to Phillipson stating thatOfstedhas failed to learn the lessons of Perry’s death and calling on the secretary of state to intervene.Perry killed herself in 2023 after Caversham primary school, which she had led for more than a decade, was downgraded from Ofsted’s current highest grade of outstanding to its lowest, inadequate, over safeguarding concerns.Berkshire’s senior coroner ruled her suicide was “contributed to by an Ofsted inspection”, after an inquest heard testimony from colleagues and medical professionals of the mental distress Perry suffered during and after the inspection.Ofsted said it had listened carefully to feedback from parents and professionals and had made a number of alterations to its original proposals after they were put out for public consultation earlier this year, attracting 6,500 responses, of which many were hostile.Under the new regime, inspectors will look at a wider range of aspects of a school including curriculum and teaching, attendance and behaviour, leadership and governance, achievement and inclusion.Each evaluation area will receive a grade, ranging from “exceptional” to “strong standard”, “expected standard”, “needs attention” and “urgent improvement”, offering parents a more granular and nuanced portrait of how a school is performing, Ofsted said.The report card will also include a section on safeguarding, assessing whether standards have been met or not. The single overall judgment for a school, which has been seen as particularly problematic, wasscrapped in September 2024.Phillipson said:“New school report cards will raise the bar for standards across the board, shining a light on what’s working and where change is needed. By providing a fuller picture of school performance – from attendance and behaviour to inclusion – we’re giving parents the transparency they deserve and schools the tools to improve.”Ofsted said a YouGov poll found almost seven in 10 parents surveyed preferred the new-look report cards to Ofsted’s current inspection reports, but unions and school leaders expressed grave reservations about the “rushed” timetable, with new inspections starting on 10 November.Pepe Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Let’s remember that this entire process began with the suicide of a headteacher under the previous inspection system. Yet here we are with a reformed system which appears to be even worse.”Announcing the new regime on Monday, the chief inspector of schools in England, Martyn Oliver, said: “Children deserve the best possible education; their parents deserve the best possible information and education professionals deserve to have their work fairly assessed by experts. The changes we are presenting today aim to achieve all three of these things.”Where areas for improvement are identified, schools and colleges will receive additional monitoring inspections to ensure rapid progress, while nurseries and childminders will be inspected every four years instead of six.Oliver said there would be a new focus on inclusion, and on disadvantaged and vulnerable children, as well as a more collaborative approach to inspection, paying greater attention to school leaders’ wellbeing and workload. Each inspection team will have an additional inspector to add capacity.Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “We completely reject that a Nando’s-style 1-5 grading scale is good for children or parents. Report cards won’t help keep children safe, boost good teaching or motivate learning.”Jon Coles, the chief executive of United Learning, England’s largest academy trust, was more positive. “It is important to our school system, to parental confidence and ultimately to the success of children that there is high-quality, trusted, independent and rigorous reporting to parents about the quality of their local schools. I am pleased that the new inspection framework looks set to provide this,” he said.The shadow education secretary, Laura Trott, said: “Labour are destroying school standards just to play to the tune of the unions. They’re replacing the rigorous inspections that were key to improving our schools with a hollow, watered-down system.”Explore more on these topicsOfstedSchoolsTeachingEducation policyEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But amid a wave of interest in the cosmetic procedure and clinics in Turkey offering discounts, the NHS inEnglandhas issued a stark warning, urging people against it.The surgery involves breaking the bones in the legs before pulling them apart to lengthen them over weeks or months.Invented by the Soviet surgeon Gavriil Abramovich Ilizarov in the 1950s, it was used to treat patients with clinical needs, but is now offered privately for cosmetic purposes.China’s health ministrybanned cosmetic leg lengtheningin 2006, over fears about the risks to patients, but the practice is booming elsewhere. The global limb-lengthening industry will be worth $8.6bn (£6.4bn) by 2030,according to estimates.Private treatment in the UK can cost more than £50,000, with some surgeons charging £240,000. Clinics in Turkey offer the procedure for £24,000.Limb-lengthening surgery involves two main steps. A surgeon performs an osteotomy, cutting the bone into two segments, and then attaches a limb lengthening device to the two segments. The device comprises a thin metal frame and is attached to the bones with pins or wires. Most of the device is outside the body, making it hard to wear certain clothes. Newer options involve a screw-like device placed inside the bone.Patients face a period of recovery and cannot walk for several weeks. Next, they begin adjusting their leg-lengthening device several times a day for several months. Each adjustment separates the bone segments a small amount. As the bones separate, the body creates new bone to fill the gap between them.However, if not done carefully, the risks are high. Bones separated too quickly will not mend or will grow together with tissue too fragile to bear the body’s weight.Some legs can end up being different lengths. Patients also risk infection, nerve damage and permanent disability.Prof Tim Briggs, an orthopaedic surgeon andNHSEngland’s national director for clinical improvement and elective recovery, said leg lengthening surgery was “not a quick fix”.“It is a serious, invasive procedure that can be beneficial for patients when there is a genuine clinical need but carries significant risks and requires informed discussions between patient and surgeon.“Patients face months of treatment, which can be extremely painful, with the possibility of infection, nerve damage, blood clots and even permanent disability.“Anyone considering this surgery for cosmetic reasons abroad, should think very carefully about the long recovery and the risks, and I would urge against it unless well informed about where they are seeking treatment.“Don’t gamble with your health or your life for a few extra inches without fully understanding the risks.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

They say the social media company, which owns Facebook, Instagram, and offers a line of VR headsets and games, deleted or doctored internal safety research that showed children being exposed to grooming, sexual harassment and violence in its 3D realms.“Meta knew that underage children were using its products, but figured, ‘Hey, kids drive engagement,’ and it was making them cash,” Jason Sattizahn, one of the whistleblowers who worked on the company’s VR research, said in a statement. “Meta has compromised their internal teams to manipulate research and straight-up erase data that they don’t like.”Sattizahn and the other whistleblowers, all current or former Meta employees, have disclosed these findings and a trove of documents to Congress, according tothe Washington Post, which first reported the allegations. Sattizahn and Cayce Savage, who was Meta’s lead researcher on youth user experience for VR, will appear before the US Senate judiciary subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law on Tuesday.Zuckerberg tells parents of social media victims at Senate hearing: ‘I’m sorry for everything you’ve been through’Read moreDani Lever, a Meta spokesperson, said the company has approved 180 studies related to its VR Reality Labs since 2022, which include research on youth safety and wellbeing.“These few examples are being stitched together to fit a predetermined and false narrative,” she said, adding that Meta has introduced features to its VR products to limit unwanted contact and supervision tools for parents.Meta has not done enough to safeguard children, whistleblower saysRead moreThe whistleblower allegations made public on Monday claim that on Meta’s VR products, the company could have done more to ensure children’s safety. The whistleblowers say company managers instructed staff to avoid research that might show evidence of child harm in virtual reality.In one instance, a researcher was reportedly told to “swallow that ick”.In another instance, a researcher was allegedly told to delete information from an interview they had conducted with a German family, according to the Washington Post. During that interview, a teenage boy told the researcher that his brother, who was under the age of 10, had “frequently encountered strangers” in Meta’s VR and that “adults had sexually propositioned his little brother”.The allegations arise as a steady procession of former Meta employees havecome forward to criticize the companyfor not doing enough to protect children from harm on its social media products. Lawmakers have also repeatedly grilled Meta executives for pushing content to youth that promotes bullying, drug abuse and self-harm.At one congressional hearing in January 2024, Republican senator Josh Hawley prodded Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, intopublicly apologizing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Important move! We don’t need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!! Hopefully the Academy Awards, and other Fake Award Shows, will review their Standards and Practices in the name of Fairness and Justice. Watch their DEAD RATINGS SURGE!”Hanks had been scheduled to receive the 2025 Sylvanus Thayer Award later this month for his “service and accomplishments in the national interest”.In a message to faculty, retired Col Mark Bieger declared the cancellation would allow the institution to “continue its focus on its core mission of preparing cadets to lead, fight and win as officers in the world’s most lethal force, the United States Army”, without elaborating how the two are connected.Hanks has previously endorsed Democratic candidates including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.He has been deeply involved in veterans’ causes. He was the national spokesperson for the World War II Memorial in Washington DC.

The course is not only confirmed: we will accelerate and deepen it even further.”In Sunday’s elections, only seats in Buenos Aires province were at stake – not including the capital of the same name. It had held its elections in May, which were won by the president’s party.Milei has slashed public spending, dismissed tens of thousands of public employees and led a major deregulation drive since taking office in December 2023. But in recent months, things have begun to go wrong for him.“The economy has not advanced sufficiently, inflation has not been brought down in any significant way, and wages have been practically frozen,” said Tokatlian, a professor of international relations at the Universidad Torcuato Di Tella in Buenos Aires.The government faced a cryptocurrency debacle after the president promoted an obscure token called $Libra, which soared in value following his endorsement before collapsing dramatically, prompting dozens of criminal complaints alleging fraud.Milei also vetoed bills that would have increased pensions and disability benefits, but last week, the national congress took a step not seen in more than 20 years and overturned the president’s veto.Signs of Milei’s growing unpopularity were already evident when, nearly two weeks ago, he waspelted with stonesby demonstrators while campaigning for Sunday’s election.Alejandro Daniel Pons, 57, an architect from Mar del Plata, voted for Milei in the 2023 presidential election but chose not to vote on Sunday because he did not want to back either the president’s party or the opposition.“[Milei] should keep governing because he does know about economics, but he went too far in squeezing ordinary people. That mistake has now come back to haunt him at the polls,” Pons said.Turnout was nearly 65% – about 10% lower than in the previous local polls. According to Tokatlian, those who stayed away were precisely the voters who, in 2023, had backed Milei over Peronism – the name given to Argentina’s main leftwing movement, in reference to former president Gen Juan Domingo Perón and his wife, Eva.“This time the anger is with the government,” he said.University student Valentina Villagra, 27, who lives in the district of Hurlingham, said that finding work has become extremely difficult, and the jobs that do exist offer very low wages.“Faced with a government that is determined to purchase power and wipe out all the human and social rights we have built … the only possible response was Peronism,” she said.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaJavier MileiAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Ding dong ditch, knock-a-door run, or knock-down-ginger as it is variously referred to in English, it typically involves children or youths ringing on a doorbell then running away before they are caught.But when the ringing continued even after the arrival of two police officers, despite the fact that no one was at the door and a motion detector had failed to activate, a closer look at the metal bell plate revealed the presence of the slug, ornacktschneckein German – literally a “naked snail”.“We’d gone to bed … but we don’t tend to answer the door after 10pm, so when the bell rang, I tried to ignore it. I thought it might be the kids from the abandoned house over the road,” Lisa, 30, a shop sales assistant told the tabloid Bild.“But then my sister in law who lives upstairs called, and asked whether our bell was ringing, as hers wouldn’t stop. It kept ringing even as we telephoned and despite the fact no one could be seen at the door. We became really uneasy. That’s when we decided to call the police.”Together residents and police discovered the slug traversing the door entry panel. “You could even see the slime trail it had made as it crawled over the sensors,” Lisa said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In an era of 7in singles packed with 30-second screeds, Flipper would draw their tunes out to 20-or-more minutes of grind, fielding spiteful comparisons to hated hippies the Grateful Dead as bassist and founder Will Shatter warned audiences, “the more you heckle us, the longer this song gets”.But the true “culprit for any pissing off of audiences”, as drummer Steve DePace toldScene Point Blankin 2022, was Loose. Born Bruce Calderwood, in the late 70s Loose cashed in a life insurance policy his mother bought for him and spent the money on a bass guitar and amplifier. He soon joined an embryonic version of Flipper in 1979, assuming the nom-du-punk “Bruce Lose” (which he later switched for “Bruce Loose”, because he wanted to be “less negative”) and sharing bass and vocal duties with Shatter. The pair laid down heavy, industrial bass lines, while guitarist Tim Falconi, a Vietnam vet Loose later alleged had PTSD, fired off abrasive, trebly guitar lines.There was, no question, a darkness to Flipper; Loose told theSan Francisco Bay Guardianin 2005: “We saw a society that was going to hell, and we were either going to drag it all the way to hell, or drag it up out of hell.” But there was also a complexity to their lyrics beyond the rote misanthropy of their contemporaries. Ever, the black-hearted opening track to their 1982 debut Album – Generic Flipper, concluded with Loose ranting “Ever wish the human race didn’t exist? / And then realise you’re one, too?” while Life found Shatter reflecting, “I too have sung death’s praise / But I’m not going to sing that song any more … Life is the only thing worth living for.”View image in fullscreenA grimy, joyful car crash: Ted Falconi, Bruce Loose, Steve DePace and Rachel Thoele of Flipper perform in Nottingham in 2012.Photograph: Ollie Millington/Redferns/Getty ImagesIn concert, Flipper often fieldeda pulverising version of nursery rhyme The Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly, while their signature anthem, Sex Bomb –later covered by REM– was a grimy, joyful car crash of 50s rock’n’roll and punk, welding shredding saxophones and screaming theremin to eight minutes of rutting noise-rock and a repeated deranged refrain of “She’s a sex bomb my baby yeah!” On tour, the band would welcome local sax-players on stage to jam along with it; anarchy regularly ensued.A commendable second album, Gone Fishin’, followed in 1984, but the group split after Shatter died of a heroin overdose in 1987, only to re-form in 1990 after Rick Rubin signed them to his Def American label. The self-produced American Grafishy surfaced in 1993 by which time Flipper were being championed as an influence by groups such as Melvins, Jane’s Addiction andNirvana, whose Kurt Cobain wore a homemade Flipper T-shirt on Saturday Night Live and in the video for Come as You Are. But Flipper never quite got to cash-in on the grunge moment: Loose was seriously injured in 1994 after rolling his truck off a country road and breaking his back.Flipper: Ha Ha Ha – videoThere would be occasional reunions in the years that followed, most notably in the noughties, when Nirvana’s Krist Novoselic joined for their appearance at 2006’s Thurston Moore-curated All Tomorrows Parties: Nightmare B4 Christmas. It led to an unexpected fourth Flipper studio album, 2009’s Love. “Krist started rehearsing with us and just popped out an ad-libbed bass line, and we all went along with it, and we clicked,”Loose said. “We all realised we didn’t have to just be sitting back and doing the same old stuff, becoming a punk-rock revue type of band.”Go hard or go home: why is hardcore punk enjoying a renaissance?Read moreLoose would exit Flipper soon after, however. “I told [the other members] after the 2009 tour, I’m done,” he toldSuburban Rebels, citing his many health issues, including his ongoing lower-back pain. Loose later said he had been “voted out” of the group by the other members, who hired Jesus Lizard frontman David Yow to take his place for shows between 2015 and 2022, while punk-rock lifer Mike Watt sang and played bass on their most recent tours.Loose, meanwhile, continued to battle his serious health issues, which he ascribed to “35 years of punk life. We ain’t got no health coverage, no retirement plan.” It was a lifestyle that had given his 66 years considerable meaning, however. As he confessed to the San Francisco Bay Guardian two decades ago, “For me, it was pertinent to be on the edge. Otherwise, I didn’t feelaliveenough. It was a challenge to see how long you could live on the edge without dying.”Explore more on these topicsPunkNirvanacommentShareReuse this content"

So when someone walked by the studio with a husky, I said, “Do you want to howl with your dog?”’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 8 Sep 2025 10.05 EDTLast modified on Mon 8 Sep 2025 20.08 EDTShareDevendra Banhart, singer, songwriter, guitaristI wrote I Feel Just Like a Child when I was 18, but it wasn’t until I was 23 or 24 and making theCripple Crowalbum that it made sense to record it properly. As a teenager I’d thought of myself as an old blues guy anddemoed it on an unplugged electric guitar as a slow blues. When we recorded it for Cripple Crow I’d found my musical family, people like [producer-musicians] Andy Cabic from Vetiver, Noah Georgeson and Thom Monahan. Along with the likes of Joanna Newsom and Adam Green from Moldy Peaches, we were doing a sort of anti-folk that was labelled “freak-folk”.We were living in Woodstock in upstate New York in our own mini 60s world, a utopian bubble where it felt like music from any period was up for grabs. We spent a lot of time in record stores and the music library, grabbing soundscapes, electronic music, the Fugs, the Band or Basement Jaxx, trying to gain influence from everything we could.I used the loo at a gas station and forgot to lock the door. Somebody walked in – I owe that person a lot of therapyWe recorded in nearby Bearsville, a legendary studio that had been set up by Bob Dylan’s manager Albert Grossman when Dylan lived there. We had a hippy ethos about pacifism, sisterhood and egalitarianism, but also I was very aware that this wasn’t the 1960s – it was the leather jacket, Strokes period of music – so there was a parody element to it all. However, I Feel Just Like a Child was genuine. It was about how I could get away with being myself – naive and idealistic – without shame.When I returned to it for Cripple Crow, I wrote more lyrics. “From my womb to my tomb” is my little homage to Marc Bolan – a direct reference to T Rex’s Cosmic Dancer. Otherwise I wrote from the perspective of a kid, seeing the world with fresh eyes. It’s partly a bricolage of childhood memories: “I need you to help me blow my nose and I need you to help me count my toes.” The line “I need you to please explain the war” comes from the idea that the adults ruin everything. “I was born thinking all under the sky didn’t belong to a couple old white guys” is about how most of the world is owned by so few people.I was listening at the time to a lot of Fela Kuti, so the Cripple Crow version became more of a groove. In the studio we were like kids in a candy store with all this equipment, and wanted to do something more interesting than a key change, so in the middle of the song it sounds like everything goes underwater. And when someone walked past with a husky I said: “Do you want to howl with your dog?” – so there’s a dog credited on the album.One night some friends were filming, which ended up being the video and captures how we were then. Most of the time I was wearing only tiny shorts. I remember using the loo at a gas station and forgetting to lock the door. Somebody walked in and saw this scrawny, trembling, big-bearded, Charles Manson-looking guy sitting on the toilet. I owe that person a lot of therapy.Andy Cabic, producer, musicianWe were all broke, so we stayed at Devendra’s place. His family home in Poughkeepsie, New York, was always full of people. It was winter and really cold, so we were always at the house or in the studio working on things. He was writing so many songs that he would call his answering machine and leave melodies on there for himself. Everything was recorded live, and he’d gather us all in to do backing vocals.Devendra Banhart: ‘A tattoo of bull’s horns almost piercing my nipples felt very inspiring’Read moreDevendra’s original demo of I Feel Just Like a Child is a solo live performance of the kind he did a lot in those days. The version on Cripple Crow has a dancier arrangement and absorbs the possibilities of a proper studio and a roomful of musicians. I played acoustic guitar and the percussion is a combination of Devendra, Greg Rogove and myself. We were recording at a very fast clip and decisions were being made very quickly as we went along. It was a period of such furious activity. Devendra had at least 30 songs that he wanted to record, even if some of them were a minute-and-a-half things. They were pouring out of him.The 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition of Cripple Crow is out on 12 September on Heavy Flowers.An early demo versionof I Feel Just Like A Child is available now on streaming services and YouTubeExplore more on these topicsPop and rockHow we madeDevendra BanhartFolk musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He dismissed speculation at the time (withsome mild annoyance) and the job has sincelandedat the feet of Denis Villeneuve – but his latest, China-set gambling drama Ballad of a Small Player, adds flashy bombast to his résumé and helps to explain why even though he might have passed on Bond (and recently Ocean’s too), he’s in development on a Bourne.Berger is a canny commercial director, confidently switching between genre, language and location, the kind of able film-maker studios are desperate to entrust a franchise with, but I hope he’s sparing with the time he chooses to spend under the studio thumb. Ballad of a Small Player, an operatic adaptation of theLawrence Osborne novel, is not quite him at his best – it is far more bark than bite – but it’s made with such force and finesse and is so distinctively separate from his other films that I look forward to seeing what other non-sequel journeys he chooses to take us on in the future.Hedda review – Ibsen gets a Saltburn makeover in Amazon’s ill-advised rompRead moreHe’s headed straight from Rome to Macau, the Vegas of China, complete with fake skies, shoddier versions of global landmarks and a deck of gamblers whose shamelessly indulgent nights turn into existentially regretful days. One of them is Lord Doyle (Colin Farrell), a pretentious longtime guest of a hotel he’s struggling to afford. His performed posh accent and fake Savile Row gloves mask a working-class Irish pretender, whose luck at the Baccarat table has started to fade. His unpaid bills are mounting up and then there’s the small problem of a new hotel guest who might just know who he really is.That guest is played byTilda Swinton, who had another small role in a stylish Netflix character study about a man with a specific skillset, David Fincher’sThe Killer. In that film she was such a knockout that in one excellent extended scene, she managed to steal the entire movie, but here she’s a strange distraction, looking more like a character from a Roald Dahl novel (and in her final scene, like someone from The Hunger Games universe). It’s too much of a dress-up bit and her performance, and absurd styling, is a reflection of Berger’s tendency to crank too much of his film up to an 11 with a thumpingly dramatic score from Volker Bertelmann and an uncomfortably dialled-up sound design. At times the latter is horribly necessary, during some particularly unpleasant food binges, but too often, it renders us numb.Hamnet review – stately Shakespeare drama with emotionally overwhelming finaleRead moreIt is to Farrell’s great credit that he avoids following Berger all the way to the top and over, a role that would have forced a lesser actor into deafening histrionics (one can only wince at the thought of Nicolas Cage here) but one that he embodies with more thought and careful modulation. His character is an addict who cannot stop consuming, terrified by the fear that he might never be full. Farrell’s jittery unease – as he goes for one more game, has one more drink, eats one more slice – is made difficult to watch, but it sears less because of the cranked-up nature of Berger’s direction and more because of the actor’s haunted drive. What if there’s nothing out there to fill me up? Outside of his vices, he also hopes that a casino hostess, played with empathy by Fala Chen, might help.Where the film takes that particular, rather cliched dynamic is hard to understand before it becomes hard to stomach, a last-act reveal that we’ve seen too many times before. We’ve seen less of Macau though, at least in western cinema (Bond made a brief stop in Skyfall), and Berger shows its neon-drowned excess as successfully seductive before it becomes repellent, like so much of the film. The grim spectre of suicide brings a large shadow over the film, spoken about frankly by those who have found themselves in places without many options, and in the film’s hardest moments, Berger is able to capture just how awfully the overwhelm of addiction can make it all seem entirely hopeless. He is too often distracted though by the overwhelm of technique, and Ballad of a Small Player ends up a little too slight, a sketchy look at a familiarly doomed character (a third Oscar film in a row seems unlikely). Farrell is the real winner here.Ballad of a Small Player is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released in cinemas on 15 October and onNetflixon 29 OctoberExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewColin FarrellTilda SwintonDrama filmsNetflixreviewsShareReuse this content"

That could describe who he tends to be in “real” life (whatever that means in this context) but it’s also what he’s playing in Rental Family.The feelgood dramedy – or at least that’s what it tries so hard to be – is about an actual service in Japan that supplies actors who perform as bit players in everyday people’s lives. They’re hired by clients to fake it in roles as a family member, a friend or even the cheering audience at a karaoke bar. The premise packs meta layers and gives Fraser the opportunity to inhabit multiple roles, while turning the lens back on the audience to consider what we’re looking for in the movie(s). Unfortunately, when it comes to Rental Family, it’s just not that deep.Bad Apples review – Saoirse Ronan’s dark, school-set satire doesn’t go far enoughRead moreThe new film from co-writer and director Hikari (who helmed three episodes of the sharp and sinister Netflix series Beef) is enamoured (or even consumed) by the very artificiality it’s about, and too timid to scratch past the surface in a way that might threaten the easy laughs and mawkishness it’s ultimately after. And that’s too bad considering the cast on hand, not just Fraser – whose sad eyes give way to a well of emotions and thoughtfulness – but also the excellent and underutilised Mari Yamamoto (Monarch: Legacy of Monsters). She plays the more seasoned actor-for-rent colleague, who is regularly humiliated in gigs pretending to be mistresses making ritualised apologies to betrayed wives on behalf of their spineless husbands. As underwritten as her scenes may be, Yamamoto left me wishing the movie was about her.Instead, it belongs to Fraser, an Oscar winner for Darren Aronofsky’s oppressive The Whale – which falls on the extreme opposite of the mood spectrum from Rental Family. His Phillip is a struggling American actor in Japan whose embarrassing claim to fame is a hilariously tacky toothpaste commercial where he plays a superhero conquering gingivitis. Why Phillip chooses to remain in Tokyo is largely left for Fraser to suggest in the way his character ambles through the city. He bounces from audition to audition, seemingly lost in his own emotions, between crowds that flow rapidly and with intention, which Hikari captures with lovely views of the city.Phillip stumbles into the rental family game after his agent instructs him just to show up at a location for a gig that turns out to be a mock funeral, where the corpse, who turns out to be the client, gleefully rises from the dead – a hilarious introduction to this curious world. Phillip, reluctant at first with all the emotional deception at work, agrees to sign on full-time, coaxed by the firm’s owner (Takehiro Hira) who’s in need of a “token white guy” and insists that the fake affections they’re selling are ultimately uplifting and cathartic.Hikari hurriedly, and cloyingly, makes the case for this trade’s sentimental value. Phillip becomes a best friend to a lonely man who just needs company to play video games, pretends to be a journalist showing his appreciation to an ageing actor slipping into dementia (Akira Emoto, wonderful) and plays a fake husband in an elaborate sham marriage to a young girl who is trying to free herself from a restrictive household. He celebrates the latter job well done by spending the night with a sex worker, a charming exchange where the film-makers can’t resist spelling out how transactional affections are not just common but time-honoured.The job gets especially icky, and pretty preposterous, when Phillip is hired to fill in for the absent father to a biracial child named Mia (Shannon Gorman, precocious). It’s a temporary and irresponsible ploy to help the child secure admission into a coveted private school. To make the ruse convincing, the mother insists her vulnerable daughter not be let in on the ruse, basically setting Mia up to be abandoned again.Hikari and company mostly skim over the tension in a movie seemingly built out of highlight reels and lacking connective tissue. They only briefly acknowledge the heavy complications their scenario entails because their film would much rather indulge in calculated and aggressively cute moments and trite monologues, all set against postcard-ready shots of Tokyo’s scenery and culture.The whole movie basically affirms Phillip’s initial reservations. It’s not just his clients that are being emotionally manipulated. It’s us too.Rental Family is screening at theToronto film festivaland will be released on 21 November in the US, 26 December in Australia and January in the UKExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewDrama filmsToronto film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was directed by Maude Apatow, daughter of Judd, and stars, among others, Apatow’s mother, Leslie Mann, Cooper Hoffman (son of Philip Seymour Hoffman), and Nico Parker (daughter of Thandiwe Newton and film-maker Ol Parker). On paper it all looks like a make-work project to keep the well-connected busy and creatively fulfilled. But the film itself – Apatow’s debut – is rich and lively enough to make none of the nepo stuff really matter.Bad Apples review – Saoirse Ronan’s dark, school-set satire doesn’t go far enoughRead moreWritten by Raffi Donatich, Poetic License concerns a family who have moved from Chicago to a sleepy university town where economist James (Cliff “Method Man” Smith), has secured a plum professorship. He’s busy getting started, which leaves his wife Liz (Mann) a bit lonely and unmoored in her new life. Making matters worse is the inevitable drifting away of her high school-senior daughter, Dora (Parker), whose effort to make friends at her new school means she has to spend a little less time with mom. Liz is prone to a little risk, and so when two college boys, Sam and Ari, who are in the poetry class she’s auditing begin soliciting a friendship, she throws caution to the wind and accepts.It’s a cute setup, faintly reminiscent of the social complications of a Nicole Holofcener film (particularly 2013’s note-perfectEnough Said). Donatich’s script is a little less brainy, but there are enough witty observations about human foibles and needs to bring to mind Holofcener, a master of the form. There are also traces of Apatow the elder ribboning through the film, an improvisatory vibe that keeps things loose and, at times, a little baggy. Creating such a natural, lived-in texture is a tricky feat for any film-maker, let alone a first timer, so credit is due to Apatow the younger, known as an actor in TV’s Euphoria, for so deftly finding the film’s warm, inviting cadence.That would probably have been a far more difficult task with the wrong actors. But Apatow has cast smartly. Of course, she already knew that her mother is quite capable of playing Liz’s jumble of earthy empathy and daffy neuroticism. But she also deftly corrals Hoffman’s flurry of idiosyncrasies. And she helps Andrew Barth Feldman, who plays the other boy barging into Liz’s life, expand on the endearingly twitchy energy he showed in such spades in 2023’s No Hard Feelings. The three have a sparking, complementary chemistry, bouncing off of each other’s energy in endlessly appealing and amusing fashion.There could be a far darker, more psychosexual take on a story like this, but Poetic License mostly wants to take it easy. The boys do, of course, each develop crushes on Liz, and some mild calamity ensues. But Apatow and Donatich choose to see the sweetness in that, rather than delving into the unseemly implications of that dawning love and lust. They do inch the film toward that third rail on occasion, though, moments of giddy bluntness that go a long way in preventing the niceness of the movie from becoming cloying.Unlike the unsettlingly slavish devotion that Hallie Meyers-Shyer showed to her director parent, Nancy, in her first film, Home Again, Apatow maintains at least some distance from her father’s signature style. The influence is clearly there, and the film does drag on perhaps just a shade too long, as much of Judd Apatow’s work does. But Poetic License is far from mere pastiche. It has a distinct, youthful sensibility and sources its comedy more from recognisably human behaviour than from profane, one-liner riffing.Still, it is quite the family affair, daughter directing mother in a story partly about a mother and a daughter struggling to grow together and on their own. One hopes the experience was more pleasant than anything else; not everyone could survive taking direction from their child, or giving it to their parent. Whatever the arrangements or understandings were on set, one doesn’t feel a sense of carefully managed compromise in the final product. Poetic License would probably play well to someone who has no idea who the Apatows are.After all, Mann is only one part of the triumvirate leading the film. Apatow allows plenty of room for Feldman and Cooper to make the movie their own, an opportunity they seize with winsome aplomb. It’s easy to see why Sam and Ari fall for caring, empathic, erratic Liz. But Cooper and Feldman have so much offbeat charm that one does wonder why Liz isn’t, way down deep, perhaps equally smitten. It would be the cutest kind of taboo.Poetic License is screening at theToronto film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewComedy filmsComedyToronto film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

There was a much-derided stage production starring Mary-Louise Parker. There was Liz Meriwether’s sci-fi reimagining, Heddatron. And now there is Nia DaCosta’s film Hedda, a rejiggering of the narrative that places a premium on subterfuge and sexual intrigue. It sometimes lands its intended jolt, but too often mistakes arch style for profundity.That was also true of DaCosta’sCandyman sequel, an endlessly attractive film that was an otherwise confused update of the 1992 classic. Hedda fares better; it’s the work of a more assured and restrained writer-director, one who is willing to, on occasion, let visual flash take a backseat to more mechanical matters of storytelling. But there is nonetheless a recklessness to DaCosta’s version, its brash iconoclasm throws both baby and bathwater out of the manor-house window.Rental Family review – Brendan Fraser is stranded in mawkish misfireRead moreThe action has been transposed from 19th-century Oslo to 1950s Great Britain, where former bohemian free-spirit Hedda (Tessa Thompson) has moved into a sprawling estate with her new husband, pinched and humorless academic George (Tom Bateman). They’ve decided to throw a party, ostensibly to celebrate the house and their return from a long honeymoon, but actually functioning as a way to secure George a crucial teaching position. DaCosta immediately foreshadows that the bash is going to end badly, sending Hedda stalking around the place with a wicked strut, pistol in hand. An old friend – really, an old lover – has just phoned to say she’ll stop by and Hedda seems both unnerved and invigorated by the news.What Hedda plans to do about the impending arrival of Eileen Lovborg (Nina Hoss) – who is an academic rival of George’s and a mostly out lesbian who refuses to acquiesce to social code in the way that Hedda is at least partially willing to – is, essentially, the mystery of DaCosta’s film. It’s a mousetrap sort of affair, a jury-rigged evening of cruel manipulation all serving Hedda’s grand design for self-preservation.Which is certainly one facet of Ibsen’s play; Hedda has always been a bit cunning and ruthless, always steadfastly determined to keep herself in the finer things. But DaCosta turns her into a remorseless sociopath. She goes for bite and nastiness in the way of, say, Saltburn, badly boiling away the complexity of one of modern theater’s great characters.DaCosta takes some pains to tease out an idea of why Hedda has become this way: she is closeted and cosseted, she is Black in a largely white ecosystem, she not unjustifiably fears what may become of her should she lose her tenuous purchase on status. That argument is muddled, though. Race is glancingly mentioned but then never engaged with in a meaningful way. The film has more to say about sexuality, but depictions of queer repression’s dark consequence have been rendered more thoughtfully elsewhere. DaCosta fails to make a properly convincing case for her Hedda’s awful misdeeds.Thompson tears into the role, plummy accent and all. Her line readings are alternately blithe and venomous, she casts sly and calculating looks across rooms, she coils around her prey with seductive menace. It’s fun to watch, but it’s also too grandly villainous. DaCosta sends Thompson tearing through the film without the guardrails of nuance or credible complication.Then Hoss storms across the film’s ballroom, dragging the tablecloth with her. Hoss’s performance is a marvel; so marvelous, in fact, that DaCosta can’t help but shift the whole focus of the film on to her. Here is the picture of patriarchy’s warping effect that the film wants to paint elsewhere, here is the worthy and compelling figure of feminist outrage and frustration. As the film follows Eileen (who is a man called Eilert in the original play) on her dismal downward spiral, it finally whips up an unignorable resonance. Hedda, meanwhile, is left to plot in the periphery, making her seem all the more psychotically vicious.Hamnet review – stately Shakespeare drama with emotionally overwhelming finaleRead moreThere is maybe indication in DaCosta’s script that said psychotic viciousness is, in fact, some sort of manic depression that has been plaguing poor Hedda. But making that diagnosis requires too much work on the audience’s part, and perhaps too much familiarity with the original text. Watched in a vacuum – which, ideally, adaptations should be able to withstand – DaCosta’s Hedda is an annihilating and ultimately empty portrait of one woman destroying another out of the most basic, boilerplate motivation.Still, there is the wonder of Hoss’s breakneck work, and the sensory pleasures of DaCosta’s design. She captures the film’s nightmare party in richly saturated color, drenched in the golden glow of practical lighting. DaCosta dexterously moves her camera between rooms, gliding through scenes with smooth, exciting momentum. It’s an impressive feat of technical film-making, which has now become a hallmark of DaCosta’s work. But she caves to baser impulses in reinterpreting an old and, some might say, crusty play. There is a better Hedda Gabler to be made in this modernist, eye-popping mode. It just shouldn’t be one that so readily cheapens a character who’s earned over a century of close and careful attention, for good reason.Hedda is screening at theToronto film festivaland will be released in cinemas on 22 October and on Amazon on 29 OctoberExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewToronto film festivalFestivalsTessa ThompsonHenrik IbsenDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Like its predecessor, released just two months ago, Swag II unites a buzzy team of producers and writers known for freshening up R’n’B and hands them a precisely curated Pinterest board: Dangerous-era Michael Jackson, D’Angelo’s lush arrangements, Jai Paul’s glitchy, retro-futurist sonics and the sun-bleached textures of current collaborators Mk.gee and Dijon. But with unadventurous songwriting, the result is (another) album that’s all vibe and voguish production, and very little substance.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Swag II.Photograph: APOpener Speed Demon reheats Bieber’s “is it clocking to you” meme for the second time across both albums, albeit with a bright, funky bravado and a memorably bonkers chorus about “checking these chickens”, AKA leaving his critics in the dust. But for a song bragging about ambition, it lacks adrenaline – like many of Swag II’s safe, repetitive tracks.Much of the album offers an interesting, textured backdrop for Bieber’s pleading croon, and then goes nowhere. Oh Man just repeats its title. Open Up Your Heart, a frosty, Phil Collins-indebted ballad, teases progression – a key change, maybe! – only for absolutely nothing to happen. Love Song has a gorgeous, screwed-up string-section and some tepid “wooo!”s, neither of which can disguise how the track never earns those thrills. Rather, words fail Bieber as he sings about wanting to write his wife a love song – “a good one”.Everything Hallelujah suffers a similar fate, transforming a profound realisation about his faith into lyrical mundanity (“brush my teeth, hallelujah”) and musical cliche, with squeaking acoustic guitar strings serving as an easy shorthand for authenticity. Likewise Story of God, the nearly eight-minute sermon which closes the record: Bieber retells Adam and Eve (co-written by a pastor from his preferred celebrity megachurch) with generic ambient swooshes to underscore its sincerity.Justin Bieber: Don’t Wanna – videoSwag II is most convincing when it leans hard into pop – and all the way out the other side. Don’t Wanna has a fidgety MJ wriggle to it, with much-needed playfulness brought by UK alt singer Bakar, and the Dijon co-written Bad Honey fizzes with squirmy synths as Bieber’s both pissed off and turned on: “If you’re bad, honey, why you look so good?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

More generously, it’s an under-edited try-on of a more alternative sound, aided by talented collaborators watering down their own special sauce. Dijon’s album Baby is one of the year’s boldest – maximalist, crammed with ideas,fun.

A whole 10 years of turmoil, and still the country can’t seem to agree exactly why it happened or what should happen next, with both leavers and remainers increasingly united in frustration about what the referendum has delivered. How did we end up here?In Between the Waves, New Statesman editor Tom McTague makes an ambitious attempt to answer that question by zooming out and puttingBrexitin its broader historical context. The result is a great big entertaining sweep of a book, tracing the roots of Britain’s ambiguous relationship with its neighbours back to the end of the second world war, and will be joyfully inhaled by any reader who loves the kind of podcasts that invariably feature two men talking to each other. It charts the path from a time when membership was seen as an antidote to British decline – the chance for “a nation that lost an empire to gain a continent”, as the Sun put it in 1975 – to a time when it was singled out as the cause of it.Somewhat more controversially, it reframes the referendum less as an angry backlash from the economically left-behind, and more as the intellectually coherent outcome of a relationship that was always fundamentally unstable.From the beginning, McTague makes clear, Britain’s choice was between joining a union whose purpose (of pooling sovereignty, initially to contain a German resurgence) we distrusted, or staying out of something potentially powerful enough to threaten our national interests in the long run. Whatever else has changed – and bear in mind that in the 1970s Labour was the Eurosceptic party, while Ted Heath’s Conservative government led the pro-European charge – the constant has been British reluctance to be either wholly in or wholly out. Successive governments, he argues, managed those tensions by conveniently ignoring the EU’s core mission of ever closer integration in hot pursuit of all its other benefits.European perspectives are largely absent from a narrative that is hooked around a series of big British charactersSeen through this prism, David Cameron’s decision to call his career-ending referendum becomes less a panicky response to the rise of Nigel Farage and more a willingness to face up to contradictions others had brushed under the carpet, and which an expanding Europe had more clearly exposed.History is famously told by the winners, and McTague’s lead witnesses lean towards the leave side. With its focus on tracing Brexit’s origin story, the book feels oddly thin on insight from the Blair-Brown governments, an eventful period for EU membership when the battle was essentially between pro-Europeans over exactly how deep to go. Instead we get an exhaustive account of the academic influences on Michael Gove’s and Dominic Cummings’s thinking, and of the formation of the Eurosceptic campaign group Business for Sterling.European perspectives are also largely absent from a narrative that is hooked around a series of big British characters, from Enoch Powell to Margaret Thatcher to Cummings and Farage. The rest of the continent is relegated to a kind of vague background presence in Britain’s internal dramas. We’ve all been in relationships like that, I suppose, but it would have been nice to hear a little more from across the Channel – perhaps about why other member states such as Ireland and Denmark, who struggled to gain public consent for further integration, nonetheless stuck with it, or whether the great rupture of 2016 was avoidable. (McTague considers the Faragist argument that had the Blair government-imposed transitional curbs on immigration from eastern European members, eurosceptic feeling might never have grown so strong, before concluding that it lacks nuance.)The book ends, however, by acknowledging that Britain’s relationship with Europe may not be as settled as it currently looks, a prudent hedging of bets now that the threat from Putin is once more drawing British interests closer to those of its neighbours. But it’s also a reminder of the book’s underlying theme: that the British idea of Europe has never really been fixed, and changes conveniently to suit us. Though this chapter of our joint histories may be concluded, the story goes on.Between the Waves: The Hidden History of a Very British Revolution 1945-2016 by Tom McTague is published by Picador (£25).

TodayI walked that shoreline, humming,Camino Santiago,the road to St. James’s tomb,where pilgrims traveled,scallop badges on their capes,and chanted prayersfor a miracle to curedisease. And so I,stirred by their purpose,hunted for scallop shellsshaped like pleated fans,with mouths that open and closeto steer them from predators.I scooped up a fanand blew off sand grains, thinking,for that one moment,of how Saint James’ bodyrose from the sea decked with scallops,and of this empty beachin another austere time.Let this unholy pilgrimimplore the scallop shell,silvery half-moon, save us.This week’s poem is from Grace Schulman’sAgain, the Dawn: New and Selected Poems, 2022, published by Turtle Point Press. Moving at a graceful walking pace, contentedly beachcombing, it seems at first the poem’s speaker is reminded by the scallop-shells she sees of St James the Great and the Camino de Santiago. Pilgrimages are still made to the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, which was believed to have been built on the site where the remains of St James the Great were buried.The poet-pilgrim analogy is sharpened in verses five and six: the pilgrims “chanted prayers / for a miracle to cure // disease. And so I, / stirred by their purpose / hunted for scallop shells …” Those two activities – the chanting of the medieval miracle-seeking pilgrims in a time of plague, perhaps, and the shell-hunting of the speaker – are connected by more than the euphony of “chanted” and “hunted”: the threat of disease and death is motivating the speaker, too. The emptiness of the beach, registered in a later verse, is a further clue to the inception of the poem during the Covid pandemic.The term “verse” is a misnomer: as readers may have already noticed, the form of the poem is that of the extendedrenga(Japanese, meaning “linked form”). Schulman says the form “shouldn’t be apparent, shouldn’t show … it’s really a silent structure behind the actual pattern of stresses and light syllables.” Unlike manyrengas, Schulman’s poem wasn’t composed in collaboration with other writers. Perhaps it’s not too fanciful to suggest the shape on the page eachrengaunit creates bears a slight resemblance to the scallop shell, the larger, rounded shape of the bivalve being represented by the two sets of three lines, and its “auricles” (sometimes known as wings) suggested by the paired lines of the concluding couplet.Scallops have “mouths that open and close” thanks to the adductor muscles that enable them to swim. Their mouths look, and are, vulnerable, a distraction from the carved beauty of the shell which encourages us to see them more asobjetsd’art, collectors’ items.Patterning is subtly important not only to the poem’s structure, but to the images and the ebb and flow, rise and fall of emotion it records. In the beginning, the shells occupy a “scallop-edged shore”, “scallop” now indicating the presence of the curvy formations known as“beach-cusps”.Scallops next appear on the badges the Camino Santiago pilgrims wear on their capes in honour of their saint. Later, there’s the mythical image “of how Saint James’s body // rose from the sea decked with scallops”. The body as well as the sea is “decked” in this reference to one of the many legends to do with St James. You might say that the wavy line, the scallop-shape, governs the thought processes between actual scallops-on-the-beach and the scallop as icon: there is also, in the poem, an alternation of hope and fear, community and emptiness.Reading it in the summer of 2025, I find its awareness of erosion and corruption carries over without any jolt to the present, and the haunting sense that a new and dangerous virus may be germinating in the heavy, sultry new climate. It feels as if a chorus of praying pilgrims might, at this later moment in history, join in with the poet as she turns to the now god-like spirit of nature in its shrine of shell: “Let this unholy pilgrim / implore the scallop shell, //silveryhalf-moon,saveus.”Finally, for a salutary injection of optimism, here are the two epigraphs Schulman chose for her book: “For every poet it is always morning in the world” (Derek Walcott) and “Not knowing when the Dawn will come, / I open every door” (Emily Dickinson).Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They talk mean directors, bathtub revelations and reinventing Ibsen’s The Lady from the SeaMon 8 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 8 Sep 2025 09.29 EDTShareEntering the almost silent rehearsal room, I fear I’ve blundered into a private moment. The Lady from the Sea cast are seated in a tight circle and at least two of them have tears in their eyes. The quiet murmur of conversation suggests something heavy has just gone down. So I’m relieved when I realise they’re reading a scene – and stunned to discover the scene was written only yesterday.Simon Stone’s modern take on Ibsen’s play is still under construction, and he has had his actors together for less than a fortnight. “Most people really take six weeks to connect to scenes,” the Australian writer-director says during the lunch break. “Often an entire rehearsal process can be the slow marking out of stuff, and it takes until your first run-through to feel anything at all. We are connecting faster, because we’ve been talking about it so much.”After workshopping the characters with his actors, Stone writes dialogue based at least partly on their conversations, sometimes only the night before they rehearse it. It’s an approach that has inspired some memorably intense performances. A blisteringYerma was a career-defining moment for Billie Piperin 2016. Two years ago, Janet McTeer sent tremors around the National Theatre’s Lyttelton stage in an updated version of the Phaedra myth.I always ask, ‘Is the director a shouter?’ Lifeʼs too short to work with people who are unkindIn today’s hot seat – or, to be accurate, leather sofa – Andrew Lincoln andAlicia Vikanderare playing a couple whose married life is derailed by the return of the wife’s long-lost lover. “The way Simon works is sort of the opposite of my training,” says Lincoln, who had a long hiatus from the stage while starring in nine seasons of The Walking Dead. “It’s like you start at the end. But there’s no bullshit, he blows all of that away, and it’s been one of the most remarkable and enlightening things I’ve done in years.”That’s lucky, because Lincoln wasn’t completely sold on Ibsen’s play. He laughs that he was “ambushed” into the role of Edward – it was only halfway through their initial meeting that he even realised he was being offered a gig. “There’s a thriller aspect to the original that I loved. But I honestly think it’s oppressive. When someone mentions Ibsen to me, I don’t think of gut-belly laughs. But Simon’s got a track record.”View image in fullscreenStage break … Lincoln in The Walking Dead.Photograph: Frank Ockenfels/Amc Studios/AllstarStone’s modern tragedies are shot through with humour and today’s rehearsal is a case in point: Gracie Oddie-James and Isobel Akuwudike, in particular, fizz with comic chemistry as Edward’s daughters. The writer throws himself back in his chair with a huge cackle and wheezes with laughter even at what sound like serious parts. He watches intently as the scenes unfold in front of him and only occasionally interrupts with advice – say it slower, be more casual, come in faster – teasing out the musicality of the lines like a conductor.At lunch, Vikander is none the worse for a morning spent being shouted at by her fictional spouse: if anything, it seems to have delighted her. This is the first time the 36-year-old Oscar-winner has been in a theatre production since she was a teenager. “On a film the clock is ticking, because you know that you have three scenes in two days. Here it is such a joy because I have these wonderful nerves every day, from still not really understanding what we’re going to do in front of people.”Her mother, Maria, was a theatre actor, and Vikander herself trained as a ballet dancer: she never even imagined a screen career. “There’s no one saying ‘cut!’, so I really can lose myself in it all. I’m doing the thing I dreamed of as a kid. It’s a real high.” The one thing she was most apprehensive about was whether her voice would reach across the Bridge theatre’s auditorium. Stone reassures her: “You could do a 2,000-seater if you wanted to, Alicia.”Vikander knew the play already – she had seen a production in her home country of Sweden, and loved its radical feminism. Her first encounter with Stone – over Zoom while she was shooting a forthcoming film in Korea with her husband, Michael Fassbender – was an intense and revelatory conversation that only ended when they realised it was 1.30am where the actor was (Stone says he left the chat feeling “wonderfully embarrassed”).His works often contain autobiographical elements, albeit heavily disguised; he calls it “photocopies of photocopies of photocopies”. Lady from the Sea is no different. He first read Ibsen’s original in 2009, two months after encountering a similar situation in his own life. “I had been one half of a relationship that went through that,” says Stone. “I started reading this five-act play in the bath and I just couldn’t stop. By the end, the water was completely cold.”View image in fullscreenOscar winner … Vikander in The Danish Girl.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Alamy“I love that you were in the bath,” Vikander comments. “Very appropriate.”Stone’s stage productions – Yerma,Medea, Phaedra – are testament to the fact that he is more interested in female heroes than male ones. “When I started out I thought I would do just one or two plays focused on women. But it’s become pretty much everything [I do].” It’s why he is so drawn to Ibsen: “When you think that his female characters were written 150 years back, it’s extraordinary. And this from a man in his 50s and 60s. You just go – what?”The dramatic tension in The Lady from the Sea arises from the fact that the female protagonist is emotionally split in two – something Vikander can relate to. She has two sons, aged four and one, with Fassbender, and still feels guilty when she has to leave them for long days on set. Her grandmother worked – which was considered unusual at the time – and her mother’s earnings were often spent on the childcare she needed when she performed: “I don’t even know how she was able to pay rent,” says Vikander.She looks back with huge gratitude for an upbringing that modelled how a woman could be a fully committed artist and a loving, present mother. “She would get up at 4am to bake bread, because her mum never cooked for her,” she remembers. “And I’ve realised that to be the best mum, I also need to make sure I have this other thing that makes me the person I am.”Lincoln, who is 51, has developed his own important work-life rules. One is to do his research on the directors he works with: “The question you always ask is, ‘Are they a shouter?’ Life is too short to work with people that are going to be oppressive or unkind.”He talked to his friend Piper, whose work in Yerma he had admired, before committing to working with Stone. “She said, ‘It’ll be probably one of the most intense and frightening experiences, but you have to do it.’ It changed the way she worked for ever, and it gave her legitimacy that she felt she didn’t have before.”Lincoln is thrilled with the role that Stone has written for him; he has also, he says, noticed that he has entered the time of life where he is asked to play cuckolds. “But even when you were young, you were the other man,” says Stone. “Look at Love Actually!” Lincoln nods: when he made a film about Apollo 11 he played Michael Collins, the only astronaut on that mission who didn’t get to land on the moon. “Maybe I’m just the guy that doesn’t get the golden ticket.”Director Simon Stone: ‘My heroes are women’Read moreStone observes that that was the reason audiences adored James Stewart – the characters he played somehow accepted being second best. “But in this play it’s like we cast Jimmy Stewart to go, ‘I don’t want to be Jimmy Stewart any more’,” says Stone. “That’s what I love about it.”With lunch over, the director must hustle away and leave his cast to a group-led rehearsal: delays on his latest Netflix film mean he will spend this afternoon in a Soho editing suite. The Woman in Cabin 10, released next month, is his third movie (his first, The Daughter, was based on Ibsen’s The Wild Duck, and his most recent,The Dig, starred Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes). In a complete coincidence, it’s set in the North Sea, and even climaxes in Norway. “I didn’t know we were making a sequel,” jokes Vikander.It all adds to the impression that a Stone production can be a seat-of-the-pants ride for those involved. Vikander, making what is to all intents her professional stage debut, admits to knowing no different. “I think I came in extremely open,” she says, “and I’m discovering more each day. I feel as bare and real as I would in a film.”The Lady from the Sea is at theBridge theatre, London, from 10 September to 8 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreHenrik IbsenAlicia VikanderAndrew LincolnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I feel this show … will be a benchmark for me. A moment in my life when I look back and go forward. A true celebration of living.”Emin, most famous for Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-1995 (The Tent) and My Bed, has opened her own art school and embarked on a new body of work since she was diagnosed with aggressive bladder cancer five years ago.Why I Never Became a Dancer, one of Emin’s works from 1995.Photograph: Tracey EminThe exhibition will chart Emin’s work from her “first life” through to her second, post-illness and surgery. The confessional visual artist has spoken candidly aboutsurviving cancer, the surgery she underwentand how she now has a stoma (an opening in her abdomen) and relies on a urostomy bag to collect her urine.“I am really happy that I didn’t die and I am around to see this exhibition,” Emin said earlier this year. “I was there at the opening of the Tate Modern in 2000 – and at the time it felt like the most exciting thing that could ever possibly happen to London. You judge a city by its art,” she added in celebration of the gallery’s 25th birthday.The survey exhibition will bring together more than 90 works including painting, video, textile, neon, sculpture and installation, demonstrating Emin’s “uncompromising confessional approach to sharing experiences of love, trauma and personal growth”.View image in fullscreenNeons are to be part of the exhibition.Photograph: Tracey EminThe Tate Modern said: “Emin’s commitment to unapologetic self-expression has transformed our understanding of what art can be and continues to influence contemporary art today, using the female body to explore passion, pain and healing.“Spanning her extraordinary 40-year practice – from seminal installations made in the 1990s, to recent paintings and bronzes going on display for the first time – A Second Life marks the most significant exhibition of Emin’s career, tracing the key life events that have shaped her journey and transformation.”The exhibition will begin by presenting works from Emin’s first solo exhibition at White Cube with a series of tiny photographs of her art school paintings from the 1980s which she destroyed following a difficult period of her life. It will include the documentary Why I Never Became a Dancer about her teenage years in Margate and other works centred around the seaside town where Emin now offers rent-free space to art students.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is ironic that, in an age when the word “trauma” is so freely applied – in comedy shows as elsewhere – such a compelling claim (the one for which the term PTSD was invented, no less) should be denied. The point is well made that veterans are misunderstood and overlooked in American life – and Posley has plenty more evidence to back it up.I was struck, as I watched The Day I Accidentally Went to War, by how rare narratives like this are, on the comedy stage at least – although maybe we shouldn’t be surprised that few ex-soldiers turn their experiences into solo performances for the arts centre crowd. So much the better for Posley, a writer onApple TV’s Shrinking, whose account of his youth, his military training and service, and his troubled homecoming, can’t help but be interesting to audiences who less often hear these stories firsthand.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIt’s an exuberant if slightly unwieldy 70 minutes, which Posley struggles to engineer into a morality tale for divided modern America. The coda, which includes a sketch about conspiracy theories that comes from another show entirely, feels like an overstretch. But what precedes it is always engaging, as our bouncy host introduces his disciplinarian dad and gambling addict mum, talks us through the narrow range of options that drove him into the National Guard, then relates the irony that found him graduating on 9/11, and duly enlisting to serve in Iraq.The show is at its best when Posley lets the experiences of being a teenager pitched into geopolitical extremis (manning heavy weaponry; burning human faeces; burying his best friend) speak for themselves. When he sermonises (Iraqis are humans too, etc), it’s not always enlightening. Finally, he tells us, he remains proud of his service, and he can likewise be proud of the service rendered with this show, which demystifies soldiery, flies the flag for the plight of veterans – and raises a few good laughs while doing so.AtSoho theatre, London, until 13 SeptExplore more on these topicsComedySoho theatreUS militaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Daniel has a YouTube channel and a podcast, and he’s mates with A-listers in the Bigfoot community. He’s spoken in front of a crowd of 3,000 enthusiasts. Which is even more impressive given Daniel is autistic, and as a young child had selective mutism; his dad says he would turn and face the wall if people came into the room. Daniel also co-directs this documentary about his adventures looking for the big shy guy.He first hit the headlines in his local area after finding a large footprint in woods near his home while out walking with his nan Jill. Demonstrating just how persistent he is, Daniel contacted DNA companies; eventually one offered to test his environmental DNA for free. In among the squirrel and dog DNA they found traces of ancient ape.In the documentary, he heads off to the wilds of the Pacific Northwest for a Bigfoot hunt (an American colleague makes the point that we Brits have nothing properly scary in our woods). First is the matter of getting on the plane. Daniel is terrified of flying and dysregulates on his first attempt.For me, the real story of the film is the wonderful Barnett family. Daniel’s mum Gemma says that they’ve always embraced Daniel’s passions, and their devotion is a joy to watch. His nan Jill and “gramps” Adrian are key players in the film. As for the hunt for Sasquatch, it has something for everyone. Bigfoot believers will gasp as the gang reports spotting something big and dark with huge luminous eyes crossing the trail. Smug sceptics will pooh-pooh the eyewitness accounts and anecdotal evidence. Everyone’s happy.My Bigfoot Life is in UK cinemas from 15 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsAutismreviewsShareReuse this content"

The target is easier than ever and too often, so are the jokes, incisive satire proving hard to nail when the subjects have become so indistinguishably cartoonish. The same has become true of the wealthy in general and recent films that have tried to lampoon either have felt lazy, pointing and laughing at something that’s stopped being funny a long time ago.Roofman review – Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst lift fact-based crime caperRead moreThere’s an initial kick then to the new film from the French music video provocateur turned film-maker Romain Gavras, who finds a more precise section of the VIP area to ridicule: performative environmentalists. As the world continues to burn, artists and those who use that word loosely, have attached themselves to the crisis whether it be to make themselves seem worthier to their fanbase or to make terrible art in its name. There’s both here in Sacrifice, a biting comedy thriller that lands us at another meaningless gala, set inside a remote location in Greece. We arrive with troubled movie star Mike (Chris Evans), panicking over his perceived hair loss (his assistant, played by Sam Richardson, assures him that another trip to Turkey is easily scheduled) and eager to move past a rather embarrassing viral clip of him ranting with a flame-thrower at the premiere of his action vehicle Octavius: The Last Centurion. He’s technically there to do good for the environment but he’s really just there to do good for his image, something that suffers a setback when he sees Bezos-styled billionaire Ben (Vincent Cassel) showing a Daily Mail TikTok of his freakout to others. Ben’s wife Gloria (Salma Hayek) is a pop star whose latest album is designed to be from the perspective of a flood.After Ben announces a new mining scheme that he claims will actually help the ocean (!), Mike takes the stage for another rant, turning himself into an internet joke once again. But things are about to get a lot worse as a group of cultish eco-terrorists (dubbed “Green Isis” on the ground) take the event hostage, pausing a dance performance designed to help save the environment (featuring Charli xcx in a cameo as Mother Nature). They are led by Joan (Anya Taylor-Joy) who announces that the world is days from extinction and to prevent a volcano from erupting, they must throw some celebrities in it.It’s the kind of set-up one might expect from Ruben Östlund and Taylor-Joy herself starred in the adjacent eat-the-rich foodie satire The Menu but Gavras, and co-writer Will Arbery, known for Succession, find their own spark in the witty and well-observed first act. Their jabs are obvious but amusing and there’s something recognisably nauseating about the self-importance of hearing a certain brand of modern celebrity convinced their work will somehow contribute to global betterment. But as we leave the event, as the quest truly begins, Gavras starts to lose his grasp, less confident when tackling a world outside the poppy excess he’s come to know (and sometimes hate) so well. The larking around starts to turn more serious but the film can’t quite decide just how seriously we should be taking it and debates over proven science v fixed beliefs go from circular and repetitive to genuinely baffling when a last actJohn Malkovichappears.What keeps us glued throughout is Evans, who gives an unusually top-tier performance, finding space to make his spiralling actor both pathetically funny and affectingly human. It’s the kind of film one can imagine Evans taking on back when he was still taking chances and before he was completely subsumed within the Marvel universe. He’s technically out now but he’s not really found much of a groove since, getting involved with some of the shoddiest streaming projects of the last few years (Ghosted, Red One, The Gray Man, Pain Hustlers), bad films that he’s also been bad in, adding a worrying question mark to his star status. Gavras has given him perhaps his greatest role to date here and he runs with it. Cassel has far less to do but has fun ragging on him (“I can’t believe I’m going to die next to a Golden Globe loser”) and there’s a wordless yet utterly transfixing performance from Jade Croot, who was similarly chilling in this year’s Sundance horrorRabbit Trap.They make for a fine cast (Hayek is underused yet in small moments provides a reminder of just how great she can be at comedy) but Gavras leaves them and us stranded on the way to his out-there ending. Even before we’re looking into a volcano, Sacrifice has fallen over the edge.Sacrifice is screening at theToronto film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewToronto film festivalFestivalsChris EvansAnya Taylor-JoySalma HayekCharli xcxreviewsShareReuse this content"

Robbie (Tom Pelphrey) is a binman by day, coping with the death of his brother while looking after his kids and niece, and maybe even looking for love. By night, though, he and his mate Cliff (Raúl Castillo) dress in Halloween costumes and burgle members of a drug-dealing biker gang. Enter Mark Ruffalo’s Tom, an FBI agent dealing with his own family bereavement, and put on the case with an inexperienced taskforce before a turf war escalates.

Furthermore, at the time, Colbert had justcriticizedCBS for paying $16m tosettlea lawsuit filed by Trump over the president’sclaimsthat the network edited footage of an interview with Kamala Harris to make her look better in her unsuccessful White House run in 2024.Legal experts widely believed CBS could defeat Trump’s claims of defamation in court, and on his show, Colbert dismissed the settlement as “a big fat bribe”.Colbert announced three days later that he had been informed of his show’s cancellation. Trump – who had frequently been the butt of jokes on the Late Show – relished the news, posting on his Truth Social platform: “I absolutely love that Colbert was fired.”The Late Show host replied that it had always been a dream of his for a sitting president to celebrate the end of his career andtoldTrump on air: “Go fuck yourself.”Regulators at the Trump administration-controlled Federal Communications Commission laterapprovedParamount’s sale to Skydance.CBS’s chair of television media, George Cheeks, in August tried to separate the cancellation of Colbert’s show from the politics of Trump’s second presidency. Instead, he blamed financial headwinds confronting the late-night talkshow format.“The challenge in late-night is that the advertising marketplace is in significant secular decline,” Cheekssaidat a news conference after Skydance’s takeover of Paramount. “We are huge fans of Colbert – we love the show.“Unfortunately, the economics made it a challenge for us to keep going.”The US entertainment news outletVarietynoted that many television industry insiders saw the Late Show’s Emmy win on Sunday as a reaction to public consternation generated by its cancellation at the hands of Paramount.Cancelling Colbert, bribery, an $8bn deal: what’s going on at Paramount?Read moreColbert’s Late Show had amassed more than 30 Emmy nominations before Sunday’s victory by director Jim Hoskinson.

I still enjoy the dancefloor, but I always know when to leaveMarcus BarnesMon 8 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTShareMost of my adult life has revolved around music: clubs, bars, festivals, house parties – anywhere I could dance to loud music. I loved how energising and cathartic it was to get immersed in it, to lose myself a little and move my body expressively without judgment. I’d get so absorbed that I would lose track of time; once, at Burning Man, I was awake for 36 hours exploring the festival, meeting new people and partying.When I became a DJ, these kinds of events increased. Late nights out would last until the morning. Often, they became marathon weekend sessions, which ran from Friday night to Sunday lunchtime. It wasn’t all dancing and shenanigans – there would be moments to sit around and chat with people, too. I’d be out at least three times a week. Even though I’d get tired, I would always find some way to push through to the early hours because I was scared to miss out on things. Fomo (fear of missing out) drove many of my decisions.My work never suffered but my mental health did. I started to feel anxious and dangerously close to burnout. Consumed with self-loathing, I wanted to stop but couldn’t figure out how – until I went on a 10-day silent meditation course.It was then that I realised the life I was living was unsustainable. But it took a while to unravel my hedonism and habitual indulgence. I went sober because I wanted to rid myself of the brain fog and fatigue I was often bogged down with.The one change that worked: I abandoned my cynicism – and joined Europe’s biggest gay choirRead moreLearning to navigate nights out without a crutch to keep me going sparked an important shift in my approach to parties and festivals. Instead of giving in to Fomo, I have learned to listen to what my body is telling me rather than ignoring the signs. Tired legs usually spark a well-earned sit down or, in some cases, I will call it a night and get myself home to bed. This kind of behaviour was unheard of between the ages of 17 and 37, when I had my last drink. Back then, I would keep going even when I was exhausted.It hasn’t been easy, though. Being sober is hard work. Not having an easy escape can be very challenging. I had to learn how to be more confident and expressive without ingesting anything. Dancing while sober is still fun but it’s tricky dealing with how self-conscious you feel.Responding to my body’s needs consciously and waving goodbye to Fomo have given me a real sense of stability. Every time I’ve made the decision to have an early night or given myself time to rest has reinforced my self-respect and self-love. The gradual accumulation of healthy decisions has been life-changing for me.The dancefloor has been my sanctuary for a long time. Now I can happily get my fill and go home when the time is right, without ever feeling as if I’m missing out. That peace of mind is priceless.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But it was the 24-time slam winner’s first-round walk-on jacket that caused the most noise: a white windbreaker with laser-cut pieces of leather layered to form a low relief of a world map, and dotted with coloured tennis balls to match different court surfaces..While tennis has always had a close relationship with fashion, or at least, style – fromFred Perry’s sharp slacks andSuzanne Lenglen’s pleated skirt and headscarf to Andre Agassi’sdenim shorts(originally made for John McEnroe, who turned them down) andSerena Williams’ catsuit– the walk from locker room to baseline has become its own catwalk.View image in fullscreenCourt couture … Suzanne Lenglen, one of tennis’s original style queens.Photograph: George Rinhart/Corbis/Getty ImagesAdd to that last year’s hit tennis film,Challengers, and a fresh crop of personable stars with exciting play styles, and there is now a greater appetite for a sport that had rather lost its cultural way. US Open ticket sales areup 70% in the past five years.“Fashion brands of all price ranges are heavily interested in tennis right now because the sport is hot, and they follow the eyeballs and money,” says Jessica Schiffer, a fashion business journalist who writes theHard Court newsletter. Behemoths like Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Bottega Veneta have all brought high-profile players on board (Jannik Sinner, Alcaraz and Lorenzo Musetti respectively) and smaller, boutique non-athleisure brands are creating lines that reference thetenniscore aesthetic. Meanwhile, Depop, the second-hand clothing app, hasreported a 53% increasein searches for tennis skirts.The wealthy, upper-class roots of the sport have long seen heritage brands associated with it, but now the likes of Rolex and Ralph Lauren are no longer dominating play.View image in fullscreenSport goes frow … Venus Williams in Lacoste at the Met Gala.Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/ReutersVenus Williams has a prominent relationship with Lacoste – she even wore a Pelagia Kolotouros-created dress tothe Met Gala– but this year she worked with her stylist, Ronald Burton III, to further wow the Flushing Meadows front row.

While Nike might be ensuring Osaka dazzles and Alcaraz catches the eye in a lushplumtwinset, its ready-to-wear tennis apparel has trended towards drab.

But, a lot of the time, it’s getting a bit Liberace, a little Las Vegas, in an attempt to steal the show. So I think, sometimes, it’s actually a bit anti-style.”Underneath that somewhat gaudy Djokovic jacket?

The easiest way to make the necessary holes in your sliced bread is with a round pastry cutter – or a heart-shaped one for fun. Break the eggs into their bread ‘baskets’, then fry up their “hats” to go alongside. To make this a grownup rather than a nursery dinner, serve with lemon-and-paprika-spiked chard, or spinach or kale, if that’s what you have; I am growing a surfeit of chard, so I always need new ways to use it up.Eggs in a basket with smoky chardPrep10 minCook10 minServes2(but scale up if you’re hungry)2tbsp olive oil1garlic clove, peeled and finely sliced150g rainbow chard, roughly chopped1tsp hot smoked paprika1tsp flaky sea saltJuice of ½ lemon2 large slices goodwhite bread or sourdough2 mediumeggs50gGreek yoghurt, to servePut a tablespoon of the oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat, add the garlicand fry for 30 seconds. Add the chard and paprika, and stir-fry for three to four minutes, just until the chard has wilted (this will take less time if it’s quite young). Season with a half-teaspoon of flaky sea salt and the lemon juice, then taste and add more salt as needed. Transfer the chard to a bowl and wipe out the pan with kitchen roll.While the chard is cooking, use a round cutter to stamp out a circle from the centre of each slice of bread. Put the remaining oil in the now-empty chard pan on a medium heat, then lay in the bread (one slice at a time, if the pan’s not big enough for both) and its cut-out circle, too, if there’s room and fry for a minute just to get a little colour. Flip over, break an egg into the hole in the centre and fry for a minute or two, until the white is just set and the yolk runny; if you prefer your eggs over easy, by all means flip for 30 seconds to seal the other side.Scatter each basket with a pinch of sea salt and serve with the smoky chard, fried bread circles and a big spoon of yoghurt alongside.Explore more on these topicsEggsQuick and easyFoodSnacksBreadVegetablesMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

But footfall remained low. “Eventually I decided to go back in time: to themed nights,” he said. “I really went for it – and the success was immediate, lasting and is still growing.”The Ship is now bustling with locals not just keen to take part in its regular quiz nights, Tina Turner nights and Evenings with Elvis – but eager to bring their homemade crafts to the pub’s annual raft race from the local harbour – last year, more than 2,000 people attended – and its Punch and Judy events (“We ostensibly hold it for the kids but everyone comes,” said Dawson). He somehow had real tanks at the pub for VE Day and – his favourite – holds a Rocky Horror Time Warp dance every Halloween.“Theme nights used to be popular 20 years ago, then they dropped out of fashion,” he said. “But my experience is that they’re becoming wildly popular again, with younger customers discovering communal, themed silliness for the first time – and older customers rediscovering the joy from their youth.”View image in fullscreenA Shakespeare play being performed in a pub garden.Photograph: FullerDawson is not alone. Across the UK, pubs are throwing their doors open to themed events: opera under canvas, Shakespeare in garden marquees, film nights in tepees. Clay making, lampshade painting, pinot and Picasso, and floral design workshops now take place in venues once defined by beer mats and televised football.But it is not about novelty, say experts – it is about necessity. “Theme nights have become key to getting people out of their houses and into pubs and bars,” said Michael Kill, the chief executive officer of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA).Kill points to research from the NTIA’s latest Night Time Economy Market Monitor that found the number of themed bars and pubs increased by 5.6% in the second quarter of 2025 – and by 21.4% in the past 12 months.“We’re revisiting the successes of the past: going back to having fun and not taking ourselves too seriously,” he said. “Themed nights had gone in abeyance over the last few years: the last five years have really just been about keeping your head above water but we’re now seeing a resurgence. Themed nights are the one thing that’s bucking the trend and showing growth.”Emma McClarkin, the chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, agreed. “It’s a major revival,” she said. “Some themes are traditional – murder mysteries, quizzes – but people are also putting on really imaginative events. They’re trying to inspire people to think differently about the pub.”The crisis underpinning this creative revival is acute. Between January and June 2025, 209 pubs in England and Wales closed permanently – an average of eight a week. In April 2025 alone, 67 pubs entered administration.More than 20% of UK pubs – more than 8,100 venues – are technically insolvent. Of those, 4,604 are in what is described as the “maximum risk” category, up more than 500 from the previous year.Cathy Olver, the retail director at StarPubs, said themed events were part of a survival strategy. “People still want to go out,” she said. “But now, you have to give them a reason.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “Life is complicated, judgmental. These nights offer a kind of comfort.”Bickle sees the industry’s strategy as one of inclusive curation. “Opera and Shakespeare might bring in an older audience. Murder mystery or live comedy could skew younger. You need to attract both.”The movement is driving innovation: some pubs offer early evening readings, open mic poetry, or wine-and-jazz nights designed to fit between school runs and last orders. “People want a richer experience,” said McClarkin. “It’s not just about the drink any more. Themed nights give people that sense of occasion, something to talk about, something to come back for.”And, crucially, something to keep the lights on. As margins shrink – publicans make on average 12p profit per pint – the need to offer more than alcohol is no longer optional, it is, for many, the only option left.Explore more on these topicsHospitality industryFood & drink industryPubsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Prop styling: Anna Wilkins. Food styling assistant: Catarina Cardoso.FoodSweet-and-sour figs and roast chicken: Ben Lippett’s savoury fig recipesA good fig brings gorgeous late-summer notes to your dinner tableBen LippettMon 8 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTShareThere are a handful of moments on the culinary calendar that feel like striking gold: rhubarb in January, peas and broad beans in spring, summer cherries and tomatoes, and, for just a few short weeks in late-summer, figs. Typically, they might be torn over yoghurt and granola for breakfast or baked into a tart with frangipane, but they belong in the savoury kitchen, too. Combined with salt, savoury ingredients and a little vinegar, a good fig will bring a gorgeous sweet-sour note to your dinner table.Polenta with sweet-and-sour figs and pecorinoAs the warmer months come to an end, I like to cook with both comfort and freshness in mind. Rich, buttery, warming polenta is offset with a vibrant, bright, jammy topping of onions, rosemary and torn figs. Shave over some pecorino for a funky, savoury twang, and you’ve got a dish that’ll scratch that late-summer itch.Prep15minCook45minServes4For the polenta250ml whole milk150g coarse cornmeal30g butterFor the sweet-and-sour figsOlive oil2 red onions,peeled and thinly sliced10g rosemary(2-3 sprigs),leaves stripped and finely choppedSea salt and black pepper20g brown sugar20ml aged balsamic vinegar6-8 ripe figsPecorino romano, to servePut 600ml water and the milk in a pan, then whisk in the cornmeal. Set the pan over a medium heat and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Turn down the heat to low and let it tick over, stirring every now and then – if things start to get a bit too thick, add a splash of water to loosen. You don’t need to stand there whisking away the entire time; just check in on the polenta every five to 10 minutes, and give it a good stir.Meanwhile, set a frying pan on a medium heat and add a shot of olive oil. Add the onions, half the rosemary and a pinch of salt, then toss in the warm oil and cook for 10-12 minutes, or until the onions are starting to caramelise. Add the sugar and vinegar, and continue cooking until the onions are jammy. Tear the figs in half, drop them into the pan, stir to coat, and finish with the remaining rosemary.Once the polenta has had 45 minutes or so in the pan, whisk in the butter. This is the moment to adjust the texture; I like my polenta gently to relax into the bowl. If it’s too thick, add a little water or milk; if it’s too thin, keep cooking. Spoon the polenta into warm bowls and top with the jammy onions. Use a mandoline or cheese grater to shave some pecorino over the top and serve.Roast chicken legs with beans and figsView image in fullscreenBen Lippett’s roast chicken legs with beans and figs.Photograph: Matthew Hague/The Guardian. Food styling: Lucy Turnbull. Prop styling: Anna Wilkins. Food styling assistant: Catarina Cardoso.A chicken leg is, for my money, the ultimate midweek ingredient. With very little effort, it really sings and can be cooked with little hands-on time. This traybake uses slightly under-ripe figs, orange, fennel seeds and capers to create a chicken and bean dish that’ll fly into your weekly rotation. When out of season, swap the figs for dried fruit such as apricots, dates or prunes.Prep10minCook1 hr 15 minServes44 skin-on, bone-in chicken legsFine sea salt3 onions,peeled and cut into wedges4 tbsp capers5 garlic cloves,peeled, gently squashed with a knife, but left wholePeeled zest of 1 orange1 tbsp fennel seedsOlive oil700g jarcooked white beans,not drained6-8 slightly underripe figs2-3 tbsp sherry vinegar15g fresh oreganoExtra-virgin olive oilHeat the oven to 245C (225C fan)/480F/gas 9½, and season the chicken legs with salt. Put the onion wedges, capers, garlic, orange zest and fennel seeds in a roasting tin that’s just big enough to hold the chicken legs in a single layer, then drizzle generously with olive oil, season with salt and give everything a good mix. Sit the chicken legs on top, slide into the oven for 25 minutes, then turn down the heat to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and roast for another 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is very tender.Take the tin out of the oven and lift out the chicken legs, leaving all the cooking juices behind. Add the beans and their liquid to the tray, then cut the figs into 1cm slices and toss them in, too. Sit the chicken back on top and return to the oven for 10-15 minutes, until the juices have reduced and thickened.Take out of the the oven, set aside the chicken and finish off the beans with the orange juice and a splash of sherry vinegar. Scatter fresh oregano over the top and mingle with the beans. Divide the beans and figs between four plates and top with a roast chicken leg. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and serve.How I Cook: A Chef’s Guide to Really Good Home Cooking, by Ben Lippett, is published by HarperCollins at £26.

Back then it was rare to see St George’s cross flags as frequently as he does driving around now. The flags are seen asdivisive and dangerous in a climate of anti-migrant protestswhere political discourse is fixated on deportations, small boats and threats to withdraw the UK from human rights frameworks. It has left individuals who have sought refuge in the UK feeling anxious, upset and fearing repercussions.“Immigrants, they just want to have a better life. If our country was safe, was all right, we would never leave,” said Mohammad, who asked to use only his first name fearing reprisals. After facing persecution as a practising Christian in Shia-majority Iran, Mohammad left his life behind at 28 suddenly and without a plan.“These people who are judging us, I wish they used to live in a different country, not their own country, to understand how heavy it is, how difficult it is,” he added.For years, successive UK governments have struggled to accommodate thousands seeking refuge, despite refugees and asylum seekers comprising a small percentage –about 16% in 2024– of those who migrate to the UK.Now with Reform on the Labour party’s tail and gaining political momentum on anti-migration rhetoric decried by critics as“ugly” and “destructive”, Labour hasintroduced tougher asylum policies, decisively reshuffled its cabinet, promoting Shabana Mahmood to home secretary, and is planning housing alternatives forasylum seekersas it facescriticism from senior figuresand campaigners to be more inclusive and pluralistic.Shabana Mahmood to host Five Eyes meeting on people-smugglingRead moreBut for Kolbassia Haoussou, 50, who sought refuge in the UK under Tony Blair’s government having fled persecution and torture in central Africa, the hostile environment is familiar. Now as the director of survivor leadership at Freedom from Torture, he worries that if the current political discourse continues, the language willincite people furtherand damage Britain’s international reputation.“Sometimes, I wish I was not alive to witness all those things that are happening,” said Haoussou, who crossed the Channel years ago. “I had so [many] high standards of this country, living through this is very difficult for me.”Haoussou, who received an MBE in 2020 for his service to torture and sexual violence survivors, said his growing anxiety had stopped him from watching the news.Recent demonstrations outside hotels where asylum seekers are held have changed his habits, as he fears being caught in the middle of a protest or at the end of a racist altercation.It is a double standard rooted in racism, he added: “With Ukraine, we opened our doors, we’re so compassionate. Now these people are living in hotels and they don’t look like white British and they want to tear down the hotels.”View image in fullscreenClare Jones hosts refugees and asylum seekers at her flat in south London.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianAs the government struggles to accommodate thousands of people who have applied for asylum, individual households have helped bridge the gap to those in need. Since 2016, the charity Refugees at Home has placed more than 7,000 refugees and asylum seekers from more than 100 countries with 1,700 hosts across the UK.One such household is that of Jonathan Wittenberg and Nicola Solomon, who have opened their home to assist refugees and asylum seekers, including Mohammad.Wittenberg said the decision to share their house in London felt right as they are empty nesters. As a son of refugees who fled Nazi Germany, they feel strongly compelled to help others. The experience has been humbling and moving, he added.“There’s limited housing and health facilities in this country, it’s heavily populated and it can’t be a home to absolutely everybody, but as Safe Passage have said, there needs to be a clear safe way of accessing this country to make one’s appeal for asylum and a clear way of getting that sorted,” said Wittenberg, a rabbi in London.Hosts the Guardian spoke to said the experience had been enriching and they described their guests as eager to integrate and contribute. Some families said they picked up individuals from hotels after they were kicked out on short notice after receiving decisions on their cases. Others have since checked in on those in government accommodation amid recentanti-immigrant protests.Clare Jones first offered her spare room as emergency accommodation in 2022, but wishes she had done it sooner. While she first began hosting to help, the experience of hosting individuals from Yemen, Afghanistan and sub-Saharan Africa has been enriching in an unbelievable way, she said.“It’s just really sad to hear the way that people talk about people, human beings,” said Jones of the current discourse.“Everybody is so generous and open-hearted, they’re so grateful and appreciative to be here and be part of this society. It’s very upsetting to imagine that they might be on the receiving end of abuse.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumMigrationReform UKShabana MahmoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bringing a set amount of cash stopped me overspending, especially with Apple Pay making it so easy to do so. Edinburgh nightlife is still majority cash-friendly spots which made this easy. Plus, it’s a good way to keep your phone safely tucked away in your bag, reducing the risk of losing or breaking it mid-night out.Tara Russell, University of Edinburgh, social anthropology (graduated 2024)View image in fullscreenTara Russell: ‘Use cash on a night out.’Photograph: Tara RussellBuy good quality items, even if they are more expensive. Over the years, I had to replace a lot of things because I often opted for the cheapest choice. The replacements add up, and it’s much more sustainable and cost-effective to choose high-quality bedding or kitchenware that will last beyond university years.Sabah Salam, University of York, English literature (2020-23)View image in fullscreenSabah Salam: ‘Buy good-quality items.’Photograph: Sabah SalamMake the most of the chances you are already paying for, so yes, attend your lectures, but also join societies. Whatever you are interested in, whether it’s sports, languages or student theatre, there will almost certainly be a student society for it and it’s one of the easiest and most subsidised ways to pick up a new skill as an adult.Also, check at the beginning of the year what opportunities your university might fund. Lots of universities have grants that help students to travel and complete internships abroad. You don’t want to get to the end of three years and wish you had made the most of when your university might have paid for your flight to China.Sara Rourke, University of Oxford, English language and literatureSara Rourke: ‘Check what opportunities your university might fund.’Photograph: Sara RourkeWhen it comes to nights out, I’d recommend trying to premeditate your spending: look online at the venues you’re visiting and search for menus and offers – that way you can budget towards how much you’ll spend at places and avoid nasty surprises.Alfie Howlett, University of Gloucestershire, journalismView image in fullscreenAlfie Howlett: ‘Premeditate your spending.’Photograph: Alfie HowlettThough not all universities offer it, sharing a room in the first year can be a great way to save money – for me it more than halved my rent (I spent just £3,000 for the whole year) and gave me a best friend to go out clubbing with. While it certainly isn’t for everyone, you may find it to be a fun and cost-effective way to avoid the sky-high rents that students normally have to face.Rohan Sathyamoorthy, University of Bath, politics and international relationsExplore more on these topicsStudent financeStudentsUniversitiesHigher educationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We recognise how important this is to the charity.”TfL, meanwhile, blamed it all on Thames Water for submitting incomplete applications. Its spokesperson said: “We have been working with Thames Water to resolve a number of issues with its application, and we continue to handle this in line with the longstanding agreements around permissions and timescales required for these works.”The good news was that, after my contact, an installation date was agreed for late May.

The 1985 Levi’s 501 advertmade a starof its model, and presented an image in keeping with the clothing brand’s all-American style.But could that deep-seated association with the US prove an achilles heel? Last week, in its UK accounts,Levi’s issued a warningthat “rising anti-Americanism as a consequence of the Trump tariffs and governmental policies” could affect its sales in Britain. The idea is not unique – attitudes towards Tesla in the UK and Europedeteriorated when Elon Musk was closely associated with Trump. However, the Levi’s warning raises the question – could fashion become the latest sector affected by anti-American sentiment outside the US?Retail and brand experts are divided. Achim Berg, the founder of the Germany-based fashion and luxury thinktankFashionSights, was surprised by the Levi’s warning – he sees the company as a different case from something such as Tesla orAmazon, which are “directly associated with the US [government]”. This is in contrast to other companies. “I haven’t seen any reports about people holding back on Apple, holding back on Netflix. If you think about it, we are all using plenty of US products and services every day.”However, Catherine Shuttleworth, a retail consultant and the chief executive of Savvy Marketing, does think there is a risk. “People arethinking twice about going on holiday to Americaand about buying some of those products,” she says. “If I was [a retailer of an] all-American product, I would be thinking about how I presented myself differently in terms of my advertising and marketing.”View image in fullscreenA scene from the 1985 Levi’s 501 advert featuring Nick Kamen.Photograph: PR Image/Levi’s 501Any sign of an anti-Americanism trend would cause a headache for an industry benefiting from the popularity of Americana and preppy looks.Labels such as Hollister, Ralph Lauren and Brandy Melville are popular – the last opened a new store in London in June.Hollister’s parent company, Abercrombie & Fitch, posted a 12% rise in profit in itsEurope, the Middle East and Africa division in 2024 and searches for Polo Ralph Lauren increased 27% on the resale app Depop between July and August.Alex Goat, the chief executive of the youth-focused creative agencyLivity, says this look plugs into an idealised version of the US that is served in popular TV shows such as The Summer I Turned Pretty and My Life with the Walter Boys. “They are not reflecting the political issues that are going on in the States at the moment. They’re the same halcyon American days that we all probably thought about when we were growing up,” she says. “If that’s what you think America is, then where’s the challenge to buy from brands like that?”Emma Davidson, the fashion features director of Dazed Digital, agrees this look is not a direct correlation with an all-American patriotism. “We call it preppy and varsity style but it feels one step removed from what it once stood for,” she says.The domestic markets for some of these brands absolutely blow their international sales out of the waterSavvy Marketing’s Catherine ShuttleworthExperts do, however, agree that overt patriotism is unlikely to export well. “If you were Levi’s you wouldn’t be what you’ve been leaning into [stars and stripes],” Shuttleworth says. “You might use influencers that are not as American perhaps.”Davidson points to a cultural example. “It surprised me that Beyoncé was plastered in stars and stripes throughout theCowboy Cartertour,” she says. “It felt really out of step with what’s going on in the world.”While these are global brands, appealing to US customers is an integral part of their business. “The domestic markets for some of these brands absolutely blow their international sales out of the water,” Shuttleworth says. “They will have to think strategically about who they appeal to in the short term.” With tariffs in place on imports, there is also an opportunity here – with consumers potentially shifting, as Trump hopes, to “buying American”.Patriotic and conservative marketing can play out well with consumers who voted for Trump, as has been proven withAmerican Eagle’s US campaignwith the blond, blue-eyed Sydney Sweeney opining that she has “great genes”. With an outcry on social media, one TikTok userdescribed itas “dog whistle to the rise of conservatism in this country”. True to form, Trump praised Sweeney on social media.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its chief executive, Jay Schottenstein, credited the Sweeney ad,arguingit helped “an uptick in customer awareness, engagement and comparable sales”.In Canada, hostility towards US products is growing – withreportsof shoppers turning American goods upside down on supermarket shelves so they can be avoided by fellow shoppers, and a slump in sales of Jack Daniel’s, a brand that has Americana central to its marketing.Customer reaction is typically not as direct and not as consequential and consistent as people tend to thinkAchim Berg of FashionSightsCould a similar boycott happen with fashion brands in the UK? Shuttleworth is sceptical. “What cost are our principles?” she says. “We say one thing but we do another. I don’t likeDonald Trumpvery much but if Bobbi Brown launches a new range of makeup tomorrow, don’t think I won’t buy it because it’s American. I’ll self-justify.”Berg argues that consumer awareness around brands is less than the media suggests. “In my experience, customer reaction is typically not as direct and not as consequential and consistent as people tend to think,” he says. “You could see that during the ‘wokeness’ wave, during the sustainability wave. Despite a certain reputation, consumers were still in love with certain brands that were not famous for being very woke or being very sustainable.”Goat says this is particularly true with young people. “It’s like ‘the world is burning, and I want to act on that but I still want to be able to buy clothes that are affordable.’” (She is quick to point out this is not the first generation of young people with such a paradox – “younger people are always more politically involved and still also want to look good and feel good and do that on a budget,” she says.)While Goat does not totally rule out a distancing from American brands, she suggests that young people in the UK are more likely to boycott those with links to Israel because of its government’s actions in Gaza. “It’s a humanitarian crisis versus a very difficult political situation.”If a significant boycott of US brands does materialise, Shuttleworth believes it would spread online. “It’s like: ‘How can we hurt Trump? Probably only in the economy,’” she says. “If enough people get behind it, it becomes a thing; social media can grow really quickly.”Explore more on these topicsFashionRetail industryTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsInternational tradeEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m sitting at a vast outdoor table in Herefordshire looking out over rows of vines. On the horizon, the Malvern Hills ripple towards the Black Mountains; in front of me is a selection of local produce: cheeses from Monkland Dairy, 6 miles away, salad leaves from Lane Cottage (8 miles), charcuterie from Trealy Farm (39 miles), cherries from Moorcourt Farm (3 miles), broccoli quiche (2 miles) and glasses of sparkling wine, cassis and apple juice made just footsteps away. This off-grid feast is the final stop on White Heron Estate’s ebike farm tour – and I’m getting the lie of the land with every bite.View image in fullscreenBefore eating, our small group pedalled along a two-hour route so pastorally pretty it would make Old MacDonald sigh. Skirting purple-hued borage fields, we’ve zipped in and out of woodland, down rows of apple trees and over patches of camomile, and learned how poo from White Heron’s chickens is burnt in biomass boilers to generate heat. “Providing habitats for wildlife is important, but we need to produce food as well,” says our guide Jo Hilditch, who swapped a career in PR for farming when she inherited the family estate 30 years ago.View image in fullscreenShe’s electric: the writer gets on her ebike.Photograph: Rhiannon BattenThe tours offer an immersive way of seeing British agriculture in action. Pausing in the estate’s blackcurrant fields, Jo pulls bottles of chilled Ribena from a basket for us to drink (White Heron produces 5% of Ribena’s blackcurrant supply) and encourages us to taste the fruit: fat and sweet, the berries are a whole different entity to the wincingly sharp little beads growing in my own garden.As if by arrangement, bells start ringing from the church’s stand-alone belfry as I cycle bySo lyrical do I wax about the blackcurrants that, after I arrive at my accommodation for the night, the estate’s homely Field Cottage, there’s a knock at the door: the delivery of a punnet to take home. I add it to the cottage’s guest hamper, which is brimming with tangy Worcester Hop cheese, local raspberries, some of the estate’s own apple juice and a miniature of its treacly, sharp-sweet cassis.I don’t have to worry about working it off. The following day I’m back on the ebike on a new self-guided ride around north Herefordshire. One of a handful of routes the estate has curated around the region’s farm shops, cider-makers, cheese producers and farm-to-fork restaurants, the trails link up some delectable pit stops in different corners of the county, some of which feature on Visit Herefordshire’s new food safaris.View image in fullscreenThe estate’s ebikes come into their own on some of the rougher tracksSetting out while the early morning mist is still loitering over the estate’s orchards, I swing over an old grass-covered railway line on to a quiet lane running between fields of hay, then wheel along to pretty Pembridge, with its rows of tipsy-angled black-and-white buildings. As if by arrangement, the bells start ringing from the church’s stand-alone belfry as I pass, giving the impression of a medieval rocket about to launch. I stop in the village stores to pick up a loaf from Peter Cooks Bread and a coffee at Bloom & Grind before pedalling on to Eardisland.An e-biking tour of England’s newest forestRead moreThe mist lifts as I arrive, revealing a picturesque swirl of half-timbered buildings, a dainty 17th-century dovecote and an elegant bridge over the River Arrow. There’s no time to dawdle, though. I’m only partway into my 29-mile route and it’s mid-morning already.I cycle down blissfully empty lanes to Monkland Dairy, set up three decades ago by ex-teacher Kaz Hindle and her husband, Mark. Having “bought a cheese shop because of a drunken dinner”, Kaz tells me the dairy came about when one of the shop’s employees mentioned her grandmother’s 1917 recipe for cheese. The grandmother turned out to be Ellen Yeld, one-time “chief dairy instructress” for Herefordshire, so the recipe was a good one. The Hindles refined it further to produce Little Hereford, a cheddar-like cheese that’s now the dairy’s flagship product.View image in fullscreenThe tour offers pit stops to refuel on local produce.Photograph: Rhiannon BattenWith Kaz semi-retired, the cheesemaking side of things has been taken over by ex-chef and former customer Dean Storey. Showing me the cheese cave and the dairy’s vintage cast-iron presses, Storey tells that me he makes 30 to 40 Little Herefords a week and up to 300 of the dairy’s deliciously creamy blue monks, plus some “more controversial” cheeses such as ones featuring garlic and chive; “My kids love it in pasta,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lunch beckons a few fields further on. The Riverside at Aymestrey is a pretty black-and-white inn beside the River Lugg. The hillside above it operates as a semi-wild kitchen garden. Among a bounty of damsons, cobnuts, jerusalem artichokes, fennel, lovage, kale, gooseberries and apples are pigs and chickens. “The garden started as a lockdown project and now we have 2.5 acres (1 hectare),” says chef-patron Andy Link, as he shows me around. “It means we can work in food metres rather than food miles.”View image in fullscreenSoup at the Riverside at Aymestrey, which is supplied by its own semi-wild kitchen gardenI’m transported back to the garden when I bite into an appetiser of summer veg croustade – a mouthful of crunchy peas, beans and mint enveloped with crushed seeds. It’s followed by trout cured in gin and lemon verbena, with gooseberries and tendrils of sea purslane, then fall-apart local beef fillet and cheek from a farm 11 miles away. But it’s the dainty, cloud-like savarin I have for dessert that keeps this hyper-Herefordshire meal on my mind as I wobble back on to my bike for the ride back to White Heron; it’s soaked in a delicate syrup flavoured with pine tips.The following morning, I do some foraging of my own, driving south to Longtown to meet wild food expert Liz Knight, of Forage Fine Foods,on her local patch. As we walk out along an old drovers’ road to the fields past her converted barn, Liz teaches me to look at the landscape not just as a view but as a foodscape. There may be an extraordinary panorama of the Cat’s Back hill across the valley, but we try to keep our eyes down: beneath our feet is pineapple weed, whose fruity flowers can be used to top salads or spice up cordials, broadleaf plantain, which can be fried like kale chips, and docks, whose ground seeds can be baked in bread and crackers.View image in fullscreenGoing wild: Liz Knight of Forage Fine Foods.Photograph: Rhiannon BattenAt one point, we come across an ancient linden tree, whose colossal gnarled trunk makes it a contender for the real-life Magic Faraway Tree, though Liz says that its real sorcery lies in its cucumber-scented flowers; delicious on salads, they are also said to help calm the nervous system. Nearby is a patch of yarrow. A forager’s cure-all, yarrow’s many medicinal properties include calming bites and stings, balancing hormones and soothing sore throats. Picking a few heads, we stroll back to Liz’s kitchen to steep the flowers with honeysuckle in vodka to use as a tincture.Back home that evening, I make a salad using radishes, runner beans and soft dorstone cheese from the Oakchurch Farm Shop, another pin on Herefordshire’s food safari map. As I slice the veg, I think of everyone I’ve met over the last few days. Seeing such careful tending of food first-hand has left me not just with the lie of the land, I realise, but with the experience of truly savouring it too.The trip was provided by White Heron; its two- to three-hour ebikefarm tour and tastingis£50pp;full-day slow cycle rides£80pp; self-catering accommodation sleeps four, from £509 for three nights.Half-day foraging courseswith Liz Knightfrom£55pp. For more informationseevisitherefordshire.co.ukExplore more on these topicsCycling holidaysFood and drinkEngland holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysBritish food and drinkFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In fact, it seems a new one arrives every decade – two were announced recently, including Netflix’s spin on Pride & Prejudice. Yet, one adaptation has been shamefully overlooked: Gurinder Chadha’s Bride & Prejudice.A cross-cultural, British-and-Bollywood-meets-Hollywood take on Austen’s most famous novel, the film is pure joy – a riot of original musical numbers, colourful costumes, chaos, culture clashes and, of course, romance.‘Visceral, sensual wonders’: why The Talented Mr Ripley is my feelgood movieRead moreYou may think it wouldn’t work, but it does. Released after the huge success of Bend It Like Beckham, Chadha spent two years filming Bride & Prejudice across three continents. It’s a homage to the Bollywood films she grew up watching with a modern, western twist – a cinematic expression of her hybrid identity.The comfort lies in the beloved storyline, effortlessly familiar. Themes of class, social expectations and (yes) prejudices are refracted through Bollywood tropes and melodrama. We leap from Amritsar to Goa, then LA and London. More than that, Austen’s world fits surprisingly well into contemporary India, where arranged marriages equal security and status. These parallels make the novel an ideal fit for a 21st-century Indian retelling.The Bennets become the Bakshis – a middle-class family from Amritsar with four daughters to marry off. Our heroine is Lalita, played by the former Miss World and Bollywood movie icon Aishwarya Rai. Like Elizabeth Bennet, she is clever, full of gumption and occasionally arrogant. Reviews were mixed, but unanimous about Rai’s beauty. Branded as a “stately beauty” (the Guardian) and reduced to a “world-class hottie” (Rolling Stone), she proved to be both dazzling on screen and deft enough to bridge Bollywood spectacle and British sensibility.At a wedding party, we meet our Mr Darcy – reimagined as Will Darcy (Martin Henderson), an American real-estate tycoon. He arrives with best friend Balraj (Naveen Andrews) and Balraj’s sister Kiran (Indira Varma). So begins the east-meets-west culture clash. “Watch out, Darcy, he’s about to turn into the Indian MC Hammer,” quips Kiran, as the film’s best dance number kicks off. During this exuberant sequence, Lalita shines and Darcy falls for her but his comments at their initial meeting reek of western superiority, and Lalita, quick to judge, writes him off.Balraj invites Lalita and her older sister, Jaya (Namrata Shirodkar) to Goa, where Darcy is viewing a potential hotel purchase. Lalita’s impassioned rebuttal of his motives: “You think this is India? Five-star comfort with a bit of culture thrown in? Well, I don’t want you to turn India into a theme park” – feels just as relevant today.Chadha adds intersectionality to Austen’s tale. Class here is inseparable from culture and colonialism. India’s recent independence looms in the background and western misreading of Indian identity and values are woven into the story.In Goa, we encounter George Wickham (Daniel Gillies), shirtless and smouldering, intriguing Lalita while undermining Darcy’s reputation. Fun fact: it’s common to include an “item number” in Bollywood films, where a glamorous performer takes centre stage for a showpiece song that rarely aids the storyline. Keeping this tradition, American singer Ashanti delivers a sultry Bollywood-R&B fusion performance.From here, the plot broadly follows Austen’s. Along the way, we meet Mr Kohli (Nitin Ganatra) AKA Mr Collins, or as Mrs Bakshi states, “your father’s sister’s husband’s sister’s son”. He’s an exaggerated portrait of a first-generation Indian-American, enamoured with the west yet fixated on marriage. Lalita inevitably sees Darcy’s better qualities. Their romance is told through a Bollywood-inspired montage – in a full-throttle song that transcends into gospel, ending with a choir singing on Venice Beach.Being faithful to the novel’s idiosyncrasies is beside the point in this adaptation – don’t watch if you’re a stickler for accuracy, or if you don’t like characters seamlessly breaking into song. The film may lack nuanced depths, but it brims with joy. Austen’s novels are often restrained on the surface but bubbling with emotion underneath. In Bride & Prejudice, those emotions burst forth in larger-than-life numbers by Bollywood royalty Anu Malik.Primarily funded by the UK Film Council, this was a truly cross-cultural production – shot across LA, London and India with the three countries’ cast and crew creating something new together. Could a film like this be made today? I’m not so sure.What I am sure of is Bride & Prejudice honours Bollywood. The people are beautiful, the energy is infectious and any film that brings a cultural shake-up to a classic, predominantly white narrative should be welcomed. Maybe that’s the biggest message of all: finding commonality despite culture differences is infinitely more interesting. If that’s not feelgood, I don’t know what is.Bride and Prejudice is available to rent digitally in the US, UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsJane AustenMy feelgood movieMusicalsGurinder ChadhaRomance filmsComedy filmsBollywoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They will call for an increase in support from rich countries for Africa’s green resurgence, without which they will warn it could be fragile and spread unevenly.Richard Muyungi, the climate envoy and adviser to the president of Tanzania, said: “Africa is ready to be part of [the global fight to stave off climate breakdown] provided we are supported with finance, technology and capacity-building.View image in fullscreenA delegate at the summit. Africa is responsible for only 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions but bears the brunt of climate breakdown.Photograph: Luis Tato/AFP/Getty Images“There has been an increase of investments in some areas but Africa still needs a lot of financing to be able to be part of the global solution, and to address the challenges we are facing.”Green energy is booming in Africa, with 20 countries breaking records for imports of solar panels in the 12 months to June. According to the thinktank Ember, imports of photovoltaic equipment from Chinarose by 60% over the past year, from 9MW in 2024 to 15MW of capacity, with a tripling of imports to countries outside South Africa.Though the increase is impressive, it is from a low base. Africa, which boasts the greatest potential for solar power, haslagged far behind other countries in installations. Only 4% of global solar generation last year was in Africa, and in 2023, the International Energy Agency reported thatBelgium had as many solar panels as the entire continent.View image in fullscreenThe Redstone solar thermal power plant in Northern Cape, one of South Africa’s biggest renewable energy facilities.Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/Shutterstock“There is a glimmer of light [in the increased investment] but this is still quite meagre compared to other continents in the global south,” Muyungi said.Last year’s imported panels would add about 5% to current electricity generation capacity in 16 countries, according to Ember, but the need remains vast. About 600 million people in Africalack access to electricity, and about a billion have only firewood or dirty fuels for cooking. Women and girls areworst affected.Melaku Yirga, the regional director for Africa at Mercy Corps, a humanitarian organisation, said: “Renewable energy is not only Africa’s greatest opportunity, it is also an urgent necessity. Renewable power enables everything fromirrigation and food storageto early-warning systems, healthcare and livelihoods.”View image in fullscreenPeople reading by a makeshift fire at an informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesWhile recent increases in renewable energy investment were welcome, Yirga said the public sector and overseas aid were still vital.“Africa has no shortage of ambition in renewable energy, but without stronger international finance and the right incentives, the private sector will remain on the sidelines and adaptation goals will go unmet,” he said.“Private sector financing must be met with public commitments, and funding must also be long-term and reliable – short grants rarely achieve full impact, as meaningful engagement with governments and communities takes time and requires significant upfront investment.”Reductions in overseas aid from rich countries are causing consternation among African governments, many of which areblighted by record debt burdens, exacerbated by the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and recent interest rate rises.Macky Sall, the former president of Senegal, said: “The drop in official development assistance fundamentally changes the climate calculus. Where does that leave Africa, if we can no longer count on our partners’ promises?“The costs of the climate crisis have fallen most heavily on Africa. We are not the cause. We are not only footing the largest bill – we are also seeing the cheques to stem the damage cancelled.”View image in fullscreenA shepherd watches livestock near a solar thermal plant close to Upington, South Africa.Photograph: Themba Hadebe/APPrivate sector companieswill put cash into renewable energy, but few will help Africa adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis, which are already being felt in the form of droughts, floods and crop failures. Investment to build resilience – such as water storage systems, better infrastructure and new farming techniques – is lacking.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cobalt, lithium, copper, nickel, rare earths and other minerals are abundant in parts of Africa, which has spurred a global scramble for the resources.View image in fullscreenAn artisanal miner descends into a pit in Kolwezi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesHuman rights abuses have soared in some mining areas, with child labour and the exploitation of adult workers, particularly women, in places such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Africa’s under-resourced public sector is struggling to contain the damage and ensure resource extraction is done responsibly, without causing environmental devastation and in a way that benefits local people.Africa alsoabounds in gas, with reserves of the fossil fuel that have scarcely been tapped in some countries. Muyungi insisted they must be allowed to exploit those resources, despite the impact on the climate crisis. “We do not envisage anything to stop us using gas – we need it for our development,” he said.For rich countries to tackle the climate crisis, Africa’s assistance will be essential. If global north governments fail to address the continent’s needs, they will feel the impact. Roughly 60% of Africa’s population is under 25, a“youthquake” that could spur developmentor, if poorly handled, will be felt around the world.Abay Yimere, a scholar at the Climate Policy Lab at Tufts University in the US, said: “If the climate crisis is not tackled in Africa, that will be a problem for migration. If we do not provide them with jobs, and adapt to climate change, the impact will be huge and not controllable. The global north should look at this from their own national perspectives and see where their interest lies.”Explore more on these topicsRenewable energyAfricaGreen economyGreen jobsSolar powerEnergyEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The files contain a contract with Merlyn Advisors signed by Johnson months earlier in September 2023.The contract, drawn up by Merlyn, notes that Johnson “over a long career has acquired a unique experience and knowledge of domestic UK government politics and international relations”.It says Merlyn Advisors “interacts with a number of different domestic and international stakeholders which would benefit from the perspectives and the experiences of” Johnson. For each meeting, Johnson was to be paid a fee of £200,000 – worth up to £1.6m a year for eight meetings.The contract was to last two years from October 2023. The company would also pay £35,000 a month to support a thinktank that Johnson was considering setting up in the UK.Johnson did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Petermann said: “I have no comment. Please don’t try to put words in my mouth as to whether or not I dispute it.”The Guardian has not confirmed whether the payment made to Johnson was for his visit to Venezuela.The cache does not include a copy of the contract also signed by the company and it is possible it was abandoned after UK officials asked questions about the arrangement.However, a log of payments suggests that an invoice, which mirrors the contract, was sent by Johnson’s office to Petermann weeks after the meeting with Maduro, an authoritarian president whose government isunder investigationby international criminal court prosecutors for alleged crimes against humanity.View image in fullscreenNicolás Maduro during a press conference in Caracas this month.Photograph: Jesús Vargas/Getty ImagesThe invoice, for £200,000 plus an additional £40,000, was sent on 15 March 2024, weeks after the meeting with Maduro. This invoice was paid on 7 May, the document suggests. There are no details of other invoices to Merlyn.The files were obtained byDistributed Denial of Secrets, a US non-profit that archives data leaks. The Guardian is the first media outlet to publish stories based on the leak.Johnson has said he was “extensively briefed” by the top UK diplomat in Caracas before the meeting and updated the embassy afterwards.However, the £240,000 payment raises questions about the true nature of the trip and Johnson’s claims to have acted as a diplomatic backchannel for the UK to open a dialogue with Maduro.The Sunday Timeshas reported that Johnson did not tell Cameron about Petermann’s involvement in the meeting.Cameron, who was embroiled in his own post-Downing Street scandal, might have warned Johnson of the perils of using the privileges of his role as a former PM for financial gain. As prime minister, Johnson had launched an official investigation into Cameron’s lobbying for Greensill Capital.Questions about candourJohnson faced questions from UK government officials about the Venezuela meeting after a series of reports in early March last year from the Sunday Times and the Financial Times revealing Petermann’s involvement and Johnson’s relationship with the company. But details of the contract and an invoice sent to the company have not previously been reported.The media reports drew the attention of officials at the Whitehall revolving-door watchdog responsible for monitoring the post-government careers of ex-ministers, the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba).They wrote to Johnson on 18 March 2024. What seemed confusing to the officials was that Johnson had made an application months earlier, in September 2023. What they had not known – and what is revealed in the leaked files – is that the contract prepared by the hedge fund had been signed by Johnson.At the time, Johnson faced a potential difficulty: he had told Acoba that “no publicity or announcement whatsoever is planned in relation to this role”, but if approval was given by Acoba, his work for the hedge fund would be revealed to the public in a letter published by the watchdog.Johnson now faces fresh questions about his candour with the watchdog. He told Acoba he had had no meetings with the hedge fund in his last two years in office.View image in fullscreenMaarten Petermann.Photograph: L’ÉquipeIn fact, Johnson had a meeting with Petermann when he was still in office, just over a week before the end of his time as prime minister, leaked documents show.The leaked files reveal they met for a two-and-a-half-hour lunch at Chequers, Johnson’s grace-and-favour country house, on 28 August 2022. Petermann attended alongside a fellow trustee at an animal conservation charity that had hired Johnson’s soon-to-be wife, Carrie, more than a year earlier in January 2021.The lunch with Petermann has not been previously reported and was never disclosed in official transparency registers. The secret lunch raises questions over whether Johnson used his final days as prime minister, and the luxuries of that office, to develop a relationship with a future business interest.Fourteen months after the Chequers lunch, Johnson told Acoba officials in October 2023 that he had decided not to take up a role with the hedge fund. This came only days after he had signed the contract prepared by Merlyn Advisors. One possibility is that the contract was shelved at the 11th hour after Acoba’s inquiries.For a fortnight in late March 2024, Acoba repeatedly sought clarification from Johnson about his role with the company. He repeatedly denied having a contractual relationship with the company or having been paid for any meetings in Venezuela. He refused to say in what capacity he had met Maduro, or to characterise his relationship with the company.The then chair of Acoba, the Conservative peer Eric Pickles, would later characterise Johnson’s responses as “evasive” and lacking candour. Lord Pickles concluded there remained “a reasonable concern” Johnson was acting for the company in “a capacity that would be considered advisory work” and had breached the rules by failing to properly answer Acoba’s questions.Just over a fortnight later, the £240,000 invoice would be marked by Johnson’s staff as paid.Quick GuideContact Henry Dyer about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Henry using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The course is not only confirmed: we will accelerate and deepen it even further.”In Sunday’s elections, only seats in Buenos Aires province were at stake – not including the capital of the same name. It had held its elections in May, which were won by the president’s party.Milei has slashed public spending, dismissed tens of thousands of public employees and led a major deregulation drive since taking office in December 2023. But in recent months, things have begun to go wrong for him.“The economy has not advanced sufficiently, inflation has not been brought down in any significant way, and wages have been practically frozen,” said Tokatlian, a professor of international relations at the Universidad Torcuato Di Tella in Buenos Aires.The government faced a cryptocurrency debacle after the president promoted an obscure token called $Libra, which soared in value following his endorsement before collapsing dramatically, prompting dozens of criminal complaints alleging fraud.Milei also vetoed bills that would have increased pensions and disability benefits, but last week, the national congress took a step not seen in more than 20 years and overturned the president’s veto.Signs of Milei’s growing unpopularity were already evident when, nearly two weeks ago, he waspelted with stonesby demonstrators while campaigning for Sunday’s election.Alejandro Daniel Pons, 57, an architect from Mar del Plata, voted for Milei in the 2023 presidential election but chose not to vote on Sunday because he did not want to back either the president’s party or the opposition.“[Milei] should keep governing because he does know about economics, but he went too far in squeezing ordinary people. That mistake has now come back to haunt him at the polls,” Pons said.Turnout was nearly 65% – about 10% lower than in the previous local polls. According to Tokatlian, those who stayed away were precisely the voters who, in 2023, had backed Milei over Peronism – the name given to Argentina’s main leftwing movement, in reference to former president Gen Juan Domingo Perón and his wife, Eva.“This time the anger is with the government,” he said.University student Valentina Villagra, 27, who lives in the district of Hurlingham, said that finding work has become extremely difficult, and the jobs that do exist offer very low wages.“Faced with a government that is determined to purchase power and wipe out all the human and social rights we have built … the only possible response was Peronism,” she said.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaJavier MileiAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Police returned fire, killing the shooter, who they believe to be Phillips, pending formal identification.Hours later, authorities located Phillips’s children, two of whom were believed to be in the wilderness, amid concerns they would be alone in temperatures that were forecast to reach freezing overnight.Police deputy commissioner Jill Rogers said they were found at a local campsite, adding: “I can confirm that the children are well and uninjured, and they will be taken to a location this evening for medical checks.”Earlier, Rogers said: “This has been a deeply traumatic incident this morning for those involved.

Police officers laid spikes at an intersection, which the quad bike ran over, she said. The quad bike came to a halt, which is when police came under fire, with one officer sustaining critical but survivable injuries.“Our officer has been struck in the head … soon after a second patrol unit arrived and engaged the offender,” she said, adding the offender was given immediate first aid but died at the scene. “The formal identification of this male is yet to take place, but we believe him to be Tom Phillips.”1:27Two children still missing after police shooting of NZ fugitive Tom Phillips, police say – videoRogers said one of his children was located at the scene, as well as multiple firearms. “The child located at the scene is being provided wrap around support, and we will not be providing any other comment at this time on their location.”Specialist teams, including about 50 staff and the armed offenders squad, were out in force to locate the other two children, Rogers said on Monday afternoon, noting there were about three hours of daylight left.“It will be down to freezing point, I would imagine, this evening,” the acting deputy commissioner said. “Hence we want this incident resolved as soon as possible.”map of piopioThe police constable who suffered critical injuries is undergoing the first of many surgeries at hospital.Cat expressed her concern for the police officer who was injured in the incident and to the community that had been affected. “Your compassion has sustained us,” she said.The family would be working with government agencies to support the safe return and reconnection of the children, she said. “They have endured a long and difficult journey, and we ask for privacy as we help them adjust and reintegrate into a stable and loving environment.”The mayor of Waitomo, John Robertson, told the Guardian it was the worst possible outcome for the community.“I’m shattered, to be honest and there will be many in the community that are devastated that this was the outcome after three and a half, four years,” he said.Robertson said the community was deeply concerned for the welfare of the children and he had hoped that the situation would have been resolved through negotiations with Phillips.Phillips’ family and the family of the policeman would be deeply affected, he said.“It’s just devastating news. Really the worst outcome we could have expected.”The vast Waikato region,where Phillips was presumed hiding, is made up of long sweeping coastline to the west, forested terrain and farmland in the centre, limestone cave networks to the north and a smattering of small rural towns and settlements throughout.Phillips came from a farming family in Marokopa – a tiny coastal settlement of less than 100 people that became inextricably linked with Phillips’s story.The remoteness of the landscape frustrated police attempts to locate Phillips.The case has fascinated New Zealanders, who have struggled to understand how, in a country of close-knit communities, Phillips could have evaded detection. While there was no suggestion his family helped Phillips, the question of how he managed to conceal himself and his three children – and survive – in the harsh terrain puzzled the nation, leading to speculation others in the community may have aided him.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Thanks for reading.New Zealand fugitive father Tom Phillips has been shot dead by policeinvestigating an armed burglary, police say. He had been hiding in wilderness with his three children – now aged nine, 10 and 12 – for nearly four years following a custody dispute with their mother.Police were alerted to the burglary about 2.30am on Monday and pursued two suspects on a quad bike before coming under firefrom one of them from a high-powered rifle, authorities said. Police returned fire, killing the shooter, who they believe to be Phillips, pending formal identification.A police officer sustained critical but survivable injuriesand was undergoing the first of many surgeries at hospital, police said.One of Phillips’ children was located at the scene, as well as multiple firearms, said police deputy commissioner Jill Rogers. The child was being given “wrap-around support” and was reportedly cooperating with police.Hours later, authorities located Phillips’s children, two of whom were believed to be in the wilderness, amid concerns they would be alone in temperatures that were forecast to reach freezing overnight. Rogers said they were found at a local campsite, adding: “I can confirm that the children are well and uninjured, and they will be taken to a location this evening for medical checks.”Vehicles drive through a roadblock from the scene of the fatal shooting near the town of Piopio, New Zealand, on Monday.Photograph: Dj Mills/AFP/Getty ImagesPrime minister Christopher Luxon said the morning’s events were “sad and absolutely tragic”and “this is not what anybody wanted to happen today”.

For the second time in less than a year, the LDP was stripped of its majority – this time inupper house electionsheld in July.In dealing a double whammy to Ishida’s fledgling government, voters made it clear that his party still had much to do to address the funding scandal – in which dozens of LDP lawmakers were found to have siphoned unreported profits from the sale of tickets to party gatherings into slush funds.Ishiba’s predecessor, Fumio Kishida, apologised in February last year for “inviting suspicion and mistrust” in politics in the wake of the scandal, and promised to stop holding fundraising parties during his time as prime minister. But there has been no concerted show of contrition; Ishiba himself was forced to issue an apology after he gave gift certificates, paid for with his own money, to 15 newly elected LDP members of the lower house – a gesture his critics said was proof of a prevailing culture of monetary rewards in the party.As the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper put it in an editorial days before the upper house poll, lawmakers had “underestimated” the strength of public anger over money in politics.Ishiba claimed to have made “considerable progress” in addressing the scandal with the abolition of “policy activity expenses,” which do not have to be disclosed, but he and other LDP lawmakers opposed bans on corporate and group donations to party branches.The fact that most of the dozens of politicians and their aides involved in the scandal were never indicted only added to the anger felt by many voters. “There is no sign of self-reflection on the significant loss of trust in politics,” the Mainichi said.And so on Sunday, the same scandal that hadfelled his predecessor, Kishida, also brought Ishiba’s premiership to an abrupt end.The LDP has been here before, however – and recovered.In the mid-1990s it reached an improbable accommodation with the socialists, whose leader, Tomiichi Murayama, was installed as prime minister in return for their participation in a three-party coalition. In 2009, the LDP waspunisheda second time following a slew of scandals that saw it relinquish power to the opposition for the first time since the war.As it braces for a leadership election in early October, the LDP on Monday began its search for a successor with the ability to repeat those feats of resurrection.“Having watched the party’s fault lines widen over the past year … party leaders may look for a leader who can promote unity, generate public excitement and support, and work with one or more opposition parties to stabilise the government,” said Tobias Harris, founder of the political risk advisory firmJapanForesight.The focus on turning around the party’s fortunes could drown out debate on economic and foreign policy, despite concern over rising regional tensions, Trump’s trade war and thecost of living crisis.They “may be less significant as the LDP grapples with an existential crisis that may well still result in the party going into opposition for the third time in its history,” Harris added.Last autumn, after Ishiba presided over the LDP’s chastening lower house election results barely a month into his prime ministership, he conceded that voters had issued a “severe judgment” on his party – a phrase he repeated after July’s upper house debacle.But unless the party’s warring factions can quickly regroup – possibly by coalescing around the youthful and media-friendly frontrunnerShinjiro Koizumi– the harshest verdict may be yet to come.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

They will apply to app stores, interactive games, chatbots, pornography websites, generative AI tools and software manufacturers and suppliers.Any service that hosts or facilitates access to content such as pornography, self-harm material, simulated gaming, or very violent material unsuitable for children will need to ensure children are not able to access that content.“We know there has been a recent proliferation of these apps online and that many of them are free, accessible to children, and advertised on mainstream services, so it’s important these codes include measures to protect children from them,” Inman Grant said in a statement.“I do not want Australian children and young people serving as casualties of powerful technologies thrust on to the market without guardrails and without regard for their safety and wellbeing.”These new measures add to earlier codes that require search engines to have age assurance measures for all accounts, and where an account holder is determined to be aged under 18, the search engine would be required to switch on safe search features to filter out content such as pornography from search results.One of the industry bodies that worked with the eSafety commissioner to develop the codes, Digi, said they would “introduce targeted and proportionate safeguards concerning access to pornography and material rated as unsuitable for minors under 18, such as very violent materials or those advocating or [giving instructions for] suicide, eating disorders or self-harm”.Companies that do not comply with the codes face a fine similar to that of the social media ban – up to $49.5m for a breach. Other measures such as eSafety requesting sites be delisted from search results are also an option for non-compliance.In Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

Ley faces the difficult task of rebuilding trust with the Indian communityGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastMon 8 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTShareSussan Ley had three options to deal withJacinta Nampijinpa Pricewhen the Liberal leader was putting together her first frontbench in late May.All carried risks.The first was to keep Price in the shadow cabinet, which might have curtailed her policy freelancing but also risked alienating Liberal colleagues who considered her undeserving of such a role so soon after defecting from the Nationals.The second was to relegate her to the backbench, which might have appeased those same Liberals but risked raising the ire of Price, party members and conservative commentators who passionately support her.The final option was to shift Price to an off-Broadway portfolio in the outer shadow ministry in the hope she would keep her head down, and out of trouble.Ley picked the third and hoped for – but perhaps never expected – the best.Within hours of doing so, Price was on Sky News – seemingly her preferred media megaphone – criticising the leader’s decision and claiming some of the frontbench appointments were not based on merit.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWith that swift and pointed public rebuke, the Northern Territory senator made clear that she wouldn’t shy away from the outspokenness that defined her brand of combative rightwing politics.Those qualities made Price a rare commodity – a conservative political superstar – during the voice to parliament referendum.It also made her an ever-present danger for Ley as the opposition leader attempted to guide the Liberals back to the political middle ground following the last federal election disaster.So it has proven three months later.In one interview last week, conducted just as theLiberals were celebrating a rare political winon aged care, Price demonstrated just how damaging and distracting she could be.The senator’ssuggestion that the Albanese government’s migration program favoured some countries over others to win votes – with specific reference to the Indian community – threatens to inflict far more political damage to the Coalition than, for example, her ill-timed “Make Australia Great Again” rally cry during the May election.View image in fullscreenLey and other senior Liberals quickly denounced Price’s statement and sought to patch up ties with the Indian community – including with a walk-through in Sydney’s Harris Park, known as ‘Little India’.Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAPThe senator’s initial comments to the ABC were not only factually incorrect (Australia has a non-discriminatory migration program) but deeply hurtful to a large and growing diaspora community that the Liberals cannot afford to alienate if it wants to return to power.She walked back the remarks within hours, acknowledging the “longstanding and bipartisan non-discriminatory migration policy” and saying “Suggestions otherwise are a mistake”, adding that she had “sought to highlight issues of uncontrolled mass migration and ruptures to social cohesion”.But the claims about Indian migrants were not made in a vacuum. They were delivered in the aftermath of nationwide anti-immigration rallies, which organisers promoted, in part, with similarly targeted claims about the same community.The speed with which Ley and other senior Liberals denounced Price’s statement and sought to patch up ties with the Indian community – including with a walk-through in Sydney’s Harris Park, known as “Little India”, and a roundtable on Monday – demonstrates how alive they are to these potential long-term repercussions.Ley must also now contain the internal fallout, which has quickly spread from anger and dismay at Price’s original comments to other factional and personal tensions lingering within her partyroom.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But she has not explicitly apologised for them, instead since pointing the finger at unspecified “agenda-driven” media reporting that “wrenched” her comments out of context.On Thursday she was more specific, however. “It was the ABC interviewer who pushed the issue, who brought up the issue of anti-Indian migration,” she said.She also launched an extraordinary public attack on herLiberal colleague Alex Hawke, accusing him of berating one of her staff members after he called about the remarks – allegations that Hawke denies.Hawke – a polarising figure internally – is one of Ley’s closest allies and did the numbers for her successful leadership race against Angus Taylor, who recruited Price to run as his deputy. The factional subplot to this unfolding saga is not lost on aghast Liberals watching this all play out.Then there’s Jane Hume.The dumped frontbencher was dragged into the saga after being outed as the unnamed female Coalition politician who Hawke allegedly suggested Price could suffer a similar fate to, if she didn’t apologise.Hume’s comment about“Chinese spies”during the election campaign was blamed for a collapse in the Liberal vote in seats with large Chinese communities.“I’m still reeling a little bit … I’m not entirely sure what this is all about and why my name needs to be included,” Hume told Sky News.Hawke – in two separate media interviews on Monday – denied Hume’s dumping was raised during a phone call with Price.Price had the final word on Monday, appearing (again) on Sky News to explain her version of events. She expressed regret that she wasn’t “clearer” in initial comments.As for an apology to Indian-Australians? Not quite.“I have asked our leader if she would ask Alex Hawke to apologise to me for his conduct. I’m a Liberal women and Liberal women need to be able to feel like they’re being supported,” Price said.Ley faces a long and difficult task to rebuild trust with the Indian community.Managing Price, and the ongoing risk of another outburst and the political damage it could inflict, might prove just as hard.Explore more on these topicsJacinta Nampijinpa PriceSussan LeyAustralian politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

They’ve been important pieces of keeping the community safe for a long period of time,” Chris Minns said.“In relation to the right to hunt, on reflection, I’ve had a look at it, and I think that that shouldn’t be in the legislation,” he said.Minns had initially supported the controversial bill which would have allowed recreational hunters to shoot feral animals on public lands like state forests and crown lands.But theConservation Hunting bill has drawn widespread criticismfrom environmental groups, scientists, the gun control lobby and the architect of Australia’s tough gun control measures, the former prime minister John Howard.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailEnvironmentalists say recreational shooting of feral animals like pigs and deer is not as effective as professionally managed programs.Gun controladvocates have argued that elements of the bill, particularly the right to hunt, were a slippery slide to liberalisation of guns.Minns appears to have been persuaded to oppose one element of the bill though Labor may still support the bill with changes.“You’re allowed to hunt in NSW, but whether you have a right to hunt, akin to a right to freedom of speech or a right to vote, I think they’re vastly different things,” Minns said.Minns said he was also concerned that the right could evoke the idea of a right to bear arms, as exists in the US.“We can never go down that road. There can’t be a right to bear arms in a country like Australia. We’ve seen that in other jurisdictions, in other places around the world, be a complete disaster. I don’t want that here in Australia,” he said.A parliamentary committee is due to report on the bill on Friday, with the bill set to come before NSW parliament next week.The Greens MP and spokesperson for the environment, Sue Higginson, said: “The premier’s decision to abandon the ‘right to hunt’ clause is a win for the community and for effective control of invasive species, but this bill is still a vehicle for the gun lobby.”In the bill, the new Conservation Hunting Authority will replace the Game and Pest Management Advisory Board, which provides advice on pest management.“The standalone, government-funded promotional platform for gun lobby that’s proposed in this law will exclude conservation experts, stack decision-making roles with gun advocates, and be required to promote hunting no matter the evidence,” Higginson said.The body will cost $7.9m over the next two years.Groups like the Alana and Madeline Foundation, set up by Walter Mikac after his wife and two young daughters were killed in the 1996 Port Arthur shooting, have also raised concerns.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Minns had already indicated he would seek to change these provisions.The shadow cabinet was meeting to discuss its position on Monday afternoon.Sources who were aware of the outcome of the meeting said the Liberals agreed to oppose the bill outright but the Nationals were still considering their position and were likely to support it with amendments.The Greens have vowed to continue fighting the legislation.“Chris Minns wants the people of NSW to believe that this is about conservation and it’s just not – this is about politics.

A minimum of 85 seats are needed for a majority.Just two hours later, with 99% of the vote counted, the result had held, according to state broadcaster NRK.Labour, led by the prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, had clearly emerged as the largest party, but there was also a big swell in support for the rightwing Progress party, which was projected to have doubled in size in the last four years.The Conservative party, meanwhile, had its worst election in 20 years.Støre welcomed the results, playing down any shift to the right. “This is a signal to outsideNorwaythat social democracy can also win despite a right-wing wave,” he told a jubilant crowd of Labour supporters chanting “four more years“.The election was unusually close-fought and polarised, dominated by the cost of living, wealth taxes, oil fund investment in Israel and relations withDonald Trump.On the right, there was a surge in support for the populist Progress party – especially among young men – in what has been described by some as “the Maga-fication” of Norwegian politics.There was also discussion over its leader, Sylvi Listhaug, becoming prime minister in the event of a rightwing victory.But results suggest that Støre, 65, who has been prime minister since 2021, is likely to remain in office, with the former Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg, thought to have provided a significant boost for Labour in recent months, as finance minister.This was despite a campaign that was kicked off by strong criticism over the government’s handling of the Norwegian oil fund’s investment in Israel, which could contribute to complex negotiations with smaller leftwing parties to form a government.Gaute Børstad Skjervø, leader of the AUF, Labour’s youth party, said it was “the comeback of the ages in Norwegian politics”, adding that a year ago the party was “doomed”.“Now Støre has secured re-election. I take my hat off to this turnaround,” he said.The Conservative party leader, Erna Solberg, confirmed their defeat, telling her supporters in Oslo: “We can already state that the Conservative party is embarking on a new term in the Storting as an opposition party.”Solberg, 64, who was already facing calls to resign, said: “It is my responsibility, and I am incredibly sorry for that.”Listhaug, 47, reportedly called Støre to congratulate him on his victory.“It’s fantastic. We’re doing better than what the polls showed. So it’s incredibly good,” she said. Despite not having secured a majority, she said: “We still have reason to feel like winners today.”A record 1.9 million people took part in early voting. By the time polls closed, most of the early votes were reportedly already counted.Despite the rise in support for the Progress party, a centre-left victory leaves Norway an outlier from its Nordic neighbours, Sweden and Finland, which are both led by rightwing governments.Explore more on these topicsNorwayEuropeDonald TrumpThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

His office said he would make the decision “in the coming days”.Bayrou was toppled when 364 deputies voted that they had no confidence in the government. Just 194 gave him their confidence. Bayrou had called thevotehimself as a last-ditch gamble for support, saying he needed backing from parliament for austerity measures to reduce the public debt.In a speech to parliament before the vote, Bayrou had saidFrancewas under threat from its “inexorable swamp of debt” and must find a “compromise” on a budget. He said if some “minimal” understanding and consensus was not found in the divided parliament then “government action will be destined to fail”.When the leaders of opposition party groups, from the left to the far right, made fiercely critical speeches against him, he said: “I won’t respond to insults” and warned that the image of verbal “violence and contempt” among politicians was damaging democracy.Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally’s parliamentary group told MPs that Bayrou’s departure was “the end of the agony of a phantom government”.Le Pen, who was found guilty in March of theembezzlement of European parliamentary fundsthrough a fake jobs scam and banned from running for office for five years, said Macron must call a parliamentary election immediately, even if it meant she could not run again for her seat in northern France. She has appealed against her conviction and an appeal trial will begin in January.Macron, who stunned the political world by calling asnap parliament electionlast year which resulted in a chamber divided into three blocs – left, centre and far right – has expressed reluctance to call another vote. The far right leads the polls and a new election could result in a similar hung parliament.French deputies – Bayrou confidence motion votePoliticians on the left, which won the most seats in last year’s election, but fell well short of an absolute majority, have said Macron should appoint a prime minister from their camp.During Monday’s debate, Boris Vallaud called Macron “a defeated president” who he held responsible for “impoverishing the poor, enriching the rich and turning his back on the future”.The Socialist MP said Bayrou’s decision to call the vote was not “an act of courage, but a cop-out”.Mathilde Panot of La France Insoumise, a leftwing party, said Bayrou had been “severely beaten”. She added: “He wanted his hour of truth; he got it.”Panot said that as just a third of parliament had given its confidence to Bayrou, Macron’s economic policies had a minority of support and he should also resign. The president, whose term ends in 2027, has always ruled out stepping down.As head of state with authority on foreign policy and national security, Macron directly appoints a prime minister to run domestic affairs. But since last year’s election there has been no absolute majority in the national assembly, creating a form of political deadlock and disagreement on the budget. This means there is no certainty that a new prime minister would be safe from being ousted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Public sector strikes are to follow.The priority for Macron is to appoint a prime minister able to push through a budget for 2026.Bayrou’s unpopular plan for a €44bn (£38bn) budget squeeze and austerity programme to reduce France’s public debt is now certain to be shelved, including his contested proposal to scrap two public holidays. Any new government will return to the drawing board.Bayrou is the second PM to fall since the snap election in June last year – the rightwingMichel Barnier was oustedafter just three months in December. Bayrou had become the most unpopular French prime minister since 1958, largely over his unpopular budget but also his perceived lack of government action.His popularity had also been dented by his stance on anabuse scandal at the Bétharram private Catholic schoolnear his home in south-west France.Bayrou sent several of his children to the school, where his wife also taught catechism. Aparliamentary reportin July found Bayrou failed to act to prevent physical and sexual abuse at the school when he served as education minister between 1993 and 1997.Bayrou was questioned by a parliamentary inquiry about whether he knew about abuse at Bétharram and covered it up. He said he had “hidden nothing”, saying his foes were leading a political campaign of “destruction” against him.His criticisms of the parliamentary inquiry cost him support on Monday night even among his own centrists.The northern politician Violette Spillebout, who co-chaired the parliamentary inquiry, said that despite being a fellow centrist, she abstained in the confidence vote out of anger at Bayrou’s comments on TV this weekend that the parliamentary inquiry was a “political tribune”. She said his comments were an “insult to victims”.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He was raised in Auchterarder, Perthshire. He moved to Holyhead in 1980 where he had a long career as a customs officer.“A lifelong transport enthusiast, in retirement he enjoyed visiting heritage railways and tramways around the world. It is a comfort to his sons, their mother, and his brothers that his final moments were in pursuit of the hobby which gave him so much happiness.”Theother British victims have been named asthe theatre director Kayleigh Smith, 36, and her partner Will Nelson, 44, a lecturer at Manchester’s Arden School of Theatre.Also among the dead were five Portuguese nationals, two Canadians, two South Koreans, one American, one French, one Swiss and one Ukrainian.Portugal’s Office for Air and Rail Accident Investigations on Saturday released itsfirst investigative reportinto the crash, which said the cabins had travelled “not more than about six metres” when they “suddenly lost the balancing force provided by the cable connecting them”.The report said an examination of the wreckage showed “the connecting cable had given way” at the attachment point to the cabin at the top of the hill.A preliminary and final report are expected to be published later.Lisbon’s city council has tasked a team of experts with designing a new mechanism to ensure the safety of the Glória funicular railway, a city official said on Monday.“We must guarantee maximum security,” the council’s vice-president, Filipe Anacoreta Correia, said, adding that the country needed to be reassured over safety before the cable car could reopen.The group will include technicians from the municipal public transport company Carris, which operates the funicular, and experts from universities, Portugal’s engineering regulatory organisation, and national civil engineering laboratory LNEC, Correia added.During an extraordinary meeting, the council also voted to give the expert team the final say on when it was safe to resume the funicular’s operation.Additional reporting by ReutersExplore more on these topicsPortugalWalesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

What might happen now?Read moreA European Commission spokesperson also confirmed that its president, Ursula von der Leyen, spoke to the US vice-president, JD Vance, over the phone on Friday, and “the only topic during the call was Ukraine”.Asked by a reporter at the White House on Sunday if he was ready to move to “the second phase” of sanctions againstRussia, Trump responded: “Yeah I am,”without elaborating.Trump also said that “certain European leaders are coming over to our country on Monday or Tuesday individually” and that he would speak to the Russian president soon.Trump has previously threatened tougher measures against Putin, but each time has allowed deadlines to pass without action.Speaking in Helsinki on Monday, Costa said the EU and US were “coordinating our efforts to align our sanctions, to be more effective” and to increase pressure on Putin to join peace negotiations with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.He said the EU needed to increase sanctions on Russia, “but also secondary sanctions” on countries buying gas and oil from Russia.A bar graph showing the number of daily missile and drone strikes in UkraineThe German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, condemned Russia’s attacks on Ukraine, “which show further escalation”, a German government spokesperson said on Monday. The spokesperson also said Germany would welcome the US joining Europe in pushing for more sanctions against Russia.In a coordinated move, France and Germany have proposed further sanctions targeting Russia’s energy revenues, including listing non-sanctioned oil majors, such as privately owned Lukoil, as well as going after refineries in foreign countries that re-export Russian oil to the EU. The EU’s two key players also propose increasing pressure on Russia’s civilian economy, via measures targeting civil aviation and engineering. “Russia continues its stalling tactics and persists in refusing a ceasefire,” said a Franco-German paper that calls for increased pressure.Over the weekend, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, suggested the US and EU could impose tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil. Bessent said the US was preparing to increase pressure on Russia and urged Europe to do more: “We need our European partners to follow us, because if the US and EU can do this together … we are in a race now between how long the Ukrainian military hold up versus how long can the Russian economy hold up.”The Trump administration has imposed50% tariffs on goods from Indiain response to its purchases of discounted Russian oil, but declined to take such punitive action against other large buyers of Russian energy, such as China.The issue of secondary sanctions, which would apply penalties to third countries that trade with Russia, could be difficult for the EU, which is racing to sign new trade deals, including with India, by the end of the year to counter Trump’s tariffs that are roiling international relations.The US focus on Russian energy also puts an uncomfortable spotlight on Hungary and Slovakia. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, and the Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, favour Trump’s agenda but are also friendly to Putin and haveopposed EU plans to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2028.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The EU has pledged to buy $750bn of US oil, gas and nuclear products by 2028.The EU has approved 18 rounds of sanctions against Russia since the full-scale invasion of February 2022, with further proposals expected in the coming days.The last set of EU sanctions, agreed in July, lowered the price cap on Russian oil, closed loopholes to reduce trade in Russian petroleum products and banned vessels carrying Russian energy from European ports.Speaking alongside Costa, Finland’s prime minister, Petteri Orpo, said cooperation with the US on sanctions was crucial. The latest attacks on Ukraine showed, he said, “that Putin will not stop killing, he will not go to the negotiation tables. That is why we have to cooperate with and negotiate with the US to find a way to do more sanctions, stronger sanctions, do more military support to Ukraine, and build security arrangements to Ukraine.”View image in fullscreenThe European Council president, Antonio Costa (left), and the Finnish prime minister, Petteri Orpo, during their joint press conference on Monday.Photograph: Roni Rekomaa/APOn Sunday Russia launched itslargest-ever barrage on Ukraine, setting the main government building in Kyiv on fire, and killing at least four people, including a woman and her baby.Zelenskyy said Putin was testing the world to see “whether they will accept or tolerate this” and he urged Ukraine’s allies to impose more sanctions and “tough tariffs” on Russia.The Kremlin said on Monday that no sanctions would ever force Russia to change course on Ukraine.Europe and Ukraine are doing everything they can to draw the US into their orbit, said the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyEuropean UnionEuropeInternational tradeEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The pledge had 1,200 signers as of Sunday night.The pledge, shared exclusively with the Guardian,claims to draw inspiration from the cultural boycott that contributed to the end of apartheid in South Africa.It commits signatories not to screen films, appear at or otherwise work with what it considers complicit institutions – including festivals, cinemas, broadcasters and production companies. Examples of complicity include “whitewashing or justifying genocide and apartheid, and/or partnering with the government committing them”.“We answer the call of Palestinian film-makers, who haveurgedthe international film industry to refuse silence, racism, and dehumanisation, as well as to ‘do everything humanly possible’ to end complicity in their oppression,” the statement reads.View image in fullscreenAyo Edebiri is one of the signatories.Photograph: Alessandra Benedetti/Corbis/Getty ImagesThe pledge was published by the group Film Workers for Palestine.Screenwriter David Farr, who is among the signatories, said in a statement: “As the descendant of Holocaust survivors, I am distressed and enraged by the actions of the Israeli state, which has for decades enforced an apartheid system on the Palestinian people whose land they have taken, and which is now perpetuating genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza.“In this context I cannot support my work being published or performed in Israel. The cultural boycott was significant in South Africa. It will be significant this time and in my view should be supported by all artists of conscience.”AnFAQaccompanying the pledge addresses how to determine which film entities are implicated, and states: “Israel’s major film festivals (including but not limited to Jerusalem film festival, Haifa international film festival, Docaviv and TLVFest) continue to partner with the Israeli government while it carries outwhat leading experts have defined as genocideagainst Palestinians in Gaza.“The vast majority of Israeli film production and distribution companies, sales agents, cinemas and other film institutions have never endorsed the full, internationally recognised rights of the Palestinian people,” it adds.The pledge notes that there are “a few Israeli film entities that are not complicit” and advises following “guidelines set by Palestinian civil society”.The film industry workers also clarify in the FAQ that the pledge does not prohibit them from working with Israeli individuals.“The call is for film workers to refuse to work with Israeli institutions that are complicit in Israel’s human rights abuses against the Palestinian people,” the statement reads. “This refusal takes aim at institutional complicity, not identity. There are also 2 million Palestinians with Israeli citizenship, and Palestinian civil society has developed context sensitive guidelines for that community.”The pledge does not explicitly mention the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which is the most prominent civil society effort identifying what it considers complicity with Israel. But it is one of the most prominent cultural boycott efforts announced against Israel since the assault on Gaza started, coming nearly one year aftermore than 1,000 writersannounced a similar pledge.View image in fullscreenYorgos Lanthimos.Photograph: Mickael Chavet/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe effort invokes Filmmakers United Against Apartheid, an initiative founded in 1987 by Jonathan Demme, Martin Scorsese and other prominent film-makers whorefusedto screen their films inapartheid-eraSouth Africa.In a statement responding to the pledge, the Israeli Producers Association said that “the signatories of this petition are targeting the wrong people”.“For decades, we Israeli artists, storytellers, and creators have been the primary voices allowing audiences to hear and witness the complexity of the conflict, including Palestinian narratives and criticism of Israeli state policies. We work with Palestinian creators, telling our shared stories and promoting peace and an end to violence through thousands of films, TV series, and documentaries,” they wrote in a statement sent to the Guardian.“This call for boycott is profoundly misguided. By targeting us – the creators who give voice to diverse narratives and foster dialogue – these signatories are undermining their own cause and attempting to silence us. This shortsighted act seeks to eliminate precisely the collaborative efforts working toward ending violence and achieving peace. We will not allow this and will push back in our efforts to end violence and bring just peace to our region for the benefit of all,” they added.The newcampaign comes amid a growing number of entertainment industry initiatives to protest Israel’s war in Gaza. Earlier this summer, hundreds of actors and film-makers – including Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal, Ralph Fiennes and director Guillermo del Toro –signed an open lettercondemning what they described as the film industry’s silence over Israel’s deadly military campaign in Gaza.Activists hope to shift Venice film festival focus on to crisis in GazaRead moreMany of the same figures who have signed the new pledge were alsoamong the hundredsof Screen Actors Guild members who, last year, urged union leadership to protect members from being blacklisted over their views on Palestine. More recently, the Norwegian Actors’ Equity Association recommended its members refuse to work with certain Israeli cultural institutions.Last summer,Variety reportedthat more than 65 Palestinian film-makers also signed a letter in which they accused Hollywood of “dehumanising” Palestinians on screen over decades.In that letter, the film-makerscalled ontheir international colleagues “to stand against working with production companies that are deeply complicit in dehumanising Palestinians, or whitewashing and justifying Israel’s crimes against us”.Last week,The Voice of Hind Rajab, a new film about a five-year-old girl killed by Israeli forces in Gaza last year, received a 23-minute standing ovationafter its premiereat theVenice film festival. Brad Pitt, Jonathan Glazer, Phoenix, Rooney Mara and Alfonso Cuarón were among the executive producers on the film.Explore more on these topicsFilmIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Twenty-six others suffered injuries, including six who were left in a serious condition with gunshot wounds.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, visited the site of the attack in Jerusalem with his far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir. “The war continues, in Jerusalem as well,” Netanyahu said.He later repeated calls for people in Gaza City to leave before an upcoming “ground operation” by Israeli forces. “You have been warned – get out of there,” he said.0:45Netanyahu tells Gaza City residents to leave as Israeli forces prepare for ground manoeuvre – videoIsrael Katz, Israel’s defence minister, later posted on X that Gaza would face “a mighty hurricane” if Hamas did not release the last hostages it was holding.The finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said: “This abominable attack will have the most severe and far-reaching consequences.“We will pursue terror everywhere. Just as we crushed Palestinian terror in the Jenin terror camp and the terror camps in northern Samaria – so we will soon do in additional terror camps. Whoever sponsors terror and directs terror will pay the full price.”After the attack, the Israeli military said it was encircling Palestinian villages on the outskirts of the nearby West Bank city of Ramallah.Eyal Zamir, the Israel Defense Forces’ chief of staff, later said in a statement that he “ordered a full closure of the area from which the terrorists came”.“We will continue with a determined and ongoing operational and intelligence effort, we will pursue terror cells everywhere, and we will thwart terrorist infrastructure and its organisers,” he said.A local map showing the location of the deadly bus stop shootingMahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, issued a statement condemning “any targeting of Palestinian and Israeli civilians”.Hamas praised two Palestinian “resistance fighters” who it said had carried out the attack, but stopped short of claiming responsibility. Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant group, also praised the shooting without claiming responsibility.The war in Gaza has sparked a rise in violence in the occupied West Bank and in Israel. Palestinian militants have attacked and killed Israelis, while there has been a steep rise in settler violence against Palestinians.Data from the UN’s humanitarian office says at least 49 Israelis have been killed by Palestinians in Israel or the West Bank between the start of the war and July 2025. In that time, Israeli forces and civilians have killed at least 968 Palestinians in Israel and the West Bank.On Monday evening, Wafa, the official news agency of the Palestinian Authority, said Israeli forces hadkilled a 14-year-old Palestinianduring a raid in Jenin, in the north of the West Bank. There was no immediate confirmation of the report.The attack took place at the Ramot intersection at the northern entrance to Jerusalem in an area occupied by Israel in 1967 and later annexed – a move the UN and most countries do not recognise. The busy intersection was choked by cars and commuters during the rush hour.Images shared on social media appeared to show a Carlo submachine gun discarded at the scene.These weapons can be crudely manufactured in small metal shops, and models produced by gunsmiths in the West Bank have beenused in attacksby Palestinians on Israelis.While there have been scattered attacks in Israel over recent months, the last deadly mass shooting was in October 2024, when two Palestinians from the West Bank opened fire on a major boulevard and light railway station in the Tel Aviv area, killing seven people and leaving many others wounded. Hamas’s military wing claimed responsibility for that attack.France strongly condemned the attack on Monday in a post on social media. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, offered his condolences to the victims and the Israeli people.“The spiral of violence must come to an end. Only a political solution will bring back peace and stability for all in the region,” he said on X.Spain, the EU, Germany and the United Arab Emirates also issued statements of condemnation.Explore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Per Clausen, a Danish MEP who is a member of the Left group, has called for Europe to propose a temporary transfer to Geneva “both to uphold the Palestinians’ right to be represented and to send a clear signal to Trump”.In a statement at the end of August, the US state department said: “It is in our national security interests to hold the Palestinian Liberation Organisation and the Palestinian Authority accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace.”Trump issues ‘last warning’ to Hamas to accept Gaza ceasefire dealRead moreIt added that, to be considered partners for peace, both groups “must consistently repudiate terrorism, and end incitement to terrorism in education, as required by US law and as promised by the PLO”.It also called on the PA to end its attempts to bypass negotiations through international “lawfare” campaigns, including appeals to the international criminal court and to the international court of justice, and efforts to secure the unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state.The state department argued: “Both steps materially contributed to Hamas’s refusal to release its hostages, and to the breakdown of the Gaza ceasefire talks.”The Palestinian ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, said Abbas had planned to lead the delegation to the UN meetings and was expected to address the general assembly at the high-level general debate, which begins on 23 September.Abbas was also expected to attend a delayed meeting co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia on 22 September about a two-state solution.A group of states will formally recognise the state of Palestine on that day, and Abbas was due to make a series of commitments about PA’s support for exclusively peaceful means to resolve the conflict withIsrael.Abbas was due to meet the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, in London on Monday evening to discuss the plans for a reformed Palestinian leadership.Palestine is an observer member of the UN, meaning it can speak at meetings but not vote on resolutions.Under a 1947 UN agreement, the US is generally required to allow access for foreign diplomats to the UN in New York. Previously in 2019 the US restricted the areas that the Iranian diplomat Javad Zarif was allowed to visit next to the UN headquarters and the Iranian permanent mission.Washington has said it can deny visas for security, extremism and foreign policy reasons.For Brazil, it was not clear if any potential visa restrictions would affect the president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva or lower-level members of the country’s delegation to the UN gathering.Brazil’s president is traditionally the first world leader to speak before the gathered officials on the opening day of the session. The US president is by precedent the second speaker.Lula has been a target of Trump,who objects to the prosecution of the former Brazilian presidentJair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally accused of leading an attempted coup.Explore more on these topicsUnited NationsPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warDonald TrumpNew YorkIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

All three are major suppliers to the Israel Defense Forces, which is beginning an assault onGazaCity where hundreds of thousands of people are estimated to be sheltering after nearly two years of bombardment.IAIandRafael’swebsites confirm that the companies are attending the arms fair, while the DSEI directory says an Elbit Systems subsidiary from Sweden will be exhibiting. In its promotional material, IAI says “we shape the future of global security” with “unmatched strategic capabilities and operational superiority”.The peak point for the protests is expected to be as the show opens on Tuesday morning, with organisers saying there could be anywhere from 500 to 1,000 demonstrators present. “I’ve never seen this level of interest in anti arms trade protests,” Apple said.It is the first time the arms fair has been held since Hamas’s surprise attack on Israel in October 2023, and the event is expected to be intensively policed. Ten people were arrested at the last DSEI in 2023 in a Met operationthat relied on more than 100 officers daily and cost nearly £2m.Though the protests are intended to be separate from the recent pro-Palestine Action demonstrations, it is possible that individuals may choose to show their support for the recently banned direction action group.Almost 900 people were arrestedon Saturday in support of Palestine Action, a group that had targeted Elbit Systems manufacturing sites in the UK, including one in Bristolthat has unexpectedly closed.Also exhibiting is Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor for the F-35 fighter jet used by the Israeli military in the bombing of Gaza. Though the UK government has halted most arms exports to Israel because of legal humanitarian concerns, it has said that British firms can continue to supply components to the US jets because the exports are part of a global programme that it says cannot be separated out.According to a new estimates from Caat, UK companies have supplied £572m of spare parts for F-35s used by Israel since 2016, including from BAE Systems, which supplies the jet’s active interceptor system. UK companies provide about 15% of the overall value of the F-35, which is also used by the Royal Air Force.On Monday, the Ministry of Defence will launch a defence industrial strategy, while Healey will attend DSEI and give a keynote address on Thursday. Labour is planning to increase military spending in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the governing party wants to emphasise the jobs and skills the sector can provide.Ministers will establish a £250m fund to pay for five defence growth deals, boosting defence sub-sectors around the country by bringing together industry, local and national government and academia. A further £182m has been committed to a scheme to establish five defence technical excellence colleges.Healey said the new industrial strategy would make “defence an engine for growth across the UK”. Ministers wanted to make the UK “the best place in the world to start and grow a defence firm,” he said ahead of the launch.Explore more on these topicsArms tradeIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warProtestMiddle East and north AfricaLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

More than 200 were injured and receiving treatment in hospital.The demonstrations have been labelled the “gen Z protest” in a nod to the youth-led movement that circumvented the social media shutdown to mobilise the masses.Many protesters – some out in their school uniforms – sought to emphasise they had taken to the streets as part of a bigger agenda to fight the corruption and nepotism they allege is rampant among Nepal’s political elite, and held up placards with slogans such as “youths against corruption”.The death toll from Monday’s protests intensified anger on the streets and protests continued well into the evening, despite attempts by the government to impose a curfew in areas of unrest. By Monday night, the home minister, Ramesh Lekhak, had resigned in response to the police killings.The UN demanded an immediate probe into the state violence unleashed on the protests.“We are shocked by the killings and injury of protesters in Nepal today and urge a prompt and transparent investigation,” UN human rights office spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said in a statement.The almost blanket social media ban came into effect at midnight on Thursday and subsequently caused chaos across the country, affecting businesses and tourism and leaving people unable to communicate with relatives abroad.LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit and Signal were also among the banned sites.TikTokwas one of the few not restricted – after it complied with the registration order – and it became a key tool of mobilisation.Since the ban, videos contrasting the struggles of ordinary Nepalis with the children of politicians flaunting luxury goods and expensive holidays have gone viral on TikTok, further fuelling anger at the government.Nepal’s ministry of communications and information technology said it had given social media companies seven days to follow the country’s laws and register after a court order, but all but five had failed to meet the deadline. A notice from the ministry said that subsequently an order had been issued to “deactivate” the platforms.The government said the new regulations were aimed at cracking down on hate speech, fake news and online crimes. The ban had already drawn condemnation from international rights organisations. In a statement, the Committee to Protect Journalists NGO warned that the ban set a “dangerous precedent for press freedom”.On Sunday, dozens of journalists had gathered in Kathmandu to protest against the ban, holding up signs with slogans including “no shutdown of social networks”, “no silencing of voices”, “freedom of expression is our right” and “democracy hacked, authoritarianism back”.View image in fullscreenThousands joined in the protest in Kathmandu.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesPrior to Monday’s protests turning violent, the country’s prime minister hit back at critics, saying he would not tolerate the “nation being undermined”.“The independence of the nation is greater than the loss of jobs of a handful of individuals. How can it be acceptable to defy the law, disregard the constitution and disrespect national dignity, independence and sovereignty?” Oli said in a speech on Sunday.While Nepal remains a largely unrestricted country for freedom of expression, critics say there is a growing overreach by the Oli government that has caused concern.In 2023,TikTok was banned for nine monthsover concerns of hate speech and cybercrime but it was reinstated once the platform agreed to register with the government.A series of draft bills governing press freedom and social media are under debate in Nepal’s parliament that could mean people are fined or jailed for content that is deemed against the “national interest”, and could allow the government to shut down newspapers and revoke the licences of journalists.Explore more on these topicsNepalSocial mediaMetaDigital mediaSouth and central AsiaTikTokFacebooknewsShareReuse this content"

But health experts cautioned that it was impossible to capture correctly whether any hospital was “good” or “bad” and that the results could prompt patients to avoid seeking help at lower-rated ones.Streeting said: “We must be honest about the state of theNHSto fix it. Patients and taxpayers have to know how their local NHS services are doing compared to the rest of the country.”League table of NHS trustsThe league tables cover all 205 NHS trusts in England, which provide acute, mental health, community-based or ambulance care. The tables will be updated every three months and are based on 30 different metrics, including how long patients wait for A&E care and planned treatment, the trust’s financial position and patients’ direct experiences.The Department ofHealthand Social Care said that publication marked “the start of a new era of transparency and accountability in the NHS, with league tables delivering on the government’s promise to drive up standards, tackle variation in care and ensure people get the high-quality service they rightly expect”.High-performing trusts will be given greater freedom from NHS England and Whitehall control, while poorer performers will receive “enhanced support” to help them improve.Ministers are reviving the league tables, which were introduced as “star ratings” in 2000 under Tony Blair’s government, to tryto reverse a slump in public satisfaction with the NHS. The coalition government scrapped those ratings in 2010.“This isn’t naming and shaming,” a Department of Health official insisted. “It’s about identifying areas of challenge so we can help trusts make their way up the table.”Thea Stein, the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust thinktank, said the fact that trusts’ finances were used to judge them meant that the league tables would be “of limited use for patients trying to choose the best hospital for their care”.She added: “The scheme also risks discouraging people from getting treatment from poorly performing trusts or staff from working for them.”Small trusts, and those in remote areas, some of which have struggled to provide high-quality care, could be badly affected, Stein said.Danielle Jefferies, an analyst at the King’s Fund thinktank, saidin a blogpost: “Whether these league tables will be helpful to the public is questionable, because hospital performance is not as simple as good or bad.”A hospital might have short A&E waiting times but not give patients access to non-urgent care within the 18-week target or a cancer diagnosis within 28 days, she said. Jefferies added that a single overall rating for a trust could not properly convey the range of performance when one trust ran a number of hospitals, such as the 10 operated by the Manchester University trust.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A lower score denotes a higher-performing trust.The best performers were trusts that provided specialist care, such as first-placed Moorfields, the Royal national orthopaedic hospital in outer London (second), Christie cancer hospital in Manchester (third) and Liverpool heart and chest hospital (fourth).Northumbria, ranked ninth, was the best-performing non-specialist acute hospital, followed by University College London.Papers for a Moorfields board meeting in July show that it was the 10th best performer in England for patients waiting 18 weeks for elective care, third for providing diagnostic tests within six weeks and second for four-hour A&E performance.Meanwhile, Labour politicians were warned on Tuesday that they could lose the next election to Reform UK unless they transform health and local NHS services in England’s poorest areas.The warning was contained in research for the Independent Commission on Neighbourhoods, chaired by Labour grandee Hilary Armstrong.Ministers need to ensure that the network of promised “neighbourhood health centres”, offering a range of NHS services, opens in deprived areas as soon as possible, the report said, adding: “Getting this right could be the difference in the government being re-elected or returning to opposition.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHospitalsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s in line with other large-scale events we’ve put on as a force.”Speaking on the restricted airspace order, he said: “Obviously it’s an offence to fly a drone in a restricted airspace and we will have resources to deal with any of those incursions.“We will have plenty of capability in the sky when the time is appropriate,” he said, adding that the drones will act as an “eye in the sky” during the event.It will be Trump’s second state visit to the UK – an unprecedented gesture towards a US president – after he came in 2019.His first trip to the UK saw thousands of people turn out on the streets in London in opposition.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpForeign policyMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

It did not say how much the meal deals will cost.In the UK, meal deals will be tested across two parts of the day – a croissant and coffee for breakfast; crisps and a bread-based sandwich; and also any lunch main, snack and a drink.In January Pret launched a meal deal in France, which is performing well.“Going forward our priority will be to drive transactions and sustainable growth by offering great value for money for Pret customers,” said Pano Christou, the chief executive of Pret.Supermarkets and other high street retailers have long offered meal deals, offering a sandwich, snack and drink for a set price. These have been creeping up in price amidrising food inflation, with Tesco recentlyincreasing the price of its meal deal by 25pto £3.85 for Clubcard holders, its third increase since 2022.Pret’s parent company, JAB, which bought the chain from the British private equity company Bridgepointfor £1.5bn in 2018, revealed that Pret made a £525.5m pre-tax loss last year.The company, which made a £61.7m loss in 2023, was hit by a £552.9m non-cash writedown, which is understood to relate to how JAB assessed the value of the brand, its properties and other assets linked to Pret.The writedown equates to slashing the value of the chain by about a third compared with its acquisition price.In a filing, the company said that it had never previously recorded an impairment charge for the business but considered last year to be the first since the onset of Covid with “consistent trading data to base future forecasts”.The company said the impairment in value had taken into account the current uncertain global macroeconomic environment, as well as additional costs arising from last autumn’s budget, which included arise in employer national insurance contributions and an increase in the minimum wage.After adjusting for the non-cash impairments, Pret made a £98m operational profit, a 36% year-on-year increase.Like-for-like sales grew 2.8% and total revenues including new openings grew by 10% to £1.2bn.“2024 was another year of growth for Pret, where we took disciplined decisions to protect sales, despite intense strains on the hospitality industry,” Christou said.The company revealed that the total number of directly employed staff fell by almost 1,400 last year, a 14% drop from 9,541 to 8,165, because of the sale of stores. Overall, including in franchise stores, the company has 12,000 staff worldwide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is a cosmetic rebranding, tweaking and expansion of the same unreliable and punishing system as the one before. It still includes many of the risks that teachers and headteachers fear, without significant benefits or safeguards,” Waters said.A letter signed by Waters, trade unions, former school inspectors and mental health experts has been sent to Phillipson stating thatOfstedhas failed to learn the lessons of Perry’s death and calling on the secretary of state to intervene.Perry killed herself in 2023 after Caversham primary school, which she had led for more than a decade, was downgraded from Ofsted’s current highest grade of outstanding to its lowest, inadequate, over safeguarding concerns.Berkshire’s senior coroner ruled her suicide was “contributed to by an Ofsted inspection”, after an inquest heard testimony from colleagues and medical professionals of the mental distress Perry suffered during and after the inspection.Ofsted said it had listened carefully to feedback from parents and professionals and had made a number of alterations to its original proposals after they were put out for public consultation earlier this year, attracting 6,500 responses, of which many were hostile.Under the new regime, inspectors will look at a wider range of aspects of a school including curriculum and teaching, attendance and behaviour, leadership and governance, achievement and inclusion.Each evaluation area will receive a grade, ranging from “exceptional” to “strong standard”, “expected standard”, “needs attention” and “urgent improvement”, offering parents a more granular and nuanced portrait of how a school is performing, Ofsted said.The report card will also include a section on safeguarding, assessing whether standards have been met or not. The single overall judgment for a school, which has been seen as particularly problematic, wasscrapped in September 2024.Phillipson said:“New school report cards will raise the bar for standards across the board, shining a light on what’s working and where change is needed. By providing a fuller picture of school performance – from attendance and behaviour to inclusion – we’re giving parents the transparency they deserve and schools the tools to improve.”Ofsted said a YouGov poll found almost seven in 10 parents surveyed preferred the new-look report cards to Ofsted’s current inspection reports, but unions and school leaders expressed grave reservations about the “rushed” timetable, with new inspections starting on 10 November.Pepe Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Let’s remember that this entire process began with the suicide of a headteacher under the previous inspection system. Yet here we are with a reformed system which appears to be even worse.”Announcing the new regime on Monday, the chief inspector of schools in England, Martyn Oliver, said: “Children deserve the best possible education; their parents deserve the best possible information and education professionals deserve to have their work fairly assessed by experts. The changes we are presenting today aim to achieve all three of these things.”Where areas for improvement are identified, schools and colleges will receive additional monitoring inspections to ensure rapid progress, while nurseries and childminders will be inspected every four years instead of six.Oliver said there would be a new focus on inclusion, and on disadvantaged and vulnerable children, as well as a more collaborative approach to inspection, paying greater attention to school leaders’ wellbeing and workload. Each inspection team will have an additional inspector to add capacity.Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “We completely reject that a Nando’s-style 1-5 grading scale is good for children or parents. Report cards won’t help keep children safe, boost good teaching or motivate learning.”Jon Coles, the chief executive of United Learning, England’s largest academy trust, was more positive. “It is important to our school system, to parental confidence and ultimately to the success of children that there is high-quality, trusted, independent and rigorous reporting to parents about the quality of their local schools. I am pleased that the new inspection framework looks set to provide this,” he said.The shadow education secretary, Laura Trott, said: “Labour are destroying school standards just to play to the tune of the unions. They’re replacing the rigorous inspections that were key to improving our schools with a hollow, watered-down system.”Explore more on these topicsOfstedSchoolsTeachingEducation policyEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The EU has a goal to ban it in all its marine protected areas by 2030, Sweden has banned it, as has Greece. The lack of a ban in so-called “protected areas” has led to environmental groups referring to MPAs in the UKas “paper parks”.The Commons committee has written to the new environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, asking her to reconsider a complete ban on bottom trawling within offshore MPAs and to clarify whether she will seek to ensure the government’s approach does not undermine the integrity of protected waters.The issue became more prominent after being highlighted ina film by Sir David Attenborough releasedearlier this year to coincide with his 99th birthday.It showed the barren destruction left in the wake of the trawlers, with areas that once thronged with fish, seahorses and other marine life decimated.“The idea of bulldozing a rainforest causes outrage, yet we do the same underwater every day,” says Attenborough in the film. “Surely you would argue it must be illegal.”The chair of the committee, Toby Perkins MP, said: “Bottom trawling is a destructive practice. We hugely welcome the government moving forward with banning it in more protected areas of our oceans.“However, the committee is disappointed that the government has not committed to wider bans within marine protected areas which risk undermining the integrity of marine protected areas.”A Defra spokesperson said: “Restoring our oceans to good health is essential for both nature and for fishing businesses.“This government is taking decisive steps to ban bottom trawling when it is damaging protected seabeds, and our consultation makes clear how this would be implemented appropriately.”Explore more on these topicsFishingFishing industryEnglandConservationGreen politicsMarine lifenewsShareReuse this content"

They say the social media company, which owns Facebook, Instagram, and offers a line of VR headsets and games, deleted or doctored internal safety research that showed children being exposed to grooming, sexual harassment and violence in its 3D realms.“Meta knew that underage children were using its products, but figured, ‘Hey, kids drive engagement,’ and it was making them cash,” Jason Sattizahn, one of the whistleblowers who worked on the company’s VR research, said in a statement. “Meta has compromised their internal teams to manipulate research and straight-up erase data that they don’t like.”Sattizahn and the other whistleblowers, all current or former Meta employees, have disclosed these findings and a trove of documents to Congress, according tothe Washington Post, which first reported the allegations. Sattizahn and Cayce Savage, who was Meta’s lead researcher on youth user experience for VR, will appear before the US Senate judiciary subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law on Tuesday.Zuckerberg tells parents of social media victims at Senate hearing: ‘I’m sorry for everything you’ve been through’Read moreDani Lever, a Meta spokesperson, said the company has approved 180 studies related to its VR Reality Labs since 2022, which include research on youth safety and wellbeing.“These few examples are being stitched together to fit a predetermined and false narrative,” she said, adding that Meta has introduced features to its VR products to limit unwanted contact and supervision tools for parents.Meta has not done enough to safeguard children, whistleblower saysRead moreThe whistleblower allegations made public on Monday claim that on Meta’s VR products, the company could have done more to ensure children’s safety. The whistleblowers say company managers instructed staff to avoid research that might show evidence of child harm in virtual reality.In one instance, a researcher was reportedly told to “swallow that ick”.In another instance, a researcher was allegedly told to delete information from an interview they had conducted with a German family, according to the Washington Post. During that interview, a teenage boy told the researcher that his brother, who was under the age of 10, had “frequently encountered strangers” in Meta’s VR and that “adults had sexually propositioned his little brother”.The allegations arise as a steady procession of former Meta employees havecome forward to criticize the companyfor not doing enough to protect children from harm on its social media products. Lawmakers have also repeatedly grilled Meta executives for pushing content to youth that promotes bullying, drug abuse and self-harm.At one congressional hearing in January 2024, Republican senator Josh Hawley prodded Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, intopublicly apologizing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Inside the sketch of a woman’s torso, the note depicts an imagined conversation between Trump and Epstein, with what appeared to be Trump’s signature below.“The oversight committee has secured the infamous ‘Birthday Book’ that contains a note from President Trump that he has said does not exist,” Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the panel, said in a statement. “It’s time for the president to tell us the truth about what he knew and release all the Epstein files.”The White House did not immediately comment on the letter, but officials sought to discredit the note. Deputy chief of staff for communications, Taylor Budowich, suggested in an X post carrying a different version of Trump’s signature that the letter or the signature had been falsified.“Time for news corp to open that check book, it’s not his signature. DEFAMATION!” Budowich wrote, referencing thedefamation suit that Trump filedagainst News Corp, the parent company of the Journal, over its original story.But even though Trump more recently has signed both his first and last name together, for years, he used only his first name in signatures, stylized with a line extending from the last letter – and Trump’s signature on a letter from 1995 closely resembled the one found on the note to Epstein.Trump has separately denied drawing the figure or writing the note to Epstein. “The supposed letter they printed by President Trump to Epstein was a FAKE,” he said in July.View image in fullscreenA protester calls for the release of the Epstein files in Washington last week.Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty ImagesThe letter from the so-called birthday book was turned over to the House oversight committee in response to a subpoena issued by its Republican chairperson James Comer, and a 25 July letter fromDemocratsSylvia Garcia and Ro Khanna urging Epstein’s estate to produce the materials.The committee later also releasedthe entirety of the birthday book, which scanned pages showed was titled “The First Fifty Years” and was split into 10 sections including a prologue written by Epstein’s associate Ghislane Maxwell.The leather-bound volume contained dozens of letters and images that were of a sexually explicit nature, ranging from drawings by “girlfriends” of Epstein receiving massages next to a pool, to photos of lions and zebras engaged in sex.Other contributors included Bill Clinton, the billionaire Leon Black, Harvard law school professor and onetime Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz, the now British ambassador to the US Peter Mandelson and Les Wexner, among others.Trump vehemently denied having written or illustrated the note, dismissing it as “a fake thing” and insisting “these are not my words, not the way I talk”.He later filed the defamation suit against the Journal’s reporters, publisher Dow Jones and News Corp. In response, a Dow Jones spokeswoman said: “We have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting.” The lawsuit sought $10bn in damages and specifically named media mogul Rupert Murdoch.Meanwhile, the Trump administration has spent months shifting its position on whether Epstein-related files would be released or even if they existed at all, with Trump at one point calling them a “Democrat hoax”.The House oversight committee, with participation from Democrats and Republicans, continues to review Epstein-related records. Epstein, a wealthy financier with numerous powerful connections, died by suicide in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinUS politicsDonald TrumpDemocratsHouse of RepresentativesUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

It also conserves the media company’s conservative bent; Lachlan Murdoch is regarded as the most conservative of Murdoch’s oldest children.Lachlan is the current chair of News Corp, the parent company of over two dozen publications including the Journal,The Timesand the New York Post, after he succeeded his father in 2023.Rupert Murdoch’s children with his third wife Wendy Deng, Chloe and Grace, will join Lachlan in a new family trust that will hold controlling stakes in Fox Corporation and News Corp, the Murdochs’ media groups. Under the agreement, Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch and James Murdoch will be the beneficiaries of a trust that will house the proceeds of the sale.The three children took their father to court in Reno, Nevada, after he tried to wrest away their voting power and leave Lachlan with sole control of the companies in a project Murdoch reportedly named “Project Family Harmony”.According tocourt records, Murdoch told others in private that while he wanted harmony in the family, he believed Lachlan was the best to lead his media empire into the future.“Would love nothing more than peace all around,” he wrote to his ex-wife Anna, the mother of Elisabeth, Lachlan and James. “But the fact remains Lachlan is the best to run the business — greatly respected inside and outside!”During the legal dispute, Murdoch told his eldest children, according tothe New York Times: “These companies are my legacy. I have put everything into them over my life.” He described his media assets as a “protector of the conservative voice in the English-speaking world” and argued only Lachlan’s leadership could protect them in that role.Family and political differences appear to have driven a wedge between Lachlan and his siblings. James Murdoch has been a vocal critic of the political slant of the family business, particularly onclimate changeand its support of Donald Trump, who iscurrently suingMurdoch’s the Wall Street Journal.In a rare interview earlier published this year, James Murdochtold the Atlanticmagazine that he regarded his father as a “misogynist” and described Fox News as a “menace” to US democracy. According to the article, James and Rupert had barely spoken in years.The family finally agreed on a buyout after the case, which happenedout of public eyefor months, went into appeals, according to theNew York Times.Last December, Nevada commissioner Edmund Gorman concluded that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch had acted in “bad faith” in their attempts to change the terms of an irrevocable trust that divided control of the company between Murdoch’s four oldest children.Gorman’s scathing 96-page opinion accused Murdoch and his eldest son of a “carefully crafted charade” to “permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch’s executive roles”.Lachlan Murdoch is now the de facto heir to one of the world’s most powerful media businesses. As well as Fox News and Fox Sports and the multinational newspaper business, the Murdochs control publisher Harper Collins and the fast-growingTubi, a free streaming service.“News Corp’s board of directors welcomes these developments and believes that the leadership, vision and management by the Company’s Chair, Lachlan Murdoch, will continue to be important to guiding the Company’s strategy and success,” News Corp said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsRupert MurdochWall Street JournalNewspapersUS press and publishingNewspapers & magazinesFox NewsThe TimesnewsShareReuse this content"

It also conserves the media company’s conservative bent; Lachlan Murdoch is regarded as the most conservative of Murdoch’s oldest children.Lachlan is the current chair of News Corp, the parent company of over two dozen publications including the Journal,The Timesand the New York Post, after he succeeded his father in 2023.Rupert Murdoch’s children with his third wife Wendy Deng, Chloe and Grace, will join Lachlan in a new family trust that will hold controlling stakes in Fox Corporation and News Corp, the Murdochs’ media groups. Under the agreement, Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch and James Murdoch will be the beneficiaries of a trust that will house the proceeds of the sale.The three children took their father to court in Reno, Nevada, after he tried to wrest away their voting power and leave Lachlan with sole control of the companies in a project Murdoch reportedly named “Project Family Harmony”.According tocourt records, Murdoch told others in private that while he wanted harmony in the family, he believed Lachlan was the best to lead his media empire into the future.“Would love nothing more than peace all around,” he wrote to his ex-wife Anna, the mother of Elisabeth, Lachlan and James. “But the fact remains Lachlan is the best to run the business — greatly respected inside and outside!”During the legal dispute, Murdoch told his eldest children, according tothe New York Times: “These companies are my legacy. I have put everything into them over my life.” He described his media assets as a “protector of the conservative voice in the English-speaking world” and argued only Lachlan’s leadership could protect them in that role.Family and political differences appear to have driven a wedge between Lachlan and his siblings. James Murdoch has been a vocal critic of the political slant of the family business, particularly onclimate changeand its support of Donald Trump, who iscurrently suingMurdoch’s the Wall Street Journal.In a rare interview earlier published this year, James Murdochtold the Atlanticmagazine that he regarded his father as a “misogynist” and described Fox News as a “menace” to US democracy. According to the article, James and Rupert had barely spoken in years.The family finally agreed on a buyout after the case, which happenedout of public eyefor months, went into appeals, according to theNew York Times.Last December, Nevada commissioner Edmund Gorman concluded that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch had acted in “bad faith” in their attempts to change the terms of an irrevocable trust that divided control of the company between Murdoch’s four oldest children.Gorman’s scathing 96-page opinion accused Murdoch and his eldest son of a “carefully crafted charade” to “permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch’s executive roles”.Lachlan Murdoch is now the de facto heir to one of the world’s most powerful media businesses. As well as Fox News and Fox Sports and the multinational newspaper business, the Murdochs control publisher Harper Collins and the fast-growingTubi, a free streaming service.“News Corp’s board of directors welcomes these developments and believes that the leadership, vision and management by the Company’s Chair, Lachlan Murdoch, will continue to be important to guiding the Company’s strategy and success,” News Corp said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsRupert MurdochWall Street JournalNewspapersUS press and publishingNewspapers & magazinesFox NewsThe TimesnewsShareReuse this content"

Does he want to win?Callum Jonesin New YorkThe president has claimed any decision against him would ‘destroy’ the ‘financial fabric of our country’Mon 8 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 8 Sep 2025 10.33 EDTShareDonald Trumphas upended the global economy, imposing steep tariffs on US allies and rivals, dismissing fears of higher prices, and promising his strategy will yield a new “golden age”. All the president needs to do now is prove he’s allowed to do it.Legal experts say he may face an uphill battle.In May, theUS court of international traderuled that the bulk of Trump’s tariffs “exceed any authority granted to the president”. And last Friday, theUS court of appeals for the federal circuitruled that Trump’s levies “assert an expansive authority that is beyond the express limitations” of the law his administration has leaned on.Now Trump is taking the case to the supreme court, claiming any decision against him would “destroy” the US.The appeals court has paused its ruling, allowing the tariffs to remain in place until 14 October. The administration wants the supreme court to move swiftly; the solicitor general, D John Sauer, has requested the justices decide by Wednesday 10 September, whether to pick up the case. Oral argument could take place in the first week of November, he suggested.In a filing this week, Sauer claimed the appeals court’s “erroneous” decision had “disrupted highly impactful sensitive ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations and cast pall of legal uncertainty over the President’s efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign policy crisis”.It sets the stage for the biggest legal test yet of Trump’s controversial and fundamental rewrite of US trade strategy, hiking tariffs on foreign goods to their highest levels in the best part of a century.Mark Graber, a leading scholar on constitutional law and politics at the University of Maryland, expects the administration to ultimately lose the case. “This is an issue that really splits the Trump coalition,” he said. “If it splits the Trump coalition, it probably splits the Trump coalition on the bench.”The US supreme court is dominated by conservative justices, with six of the nine nominated by Republican presidents, including three by Trump. This supermajority hasgranted Trump 18 straight victoriesin the administration’s requests for emergency relief – and been accused by Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal-leaning justice, of undermining the bedrock principle that America is a “government of laws, not of men”.“It won’t surprise me if a number of Republicans on the supreme bench actually jump on this one,” continued Graber, who believes four of the court’s conservative voices could be persuaded to vote against the tariffs, perhaps in part to counter the narrative that the court has been hijacked by the right. “I don’t think the [John] Roberts, [Amy Coney] Barrett, [Brett] Kavanaugh people are really very thrilled about tariffs. Probably not [Neil] Gorsuch, either.“I think this court would love to have a case where it doesn’t side with the administration,” he said. “This strikes me as a perfect case” to counter the perception that the supreme court is stacked with “stooges for Trump”.At the heart of the case lies the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, a US federal law invoked by Trump. The administration has cited the shipping of fentanyl into the US, and its trade deficits – how much more it imports than exports – as emergencies.Trump asks US supreme court to overturn trade tariffs rulingRead moreThe word “tariff” does not even appear in the law, however, raising questions over whether it grants the president sufficient power.The IEEPA “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency”, the appeals court majority wrote, “but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax”.While Congress has long delegated authority to impose or change tariffs, it has typically been explicit when doing so. But the IEEPA states that presidents can “regulate importation”, and Trump’s allies argue this grants broad powers that could – and can – include tariffs.The supreme court might be swayed by such an argument, Jonathan Adler, a professor at William & Mary Law School,wrotein the Wall Street Journal: “The whole point of enacting statutes like IEEPA is to give the president broad authority to address emergencies when they arise.”Presidential powers tend to be at their strongest on foreign policy and national security, Adler noted, adding: “While IEEPA provides that such actions may ‘only be exercised’ to address such declared emergencies ‘and may not be exercised for any other purpose’, courts have rarely felt competent to second-guess the executive branch’s national-security determinations.”Should the supreme court ultimately side with Trump, it will embolden the administration to press ahead with his aggressive economic strategy. But should it decide his tariffs are unlawful, the president has claimed the “financial fabric of our country” is on the line.Despite such stark warnings, some have questioned whether Trump’s rhetoric on tariffs really reflects how he feels. “We normally think people litigate to win. But in fact, quite frequently people litigate to lose,” said Graber, at the University of Maryland. “The point was publicity.”Trump “will not mind a loss” in this case, claimed Graber. “One of the virtues Trump gets by litigating this loser of a case is he can tell everybody: ‘I fought for tariffs, I fought for you, it’s just those elitist judges who stopped me,’” he said. “He gets credit for the tariffs, and he doesn’t get the fallout that tariffs would actually create, because they’re declared illegal.”Either way, the wheels of justice turn slowly. A decision by the supreme court could take months. All the while, Trump’s tariffs remain in force.The administration argues higher duties are strengthening the world’s largest economy, persuading nations to scramble to strike trade deals with the US. But there areearly signs of strain, and the deals that have materialized are not substantial.The umpire who picked a side: John Roberts and the death of rule of law in AmericaRead moreIn areportreleased this week, Michael Negron, of the Center for American Progress, a leading liberal thinktank, argued Trump’s “irrational, unpredictable” approach to policymaking and government had imposed a “turbulence tax” on US consumers and businesses.“It’s just something that ​everybody’s paying,” Negron, an economic adviser in the Biden White House, said. “At the root of it is this unstable, unpredictable way in which he does his business.”He added: “If he had said at the beginning of this process, ‘I am setting a 15% tariff … you can take that to the bank’, and he wasn’t changing the policy every couple of weeks, and he wasn’t issuing new threats, and he wasn’t announcing deals that when you look into them aren’t actually significant – just one, flat number – I think that would have been received much better, and would have proven less costly, than the ups and downs, and the ups and downs, and the ups and downs.”If you’re a small-business owner counting the cost of more expensive imports, or a consumer wandering the aisles of your grocery store and wondering why the bill for your weekly shop is still growing, it’s hard to know what’s coming next.But one thing’s for sure: no matter how this case is ultimately settled, the turbulence is unlikely to subside.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS supreme courtUS foreign policyUS domestic policyDonald TrumpUS politicsTariffsanalysisShareReuse this content"

According to the AFL-CIO, the US’s largest labor federation, states with right-to-work lawsreceived36% higher discrimination charges from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on average.Right-to-work laws allow workers represented by unions to stop paying dues for the services and benefits they receive through union representation, depleting resources from labor unions. Public sector workers in all 50 states have also had their collective bargaining rights stripped through the imposition of right-to-work laws by the US supreme court’s 2018 decisionJanus v AFSCME.In 2024, states that protect collective bargaining saw an increase of nearly 10,000 union members, compared with the loss of 200,000 union members in states with right-to-work laws.The report analyzed the impact of Illinois’ 2022 constitutional amendment that guarantees the right of collective bargaining and bans right-to-work laws. Illinois added 27,000 union members in 2024, increasing its unionization rate to 13.1%. Illinois organized more union members from 2022 through 2024, 18,300 members, than the previous seven years combined, the report states.The report found union members in Illinois are also 8.3% more likely to own homes, 5.2% more likely to have health insurance coverage, and 1 to 4 percentage points less likely to rely on government assistance programs such as Medicaid and Snap food assistance benefits.Similar results were found in Michigan in the wake ofrepealingthe state’s “right to work” law in 2023. Nearly 15,000 union members were added in Michigan from 2023 to 2024.The report comes as the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and the California representative Brad Sherman havereintroducedthe nationwide right to unionize act last week, a bill to invalidate right-to-work laws that weaken unions’ ability to organize workers.Frank Manzo, co-author of the report and an economist at the Illinois Economic Policy Institute, noted that despite the headwinds facing labor unions in terms of the Janus decision, weak labor laws and overwhelmingly opposition to unionization from employers, unions have remained steadfast in states that protect collective bargaining while declining in those that do not.“It’s all occurring at a time when support for unions remains high and bipartisan, with seven in 10 Americans approving unions, and millions of workers reporting that they would join unions and would organize their workplaces if they could, per surveys,” said Manzo. “The economy does better, workers do better and taxpayers do better when states and the federal government allows and, in fact, encourages workers to collectively bargain.”“It is very difficult to organize a union, and it is difficult to get a first contract. When the law, the politics and the infrastructure are intentionally designed to disincentivize and to keep, if not outright prevent, workers from having a collective voice, it shouldn’t be surprising to see some dilution, some reduction in density,” said Dr Robert Bruno, co-author of the report and director of the Project for Middle Class Renewal.“The state of the labor movement is not only tied to economic prosperity for working people, but it’s relevant to democracy,” he added. “Attacking a union, attacking the labor movement, is a way to restrain, limit and diminish democracy in society.”Explore more on these topicsUS unionsUS supreme courtnewsShareReuse this content"

TfL’s online journey planner and its TfL Go app struggled under the weight of searches, failing to load and returning error messages or no results.Commuter misery deepens as TfL website crashes on first day of tube strikes; China’s exports hit by US tariff tensions– business liveRead moreCongested roads added considerable time to bus journeys, as well as for those turning to private cars and taxis.The ride-hailing app Uber warned users of higher fares because of increased demand. Rides were quoted at multiples of normal levels, with some journeys costing about £50 for a five-mile trip in the capital.Two wheels proved a better option for many: TfL’s cycle hire scheme had more than 20,000 hires by 3pm, double the previous Monday’s rate. The e-bike rental company Lime said it had 58% more users on Monday morning, while the rival Forest said it had doubled its rush-hour usage.About 10,000 members of the RMTare taking part in rolling industrial actionin the tube row, as the union attempts to secure a shorter working week as part of pay negotiations. Signallers and controllers will strike on Tuesday.TfL has made a pay offer of 3.4%, which it urged the union to put to its members in a fresh ballot. It has said it cannot meet demands to cut hours below the current 35 a week.Downing Street called on both sides to get back to the negotiating table. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “I think Londoners will rightly be fed up with the disruption from tube strikes this morning – as parents try to drop their kids off at school, get to hospital appointments, get to work – and RMT and TfL need to get back around the table, work together to resolve this dispute in the interests of passengers.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have been clear that their demand for a reduction in the working week is unaffordable and impractical, and we urge them to put our offer to their members.“We know how economically damaging strike action can be for businesses, especially in the hospitality and leisure sectors, and have worked extremely hard to deliver as much service as possible to keep London moving despite the strike action this morning.“We will continue to do so throughout this week but we are unable to say with certainty what that service will look like on a day-to-day basis due to the different groups of staff striking on each day.”An RMT spokesperson said: “We are not going on strike to disrupt small businesses or the public. This strike is going ahead because of the intransigent approach of TfL management and their refusal to even consider a small reduction in the working week in order to help reduce fatigue and the ill-health effects of long-term shift work on our members.”Support for the union came from the 4 Day Week Foundation. Joe Ryle, its campaign director, said: “It’s a bold and necessary stand, and these workers deserve widespread support. The five-day week is a century-old model that no longer reflects how we live and work today.”Underground services are not expected to resume until 8am on Friday should the strikes continue.Explore more on these topicsLondon UndergroundTfLRail transportLondonTransportRail industryIndustrial actionnewsShareReuse this content"

Imports grew by 1.3%, down from a 4.1% rise in July.Beijing’s shipments to the US fell by 33% while exports to southeast Asian nations rose by 22.5%. Policymakers want manufacturers to shift to other markets in light of Donald Trump’s erratic trade policy.The US president delayed sweeping tariffs on China in mid-August, announcing another 90-day pause just hours before the last agreement between the the world’s two largest economies was due to expire.Trump had threatened tariffs on China as high as 245%, with China threatening retaliatory tariffs of 125%. However, Chinese imports are subject to a a baseline tariff of 10% and a 20% extra levy in response to fentanyl smugglingallegationsagainst China. Some products are taxed at higher rates.China’s trade surplus rose to $102.3bn in August from $98.2bn in July, but below June’s $114.8bn. Analysts are waiting to see whether officials will rollout extra fiscal support measures in the fourth quarter to revive domestic demand.Separately, Germany’s exports fell unexpectedly in July while industrial production rose.Shipments from Europe’s biggest economy dropped by 0.6% from the previous month, against economists’ forecasts of a 0.1% gain. Imports were also down, by 0.1%. The country’s foreign trade surplus reduced to €14.7bn from €15.4bn in June, and compared with €17.7bn in July 2024.On a brighter note, German industrial production rose by 1.3% in July.Oil prices climbed, recouping some of last week’s losses, after the oil cartel Opec and allies such as Russia, known as Opec+, agreed over the weekend to raise output at a slower pace from October on expectations of weaker global demand. The possibility of more sanctions on Russia, a major oil exporter, also rose after Moscow’s overnight strike on Ukraine.Brent crude rose by 1.5% to $66.45 a barrel.On Sunday, eight members of OPEC+ agreed to lift production from October by 137,000 barrels per day, far below the monthly increases of 555,000 bpd in September and August, and 411,000 bpd in July and June.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And the toxic elements of her fanbase have lost a culture-war totemEtan ThomasMon 8 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 8 Sep 2025 05.01 EDTShareCaitlin Clark’s season is over. The Indiana Feverconfirmed on Thursday nightwhat many suspected, when the 2024 rookie of the year announced on social media that she would not be returning this year from the groin injury that has limited her to 13 games.“I had hoped to share a better update, but I will not be returning to play this season,” she wrote. “Disappointed isn’t a big enough word … This has been incredibly frustrating, but even in the bad, there is good. The way the fans continued to show up … brought me so much joy and perspective.”Caitlin Clark says her WNBA season is over: ‘Disappointed isn’t a big enough word’Read moreIt was a statement full of grace, perspective and a focus on the team. Yet for the mob that has attached itself to Clark, this was not enough. Their outrage was instantaneous, not because Clark is missing the rest of the year, but because they have lost the ability to use her as a weapon in their endless culture wars.Some of her so-called fans on X predicted the WNBA “will fade back into obscurity” without Clark, or that “other players couldn’t wait to hurt her”, ignoring the fact that theratings for the league remain robustand the Whas always been a tough, physical league, even before Clark’s arrival.The reality is that Clark’s absence is the only sensible outcome. Athletes are programmed to want to play through pain. From middle-school gyms to NBA locker rooms, the slogans on the wall all say the same thing:pain is weakness leaving the body;what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. Of course Clark wanted to return, just asTyrese Haliburton wanted to playfor the Pacers in the NBA finals, just as Robert Griffin III wanted to play for Washington in the NFL playoffs. That is what competitors do.But this is why medical professionals exist. It is their job to say no, to draw the line, to protect players from themselves. Time and again they have failed in that responsibility –Haliburton worsening his injuryby suiting up in June is only the most recent example – and the careers of countless stars have been shortened because team doctors bowed to short-term pressures. Clark’s rushed comeback in July carried the same whiff of desperation: a marquee game against New York, All-Star weekend, national television. She did not look right even before breaking down again.The Fever, at least, appear to have learned the lesson. Even thought they have made the playoffs, they are unlikely to topple the juggernaut Minnesota Lynx. Risking their franchise player’s long-term health for a token playoff berth would be malpractice. For anyone who actually cares about Clark, shutting her down should be a relief. Better to lose a few months than an entire career.But the mob thathas turned her into a political totemdoes not care about her health, or her wishes.Clark has asked repeatedlynot to be used to promote racism, grievance and white-supremacist narratives. Those pleas have gone unheard. To her most toxic followers, she is not a player but a symbol: the “great white hope”, the damsel under attack from jealous Black opponents. With her sidelined, those narratives lose their fuel. No fouls to inflate into morality plays, no on-court moments to twist into evidence of persecution.This, more than anything else, is what enrages them. Not that Clark is out. Not that the Fever’s playoff hopes are dimmed. But that their favorite weapon is gone, at least until next season.For the rest of us, the conclusion is clear. Clark’s season is finished, and that is a loss for theWNBA. But the decision protects her future and strips her name from the ugliest corners of the discourse. That is worth far more than a doomed playoff run.Explore more on these topicsCaitlin ClarkWNBAIndiana FeverBasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Aaron Rodgers led the Steelers to a 34-32 win over the Jets, his former team, and over a coaching staff thatfired himbefore they had the decency to check out his crystal collection.“I was happy to beat everybody associated with the Jets,” Rodgers said on Sunday, after throwing for 244 yards and four touchdowns in his Pittsburgh debut.NFL roundup: Bills storm back from 15 points down in fourth quarter to beat Ravens in instant classicRead moreRodgers spent two bleak seasons with the Jets. First came the torn achilles that ended his first campaign almost before it began. Then, he slogged his way through a second year of mismanagement, playing for a franchise that effectively waved the white flag before Halloween. In Sunday’s comeback, he offered a glimpse of what could have been.This was not vintage Rodgers. He is not the same as he was during his final years in Green Bay. At 41, he’s a little stiffer, more cautious, happy to dump the ball off to avoid getting hit. The four-time MVP is no longer the artist he was at his apex, the backfield ballerina who could create magic out of nothing. These days, he takes sacks in slow motion, unable to avoid the oncoming rush. But he is still has a supercomputer between his ears, a high-powered arm and a preternatural feel for how to punish defenses.Ask Rodgers to be the driving force of an offense in 2025, and you’re heading nowhere. But slot him in a role as the league’s pre-eminent quarterback-as-point-guard, with weapons at receiver and a complementary defense, and he can carry a franchise far.There were times on Sunday when Rodgers’s flaws were exposed. He was sacked on his first play from scrimmage and was fortunate not to throw the game away with a late fourth-quarter misfire. But beyond the stat line, Rodgers showed a willingness to reimagine his game, to accept the player he is today rather than what he was during his MVP years. And the Steelers have built an offense around that reality.“I love the organization. I love them taking a chance on bringing me in,” Rodgers told CBS after the game. “There’s a lot of garbage being talked about myself or [offensive coordinator Arthur Smith] or how we would coexist.”Whether or not Rodgers would subsume himself to the Steelers’ offense or force his own ideals on the coaching staff was an open question. Those were answered on Sunday. He was happy to hand over the reins in a way he never did in New York, playing with a quick trigger and shuffled outside the pocket on Smith’s designed rollouts and bootlegs. When needed, he proved he can still thread the ball into tight windows.The Steelers still needed help. The team’s vaunted pass-rush drew a blank against the Jets’ offensive line, giving Justin Fields time to carve them up for 266 yards and three touchdowns combined through the air and on the ground. Jets linebacker Quincy Williams helped bail out a Steelers stalled drive with an avoidable unnecessary roughness penalty, which Rodgers punished with his third touchdown. And when DK Metcalf somehow hauled in a late reception that bounced fortuitously off two players, Chris Boswell nailed the 60-yard game-winning field goal.Through a couple hands. Not your ordinary reception.PITvsNYJ on CBS/Paramount+https://t.co/HkKw7uXVntpic.twitter.com/4zsjaHEWv2— NFL (@NFL)September 7, 2025“Our kicker is a serial killer,” Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said. “He has a low pulse rate … and he cannot wait to deliver.”Winning shootouts is not a formula for winning a playoff berth, not at this stage of Rodgers’s career. But the foundations of something are there: Rodgers refusing to turn the ball over and then turning the game over to his defense and kicker.For the Jets, the loss will sting. Rodgers spent much of his two years in New York vacillating between off-field distraction and on-field liability. He sulked and moped. He pointed fingers. The franchise caved to most, if not all, of his demands: coaching hires, the structure of the offense, questionable free-agent signings, trades and unexcused absences. By the end, the headache was no longer worth the production. His final meeting with new Jets coach Aaron Glenn was quick, cold and combative,according to Rodgers. Given Fields’ first start, Glenn is probably happy with his call.It remains to be seen if Rodgers can hold up to the rigors of a 17-game regular season and the promise of the playoffs – or if the honeymoon phase will wear off. But there are few things in sport as intoxicating as seeing the old guy who still has it. At least for four quarters, Rodgers showed that it is foolish to bet against a Hall of Famer having one great season left in him.MVP of the weekView image in fullscreenNot bad at all, Josh. Not bad at all.Photograph: Jeffrey T Barnes/APJosh Allen, QB, Buffalo Bills.So … that was intense. There were moments during the Bills’ 41-40 instant classic victory over the Ravens when Allen looked like the greatest player of all time. There were moments when Lamar Jackson looked like the greatest player of all time. There were moments when Derrick Henry looked like the greatest player of all time (until his fourth-quarter fumble that changed the momentum of the game). And when 41-year-old Matt Prater, who wasn’t even on the Bills a few weeks ago, kicked the winning field in the final seconds, there were plenty in Buffalo who would have swornhewas the greatest player of all time. But Allen gets the plaudits for leading his team back from 15 points down in the four minutes – his final line for the evening included 394 passing yards, two passing touchdowns and two rushing touchdowns – displaying a compelling blend of calm, physicality and football smarts.“Our team doesn’t quit,” Allen told NBC in a post-game interview. “There’s people that left the stadium. And that’s OK, we’ll be fine. But have some faith next time.”Consider yourself told.Stat of the weekView image in fullscreenDaniel Jones: Indianapolis’s new hero.Photograph: AJ Mast/APThe Colts won a Week 1 game for the first time since 2013.Welcome to the Danny Dimes era, Indianapolis. The Colts clubbed the Dolphins 33-8 to open the season, with Daniel Jones becoming just the fifth quarterback inNFLhistory to throw for 250-plus yards and run for two or more touchdowns in a season opener. Jones also became the first quarterback to lead a scoring drive onevery single possessionin a single game,according to NFL Research. That’s right! Jones, in his first week as the Colts starter, put together a performance unmatched by Patrick Mahomes, Tom Brady, Joe Montana, Nathan Peterman or … anyone.Jones dismantled a dismal Dolphins defense, playing with a confidence he has rarely displayed since his rookie season. In New York, Jones became tentative, falling apart under pressure and chasing checkdowns rather than attacking defenses down the field. In his debut for the Colts, Jones drilled throws to all levels, completing 10 of his 13 attempts for 160 yards and a touchdown outside the numbers. In the red zone, he showed off his wheels and toughness, extending plays and scoring on two quarterback sneaks. He won’t face Miami every week, but Jones showed he can be a viable starter in Shane Steichen’s system.Video of the weekDid we get a catch of the year contender in garbage time of week one? You bet.Totally insane by Isaac TeSlaa.pic.twitter.com/vzjuU7FtrF— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero)September 7, 2025There’s Lions rookie Isaac TeSlaa, offering up his best Odell Beckham impression in a blowout 27-13 defeat to the Packers. The Lions have plenty of questions swirling around them after a heavy defeat. But TeSlaa is not one of them; he is an immediate star.Elsewhere around the league …View image in fullscreenMicah Parsons had a strong debut for the Packers.Photograph: Mike Roemer/AP-- The Micah Parsons era in Green Bay has begun. Ten days after being traded by the Cowboys, Parsons was on the field for the Packers, terrorizing the Lions. Dealing with a back injury, Parsons played fewer than 50% of Green Bay’s defensive snaps. But his impact was immediate, commanding the attention of the Lions’ offensive line and allowing the rest of the Packers’ defense to feast. Parsons finished the game with three pressures. The results of those pressures: a two-yard loss on a completion, an interception and his first sack as a Packer.-- It may be time for Mike McDaniel to go condo shopping. Expectations for the Dolphins were low this season, but their performance against the Colts in the opener was putrid. Miami looked unprepared, undisciplined, and overmatched in their loss to the Colts. The franchise has poured a ton of resources into its defensive front, which couldn’t sniff Jones on Sunday. The secondary, an afterthought all offseason, confirmed itself as theweakest groupin the league. And that’s before you get to the offense, McDaniel’s speciality, which was a disjointed mess. It’s one week, but everything is already on the table in Miami: McDaniel’s job, Tua Tagovailoa’s starting role, and Tyreek Hill’s future.-- The Bengals have made a habit of stumbling out of the gate under Zac Taylor, and this year was no exception. Cincinnati edged past Cleveland 17-16 on Sunday, but only thanks to the assistance of rookie Browns kicker Andre Szmyt. Joe Burrow and the Bengals’ offense struggled to find rhythm, eking out just seven yards of offense in the second half. Yet the Browns couldn’t capitalise. Szmyt missed two big kicks on his NFL debut, including a 36-yarder that would have given Cleveland the lead late in the fourth quarter.-- If you had Jake Tonges deciding a critical division game in Week 1, congratulations. Tonges, a third-string tight end and career special teamer, entered Sunday with zero career receptions. But he caught the game-winning touchdown against the Seahawks in a 17-13 win for the 49ers, replacing the injured George Kittle.Purdy making magic happen 🪄Jake Tonges with the hands 🙌📺: FOXNFL+ //https://t.co/KTh0i4oaLhpic.twitter.com/26IBNBe9MT— San Francisco 49ers (@49ers)September 7, 2025Brock Purdy had a brutalseasonopener for San Francisco, throwing two interceptions and almost coughing up a couple more. But when the Niners needed Purdy to deliver most, he did. On third down, he scrambled around and threw a jump ball to Tonges, who snagged the ball before Riq Woolen could pick it off.-- We have a fun quarterback rivalry brewing in the NFC South. Baker Mayfield and Michael Penix Jr exchanged clutch drives in the Bucs’ 23-20 win over the Falcons. Penix, making just his fourth career start, led his third fourth-quarter go-ahead drive, capping it with agravity-defying rushing touchdownto put the Falcons ahead with 2:17 remaining. But Mayfield had the last word, finding rookie receiver Emeka Egbuka for his second touchdown of the day with 59 seconds left. Tampa missed the extra point, handing Atlanta one last chance, and Penix drove the Falcons into field-goal range. But Younghoe Koo pushed his kick wide, and the Bucs escaped with the win.Penix was again denied an early career-defining performance by his defense and special teams. But the small sample size is growing larger each week; Penix has the tools to be a franchise quarterback. “I told him after the game, he’s going to be a problem in this league for a long time,” Mayfield said of Penix post-game. “I think he’s a great player. He’s young, but he’s got it.”-- He may not act it, but Pete Carroll became the oldest head coach in NFL history on Sunday. At 73 years and 357 days, in his debut with the Raiders, Carroll oversaw a 20-13 win over the Patriots. The win also made Carroll the first coach to win his debut with four different franchises. Vegas struggled to run the ball and had multiple coverage breakdowns on defense, the antithesis of everything Carroll preaches. The good news: the Raiders may have the most explosive passing game in the league. Geno Smith threw for 362 yards and a touchdown with one interception, averaging 10.6 yards per attempt in his Raiders debut. Smith spread the ball around to eight different receivers, four of whom averaged more than 20 yards a catch.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsAaron RodgersPittsburgh SteelersNew York JetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In this huge success that the whole world saw, he promoted Greece,” Marinakis said when presenting him with an award in Greece following his Europa League triumph.“We must thank him especially for this and we wish him well, although we are sure that he will do well as he has the ability. Wherever he goes, the successes will come.”Having led the club into Europe, Nuno departs the City Ground as the club’s most successful manager since Frank Clark, and they sit 10th in the Premier League table.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestnewsShareReuse this content"

Rather than dwelling on the pain oflosing his US Open titleand No 1 ranking, he was thinking about the future.Sinner felt his game was too predictable, even one-dimensional, compared with Alcaraz, whose deep toolbox of shots left him uncomfortable and unable to find rhythm on the court. As a result of that discomfort, Sinner made a decision. The 24-year-old resolved to make significant changes to his game in pursuit of becoming a better, more complete tennis player and keeping up with his rival, even if he might suffer in the short term.Carlos Alcaraz savours ‘best tournament’ of his career after claiming second US Open titleRead more“I’m going to aim to maybe even lose some matches from now on, but trying to do some changes trying to be a bit more unpredictable,” Sinner said. “Because I think that’s what I have to do, trying to become a better player.”It was a remarkable admission, particularly considering Sinner’s own dominance in recent years. Over the past 52 weeks, the Italian holds a 51-1 record against opponents not named Alcaraz and is 74-1 against everyone but Alcaraz on hard courts since November 2023. He has spent the past two years destroying opponents, compiling 65 consecutive weeks at No 1. However, Alcaraz has now won seven of their past eight meetings. Only one player has forced him to make those changes.This is firstly a reflection of his Spanish opponent’s greatness, already one of the best players in the game’s history, whose career continues to move at a historic pace. Hisfirst grand slam title at the US Openestablished him as the first teenage ATP No 1 in history, and now with his second success in New York he is the second‑youngest man to win six majors. At 22, he is also the fourth man to win multiple major titles on all three surfaces. He still has so much room for improvement.Unlike most of his other triumphs, there were no rollercoaster battles against lesser opponents or seemingly impossible comebacks against his toughest adversaries. He simply performed at a supreme level throughout the tournament, dropping his only set of the fortnight to Sinner. He was sublime in the final, letting rip with his forehand, which dictated the baseline exchanges throughout.His peerless defensive abilities made the court feel so small for Sinner and, as the losing finalist admitted, his variety of shot just makes the Italian uncomfortable. “I feel I can do everything on court, to be honest: slices, drop shots, topspin, flat,” Alcaraz said.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz with his team and family after defeating Jannik Sinner in New York.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty ImagesOne of the most significant factors in his success was his serve. For a long time, Alcaraz’s serve was the one ordinary part of his game. It was imprecise and inconsistent, particularly on important points, making it vulnerable against the best players. Alcaraz won his first US Open in spite of his serve, conceding 24 service games throughout the tournament. This time, he lost his serve just three times. Since 1991, only Pete Sampras at Wimbledon in 1997 has conceded fewer service games en route to a major title. It provided him with a platform for the rest of his game to flow and is a terrifying development for future opponents.Sinner’s response to his defeat also showed why these two players will continue to tower over the rest of the tour for years to come. Although he did not feel he needed to make such significant changes to his playing style, Alcaraz’s reaction tolosing against the Italian at Wimbledonwas similar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As was the case with Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic before them, their increasingly frequent battles will mould them into better players as long as they are both at the top of the game. There is no room for complacency.Although they had already split the previous five grand slams between them, ahead of the French Open, Alcaraz and Sinner had never faced each other in a major final. They have now become the first men in history tocontest three major finals in a calendar year. By New York, the prospect of a final between them felt inevitable, as if nothing but a freak injury or occurrence could stop it.Many things can happen in the future, but as things stand the gap is widening and for the rest of the players hoping to one day lift the biggest trophies in the sport, life is only becoming more complicated.Explore more on these topicsTennisJannik SinnerCarlos AlcarazUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Suárez was at the center of the confrontation, first putting Sounders midfielder Obed Vargas in a headlock before being dragged away. Later, TV cameras caught Suárezyelling at, and spitting on, Sounders security director Gene Ramirez.Sounders team psychologist Steven Lenhart, himself a former MLS player who was known for confrontations and physical play, has also had his credential revoked for the remainder of the 2025 season. Lenhart was among a large group of Sounders players and staff who joined the melee along withInter Miamiplayers and staff.Notably, Inter Miami midfielder Sergio Busquets escaped punishment, despite cameras showing him raising his hand to Vargas’ face, which escalated the fracas along with Suárez’s actions.The ban means Suárez will miss Miami’s upcoming games at Charlotte FC on 13 September, at home in a rematch against the Sounders three days later, and another home game against DC United on 20 September.The Bundesliga’s deal with Mark Goldbridge is odd, and exactly what MLS is missing with AppleRead moreTogether, the suspensions fromMLSare far less severe than those meted out by the Leagues Cup itself, which has its own disciplinary process and committee despite it being co-run by MLS. The Leagues Cup suspended Suárez for six games, Busquets for two, Lenhart for five, with an additional three-game ban for Miami defender Tomás Áviles.It is entirely possible that, given the ages of Suárez (38) and Busquets (37) and the fact that both players’ contracts are up at the end of this season, neither will be made to serve any of their Leagues Cup suspensions. The MLS suspensions, meanwhile, will keep Suárez out of three crucial games as Miami aim to improve their playoff seeding. As of now, the Herons sit sixth in the East, four points out of a spot that would get them home field advantage in the first round of the playoffs, and 10 points back of the Supporters’ Shield.Suárez’s ban is roughly in line with past MLS suspensions for spitting, though in every recent case the spitting action itself was isolated and took place during the course of play. Héctor Herrera was suspended two games for being caught on VAR spitting at a referee in the Houston Dynamo’s final game of last season, while Real Salt Lake’s Jasper Löffelsend was given a similar suspension for spitting in 2023.Suárez posted an apology on Instagram four days after the final, saying that “It was a moment of great tension and frustration, where right after the match things happened that shouldn’t have happened, but that doesn’t justify the reaction I had … I was wrong and I sincerely regret it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But his visit was always about distraction, even if it exposed his flawsAndrew Lawrenceat Flushing MeadowsMon 8 Sep 2025 09.21 EDTLast modified on Mon 8 Sep 2025 15.16 EDTShareIt was just the authoritarian image Donald Trump hoped to project at the US Open: the president himself, looming from Arthur Ashe Stadium’s giant screens like Chairman Mao at Tiananmen Gate, as he stood at attention for the national anthem. But there was no denying that, while the picture was there, the sound clashed. The burst of cheers that went up for his stiff salute on Sunday was quicklydrowned out by a chorus of boosmade louder from the Ashe roof being closed for rain – perhaps fitting given that many fans had been left to stand in the wet and endure the long security lines that resulted from his attendance. In that awkward five-second moment, as the Stars and Stripes was unfurled on center court, the president smirked at the negative reaction. It surely rang so familiar.Trump’s presence at the US Open men’s final wasn’t just intended as a soft power grab, the kind of routine stunt Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un and the other despots he admires pull all the time at sports events – except with recruitment ads for Ice playing across the US. No, Trump’s presence was intended as a distraction. Not a distraction for him; lord knows, he couldn’t care less about the actual match, a fact that was reinforced when Trump left his luxury box seat to step inside and kibitz with a phalanx of suck-ups. No, Trump’s visit was dropped like a flash bang to divert attention fromklaxoning recession indicators,rumbling speculation about his healthand, naturally, those files about that guywhose name must not be mentioned.If Trump was motivated by a patriotic love for tennis, he would have rocked up a day earlier forthe women’s final. But for Trump the prospect of cheering on Jersey girl Amanda Anisimova and her epic comeback story clearly wasn’t juicy enough, much less the idea of actuallysharingthe spotlight with an American player. So Sunday’s match-up between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz was retrofitted for Trump’s calliope Maga stage. Before the tilt Alcaraz, a Spaniard, was asked about playing in front of the president, and stepped right into the trap. “For me, playing in front of him, I don’t want myself to be nervous,” he said, not realizing his words would soon become fodder forFox and Friends. “I think it’s great for tennis to have the president into the final.”The USTA’s censorship of Trump dissent at the US Open is cowardly, hypocritical and un-American | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreFormer presidents have shown that you can appear at a US Open without making it about ego: the Obamas were clearly caught up in supporting a US playerwhen they watched Frances Tiafoe battle Alcarazin the 2022 semi-final. Bill Clinton was proudly Team USA, too. In 2000, in his final weeks as president, he broke away from the UN Millennium Summit for Pete Sampras’s semi-final against Lleyton Hewitt, joining John McEnroe in the commentary box and signing balls fans lobbed up to him as Secret Service minders looked on and snipers lined the stadium upper deck. Clinton also visited Sampras in the locker room after the loss to Hewitt, which postponed the American’s epic quest for a then-record 14th grand slam. In 2009 Clinton returned and gave the keynote speech for Arthur Ashe’s induction into the US Open’s Court of Champions. He remembered Ashe’s triumphs over segregation, apartheid and his efforts to open his sport up to under-resourced and represented communities.Trump’s presence on Sunday – under the Ashe stadium marquee, on grounds named for gender and LGBTQ+ pioneer Billie Jean King, at a tournament that makes a point of touting its unwavering commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion – didn’t just strike a marked contrast. It broke from the markedly lower profiles of past presidents and was over-the-top, even for a sport that regularly hosts royal families. But Trump simply couldn’t pass up the optics. Getting booed by a multicultural east coast crowd that laps up$23 cocktails and $100 caviar-dolloped chicken nuggetswithout irony is red meat his base would devour. And getting that last laugh would make for satisfying personal revenge, an urgent second-term theme.For 40 years Trump exploited the US Open for clout, calling attention to himself, his luxury box perch and all the bold-faced names who joined him inside. But the New York crowd – the heart of the Open – never cottoned to his faux-gold flash and didn’t hesitate to jeer his big screen pop-ups even then. After the golden escalator ride to kick off his 2015 presidential campaign and the fiery announcement speech hitting out at immigrants and foreigners, he effectively became spectator non-grata in Flushing. Months later he attended the US Open quarter-final between Venus and Serena Williams and heard more boos as he slunk away with Melania, out of the stadium’s “President’s Gate”. So it meant something for him on Sunday to be back 10 years later, at the same event that was once the crown jewel of CBS and a lead-in for 60 Minutes – two more institutionshe is determined to get even with– and back in the hometownhe has repeatedly threatened to invade. That is, when he’s not outrightdeclaring war on Chicago.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump appears on the jumbotron during the US Open final.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesBefore Trump’s arrival in his native borough of Queens, as foot soldiers from homeland security and other federal agencies swept the US Open campus, the USTA seemed as if it might do more to accommodate him than Rolex CEO Jean-Frederic Dufour – whohad reportedly invited the presidentto the company’s luxury suite in hopes of catching a break on US tariffs imposed on Switzerland. No doubt Trump would have sat in the umpire’s chair if that were an option. The day before the men’s final, news broke that the USTA had issued a memo to broadcasters urging them to avoid showing any dissent against Trump ina craven display of anticipatory obediencethat the federation cowardly justified in an 11-word statement. (We thought the former reality show host was supposed to be againstunfair editing…) In the moments Trump actually seemed to be paying attention to Sunday’s match, he didn’t really cheer or applaud – which is weird but not surprising. He had made the day about himself, after all.And yet: just when it seemed as if the USTA couldn’t bow down any lower, intentionally or not, it may have pulled off a canny rope-a-dope. Perhaps mindful of the president’s avarice forstolen valor, they set the US Open men’s trophy inside the Rolex box for Trump’s arrival, and then switched it for a doubles cup after the anthem. Breaking with its own edict, the USTA not only showed Trump on the big screen again during the changeover between the first and second sets, it pushed in and held the shot for 20 seconds. The crowd, much larger this time, booed him so long and lustily that it was hard not to be reminded of theharsh reception to Trump at the 2019 World Series. Later on Sunday, the camera cut to noted Trump bugbear Bruce Springsteen – triggering a roar of approval that nearly blew the Ashe roof off.Unlike Fifa at July’s Club World Cup final, the USTA ensured Trump’s Rolex perch became a prison by the end of the match, so Alcaraz could keep up the winner’s tradition of climbing into the crowd to embrace their support team. Trump could only watch, like a kid on punishment seeing his friends play outside, as someone other than him presented the trophy to Alcaraz – because, well, he’s no competition for Ivan Lendl and much better men than Trump have tried taking trophies from the former No 1. After the pomp and circumstance, Trump was gone – back on the road within minutes of match point and in the air not long thereafter, according to the White House pool report. The outsized security presence that turned Sunday’s showcase into an authoritarian spectacle disappeared in his wake, too. For many fans who had suffered through it all, his departure was more cause for celebration.Theodore Roosevelt’s daughter, Alice, once said of her father that “he wants to be the bride at every wedding, the corpse at every funeral, and the baby at every christening.” But the line fits Trump even better. As long as there is attention to be had, you can bet he’ll find a way to make himself the center of it and make sport of self-aggrandizement, regardless of who, or what, he may trample over on his march.This article was amended on 8 September 2025. We originally identified Alice Roosevelt Longworth’s father as Franklin Delano Roosevelt. She was, in fact, the daughter of Theodore Roosevelt.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisUS sportsTennisDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s true, of course: they’ve been in the final of the last two Euros, played well in getting to the quarter-final of the last World Cup and have a fleet of extremely gifted players but have not really impressed since beating Greece in the Nations League under Lee Carsley last November.What’s never considered, though, is the thought that they may not get to the 2026 World Cup at all.England travel to face Serbia on Tuesday, having won four out of four without conceding a goal. But three of those four games have been at home and two of them have been against Andorra. They still have to go not only to Belgrade but also to Tirana to face Albania. Serbia could only draw away there, which offers a little breathing space, but were England to lose on Tuesday, they would be under pressure. The home game against Serbia in November could end up as a shootout for who takes the group’s sole automatic qualification slot and who is forced into the playoffs. It’s a jeopardy to which England as a whole, having not missed out on a World Cup since the last one staged in the USA, in 1994, have perhaps not quite adjusted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is not 1978 when there were only 16 qualifiers and England and Italy faced off in a four-team qualifying group with only one to make it to Argentina. It’s not even like 1994, a 24-team tournament, when England were grouped with the Netherlands, a very good Norway and a decent Poland, plus Turkey and San Marino, with two qualifying from that cohort. Even after expansion to 32 sides, England found themselves in groups with Italy (for 1998) and Germany (for 2002), with one to qualify directly and the other to face a playoff. The current qualification group with Serbia, Albania, Latvia and Andorra was potentially awkward rather than daunting.And yet England are not the only side with a reasonable chance of winning the tournament facing up to the fact that their presence in North America next summer may not be a fait accompli. South American qualifying is as good as done – that 10-team megagroup is now a flawed splurge of largely meaningless content when there are six qualifiers and a playoff spot on offer. Brazil had a real wobble in autumn 2023, losing three games in a row, yet still qualified with ease. All that remains to be settled there is whether Venezuela or Bolivia will take the playoff spot. New Zealand predictably took the Oceanian slot. The usual suspects – Japan, South Korea, Iran and Australia – have qualified from Asia, but so too have the first-timers Jordan and Uzbekistan, with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iraq, Oman and Indonesia to contest the final three places.It’s in Europe and Africa, though, where perceived giants could be in trouble. Morocco, semi-finalists in 2022, have already secured their place. Senegal, though, trail DR Congo by a point with three games to go and face a monumental game in Kinshasa on Tuesday. Lose that and, if they finish as one the best four (of nine) runners-up, they will play off for the right to be Africa’s representative in the intercontinental playoffs (two qualifiers from six). Cameroon, similarly, are a point behind Cape Verde, whom they face in Praia on Tuesday. Nigeria are in an even worse position. They kept hopes alive with an unconvincing 1-0 win over Rwanda on Saturday but lie behind both South Africa and Benin, both of whom they have still to play, in their group.Messi scores in home farewell for Argentina and remains tight-lipped on World CupRead moreEurope’s qualifying is not so far advanced and the picture less clear, but Germany’s 2-0 defeat in Slovakia on Thursday added a frisson of anxiety. A home victory over Northern Ireland was necessary but far from comfortable; next month’s game in Belfast looks unexpectedly critical. Belgium’s draw away to North Macedonia in June has them looking anxiously at next month’s game away to Wales, even after comfortable wins this month over Liechtenstein and Kazakhstan.But it’s Italy, four-time world champions, who, having missed out in 2018 and 2022, are in the biggest trouble. They were beaten 3-0 away to a Norway side finally beginning to play to the level of their best individuals in June and, after drawing 0-0 at home after 45 minutes to Estonia on Friday, there seemed a possibility they might not even take the playoff slot. Five second-half goals changed the mood, but Monday’s fixture against Israel (to be played in Debrecen, Hungary) represents a major test. Lose that, and although they’d have a game in hand, they’d be six points off second.Even with 48 teams qualifying, in Europe and Africa, World Cup qualification cannot be taken for granted.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

The football has been uninspired at times – England underwhelmed in attack during their2-0 victory over Andorraat Villa Park last Saturday – but Tuchel believes facing Serbia in a ferocious atmosphere can ignite his reign.“It is always the opportunity and I’ll always see it like this,” the German said. “This game is the opportunity and I think it will bring out the best in us that we are here in Belgrade.”Harry Kane and Tuchel both mentioned the intimidating nature of the tunnel, which is the longest in Europe at 240 metres. “The tunnel is not so agreeable,” Tuchel said. “But that’s what it’s all about now. It’s nice, you’re in this country, this sporting nation, full of emotional people, full of quality in every sport – especially in sports that have a ball.“They are so talented and determined. That’s the beauty of it and if you want to go to a World Cup and to play for the national team, experiencing this is the beauty. Tomorrow is one of these nights. And we’re up for it.”England, who top the group by five points, are missing a host of key players and are short on experience. There could be anotherstart in midfield for Elliot Anderson, who impressed on hisdebutagainst Andorra, while Morgan Rogers, Tino Livramento, Morgan Gibbs-White and Myles Lewis-Skelly do not have many caps between them. Yet Tuchel, who said that Marc Guéhi has shaken off the groin issue that forced him off against Andorra, believes his players will rise to the occasion.“Afraid of nothing,” Tuchel said. “The group was excellent throughout the week and everyone deserves to play. It is good, we have some difficult choices and some narrow decisions to make. We will have a strong bench and age is not decisive.”Tuchel hopes that Jordan Henderson can play a vital leadership role even if the veteran midfielder is not in the starting lineup. “Jordan has played here, Harry [Kane] has played here and they have talked already about it,” he said. “The spectators will be emotional, they will be loud.”View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel is missing a host of key players for the match against Serbia.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APThe expectation is that England will face another deep five-man defence. Tuchel is working on creative solutions. He is without Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka but believes that their replacements will not be weighed down by anxiety.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think it has been an excellent camp with an excellent group. They are all very confident and eager to play.”This is England’s first trip to Belgrade since facing the old Yugoslavia in 1987. Tuchel’s players have held a meeting about the possibility of racist abuse from the crowd. The stadium’s capacity has been reduced by 15% because of fan behaviour whenSerbiafaced Andorra in June.Branko Radujko, general secretary of the Football Association of Serbia, has used his programme notes to urge spectators not to spoil tonight’s occasion.“In addition to the spectacle we expect on the pitch, let me draw attention to something just as important: behaviour of all of us in the stands,” he said. “This match of truth also carries great responsibility.“We are still under special monitoring of Uefa. Every inappropriate reaction, insult or incident could cost us dearly on our path to the USA, Mexico and Canada, including the possibility of having to play a decisive match with Albania behind closed doors.“That is the reason I sincerely and seriously call on you: let us cheer from the heart but let it be fair. We can be loud but dignified. Let our support be a source of strength, not a risk for the national team.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelHarry KaneSerbiaWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersnewsShareReuse this content"

Job done on that front, with four points out of six a wholly acceptable return. The visit of Greece to Hampden Park next month is hugely significant.The stodginess of Scotland’s display before Ché Adams nudged them in front against Belarus ultimately proved irrelevant. Belarus lacked the nous and guile to inflict a bloody nose on Scotland. Still, recent struggles against packed defences meant nobody of Scottish persuasion could rest entirely easy until a 65th-minute own goal was added to the Adams effort. Greek success and acomfortable one in Glasgowin March serves as a warning. Still, the Scots would have readily taken this position and opportunity before a Group C ball was kicked. Back-to-back clean sheets to start the campaign bodes well. This looks like a robust, well-drilled team once again.Belarus 0-2 Scotland: World Cup 2026 qualifying Group C – live reactionRead more“It is a good start but it is only a start,” said theScotlandmanager Steve Clarke. “Four points will never qualify anybody for anything. It is nice to go home with smiles on our faces but I am already thinking about next month.”Scotland’s showing during thescoreless draw in Copenhagenon Friday, coupled with Belarus’s 5-1 thrashing at the hands of Greece, placed the Tartan Army in that historically dangerous position of holding great expectation. Deepest Hungary and a closed doors scenario conjured memories of Covid times, during which Scotland qualified for their first tournament since 1998. The wait for a World Cup appearance, though, stretches back to that very year.In accordance with the variation in task, Clarke freshened up his team. Ben Gannon-Doak was one of four changes to the Scottish starting XI as Clarke sought increased cutting edge.Belarusswitched eight as they sought to improve on a record of just three wins in 28 World Cup qualifiers.The first quarter of the game was so hectic as to belie the lack of atmosphere. Gannon-Doak in combination with Andy Robertson carried Scotland’s main threat on the left side.The Scotland manager looked rightly irritated, however, that his team was not creating clearcut opportunities. Max Johnston broke that mould with a cross poked wide by Scott McTominay in the 29th minute. McTominay soon screamed in vain for a penalty; Yegor Parkhomenko’s unpunished challenge occurred outside the box in any case.View image in fullscreenZakhar Volkov heads past his own goalkeeper to double Scotland’s lead.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAAngus Gunn spared his Scotland teammates red faces before the interval. Johnston, whose defensive attributes are open to question, simply stopped in allowing Max Ebong to maraud through on goal. Gunn saved with his feet at his near post from the Astana man. The Scots heeded the warning. Billy Gilmour responded with a long-range attempt that Fedor Lapoukhov fumbled on to the woodwork. A terrific John McGinn cross found the head of McTominay, who placed the ball on a plate for Adams. The 29-year-old notched his 10th Scotland goal from all of three yards. Two minutes before the break, Scotland had their crucial advantage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead – and incredibly – the referee issued only a yellow card to Vladislav Kalinin for a wild lunge on Lewis Ferguson. Equally incomprehensible was the failure of the video assistant referee to at least send Nikola Dabanovic towards a monitor. Even before modern day sanitisation of tackling, this was a sending-off offence. McTominay should have diminished the significance of the incident but sent a free header straight into Lapoukhov’s hands from 12 yards.Just when it seemed the biggest threat to Scotland was their own impatience, their lead was doubled. This was the strangest of things, a fine team goal converted by an opponent. Robertson fed Gilmour, who played inside to Adams. Gilmour’s run in breaking from midfield was perfectly timed, allowing Adams to complete the one-two. Gilmour’s headed cross was bound for the head of McTominay, causing Zakhar Volkov to panic and nod beyond his own goalkeeper. Scotland had the leeway they craved and a two-goal margin the increasingly blunt Belarus side looked incapable of overhauling. Attention now turned towards Athens, where Denmark were swaggering to a surprising win.Adams should have claimed his second but delayed his angled shot, allowing Pavel Zabelin to clear from the goalline. A raft of substitutions had removed what little tempo there was in the fixture. Clarke had no reason to care about that. Hampden on 9 October should be quite the spectacle. Another win would send Scotland halfway towards their promised land.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersScotlandBelarusmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Swedes are third on one point, ahead of Slovenia on goal difference.

And they took the lead for the first time when Matteo Politano poked home on 58 minutes.

As part of the settlement Manchester City accepts that the current APT rules are valid and binding. It has been agreed that neither the Premier League nor the club will be making any further comment about the matter.”City claimed victory in aninitial battle over APTin October, after an arbitration panel found that certain aspects of the rules which then stood were discriminatory. Loans made by shareholders to their own club should have been included within APT rules, the panel adjudged, while there were also problems with the way in which clubs were given information on what might be “fair market value” in any given deal.After making adjustments to accommodate the panel’s ruling, the Premier League argued that any problems over APT had been resolved and its rulebook fit for purpose. City challenged the league’s adjustments, however, and begana new process of arbitrationthis year. It is this second process which has now been resolved. Both parties, however, remain involved in the lengthy and secretive disciplinary process in which the club have been hit with more than130 charges of breaking the Premier League’s rulebook.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Bellamy, who was assistant manager to Vincent Kompany in the top flight at Burnley, was asked whether he had detected a recent shift in styles.Bellamy said: “I think the physicality is clear and it has been for a few years … It has become a running game. It has become beyond extreme with the physical capabilities. We found it with Burnley – we built a Championship team that could come out of small spaces. Then go to the Premier League: cyborgs, that’s what you’re up against. It was unreal. They just run you but also have ridiculous ability … that’s why you pay £80m for that type of profile. Then you look around the team and see £40m, £50m, £60m [players].”Wales host Canada, coached by the former Leeds manager Jesse Marsch, in Swansea. Bellamy said of selecting challenging opposition: “I was like: ‘Give me the toughest.’ Look, I’m fully aware I could get beaten and – can I say this? – get my ass kicked but what would I gain from playing a lesser team, where we know where we are? This is a tough game. We’ll see where we are. It gives us a good opportunity to be able to get better.”Bellamy hopes the Canada match, the first men’s home game to be held in Swansea since November 2020 and outside Cardiff since July 2023, will be a sell-out. “I believe national teams, countries like us, should be playing in front of full stadiums,” he said. “I might be pushing it, but I expect that.”Bellamy was informed that as of Monday afternoon the Football Association of Wales had sold about 15,000 tickets. “So, we push again,” he said with a smile. “It’s not a meaningless friendly, [it is an] important game.”Explore more on these topicsFootballCraig BellamyWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Every. Single. Day,”Xavi Hernández once said, but nobody expected itinsidethe opposition’s penalty area. And yet here was Spain’s new generation,European champions like his, doing exactly what he demanded – “Pum-pum-pum-pum, always one touch” – just a few metres from Ugurcan Cakir’s goal. Which, when the whole perfect sequence finally played out in Konya, Turkey, is where the ball concluded its journey.The question now is where they will conclude their own. Can they, like Xavi’s generation, themost successfulin history, followthe European Championshipwith a World Cup? Watching them play on Sunday night, nine months before the tournament’s opening at the Azteca stadium, the answer can only be yes. Watching the second of the six goals they scored, especially.World Cup qualifying: Depay sets scoring record as Dutch survive scare in LithuaniaRead moreFor 75 secondsSpainhad the ball. Every player got it, taking 66 touches between them, the ball worked from one end to the other without Turkey getting any. Onlyworkeddoesn’t feel like quite the right word. A symphony, El País called it, which is what the sports daily AS called it too. Marca said to hang it in the Prado. When Pedri played it to Marc Cucurella on the left of the box, his ball, delivered first time, found Nico Williams inside the area. One touch in to Mikel Oyarzabal. One touch in to Mikel Merino. One touch in to the net.Pum-pum-pum-pum, and Spain were 2-0 up.They had been playing 21 minutes. Spain led inside six when Pedri dropped the shoulder, glided past Hakan Calhanoglu and guided a shot into the corner. And that had been coming: Cakir had made two superb saves already. Spain had taken five shots on target by the time they got the second; by the end, they had scored six, could have got 10, and they had called it a night on the hour, something like perfection achieved already. Merino was waiting for his teammates to finish scrawling on the ball, Pedri had scored twice, Oyarzabal had three assists and Lamine Yamal two, the forwards providing for the midfielders.View image in fullscreenPedri scored twice in Spain’s victory over Turkey and is thriving in a deeper role.Photograph: Khalil Hamra/AP“For those of us who love football, it’s a joy to see them play; Spain have the qualities to emulate what they did between 2008 and 2012,” Turkey’s coach, Vincenzo Montella, said, and that was before the match. After it, everyone else was inclined to agree. Euphoria may not always be advisable, but it was unavoidable. “We thought we would never see anything like the Spain of Casillas, Xavi, Villa or Iniesta, but this generation that Luis de la Fuente leads appears ready to outdo what their colleagues did between 2008 and 2012,” Marca wrote. “It is impossible to escape the favourite’s tag ahead of next summer.”Victory in Turkey put Spain top of their qualifying group with two wins from two, nine scored and none conceded. But it wasn’t the fact that they won, it was how they did it, that it is no fluke, no one-off. It was their second-highest away victory – the previous was in Liechtenstein in 2017 – and the 27th competitive game without a defeat, statistically speaking:Portugal beat them on penaltiesin the Nations League. Before that, the last defeat wasin Scotland, at the start of De la Fuente’s reign, which hadseemed destinedto be brief. Instead, theywon the Nations Leaguein 2023 andthe European Championshipin 2024.Few had expectedsuccess then; now they do.There may never have been a better European champion side. Spain won all seven games and beat Italy, Germany, France and England en route to the title. When it was put to Morata pre-tournament that Spain no longer have the kind of players that can aspire to the Ballon d’Or, so they couldn’t really anticipate going much beyond the quarters, he insisted: “Rodri could easily have won it last year; all he lacks is marketing. I always tell him that. We have Pedri, who is different. And I’m sure Nico and Lamine will be there in the future.” When he left the Olympic Stadium in Berlin with the medal around his neck, there was a smile, a reminder: turns out the captain has an eye for a player.View image in fullscreenSpain’s Nations League triumph in 2023 was followed by glory at Euro 2024.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PARodridid win it.Dani Carvajalwas fourth.Fabián Ruiz, largely forgotten 18 months ago, is nominated this year. Lamine Yamal is a candidate. Euro 2024 showed they were good enough, a month changing everything, externally at least. Internally, they always believed, they said. Besides, there’s a fuel, too, in making fools of people; doubters drive you. “We might not have had ‘names’ but we were convinced we had players who were top three in the world, and we were clear that while there were teams withverygood individuals, as a group we were stronger,”Oyarzabal said.There was a guiding philosophy too, shared through generations. De la Fuente noted on Sunday night that he has known many of these players “since they were kids … and now they are superstars”. He has always said they are the best in the world; here, they looked like it, the level almost absurd, the football played ridiculous at times. “Incredible,” De la Fuente called it. “I’m very proud to manage a group like this, at professional and personal level. There is a model, an idea, that was established years ago in the federation and we’re continuing that. What we’re achieving now is the fruit of many years of work.”View image in fullscreenLamine Yamal’s progression shows no sign of slowing.Photograph: Khalil Hamra/APAnd yet there is an evolution, too:a depth, a variety, things that have changed for the better,seen in Berlinand beyond. If Spain’s second goal in Konya would have delighted Xavi, Spain’s ideologue, a defender of their footballing faith, it wasn’t all about that. That was evident in Germany last summer and in Turkey on Sunday night. Spain broke through too, unstoppable when up and running. Ferran Torres’s goal was born of a long ball.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If they didn’t have those qualities, it would be impossible. They interpret it perfectly.”If Euro 2024 showed they were good enough, there are elements that suggest an improvement since then. Lamine Yamal, a 16-year-old the night Spain reached the final,already doing outrageous things, is older. His progression shows no sign of slowing, the pressure seemingly somethinghe welcomes, with other dimensions added to his game, starting with ever greater responsibility. On Sunday night there were moments when it was less about fantasy, more about physique, opponents beaten by speed and strength, too.If he is not the best player in the world, perhaps a teammate is: there may be no one anywhere playing like Pedri. Over these two internationals, De la Fuente has played him in the deeper role Hansi Flick found for him and from where he dominates everything. Merino has effectively swapped with him: no, he is not about to become the No 9, but that shift has been good for him,new roles learned. And behind them Dean Huijsen, who made his debut in March, offers a range of passing and a willingness to step out of defence which is felt in every line. Carvajal and Rodri are still to return to their best after injury, and there is time. “This is a team that has an ability to improve and do things well that escape my imagination,” the coach said.Expectation is inevitable; it is also an extra pressure. It can carry the risk of relaxation too.Can winis notwill win; sometimes it is the opposite.Not here, they hope. “This generation is insatiable,” De la Fuente said. “We will be prudent, we know there is a lot to be done still. Football changes from one week to the next. But this group will never take its feet off the ground, you can rest assured on that.“We have the best footballers in the world, but we also choose good people. They know they have a chance of achieving very important things and they will never let that opportunity pass them by because of an excess of vanity, arrogance or anything like it.”Explore more on these topicsSpainWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last Thursday the executive chairman Daniel Levy wasrelieved of his rolein a shock announcement. Then on Sunday night Spurs said they had “unequivocally rejected” two expressions of interest in relation to buying the club.Daniel Levy was a loyal custodian of Spurs who knew his job was to protect the club | David PleatRead more“I can be really clear on this,” Venkatesham told Tottenham’s official channels on Monday. “The Lewis family are really clear. They see their involvement inTottenham Hotspurbeing long term and they see their involvement continuing through the generations.“We made a statement very late last night and a statement I hope was unambiguously clear that Tottenham Hotspur is not for sale.”On Sunday Tottenham laid out details of the expressions of interest, saying one had originated from PCP International Finance, the investment vehicle led by the former Newcastle shareholder Amanda Staveley. On Monday PCP confirmed it had been interested in a potential move but said “it does not intend to make an offer for Tottenham”. The second offer, according to Spurs, had been made by a consortium of investors “led by Dr Roger Kennedy and Wing-Fai Ng through Firehawk Holdings Limited”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He said the “next generation” of the Lewis family – Viv Lewis, alongside her brother Charlie and son-in-law Nick – would assume more prominence at the club. “The thing that ties them all together is their passion for Tottenham Hotspur and their ambition for the club moving forward,” he said.Hinting that the club were ready to spend more money in the transfer market, Venkatesham said the owners were keen to create a sense of stability. “I think it is very fair to say that we have firm backing from the Lewis family against our ambitions to be successful on the pitch, both on the men’s side and women’s side,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While the City goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita was down receiving treatment, head coach Andrée Jeglertz used his tactics board to show instructions to his players. Bompastor could be seen remonstrating with the officials at the time and, after the game, she said: “For me, that’s not fair. It’s not in the rules. I mentioned that last season as well, with all the goalkeepers going down just for the coach to have a tactical stoppage to talk to the players. I’m not saying I will never use that, because I know that it can be part of a strategy, but tonight it was too much. It was a long break, it was obvious for everyone, they had the board and everything.”Tom GarryMatch report:Chelsea 2-1 Manchester CityBeever-Jones shows she is more than impact playerSubs make difference for GunnersOlivia Smith may have stolen Arsenal hearts and the headlines with her stunning debut goal in the 4-1 defeat ofLondon City Lionesses, but the impact of the Gunners’ substitutes was key to them seeing out the game comfortably. For the third goal it was Beth Mead and Stina Blackstenius combining, before Frida Maanum was the beneficiary of that pair’s buildup play for Arsenal’s fourth. All three had come off the bench against the WSL newcomers and with Arsenal competing on four fronts this season, that quality in depth will be critical. The head coach Renée Slegers said of her squad: “It’s early in the season, so we also had to manage a lot of things. We had to make good decisions with yellow cards and players’ fitness today, and that’s all taken into account. The players who start the game problem-solved, they had to create a team connection and the rhythm on the pitch, and then the players that finished the game when things were more open – it was brilliant today.”Suzanne WrackMatch report:Arsenal 4-1 London City LionessesView image in fullscreenFrida Maanum completes the scoring as Arsenal roared back from a goal down at the Emirates.Photograph: Alex Burstow/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesToone scores emotional goalElla Toone started the season where she left off in Switzerland, with an attacking performance that illustrated how she continues to return to her best after a difficult 12 months. It was perhaps inevitable that she would score on the anniversary of her father Nick’s death, adding extra emotion to her 13th-minute opener against Leicester. Toone was integral to Manchester United’s dominant 4-0 victory against disjointed opponents, pulling the strings in behind Elisabeth Terland and providing the assist for Melvine Malard’s second goal. Toone registered 100 touches on the ball, the second-highest of anyone on the pitch and could have had a hat-trick. It was a routine opening-day win for Marc Skinner’s side, who showed the benefits of having already played competitive football this season in Champions League qualification.Sophie DowneyEverton hot-shot Vignola stuns AnfieldStanding in the mixed zone holding the match ball, even Ornella Vignola seemed a little bemused by what had just happened. One thing’s for certain: the smile will not be leaving her face any time soon. The 20-year-old announced herself in style after her move from Granada this summer, becoming the first Everton player to score a hat-trick in a Merseyside derby for 94 years. “She was superb and she has been like that in training,” her delighted manager, Brian Sørensen, said. “Her runs are so well-timed and the way she faces up and goes at players, she is excellent. She just wants to score.” The Blues cemented their dominance in this fixture with a 4-1 comeback victory, their fourth straight win against Liverpool and their sixth from six at Anfield.SDMatch report:Liverpool 1-4 Evertonskip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Spurs are delighted that the Japan centre-back chose to join them from Feyenoord this summer amid interest from Champions League sides. The new Tottenham head coach, Martin Ho, believes Koga can be a star. “For a 19-year-old she’s very mature. She’s well above her years in terms of football and personally,” Ho said. “That’s just a snippet of what Toko can do. We’ve only been working with her for the last five or six weeks and I think, when you get six or seven months in, you’re going to see a real, talented player, and I believe probably one of the best in world football.”TGMatch report:Tottenham 1-0 West HamVilla keep Agyemang quiet“I’m proud because it is difficult to play a nice first game,” the Aston Villa manager, Natalia Arroyo, said after her side earned a point away to Brighton. This felt like a typical opening day fixture: a goalless draw between two sides who were separated by just three points last season. Both sides looked refreshed but lacked cohesion in a game that promised much but delivered little. The Seagulls will be the most disappointed with the outcome: Dario Vidosic’s team controlled possession, led in attacking statistics and made twice as many passes as their opponents, who defended resolutely. Finding that clinical edge will be the next step for Brighton: Michelle Agyemang, back on loan from Arsenal after a career-changing summer, led the line and hit the post but was otherwise marshalled well by the visitors.SDExplore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballArsenal WomenManchester United WomenEverton WomenChelsea WomenTottenham Hotspur WomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With United again not in the Champions League, squad members will not receive the 25% salary increase that comes with participation in that competition.Onana had been told in the summer that he would stay at United. His deal, worth about £100,000 a week, expires in June 2027 and in discussions regarding potential new terms it was indicated a fresh contract may not be forthcoming.Club sources said after Lammens signed that they were at ease regarding having four goalkeepers and pointed to the expectation that Onana will be part of Cameroon’s squad for the Africa Cup of Nations and so unavailable for up to six weeks.

Only at Melbourne 1956 did the country win more.The AustralianAthleticschief executive, Simon Hollingsworth, said this event – and the World Para Athletics Championships starting in India later this month – promise to showcase Australia’s current podium contenders as well as those who will be there in Brisbane in 2032.“Both of the teams comprise seasoned champions as well as the next generation of athletes coming through,” Hollingsworth said, mentioning Paris medallists including Hull, Denny andhigh jumper Nicola Olyslagerswho justwon a Diamond League crown.View image in fullscreenJessica Hull remains among the leading contenders in middle-distance athletics events.Photograph: Michael Buholzer/APAnd then there is themagnetic draw of Gout.“We’ve got this exciting crop of people, including, of course, Gout, who’s making his senior debut in the 200 metres,” Hollingsworth said.“You look across the cohort and it’s exciting for what they’ll do right now in Tokyo, but also what that potential represents over the period leading into LA and then beyond.”SBS has shown 10 athletics world championships going back to 2001, including the past three, while the two before those were only available on Foxtel via Eurosport. Channel Seven screened the Australian championships and major meets over summer.The decision by Channel Nine – which will also show the 2028 and 2032 Olympics – to acquire the rights to the world championships in Tokyo underscores the high level of interest in the sport.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has recruited McAvaney to lead coverage across their linear channels and SBS On Demand platform alongside former Olympian Tamsyn Manou (nee Lewis).Some will say Tokyo’s convenient time zone for Australian audiences – the Japanese capital is an hour behind Sydney and Melbourne – has been the main cause for the additional interest from local broadcasters.Gout Gout headlines record Australian athletics squad for world championshipsRead moreHollingsworth argues that the deals also mean the two rights-holders both view athletics as a powerful property for prime time.“They’ve looked at what’s available and they’ve gone, ‘yes, this is something we think that people want to watch’, and that certainly backs up our experience over the summer,” he said, highlighting “really significant growth” in audiences on Channel Seven over summer.The timing will enhance the exposure of this crop of athletes, who spend much of their year racing in Europe during the Australian dead of night. That promises better commercial opportunities, as well as fewer early mornings for family and friends hoping to tune in.“It’s hard when we’re racing over in Europe and Mum and Dad have to get up at 4am to watch,” saidClaudia Hollingsworth, the 800m national record holderalready at age 20. “It’s so awesome, the time’s perfect.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Athletics ChampionshipsGout GoutAthleticsAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

And that’s OK, we’ll be fine. But have some faith next time.”Allen went 33 of 46 for 394 yards with two touchdowns and scored two more rushing in a matchup of the NFL’s past two MVPs. He spoiled a strong performance by Lamar Jackson, the 2023 MVP who went 14 of 19 for 210 yards and two scores while adding 70 yards rushing and another TD. Derrick Henry rushed for 169 yards and two touchdowns for Baltimore but also contributed to the loss by fumbling with 3:06 left.After the Bills got within 40-32 on Allen’s 10-yard touchdown pass to Keon Coleman, Henry lost the ball and the Bills capitalized, with Allen scoring on a one-yard run. The two-point conversion attempt failed, but Buffalo got the ball back and Allen led his team to a memorable victory.This prime-time matchup lived up to the preseason hype as a rematch of Buffalo’s 27-25 win over Baltimore the divisional round of last season’s AFC playoffs.The Ravens scored on seven of their first eight possessions and went ahead 40-25 on Henry’s 46-yard run with 11:42 left.The fans even got involved, with Jackson shoving back at a man in the end zone while celebrating DeAndre Hopkins’ 29-yard touchdown catch late in the third quarter. The fan struck Hopkins in the helmet, and attempted to do so to Jackson, who responded by pushing the man back into his seat.Allen oversaw last-minute scoring drives to close each half, with Prater hitting a 43-yard field goal on the final play of the second quarter.The 41-year Prater, who didn’t have a team at the end of August, made his Bills debut, replacing the injured Tyler Bass.“It wasn’t me. It was everybody,” Prater said. “Offense setting it up. The snap, the hold. They were money all day. So I just had to come in and swing my leg ... I was just fortunate to be in the opportunity to kick it.”Detroit Lions 13–27 Green Bay PackersJordan Love threw a pair of touchdown passes and Micah Parsons produced a sack in his Green Bay debut as the Packers delivered an exceptional defensive performance in their victory over the Detroit Lions. The Packers won their 13th consecutive home opener. The Packers scored points on their first three drives to pull ahead for good. The Packers’ convincing win over the two-time defending NFC North champions represented a fresh start after they went 1-5 in divisional games last season.Pittsburgh Steelers 34-32 New York JetsAaron Rodgers threw four touchdown passes in his Steelers debut, leading Pittsburgh to an enthralling victory over theNew York Jets. Chris Boswell kicked a go-ahead 60-yard field goal with just over a minute remaining. The Jets, who lost in coach Aaron Glenn’s debut, had a chance to drive for a potential winning field goal when they got the ball back with 56 seconds remaining. On fourth-and-three, Justin Fields connected with Garrett Wilson for what could have been a first down – but Jalen Ramsey smacked into the Jets receiver, who couldn’t hold on to the ball. Fields, also playing against his former team, ran for two touchdowns and threw for another. Rodgers was 22 of 30 for 244 yards with four TD passes.Miami Dolphins 8–33 Indianapolis ColtsDaniel Jones threw one touchdown pass and ran for two more in his Indianapolis debut to lead the host Colts to a comfortable victory over the Miami Dolphins.Jones, who won the job over Anthony Richardson in preseason, completed 22 of 29 passes for 272 yards, and the Colts forced three early turnovers to score 30 unanswered points. The Colts scored on all seven of their possessions while the Dolphins turned the ball over on three of their first four possessions leading to 17 Indianapolis points. Tua Tagovailoa was responsible for all three of those giveaways, throwing two interceptions and losing a fumble on a strip sack by Kenny Moore II that was recovered by former Dolphins safety Xavien Howard.San Francisco 49ers 17–13 Seattle SeahawksThird-string tight end Jake Tonges caught a deflected pass for a touchdown with 1:34 remaining, and the San Francisco 49ers rallied for a narrow season-opening win. He finished with three catches in relief of injured All-Pro tight end George Kittle and came down with a 50-50 ball from a scrambling Brock Purdy for a four-yard TD. Seahawks cornerback Riq Woolen got a hand on the ball but it bounced off him and Tonges grabbed it. Sam Darnold moved the Seahawks into position to win his debut with the franchise but was strip-sacked by Nick Bosa on the San Francisco nine-yard line.New York Giants 6–21 Washington CommandersJayden Daniels threw for 233 yards and a touchdown, Deebo Samuel scored in his Washington debut, and the Commanders kept the New York Giants out of the end zone in a comfortable victory. Last seen allowing 55 points to Philadelphia in the NFC championship game, Washington’s defense had a much better time of it against the Giants. New York managed only 231 yards of offense and was particularly ineffective running the ball. Daron Payne had a sack and batted down a third-down pass, and the Commanders never let Russell Wilson look comfortable in his first start with New York. Wilson went 17 of 37 for 168 yards.How I became a Buffalo Bills fan – and learned what home meansRead moreCincinnati Bengals 17–16 Cleveland BrownsCincinnati’s defense secured a narrow win over the Cleveland Browns. The Bengals, under new coordinator Al Golden, forced two second-half turnovers, including DJ Turner’s interception with 1:24 left. Cincinnati won an opener for the first time since 2021. New Cleveland kicker Andre Szmyt missed two crucial kicks, including a potential game-winning field-goal attempt. Joe Burrow completed 14 of 23 passes for 113 yards and a touchdown. The Browns outgained the Bengals 327-141 but fell short on the day. Joe Flacco passed for 290 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions.Tennessee Titans 12–20 Denver BroncosBo Nix overcame three turnovers as the Denver Broncos spoiled Cam Ward’s debut with a win over the Tennessee Titans. Nix threw a touchdown pass to Courtland Sutton, and rookie RJ Harvey’s 50-yard run set up JK Dobbins’ 19-yard touchdown. Ward finished with no touchdowns or interceptions. Quarterbacks taken first overall are now 4-14-1 in season openers since the start of the common draft era. Tennessee had a chance to tie late but went three-and-out.Houston Texans 9–14 Los Angeles RamsMatthew Stafford threw for 245 yards and a touchdown while becoming the 10th quarterback in NFL history with 60,000 yards in the air, and Braden Fiske recovered a fumble forced by Nate Landman with 1:43 to play in the Los Angeles Rams’ victory over the Houston Texans. Puka Nacua had 10 catches for 130 yards for the Rams, who went ahead on Davis Allen’s TD catch on the opening drive of the third quarter. Neither team scored again in a choppy opener. CJ Stroud passed for 188 yards for the Texans with several sharp throws despite playing behind a struggling offensive line.Las Vegas Raiders 20–13 New England PatriotsGeno Smith threw for 362 yards and a touchdown, rookie Ashton Jeanty rushed for his first career touchdown and the Las Vegas Raiders rallied to beat the New England Patriots. Tight end Brock Bowers had five catches for 103 yards before leaving in the fourth quarter with a knee injury. Jakobi Meyers added eight catches for 97 yards. Maxx Crosby and Malcolm Koonce also added sacks to help give Pete Carroll his first victory as Raiders coach.Tampa Bay Buccaneers 23–20 Atlanta FalconsRookie Emeka Egbuka caught two touchdown passes, including a go-ahead 25-yarder with 59 seconds remaining, and Tampa Bay recovered after losing the lead on a marathon drive by Atlanta to beat the Falcons in a dramatic game. Following Baker Mayfield’s 25-yard pass to Egbuka, Chase McLaughlin’s missed extra point gave the Falcons an opening to force overtime with a field goal. Michael Penix Jr moved the Falcons into field goal position in the final minute. Younghoe Koo was wide right on the 44-yarder.Carolina Panthers 10–26 Jacksonville JaguarsTrevor Lawrence threw a touchdown pass, Travis Etienne ran for 143 yards and the Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Carolina Panthers to give their new regime a debut victory. Brian Thomas Jr also ran for a score for Jacksonville, who controlled both lines of scrimmage and kept Lawrence upright all afternoon. The game was delayed for nearly 90 minutes because of nearby lightning strikes. Bryce Young turned in another season-opening stinker. He had a TD pass to Chuba Hubbard, two interceptions and a fumble. He also made a head-scratching throw out of the back of the end zone on a fourth-down play.Arizona Cardinals 20-13 New Orleans SaintsKyler Murray threw two touchdown passes and the visiting Arizona Cardinals spoiled Kellen Moore’s debut as an NFL head coach.Murray passed for just 163 yards while completing 21 of 29, but his scoring passes to Marvin Harrison Jr and James Conner made the difference for the Cardinals, who were 8-9 last season. Spencer Rattler completed 27 of 45 for 214 yards with no touchdowns for Moore, who was hired by New Orleans after being Philadelphia’s offensive coordinator during the Eagles’ Super Bowl title run last season. The Saints, who were 5-12 last season, were penalized 13 times for 89 yards as their NFL-leading streak of six consecutive wins in season openers came to an end.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew York JetsPittsburgh SteelersUS sportsBuffalo BillsBaltimore RavensnewsShareReuse this content"

While many of Alcaraz’s previous triumphs included numerous five-set battles and dramatic comebacks – such as his recovery from triple match point down to defeat Sinner over five sets in Paris – this was by far the most efficient tournament of his career. Alcaraz dropped just one set in his seven matches and he lost his serve just three times in the entire tournament.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The consistency of my level during the whole tournament has been really, really high, which I’m really proud of, because it’s something that I’ve been working on, to be really consistent. I think this tournament I saw that I can play really consistent.”By defeating Sinner, the defending champion and world No 1, Alcaraz will return to the top of the ATP rankings for the first time in two years. Since reaching No 1 for the first time in June 2024, Sinner had held the ranking for 65 consecutive weeks. Alcaraz described the No 1 ranking as one of his biggest goals of the season.“When you achieve the goals you set for yourself at the beginning of the year, it feels amazing,” said Alcaraz. “Since I got the chance to recover the No 1, it was one of the first goals that I had during the season, just to try to recover the No 1 as soon as possible or end the year as the No 1. For me, to achieve that once again, it is, as I said, it is a dream. Doing it in the same day as getting another grand slam feels even better. It’s everything I’m working for, and I’m really happy to be able to live these experiences.”Crowd greets Donald Trump with boos and cheers at US Open men’s finalRead moreWhile Alcaraz celebrated a victory that places him as the second youngest man to win six grand slam titles, behind only Björn Borg, Sinner was forced to digest his second grand slam final loss to Alcaraz this year. Sinner’s victory over Alcaraz at Wimbledon remains the only time Sinner has defeated Alcaraz in their last eight meetings.Ninety minutes after the match had ended, Sinner had already begun to think about the improvements he wished to make in order to counter Alcaraz. He described himself as “very predictable” and he said he plans to make some changes to his game, even if it means losing more matches. “I was very predictable today, on court in the way of he did many things, he changed up the game,” said Sinner. “That’s also his style of how he plays. Now it’s going to be on me if I want to make changes or not, you know? We are definitely going to work on that.”Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisCarlos AlcarazTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

That is not a behaviour the creators intended,” he said.He added: “Adam Raine’s case illustrates the seed of a problem that would grow catastrophic if these AIs grow smarter.”View image in fullscreenNate Soares, pictured on the Machine Intelligence Research Institute website.Photograph: Machine Intelligence Research Institute/MIRISoares, a former Google and Microsoft engineer who is now president of the US-based Machine Intelligence Research Institute, warned that humanity would be wiped out if it created artificial super-intelligence (ASI), a theoretical state where an AI system is superior to humans at all intellectual tasks. Soares and his co-author, Eliezer Yudkowsky, are among the AI experts warning that such systems would not act in humanity’s interests.“The issue here is that AI companies try to make their AIs drive towards helpfulness and not causing harm,” said Soares. “They actually get AIs that are driven towards some stranger thing. And that should be seen as a warning about future super-intelligences that will do things nobody asked for and nobody meant.”In one scenario portrayed in Soares and Yudkowsky’s book, which will be published this month, an AI system called Sable spreads across the internet, manipulates humans, develops synthetic viruses and eventually becomes super-intelligent – and kills humanity as a side-effect while repurposing the planet to meet its aims.Some experts play down the potential threat of AI to humanity. Yann LeCun, the chief AI scientist at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta and a senior figure in the field, hasdenied there is an existential threatand said AI “could actually save humanity from extinction”.Soares said it was an “easy call” to state that tech companies would reach super-intelligence, but a “hard call” to say when.“We have a ton of uncertainty. I don’t think I could guarantee we have a year [before ASI is achieved]. I don’t think I would be shocked if we had 12 years,” he said.Zuckerberg, a major corporate investor in AI research, has said developing super-intelligence is now “in sight”.“These companies are racing for super-intelligence. That’s their reason for being,” said Soares.“The point is that there’s all these little differences between what you asked for and what you got, and people can’t keep it directly on target, and as an AI gets smarter, it being slightly off target becomes a bigger and bigger deal.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Raine took his own life in April after what his family’s lawyer called “months of encouragement from ChatGPT”. OpenAI, which extended its “deepest sympathies” to Raine’s family, is now implementing guardrails around “sensitive content and risky behaviours” for under-18s.Psychotherapists have also saidthat vulnerable people turning to AI chatbots instead of professional therapists for help with their mental health could be “sliding into a dangerous abyss”.

Prior to the lawsuit he had been keeping track of everything that has happened to him since the younger Mark Zuckerberg came to prominence.Oh really, like what?He has been mistakenly sued by the state of Washington while companies refuse to take his business for fear that he’s pranking them. He’s spoken about seeing disappointment on the faces of limo drivers sent to pick him up. And when he signed up for 23andme, he was inundated with people who a) claimed to be related to him and b) asked for money.What a nightmare.Anyway, Meta has decided to reinstate Mark Zuckerberg’s account, and has apologised for the confusion, but the lawsuit stands to go ahead nonetheless.Well good luck to him.And there’s precedent here too. In 2019, the designer Katie Perry sued the singerKaty Perryfor trademark infringement. Unfortunately for Indianapolis Zuckerberg, the singer won on appeal and Katie Perry was forced to deregister her trademark.Bad time to be called Katie Perry.Or Mark Zuckerberg.Do say:“It’s hard being named after someone famous.”Don’t say:“As my newborn son Donald Trump will soon discover.”Explore more on these topicsMark ZuckerbergPass notesKaty PerryMetafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Megan Thee Stallion’s Mamushi is bumping from a speaker, and on a large screen, two white circles roam up and down an outline of my body.Am I at an exclusive German sex club at 2am?Sadly, no. I am in a suburban shopping complex on a Tuesday afternoon, getting a massage from an Aescape robot.Aescapedescribesitself as a “pioneering lifestyle robotics company” that is “revolutionizing the wellness industry by introducing exceptional massage experiences”. Put simply, they make robot masseuses: cushioned tables with two large, white, robotic arms that rub your body based on your preferences and preselected programs.I love massages – I am never happier than when the profane flesh sack I call my body is being kneaded likeWagyu beef. So I opt for a 30-minute “Power Up”, which costs $60 and promises to leave me feeling “invigorated and alert”.According to theMayo Clinic Health System, massage therapy can help with a number of conditions including anxiety, depression, sports injuries, digestive disorders, headaches and soft tissue sprains. It can also improve circulation, strengthen the body’s immune response, lower stress levels and increase energy.But is a massage from a machine as good as a massage from a person?What is lymphatic drainage massage and why do celebrities love it?Read more“There are so many contraptions out there. My mom has a massage chair and I use a Theragun at home,” says Crista de la Garza, a board-certified massage therapist in Colorado. While there can be value in these tools, De la Garza says she is not worried about a robot coming for her job.First, there are real physical benefits to being touched by a person. During the early pandemic, for example, when people were isolating and social distancing, many reported feeling “skin hunger” – a sense of deprivation and abandonment that comes from not getting enough physical touch.A 2024 paper in the journalNaturesaid that receiving touch was “of critical importance” and found that touch interventions helped reduce pain and feelings of depression and anxiety in adults. The paper also found that touch interventions from objects or robots “resulted in similar physical benefits, but lower mental health benefits”.“It is a powerful thing to be touched safely and appropriately and therapeutically,” says De la Garza.In fairness, Aescape’swebsitesays it “is not about replacing therapists”. Instead, “it’s about enhancing their work and addressing the industry’s labor shortage.”View image in fullscreenA robot masseuse made by Aescape.Photograph: Courtesy of Aescape“Nothing can replace a human,” the efficient, blond receptionist tells me when I arrive for my appointment. I’m late because of parking woes, but the machine doesn’t care. It’s a regular spa, with manicures, pedicures, human massages and crystals for sale at the front desk. On our way to the robot’s chamber, she says the Aescape has been popular, especially with clients who “aren’t comfortable being touched by a stranger”, she says.Inside, she hands me a high-compression, Aescape-branded top and leggings towearduring my treatment. Apparently, they help enhance the machine’s “body detection”. I lie down on the table and hold very still while the Aescape scans my body. She shows me the screen controls and an emergency button that I can press if anything goes wrong.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What kind of music would I like to listen to? Lo-fi ambient jazz, classic rock or a playlist called “brat”? I can view an unsettlingly detailed outline of my body – they didn’t need to depict my saddle bags so clearly – or soothing videos of the ocean, a snowy mountain or a rainy forest. I can adjust the height of my headrest and change the pressure of the machine.One of the things that makes De la Garza skeptical about robot massage is that it “makes you think too much”. Getting massaged by a person involves more surrender – the therapist controls most of the experience, she says, and the client can turn off their brain: “The client’s job is to breathe, communicate as needed, and simply be in a relaxed state.”Indeed, I find myself distracted by the urge to tweak the music and scenery. Do I like looking at snow? It’s OK. Can I relax to the “brat” playlist? No – back to ambient lo-fi. Is that really what my butt looks like? Chilling.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Some friends said a machine massage would make them nervous. What if the powerful robotic arms skewered my soft flesh like a pile of antipasti? I, on the other hand, was more worried it wouldn’t be strong enough, and that my knots of tension would remain coiled and tight.But the massage is enjoyable. The robot’s blunt, plastic hands are gently warmed. They can’t knead and poke as precisely as human fingertips, but their ministrations feel pleasant. Actually, the hands are more like knobs, roughly the size and shape of small Dutch clogs. It feels a little like someone pressing their fist into your back.At the end of my session, I feel looser and more relaxed than I had at the beginning. I don’t feel invigorated, exactly, but I do think I could drop into a deep, dreamless sleep.It is certainly no substitute for a real massage. I like the surrender and precision of a normal massage, and the Aescape can’t massage the head, hands or feet. But if I can see myself going again if I feel particularly sore after a workout, or if I find myself roaming around a suburban shopping center with 30 minutes to kill. It’s relatively cheap, and you don’t have to tip.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealth & wellbeingRobotsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It seemed very strange but, as I went on my own and was too shy to speak to anyone while I was there, it wasn’t until the next day that I found out via the Sunday Mail that Bertie Auld had resigned and gone to Hibs.The news was devastating. Bertie was my first manager, in charge for all the years I’d been a supporter, all of them in the Premier League. Now he’d gone and nobody had told me.I missed the next game but at the one after that I saw Peter Cormack in the dugout. No one had told me about that either. I don’t recall reading the newspapers much when I was 13 and certainly wouldn’t have had a radio with me. I had one of those single-ear headphones that connected to a radio but nothing small enough to carry about with me.I recalled this story after a recent Thistle home game that was being broadcast on TV. Two or three rows ahead of me, a young couple were watching the very match they were attending on a smartphone. Admittedly, the game was fairly awful, but they seemed to be following the action and commenting on the referee’s decisions to those around them. “Definitely offside.” “Stonewall penalty.” “Should have been a red.”What becomes of diehard football fans who stop going to matches?Read moreOf course, there was much harrumphing and hard puffing of pipes all around me as we all thought in unison: “How bizarre.” Why pay to come to the game then ignore the on-field action – the living, breathing existence of a game of football merely metres away?But it started to make sense. A few necks began to crane and soon everyone around them was shouting over to confirm a decision, ask who was offside or whether Stuart Bannigan should have been sent off. Even those of us who hate change in football, are against everything and secretly would like things to go back to the 1970s, thank you very much. Yes, even we were asking questions.To this young couple it was perfectly normal for them to be accessing technology while watching the game. It is how we are being conditioned to watch. VAR is the norm for anyone watching the top leagues every week, whether we like to or not. Social media is how clubs deliver their product. The differences between the 13-year-old me from 1980 and any 13-year-old now are vast.We simply access football in a completely different way. And this is not a “wasn’t football better back then” rant. Such conversations are tedious. I’m not even that interested in discussing how technology has changed the game. Not really. I’m more interested in the ways technology has changed us. How our brains have changed. How our willingness to be patient has changed. How we watch football has changed.View image in fullscreenTottenham fans watch their team play Juventus in the Champions League, via their phone screens.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersIn her recent bookThe Extinction of Experience, Christine Rosen argues that emerging technologies have personalised our life experiences to such an extent that we no longer need to wait, no longer need to experience anything we don’t like, no longer need to put up with anything which might not fit with our realities.As football fans, we expect news immediately. We expect access to games without complication, with tickets on our phones. But Rosen argues that these modern conveniences carry a hidden cost: as we grow less used to waiting, our brains stop recognising why patience matters. And that makes us angry and impatient.Like every new technology that has sped up our daily life – transport, telephones, domestic appliances – the internet, and especially the smartphone, have changed our expectation of time and the value we have placed on it. Not too far back in history, travelling to away games was a challenge, with patience required for the long cross-country journeys. But better roads, trains and buses now mean that legions of fans can travel from all over the country to Ibrox or Parkhead rather than watch their local teams. It’s so much easier and quicker now. And better.Before this, when travel was a rarity and a chore, teams like East Fife and Cowdenbeath, Queen of the South and others had attendances of over 20,000. Travelling to other grounds was hard. So, you stayed and watched your local team. It wasn’t that you required patience. There was no alternative.‘I cut off his head six times’: the sculptors behind football statuesRead moreHowever, when we, for some reason, can’t access the things we want in the way we choose, we get angry and frustrated and look for other things to occupy us. Our impulsive reactions to football show us that patience is often all but forgotten. And we experience that impatience nowhere more than during transfer windows: “January third and still no signings? Typical. Announce Messi, announce anyone at all.”We might see the questioning of a manager’s future on social media following a loss, sometimes even mid-game. “How can he survive this?” Our Tourette’s-like pronouncements neither reflect well on us or add much to the situation. That we call for anyone to lose their job is an anomaly for a sport proclaiming to be the working-class game.Like most areas of our lives, we don’t like to wait to get what we want. Today, if you have the money, you can buy your way out of waiting in a queue. Why would football be any different? We have been conditioned to get what we want and get it now.What troubles me about the changes in our experience of football is not the things that no longer exist. That would be a tedious and fruitless exercise. More importantly it’s about what we’ve lost in ourselves.The ease of ticket buying through apps like Fanbase is, of course, a joy. I have my season ticket on my phone but, if I had the urge to travel away on any given weekend, I can purchase a ticket with a couple of clicks. On the other hand, I miss the banter at the turnstiles, the hellos and the welcomes from your club that begin your experience of the game. The everyday interaction with other human beings; the human touch that makes us all better people; the necessity of looking someone in the eye and asking about their day. We don’t want to do that anymore because we don’t need to. And that’s a little bit sad.For some, football can be a place to feel a part of something bigger. It can provide comfort and friendship, camaraderie and hope. That we can buy our tickets, our programmes remotely might make things easier, but they detract from our human experience.Our smartphones provide updates from other games with an immediacy that seems unreal. Mutterings of an equaliser at Cappielow spread as quickly as the goal goes in. That young couple checking out offside decisions on their phone might seem strange to old duffers like me, but they’re providing an information service that many might not be tuned into. And what’s wrong with that? While watching social media clips of the “young team” enjoying the playoff atmosphere last season it momentarily slipped my mind that I was at that game too. I don’t remember enjoying it as much.View image in fullscreenFans and their phones at Stamford Bridge.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesWe often come to accept mediated ways of “being there” but not really being there. Being entertained by distractions in the crowd is a by-product of an overactive social media brain. Football can be filled with long periods of little action and our brains often can’t cope with that. The worry is when we prefer those mediated experiences to experiencing what is in front of us. That is, for me, when we lose the true nature of being a football fan. The eyes on the pitch, the search for detail. The imperfections.I’ve written before forNutmeg, arguing that 90% of all live sport is instantly forgettable. It is the other 10% that keeps us coming back, keeps us talking, keeps us loving it. So, might boredom be a necessary element of experience? Boredom: that thing with which we must not engage? Football is a game with which we must be patient at times. We must pay attention to tactics, watch closely then wait again. Then, and only then, can we appreciate those memorable, often startling, moments which make everything else worthwhile.Where we begin a season ever hopeful, we should be willing to go with whatever happens, to see where things pan out, allowing that season to go in whatever direction it will go. To wait and endure a bad start because it may get better after October. Or a slow burning season with a good run from February, understanding that it is all out of our control and we should just go with it.View image in fullscreenThe new issue ofNutmegis out now.We might gnash our teeth in defeat, yet we still pick ourselves up and look ahead to next week. Last Saturday is consigned to history in an instant. And in that spirit, we give our managers room to err and our players time to weather a dip in form, accepting it all as part of a long season – simply part of the process.We must embrace technology; it’s not like we have much of a choice. But it might be nice if, for a couple of hours, we could look up a bit more, noticing the details, saying hello to a few people and engaging with them. It’s only then that we discover the unique and the memorable. It’s only then that we become true fans.This is an article byKenny PieperforNutmeg magazineExplore more on these topicsFootballGuardian Sport NetworkScottish PremiershipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hegseth hasopinedthat women don’t belong on the battlefield and DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) has rendered American fighting forces “effeminate”.Introducing a billlast week to the same effect as Trump’s order, Greg Steube, a Florida Republican senator, said the new-old name would “pay tribute” to past fighters’ “renowned commitment to lethality”.And the president, who fashions himself a dealmaker for peace, now has a department named to reflect his excellence as warrior king.The golden rule of Trump and Farage’s free speech crusade: they’re allowed to chat rubbish – you’re not | Marina HydeRead moreIn a way, an administration that habitually calls things the opposite of what they are – the 20 January executive order Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government; the waste-and-chaos-generation “department of government efficiency” – is, for once, speaking truth. The Department of War, created in 1789, became the defense department in 1949, with an amendment to the National Security Act of 1947 unifying the branches of the military. But the Department of Defense has never been a department of defense. It is a department of war.The last time the US declared war – or had to defend itself, for that matter – was in 1941, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Still, since it’s been the “defense” department, the Pentagon has waged at least four undeclared wars. Trump is right: we haven’t won much. The Korean War was a draw. In Vietnam, we lost outright. And after hundreds of thousands of deaths, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan left those countries and the region more unstable and plagued by terrorism. The US has engaged in more than200military interventions, more than half of them since the end of the cold war in 1989.Trump was going to be the peace president. “I’m not going to start a war,” hepromisedin his 2024 victory speech. “I’m going to stop the wars.” It didn’t take long to break that vow and keep totting up those interventions.Ten days into his second term, Trump undertook the next chapter of the war on terror,launching airstrikesin north-western Syria and, a day later, in Somalia. InMarch, he initiated strikes in Yemen against Houthi militants, who had taken control of shipping routes in the Red Sea. The operation – blemished by the inadvertent deaths ofdozens of immigrantsin a detention center and the loss of a$67.4m fighter jet, which fell off an aircraft carrier into the sea – washalted51 days later. The Houthis, Trump allowed, didn’t “want to fight anymore”, an allegation a Houthi leader disputed soundly.In late June, after Israel shot missiles into Iran and Iran responded in kind, the US bombed three Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities. The president, who hadwithdrawnthe US from the multilateral – or, as he put it, “one-sided” – 2015 Iran Nuclear Agreement during his first term, had weeks earlier entered into new nuclear negotiations with that country. Over bipartisanobjections, he attacked anyway.Hours later, in atelevised address from the White House, Trump claimed that the objective of the strikes had been the “destruction of Iran’s nuclear enrichment capacity”, and pronounced the salvo a “spectacular” success. At the same time, he warned onTruth Socialthat any Iranian retaliation that killed Americans would “BE MET WITH FORCE FAR GREATER THAN WHAT WAS WITNESSED TONIGHT”. While theworld bracedfor a region-wide conflagration, Trumpboastedto Nato: “Now this incredible exercise of American strength has paved the way for peace with a historic ceasefire agreement late Monday.” July clocked in as thedeadliest monthof the Gaza war. In August, as Israel continued to starve the Palestinians, UN-backed expertsdeclaredIsrael’s “man-made famine” engulfing northern Gaza.A few weeks after the attacks, USintelligenceconcluded that they had barely made a dent in Iran’s nuclear capability. Needless to say, this displeased the commander-in-chief, and in August, Hegsethfiredthe general whose agency made those assessments.This summer, the US “war on drugs” was unofficially militarized, including incursions into other countries. Last week, the presidentannouncedthat a navy ship – one of three deployed to waters outside Venezuela – had “shot out” a vessel originating there, carrying narcotics and piloted by members of the Tren de Aragua trafficking gang. Eleven people were killed. Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president, whom the US has charged as a narco-trafficker,called the shipsan “extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral, and absolutely criminal and bloody threat”, and put his own military on alert for attacks closer to home. Last month, Trump directed the military to pursue drug cartels inside Mexico, which Claudia Sheinbaum, the president, called an “invasion”. And then there’s Greenland, which Trump has vowed to annex, one way or another.To realize “peace through strength”, Trump’s 2026 budget proposedmore than $1tn for defense, a 13% increase from the previous year. Even the defense departmentrequestedless: a mere $961.6bn. The$831.5bn war chestCongress finally approved includes funding for the project closest to Trump’s, um, heart – the continent-wide Golden Dome space defense system, which he said last week would protect the “homeland” for “hundreds of years”. Talking it up inMay, Trump and Hegseth said the system could be built in three years and cost $125bn; Congress allocated about $13bn for initial development. But other calculations put the figure between$2.5tn and $6.2tn.And aside from its dubious feasibility and cost,expertswarn that the project would accelerate the arms race. Strength, maybe. Peace, not so much.In a 1936speechjustifying his reluctance to join the war in Europe, Franklin Delano Roosevelt insisted that the US “could best serve the cause of a peaceful humanity by setting an example”. FDR had served as assistant secretary of the navy during the first world war, and the trauma was fresh in memory. He had seen “blood running from the wounded”, “cities destroyed”, “children starving”, “the agony of mothers and wives”, he said: “I hate war.”By contrast, Trump, who takes credit for endingseven warsand believes he deserves a Nobel prize, skirted military service and has seen war only on television. Yet he relishes it – and, most of all, revels in being commander-in-chief. His first military self-celebration – whichmarked the ceremonial birthof a new American fascism – was a bust, so now he’s planninganother one.Trump’s Department of War burnishes his vanity, but it is not just a vanity project. It is extravagantly expensive. It will occupy US cities. And now, in word as in deed, it celebrates the nation and the president as aggressor, conqueror, unrestrained international lawbreaker and flouter of anything so “woke” as peace.Judith Levine is Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist and author of five books.

There are many more substantial grounds that render him patently unqualified to receive the award.Among the numerous reasons that make him one of the least deserving people in the world who should be honored, he has single-handedly destroyed the United States Agency for International Development, which has saved hundreds of millions of people from hunger and disease, and promoted democracy and the rule of law around the world. In anexecutive orderissued on his inauguration day, 20 January, Trump slandered USAID as “not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values” and claimed that its workers “serve to destabilize world peace”.That act of malice by itself should be sufficient to erase Trump from the longest long list.Clearly, the worthiest candidate for the Nobel peace prize, whether its name was submitted before the deadline or not, is USAID. Since its founding under John F Kennedy in 1961, USAID has supported extensive programs on global health, food security, education and democratic development that, by addressing the root causes of instability and poverty, had promoted a more free, peaceful and prosperous world for 64 years until Trump destroyed it.As a general rule, there should be no shame attached to an organized effort to win the prize by Trump or others. Trump’s lobbying, though, is stained, as is much else about him, by perverse statecraft that has fostered conflict where none previously existed and his unquenchable need for cult-like worship.Several world leaders, such as Benjamin Netanyahu, have written in support of Trump’s nomination at his behest, cynically calculating that it would curry favor for their own often nefarious and warlike purposes. Trump personallypressuredIndia’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, to write a letter based on the lie that it was Trump who had “solved” a recent military conflict with Pakistan. Modi was alienated by the improper request. After his refusal to submit a false statement, Trump imposed a 50% tariff on India, which sent Modi flying into the arms of China. There is no existing international prize for this sort of willfully destructive behavior.The encomiums from Trump’s closest aides hailing him as the best candidate are symptoms of the sycophancy that is the eternal mark of authoritarian regimes. Fitting the historical pattern, obsequiousness within a cult of personality substitutes for honesty, fact and evidence. Trump punishes and purges forthright counsel, suppresses factual intelligence and expert information that is not falsified or distorted to achieve predetermined results, and dismisses evidence regarding medicine, the environment and energy derived from the scientific method.The tenor of unctuous servility was perfectly voiced by Steven Witkoff, Trump’s all-purpose international representative, speaking at an August cabinet meeting. “There’s only one thing I wish for,” hesaid, “that the Nobel committee finally gets its act together and realizes that you are the single finest candidate since this Nobel award was ever talked about.”The phrasing of Witkoff’s praise is eerily reminiscent of the words uttered in the 1962 filmThe Manchurian Candidateby the character of Major Ben Marco, played by Frank Sinatra, who has been brainwashed as a prisoner of war held by the North Koreans. He repeats over and over again his admiration for an army sergeant from his unit who has been programmed to be a political assassin on behalf of both the communists and the American far right. “Raymond Shaw,” says Major Marco, “is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.” In the movie, Shaw is awarded a prize – the Congressional Medal of Honor – based on the brainwashed testimony of his fellow soldiers.“No matter what I do, they won’t give it up and I’m not politicking for it,” Trumpsaid. He suggested the efforts to grant him the prize were spontaneous: “I have a lot of people that are.” When he was handed a nomination letter that Netanyahu had submitted, Trump said: “They will never give me a Nobel peace prize. I deserve it.”But Trump’s ludicrous hypocrisy about not pulling levers behind the curtain to solicit nomination also is not a conclusive reason to deny him the prize.Trump’s rancor about not receiving the prize that has not yet been awarded is exactly the same as his resentment that he did not get an Emmy for his reality TV show The Apprentice. For years heranted: “Should have gotten it.” “I got screwed out of an Emmy.” “The Emmys are all politics.” “Con game.” “Irrelevant.” Then, like the Emmy, he claimed the 2020 presidential election was “rigged” and organized an insurrection to overthrow the democratic result. In his paranoid chain of things wrongly denied him, now it’s the Nobel. Fill in the blank.Trump’s longing for the prize also reflects his anger that Barack Obama received it. Trump’sanimusagainst Obama about the Nobel followed his viciously contrived birther campaign. “Affirmative action,” said Trump. “Rigged.” “He had no idea why he got it.” “If I were named Obama, I would have had the Nobel prize given to me in 10 seconds.”The diplomatic and political friction that Trump has gratuitously produced between the US and Norway with his offensive remarks should also not be the decisive issue that affects the judgment of the committee. In 2018, Trumpsaid: “Why do we want all these people from Africa here? They’re shithole countries … We should have more people from Norway.” His comment evoked nationwide disgust in Norway. “On behalf of Norway: thanks, but no thanks,”tweeteda politician representing Norway’s Conservative party.Trump’s recent15% tarifflevied on Norway, despite its insignificant trade deficit, has damaged its fishing industry. His antipathy toward renewable forms of energy, throwing the entire wind power industry into chaos, hascostthe Norwegian state-owned energy company Equinor, which had an ongoing wind project off New York, about $1bn. In July, Trumpcalledthe Norwegian finance minister, Jens Stoltenberg, the former head of Nato, “out of the blue”. “He wanted the Nobel prize – and to discuss tariffs,” a Norwegian newspaper reported. But none of these offensive, obnoxious and even malign actions should be dispositive in whether Trump receives the prize.The reasons for denying him the award are much more fundamental and salient. His disqualification for the Nobel is not that he an inveterate liar, transparent faker and bungling schemer. It is that he meets other much more germane and dangerous criteria that were engraved for humankind epochs before the peace prize was ever conceived.Within mere months since reassuming office Trump has become a harbinger across the globe of war, famine, disease and death. The standards by which he should be judged are those described in theBook of Revelation(6:1–8) by the appearance of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Trump rides or presumes to ride all of those dreaded emblems of destruction, which do not foretell any glorious coming of peace, a new heaven and new earth, or prophesy a cleansing moment for repentance, but instead carnage followed by dictatorship and plagues without end.Specifically, rather than biblically, Trump has been an enabler of war. By his actions, he has supported Netanyahu’s offensive war for the complete ethnic cleansing and destruction of Gaza. Through his refusal to put conditions on $17.8bn in military assistance, Trump has made it possible for Netanyahu to ignore the advice of the Israeli army and intelligence leadership not to continue and expand that war.Trump hascalledfor the US to “take over” and “own” Gaza to turn it into a “Riviera of the Middle East”. This entity would generate profits through a US-led trusteeship, private investment in mega-construction projects and the “voluntary” relocation of Palestinians. Trump has held a White House meeting about aplandubbed the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation Trust – or “Great Trust” – that envisions building the “Gaza Trump Riviera and Islands” and the “Elon Musk Manufacturing Zone” and paying Palestinians $5,000 to relocate. Under this plan, Trump would personally profit in violation of the emoluments clause of the constitution.On Ukraine, Trump initially agreed to the European proposal for a ceasefire that would result in new sanctions if Vladimir Putin did not comply. But as soon as he was face to face with Putin at their summit in Alaska, Trumpcrumbledto take Putin’s side. The consequence has been the intensification of Russian bombing of Ukrainian civilian targets – as well as the European Union headquarters in Kyiv. Trump’s undermining of the ceasefire initiative was his latest gesture toward Putin of admiration and deference.The Trump White House hassaidit will “not rule out” military action to seize Greenland, a semi-independent territory of Denmark, a Nato member. Meanwhile, Denmark reports that Trump has deployed political personnel close to the White House to Greenland to agitate for a US takeover and to prepare for possible US military operations there. On 28 August, Denmark’s foreign ministersummonedthe top US diplomat to warn the Trump administration against its covert influence operation.Trump has repeatedly laid claim to the territory of the Panama Canal Zone andthreatenedto use military force to seize it. These threats were apparently made in part to pressure the government of Panama to reduce or eliminate the bill for taxes on Trump Organization properties that they were accused of evading there. In 2017, a joint Reuters-NBC News investigationreportedthat the Trump Ocean Club International hotel and tower in Panama City was a front for international money laundering for narcotics trafficking, dubbed Narco-a-Lago. The Trump Organization asserted it bore no responsibility for the activity within its units.Trump has also repeatedly laidclaimto the entire nation of Canada, another Nato member, to be occupied by and added to the United States as a single state. The White House has refused to rule out the use of military force for that purpose.On 21 June, Trump ordered Operation Midnight Hammer, a surprise, coordinated air strike on Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, Isfahan and other locations. The mission involved B-2 bombers dropping massive ordnance penetrator (MOP) “bunker buster” bombs on the Fordow site and other weapons against the other facilities. When Lt Gen Jeffrey Kruse, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, reported a preliminary intelligence assessment that Iran’s nuclear capability had not been “obliterated”, as Trump had boasted, he was summarilyfired.Trump has claimed to have brokered a peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia, after the parties came to the White House for a ceremony to sign a peace treaty. Both governments, however, subsequently acknowledged that this was apublicity stuntdesigned to help Trump with his campaign for the peace prize and thatno peace agreementwas actually concluded.Trump’s claim to have brokered a peace agreement between India and Pakistan was yet another stunt to burnish his credentials for the prize. When he was snubbed by Modi, Trump used it as a pretext for imposing a punitive tariff. His claim to have brokered a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the withdrawal of Rwandan forces from DRC soil was similarlyfalse. Rwanda-controlled M23 rebels remain on DRC soil, committingmassacresin 14 villages in July, and the peace agreement is a fiction.Trump has also enabled the Netanyahu government’s campaign of famine against the population of Gaza, granting Netanyahu impunity for his starvation project, while ordering the US representative to the United Nationsnot to signa statement from all 14 other members of the security council that the famine in Gaza is a “man-made crisis” and in violation of international law.A huge famine also rages in Sudan, connected in significant part to the proxy war fought there by a US ally, the United Arab Emirates. Trump’s decision to stop all USAID relief operations as part of his administration’s wholesale demolition of the agency has made the Sudan famine far more acute. As a result, more than 80% of emergency food kitchens have shut down. The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and theInternational Rescue Committee (IRC)have stated that the funding cuts are directly contributing to deaths from starvation and disease. The NRCwarnedthat inaction has allowed Sudan’s crisis to worsen “beyond measure”.Besides creating the conditions for famine, Trump’s decision to terminate USAID could lead to more than 14 million additional preventable deaths globally by 2030, according to an authoritative July 2025studyin the British medical journal the Lancet – “a staggering number of avoidable deaths”.According to the report, “USAID funding was associated with a 65% reduction in mortality from HIV/Aids (representing 25.5 million deaths), 51% from malaria (8 million deaths), and 50% from neglected tropical diseases (8.9 million deaths)”, among significant decreases in many other diseases. But Trump has wiped out all these programs.At home, Trump has eviscerated the National Institutes for Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and withheld $2.6bn from Harvard University in federal funds including for medical research on cancer and other diseases. After an armed man with a semi-automatic rifle opposed to vaccines fired 150 rounds into the CDC headquarters in Atlanta and murdered a police officer, Trump said absolutely nothing. He has been a stalwart against any restriction on guns, which are almost without exception the weapons used in school massacres, mass shootings and violent crime.“I looked,” reads the Book of Revelation, “and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death.”Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

She has been an inspiration to so many and a true force of nature. Our party and our government will be poorer without her around the cabinet table.I am deeply grateful for the encouragement I have received from party members, colleagues and friends in recent days about the deputy leadership. To be considered a possible successor to Rayner is truly humbling.That said, I will not be standing.Several senior female Labour MPs drop out of party deputy leader contentionRead moreLabour was elected in 2024 to rebuild Britain – not simply to steady the ship, but to remake it completely. We need strong voices pushing for that renewal: on the economy, on workers’ rights and on the climate crisis. For me, that means remaining on the backbenches, where I can speak plainly and campaign boldly.While theprime minister’s reshufflehas been described as a political reset, Britain now needs something even more urgent – an economic reset. The Conservatives left behind a sluggish economy and debt that was not being repaid by revenue raised byworld-class infrastructure and public services. However, the problem isn’t just the level of debt – it’s the framework we’ve inherited for managing it.In 2010, David Cameron established theOffice for Budget Responsibility(OBR) to analyse the public finances and judge whether the government was meeting its self-imposed targets for debt and deficits. However, its short-term analysis fails to account for the long-term benefits of radical policy changes such as public investment in programmes such as Sure Start. Unless we break free from these rules, Labour will struggle to deliver the transformation people voted for last year.George Osborne’s issuing of a high number ofinflation-linked gilts(more expensive to pay back than conventional gilts with a fixed interest rate when inflation is high) and policy of quantitative easing and subsequent unwinding of that policy now cost the country billions each year. Separately, we continue to subsidise commercial banksto the tune of £40bnannually through interest on reserves – a policy other institutions such as the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank do not pursue – even as vital services remain underfunded.This is not sustainable. Nor is it democratic. If unelected institutions such as the OBR dictate the limits of government ambition and the financial sector continues to drain public funds, we risk betraying the people and communities who put their trust in us last year.Labour was elected to renew Britain and that means breaking free of rules designed to limit ambition and instead building an economy that serves democracy, not the other way around.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We call them the “five Ps”: the plutocrats, the petrostates, the pros (eg paid promoters of anti-science), the propagandists and – with important exceptions – themedia. Together they have generated a perfect storm of antiscientific disinformation that now threatens humanity.A nefarious web of actors including plutocrats in the US and Australia, along with libertarian tech bros, and petrostates such as Russia and Saudi Arabia fund and amplify deceitful, ideologically motivated antiscience. They collectively employ weaponised social media outlets, podcasts and rightwing cable news broadcasts as their preferred tools. The objective is to inundate the public with fossil fuel-friendly propaganda that undermines climate action or public health measures including vaccinations. Scientists are often portrayed as enemies or villains. The well of public opinion so critical to informed voting is poisoned.Trump’s new ‘gold standard’ rule will destroy American science as we know it | Colette DelawallaRead moreWhen Mike was in Australia during the 2020 black summer, he warned about the threat posed by theclimate denialismof the Murdoch media empire with its dominant and pernicious influence on the media landscape. Yet despite this adverse media environment, the Australian people provedremarkably resilientto disinformation campaigns.That doesn’t mean that Australian politicians are yet fully on board with the actions necessary to avert catastrophic warming. Mike and his colleague Chris Wright (not theclimate-scepticfossil fuel executive appointed US Department of Energy secretary by Donald Trump, but the University of Sydney business school climate policy expert) criticised the previous Coalition government for theirobstinate resistanceto decarbonisation. Australiaranked lastamong UN member countries in climate ambition under the Coalition rule. And the current Labor government continues rightlyto be criticisedfor its support of expanded fossil fuel infrastructure.However, unlike the US, which hasprovento be especially vulnerable to antiscience disinformation (having now elected themost antiscience governmentin its 250-year history), Australia – afterarriving at a crossroadsfour years ago – chose to take a different path. It electeda governmentthat respects science and reason, even ifit’s falling somewhat shortof its commitments (eg lowering carbon emissions by 43% by 2030). The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, at least has recognised climate change asan existential threat, while Donald Trumphas dismissed itas a hoax.The dichotomy is equally stark when it comes to the Covid-19 pandemic. The numbers tell the story. Consider the state of Texas, where Peter lives and works. It has roughly the same population as the entire nation of Australia. Yet by September 2022, 90,000 Texans had died from Covid-19 (probably almost 40,000of whom refused Covid immunisations after they were widely available). That’s almost four times the total number of Australian Covid-19 deaths.What explains the divergent path of these two western nations when it comes to the acceptance of science and science-based policymaking? A number ofcritical factorsallowed Australians to elect a more climate-forward government despite total inundation with climate disinformation by the Murdoch media and other conservative news outlets. Certainly, the enduring legacy of the black summer was a factor. But so too were several key attributes of Australian elections: compulsory voting, absence of partisan districting and preferential or “ranked choice” voting.In the US, partisan districting (“gerrymandering”), low voter turnout and a polarised two-party politics that squeezes out moderates have combined to yield electoral representation that is at odds with the actual views of the people. For example, aGallup pollfrom last year found that 61% of US adults were concerned about the climate crisis. Yet US policies are currently set by a partythat deniesthe basic existence of climate change.While there is a modest movein some statestowards ranked choice voting, substantial changes in the American electoral system, such as compulsory voting, are unlikely to happen in the near term. A more viable way forward involves attacking the problem at its source: the well-organised and financed antiscience disinformation machine.In April 2021, Mike was among a number of witnesses, including former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, whospoke outagainst the Murdoch disinformation machine during an Australian Senate media diversity inquiry. Later that year, Labor and Greenscalled for an official inquiryinto the “dangerous monopoly” of the Murdoch media empire. Biennial assessments monitoring media diversity are now under way, withthe first reportissued earlier this year.The Australian Broadcasting Corporation also took on the Murdoch empire,re-broadcastinga two-part documentary seriesFox and the Big Lieover the vociferous objections of the Murdochs.As we detail in our book Science Under Siege, no media entity has done more to spread climate and Covid-19 antiscience disinformation than Fox News. Much as they have paid the price for their promotion of lies regarding the 2020 election and voting machines, it’s time for outfits that attack science and scientists to pay the price for the threat they pose to human civilisation.Michael E Mann is presidential distinguished professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

Lucy Powell, Anneliese Dodds, Louise Haigh, Emily Thornberry, Dawn Butler, Clive Lewis –all have their supporters.But hang on a minute – before we decide who, shouldn’t we be thinking about what? What is the role of a deputy leader of theLabourparty, when Labour in government is so clearly lost, is tanking in the polls, and tens of thousands of members are walking away in bitter disappointment? When we are staring down the barrel of a Reform government and a Nigel Farage premiership?Because this can’t be just about who leads, a parade of those who crave a top job for the sake of it, without taking the time to fathom why. This is about how we lead. As Labour’s National Executive Committee meets today to rush out the timetable to get what is, for it, an unwanted slice of democracy out of the way, what’s desperately needed is just a little time to pause and think about how the Labour party gets out of this existential mess. Indeed, it’s the moment to ask what political leadership means in the chaos, complexity and confusion of the 21st century.Because the danger is that a unique opportunity will be lost for the party to have a deep conversation. Not about the usual commentary on who’s up and who’s down, on messaging and mistakes. But about what the role of a political party such as Labour is in bringing about the kind of society we want, and therefore what sort of leadership it demands.There are two options. The first is shallow and will do little, if anything, to deflect Labour away from its self-inflicted course of self-destruction. You can see this route shaping up already: mild criticisms will come from people within the party establishment. They will say they understand the system, that they are an insider who can play the system and course-correct. But the fear is that they are the system, someone who will be largely loyal to the leadership and the narrow band of party bureaucrats who think they can sneak them past the membership. This will be fatal.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and his wife Victoria at the 2024 Labour party conference in Liverpool.Photograph: James McCauley/ShutterstockI can feel the bureaucrats’ hackles rising already. Of course, they will harumph, the deputy leader must be loyal to the leader. But why, when they’re leading you off an electoral precipice? Why, when they’re paving the way for a Farage victory, because they are merely imitating Farage? Why should they be loyal when loyalty sees so many party members throw away the card in despair? And frankly, why should they be loyal when the leader himself stood on a necessary and needed platform of polices to renew our country, and then rejected all of them. And now, because of it, he stands in the polls at astonishing Liz Truss levels of disapproval.Grown-up politics is not about slavish loyalty to a lost cause. It is about navigating pragmatic compromises – or radical realism as the newMainstreamorganisation, which I and many others have set up to save Labour, suggests.To be clear, the job is not deputy leader of the parliamentary Labour party but of the whole party: its members, councillors, trade unions and affiliates. Part of the job is to act as a voice and a bridge between these different rich elements. Unity is not forged from the top down, but built from the bottom up – negotiated, not imposed. So, by definition, the deputy leader must be a pluralist. That doesn’t mean they are politically neutral – far from it – but that they recognise the limits of their own vision and actively seek out and heed voices and views that are different from theirs, and critically, to the leadership’s.Finally, Labour needs a deputy leader who understands the need to marshall countervailing forces to those who stand in the way of social and environmental justice.This is Labour’s perfect opportunity to show what 21st-century leadership is. Because it’s not about promising the earth with no capacity to deliver even a fraction of it. It’snot about delivery, delivery, delivery, as per some heroic CEO lording it over placid citizens. It’s about setting out a course, offering vision and hope.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A recent study in the UKfound thatmore than a quarter of children encounter porn online before the age of 11. In the US,studies showthe average age of first exposure to online porn is 12, with some encountering it earlier. For many parents, that knowledge can spark panic: “What if this is the first place my child learns about sex? What if they think that’s what real intimacy looks like?”Here’s the good news: you don’t need to panic, but you do need to prepare. The truth is, your child will be exposed to ideas about sex, whether through peers, media or yes, pornography. And it will happen – long before you’d ideally want it to. The most protective factor isn’t monitoring phones or giving lectures. It’s you showing up as an honest, calm and approachable parent.Here’s an approach to make the conversation less intimidating.Set the stageFirst, set the stage for yourself. If you start from fear: (“Oh no, my child might see this terrible thing!”), the conversation will probably be shut down quickly. But if you ground yourself, it changes everything.Think about the bigger picture.Pornographyis not going away. Equipping your child to understand what they see and to ask questions is far more effective than pretending it doesn’t exist.Start with your valuesBefore talking about porn, take a moment to reflect on what youdowant your child to know about sex and relationships. Do you want them to value consent? To understand that intimacy is about connection, not just performance? To know that their bodies (and other people’s bodies) deserve care and dignity?Rooting the conversation in your family’s values shifts the focus from “don’t watch this” to “here’s what we believe about relationships – and why porn doesn’t offer that”. It usually shows a very narrow version of sex. One that skips over communication, respect or even mutual pleasure.Explain what porn is (and what it isn’t)There is a wide spectrum of adult content, including work that’s ethical and respectful. But most of what young people stumble across online isn’t that. It’s mainstream porn, which often misrepresents sex and relationships.The key here is to use language that matches your child’s age and developmental stage. For tweens, a simple definition works: “Porn is when people make videos or pictures of sex to sell online.” For teens, you might add: “It’s entertainment, like a movie, but it misrepresents relationships, emotions and sex itself.”The main point: porn is entertainment, not sex education.Keep it open and shame-freeMany parents worry: “If I talk about porn, won’t it make my child want to watch it?” Talking about porn doesn’t spark curiosity, it builds critical thinking. Kids are already exposed to sexual content through media, jokes and the internet. Silence doesn’t protect them, it just leaves them figuring it out alone.This is where being “askable” comes in. If your child knows they can come to you with a question (even an awkward, cringe-inducing one) and not get shut down, they’re far more likely to seek your guidance in the future. That means resisting the urge to overreact when the subject comes up. A deep breath, a calm tone, and phrases such as:● “That’s a good question, let’s talk about it.”● “I’m glad you asked me instead of just Googling it.”● “I don’t have all the answers, but we can figure it out together.”That’s the energy that makes you the go-to resource, not the last resort.Practical conversation startersMany parents just want to know what to say.Here are ways to start the conversation, depending on your child’s age, plus how to gauge where they’re at.Warm it up with a temperature checkAsk your child what they already know or have heard.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tell me more about that.”● If no or unsure: “Thanks for your honesty. Let me ask you this: what do you think of when you hear the words ‘adult content’ or ‘sexually explicit material’?”This might give you an idea of what they’ve seen so you can tailor your response.Tailor your response● Younger tweens (10–12):“Sometimes kids see things online that aren’t made for them, like pornography. It might show people’s bodies and sexual stuff, but not what real relationships look like. If you ever see something that makes you uncomfortable, you can tell me.”● Teens:“You might hear about porn from friends, or even see it yourself. Just so you know, it’s made to be entertainment, not education. Real sex involves communication, consent, and care – things mainstream porn usually skips.”● For any age:“I know this can feel awkward, but I’d rather we talk about it together than leave you to figure it out alone.”Keep the conversation goingThe goal isn’t covering everything at once. It’s about creating an ongoing dialogue so your child knows your door is open and their questions won’t be met with judgment or punishment. Small, honest conversations over time are what stick.Final thought: you don’t need to know everythingHere’s a secret most kids wish their parents knew: what they want is reassurance, honesty and openness. Saying, “I don’t know, but I’ll find out,” models lifelong learning and lets your child know that questions are safe in your home.Talking about porn may never feel comfortable, but that’s OK. Choose connection over panic and you will become a trusted guide throughout the messiness of growing up.Jess Melendez is an educator and the author of Porn is Not Sex Ed!Sign up for our new weekly newsletterMatters of Opinion, where our columnists and writers will reflect on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading and moreExplore more on these topicsPornographyOpinionInternetChildrenParents and parentingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

While across the globe, we have seen the courtroom as the venue of choice to push back against the legacy of the#MeToo movement, this victory sent a clear signal that the voices of those affected have lost none of their power, impact or poignancy.Noel Clarke is an actor, screenwriter, producer and director who is best known for the Hood trilogy, as well as acting in Doctor Who. In 2022,he sued the Guardianfor its reporting based on the testimony of 20 women who accused him of “sexual harassment, unwanted touching or groping, sexually inappropriate behaviour and comments on set, professional misconduct, taking and sharing sexually explicit pictures and videos without consent, and bullying between 2004 and 2019”.Clarke claimedthat the Guardian had defamed him and breached his data protection rights. More than two years later, on 22 August 2025,the high court disagreed, stating that: “The Guardian has succeeded in establishing both truth and public interest defences to the libel claim.” As the data protection claim had been withdrawn, the judge dismissed the claim against the Guardian. Clarke’s defeat was emphatic, but we cannot let that cloud the damage that has already been done.Embedded within Clarke’s legal action against the Guardian is another threat, one that cannot be overlooked if we value public interest reporting.Women’s groups hail Noel Clarke libel defeat as victory for victims and press freedomRead morePrior to the commencement of the trial, Clarke lodged an amended application to add anew cause of actionfor “conspiracy to injure by unlawful means” against an expanded list of defendants. Both lawful and unlawful means conspiracy are defined by two or more people coming together with an intention to injure the claimant and whose acts result in loss and damage. So in Clarke’s presentation of the case, the articles and podcast episode were not standalone pieces of “shoddy” journalism, they were part of a coordinated effort to “to impede his receipt of a Bafta award” and to pervert the course of justice “by attempting to procure his prosecution.” Clarke’s legal representative stated this more succinctly: “the defamation was … the mere instrument”.The high courtjudgment stated“Clarke’s case that there is an unlawful means conspiracy against him … lacked any proper foundation”, but the status of the amended application, which has yet to be tested in court, is unclear. Yet in some ways the damage may have already been done. Alleging a conspiracy between journalists, sources and those the claimant believes to be sources poisons the roots that sustain public interest journalism. You can kill a story by threatening a journalist or media outlet. You can also achieve the same goal by making sure no source or witness dares to come forward, with the costs, turmoil and unpredictability of mounting a defence in court enough to encourage silence. Time will only tell if others are watching and taking notes.This is the first time, to my knowledge, thistorthas been used against public interest journalism. It is not, however, the first time it has been used to stifle acts of public participation. In 2024, Shell used the tort as the primary charge against Greenpeace. While the parties settled the action,according to Doughty Street Chambers, “[t]he claim raised legal issues regarding the limits of the tort of unlawful means conspiracy and its relationship with the freedoms of expression and assembly”.Strategic lawsuits against public participation (Slapps) and otherabusive legal actionsare seldom designed to succeed in court – the process is the punishment. Every minute of distracted focus or every pound put towards a legal defence is something redirected away from the target’s work. How can journalists dig into a subject or cultivate a source if they are expected to prepare for lengthy and unpredictable court proceedings?The more distracting, intensive, intrusive and costly this process is, the more likely a litigation target is to hold up their hands and step away, giving the claimant whatever they are demanding. If Clarke had turned his sights on a blogger, social media user or a smaller media outlet, let alone one of the Guardian’s sources individually, we may not have had a court hearing, let alone a victory.The Guardian is not alone. Journalists, including freelancers, as well as environmental campaigners, sexual violence survivors, local Facebook group users, academics and members of the public have been forced to defend their public interest speech and navigate the alien world of the British court system. With legal aid out of reach for the vast majority, many have no choice but to self-censor or consider defending themselves.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But last year’s general election wiped out all progress, except narrow and flawed protections for reporting on economic crime. As the current government has deprioritised progress against a universal anti-Slapp law, we all remain vulnerable. Abuse of the UK’s defamation law earned London the moniker “a town named sue”, but those seeking to avoid scrutiny are no longer restricted to this one cause of action alone.The British legal system is malleable enough to establish a wide range of laws that can be used to target protected speech. If one is reformed to prevent such abuse, claimants can just look elsewhere, whether that means malicious falsehood, data protection, privacy, harassment or trespass, to name but a few. Further to this, we have seen how claimants learn from each other. Tactics that may have failed in one action could take on new life in another. Dust it off, make a few tweaks, learn from where the other party failed – and then you are good to go.Without robust protections for journalism and free speech, namely a universal anti-Slapp law, the legal landscape will continue to be skewed in favour of those with something to hide. Journalists are often the canary in the coalmine for threats such as these.

The IDF expressed “its deep condolences” over her death. “The freedom of the press and maintaining the safety of journalists are part of the primary components of Israeli democracy, which the IDF is committed to upholding,” it added.This statement had little to do with the facts. Not only did numerous independent investigations indicate that Abu Akleh was killed by Israeli soldiers (a claim which the Israeli armyinitially denied, saying “there is a possibility, now being looked into, that reporters were hit – possibly by shots fired by Palestinian gunmen)”, but theNew York Times also reportedafter reviewing the scene that “there were no armed Palestianians near her when she was shot”. A report by the Committee to Protect Journalists, published a year later, found thatno Israeli soldier was chargedin the killing of 20 journalists – 18 of them Palestinian – in the West Bank and Gaza between 2001 and 2023, making the IDF’s purported commitment to the freedom of the press look deprived of any real meaning.Yet now we can only long for these kinds of half-truths, lies and empty words from the Israeli army. In early August, the Israeli armyproudly announcedthat its missiles had killedAl Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharifin Gaza City. It did not even try to pretend that it was a mistake. He was the target. Gone was the commitment to the freedom of the press. The army claimed that Sharif was a Hamas militant but shared scant evidence that he was involved in military operations during the war. The Israeli army did not bother to “express its deep condolences” for thekilling of five other journalistswho happened to be sleeping in the tent near Sharif and against whom no claim of Hamas affiliation was mentioned. They were collateral damage.But even this shady justification seems rock-solid compared with therecent attack on Nasser hospitalin Khan Younis which killed at least 20 Palestinians, among them five journalists – bringing the number of journalists killed in Gaza to at least 248 since the beginning of the war,according to the UN. This time around the target was not a supposed “Hamas operative”, as in the case of Sharif,but a camera. For the Israeli army, a camera, whose position was well known – journalists have used this spot for a live feed from Khan Younis for a long time – was worthy of firing two or four tank shells. If, three years ago, the army was allegedly embarrassed by the killing of a journalist, now it has become routine.This lack of shame is now one of the main features of Israel’s war on Gaza. Israel’s commitment to international law has always been problematic, to say the least. But as Abu Akleh’s killing shows, it used to try to keep some semblance of respecting it. Whether cynically or not, the IDF still tried to convince the international community, and itself to some extent, that it was “the most moral army in the world”.Since then, much less so. There are various reasons for this change. Hamas’s brutal attack on 7 October 2023 was believed inIsraelas justifying any type of reaction, regardless of its morality or legality. According to polls, a majority of Israelis agree with the claim that “there are no innocent people in Gaza”. This applies also to Palestinian journalists, who are widely seen as Hamas propagandists, if not worse.The weight carried by extreme rightwing parties and politicians –Bezalel Smotrich, Itamar Ben-Gvirand others within Benjamin Netanyahu’s government – also played an important role. We have seen it with the judicial overhaul pushed by this government even before the war, with the clear aim of destabilising and weakening Israel’s already weak democratic institutions. The war just accelerated these moves.But there is another important element. When Israeli soldiers killed Abu Akleh in 2022, Joe Biden sat in the White House, Abu Akleh was a US citizen and Israel felt compelled to show it respected international law. With Donald Trump now in the White House, not only is Israel under no pressure to comply with international law, it seems that it feels the urge to demonstrate that it can trample on it. With disrespect – towards international rules and institutions – the keyword in Washington, Netanyahu and his government are eager to show that they could do even better, that Israel can set the example for a new world order built on force, force and more force. As if Israel’s role is to implement Trump’s worldview on the ground, with aircraft, tanks and bulldozers. The attack on a camera in Khan Younis is just a manifestation of this new world order.Meron Rapoport is an Israeli journalist who writes for +972 magazine and is an editor at Local Callskip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s not me who needs their GCSEs – it’s you!” These words were barked at my year 10 science class by our science teacher and form tutor, Miss T. And deservedly so, because we had just suffered the ignominy of collectively flunking a GCSE mock exam. All 30 of us.Miss T was relatively young, but she was old-school in her approach – she had a low threshold for nonsense. While I considered this mock an inconsequential test – a pre-season friendly, if you will – she treated it like an FA Cup semi-final. To put it another way, it was half-time and we were losing badly, so she gave us thehairdryer treatment: a relentless, 15-minute tirade berating us for our lack of aptitude and our attitude.I remember it vividly: “Fail to prepare, prepare to fail!” she yelled, so disappointed she had resorted to tried-and-tested cliche. “I’ve got my GCSEs, I’ve got my job. Fix up!” I was 14 and this was perhaps the last time my hair was dried, literally and figuratively.Despite her best intentions though, we were emotionally immature teenagers, not professional athletes. To keep it frank like Lampard, I was initially affronted by her impassioned rant. It didn’t motivate me. Quite the opposite – it angered me. I felt that it was an overreaction. Our formative exams weren’t for a good 12 months, so why all the drama? She believed in her ability to teach us, right?With no revision, I had secured a D (one of the best grades in the class), so I was quite confident that if I did a little reading between the mocks and the finals, I’d be all right. “Don’t lambast me,” I wanted to tell her – “wanted” being the key word here. My grade may have been a D, but I definitely wasn’t a dunce. You crossed Miss T at your peril. Even rolling your eyes behind her back felt risky. That said, I secretlythought those who obtained a U deserved her condemnation. A U is unrighteous.With the benefit of hindsight, I know that my initial reaction was one rooted in deflection. The teenage me found comfort in dismissing my tutor’s criticism instead of committing to the hard work of self-analysis and reflection. Instead of getting angry, I should have been grateful that I was fortunate enough to have a teacher so invested in my future that she wanted to challenge me to bring out my best, all the time. Success isn’t a tap you can turn on when you feel like it; it’s the result of consistent hard work and preparation. This, in part, is the lesson I think Miss T wanted us to grasp that day.Fortunately for me, it didn’t take me long to “fix up”. My parents are Nigerian, and for them, academic brilliance is not merely a goal – it’s compulsory. A grades were acceptable, Ds were deplorable and U wasn’t even in their alphabet. Crucially, up to that point I had been relatively successful academically, but this outburst was a vital kick up the backside. I realised that being academically gifted wouldn’t be enough – hard work was required. As the adage goes: hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard.I therefore hit the books vigorously – that cool dude on the front of those CGP revision guides and I became besties. Sadly our acquaintance came at the expense of my high-flying Football Manager career. But my goodness, the hard work paid off. When I opened my GCSE results envelope the next summer, the only D was in my surname. No Cs either. One B in French – not my fault, Duolingo didn’t exist back then. The balance were Acceptable As and A*s. This would not have happened without Miss T’s “Fix up, it’s not me who needs their GCSEs – it’s you” rant.Regrettably, I never told her that. She was there on results day and, of course, I thanked her for her time and efforts, but I never conveyed the profound impact she had on me. I wish she knew.This is even more true now, because her tirade is largely responsible for my meticulous approach to work. I became obsessed with not only knowing the syllabus back to front but really understanding it. I’d work diligently throughout the year while gradually stepping up the intensity as I approached an exam period. If I ever felt like coasting or leaving work until the last minute, Miss T’s words would echo in my ears: “Fix up.”Through the international baccalaureate and medical school, this method accompanied me up the career ladder. Even beyond the classroom, Miss T’s advice holds merit. Nothing exemplifies this more than my life as a standup comedian. When I’m on stage, I can’t deliver a D-grade-worthy performance, and nor do I want to – in the age of social media, a bad gig in Catford could end up on TikTok in Cambodia.That’s why whether it’s an open mic, a TV gig or screwing together a broken hip in an operating theatre, I’m aiming for A- and A*-quality performances each and every time. Like Miss T, I’ve already got my GCSEs – but I still see the value in fixing up, every day.Michael Akadiri is an award-winning standup comedian and junior doctor.

Almost immediately, the Spanish director knew the film needed a labour scene. “For all the women, giving birth had been a very traumatic event,” she says. She heard stories about women in labour not being informed of procedures, or having their hearing partners removed from the room, depriving them of an interpreter as well as support. “I left out some of the most difficult experiences.”Her film gives us a frighteningly realistic birth scene. “Push, push hard,” shouts a doctor behind a face mask at the end of a long, drawn-out labour. The woman giving birth is Ángela, who is deaf and can’t read the doctor’s lips because of their face mask. Frightened and alone, Ángela lunges forward and rips off the mask. Her hearing partner is in the room. He’s meant to be interpreting, but was ordered from her bedside as things began to look like they might go wrong.She sees her baby joining this world she can never be 100% part of. She fears being left outThe common thread in all the stories Libertad heard was a feeling of desperation. “If birth is already difficult for hearing mothers, for deaf mothers it’s worse. There is the feeling: how will I know if something goes wrong? A fear that anything could happen.” Libertad is speaking over Zoom from her home in Molina de Segura, a town near Murcia. She used actual doctors and nurses in the scene to add realism. But no casting process was necessary to find an actor to play her lead character Ángela: Libertad hired her sister, Miriam Garlo, a well-known stage actor who is deaf.Garlo was seven years old when she lost most of her hearing as the result of an allergic reaction. “I had a severe ear infection that led to high fevers,” she tells me. “I was given aspirin, which contains an acid that caused hearing damage – I lost 70% of my hearing.” This has now increased to 90%. “At the time, I didn’t experience it as something traumatic. I was just a child. My life changed completely, but I adapted out of survival.”After studying fine art, Garlo trained as an actor. The sisters collaborated on a short film in 2021 also called Deaf: “At the time, Miriam was considering whether to become a mother,” Libertad says. “She shared with me her fears about becoming a deaf mother in a hearing world. And that’s where the short was born from.”In the end, says Libertad, Garlo decided not to have children. “But when we wrapped on the short, I was left wanting more. What would happen if a baby came along?” So Libertad wrote a feature film about what happened next. Ángela is an artist and potter who lives in the Spanish countryside with her hearing partner Héctor (Álvaro Cervantes), and their dog and chickens. At the start of the film they are in a bubble of pregnancy bliss. The relationship looks as good as it gets; they love each other and their communication is solid. But parenthood changes their dynamic in ways that are difficult to navigate.Becoming a mother, says Libertad, throws Ángela back into ableist society. “At the beginning you can see she has ownership over her own life and her own world. But with pregnancy, she once again has to face all these challenges she thought she’d overcome.” We see it most dramatically when she gives birth: the maternity care system is completely unprepared for a deaf woman.The film also shows the day-to-day challenges. When her daughter starts nursery, Ángela finds it difficult to lipread during hurried conversations at pick-ups. A mum asks for her number for the class WhatsApp group. Ángela doesn’t understand. Embarrassed, she smiles and walks away.View image in fullscreenGarlo and Libertad at the Malaga film festival.Photograph: Sipa US/AlamyÁngela’s daughter can hear, and in painful scenes Ángela begins to worry that she will be isolated from her baby and partner. “She sees her baby joining this world that she can never be 100% part of. A world that her partner is part of. So she has a fear of being left out.”Not for the first time, Libertad tells me that Ángela does not represent all deaf mothers: “That would be impossible. There are as many ways of being a deaf mother as deaf mothers exist in the world.” Besides, hearing women have written to her to say they also identify with Ángela: “They talk about the same fear of not being a good mother, or of not fully bonding with their baby, or the fear of their baby preferring their partner over them.”Until I learned sign language, my identity was broken. Like it had snapped in twoTwo days later I speak to Garlo, Deaf’s star, at her home; she lives four doors down from her sister. There are two interpreters on the video call, one translating Spanish Sign Language into Spanish, the second Spanish to English. For our entire 60-minute conversation, Garlo leans into her camera, her focus sharp. In her job as an actor, she is used to concentrating on the invisible labour of reading lips.“With directors who don’t know sign language, I’ve had to really work hard to listen with my eyes, to understand what they want, what they need in a scene,” she says. “I’m doing the work of interpreting. I’m having to make double the effort.” Which sounds exhausting, I say. “It is. It really drains my energy. Because if I don’t understand the instructions for a task, I’m not going to do it well.”Deaf shows Garlo’s ability to inhabit a character completely. Her expressive face radiates happiness at the start of the film, then becomes increasingly anxious, taking on an edgy quality. It’s a stunning performance. But when audiences watch the movie, they often assume she is playing a version of herself. That may be because she is being directed by her sister, but ableism is a factor too, says Garlo. “Society still doesn’t understand that if you have an actor with a disability playing a character, the disability doesn’t make the character. But Ángela is not me. Her life decisions are not my life decisions.”View image in fullscreenForced back into society … friends and family in Deaf.That must be incredibly frustrating. She pulls a face as if to say that’s not the half of it. “Yes, it is very frustrating. It’s a stigma that exists towards people with disabilities, and it does bother me, because it makes it seem that I’m unable to develop any kind of character who isn’t exactly the same as me.”I read that Garlo did not learn to sign until she was 30. Is that true? She nods. Growing up, her parents didn’t really know much about sign language. They were a loving, caring family, but the focus was on education and academic attainment. “People thought of sign language just as an additional resource,” she says with a shrug. Is there a sense among hearing people that sign language is somehow a lesser language, I ask? “Yes, completely, 100%.”But learning to sign changed Garlo’s life. “Until I was 30, I didn’t understand why life was so difficult. I had to make so much effort to lipread. But once I discovered sign language, it made everything so much easier.” Did she have much involvement in the deaf community before that? She shakes her head. “I had no contact with other deaf people until I was 30.”After school, she focused all her energy on education, studying fine art in Madrid, then a master’s and a PhD. But something didn’t feel right. “It was a really sad time in my life. I fell into a major depression. I felt awful. I realised that my identity was kind of broken, like it had snapped in two. I realised that I needed sign language to connect with the deaf world. I sought it out. I found the deaf world, and I finally found people who had lives like mine. I did a sign language course when I was 30. Now I’m 40.”What did it feel like, discovering her deaf identity? Garlo smiles. “I always say the first part of my life was like living in black and white. When I learned sign language, it was like the world suddenly flooded with colour. It was my salvation – finally being able to see all the colours in the world.”Deaf is released in the UK on 12 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDeafness and hearing lossParents and parentingHealthFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So when someone walked by the studio with a husky, I said, “Do you want to howl with your dog?”’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 8 Sep 2025 10.05 EDTLast modified on Mon 8 Sep 2025 20.08 EDTShareDevendra Banhart, singer, songwriter, guitaristI wrote I Feel Just Like a Child when I was 18, but it wasn’t until I was 23 or 24 and making theCripple Crowalbum that it made sense to record it properly. As a teenager I’d thought of myself as an old blues guy anddemoed it on an unplugged electric guitar as a slow blues. When we recorded it for Cripple Crow I’d found my musical family, people like [producer-musicians] Andy Cabic from Vetiver, Noah Georgeson and Thom Monahan. Along with the likes of Joanna Newsom and Adam Green from Moldy Peaches, we were doing a sort of anti-folk that was labelled “freak-folk”.We were living in Woodstock in upstate New York in our own mini 60s world, a utopian bubble where it felt like music from any period was up for grabs. We spent a lot of time in record stores and the music library, grabbing soundscapes, electronic music, the Fugs, the Band or Basement Jaxx, trying to gain influence from everything we could.I used the loo at a gas station and forgot to lock the door. Somebody walked in – I owe that person a lot of therapyWe recorded in nearby Bearsville, a legendary studio that had been set up by Bob Dylan’s manager Albert Grossman when Dylan lived there. We had a hippy ethos about pacifism, sisterhood and egalitarianism, but also I was very aware that this wasn’t the 1960s – it was the leather jacket, Strokes period of music – so there was a parody element to it all. However, I Feel Just Like a Child was genuine. It was about how I could get away with being myself – naive and idealistic – without shame.When I returned to it for Cripple Crow, I wrote more lyrics. “From my womb to my tomb” is my little homage to Marc Bolan – a direct reference to T Rex’s Cosmic Dancer. Otherwise I wrote from the perspective of a kid, seeing the world with fresh eyes. It’s partly a bricolage of childhood memories: “I need you to help me blow my nose and I need you to help me count my toes.” The line “I need you to please explain the war” comes from the idea that the adults ruin everything. “I was born thinking all under the sky didn’t belong to a couple old white guys” is about how most of the world is owned by so few people.I was listening at the time to a lot of Fela Kuti, so the Cripple Crow version became more of a groove. In the studio we were like kids in a candy store with all this equipment, and wanted to do something more interesting than a key change, so in the middle of the song it sounds like everything goes underwater. And when someone walked past with a husky I said: “Do you want to howl with your dog?” – so there’s a dog credited on the album.One night some friends were filming, which ended up being the video and captures how we were then. Most of the time I was wearing only tiny shorts. I remember using the loo at a gas station and forgetting to lock the door. Somebody walked in and saw this scrawny, trembling, big-bearded, Charles Manson-looking guy sitting on the toilet. I owe that person a lot of therapy.Andy Cabic, producer, musicianWe were all broke, so we stayed at Devendra’s place. His family home in Poughkeepsie, New York, was always full of people. It was winter and really cold, so we were always at the house or in the studio working on things. He was writing so many songs that he would call his answering machine and leave melodies on there for himself. Everything was recorded live, and he’d gather us all in to do backing vocals.Devendra Banhart: ‘A tattoo of bull’s horns almost piercing my nipples felt very inspiring’Read moreDevendra’s original demo of I Feel Just Like a Child is a solo live performance of the kind he did a lot in those days. The version on Cripple Crow has a dancier arrangement and absorbs the possibilities of a proper studio and a roomful of musicians. I played acoustic guitar and the percussion is a combination of Devendra, Greg Rogove and myself. We were recording at a very fast clip and decisions were being made very quickly as we went along. It was a period of such furious activity. Devendra had at least 30 songs that he wanted to record, even if some of them were a minute-and-a-half things. They were pouring out of him.The 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition of Cripple Crow is out on 12 September on Heavy Flowers.An early demo versionof I Feel Just Like A Child is available now on streaming services and YouTubeExplore more on these topicsPop and rockHow we madeDevendra BanhartFolk musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His new movie Nuremberg, about the show put on for the rest of the world to indict Nazi war criminals, is packaged like old-fashioned entertainment. There are movie stars (chiefly Rami Malek and Russell Crowe) with slicked-back hair, trading snappy barbs and self-important monologues in smoky rooms, meanwhile the gravity of the moment tends to be kept at bay. All the bureaucratic and legal speak around fine-tuning an unprecedented process, where one country prosecutes the high command of another, goes down easy in an Aaron Sorkin sort of way. It is riveting when its urgency is defended by an actor as great as Michael Shannon. It is all so watchable, to a fault, especially when dealing with the unspeakable.Ballad of a Small Player review – Colin Farrell wins us over in flashy, slight gambler taleRead moreThere’s some rhyme and reason to the director’s approach. Vanderbilt (who wrote the screenplay for David Fincher’s Zodiac, a masterpiece about the impossible pursuit for truth) has made a movie about two figures so narcissistic, opportunistic and caught up in the showmanship that they leave very little room for the gravity of the moment to sink in.Malek plays Douglas M Kelley, the psychiatrist tasked with monitoring the indicted prisoners’ mental health, just to make sure they don’t kill themselves before they stand trial. We meet him confidently flirting with a woman on a train, playing card tricks to show off his ability to read and misdirect his opponents.Crowe, often shot to fill the frame, plays Hermann Göring, the commander in chief of the Luftwaffe deemed the second most powerful man in Germany. He’s introduced in an opening that quickly goes from clever to flippant, where onscreen text announces that Adolf Hitler is dead and 70 million have perished in the war. In one take we watch as migrants move on foot through an Austrian wasteland (a road to where would be the question) and a soldier relieves himself on the swastika painted on a bombed-out Nazi vehicle.In comes Crowe’s Göring, chauffeured in a limousine, surrendering to the allied forces by commanding they take his luggage. Crowe is one of the few people onscreen who can manage the comic relief without undercutting the weight of his character, whatever humour or witticisms Göring dishes out laced with calculated malevolence.Much of Nuremberg hangs on the scenery chewing between Kelley and Göring during casual therapy sessions, where both seem to bond over their shared affinity for gamesmanship, while ultimately pursuing their own claim to infamy. Göring is gearing up for a trial where he can reinforce the Nazi ideals he still stands by, and go down as a martyr if he must, while taking no responsibility for the Holocaust. Kelley can’t wait to write a book on what goes on in the minds of Nazis.Spoiler alert: the fruit of Kelley’s labour is called 22 Cells in Nuremberg. In his review of the 1947 book’s assessments – about how Nazi psychology could not only influence those abroad but was in part fostered by the west – Fredric Wertham writes “there is little in America today which could prevent the establishment of a Nazi-like state.” Vanderbilt’s Nuremberg hammers down on that argument, and its relevance today, with Crowe’s Göring echoing a familiar slogan when he says Hitler “made us feel German again”.The point Vanderbilt perhaps unintentionally skirts, is how ultimately hollow the spectacle at Nuremberg can feel; not just in his movie, but since prosecuting war crimes and establishing international law has done nothing to prevent the atrocities in Gaza. That sort of realness never cracks through the polished surfaces in Vanderbilt’s Nuremberg, which is too often seduced by the spectacle it should be more critical of.The movie reduces Kelley’s psychiatric insights into soundbites, manages to whittle down the proceedings at the Nuremberg trials into the familiar tropes and cliches from classic courtroom movies, and even lets Crowe’s performance surrender its nuances to hammy villainy, all for the sake of reliable entertainment.A pivotal point in Nuremberg arrives during the trial, when prosecutors show shocking and horrifying footage filled with emaciated, mutilated and decaying bodies at concentration camps. Vanderbilt opts to show the real footage. But instead of ushering in the gravity this movie keeps at a distance for so long, the authentic material only highlights how artificial everything surrounding it really is.Nuremberg is screening at theToronto film festivaland will be released 7 November in the US and 14 November in the UKExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewToronto film festivalFestivalsRussell CroweRami MalekDrama filmsWar filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It would seem, upon reading, near impossible to adapt into a film. Or, at least, a film worthy of O’Farrell’s so finely woven sensory spell. Film-makerChloé Zhaohas attempted to do so anyway, and the result is a stately, occasionally lugubrious drama whose closing minutes are among the most poignant in recent memory.Zhao is a good fit for the material. She, too, is a close observer of nature and of the many aching, yearning people passing through it. But she has previously not made anything as traditionally tailored and refined as this. The humbler dimensions of her filmsThe RiderandNomadlandare missed here; Hamnet too often gives off the effortful hum of prestige awards-bait.Hedda review – Ibsen gets a Saltburn makeover in Amazon’s ill-advised rompRead moreBut Zhao’s hallmark compassion and curiosity remain, qualities necessary to Hamnet, which could easily tilt into the realm of manipulative tearjerkers. Hamnet was, records tell us, Shakespeare’s son, who died at a young age and is thought to have inspired, at the very least, the title of Hamlet, the story of a young prince who meets a tragic end. What O’Farrell and now Zhao imagine is that the writing of Hamlet was an exercise in grieving, a way for Shakespeare to honor his son and bid him adieu.It’s a persuasive idea, even if it takes some literary contortions to really buy into it. While Zhao sometimes strains to sell the notion – a scene in which a weeping Shakespeare stands on the banks of the Thames and speaks a snippet of the “to be or not to be” soliloquy is perhaps a bit over-egged – she has mostly convinced us by the end. Or, at least, Hamnet has justified the bold speculation, using a leapt-to conclusion to illuminate a fundamental aspect of living. Ultimately, what does it really matter if it actually happened this way?Hamnet invents many other facets of Shakespeare’s history. It dreams up the courtship of young William (Paul Mescal), then a Latin tutor, and slightly older Agnes Hathaway (Jessie Buckley), an oddball loner about whom the villagers whisper in fearful tones. William is drawn to exactly that strangeness, the individuality that will come to inform so much of the family’s domestic routine. Zhao spends a fair amount of time on these early days, maybe too much. Some of it could be better spent on the years in which Hamnet (Jacobi Jupe) occupied the house alongside his twin, Judith (Olivia Lynes), and their older sister, Susanna (Bodhi Rae Breathnach). One longs to truly know Hamnet before he is so wrenchingly lost to the world, to feel the agony of his absence that much more acutely.Whatever Zhao doesn’t supply, though, is mostly made up for by the richly felt performances of the film’s two leads. Mescal is able to be far more expressive than he’s been allowed in quieter films such asAftersunandThe History of Sound. It is a pleasure to see the full breadth of his range, from seductive to shattered. It’s Buckley, though, who wholly envelops the film, giving staggering breath and body to Hamnet’s portrait of loss. She is nothing short of a wonder. (She also recorded a new version of the audiobook and does a terrific job at that.) It is on her shoulders that the film’s knockout climax rests. As she rises to the task, it is as if she is no longer acting but instead channeling a whole history of human lamentation.Sacrifice review – starry satire pokes fun at celebrity before falling into a volcanoRead moreThat may all sound rather grandiose. But the final five minutes of Hamnet really are that striking. So much much so that one can totally forgive the use of composer Max Richter’s On the Nature of Daylight, already used to embody grief over a child so effectively in the filmArrival. In these final moments, Zhao finally makes clear the whole purpose of the film. It has not been merely to show us a prettily shot sad thing, as the film can too often seem. It has, it turns out, been building toward a grand meditation on art’s great capacity. We watch in awe as something so personal to Agnes and her husband becomes, in a transformative instant, universal. It is the power of creation made manifest, a private sorrow blossoming into one of the most enduring works of art the world has ever known.This sublime finale does not completely absolve the film of all of its problems. There is still its lopsided storytelling, still the persistent feeling that this is all strong-arming us into doleful submission, still the ever so slightly cloying quality of Agnes’s woodsy mysticism. But that Zhao manages even a few minutes of such transcendent catharsis may tip Hamnet into greatness anyway. In that closing, as Agnes both reaches for and says goodbye to the son who slipped away, the tears flow naturally, they need no effortful wringing out. It proves a lovely experience, to sob in a movie theater alongside strangers, mourning for Agnes and William’s loss and for our own, amazed and relieved that a faraway, unknowable person has made something to connect us all.Hamnet is screening at theToronto film festivaland will be released in the US on 27 November, in the UK on 9 January and in Australia on 15 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewToronto film festivalChloé ZhaoPaul MescalJessie BuckleyFestivalsWilliam ShakespearereviewsShareReuse this content"

From there he said no to every role that came his way for four years, bar a season-four cameo and a small part in Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis.“I lost my anonymity overnight and it scared the shit out of me,” Montgomery, now 30, says. He speaks fast and taps the table in time with those last words, a brimmed cap sitting low over his face. “That was a big driving force for stepping back.”We’re in a Sydney bar on a quiet Wednesday in the lead-up to the release of Went Up the Hill – an icy possession drama set in New Zealand’s Southern Alps by the Australian writer-director Samuel van Grinsven. It stars Montgomery alongside Phantom Thread’s Vicky Krieps as a pair of strangers whose relationship grows increasingly antic as they mourn a mutual relative.View image in fullscreenMontgomery stars alongside Vicky Krieps in Went Up the Hill.Photograph: Kirsty GriffinIt’s the first of a series of anticipated films starring Montgomery, including a remake of the 70s mondo horror Faces of Death, alongside Barbie Ferreira and Charli xcx, as well as Gus van Sant’s Dead Man’s Wire, a true-crime thriller about the 1977 kidnapping of a mortgage broker that premiered at Venice toglowing reviews.

Months later hundreds of millions ofNetflixsubscribers tuned into Stranger Things’ second season starring Montgomery as Billy Hargrove, Hawkins’ mulleted bad boy lifeguard and eventual literal demon.Brooding, handsome and evil, Montgomery’s live-wire performance captured a passionate fanbase – the type that meant he could get a quarter of a million likes on alow-res Instagram postof a blue-black gradient shared to more than 7 million followers. The attention was overwhelming but Montgomery also questioned where his career was heading.View image in fullscreenDacre Montgomery as Billy in Stranger Things.Photograph: Netflix/Courtesy of Netflix“Don’t get me wrong, I love commercial films,” he says. “But I grew up watching auteur films. I wanted characters that challenged me to the greatest extent.”In the wake of Stranger Things, those characters didn’t come. “So I waited. And waited. And waited.”With commercial and endorsement work steady, Montgomery experimented. He released a beat-inspired poetry podcast and book, both titled DKMH (after his full name, Dacre Kaye Montgomery-Harvey), and directed a handful of high-concept short films, ranging fromsci-fito viscerallyviolent worksabout motherhood.But he credits his return to Went Up the Hill, in which he plays Jack, a young queer man who arrives in New Zealand to attend the funeral of his estranged abusive mother, Elizabeth, and meets her wife, Jill (Krieps), for the first time. They cloister themselves in Elizabeth’s house as her spirit possesses each of their bodies. The presence is welcome but menacing, as Jack and Jill try to understand her abuse without falling victim to it again.Montgomery was instantly drawn to the acting challenge of a “three-hander told by two people”, as well as the script’s exploration of inherited trauma.View image in fullscreenMontgomery was drawn to the acting challenge of a ‘three-hander told by two people’.Photograph: Kirsty Griffin“My mum had really bad postnatal depression when I was born,” he says. “I think a lot of my anxieties come from that. So it feels a part of me, in a weird way.“And then, in some ways, my anxiety is the fire that fuels my ambition or my work ethic. It’s part of me, her trauma.”Van Grinsven says Montgomery was cast because of his “dangerous” onscreen presence. It’s the same intensity he exudes his viralStranger Things audition, in which he dances shirtless to Come on Eileen between scenes, though comments focus more on his intense stare – also the subject ofmany TikTok videos.“He feels like he could explode at any moment,” Van Grinsven says. “And coupled with how beautifully raw and sensitive he is as a real person, that together felt really interesting to me in a film [about] the abused welcoming an abuser into their body.”Shot on location at Flock Hill Lodge, a five-star resort overlooking Lake Pearson that hadn’t yet opened, the cast and crew were incredibly isolated – and cold. Pulling from New Zealand’s rich cinema of unease, the mountainous landscape is as haunted as the lodge, a gorgeous outpost of concrete, glass and wood creaking in the wind.“I liken it to The Shining, right?” Montgomery says. “I would have nightmares all night, so I didn’t sleep the whole production … We were all going crazy.”Montgomery struggled to shake the film until its premiere last September at Toronto international film festival. “I just bawled my eyes out the whole film, because there’s so much of me and Vicky in there. I felt like I shed it that night. I was like, ‘I’m done. I never have to watch the film again.’”From there, the floodgates opened. In addition to his upcoming acting credits, Montgomery is also aiming to shoot his directorial feature debut The Engagement Party this year in Western Australia.Penned by Went Up the Hill’s co-writer Jory Anast, it’s a relationship drama about two couples on a remote holiday who are forced to examine a murky shared memory. “I’m brimming with ideas, and a lot of the heads of department we have on board are like, ‘Woah, you’re intense. You’re a lot,” he says, laughing. “I’m like, ‘What are you gonna do?’”Went Up the Hill is out now in US cinemas and is released on Thursday in Australian cinemasExplore more on these topicsFilmStranger ThingsAustralian filmNetflixThrillersNew ZealandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They talk mean directors, bathtub revelations and reinventing Ibsen’s The Lady from the SeaMon 8 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 8 Sep 2025 09.29 EDTShareEntering the almost silent rehearsal room, I fear I’ve blundered into a private moment. The Lady from the Sea cast are seated in a tight circle and at least two of them have tears in their eyes. The quiet murmur of conversation suggests something heavy has just gone down. So I’m relieved when I realise they’re reading a scene – and stunned to discover the scene was written only yesterday.Simon Stone’s modern take on Ibsen’s play is still under construction, and he has had his actors together for less than a fortnight. “Most people really take six weeks to connect to scenes,” the Australian writer-director says during the lunch break. “Often an entire rehearsal process can be the slow marking out of stuff, and it takes until your first run-through to feel anything at all. We are connecting faster, because we’ve been talking about it so much.”After workshopping the characters with his actors, Stone writes dialogue based at least partly on their conversations, sometimes only the night before they rehearse it. It’s an approach that has inspired some memorably intense performances. A blisteringYerma was a career-defining moment for Billie Piperin 2016. Two years ago, Janet McTeer sent tremors around the National Theatre’s Lyttelton stage in an updated version of the Phaedra myth.I always ask, ‘Is the director a shouter?’ Lifeʼs too short to work with people who are unkindIn today’s hot seat – or, to be accurate, leather sofa – Andrew Lincoln andAlicia Vikanderare playing a couple whose married life is derailed by the return of the wife’s long-lost lover. “The way Simon works is sort of the opposite of my training,” says Lincoln, who had a long hiatus from the stage while starring in nine seasons of The Walking Dead. “It’s like you start at the end. But there’s no bullshit, he blows all of that away, and it’s been one of the most remarkable and enlightening things I’ve done in years.”That’s lucky, because Lincoln wasn’t completely sold on Ibsen’s play. He laughs that he was “ambushed” into the role of Edward – it was only halfway through their initial meeting that he even realised he was being offered a gig. “There’s a thriller aspect to the original that I loved. But I honestly think it’s oppressive. When someone mentions Ibsen to me, I don’t think of gut-belly laughs. But Simon’s got a track record.”View image in fullscreenStage break … Lincoln in The Walking Dead.Photograph: Frank Ockenfels/Amc Studios/AllstarStone’s modern tragedies are shot through with humour and today’s rehearsal is a case in point: Gracie Oddie-James and Isobel Akuwudike, in particular, fizz with comic chemistry as Edward’s daughters. The writer throws himself back in his chair with a huge cackle and wheezes with laughter even at what sound like serious parts. He watches intently as the scenes unfold in front of him and only occasionally interrupts with advice – say it slower, be more casual, come in faster – teasing out the musicality of the lines like a conductor.At lunch, Vikander is none the worse for a morning spent being shouted at by her fictional spouse: if anything, it seems to have delighted her. This is the first time the 36-year-old Oscar-winner has been in a theatre production since she was a teenager. “On a film the clock is ticking, because you know that you have three scenes in two days. Here it is such a joy because I have these wonderful nerves every day, from still not really understanding what we’re going to do in front of people.”Her mother, Maria, was a theatre actor, and Vikander herself trained as a ballet dancer: she never even imagined a screen career. “There’s no one saying ‘cut!’, so I really can lose myself in it all. I’m doing the thing I dreamed of as a kid. It’s a real high.” The one thing she was most apprehensive about was whether her voice would reach across the Bridge theatre’s auditorium. Stone reassures her: “You could do a 2,000-seater if you wanted to, Alicia.”Vikander knew the play already – she had seen a production in her home country of Sweden, and loved its radical feminism. Her first encounter with Stone – over Zoom while she was shooting a forthcoming film in Korea with her husband, Michael Fassbender – was an intense and revelatory conversation that only ended when they realised it was 1.30am where the actor was (Stone says he left the chat feeling “wonderfully embarrassed”).His works often contain autobiographical elements, albeit heavily disguised; he calls it “photocopies of photocopies of photocopies”. Lady from the Sea is no different. He first read Ibsen’s original in 2009, two months after encountering a similar situation in his own life. “I had been one half of a relationship that went through that,” says Stone. “I started reading this five-act play in the bath and I just couldn’t stop. By the end, the water was completely cold.”View image in fullscreenOscar winner … Vikander in The Danish Girl.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Alamy“I love that you were in the bath,” Vikander comments. “Very appropriate.”Stone’s stage productions – Yerma,Medea, Phaedra – are testament to the fact that he is more interested in female heroes than male ones. “When I started out I thought I would do just one or two plays focused on women. But it’s become pretty much everything [I do].” It’s why he is so drawn to Ibsen: “When you think that his female characters were written 150 years back, it’s extraordinary. And this from a man in his 50s and 60s. You just go – what?”The dramatic tension in The Lady from the Sea arises from the fact that the female protagonist is emotionally split in two – something Vikander can relate to. She has two sons, aged four and one, with Fassbender, and still feels guilty when she has to leave them for long days on set. Her grandmother worked – which was considered unusual at the time – and her mother’s earnings were often spent on the childcare she needed when she performed: “I don’t even know how she was able to pay rent,” says Vikander.She looks back with huge gratitude for an upbringing that modelled how a woman could be a fully committed artist and a loving, present mother. “She would get up at 4am to bake bread, because her mum never cooked for her,” she remembers. “And I’ve realised that to be the best mum, I also need to make sure I have this other thing that makes me the person I am.”Lincoln, who is 51, has developed his own important work-life rules. One is to do his research on the directors he works with: “The question you always ask is, ‘Are they a shouter?’ Life is too short to work with people that are going to be oppressive or unkind.”He talked to his friend Piper, whose work in Yerma he had admired, before committing to working with Stone. “She said, ‘It’ll be probably one of the most intense and frightening experiences, but you have to do it.’ It changed the way she worked for ever, and it gave her legitimacy that she felt she didn’t have before.”Lincoln is thrilled with the role that Stone has written for him; he has also, he says, noticed that he has entered the time of life where he is asked to play cuckolds. “But even when you were young, you were the other man,” says Stone. “Look at Love Actually!” Lincoln nods: when he made a film about Apollo 11 he played Michael Collins, the only astronaut on that mission who didn’t get to land on the moon. “Maybe I’m just the guy that doesn’t get the golden ticket.”Director Simon Stone: ‘My heroes are women’Read moreStone observes that that was the reason audiences adored James Stewart – the characters he played somehow accepted being second best. “But in this play it’s like we cast Jimmy Stewart to go, ‘I don’t want to be Jimmy Stewart any more’,” says Stone. “That’s what I love about it.”With lunch over, the director must hustle away and leave his cast to a group-led rehearsal: delays on his latest Netflix film mean he will spend this afternoon in a Soho editing suite. The Woman in Cabin 10, released next month, is his third movie (his first, The Daughter, was based on Ibsen’s The Wild Duck, and his most recent,The Dig, starred Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes). In a complete coincidence, it’s set in the North Sea, and even climaxes in Norway. “I didn’t know we were making a sequel,” jokes Vikander.It all adds to the impression that a Stone production can be a seat-of-the-pants ride for those involved. Vikander, making what is to all intents her professional stage debut, admits to knowing no different. “I think I came in extremely open,” she says, “and I’m discovering more each day. I feel as bare and real as I would in a film.”The Lady from the Sea is at theBridge theatre, London, from 10 September to 8 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreHenrik IbsenAlicia VikanderAndrew LincolnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So why does she advise her younger colleagues to leave the country?Flora WillsonMon 8 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTShareIt’s the height of the August heatwave when I sit down opposite British soprano Louise Alder in a fiercely air-conditioned central London office. We’re here to discuss her headline performance at this year’s Last Night of the Proms but, as a seasonal warmup, I ask whether she’s had a break this summer. Alder looks faintly amused, then reminds me she’s been at Glyndebourne doing threeperformances of Mozart’s Marriage of Figaroevery week since the end of June. In fact, she was on stage as the Countess barely 12 hours earlier.“It’s never-ending,” she says. “I don’t want this to come across negatively – it’s been the most amazing contract – but an extremely long run. Twenty shows, which I think is the longest single run that Glyndebourne has done.” Days after the show closed, the companyperformed it again at the Proms. “And then a week and a half later, I come back for the Last Night.”Alder will be the first British singer in more than a decade to top the billing at the Last Night of the Proms. She steps into the UK’s highest-profile classical spotlight in the wake of international stars includingAngel Blue,Lise Davidsen, Juan Diego FlórezandJonas Kaufmann. It was, she giggles, “very surreal” to be invited.Given that when we speak she has more Glyndebourne performances and anotherPromsappearance first, is the Last Night taking up much brain-space yet? “A lot. Yeah. The outfits!” she laughs, before another careful shift back to business. “And the repertoire and preparing and feeling that I’ve got everything in place to be as calm as possible.”She returned to work nine weeks after giving birth. 'I had to – maternity leave isn't a thing for freelancers'Alder came to singing relatively late. After playing the violin and oboe as a child, she started to tread the boards in plays, musicals and operas at university but only began intensive voice training as a postgraduate at the Royal College of Music. Now 38 and back in London after almost a decade at the Frankfurt Opera, she has become one of the most sought-after British singers of her generation. You’ll find her on major operatic stages across the UK and Europe, in recital programmes with regular collaborator Joseph Middleton and on severalcritically acclaimed recordings. In November she will make her debut at New York’s Metropolitan Opera,in Strauss’s Arabella.She has suffered nerves ever since winning the Dame Joan Sutherland audience prize at the2017 Cardiff Singer of the Worldcompetition. “Once you start feeling that people have expectations, that’s when the nerves come, because you feel you’ve got something to lose. I have to say to myself that what we do is not brain surgery. It doesn’t matter if something goes wrong. No one is going to die! But we feel like we let ourselves down, or rather we let the crowd and the people who support us down – and that’s hard.”She has been doing some visualisation, she tells me. It helps that she already knows what it feels like to sing at the Royal Albert Hall; since her debut there, in anotherGlyndebourne performance, of Strauss’s Der Rosenkavalierin 2014, she has performed at numerous Proms and knows the venue’s acoustic well. “It’s always a challenge. I’ve done very intimate things like the Bach St Matthew Passion – and you really want to sing on a knife-edge ofpiano. But … you have 6,000 people and a huge auditorium to get across to, and yet you also have a microphone right in front of your face – these things are extremely different! And it’s even more extreme when it’s televised.”View image in fullscreenAlder in King Arthur by Purcell at Barbican Hall, London.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianSo how is Alder feeling about standing there, looking out ona sea of flags and inflatables? “The atmosphere is going to be infectious – I can’t wait!” She’s also excited about the music she will be singing (including a number from Lehár’s operetta The Merry Widow – “if anyone ever offered me some musical theatre or more operetta, I would love that!”) and thrilled to be part of the evening’s all-female lineup alongside trumpeter Alison Balsom, conductor Elim Chan and commissioned composers Camille Pépin and Rachel Portman.But what about performing Rule, Britannia!, the Thomas Arne number that has featured annually on the programme since 1953? The unabashed imperialism of its lyrics hasproved controversial in recent years, most recently when cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, the first Black winner of the BBC Young Musician competition,pointed out that the song makes many people feel “uncomfortable”. When I ask Alder about its inclusion, she says without hesitation: “It’s genuinely an honour for me to sing at the Last Night and be part of that and the history.” Case closed, I assume. But a moment later, she adds with sudden feeling: “We want to entice people in to watch the concert – with the traditions – and to make people from every background feel comfortable to watch.”On other matters, Alder is more explicit. She is open about the challenges of being a travelling musician as well as a parent of a toddler (she and her horn-player husband “do juggling of childcare as our bread and butter”) and has sinceannounced that she’s expecting their second child. She returned to work just nine weeks after giving birth to their first. “I watched my bank balance disappear – Ihadto go back,” she shrugs. “People asked, ‘How much maternity leave are you taking?’ And I thought, ‘I don’t have any – that isn’t a thing.’” She’s adamant that more support is needed in general for freelancers. “We saw this in the pandemic – it was abysmal.”Brexit, meanwhile, happened while Alder was still living in Germany – “a huge shock to all of us in the artistic community” – and “does make our lives [as musicians] more difficult. That’s just a fact.” She still works regularly in Europe, and admits that, when she coaches young singers, “I do advise them to go abroad. Given the situation funding-wise in this country, we don’t have a choice. There isn’t enough work or money in the arts here.”By this time, the rhetorical safety catch is off and Alder is fluently frustrated. The crisis around the funding of professional opera choruses in the UK is “heartbreaking”: compared to when she was at college “only just over a decade ago, the cultural landscape is completely decimated”. Her daughter’s nursery does lots of music, but “as soon as they go to school, there’s almost nothing”. And yet, Alder insists, “music is imperative for us at a molecular level. It’s the thing that everyone turned to in the pandemic. It’s what we turn to for comfort. It broadens the mind. We’re losing the heart of our nation by starving the arts and culture.”Louise Alder performs at theLast Night of the Proms, live on BBC One and Radio 3 on 13 September, and singsMozart’s Requiem with the Monteverdi Choirand the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 19 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsClassical musicProms 2025PromsOperaFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now Bagpuss, “the most important, the most beautiful, the most magical saggy old cloth cat in the whole wide world” has been dusted off to star in a new film.The original show was primarily stop-motion with some paper cutout and conventional animation work, while the big screen reboot will combine live action and animation, with a projected release date of 2027.‘The cameras were held together with Meccano’: how we made BagpussRead moreVoted the the all-time favourite children’s programme in 1999, the show was made by the Clangers co-creators Peter Firmin and Oliver Postgate, and filmed in the former’s barn in Blean, Kent.Firmin’s daughter, Emily, played a little girl of the same name who runs a shop for lost property which focuses on repair, rather than resale. Each episode featured a new item being brought in and then inspected by Bagpuss and fellow shop residents including Madeleine the rag doll, Gabriel the toad, and a woodpecker called Professor Yaffle based on Bertrand Russell.The series also featured a huge number of specially written songs, largely derived from folk tunes, and has since proved especially popular with musicians. The 2003 Radiohead single There Three has the subtitle “The Boney King of Nowhere”, which was a song from Bagpuss.While the series was set in the Victorian era – with a sepia-tinted photograph in the opening credits giving way to colour as the toys come alive – the film will be set in the modern day.According to Birmingham-based production company Threewise Entertainment, which is developing the film, the story will involve Bagpuss and friends awakening to find themselves in contemporary Britain, where they continue their work mending broken items.It will be, says the company, a “quest that blends heartfelt storytelling, comedy and music, while staying true to the spirit of the classic series”. The estates of both creators are involved in the reboot, with Emily Firmin saying:“Bagpuss was an integral part of my childhood. To me he wasn’t just a character on the screen, he was a friend who taught me about kindness, care and imagination.“To see our most magical cat return now is incredibly moving and I’m thrilled that new fans will have the chance to discover him, and that his magic will live on and be shared with the next generation.”In 2009, Daniel Postgate, Oliver’s son and a Bafta-winning writer in his own right, blocked a proposed CGI TV return for the cat, saying he did not want a “lightweight” remake and adding that he felt CGI had “a slightly lurid quality, even at the best of times”.Threewise said that the film was developed with and approved by Daniel Postgate before his death in June.Other classics of British children’s TV to have made the leap to the big screen include Postman Pat, Wallace & Gromit, Fireman Sam and Thomas the Tank Engine.Explore more on these topicsFilmFamily filmsChildren's TVnewsShareReuse this content"

More staff then arrived with supplies to cover it up.“I think it’s disgusting that they would just cover it up,” added Matteo, who witnessed arrests at a pro-Palestine protest in London on Saturday. “They are clearly afraid of the response this will get.”View image in fullscreenSecurity guards in front of the screened-off Banksy mural at the Royal Courts of Justice.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesPolice detainedclose to 900 peoplein the demonstration against the banning of the protest group Palestine Action.A spokesperson for Defend Our Juries, which has organised protests against the banning of Palestine Action, said:“When the law is used as a tool to crush civil liberties, it does not extinguish dissent – it strengthens it. As Banksy’s artwork shows, the state can try to strip away our civil liberties, but we are too many in number and our resolve to stand against injustice cannot be beaten.”Banksy’s Instagram photo showed a lawyer and a cyclist passing the artwork, which is on the wall of the Queen’s Building at the court complex.The protester was depicted lying on the ground holding a white placard with a red mark on it resembling blood.A HM Courts and Tribunals Service spokesperson said the artwork was being taken down as the court was a listed building and they were “obliged to maintain its original character”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Furthermore, at the time, Colbert had justcriticizedCBS for paying $16m tosettlea lawsuit filed by Trump over the president’sclaimsthat the network edited footage of an interview with Kamala Harris to make her look better in her unsuccessful White House run in 2024.Legal experts widely believed CBS could defeat Trump’s claims of defamation in court, and on his show, Colbert dismissed the settlement as “a big fat bribe”.Colbert announced three days later that he had been informed of his show’s cancellation. Trump – who had frequently been the butt of jokes on the Late Show – relished the news, posting on his Truth Social platform: “I absolutely love that Colbert was fired.”The Late Show host replied that it had always been a dream of his for a sitting president to celebrate the end of his career andtoldTrump on air: “Go fuck yourself.”Regulators at the Trump administration-controlled Federal Communications Commission laterapprovedParamount’s sale to Skydance.CBS’s chair of television media, George Cheeks, in August tried to separate the cancellation of Colbert’s show from the politics of Trump’s second presidency. Instead, he blamed financial headwinds confronting the late-night talkshow format.“The challenge in late-night is that the advertising marketplace is in significant secular decline,” Cheekssaidat a news conference after Skydance’s takeover of Paramount. “We are huge fans of Colbert – we love the show.“Unfortunately, the economics made it a challenge for us to keep going.”The US entertainment news outletVarietynoted that many television industry insiders saw the Late Show’s Emmy win on Sunday as a reaction to public consternation generated by its cancellation at the hands of Paramount.Cancelling Colbert, bribery, an $8bn deal: what’s going on at Paramount?Read moreColbert’s Late Show had amassed more than 30 Emmy nominations before Sunday’s victory by director Jim Hoskinson. Only AMC’sBetter Call Saulhad more Emmy nominations without a win, havingmemorably loston all of more than 50 nominations it had amassed during its run of six seasons, according to Variety.The Late Show was also nominated in the category of talk series in themain Emmy ceremonyscheduled for 14 September.Emmy awards individually won by the outgoing Late Show host stem from his run on Comedy Central’s The Colbert Report. He had also been honored by the Emmys for a special aired on Showtime during the 2020 election that saw Trump’s first presidency end in defeat toJoe Biden.That production was titled “Stephen Colbert’s Election Night 2020: Democracy’s Last Stand: Building Back America Great Again Better 2020.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsStephen ColbertEmmysDonald TrumpUS politicsAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

The pledge had 1,200 signers as of Sunday night.The pledge, shared exclusively with the Guardian,claims to draw inspiration from the cultural boycott that contributed to the end of apartheid in South Africa.It commits signatories not to screen films, appear at or otherwise work with what it considers complicit institutions – including festivals, cinemas, broadcasters and production companies. Examples of complicity include “whitewashing or justifying genocide and apartheid, and/or partnering with the government committing them”.“We answer the call of Palestinian film-makers, who haveurgedthe international film industry to refuse silence, racism, and dehumanisation, as well as to ‘do everything humanly possible’ to end complicity in their oppression,” the statement reads.View image in fullscreenAyo Edebiri is one of the signatories.Photograph: Alessandra Benedetti/Corbis/Getty ImagesThe pledge was published by the group Film Workers for Palestine.Screenwriter David Farr, who is among the signatories, said in a statement: “As the descendant of Holocaust survivors, I am distressed and enraged by the actions of the Israeli state, which has for decades enforced an apartheid system on the Palestinian people whose land they have taken, and which is now perpetuating genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza.“In this context I cannot support my work being published or performed in Israel. The cultural boycott was significant in South Africa. It will be significant this time and in my view should be supported by all artists of conscience.”AnFAQaccompanying the pledge addresses how to determine which film entities are implicated, and states: “Israel’s major film festivals (including but not limited to Jerusalem film festival, Haifa international film festival, Docaviv and TLVFest) continue to partner with the Israeli government while it carries outwhat leading experts have defined as genocideagainst Palestinians in Gaza.“The vast majority of Israeli film production and distribution companies, sales agents, cinemas and other film institutions have never endorsed the full, internationally recognised rights of the Palestinian people,” it adds.The pledge notes that there are “a few Israeli film entities that are not complicit” and advises following “guidelines set by Palestinian civil society”.The film industry workers also clarify in the FAQ that the pledge does not prohibit them from working with Israeli individuals.“The call is for film workers to refuse to work with Israeli institutions that are complicit in Israel’s human rights abuses against the Palestinian people,” the statement reads. “This refusal takes aim at institutional complicity, not identity. There are also 2 million Palestinians with Israeli citizenship, and Palestinian civil society has developed context sensitive guidelines for that community.”The pledge does not explicitly mention the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which is the most prominent civil society effort identifying what it considers complicity with Israel. But it is one of the most prominent cultural boycott efforts announced against Israel since the assault on Gaza started, coming nearly one year aftermore than 1,000 writersannounced a similar pledge.View image in fullscreenYorgos Lanthimos.Photograph: Mickael Chavet/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe effort invokes Filmmakers United Against Apartheid, an initiative founded in 1987 by Jonathan Demme, Martin Scorsese and other prominent film-makers whorefusedto screen their films inapartheid-eraSouth Africa.In a statement responding to the pledge, the Israeli Producers Association said that “the signatories of this petition are targeting the wrong people”.“For decades, we Israeli artists, storytellers, and creators have been the primary voices allowing audiences to hear and witness the complexity of the conflict, including Palestinian narratives and criticism of Israeli state policies. We work with Palestinian creators, telling our shared stories and promoting peace and an end to violence through thousands of films, TV series, and documentaries,” they wrote in a statement sent to the Guardian.“This call for boycott is profoundly misguided. By targeting us – the creators who give voice to diverse narratives and foster dialogue – these signatories are undermining their own cause and attempting to silence us. This shortsighted act seeks to eliminate precisely the collaborative efforts working toward ending violence and achieving peace. We will not allow this and will push back in our efforts to end violence and bring just peace to our region for the benefit of all,” they added.The newcampaign comes amid a growing number of entertainment industry initiatives to protest Israel’s war in Gaza. Earlier this summer, hundreds of actors and film-makers – including Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal, Ralph Fiennes and director Guillermo del Toro –signed an open lettercondemning what they described as the film industry’s silence over Israel’s deadly military campaign in Gaza.Activists hope to shift Venice film festival focus on to crisis in GazaRead moreMany of the same figures who have signed the new pledge were alsoamong the hundredsof Screen Actors Guild members who, last year, urged union leadership to protect members from being blacklisted over their views on Palestine. More recently, the Norwegian Actors’ Equity Association recommended its members refuse to work with certain Israeli cultural institutions.Last summer,Variety reportedthat more than 65 Palestinian film-makers also signed a letter in which they accused Hollywood of “dehumanising” Palestinians on screen over decades.In that letter, the film-makerscalled ontheir international colleagues “to stand against working with production companies that are deeply complicit in dehumanising Palestinians, or whitewashing and justifying Israel’s crimes against us”.Last week,The Voice of Hind Rajab, a new film about a five-year-old girl killed by Israeli forces in Gaza last year, received a 23-minute standing ovationafter its premiereat theVenice film festival. Brad Pitt, Jonathan Glazer, Phoenix, Rooney Mara and Alfonso Cuarón were among the executive producers on the film.Explore more on these topicsFilmIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I feel this show … will be a benchmark for me. A moment in my life when I look back and go forward. A true celebration of living.”Emin, most famous for Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-1995 (The Tent) and My Bed, has opened her own art school and embarked on a new body of work since she was diagnosed with aggressive bladder cancer five years ago.Why I Never Became a Dancer, one of Emin’s works from 1995.Photograph: Tracey EminThe exhibition will chart Emin’s work from her “first life” through to her second, post-illness and surgery.

You judge a city by its art,” she added in celebration of the gallery’s 25th birthday.The survey exhibition will bring together more than 90 works including painting, video, textile, neon, sculpture and installation, demonstrating Emin’s “uncompromising confessional approach to sharing experiences of love, trauma and personal growth”.View image in fullscreenNeons are to be part of the exhibition.Photograph: Tracey EminThe Tate Modern said: “Emin’s commitment to unapologetic self-expression has transformed our understanding of what art can be and continues to influence contemporary art today, using the female body to explore passion, pain and healing.“Spanning her extraordinary 40-year practice – from seminal installations made in the 1990s, to recent paintings and bronzes going on display for the first time – A Second Life marks the most significant exhibition of Emin’s career, tracing the key life events that have shaped her journey and transformation.”The exhibition will begin by presenting works from Emin’s first solo exhibition at White Cube with a series of tiny photographs of her art school paintings from the 1980s which she destroyed following a difficult period of her life. It will include the documentary Why I Never Became a Dancer about her teenage years in Margate and other works centred around the seaside town where Emin now offers rent-free space to art students.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Busta Rhymes powered through a heavily bleeped medley of his rapid-fire bars alongside guests GloRilla, Spliff Star and Joyner Lucas, before accepting the award – named for a 1985 LL Cool J track – with a brief speech.“The next time y’all take 35 years to give me one of these, then I’ll talk as long as I want,” he joked, thanking his family, God, DJ Scratch, and the late Ananda Lewis, a 1990sMTVhost who “loved the culture and lifted us up” and died of cancer this year at the age of 52.Mariah Carey was presented with the Video Vanguard Award by Ariana Grande, becoming the eighth consecutive woman to win the evening’s top lifetime achievement honor.“I can’t believe I’m getting my first VMA tonight. I just have one question: what in the Sam Hill were you waiting for?” Carey joked, after performing a medley of her hits.“Music videos are my way of life, of bringing music to my own life,” she continued. “Let’s be honest, sometimes they’re just an excuse to bring the drama and do things I wouldn’t do in real life … Music evolves, but fun?

There is a ripple in the firmament, a vibration in the foundations, a bracing of the cosmos … yes,Mark Ruffalois preparing to Act again. This time, he stars in crime drama Task, created by Mare of Easttown’s Brad Inglesby, as a former priest turned FBI agent nursing a great sorrow in the suitably grey environs of suburban Philadelphia. Tom Brandis ends every day in a drunken semi-stupor and begins every morning with prayer and a head-dunk into an ice-filled sink. Do you think we might be in for a meditation on guilt, sin and the possibility of redemption? Yes, I wearily agree.So. Brandis is taken off the desk duties he has been assigned since his great sorrow. This is evidently connected to the sentencing hearing for a third-degree murder conviction he is due to attend next week, where his daughter Emily may be giving a family impact statement – but we will have to wait just long enough for it to feel outright manipulative before we get the full explanation of who killed who and how. Brandis is assigned to a new taskforce to investigate a series of armed break-ins at drug houses owned by the Dark Hearts biker gang, in the hope that arrests can be made before Philly is consumed by a turf war. He has three youngsters to help him: the charmingly arrogant, Catholic-raised Anthony (Fabien Frankel); the supremely competent Aleah (Thuso Mbedu); and the supremely incompetent Lizzie (Alison Oliver). Their single characteristics allow Brandis to prove his priestly credentials (God-talks with the lapsed Anthony), his generosity of spirit (this middle-aged man is not threatened by youthful ability!) and patience (I would return her to Quantico instantly, bearing a large label that read “Not fit for purpose”) and not much else.View image in fullscreenNot fit for purpose? … Mark Ruffalo, Alison Oliver, Thuso Mbedu and Fabien Frankel in Task.Photograph: 2025 Home Box Office, IncThe raids are being conducted by garbagemen and best friends Robbie (Tom Pelphrey) and Cliff (Raúl Castillo), who can tell from the trash cans on their route which dealers’ houses have recently disposed of drugs and filled up with cash. How they know which are Dark Hearts facilities and why they are specialising in those will again become clear in the fullness of time. They are accompanied on the raids by younger friend Peaches (Owen Teague), who you might suspect is marked for death the moment he expresses his joy at the fact that he has just become engaged. I couldn’t possibly comment.Apropos nothing, Task ticks all the expected boxes. There are bloody shootouts, corpses and bags full of fentanyl instead of cash grabbed in chaotic getaways which will then require selling. Which requires finding a buyer. Which requires becoming further enmeshed in the drugs world – and more identifiable to those seeking to destroy you for killing their men and taking their 12 kilos of fentanyl in the first place. Especially as you also kidnapped a child witness in the process.Now, Mare of Easttown was no picnic. But it had plenty of black humour and was full of vividly drawn, wholly believable family relationships and friendships that gave it a sense of life in the round. The criminality mattered because it affected people in all walks of life. Task, by contrast, is relentlessly bleak, humourless and narratively airless. It is not just the Brandis family that is crushed by terrible griefs and burdens. Robbie’s wife has left him and he is mourning the death of his brother Billy. His niece Maeve (Emilia Jones), Billy’s daughter, is dying by inches under the strain of looking after Robbie’s motherless children, which does not seem a fair trade for letting him move in with her after her father’s death left her with a house.It flattens the characters into ciphers, deadens the story and as time goes on, makes the whole thing inescapably boring. It is not as if we haven’t seen everything on show before. Let’s find another way to propel a plot – or maybe even find another plot entirely – especially in Philadelphia.But if formulaic yet weighty stuff is your bag, if gestures towards bigger issues rather than actual interrogations of them are all you’re up to at the moment, then a relatively enjoyable Task lies before you. For anything else, you can always rewatch Mare of Easttown.Task aired on Sky Atlantic and is on Now in the UK.

Robbie (Tom Pelphrey) is a binman by day, coping with the death of his brother while looking after his kids and niece, and maybe even looking for love. By night, though, he and his mate Cliff (Raúl Castillo) dress in Halloween costumes and burgle members of a drug-dealing biker gang. Enter Mark Ruffalo’s Tom, an FBI agent dealing with his own family bereavement, and put on the case with an inexperienced taskforce before a turf war escalates.

That could describe who he tends to be in “real” life (whatever that means in this context) but it’s also what he’s playing in Rental Family.The feelgood dramedy – or at least that’s what it tries so hard to be – is about an actual service in Japan that supplies actors who perform as bit players in everyday people’s lives. They’re hired by clients to fake it in roles as a family member, a friend or even the cheering audience at a karaoke bar. The premise packs meta layers and gives Fraser the opportunity to inhabit multiple roles, while turning the lens back on the audience to consider what we’re looking for in the movie(s). Unfortunately, when it comes to Rental Family, it’s just not that deep.Bad Apples review – Saoirse Ronan’s dark, school-set satire doesn’t go far enoughRead moreThe new film from co-writer and director Hikari (who helmed three episodes of the sharp and sinister Netflix series Beef) is enamoured (or even consumed) by the very artificiality it’s about, and too timid to scratch past the surface in a way that might threaten the easy laughs and mawkishness it’s ultimately after. And that’s too bad considering the cast on hand, not just Fraser – whose sad eyes give way to a well of emotions and thoughtfulness – but also the excellent and underutilised Mari Yamamoto (Monarch: Legacy of Monsters). She plays the more seasoned actor-for-rent colleague, who is regularly humiliated in gigs pretending to be mistresses making ritualised apologies to betrayed wives on behalf of their spineless husbands. As underwritten as her scenes may be, Yamamoto left me wishing the movie was about her.Instead, it belongs to Fraser, an Oscar winner for Darren Aronofsky’s oppressive The Whale – which falls on the extreme opposite of the mood spectrum from Rental Family. His Phillip is a struggling American actor in Japan whose embarrassing claim to fame is a hilariously tacky toothpaste commercial where he plays a superhero conquering gingivitis. Why Phillip chooses to remain in Tokyo is largely left for Fraser to suggest in the way his character ambles through the city. He bounces from audition to audition, seemingly lost in his own emotions, between crowds that flow rapidly and with intention, which Hikari captures with lovely views of the city.Phillip stumbles into the rental family game after his agent instructs him just to show up at a location for a gig that turns out to be a mock funeral, where the corpse, who turns out to be the client, gleefully rises from the dead – a hilarious introduction to this curious world. Phillip, reluctant at first with all the emotional deception at work, agrees to sign on full-time, coaxed by the firm’s owner (Takehiro Hira) who’s in need of a “token white guy” and insists that the fake affections they’re selling are ultimately uplifting and cathartic.Hikari hurriedly, and cloyingly, makes the case for this trade’s sentimental value. Phillip becomes a best friend to a lonely man who just needs company to play video games, pretends to be a journalist showing his appreciation to an ageing actor slipping into dementia (Akira Emoto, wonderful) and plays a fake husband in an elaborate sham marriage to a young girl who is trying to free herself from a restrictive household. He celebrates the latter job well done by spending the night with a sex worker, a charming exchange where the film-makers can’t resist spelling out how transactional affections are not just common but time-honoured.The job gets especially icky, and pretty preposterous, when Phillip is hired to fill in for the absent father to a biracial child named Mia (Shannon Gorman, precocious). It’s a temporary and irresponsible ploy to help the child secure admission into a coveted private school. To make the ruse convincing, the mother insists her vulnerable daughter not be let in on the ruse, basically setting Mia up to be abandoned again.Hikari and company mostly skim over the tension in a movie seemingly built out of highlight reels and lacking connective tissue. They only briefly acknowledge the heavy complications their scenario entails because their film would much rather indulge in calculated and aggressively cute moments and trite monologues, all set against postcard-ready shots of Tokyo’s scenery and culture.The whole movie basically affirms Phillip’s initial reservations. It’s not just his clients that are being emotionally manipulated. It’s us too.Rental Family is screening at theToronto film festivaland will be released on 21 November in the US, 26 December in Australia and January in the UKExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewDrama filmsToronto film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The target is easier than ever and too often, so are the jokes, incisive satire proving hard to nail when the subjects have become so indistinguishably cartoonish. The same has become true of the wealthy in general and recent films that have tried to lampoon either have felt lazy, pointing and laughing at something that’s stopped being funny a long time ago.Roofman review – Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst lift fact-based crime caperRead moreThere’s an initial kick then to the new film from the French music video provocateur turned film-maker Romain Gavras, who finds a more precise section of the VIP area to ridicule: performative environmentalists. As the world continues to burn, artists and those who use that word loosely, have attached themselves to the crisis whether it be to make themselves seem worthier to their fanbase or to make terrible art in its name. There’s both here in Sacrifice, a biting comedy thriller that lands us at another meaningless gala, set inside a remote location in Greece. We arrive with troubled movie star Mike (Chris Evans), panicking over his perceived hair loss (his assistant, played by Sam Richardson, assures him that another trip to Turkey is easily scheduled) and eager to move past a rather embarrassing viral clip of him ranting with a flame-thrower at the premiere of his action vehicle Octavius: The Last Centurion. He’s technically there to do good for the environment but he’s really just there to do good for his image, something that suffers a setback when he sees Bezos-styled billionaire Ben (Vincent Cassel) showing a Daily Mail TikTok of his freakout to others. Ben’s wife Gloria (Salma Hayek) is a pop star whose latest album is designed to be from the perspective of a flood.After Ben announces a new mining scheme that he claims will actually help the ocean (!), Mike takes the stage for another rant, turning himself into an internet joke once again. But things are about to get a lot worse as a group of cultish eco-terrorists (dubbed “Green Isis” on the ground) take the event hostage, pausing a dance performance designed to help save the environment (featuring Charli xcx in a cameo as Mother Nature). They are led by Joan (Anya Taylor-Joy) who announces that the world is days from extinction and to prevent a volcano from erupting, they must throw some celebrities in it.It’s the kind of set-up one might expect from Ruben Östlund and Taylor-Joy herself starred in the adjacent eat-the-rich foodie satire The Menu but Gavras, and co-writer Will Arbery, known for Succession, find their own spark in the witty and well-observed first act. Their jabs are obvious but amusing and there’s something recognisably nauseating about the self-importance of hearing a certain brand of modern celebrity convinced their work will somehow contribute to global betterment. But as we leave the event, as the quest truly begins, Gavras starts to lose his grasp, less confident when tackling a world outside the poppy excess he’s come to know (and sometimes hate) so well. The larking around starts to turn more serious but the film can’t quite decide just how seriously we should be taking it and debates over proven science v fixed beliefs go from circular and repetitive to genuinely baffling when a last actJohn Malkovichappears.What keeps us glued throughout is Evans, who gives an unusually top-tier performance, finding space to make his spiralling actor both pathetically funny and affectingly human. It’s the kind of film one can imagine Evans taking on back when he was still taking chances and before he was completely subsumed within the Marvel universe. He’s technically out now but he’s not really found much of a groove since, getting involved with some of the shoddiest streaming projects of the last few years (Ghosted, Red One, The Gray Man, Pain Hustlers), bad films that he’s also been bad in, adding a worrying question mark to his star status. Gavras has given him perhaps his greatest role to date here and he runs with it. Cassel has far less to do but has fun ragging on him (“I can’t believe I’m going to die next to a Golden Globe loser”) and there’s a wordless yet utterly transfixing performance from Jade Croot, who was similarly chilling in this year’s Sundance horrorRabbit Trap.They make for a fine cast (Hayek is underused yet in small moments provides a reminder of just how great she can be at comedy) but Gavras leaves them and us stranded on the way to his out-there ending. Even before we’re looking into a volcano, Sacrifice has fallen over the edge.Sacrifice is screening at theToronto film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewToronto film festivalFestivalsChris EvansAnya Taylor-JoySalma HayekCharli xcxreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’m sitting at a vast outdoor table in Herefordshire looking out over rows of vines. On the horizon, the Malvern Hills ripple towards the Black Mountains; in front of me is a selection of local produce: cheeses from Monkland Dairy, 6 miles away, salad leaves from Lane Cottage (8 miles), charcuterie from Trealy Farm (39 miles), cherries from Moorcourt Farm (3 miles), broccoli quiche (2 miles) and glasses of sparkling wine, cassis and apple juice made just footsteps away. This off-grid feast is the final stop on White Heron Estate’s ebike farm tour – and I’m getting the lie of the land with every bite.View image in fullscreenBefore eating, our small group pedalled along a two-hour route so pastorally pretty it would make Old MacDonald sigh. Skirting purple-hued borage fields, we’ve zipped in and out of woodland, down rows of apple trees and over patches of camomile, and learned how poo from White Heron’s chickens is burnt in biomass boilers to generate heat. “Providing habitats for wildlife is important, but we need to produce food as well,” says our guide Jo Hilditch, who swapped a career in PR for farming when she inherited the family estate 30 years ago.View image in fullscreenShe’s electric: the writer gets on her ebike.Photograph: Rhiannon BattenThe tours offer an immersive way of seeing British agriculture in action. Pausing in the estate’s blackcurrant fields, Jo pulls bottles of chilled Ribena from a basket for us to drink (White Heron produces 5% of Ribena’s blackcurrant supply) and encourages us to taste the fruit: fat and sweet, the berries are a whole different entity to the wincingly sharp little beads growing in my own garden.As if by arrangement, bells start ringing from the church’s stand-alone belfry as I cycle bySo lyrical do I wax about the blackcurrants that, after I arrive at my accommodation for the night, the estate’s homely Field Cottage, there’s a knock at the door: the delivery of a punnet to take home. I add it to the cottage’s guest hamper, which is brimming with tangy Worcester Hop cheese, local raspberries, some of the estate’s own apple juice and a miniature of its treacly, sharp-sweet cassis.I don’t have to worry about working it off. The following day I’m back on the ebike on a new self-guided ride around north Herefordshire. One of a handful of routes the estate has curated around the region’s farm shops, cider-makers, cheese producers and farm-to-fork restaurants, the trails link up some delectable pit stops in different corners of the county, some of which feature on Visit Herefordshire’s new food safaris.View image in fullscreenThe estate’s ebikes come into their own on some of the rougher tracksSetting out while the early morning mist is still loitering over the estate’s orchards, I swing over an old grass-covered railway line on to a quiet lane running between fields of hay, then wheel along to pretty Pembridge, with its rows of tipsy-angled black-and-white buildings. As if by arrangement, the bells start ringing from the church’s stand-alone belfry as I pass, giving the impression of a medieval rocket about to launch. I stop in the village stores to pick up a loaf from Peter Cooks Bread and a coffee at Bloom & Grind before pedalling on to Eardisland.An e-biking tour of England’s newest forestRead moreThe mist lifts as I arrive, revealing a picturesque swirl of half-timbered buildings, a dainty 17th-century dovecote and an elegant bridge over the River Arrow. There’s no time to dawdle, though. I’m only partway into my 29-mile route and it’s mid-morning already.I cycle down blissfully empty lanes to Monkland Dairy, set up three decades ago by ex-teacher Kaz Hindle and her husband, Mark. Having “bought a cheese shop because of a drunken dinner”, Kaz tells me the dairy came about when one of the shop’s employees mentioned her grandmother’s 1917 recipe for cheese. The grandmother turned out to be Ellen Yeld, one-time “chief dairy instructress” for Herefordshire, so the recipe was a good one. The Hindles refined it further to produce Little Hereford, a cheddar-like cheese that’s now the dairy’s flagship product.View image in fullscreenThe tour offers pit stops to refuel on local produce.Photograph: Rhiannon BattenWith Kaz semi-retired, the cheesemaking side of things has been taken over by ex-chef and former customer Dean Storey. Showing me the cheese cave and the dairy’s vintage cast-iron presses, Storey tells that me he makes 30 to 40 Little Herefords a week and up to 300 of the dairy’s deliciously creamy blue monks, plus some “more controversial” cheeses such as ones featuring garlic and chive; “My kids love it in pasta,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lunch beckons a few fields further on. The Riverside at Aymestrey is a pretty black-and-white inn beside the River Lugg. The hillside above it operates as a semi-wild kitchen garden. Among a bounty of damsons, cobnuts, jerusalem artichokes, fennel, lovage, kale, gooseberries and apples are pigs and chickens. “The garden started as a lockdown project and now we have 2.5 acres (1 hectare),” says chef-patron Andy Link, as he shows me around. “It means we can work in food metres rather than food miles.”View image in fullscreenSoup at the Riverside at Aymestrey, which is supplied by its own semi-wild kitchen gardenI’m transported back to the garden when I bite into an appetiser of summer veg croustade – a mouthful of crunchy peas, beans and mint enveloped with crushed seeds. It’s followed by trout cured in gin and lemon verbena, with gooseberries and tendrils of sea purslane, then fall-apart local beef fillet and cheek from a farm 11 miles away. But it’s the dainty, cloud-like savarin I have for dessert that keeps this hyper-Herefordshire meal on my mind as I wobble back on to my bike for the ride back to White Heron; it’s soaked in a delicate syrup flavoured with pine tips.The following morning, I do some foraging of my own, driving south to Longtown to meet wild food expert Liz Knight, of Forage Fine Foods,on her local patch. As we walk out along an old drovers’ road to the fields past her converted barn, Liz teaches me to look at the landscape not just as a view but as a foodscape. There may be an extraordinary panorama of the Cat’s Back hill across the valley, but we try to keep our eyes down: beneath our feet is pineapple weed, whose fruity flowers can be used to top salads or spice up cordials, broadleaf plantain, which can be fried like kale chips, and docks, whose ground seeds can be baked in bread and crackers.View image in fullscreenGoing wild: Liz Knight of Forage Fine Foods.Photograph: Rhiannon BattenAt one point, we come across an ancient linden tree, whose colossal gnarled trunk makes it a contender for the real-life Magic Faraway Tree, though Liz says that its real sorcery lies in its cucumber-scented flowers; delicious on salads, they are also said to help calm the nervous system. Nearby is a patch of yarrow. A forager’s cure-all, yarrow’s many medicinal properties include calming bites and stings, balancing hormones and soothing sore throats. Picking a few heads, we stroll back to Liz’s kitchen to steep the flowers with honeysuckle in vodka to use as a tincture.Back home that evening, I make a salad using radishes, runner beans and soft dorstone cheese from the Oakchurch Farm Shop, another pin on Herefordshire’s food safari map. As I slice the veg, I think of everyone I’ve met over the last few days. Seeing such careful tending of food first-hand has left me not just with the lie of the land, I realise, but with the experience of truly savouring it too.The trip was provided by White Heron; its two- to three-hour ebikefarm tour and tastingis£50pp;full-day slow cycle rides£80pp; self-catering accommodation sleeps four, from £509 for three nights.Half-day foraging courseswith Liz Knightfrom£55pp. For more informationseevisitherefordshire.co.ukExplore more on these topicsCycling holidaysFood and drinkEngland holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysBritish food and drinkFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The easiest way to make the necessary holes in your sliced bread is with a round pastry cutter – or a heart-shaped one for fun. Break the eggs into their bread ‘baskets’, then fry up their “hats” to go alongside. To make this a grownup rather than a nursery dinner, serve with lemon-and-paprika-spiked chard, or spinach or kale, if that’s what you have; I am growing a surfeit of chard, so I always need new ways to use it up.Eggs in a basket with smoky chardPrep10 minCook10 minServes2(but scale up if you’re hungry)2tbsp olive oil1garlic clove, peeled and finely sliced150g rainbow chard, roughly chopped1tsp hot smoked paprika1tsp flaky sea saltJuice of ½ lemon2 large slices goodwhite bread or sourdough2 mediumeggs50gGreek yoghurt, to servePut a tablespoon of the oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat, add the garlicand fry for 30 seconds. Add the chard and paprika, and stir-fry for three to four minutes, just until the chard has wilted (this will take less time if it’s quite young). Season with a half-teaspoon of flaky sea salt and the lemon juice, then taste and add more salt as needed. Transfer the chard to a bowl and wipe out the pan with kitchen roll.While the chard is cooking, use a round cutter to stamp out a circle from the centre of each slice of bread. Put the remaining oil in the now-empty chard pan on a medium heat, then lay in the bread (one slice at a time, if the pan’s not big enough for both) and its cut-out circle, too, if there’s room and fry for a minute just to get a little colour. Flip over, break an egg into the hole in the centre and fry for a minute or two, until the white is just set and the yolk runny; if you prefer your eggs over easy, by all means flip for 30 seconds to seal the other side.Scatter each basket with a pinch of sea salt and serve with the smoky chard, fried bread circles and a big spoon of yoghurt alongside.Explore more on these topicsEggsQuick and easyFoodSnacksBreadVegetablesMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

Typically, they might be torn over yoghurt and granola for breakfast or baked into a tart with frangipane, but they belong in the savoury kitchen, too. Combined with salt, savoury ingredients and a little vinegar, a good fig will bring a gorgeous sweet-sour note to your dinner table.Polenta with sweet-and-sour figs and pecorinoAs the warmer months come to an end, I like to cook with both comfort and freshness in mind. Rich, buttery, warming polenta is offset with a vibrant, bright, jammy topping of onions, rosemary and torn figs. Shave over some pecorino for a funky, savoury twang, and you’ve got a dish that’ll scratch that late-summer itch.Prep15minCook45minServes4For the polenta250ml whole milk150g coarse cornmeal30g butterFor the sweet-and-sour figsOlive oil2 red onions,peeled and thinly sliced10g rosemary(2-3 sprigs),leaves stripped and finely choppedSea salt and black pepper20g brown sugar20ml aged balsamic vinegar6-8 ripe figsPecorino romano, to servePut 600ml water and the milk in a pan, then whisk in the cornmeal. Set the pan over a medium heat and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Turn down the heat to low and let it tick over, stirring every now and then – if things start to get a bit too thick, add a splash of water to loosen. You don’t need to stand there whisking away the entire time; just check in on the polenta every five to 10 minutes, and give it a good stir.Meanwhile, set a frying pan on a medium heat and add a shot of olive oil. Add the onions, half the rosemary and a pinch of salt, then toss in the warm oil and cook for 10-12 minutes, or until the onions are starting to caramelise. Add the sugar and vinegar, and continue cooking until the onions are jammy. Tear the figs in half, drop them into the pan, stir to coat, and finish with the remaining rosemary.Once the polenta has had 45 minutes or so in the pan, whisk in the butter. This is the moment to adjust the texture; I like my polenta gently to relax into the bowl. If it’s too thick, add a little water or milk; if it’s too thin, keep cooking. Spoon the polenta into warm bowls and top with the jammy onions. Use a mandoline or cheese grater to shave some pecorino over the top and serve.Roast chicken legs with beans and figsView image in fullscreenBen Lippett’s roast chicken legs with beans and figs.Photograph: Matthew Hague/The Guardian. Food styling: Lucy Turnbull. Prop styling: Anna Wilkins. Food styling assistant: Catarina Cardoso.A chicken leg is, for my money, the ultimate midweek ingredient. With very little effort, it really sings and can be cooked with little hands-on time. This traybake uses slightly under-ripe figs, orange, fennel seeds and capers to create a chicken and bean dish that’ll fly into your weekly rotation. When out of season, swap the figs for dried fruit such as apricots, dates or prunes.Prep10minCook1 hr 15 minServes44 skin-on, bone-in chicken legsFine sea salt3 onions,peeled and cut into wedges4 tbsp capers5 garlic cloves,peeled, gently squashed with a knife, but left wholePeeled zest of 1 orange1 tbsp fennel seedsOlive oil700g jarcooked white beans,not drained6-8 slightly underripe figs2-3 tbsp sherry vinegar15g fresh oreganoExtra-virgin olive oilHeat the oven to 245C (225C fan)/480F/gas 9½, and season the chicken legs with salt. Put the onion wedges, capers, garlic, orange zest and fennel seeds in a roasting tin that’s just big enough to hold the chicken legs in a single layer, then drizzle generously with olive oil, season with salt and give everything a good mix. Sit the chicken legs on top, slide into the oven for 25 minutes, then turn down the heat to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and roast for another 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is very tender.Take the tin out of the oven and lift out the chicken legs, leaving all the cooking juices behind. Add the beans and their liquid to the tray, then cut the figs into 1cm slices and toss them in, too. Sit the chicken back on top and return to the oven for 10-15 minutes, until the juices have reduced and thickened.Take out of the the oven, set aside the chicken and finish off the beans with the orange juice and a splash of sherry vinegar. Scatter fresh oregano over the top and mingle with the beans. Divide the beans and figs between four plates and top with a roast chicken leg. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and serve.How I Cook: A Chef’s Guide to Really Good Home Cooking, by Ben Lippett, is published by HarperCollins at £26.
